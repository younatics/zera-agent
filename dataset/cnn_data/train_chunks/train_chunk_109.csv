"(CNN) -- South Korea's Kim Yu-Na performed a flawless free skate on Thursday to handily claim Olympic gold in the women's figure skating finals and earn the first figure skating medal for her country. Kim, who led after the short program earlier this week, defeated Japan's Mao Asada, who won silver. Canada's Joannie Rochette, who competed just days after her mother died, won the bronze. ""I have been dreaming about this moment and I can't believe that this moment is here,"" she said afterward. Kim won by 23 points, a huge margin in figure skating, reaffirming the 19-year-old's status as world champion. Skating to Concerto in F by George Gershwin, she breezed through a triple lutz, triple flip, triple salchow and the combination of a triple lutz and triple toeloop. She said she was shocked to see her score -- a 150.06 for the free skating portion. Her final overall score was 228.56. ""I waited a long time for the Olympics, and it feels like a large weight has been lifted off,"" she said. Her coach Brian Orser said Kim has been calm throughout her Olympic experience. ""She embraced the entire Olympic experience,"" he said. ""It's everything I'd ever imagined for her. To see her live, it is sensational."" South Korean media celebrated her win, with headlines reading: ""We are proud Kim Yu-Na, nation 'jumps' with golden performance"" in Sports Seoul and ""Netizens emotional: We write Kim Yu-Na and read it goddess"" in My Daily Sports. ""The whole nation was watching, even the president,"" journalist Brett Cole told CNN from Seoul. ""The whole nation literally stopped for Yu-Na's performance.""  Cole described Kim as somewhat of a girl next door, down to earth -- but she was carrying the hopes of a nation on her shoulders. Read more about Kim's popularity in South Korea .

"(CNN) -- Lindsey Vonn completed a hat-trick of World Cup victories in the space of three days at Haus Im Ennstal in Austria as she claimed Sunday's super-G in fine style. The American skier powered down the Krummholz course in one minute 26.69 seconds to beat Swede Anja Paerson by over half a second. Nadia Fanchini of Italy and Martina Schild of Switzerland were tied for third place. Vonn's super-G success followed victories on Friday and Saturday in downhill races and showed she has fully recovered from the arm injury she sustained in a giant slalom event last month. She is the first female racer to win on three straight days since Germany's Katja Seizinger in 1997 and it was her 28th World Cup win. Vonn, from Minnesota, is also the first skier from the United States to achieve this feat. To cap a superb week for the 26-year-old, she extends her overall World Cup lead to 192 points over Maria Riesch of Germany and is well-placed to retain the title. Vonn told her official Web site www.lindseyvonn.com that her hat-trick of World Cup victories was one of the major achievements of her career. ""Today was difficult because I put a bit of extra pressure on myself,"" she admitted. ""But right now I'm on cloud nine, it couldn't get much better than this,"" she added. Vonn will go into the Vancouver Olympics next February as a warm favorite in the speed events of downhill and super-G as she bids for a first Olympic medal of any color. In men's World Cup slalom action on Sunday, an incredible second run by Julien Lizeroux of France gave him victory at Adelboden in Switzerland. Lizeroux came from 12th after the first run to win with a combined time of one minute 51.88 seconds. Austria's Marcel Hirscher finished second with Croatia's Ivica Kostelic in third. Austrian Benjamin Raich stretched his lead in the overall standings after claiming fourth. He has 62 points more than Switzerland's Carlo Janka, who skied out on the first leg in front of his home fans.","Lindsey Vonn completes superb hat-trick of wins in three days on World Cup circuit .

"(CNN) -- Home favorite Roger Federer is through to the second round of the Swiss Indoors tournament in Basel after a straight sets victory over Italian Potito Starace on Monday. Third seed Federer, a four-time winner of the tournament, will now face either Brazilian Thomas Bellucci or Jarkko Nieminen of Finland after securing a 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 success against his world ranked 54th opponent -- who is known more as a clay-court specialist. Federer, who is behind Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray in the seedings for the event, has not competed since playing for Switzerland in the Davis Cup in September, because of a succession of niggling injuries. And although he has won only one ATP Tour event in 2011, in Doha in the first week of the year, world number four Federer has reached the quarterfinals in 11 of the 13 tournaments he has played. ""My focus now is well at Basel -- and the next round is my next priority,"" Federer told reporters. ""Last year I won here and in London and also had match points in the Paris semis. ""I know I can play well at the end of the season. If I'm going to make a ranking move, that's what it's going to take,"" he added. There was a surprise in Monday's other match, with eighth-seeded Serb Viktor Troicki going down 4-6 7-6 6-2 to 2005 runner-up Marcos Baghdatis in a marathon match lasting just 15 minutes short of three hours. Baghdatis had also beaten Troicki in the semifinals of the Malaysian Open in Kuala Lumpur last month. Meanwhile, in the Valencia Open in Spain, Russian Nikolay Davydenko continued his comeback from injury with a superb 6-4 4-6 6-3 win over fifth seed Gilles Simon of France. The defeat almost certainly ends Simon's hopes of reaches the ATP World Tour Finals in London. He currently lies 12th in the standings with only the top eight qualifying. Davydenko will next meet Simon's compatriot, Nicolas Mahut who beat Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 7-6 (7-5) 6-2, in the last 16.","Roger Federer begins the Swiss Indoors tournament with victory over Potito Starace .

"(CNN) -- Boxing great Joe Frazier was laid to rest Monday in Philadelphia, one week after dying of liver cancer and four decades after capturing the world's attention in an epic showdown with Muhammad Ali. Ali was among those at Frazier's private funeral at Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church, along with other boxing luminaries such as promoter Don King and current World Boxing Council champion Bernard Hopkins, video from CNN affiliate CSN Philly showed. Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson and Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter were also in attendance. A program for the service billed it as the ""Homegoing Celebration of Joseph Frazier,"" offering friends and family one last chance to pay their respects to the late 67-year-old athlete. He died November 7, just a month after being diagnosed with liver cancer. Over his career, the former two-time heavyweight champion became a legend in his own right and personified the gritty working-class style of his hard-knuckled adopted hometown, Philadelphia -- the setting for the ""Rocky"" film series, starring Sylvester Stallone as hardscrabble boxer Rocky Balboa. Nutter earlier called Frazier the ""quintessential Philadelphia boxer."" ""You could hear him coming, snorting and grunting and puffing, like a steam engine climbing a steep grade,"" Bill Lyon wrote in a Philadelphia Inquirer column about Frazier, who was nicknamed ""Smokin' Joe."" Frazier used his devastating left hook with impunity during his professional career, retiring with a 32-4-1 record. Frazier bested Ali in 1971's ""Fight of the Century"" at Madison Square Garden. In the 15th round, Frazier landed perhaps the most famous left hook in history, catching Ali on the jaw and dropping the former champ for a four-count, according to Frazier's bio at the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Frazier left the ring as the undisputed champ after handing Ali his first professional loss. Ali won a 12-round decision in a January 1974, rematch, setting the stage for the classic ""Thrilla in Manila"" just outside of the Philippine capital in 1975. Ali took the early rounds, but Frazier rebounded before losing the last five rounds. By the end of the 14th, Frazier's eyes were nearly swollen shut, and his corner stopped the bout, according to the biography. After that loss to Ali, Frazier was knocked out by George Foreman in June 1976. He came back for a fight in 1981, but then retired from competition. Yet he remained linked to the sport and his adopted hometown, running a well-known boxing gym in Philadelphia for years.","A funeral is held in Philadelphia for famed boxer ""Smokin' Joe"" Frazier .

"(CNN) -- Caroline Wozniacki's quest for a first grand slam title and her reign as world No. 1 both ended on Tuesday after a quarterfinal defeat by defending champion Kim Clijsters at the Australian Open. Four-time grand slam winner Clijsters showed little sign of being hampered by the ankle injury she sustained during her fourth-round win against last year's runner-up Li Na as she won 6-3 7-6 (7-4) in one hour and 45 minutes. Wozniacki finished the last two seasons top of the world rankings and has been No. 1 seed for the last six majors. However, the 21-year-old Dane is now certain to fall below No. 2 Petra Kvitova and No. 3 Victoria Azarenka -- who is Clijsters' semifinal opponent on Thursday. Fourth seed Maria Sharapova, who plays fellow Russian Ekatarina Makarova in the last eight on Wednesday, could also take top spot -- a position she, like Clijsters, has held before. ""Kim is very experienced,"" Wozniacki, who was beaten by Clijsters in her only grand slam final at the 2009 U.S. Open, told reporters. ""I mean, she's a great player. Of course I really don't like losing. I try to go in and try to win every time I play, but today Kim was just that little bit better than me."" Wozniacki, who could slip to No. 4 in the world depending on Sharapova's results, insisted she is not concerned about losing her top ranking. ""I start laughing every time because the media talks to me like I'm finishing my career and I only have one year left and time is running out,"" she said. ""I still have a number of Australian Opens and a number of U.S. Opens and Wimbledons and French Opens left. ""In the end of the day, you can just do your best. You can't do anything more than that. If your best is good enough, that's great. If not, then it's just too good from the other person. I will come back not only once but more times."" Clijsters saved four match points in her victory over 2011 French Open champion Li and the Belgian looked as if she might be set for another struggle after letting a 5-2 lead slip in the second set. But the three-time U.S. Open winner rallied to take control of the tie break and advance to her seventh Australian Open semifinal as she beat a No. 1 for the first time in a grand slam. Having taken more than two years to win her first major title after first reaching the top of the world rankings, the current world No. 14 can sympathize with Wozniacki's plight. ""She's worked very hard to get to where she is, and she's one of the most consistent players. People are almost in a way almost blaming her for it. I think that's something that is really absurd,"" Clijsters said. ""I think it's all a matter of experience and improving, definitely improving and trying to learn from losses and become better every slam. Then she will definitely get there."" Eleventh seed Clijsters said she had gone to great lengths to ensure her ankle was ready. ""Instead of really focusing on the match you're focusing on trying to get the ankle as good as possible,"" the 28-year-old said. ""Laying on the couch, every 20 minutes ice, 20 minutes off, 20 minutes ice, 20 minutes off. Leg elevated. Lymphatic drainage, all that stuff. ""I had a light hit yesterday without really sidewards movement, just trying to get a feel for the ball, and then back to the icing and all that same routine all over again."" Azarenka earlier came from behind against Polish eighth seed Agnieszka Radwanska before winning 6-7 (0-7) 6-0 6-2. It was the 22-year-old's 18th victory in her last 21 matches. ""It was very important to see how I could adjust after not playing really well in the first set,"" said the Belorussian, whose only previous grand slam semifinal came at Wimbledon last year. ""I completely turned it around, so I'm really, really happy about that. Maybe two years ago I would be like, 'Okay it's not working today.' ""But today I really tried to forget about the first set and start from zero and really fight hard, take it one at a time and keep going."" Wednesday's quarterfinals pit the Czech Republic's Kvitova against Italian world No. 48 Sara Errani and 2008 champion Sharapova against 56th-ranked Makarova -- who beat five-time Australian Open winner Serena Williams in the fourth round.","Top seed Caroline Wozniacki loses to Kim Clijsters at the Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer ended Novak Djokovic's 43-match unbeaten run on Friday to set up another French Open final showdown with longtime tennis rival Rafael Nadal. Second seed Djokovic had been seeking to equal John McEnroe's 1984 record of 42 successive wins at the start of a season, but was denied his first final appearance at Roland Garros by the 16-time grand slam champion. Federer, the 2009 winner in Paris, triumphed 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 3-6 7-6 (7-5) in three hours and 39 minutes in one of the all-time classic matches to prevent Djokovic taking top spot in the world rankings from Nadal. The Spaniard, seeking to clinch a record sixth French Open title, booked his place in Sunday's final with a 6-4 7-5 6-4 win over British fourth seed Andy Murray in the opening semi. Can Federer stop Nadal equaling Borg's record? ""I had nerves and this wasn't even the final,"" Federer, who has never lost a grand slam match after leading by two sets, told reporters. ""I have worked a lot in my life and it's for these types of matches. It was certainly one of my greatest matches in an extraordinary atmosphere. ""It was probably the best match I have played this year. There were breaks, break backs. It's always intense when we play and I wanted to make it as physical as I could."" Djokovic had been unstoppable this year, winning seven titles as he beat Federer in his first three events of 2011. But the Swiss third seed has battled through a disappointing year so far by his high standards to give himself a chance of extending his record tally of grand slams. The 29-year-old won the first set in 70 minutes and the second in just 45 before his Serbian opponent dug deep to reduce the deficit. The fourth set continued the extraordinarily high level of tennis on show, as Djokovic broke to lead 5-4 before Federer immediately returned the favor to level. A cheeky drop shot gave him the opening point of the tie-break, and Djokovic saved two match-points -- the second with an ace -- to give himself hope at 6-5. But, with darkness growing at the local time of 9.35 p.m., Federer showed immaculate poise to blast one of his own down the middle to set up his 25th career meeting with Nadal. ""All credit to him. He went for his shots, but there are no regrets for me,"" Djokovic said after his first match since last Sunday, following the withdrawal of his quarterfinal opponent Fabio Fognini. ""He deserved to win. We were part of a very good match. But I had a great tournament. It's been the best five months of my career and I knew it had to end some time."" The 24-year-old subsequently revealed he would miss the start of the grass-court season as he pulled out of next week's tournament at England's Queen's Club in London due to knee problems, having played with support strapping throughout his Paris campaign. Nadal leads Federer 16-8 and has won all three of their French Open final encounters plus a semi in 2005. He earlier celebrated his 25th birthday as he extended his career record at Roland Garros to 44-1 after beating Murray in three hours and 17 minutes. The Spaniard, beaten by Djokovic in clay finals at Madrid and Barcelona, is now one match away from equaling Bjorn Borg's record of six titles in Paris. On Sunday he will seek to become just the seventh player to win 10 grand slam titles. ""I have a lot of respect for the great Bjorn, but I am focused on trying to play well,"" the defending champion told the WTA Tour website. ""For me, is much more important [to] win Roland Garros than equal Bjorn."" Murray, who lost to Djokovic in January's Australian Open title match, failed in his bid to become the first British male to reach the final since Henry Austin in 1937. ""I thought I did well. Everyone seems to think it's easy against Rafa to just come into the net or come in or go for big shots, but you do have to be very patient,"" he said after dropping to 4-11 against Nadal. ""Sometimes I didn't quite get the ball I was looking for, and sometimes when I did I made a few mistakes. But I think it was a close match. I don't think there was too much in it. He just played better than me today. ""Going into the grass (season) I have to take positives from that, but I also need to look at things that I need to work on, not only for the grass-court season but beyond that as well. So I look forward to getting back on the practice court.""","Former world No. 1 Roger Federer beats Novak Djokovic in French Open semifinals .

"(CNN) -- Six-time World Series winners and one of Major League Baseball's (MLB) most successful franchises, the Los Angeles Dodgers, filed for bankruptcy in an American court on Monday . The move comes after the MLB -- who took charge of the team in April to ensure they ""will be guided appropriately in the future"" -- rejected a television rights deal last week which would have provided them with a much-needed financial boost. MLB commissioner Bud Selig turned down the proposed $3 billion agreement with the FOX network, citing it was not in the ""best interest of the fans, the teams or the game."" The bankrupty application is the latest chapter in a long-running story of financial difficulties for the Dodgers, a saga that has had the divorce battle between team co-owners Frank and Jamie McCourt as a back drop. The MLB appointed representatives to take care of the day-to-day running of the Dodgers in April due to the ongoing fall out between the owners and with the team suffering a drop in attendances at its Dodger Stadium. ""The Dodgers have been one of the most prestigious franchises in all of sports, and we owe it to their legion of loyal fans to ensure that this club is being operated properly,"" Selig said. Frank McCourt, who purchased a controlling stake in the team in 2004, has agreed in principle a $150m loan with hedge fund J.P. Morgan Chase to meet running costs. A judge will hold a hearing on Tuesday to decide whether or not to approve the loan, with $40m of the money set to be used to fulfil the Dodgers' payroll commitments, and McCourt will also request permission to hold an auction for the broadcasting rights. ""The commissioner's office has spent the better part of one year working with Mr. McCourt and his representatives on the financial situation of the Los Angeles Dodgers,"" read a statement from Selig on the Dodgers' official web site. ""[The financial problem] was caused by Mr. McCourt's excessive debt and his diversion of club assets for his own personal needs. Any potential solution to his problems that contemplates mortgaging the future of the Dodgers franchise to the long-term detriment of the club, its fans and the game of baseball would not be acceptable.""

"(CNN) -- Hundred's of fans and former teammates of Robert Enke gathered to lay flowers and light candles outside of Hannover 96's Niedersachsen Stadion after the club's German goalkeeper was struck and killed by a train on Tuesday, in what police called an apparent suicide. Enke, 32, died around 6:25 p.m. (12:25 p.m. ET), Hannover police press officer Stefan Wittke said in a statement. ""Preliminary police investigations indicate a suicide,"" Wittke said. Police did not elaborate on what evidence they had that pointed to suicide, but Enke's close friend and advisor Jorg Neblung told the official Web site of football's world governing body FIFA: ""I can confirm that it was suicide. Robert took his own life shortly before six o'clock."" The team's official Web site has been converted into a single-page memorial. Enke captained Hannover 96, a team who currently lie tenth in Germany's Bundesliga top division,  and had been capped by his national side eight times after making his debut aged 29. The shot-stopper had also appeared for teams including Carl Zeiss Jena, Borussia Monchengladbach, Benfica, Barcelona, Fenerbahce and Tenerife in Spain. His teammates were stunned by news of his death. ""We are in a state of shock,"" said team manager Oliver Bierhoff in a statement from the German Football Federation. ""It is beyond words."" The German Football Federation (DFB) said Enke always said he wanted to play for the national team at the 2010 World Cup. Soccer commentator and journalist Rafael Honigstein told CNN International that Enke was on course to be picked as the number-one choice for the team. Enke had missed Germany's last four matches because of a bacterial infection, but had recently returned to action with Hannover. ""The leadership of the German national team never had any doubt that he was important for the team both as a goalkeeper and as a human being,"" the DFB statement said. Enke is survived by his wife and eight-month-old daughter, who the couple adopted. The couple's two-year-old daughter died in 2006 from a heart condition, and Honigstein said the loss of his child had taken a toll on Enke. ""It's been well documented that he had a tough time,"" Honigstein said. ""People knew it was a terrible, terrible tragedy for him."" ""I don't know why and how this happened,"" said Martin Kind, the chairman of Hannover 96. ""It is a total catastrophe. I am finding it hard to understand. All I can say for sure is that it had nothing to do with football."" Fellow players said they believed that Enke had been suffering depression. ""He was unstable,"" said Mr Kind. ""But he kept it under wraps."" The coach of Germany's national team, Joachim Lowe, had been preparing his squad for their friendly game against Chile this weekend. The DFB have not yet confirmed whether the game would still be played. A press conference is due to be held by the DFB at 1130 GMT, while Hannover 96 will speak to the media at 1200 GMT on Wednesday. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","Germany international footballer Robert Enke has died at the age of 32 at a rail crossing .

"Rome (CNN) -- Saying it was ""shocked and alarmed"" after a Chinese man and infant were killed in a botched robbery in Rome, the Chinese Embassy urged Italian authorities to protect Chinese citizens in Italy. Zhou Zheng, 31, and his 9-month-old daughter were killed Wednesday, according to Italy's ANSA news agency. Two thieves demanded 5,000 euros (about $6,360) from his business's earnings as he was returning home with his family, according to the report. A bullet passed through the baby's head and struck Zhou in the heart, autopsy results said, according to ANSA. The Chinese Embassy in Rome issued a statement saying it was ""shocked and alarmed for the tragedy in Rome, and it firmly condemns the killers for their atrocity and inhumane violence."" The embassy asked Italian authorities to ""apply all the necessary measures"" to find the killers and bring them to justice. ""We also ask that Italy takes all the necessary measures to guard the personal and patrimonial security of the Chinese citizens in Italy,"" the statement said. The killings come amid a wave of unrelated slayings in Rome, ANSA reported. ""Rome's patience and that of her citizens is finished,"" Mayor Gianni Alemanno said, according to the news agency. ""There are criminal beasts that are operating in our city that must be stopped at all costs."" About 130 new police officers were to arrive in Rome in Friday, authorities told ANSA.

"(CNN) -- ""You press the button, we do the rest."" So Kodak promised back in 1888 when founder George Eastman introduced the company's first camera. But that's the problem, isn't it? We don't need anybody to do ""the rest"" nowadays. We don't need film processing. We don't need film, for that matter. We don't even need the cameras. We can just pull out our phones and get a perfectly adequate snapshot -- one without the sharpness and detail of a good 35-millimeter image, perhaps, but we live in an age of ""good enough."" After all, those MP3 files on your iPhone are no match for CD quality, either. It's that age of convenience that Eastman helped usher in with his once-ubiquitous company. But now convenience and technology have taken their toll: On Thursday, the venerable Rochester, New York-based firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. These days, its most coveted assets are its patents for digital imaging -- including, ironically, some used in smartphones. ""It made photography commonplace, from the Brownie (camera) through its many variations,"" says Joan Saab, who teaches visual and cultural studies at the University of Rochester. The ""democratization"" of photography even helped turn the form into art, as experts sought to bracket off the snapshots of everyday amateurs from the aspiring work of aficionados, she adds. CNNPhotos: Kodachrome collection looks back at midcentury America . Kodak was a pioneer in other ways. It was a relentless advertiser, promoting its products in a range of ways, making ""Kodak"" a synonym for photography. Eastman ""was marketing a product and a process. That was his genius,"" says Saab. ""It was bigger than just saying, 'Hey, buy my brand.' It was 'invest in this way of doing things.' "" Kodak's advertising deliberately tapped into a powerful vein of nostalgia, a concept that became as ingrained as the silver-halide crystals that form the photographic image. Kodak shrewdly exploited that feeling with its ad campaigns, which used songs such as the Paul Anka-sung ""The Times of Your Life"" to yank consumers' heartstrings. An episode of ""Mad Men"" paid homage to Kodak's power, as '60s adman Don Draper pumped up the company's Carousel slide projector by pointing out, ""This device isn't a spaceship. It's a time machine."" A forward-looking firm . Unfortunately for Kodak, nostalgia does not boost stock prices. Companies aren't forever, even ones that people think of fondly. Pan Am used to define the Jet Age; now the name refers to a struggling TV series that wishes to invoke the Jet Age. Woolworth was once a common presence on America's Main Streets; now it has been superseded by Target and Walmart, and its only remnant is the footwear store a subsidiary created in 1974: Foot Locker. And Kodak? Paul Simon wrote a song, ""Kodachrome,"" using film's rich colors as a metaphor for memory -- nostalgia, again. iReport: Kodak moments remembered . By the 1970s, Kodak was responsible for 90% of film and 85% of camera sales in the United States, according to The Economist. But for almost a generation, the company strained to keep up in a rapidly evolving tech market that's a step removed from the chemicals-and-paper space it dominated. Instead of Fuji and Polaroid (another firm that has been trying to reinvent itself), its rivals became Hewlett-Packard and Sony and Apple. Despite its tech know-how, Kodak wasn't quite nimble enough to keep up. Its executives ""suffered from a mentality of perfect products, rather than the high-tech mindset of make it, launch it, fix it,"" Harvard Business School's Rosabeth Moss Kanter told The Economist. Still, as the company seeks to reorganize, it's worth remembering how much of a forward-looking firm Kodak was. Eastman, a former insurance company messenger boy and bank clerk, was inspired to go into the business after a trip to the Dominican Republic. As his biography on the Kodak website observes, ""The camera was as big as a microwave oven and needed a heavy tripod. ... There were chemicals, glass tanks, a heavy plate holder, and a jug of water. The complete outfit 'was a pack-horse load,' as (Eastman) described it."" Photography was ripe for change. It wasn't a mass business yet, as Alexis Madrigal writes in an excellent Atlantic essay about ""the triumph of Kodakery."" When the first Kodak camera was introduced, the average middle-class family may have owned 10 photographs -- total. Photography was a craft generally handled by professionals who knew how to deal with those giant cameras, fragile glass plates, careful exposure times and dangerous chemicals. Eastman changed all that. He made photography casual: the early Kodak cameras -- which cost $25, a sizable sum at the time -- were loaded with 100 exposures, and the later Brownie, which cost $1, allowed for easy reloading. He anticipated the growth of leisure time, and made his product central to its use. ""Snapshots were a kind of social media: They were designed to be shared in once-ubiquitous albums of yesteryear,"" Madrigal writes. Years later, the vacation slide show, an excuse for gathering the neighbors to witness your trip to Disneyland, became the butt of jokes for the same reason. Eastman was also a benevolent mogul, giving his employees medical care, paying them good wages and supporting high culture in his western New York community. His name is all over the area, on such institutions as the Eastman Theatre, Eastman School of Music and Eastman House, the latter a photography museum. The digital present . Almost 3,000 miles away, there's another monument to Kodak: Hollywood's Kodak Theatre, home of the Academy Awards. But even in the movie capital, the use of film is in decline. Movie houses are changing over to digital projection, and even big-name directors such as David Fincher and Michael Mann have shot their features in high-definition digital formats. Amateurs, of course, have been indulging in digital for years. Processing film takes money and -- perhaps more importantly -- time. Now everything can be transferred from a camera to a computer as quickly as popping in a USB drive. Anticipation is as long gone from the process as Fotomat booths. ""My kids' relationship to photography is completely different,"" says Saab. ""They think you take pictures with a phone."" And prints? Almost never. Indeed, there's an impermanence to it all now. As one commenter to the Atlantic story pointed out, ""The pictures last, even if the cameras didn't: I have family photographs from the 19th century. I (wonder) if, in 100 years, people will have the digital images from the late 20th? 'Oh, yeah, they were on that computer that died and we never got the files off of it.' "" Still, Kodak's not dead yet. There's the intellectual property, for starters; analysts believe the patents may be worth $3 billion, according to Bloomberg, more than the company itself. There's the name, which is instantly recognizable. And there are the people: Even though the company has cut thousands of jobs, much of its generally well-educated workforce has stayed in the area, many starting tech-related businesses. Psychologically, Rochester is taking the company's bankruptcy pretty hard, says Saab, but the community is also hopeful. An editorial in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle suggests that the city's economic climate is improving, and Saab points out that ""we never had a real-estate bubble, so it never burst."" But it's difficult, she adds, not to feel sad about the bankruptcy of a legendary name. ""It feels like it marks the end of a major era, even though it's easier to take photos now. The idea of democratization is everywhere,"" she says. ""But this bankruptcy strikes a nerve for a lot of people. It's farewell to a certain version of the past, and with that is this idea of nostalgia and what Kodak so successfully sold to the American public.""","Kodak, longtime photography giant, filed for bankruptcy Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Luke Donald's hopes of defending his Madrid Masters title were dented in Saturday's third round as the world No. 1 bogeyed three of his last five holes. The Race To Dubai leader was left six shots behind world No. 328 Lee Slattery, who held a two-stroke lead as he seeks his first European Tour title. Donald, hoping to become the first golfer to top both the European and U.S. PGA Tour money lists in the same season, made a solid start in Spain with four birdies in his first 11 holes, including one from the bunker at the fifth. But he closed with a bogey to sign for two-under 70 to be tied for 10th on 208. Slattery, 136th in the money list, showed his fellow Englishman the way as he doubled his halfway lead with a flawless 69 that boosted his hopes of retaining his tour card. ""It's all about not thinking about the big picture,"" the 33-year-old told the European Tour website. ""It's very hard to do -- if you say don't think about a pink elephant you automatically think of that, but there are techniques you can use to switch off."" Australia's Brett Rumford is in the hunt for a fourth European Tour title after a 68 left him tied for second with Italy's Lorenzo Gagli, who shot 69. Gagli's compatriot and Ryder Cup winner Francesco Molinari dropped to a tie for fourth after a three-bogey 71 left him on 205 with Sweden's Oscar Floren and Argentina's Cesar Monasterio, who both signed for 67s. Donald's main rival in the European money race is U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy, who is playing at the Korea Open this week. The Northern Irishman started the third round in a five-way tie for the lead but fell 10 shots off the pace after a 73 on Saturday. American Rickie Fowler led by four shots from fellow PGA Tour star Y.E. Yang after equaling the course record at Woo Jeong Hills Country Club in Cheonan with an eight-under 63. Yang, who won his home tournament in 2006, shot 67 to be two clear of third-placed compatriot Meen-Whee Kim (66).","World No. 1 Luke Donald six shots off the pace at the Madrid Masters .

"(CNN) -- Forbes magazine has announced its inaugural list of Africa's top 40 richest people, highlighting Nigerian magnate Aliko Dangote as the continent's richest man. Forbes said its decision to launch the 40 Richest People in Africa is a ""testament to the growing global importance of the continent."" ""Fortunes are being created everywhere from South Africa clear north to Morocco and Egypt in a diverse array of industries,"" the magazine reported. Nigeria's Aliko Dangote made his fortune, estimated at $10.1 billion, at Dangote-Cement Plc, a construction company with a strong presence in Africa.

"University Park, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The funeral procession carrying the remains of former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno traveled Wednesday past Beaver Stadium, where he paced the sidelines for more than five decades. People along the procession, some dressed in Penn State colors, shouted out, ""We love you, Joe! You are Penn State."" Others held signs or stood in silence. A second public viewing was held earlier at the campus spiritual center before the private funeral and burial service in downtown State College. Paterno's blue hearse was accompanied by several vehicles carrying family members and others. Tuesday, some mourners dabbed their eyes; others made the sign of the cross as they walked past the closed casket that was covered with roses. A black-and-white photograph of a smiling Paterno rested nearby. Paterno died Sunday at the age of 85. A public memorial service is scheduled for Thursday at Bryce Jordan Center on the Penn State campus. All tickets for the event had been distributed by Tuesday morning, the university said on its Facebook page. The legendary coach's career with the Nittany Lions abruptly ended last fall amid criticism of his response to alleged child sexual abuse by a former assistant. A university spokeswoman said Tuesday that administrators have heard about a petition drive seeking to add Paterno's name to the football stadium, but it is too soon to discuss such initiatives. ""There are discussions that will be ongoing, but at this particular juncture, we are focused on the services on campus,"" she said. ""There will be future discussions about a variety of ideas."" Flags were flying at half-staff in Paterno's honor, and President Barack Obama phoned the family Monday to offer his condolences. ""It was very meaningful to my mother and very moving, and it was awfully nice of the president to call us,"" Paterno's son, Jay, said Tuesday. He and his sister, Mary Kay Paterno Hort, didn't directly address criticisms of their father for how he handled a 2002 report that an assistant coach had allegedly caught former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky molesting a young boy in a shower at the football complex on campus. Joe Paterno passed the report on to two university executives, who were later accused by authorities of misleading investigators and failing to properly report the abuse. In his final interview with The Washington Post, Paterno said he felt inadequate to deal with the situation. In Paterno's 46-season tenure as head coach, the Nittany Lions won two national championships, went undefeated five times and finished in the top 25 national rankings 35 times, according to his official Penn State biography. Paterno worked 61 years at the school. He became the winningest coach in major college football history on October 29, just days before the Sandusky case became public. The school fired him November 9. CNN's Sarah Hoye, Julian Cummings, Susan Candiotti and Laura Batchelor, and contributor Sara Ganim contributed to this report.","Crowds line streets for funeral procession .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Former International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch has died of a cardiac arrest at the age of 89. He was with his family when he died, a spokesman at the Hospital Quiron Barcelona told CNN. Samaranch was admitted to the hospital suffering from a serious heart condition, the hospital said on Tuesday. Samaranch, a Spaniard, was made an honorary life president of the IOC after stepping down from his position in 2001. During his tenure, Samaranch was credited with achieving financial security for the Olympic movement by maximizing television and sponsorship deals. He had served in the post for 21 years, making him the longest-serving IOC president. Current IOC President Jacques Rogge took over after Samaranch stepped down. ""I cannot find the words to express the distress of the Olympic family,"" Rogge said in a statement after his death. ""I am personally deeply saddened by the death of the man who built up the Olympic Games of the modern era, a man who inspired me, and whose knowledge of sport was truly exceptional. ""Thanks to his extraordinary vision and talent, Samaranch was the architect of a strong and unified Olympic movement. I can only pay tribute to his tremendous achievements and legacy, and praise his genuine devotion to the Olympic movement and its values. ""We have lost a great man, a mentor and a friend who dedicated his long and fulfilled life to Olympism."" Ed Hula, editor of the Olympics Web site Around the Rings, who knew and interviewed Samaranch, said he was responsible for modernizing the IOC and bringing about fundamental changes. ""He really brought the Olympics from the 20th into the 21st century by encouraging the growth in marketing revenue, TV sponsorship, that underpins the Olympic movement today,"" Hula told CNN. ""He took steps to end the culture of bribery and vote-buying that went on with the selection of Olympic cities. ""Some say he turned a blind eye to it for a long time until he was forced to act, but when he did act, the IOC didn't shy away from punishing and sanctioning those who were involved,"" Hula said. ""He was old world, an old-school IOC member, but at the same time he recognized the need for the IOC to become a much more modern organization."" He remained active in sports administration after stepping down as IOC president. He was hospitalized twice in recent years; in Lausanne, Switzerland in July 2001, shortly after stepping down from his position, and in Barcelona in 2007.","Juan Antonio Samaranch, 89, dies after suffering a cardiac arrest .

"(CNN) -- German Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich have confirmed that Jupp Heynckes will return as coach for a third time from next season. The 65-year-old Heynckes was widely expected to take over from Louis van Gaal after recently confirming that he was leaving Bayer Leverkusen at the end of this season, but Bayern made the news official on Friday. Confirming that Heynckes will take charge of Bayern from July 1, chairman Karl -Heinz Rummenigge told their official website: ""Jupp Heynckes was the candidate we wanted. ""We are delighted we've reached agreement with him on a two-year contract. I'm convinced our partnership with Jupp Heynckes will be a successful one."" Heynckes, who has led Leverkusen to second place in the Bundesliga this season, added: ""Quite apart from my excellent personal relations with the senior officials at Bayern, I have always been exceptionally impressed by the utterly professional way in which the club is managed. ""I have already coached Bayern twice, and always valued the working atmosphere and climate there. ""Obviously, as Bayern coach, you have a certain duty to deliver success. However, I regard that as an appealing challenge, which I am delighted to tackle together with the team over the next two seasons."" Heynckes has 32 years of coaching experience, taking his first job at Moenchengladbach in 1979. He led Bayern to two league titles in his first spell at the club between 1987 and 1991 and also briefly replaced Jurgen Klinsmann in 2009. Schalke and Eintracht Frankfurt have also been coached by Heynckes in his home country, while he has also been in charge of Real Madrid, Benfica, Tenerife and Athletic Bilbao (twice).","Jupp Heynckes is confirmed as Bayern Munich's new coach from July 1 .

"(CNN) -- A University of Wisconsin senior official resigned after making unwanted sexual advances to a male student employee of the school's athletic department, according to a report released this week. John Chadima resigned his post as senior associate athletic director at UW-Madison earlier in January after the allegations surfaced. The allegations were investigated by an independent panel and the report was released Tuesday night. The report alleges that Chadima made the advance in late December at a Rose Bowl party that he was throwing at a hotel in Los Angeles. There was beer and mixed drinks at that party and about 25 to 30 people attended, including employees that were under the age of 21, the report said. As the party was ending, Chadima asked one student to stay behind and have a drink with him. The two each had three rum drinks. The report called the student, who is over the age of 21, John Doe. ""Chadima told John Doe that he thought that Doe might be gay,"" the report says. ""Chadima reached over and removed Doe's pants belt and then inserted his hand inside Doe's pants on his genitals."" The student slapped Chadima's hand away and swore at him, the report says. ""What are you going to do about it? I could have you fired,"" Chadima said according to the report. As the student rushed from the room, Chadima said he had been joking. The student told his immediate supervisor, along with other student employees and the police were alerted. Chadima declined to be interviewed for the investigation but did release a statement that was released with the report. ""I make no excuses and accept full responsibility for my actions,"" the statement said. ""I deeply regret leaving under these circumstances and disappointing those people with, and for whom I have worked and dedicated my career for the past 22 years.""","John Chadima resigned after the allegations surfaced .

"(CNN) -- As President Barack Obama was about to deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday, his prospective Republican challengers were busy laying the groundwork for their efforts to challenge the incumbent. Three of the four Republican candidates held events in Florida on Tuesday, a week before the state's crucial primary. While focusing criticism on Obama to try to dim the president's limelight, the candidates also managed to get in some shots at each other in the aftermath of a spirited debate Monday night. ""The president will do what he does best. He'll give a nice speech, a lot of memorable phrases in it, but he won't give you the hard numbers like 9.9% unemployment here in Florida,"" former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney predicted at a campaign event in Tampa. ""... Instead, tonight President Obama will make the opening argument for his campaign against a do-nothing Congress."" Romney spoke at an abandoned factory, in front of an American flag and a banner that read, ""Obama isn't working."" He later spoke in front of a foreclosed Florida home to emphasize the economic hardships facing many Americans. ""Today, too many factory floors are silent, warehouses are deserted, corporate offices are empty and real estate endeavors are abandoned,"" Romney said. ""Floridians are struggling to find a job, keep a home and raise a family. This is the real state of our union, but you won't hear stories like those at President Obama's address tonight. The unemployed don't get tickets to sit next to the first lady."" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose poll numbers have surged in the wake of his primary victory on Saturday in South Carolina, said at an event in St. Petersburg that change must occur at the White House, in Congress and in the bureaucracy of Washington. ""It's bigger than Obama,"" Gingrich said. ""While he's the start, there's much more to getting this country back on track than Obama."" Later, in Sarasota, Gingrich said that, if elected president, his first acts would be to sign executive orders undoing policies of the Obama administration. ""By the time President Obama lands in Chicago, we will have dismantled about 40% of his administration,"" Gingrich said to cheers. His strongest barbs, however, were aimed at Romney, the early front-runner in Florida who has seen Gingrich close the gap in recent days in polls. Romney leveled attacks against Gingrich during Monday's debate, the first of two this week before Floridians vote in their January 31 primary. A different candidate has won each of the first three nominating contests so far, but Romney's strong organization and war chest are considered an advantage as the primary process proceeds. ""Look, I need your help between now and next Tuesday,"" Gingrich told his supporters, referring to the primary date. ""The fact is, Gov. Romney will have vastly more money than I will, but we will have many more people than he will. This is exactly what happened in South Carolina, and people power beats money power every time."" Still, Gingrich's campaign finances were improving: A super PAC backing Gingrich, Winning Our Future, bought $6 million in ads in Florida, a spokesman for the group, Rick Tyler, told CNN. The buy came one day after major Republican donor Miriam Adelson contributed $5 million to the organization. Also Tuesday, Romney's 2010 tax return and an estimate of his tax liability for 2011 underwent scrutiny. The documents reveal he made $42.7 million over the past two years and paid $6.2 million in taxes, with an effective federal income tax rate of just under 14%. At an event in Stuart, Florida, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum contrasted his finances with those of his rivals at an event in Stuart, Florida. ""When you see my tax return, you will note that I do not have the riches of others in this race,"" said Santorum, who is vying with Gingrich to become the favored conservative candidate of the primary campaign against the more moderate Romney. Santorum preemptively criticized Obama's speech by blaming the president for increasing the size of the government, increasing deficits and debt, and seeing the U.S. credit rating downgraded on his watch. Santorum, citing Obama's legislation on health care and Wall Street, called him ""the worst president this country has ever seen."" ""You are going to hear a bunch of flowery rhetoric and all this stuff about all the things he has done,"" Santorum said. ""But what he has done -- he has grown the tax burden on the American public through Obamacare, through Dodd-Frank and through other bills."" Santorum also leveled criticism at Romney and Gingrich in a fundraising letter that repeated his debate attack Monday night that accused both of his rival candidates of having betrayed conservative principles on major issues such as health care and global warming. ""On the big issues, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney are not all that different from Obama,"" the letter said. In Punta Gorda, Santorum dismissed reports of growing income inequality in the nation. ""Income inequality is going to happen, some people are going to make more, some people are going to make less,"" Santorum said. ""People ask me, 'What do you think about Mitt Romney, you know, making a gazillion dollars last year?' Good for him, that's what I say, good for him. I wish I'd made some gazillion dollars last year. I'd be in a little better shape financing my own campaign like he's done. Good for him, that's OK. The problem is, and this is something Republicans and conservatives need to be concerned about, is the ability of people to rise. The ability of people to climb the ladder."" In an interview with CNN, Gingrich cited his appearance in an advertisement about climate change with a Democratic former speaker. ""The dumbest thing I've done in the last four years was sit on a couch with Nancy Pelosi,"" he said. Pelosi pushed back sharply. ""I think he's done plenty of dumb things and there's stiff competition for what is the dumbest thing he's done, of course, including his violations of the ethics rules of the House of Representatives,"" she told CNN. Pelosi needed no polls in making her prediction about the outcome of the race. ""He's not going to be president of the United States,"" she said. ""That's not going to happen."" Texas Rep. Ron Paul has decided not to spend money in Florida because of his poor prospects in the winner-take-all primary. Instead, he is focusing on upcoming caucuses in Nevada, Colorado and Minnesota in a bid to win more delegates so he can wield influence at the Republican convention in August. Florida is a key battleground and offers a different campaign landscape. The number of Florida Republican voters exceeds the combined total in the previous three states, requiring a larger campaign organization and more money for advertising. Romney got a head start in the state over his rivals and is expected to receive a boost from the early voting that the state permits. According to the state, at least 53,000 ballots had been cast in early voting that started on Saturday. Of the 475,000 people who requested and were sent absentee ballots, 180,000 had been filled out and sent back by last Wednesday. Those absentee votes came in before Gingrich rose in the polls and won South Carolina's primary by a double-digit margin. In 2008, nearly 1.95 million people voted in Florida's GOP primary. According to Gallup's daily tracking poll, Gingrich is in a statistical tie with Romney nationally among registered Republicans. The national poll showed Romney at 29% and Gingrich at 28%. After the New Hampshire primary this month, Romney was at 37% and Gingrich at 14% in the same poll. Monday's poll results showed Paul at 13% and Santorum at 11%. The sampling error was plus-or-minus 3 points. CNN's Jim Acosta, Rachel Streitfeld, Tom Cohen and Adam Aigner-Treworgy contributed to this report.","Rick Santorum calls Barack Obama ""the worst president this country has ever seen""

"(CNN) -- Gabrielle Giffords submitted her resignation as a U.S. representative from Arizona before Congress on Wednesday, and an initial reaction might be a sense of despair about her decision to step aside. Many have imposed a narrative of national recovery on Giffords' ability to run for her office again and take her oath in a clear strong voice. But in this case, it would be a mistake to confuse holding public office with redemption. A congressional seat is not supposed to be a plot point for Hollywood endings, and by passing up the chance to run again, Giffords has demonstrated a respect for the principles of representative democracy. The authors of the Constitution intended Congress to be a rotating body, free from the cults of personality and lifetime sinecures that characterized European governance. Although it is human nature to see a kind of triumph in being able to come back to one's job after an injury, Giffords understands that the office belonged not to her but to southern Arizona. She made the decision after a year of rehabilitation, and she deserved that time to make a hard call with the best evidence. Her choice this week recalls an old observation of Harry Truman, who said he always tried to remember that the crowds cheering and the bands playing ""Hail to the Chief"" were not for him personally. They were for the office of the presidency. The office of Congress may also be too small for Giffords. This is a body that commands the respect of 8% of the electorate: a record low. And despite the illusion of glamour that surrounds it, the actual work can be physically taxing and spiritually dreary. Traveling back and forth from Washington each week, visiting the House floor multiple times a day for procedural votes, sweet-talking big donors, finding positions that will please the district without making you feel like a sellout -- all of these can take their toll. After her bruising re-election fight of 2010 -- one of the nastiest races in recent local memory, with an eerie pallor of violence hanging over it -- Giffords herself doubted whether she wanted the job much longer. She now has a golden opportunity to start a ""Gabrielle Giffords Institute"" for the study of gun violence or mental health care reform or solar energy or whatever public policy issue she wants to emphasize. Her moral authority and influence may be better used outside the halls of Congress, where she would have been inevitably fettered by the daily grind of politics and partisanship. In her video announcement, she said: ""I will return, and we will work together for Arizona and this great country."" And we should take her at her word, even if that doesn't mean a return to elective office. To be sure, this is not the future anyone would have wanted. There is enormous cruelty in her injury -- the robbery of her ability to speak -- which was one of her truly exceptional qualities. I remember thinking near the end of her first campaign for Congress, in 2006, that the only thing that could deny her a victory over her maladroit opponent would be some kind of epic goof made during a campaign rally or a debate -- a vague exclamation taken out of context or a damaging statement made in passion. But such a possibility was remote. ""Gabrielle doesn't really make mistakes,"" I told a friend. She possessed a preternaturally strong sense of control over her words. This was also true in private conversation. Giffords had that quality, cherished among leaders, to gauge the emotional temperature of the person she was with and adjust her own bearing accordingly. There were many times in our friendship when she managed to say the unexpectedly perfect thing in the moment: a key piece of advice, a joke, an anecdote that had precise relevance. There is a picture of her that is difficult for me to view. It is the last photograph of her taken before the 16 seconds of gunfire that would change everything. She is standing in front of the Safeway on January 8, 2011, looking intently at a middle-aged woman named Doris Tucker, who had been next in line to speak with her . In back of her is the plate-glass front of the grocery store on which the smeary reflections of a few people are visible. Out of this crowd a gunman was about to emerge. But what dominates the frame is Giffords' expression, one of wordless concentration and interest in what Tucker was saying. It was a look that I knew well. The loss of her ability to find the words in conversation easily is an awful blow. But the Giffords I know won't surrender the primary motivating force in her life, which is the urge to make a difference in the public sphere and to use her talents to make life better for those around her. That was what motivated her first run for Congress five years ago. She is leaving national elective office in the same way she came in: with class and dignity. It would be a mistake to think of this as a defeat because it is not the neat Hollywood ending we had hoped for. This is not Hollywood. And this is not an ending. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- German medical groups joined the French health ministry Friday in recommending that women seek removal of breast implants made by a French company, saying they need not hurry but the devices could pose eventual health problems. England's National Health Service also weighed in Friday, stopping short of recommending routine removal of implants made by Poly Implant Prostheses, or PIP, but agreeing to pay to have them taken out in some cases. French authorities announced last month that the government would pay for the removal of the bankrupt company's implants, which a British medical group says were made from ""non-medical grade silicone believed by the manufacturers to be made for mattresses."" Authorities in France and England have dismissed fears of cancer from the implants, but have said the devices are prone to rupture and could cause inflammation, scarring and fibrosis. More than 500 French women have had the implants removed since last year, according to the French government agency that evaluates the safety of medical products. Since then, more than 1,000 implants have ruptured, the agency said. German medical groups representing plastic surgeons, breast care specialists and gynecologists said Friday that while the implants do not pose any immediate health threat, they raise the risk of ruptures, difficulties with breast imaging and other complications. ""We recommend removal without hurry, just as the French expert commission has recommended,"" the groups said in a joint release. In Britain, David Nicholson, chief executive of the National Health Service, said an advisory medical group found there was no evidence to support routine removal of the implants or suggestions that they could increase the risk of cancer. ""However, the group also acknowledges that many of the implants are made up of non-medical grade silicone and should not have been implanted in women in the first place,"" Nicholson said in a letter to medical workers released Friday. Nicholson said the government would pay to have the implants removed from women who received them as part of reconstructive care provided by the publicly funded National Health Service. Women who paid for cosmetic implants from private clinics would not be eligible for government funded care in most cases, the NHS said. But Nicholson said he hoped private practitioners would also pay for the removal of implants if patients request it. ""We want the private sector to offer the same service to its patients as the NHS is offering and we are working with them to best ensure an equivalent model of care is provided,"" he said. An estimated 300,000 women in 65 countries received breast implants from the company. The implants were banned in 2010 and the company went bankrupt later that year. The implants are not approved for use in the United States. CNN's Diana Magnay and Stefan Simons contributed to this report.","German medical groups back the removal of breast implants made by a French company .

"(WIRED) -- Gadget fans may be focused on the CES trade show this week, but there's something else notable going on today: It's the iPhone's fifth birthday. Five years ago today, Apple unveiled the original iPhone to the world. It wasn't a tightly kept secret, shrouded in mystery and speculation like more recent Apple announcements, but it was arguably the world's most anticipated gadget launch. Although its form factor -- a capacitive touchscreen candy bar -- hasn't dramatically changed over the years, each iteration of the iPhone has yielded important improvements. Let's take a look back at how the iPhone revolutionized what we thought a phone could be. The iPhone Is Revealed . ""An iPod, a phone, an internet mobile communicator,"" Jobs said when preparing to introduce the iPhone in January 2007. ""An iPod, a phone, an internet mobile communicator.... These are not three separate devices!"" The original iPhone launched on AT&T with a handful of Apple-created apps. It had a 320Ã—480 resolution, 3.5-inch capacitive touchscreen and 2-megapixel camera, and ran iOS 1.0. Inside, it featured a 412MHz ARM 11 processor, a proximity sensor, and an accelerometer. Priced at $499 and $599 for 4GB and 8GB models, the iPhone didn't actually go on sale to eager hordes of consumers (hundreds of whom waited outside Apple Stores) until June 29. ""As a device, it's a genre-bender,"" former Gadget Lab editor Dylan Tweney said in his review of the landmark device. ""Never before have American consumers had access to a phone that is simultaneously so powerful, so elegant, and that performs so many functions."" iPhone 3G, the App Store and iOS 2.0 . Apple's second generation iPhone debuted in the summer of 2008. Internally, it was largely identical to its predecessor: same processor, same type of display, same 2.0 megapixel camera, same amount of memory. But the iPhone 3G, as the name implied, now supported 3G network operability, as well as GPS. More importantly, though, the launch of the 3G was accompanied by iOS version 2.0, which included an industry-altering addition: the App Store. The App Store finally let independent, third-party developers legally create apps for the device with a 70/30 revenue split weighted toward Apple. The App Store has been an incredible success story for Apple and developers alike. It houses more than half-a-million apps, and there's been more than 18 billion downloads to date. Pretty much every mobile platform has its own app market now, and most are modeled similarly to Apple's. iPhone 3GS Takes Photography Seriously . The iPhone 3GS was primarily an incremental improvement over the 3G, but it included some notable hardware improvements that would continue through later iterations of the phone. First, the 3GS included a camera upgrade: a 3-megapixel, autofocusing camera that shot decent video that could be edited and easily sent to YouTube or other destinations. Photography would become an increasingly important feature for iPhone users. The processor was upgraded to a 600MHz Samsung chip, and the display was upped to 480Ã—320 pixels. The 3GS also added a compass, a tool that would prove incredibly useful in apps like Google Maps. On the software side, the 3GS also added Voice Control, and iOS, now at version 3.0, finally added a cut/copy/paste functionality to the system. iPhone 4: Prototype Leak, 'Antennagate' and Verizon . The iPhone 4 stunned the world with its radically redesigned look, which Gizmodo revealed early after getting its hands on a prototype. A 3.5-inch Retina Display put pretty much every other smartphone display to shame: At 960Ã—640 and bearing a 326ppi pixel density, it offered pixels smaller than the human eye could detect. The iPhone 4 was also encased front and back by slim slabs of glass, and ringed by an aluminum rim. The visual conceit was slick, and Apple received kudos for its smart industrial design refresh. Unfortunately, that aluminum rim became the source of a debacle known as ""Antennagate"": Because of the external antenna design of the phone, if users held it a particular way, they would experience a drop in signal strength. The iPhone 4 debuted in June 2010, still on AT&T like its predecessors, but in January 2011, Apple expanded availability to Verizon. iPhone 4S Delivers Siri . Expecting an entirely differently designed iPhone 5, some Apple fans were disappointed by the announcement of merely an ""iPhone 4S."" However, pre-sale numbers and opening weekend sales numbers proved the 4S to be the most successful iPhone launch in Apple's history. A major reason for the success of the 4S was its new voice-controlled virtual assistant, Siri. Hackers attempting to port Siri to other iOS devices have almost succeeded, but the solution just isn't available for the masses. Others though, are more interested in hacking Siri to control other gadgets in their lives like thermostats or a rotary dial phone.

"Washington (CNN) -- More than 30 years after it was stolen from a French museum, an impressionist painting is on its way home. Camille Pissarro's ""Le Marche aux Poissons"" (""The Fish Market"" in English) was handed over to the French ambassador by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Wednesday. ""I love days like this because they are all about the triumph of right over wrong,"" said ICE Director John Morton before signing the document to return the art. The roughly greeting-card-size work was stolen from the Faure Museum in Aix-les-Bains in southeastern France in 1981. A museum guard told authorities she saw a man walk out with the work hidden under his jacket. The piece is a color monotype, a one-of-a-kind print made by painting on glass and then transferring the wet paint to a piece of paper. Pissarro painted 24 monotypes and only 12 of them were colored, according to the French ambassador, Francois Delattre. ""Today is a great day"" he said. ""This thriller has a happy ending"" This Pissarro was sold to a gallery in San Antonio, Texas, in 1985, where it was bought by a gallery employee, according to ICE investigators. In 2003, they said, she tried to sell it at a New York auction house, where it was expected to bring $60,000 to $80,000. It was recognized as stolen art and, after years of legal battling, was forfeited to ICE in November of 2011. Wednesday's return was staged in a hall of a Washington museum filled with other French impressionist works, including some by artists who were inspired by Pissarro. ""'Le Marche aux Poissons' will once again be seen by the public,"" Delattre said. He called its return ""a gift to all future visitors."" The customs bureau said that since 2007 it has returned more than 2,500 items to more than 22 countries. The man who authorities think walked out of the French museum with the Pissarro has never been prosecuted for the theft.","Camille Pissarro's ""Le Marche aux Poissons"" is given to the French ambassador .

"Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) -- A former Marine Corps reservist pleaded guilty Thursday to shooting at the Pentagon and other military-related buildings and to trying to desecrate graves at Arlington National Cemetery containing the remains of veterans who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yonathan Melaku entered a guilty plea to three counts: damaging U.S. property with a firearm, using a firearm in a crime of violence and attempting injury to veterans' memorials on U.S. property. Melaku, a 23-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Ethiopia, was arrested June 17 at the cemetery. He had a backpack with four plastic bags each containing 5 pounds of ammonium nitrate, material commonly used in homemade explosives. He also had numerous 9 mm spent shell casings; black paint and a notebook with Arabic statements mentioning al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, the Taliban and the ""Path to Jihad."" In the statement of facts document signed by Melaku, he admitted he ""intended to desecrate and injure grave markers by spray-painting the markers with Arabic statements and by leaving the ammonium nitrate he was carrying at the sites of these grave markers."" Melaku did not have all the components needed to make a bomb. In a search of his home, investigators found a typed list that included various components including batteries, wire and a ""digital kitchen countdown timer."" But he had not obtained all of those items. Melaku admitted to five shootings with a legally owned handgun at military buildings in Northern Virginia between October 17 and November 2 of 2010. He said he attacked the Pentagon, Marine and Coast Guard recruiting offices and he twice fired at the National Museum of the Marine Corps. The government released a video Melaku made showing his second attack at the Marine Corps museum in Quantico, Virginia, on October 29. Recorded Arabic music is heard in the background as Melaku drives down an interstate talking about his target. ""Last time I hit them, they turned off the lights,"" Melaku is heard saying. ""Punks! Now, here we go again. This time, I'm going to turn it off permanently."" Melaku then says, ""That's the target. That's the military building that's going to, gonna get attacked."" Melaku's face is shown on part of the video but he's also seen wearing a black hood as he prepares to shoot at the museum, although the building is not visible on the video. Shots ring out in rapid succession. Then Melaku excitedly yells, ""Allahu Akbar"" several times and also sings along with the recorded music playing in his car. According to court documents, the five military building shootings caused more than $100,000 in damage. Melaku, wearing a green jail jumpsuit on Thursday, spoke only to respond to questions from U.S. District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee. Asked how he was pleading to the three counts against him, Melaku replied, ""Guilty, sir."" After the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Dana Boente said Melaku indicated in the video he made at the Marine museum shooting that his intention was to ""create fear and terror, which is what terrorists do"" and that he wanted to shut down the building. Boente also said Melaku had ""a large amount of jihadist material on his computer."" FBI Supervisory Special Agent Jacqueline Maguire would not list which websites Melaku used, but said a search of the computer showed he was ""conducting research"" relating to the list of needed bomb components found at his home. U.S. officials have said Melaku has no ties to any terrorist groups and appears to have acted alone. Prior to the plea deal, Melaku faced the possibility of life in prison if convicted on all charges. But the plea agreement calls for him to serve 25 years followed by five years of supervised release. He will be sentenced on April 27. Melaku offered no explanation for his actions at Thursday's hearing. His defense lawyer, Gregory English, asked that his client receive a mental examination and suggested he might need treatment while in prison. English emphasized Melaku was competent and understood the legal proceedings, but said his parents were concerned he might have problems with anger management or post-traumatic stress. Judge Lee said it was an unusual request since no mental issues were raised before the guilty plea, but he said he would consider the matter. Melaku joined the Marine Reserves in August of 2007 but was never deployed overseas. At the time of his arrest in June last year, a military official told CNN that Melaku had failed a combat fitness test about a month before the first military building shooting. The official said he later did poorly on a physical and was listed as non-deployable.","Yonathan Melaku pleads guilty to charges including damaging U.S. property .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- In his answers to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge, the captain of the ill-fated cruise ship Costa Concordia admitted he made a ""mistake"" in colliding with rocks off the Italian island of Giglio. However, in statements made during a phone conversation with a friend earlier this month, Capt. Francesco Schettino said managers pressured him to steer the ship to the area where the collision occurred, two Italian newspapers reported Wednesday. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Schettino's behavior. He is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship when the vessel struck rocks and rolled over onto its side in the waters off the island on January 13. A 16th body was found Tuesday on the ship. Sixteen others are missing from the roughly 4,200 people aboard the cruise liner -- 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members -- at the time of the collision. ""I hit this projection of rock, that seems almost stuck into the ship, but this was my mistake,"" Schettino said in the 126-page transcript. ""... There isn't anything I can say, as I was convinced that passing within .28 of a mile there wouldn't be any problem. The captain also brushed aside suggestions that at 15 knots, he was going too fast, as alleged by prosecutors. ""There isn't a speed limit,"" he said. ""... We had more or less the speed needed to reach Savona on time."" According to the transcript, Schettino maintained he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking. ""This is what allowed me to limit the tilting,"" he said. Maritime lawyer Jim Allsworth told CNN the maneuver is ""fairly standard"" in the case of a ship taking on water and in danger of sinking or capsizing. ""The best thing to do is to put it aground to stop it sinking."" Italian newspapers La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera on Wednesday published excerpts from a telephone conversation Schettino had with a friend after his January 14 arrest. The captain called his friend from the prosecutor's office, and authorities tapped the phone, the newspapers said. Schettino attorney Alessandro Antichi confirmed the wiretap but would not comment on the conversation. The information should not have been published, he said, as it is part of the investigation. ""In my place, someone else wouldn't have been so benevolent to have gone right under there, because they have pissed me off, go, go there,"" Schettino said, in an apparent reference to getting close to the island, according to the newspapers. ""The shallows were there but it wasn't signaled by the instruments that I had and I went through ... in order to follow what the managers wanted."" The man behind the steering wheel, Jacob Rusli Bin, told investigators that after the ship struck the rocks, Schettino cursed and said he had not seen them, La Repubblica reported. Speaking Wednesday before the Italian Senate, Costa CEO Pier Luigi Foschi gave an account of what occurred as documented by Roberto Ferrarini, the company's director of marine operations. The first contact between Schettino and Ferrarini took place about 15 minutes after the collision, at 9:57 p.m. In the call, Schettino told Ferrarini of the crash and said the ship had lost power but assured him the ship could still navigate and the situation was being investigated. In subsequent calls, Foschi said, Schettino updated Ferrarini about the ship taking on water but insisted it could still navigate. Foschi told lawmakers that Ferrarini reported Schettino was calm during the calls. The last call in which the captain reported the situation was under control came in at 10:33 p.m., he said. Two minutes later, Schettino called to tell Ferrarini the ship was being evacuated, Foschi said, adding that Ferrarini was surprised at the sudden change. Ferrarini and Schettino continued to talk during the evacuation, Foschi said, but did not provide further details. Costa cannot conduct an independent investigation because prosecutors seized the ship's data recorder, or ""black box."" The recorder had some connection problems but is working, Foschi said. It contains conversation recordings and navigation system data, he said. Schettino's defense attorney, Bruno Leporatti, filed an appeal Wednesday of a judge's decision to place the captain on house arrest, Leporatti's office said in a statement. Both the prosecution and the defense are appealing the decision -- prosecutors because they believe Schettino should be in custody, and the defense because it believes he should have been released with no restrictions on his movements. In his deposition, Schettino defended his decision not to evacuate the ship immediately. ""It's not like I can have a black out and immediately say, 'Let's all get out of here,' "" he said. ""Where do I send these people? I need to have the certainty and reach my decision on the fact that the ship is like that (no longer capable of floating). I am not going to put at risk the lives of 4,000 people."" Cruise ship passengers described a scene of panic and confusion as they rushed for lifeboats. Some said the crew seemed overwhelmed and did not have accurate information on what was taking place. In the transcript, Schettino also described the chaos, saying he helped passengers onto lifeboats and that some became stuck because of the angle of the listing ship. He said he was trying to launch a lifeboat when he realized he was no longer on board. ""I was then on the lifeboat. It isn't as if I had boarded it,"" he said. ""Look, I fell on its roof."" However, in the wiretapped conversation, Schettino tells the friend, ""When I understood that the ship was tilting, I decided to leave, and left,"" according to Corriere della Sera. A captain's leaving the ship with passengers still aboard is difficult to defend, said Italian criminal defense attorney Ugo Meucci, who does not represent Schettino. ""This is a very difficult position because our law is very strong, and the risk is very high for the captain,"" who could face a 15-year jail sentence, Meucci said. Schettino has resolutely defended his actions after the ship hit the rocks, insisting he kept his bosses at Costa fully informed of the accident's severity. ""The gash (in the ship) was immense,"" the captain said in the wiretapped conversation. ""There was this projection of rock, and then all what I did afterwards, I did it with my most professionalism, and this can help me alleviate or at least give me the illusion to be at peace with my conscience."" He tells the friend. ""I'm proud of the fact that we saved almost all (the passengers). ... I went around picking up people at sea and I'm at peace."" Schettino also tells the friend, ""I don't ever want to go back on ship."" CNN's Hada Messia in Rome contributed to this report.","Captain told a friend managers pressured him to steer toward the island, newspapers say .

"(CNN) -- Tammy Faye Messner, the former televangelist and Christian singer who battled drug addiction and later inoperable cancer, died Friday morning, CNN's Larry King said Saturday night. He said the family had asked him to make the delayed announcement. She was 65. Messner was a guest on ""Larry King Live"" on Thursday. She told him she couldn't swallow food, and weighed only 65 pounds. King said the family postponed the death announcement for a day so family members could gather. Messner was cremated and interred in a remote part of Kansas at the Kansas-Oklahoma state line, King said. ""The family appreciates all of the well wishes of so many people,"" the talk show host said on CNN. ""She wanted a party,"" King added. ""They're going to schedule a party in two to three weeks in Palm Springs, California. Her friends will be invited. And she wanted it to be a celebration. ""She died peacefully. Anyone who saw her on our show this week knew that she didn't have long."" King asked her Thursday if she were ""a little scared."" She responded, ""A little bit,"" adding that she mainly worried about her family.  Watch Messner on King's show » . She made dramatic appearances on the now-defunct Christian PTL Network she started with then-husband Jim Bakker, its host. Before millions of viewers, she would often break into tears, prompting her trademark heavy mascara to run. ""Our family is deeply saddened by the news of the passing of Tammy Faye,"" Bakker said late Saturday. ""She lived her life like the song she sang, 'If Life Hands You a Lemon, Make Lemonade.' ""My heart aches for my two children, Jamie Charles and Tammy Sue, who loved their mother dearly. They both told me their mom was so full of life that it is hard to believe she is gone."" Bakker said Tammy Sue stayed with her mother almost around-the-clock in the last year to help care for her. ""Tammy Faye's deep faith in God has kept her throughout her life as well as during these last days of her life. In her last 48 hours, she shared her faith in Jesus Christ on worldwide television with millions of people."" After divorcing Bakker, who became steeped in money and sex scandals, she married Christian construction magnate and former PTL contractor Roe Messner in 1993. She was married to Bakker for more than 30 years. She underwent surgery for colon cancer in 1996. In 2004, she revealed that the disease had spread to her lungs, and in May 2007 she announced that her doctors had stopped trying to treat the illness. In her appearance on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Tammy Faye Messner was a shadow of her former self. ""I believe when I leave this Earth, because I love the Lord, I am going straight to heaven,"" she said. King said she had sought the interview. She told King she was bedridden most of the time, had trouble swallowing food -- hence the weight loss -- and was in near-constant pain. But her sense of humor was still intact. On her Web site, she wrote on Monday, ""I crave hamburgers and french fries with LOTS of ketchup! When I can eat that again, it will be a day of victory!"" Asked by King what she would most like to be remembered for, Messner replied, ""well, my eyelashes."" Messner wore heavy makeup -- her lip liner, eyeliner and eyebrows were tattooed on. Born Tammy Faye LaValley in International Falls, Minnesota, she married Bakker in 1961. From 1966 to 1973, the Bakkers co-hosted ""The 700 Club,"" on the Christian Broadcasting Network, founded by television evangelist and Christian Coalition founder the Rev. Pat Robertson. They began The PTL Club -- with the initials standing for ""Praise The Lord"" or ""People That Love"" -- in 1974 and later expanded it into a television network. At the height of its popularity, PTL was bringing in more than $128 million annually and was carried on 1,300 cable systems with 12 million subscribers. In 1978, the Heritage USA theme park opened at the network's headquarters in Fort Mill, South Carolina. The Heritage USA Grand Hotel was added in 1984 and a water park in 1986. That year, more than 6 million people visited the park, making it the nation's third most popular attraction after Walt Disney World and Disneyland. On March 19, 1987, Jim Bakker resigned from PTL in the face of a scandal involving an affair seven years earlier with Jessica Hahn, a secretary he paid to keep quiet. Hahn received a one-time $115,000 payment and monthly interest payments from a $150,000 trust fund. The following month, PTL filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Also in 1987, Tammy Faye Bakker was treated at the Betty Ford Center for prescription drug addiction. And in December 1988, Jim Bakker was indicted for fraud and conspiring to defraud churchgoers of $158 million. Tammy Faye Bakker was not named in the indictment. In 1989, Heritage USA and the Grand Hotel closed, and Jim Bakker was convicted of 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy and sentenced to 45 years in prison. Tammy Faye Bakker divorced him while he was incarcerated, and Jim Bakker was paroled in December 1994. Asked by King on Thursday what she would change in her life if she could, Tammy Faye Messner replied, ""I don't think about that, Larry, because that's just a waste of good brain space."" When King suggested that she might want to forget the PTL Club, she said, ""I have gotten over that, thank God. That was a terrible, horribly bad experience."" The Bakkers' 30-year-old son, Jay, is a pastor who co-founded the Revolution Church in Brooklyn, New York -- a church aimed at those who feel rejected by traditional approaches to Christianity, stating on the church's Web site that he wrestled with religion after seeing the ""excommunicative"" treatment his parents experienced from the church after the scandal. Tammy Faye Messner has also been known as one of the few evangelical Christians who had the support of the gay community. She was one of the first televangelists to reach out to those with AIDS when it was a little-known and much-feared disease. In return, she told King in July, ""When I went -- when we lost everything, it was the gay people that came to my rescue, and I will always love them for that."" She was able to bounce back after PTL folded. In 1996, she co-hosted the ""Jim J. and Tammy Faye Show"" with gay actor Jim J. Bullock. In 2000, a documentary based on her life, ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"" was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. And in 2003, she appeared on The WB network's reality show, ""The Surreal Life."" Over her life, Messner also recorded more than 25 albums and wrote several books. In 1996, she wrote her autobiography, ""Telling it My Way."" She also wrote ""Run to the Roar,"" a book about overcoming fear, and in 2003 wrote her last book, ""I Will Survive, and You Will Too."" Despite her battle with cancer, Messner told King she kept her Christian faith, instructing her doctors not to tell her how much time they believed she had left. ""I don't have any date written on me anywhere that says I'm going to die at any time, and so I just give it to the Lord,"" she said. Asked if she had a message for her fans, she replied: ""I'd like to say that I genuinely love you, and I genuinely care, and I genuinely want to see you in heaven someday. I want you to find peace. I want you to find joy."" E-mail to a friend .","NEW: Ex-husband Jim Bakker: ""She lived her life like the song she sang""

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- One small slice Monday of Mexican President Felipe Calderon's war on drug cartels: two shootouts on the streets of two cities; a man and a woman ambushed in their car; at least four people dead; three soldiers wounded, one of them gravely. Suspected members of Los Zetas drug cartel are presented to reporters in Mexico City in April. The confrontations between unidentified gunmen and Mexican army and federal police took place in the communities of San Nicolas de los Garza and Escobedo, near the U.S. border in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, the state-run Notimex news agency said. One of the firefights lasted 45 minutes. At one point, the suspects launched hand grenades at the soldiers. House-to-house searches took two hours and it would be another seven hours before the areas were secured. According to Notimex and news reports from the newspapers Excelsior, El Porvenir, El Nuevo Leon and El Norte, here's what happened: . Around 6 a.m., a military convoy came across a group armed men in several late-model vehicles in San Nicolas de los Garza. Shooting broke out, and the gunplay continued for 45 minutes along several neighboring streets as the suspects tried to get away. The armed men abandoned their cars, blocked one of the streets with a Suburban truck and fled aboard several other vehicles. The confrontation continued for another two hours as soldiers sealed off a city block and searched house-to-house. ""From early on, we could hear the shots and much shouting,"" Excelsior and El Nuevo Leon quoted an unidentified woman as saying. ""We could hear footsteps on the roofs and soldiers yelling to them. There were several explosions; it seems like grenades went off, because we could hear it very loudly twice."" Around 7:45 a.m., the soldiers entered a house where the gunmen had holed up. A grenade went off upstairs. Three gunmen died there, though officials did not say if it was from bullet wounds or the grenade explosion. At the same time, Mexican military and federal police were involved in a shootout with armed men in Escobedo. That confrontation left three soldiers wounded, with one of them clinging to life Monday afternoon. Also nearby, a man and a woman riding in car were ambushed at an intersection by armed men in several cars who surrounded them and drilled their auto with bullets. The woman died on the scene, her body sprawled on the street. The man was wounded but survived. The violent scene in Nuevo Leon, which borders Texas, has become a near-daily experience in Mexico since Calderon took office in December 2006 and launched a war on drug cartels. More than 11,000 people have been killed during that time -- about 1,000 of them police and other authorities.","Two shootouts in two cities near U.S. border in Mexican state of Nuevo Leon .

"Bloomington, Indiana (CNN) -- Those fundamentalist members of the Iranian government who have long sought to blow up any possibility for the normalization of relations between Tehran and Washington may just have succeeded. At the very least they are likely to have put any negotiations with Iran on issues ranging from nuclear power to the Iraqi insurrection and the Taliban counterattack in Afghanistan on the back burner. An Iranian-American, Manssor Arbabsiar, has been charged in a plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. According to U.S. authorities, the plot included hiring a DEA informant posing as a member of a Mexican drug cartel who asked for $1.5 million to explode a bomb in a restaurant frequented by the Saudi Ambassador. The Iranian-American allegedly had been recruited and directed by his cousin, Abdul Reza Shahlai, a senior member of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iran, and by Shahlai's deputy, Ali Gholam Shakuri. Arbabsiar was recruited in early spring and began arranging the terror plot in late May of this year using monies wired from Iran at the direction of the Iranian government, prosecutors revealed. Shakuri has also been charged in absentia in the criminal complaint that was filed by the FBI in the Federal Court of the Southern District of New York. The Iranian government has denied any involvement. While in New York for the U.N. General Assembly meetings last month, Iranian President Ahmedinejad and his Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi suggested that relations between Tehran and Western governments need to improve. They also indicated that negotiations over Iran's nuclear program should be re-started. Their recent comments came on the heels of several months of outreach by the Iranian president's office to the United States and European Union. The current terror plot may have been, in part, an attempt by others within the Iranian government to sabotage those discussions before they can begin. The United States is expected to ask that the Security Council impose additional sanctions against Iran for the terror plot. The Revolutionary Guard Corps was founded after the Iranian revolution of 1979. It complements, supplements and often eclipses Iran's regular military forces in resources, manpower, tactics, and operations. The IRGC's overall commander, Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, who was appointed by and is loyal to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, recently threatened ""military action against all other who disavow the Islamic Revolution."" Another IRGC officer, Brig. Gen. Rostam Ghasemi -- who like Jafari is under international sanctions but still heads the influential economic wing of the IRGC (which controls approximately 50 percent of Iran's economy) -- is also Iran's Minister of Petroleum and so currently serves as president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The IRGC's Quds Force is a special unit utilized for enforcing militant fundamentalism at home, ensuring the mullahs stay in power to the dismay of many Iranian citizens, exporting the Islamic revolution to other nations, supporting Iran's political cronies abroad and conducting terrorist attacks against foreign targets. The Quds Force reports directly to Supreme Leader Khamenei, who appointed its commander Brig. Gen. Qasem Soleimani -- another Iranian official listed as a terrorist by the U.S. government. Soleimani is suspected by the U.S. government of helping shape the terror plot just thwarted by the United States . The IRGC generally and its Quds Force specifically have been implicated in several terrorist attacks on Americans, Israelis, and others. The July 1994 bombing that killed 85 persons at a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires was traced back by the government of Argentina (and even noted in the U.S. Congressional Record) to the IRGC. The June 1996 truck bomb that killed 19 U.S. servicemen in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, was believed by the 9/11 Commission to have been assembled at an IRGC facility and then provided to its partner in crime Hezbollah, which carried out the attack. The IRGC has trained and armed not only the Lebanese Hezbollah but also Palestinian Hamas, Shiite militants in Iraq, and even Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. Now it is suspected of sharing tactics and weapons with Bashar al-Assad's troops against protestors in Syria's current populist uprising. So, many of the IRGC's international activities are aimed at weakening the United States and preventing American attempts to stabilize the Middle East and South Asia. The choice of a Saudi diplomat as the plot's target is not surprising. Saudi Arabia sent troops to Bahrain in March to put down a rebellion by that island nation's majority Shiite population who are tied religiously to Tehran. The Saudi government blames Iran for instigating both Bahraini unrest and Shiite protests in eastern Saudi Arabia. So, the Sunni monarchy in Riyadh has been trying to line up a coalition of Sunni Muslim states to oppose Iran's ambitions in the Middle East specifically. The timing of Arbabsiar's recruitment for the terror plot suggests the assassination is also in part tit-for-tat retribution for the Saudi military action against Shiites in Bahrain. Planning the plot for Washington fits well with hardliners in Tehran detesting the U.S. government for threatening military actions and spearheading economic sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program. The Stuxnet computer worm attack on Iran's nuclear facilities in June 2010, and the assassination of Iranian scientists, all of which are attributed by Tehran to Washington and Jerusalem may also have factored into this attempt at retaliation. In the wake of the 1979 Islamic Revolution many Iranians from all walks of life fled to North America and Europe. They and their descendants are by and large opposed to the fundamentalist regime in Iran and have become loyal citizens of the United States and other countries to which they emigrated. So, if the charges are true, the person arrested is an anomaly. Likewise our own research in Iran has shown that most Iranians feel goodwill toward Americans and seek renewal of relations with the United States. Those in Tehran who plotted these attacks intended to sunder that goodwill between peoples and to further alienate their own citizens from the rest of the world. Those terrorist masterminds should not be permitted to get away with their plans at home or abroad. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jamsheed K. Choksy and Carol E. B. Choksy.","U.S. authorities charged that a terror plot was planned by Iranian officials .

"(CNN) -- Sylvia Robinson, a singer-songwriter who went on to become a pioneer in the hip-hop music business, introducing the seminal ""Rapper's Delight,"" died Thursday in New Jersey of congestive heart failure. She was 76. Best known as an artist for 1973's sultry ""Pillow Talk,"" Robinson was a ""trendsetter"" in music, publicist Lynn K. Hobson told CNN. ""She was known as the founder of hip-hop,"" Hobson said. ""She was vibrant, with an over-the-top personality."" Robinson's singing, producing and songwriting career dated back to the 1950s, when she recorded as ""Little Sylvia"" and later as one half of the duo ""Mickey & Sylvia."" The team's hit ""Love Is Strange,"" which hit the pop charts in early 1957 and reached No. 1 on the rhythm-and-blues chart, found new life three decades later in the 1987 movie ""Dirty Dancing.""

Born Sylvia Vanterpool, Robinson and her late husband, Joe, founded Sugar Hill Records in 1979 and released the early hip hop hit, ""Rapper's Delight,"" performed by the Sugar Hill Gang. Her eldest son, Joey, was a member of the group she formed. The song, which adapted the musical track of Chic's ""Good Times,"" began with the familiar lines, ""I said a hip hop, a hippie, a hippie to the hip hip hop, you don't stop to rock it."" The label also signed Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, which had success in the 1980s, including the hit ""The Message."" Kanye West and Alicia Keys are among the artists who sampled songs associated with Robinson, Hobson said. The funeral is scheduled for October 11 at Community Baptist Church in Englewood, New Jersey.

"(CNN) -- If you are like a lot of people, you've probably thought about trying to find out more about your family history some day. How did your parents first meet? Where did your grandparents come from? What were the family secrets that no one ever discussed? Two years ago, I set out to do just that. Mine was a story with some superficial details that had always made for good dinner party conversation: My parents were an interracial couple who met in the mid-1950s, when ""miscegenation"" was still illegal in most states in America. My father was an undergraduate at Swarthmore College, the only black male student on campus. My mother was a white French professor who cast him in a student play. When they fell in love, they had to meet in secret for a year and a half until he graduated, after which they immediately married. They both came from fascinating backgrounds: He was the son of black undertakers from Pittsburgh, who had grown up in a world that was a cross between an August Wilson play and ""Six Feet Under."" She had come to America from France as a teenage refugee with five of her seven sisters while their father, a Huguenot pastor, stayed behind to organize the small mountain village where he preached to hide thousands of Jews from the Nazis. Read an excerpt from ""My Long Trip Home"" But as intriguing as those facts were, I knew that my family story didn't end there. It also included what happened after my parents divorced seven years later: My mother struggled with depression and financial hardship as she was forced to support my younger brother and me on her own. My father plummeted into an alcoholic spiral that destroyed his promising career as an Africa scholar. I battled loneliness and obesity and teenage fury as I coped with feelings of abandonment. I knew I couldn't revisit the romantic aspects of the story without also reliving the tragic parts, and for most of my adult life I had no desire to do that. Then, on the Saturday after Thanksgiving 2009, a year to the day after my father died, I woke up in the middle of the night with an urgent epiphany: I was finally ready to write my family's story. I got out of bed and started recording memories on my laptop computer. But I quickly realized how much I didn't know, or wasn't certain I recalled correctly. So I decided to tackle the project as a reporter, applying all the skills I had acquired in 35 years as a journalist. And for anyone who has thought about embarking on a similar journey, here are some of the lessons I learned: . Don't take ""I don't remember"" for an answer. Many of the ""sources"" for my story -- my mother and her friends, my father's older sister, his other wives and mistresses -- were now in their 70s or 80s. At first, they all insisted that they had forgotten most of what happened. But I asked to speak with them anyway, always arranging to meet them early enough in the day that they weren't tired and to make sure that they had all afternoon and evening free if necessary, so that we wouldn't be cut short. Luckily, their mental faculties were still intact. Once they got started, one memory led to another, and I ended up talking with them for hours and filling notebook after notebook. Their recall became particularly sharp when they were telling me why something I thought I knew was wrong. The urge to correct the record, I discovered, is a powerful aide-memoire. Look for every written document you can find. I asked all of my interview subjects to give me whatever they had on paper from the time: diaries, letters, academic notes and reports. Some of it no longer had relevance, but the prospecting yielded many nuggets of gold. My mother found a diary that her father had written as a missionary in Africa in the 1930s, dreaming of returning to Europe to help battle Hitler. Longtime friends gave me a series of letters that my mother had written in the happy early years of her marriage, when I was a toddler and my parents took me with them to England and Africa while they did field research. There was another batch from the ugliest days of their divorce, when we were living in Los Angeles and she was on the verge of losing her mind. My father's brother-in-law searched through a drawer and found a 12-page testimonial that my black granddad dictated to an attendant in a nursing home on his 75th birthday. His ""autobiography,"" as he called it, recorded how he grew up on a tenant farm in Texas, the son of a sharecropper who was born a slave, and how he made his way north as a teenager to work in the Pittsburgh steel plants and then became one of the city's first black funeral home owners. Explore the surrounding history. With the help of interlibrary lending and the Internet, I tracked down archives and out-of-print books and court records that helped paint a larger picture of the worlds that my parents and grandparents inhabited. Thanks to Google Maps' Street View, I was able to look at pictures of some of the many homes where I lived as a child, some remarkably the same as I remembered, others sadly gone or condemned. And like any good investigative reporter, I used the details I discovered in the written documents to question my sources again. These later interviews often elicited secrets that hadn't emerged before -- like the grounds for my parents' divorce, or the legal battle my father fought after being fired from one of his university jobs, or the details of the hard-core rehab facility where he stayed for six months to finally stop drinking. Not everyone who reports their family story will be obsessed enough to write a book about it, as I have done. But you are bound to discover things that will surprise, amuse and even shock you. And if you're like me, you will find it enlightening to start seeing your family members not just as forces in your life, but as characters in a drama -- shaped by historical time and geographical place and their own personal angels and demons, like protagonists in a novel. ""Was it therapeutic?"" people ask me, and the answer is yes, but in a different way from conventional treatment. Call it ""contextual therapy"": the placement of your own story in a wider human narrative, where every family story is utterly unique yet entirely universal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Whitaker.","Mark Whitaker set out to tell the story of his family, a year after his father died .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, there will be a vote in Ohio that may turn out to be the first major skirmish in the 2012 battle for the White House. At issue is a law known as Senate Bill 5. The law, passed by the Ohio legislature at the end of March, restricts the ability of public employees to engage in collective bargaining. Even before the ink on Ohio Gov. John Kasich's signature on Senate Bill 5 had time to dry, public employee unions in Ohio and their allies began the process of gathering the signatures necessary to invoke a provision in the Ohio Constitution that allows legislation to be placed before the state's voters. Within a few months, Senate Bill 5 opponents had managed to collect nearly 1 million valid signatures, more than three times what they needed to place the law on the November ballot. The campaign to repeal Senate Bill 5, led by a group called ""We Are Ohio,"" quickly went national. For example, The National Education Association donated $2 million to We Are Ohio, while, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the Communication Workers of American kicked in more than $1 million apiece. As Election Day draws near, those who support Senate Bill 5 have also attracted out- of-state assistance. Citizens United, the group whose legal challenge led to the watershed 2010 Supreme Court campaign finance decision, spent $100,000 on pro-Senate Bill 5 commercials. Why all this national interest in an Ohio issue? Former House Speaker Tip O'Neill was famous for saying that ""All politics is local."" Well, in Ohio, all politics is also national. Ohio is the quintessential swing state. Although shrinking in population relative to the rest of the country (after the 2010 census, the Buckeye state lost two seats in Congress), Ohio's electoral vote total is seen by the Republicans and the Democrats as being both up-for-grabs, and crucial to putting together an electoral majority. It is no accident, therefore, that since becoming President, Obama has visited Ohio more than any other state. Still, President Obama's laser-like focus on Ohio has yielded little in the way of political support for him or his party. During the 2010 midterm election, Democrats in Ohio were swept out of power. Republicans managed to capture the governor's mansion and every other statewide office, 13 of the state's 18 congressional seats (a gain of 5 seats), and a majority in the Ohio House of Representatives (they already controlled the Ohio Senate). Republicans in Ohio and nationwide saw in the results of the 2010 elections a mandate to trim back government at all levels. Taking on public employee unions was a logical step in this plan. Still, one can't ignore the fact that, in seeking to weaken public employee unions, the Republicans were also taking on the very groups who would be expected to bankroll Democrats in 2012. But if Senate Bill 5 was fueled as much by politics as by ideology, the approach may have backfired. Polls have shown Senate Bill 5 to be enormously unpopular. Even the bill's supporters are not optimistic that it will survive Tuesday's vote. The fear now among Republicans is not only that Senate Bill 5 will be repealed, but that organized labor in Ohio will emerge from this victory newly energized and better positioned to achieve its goals. This will not bode well for the GOP in 2012. There is a fascinating historical parallel to all of this. Back in 1958, business owners in Ohio got together and placed a proposed constitutional amendment on the state's ballot that would have made Ohio a right-to-work state. The proposal was soundly defeated, with 60% of the voters rejecting the measure. The voters of Ohio, however, did not just vote against the amendment; they also voted against the Republican Party that was seen to have backed the measure. In the election of 1958, the incumbent Republican governor, a longtime Republican senator and nearly every statewide Republican office holder went down in defeat. Polls showing Senate Bill 5 losing by nearly the same margin as the 1958 right-to-work measure ought to be sending chills down the spines of Buckeye Republicans. Of course, Gov. Kasich and the other statewide office holders who were elected in 2010 are not on the ballot this Tuesday, and in fact will not have to face the voters again until 2014. But there will be a Republican presidential candidate on the ballot next year. It will be interesting to see if history repeats itself. Since no one has been elected president in more than 50 years without winning Ohio, it may well be that vote to repeal Senate Bill 5 in Ohio helps determine who will be taking the presidential oath in January of 2013. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Sracic.","Ohioans will vote Tuesday on whether to repeal Senate Bill 5 .

"(CNN) -- Apple has acknowledged a problem with battery life on the iPhone 4S and other devices running its new operating system. The company says a software update coming ""in a few weeks"" will address the problem. The company previously had not publicly acknowledged complaints about battery life on the phone, which surfaced soon after it was released October 14 and continued to grow in the weeks since. ""A small number of customers have reported lower than expected battery life on iOS 5 devices,"" Apple said in a statement to AllThingsD, a part of the Wall Street Journal network. ""We have found a few bugs that are affecting battery life and we will release a software update to address those in a few weeks."" Comments on a thread started October 15 in Apple's support forums to complain about battery life had grown to 217 pages by Thursday morning. Apple has declined to comment beyond its basic statement. Messages from CNN requesting information about the complaints were not returned. The poorer-than-expected battery life has largely been attributed to location-based apps and other power-draining features of the iOS 5 system. Some users have reported improvements when they disable time-zone and GPS features, while others have said the improvements were minimal. The apparent glitch is the second time in a row that a popular iPhone has experienced a highly publicized problem in its early days. And the responses, so far, have been similar. The iPhone 4 suffered from what some called the death grip, causing users who held the phone in a certain way to lose phone calls. Apple denied that there was a problem before eventually saying that it did, in fact, affect a small number of customers. The company eventually offered free cases, which improved the phone's reception. Neither time has the problem affected sales in a major way. The iPhone 4 is the most popular smartphone in the world, and the 4S is on track to perform just as well, starting with a reported 4 million sales in its first three days on the market.","Apple admits iPhone 4S battery-drain problems .

"Hanover, New Hampshire (CNN) -- Herman Cain, the latest Republican presidential candidate to surge in the polls, found himself in the hot seat Tuesday night at a debate in New Hampshire centered on economic matters. The linchpin of Cain's campaign, his cleverly titled 9-9-9 plan to restructure the U.S. Tax Code, came under harsh scrutiny as other Republicans sought to knock the former Godfather's Pizza CEO off his pedestal. The Cain plan would implement a 9% corporate income tax rate, a 9% income tax rate and a 9% national sales tax. His opponents called the plan unrealistic and said it stands zero chance of passing on Capitol Hill. ""I think it's a catchy phrase, in fact, I thought it was the price of a pizza when I first heard it ,"" former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman joked. ""We need something that's doable, doable, doable."" Two candidates competing with Cain for conservative voters in the leadoff caucus state of Iowa, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, sharply questioned Cain's economic credentials. Santorum asked audience members at Dartmouth College to raise their hands if they support a new sales tax. No one in the crowd appeared to do so. ""There you go, Herman. That's how many votes you'll get in New Hampshire."" He added, ""Can we trust you with your lack of experience that you won't continually give Washington the ability to take freedom away from freedom-loving people?"" Bachmann said the plan would do little to create jobs and would simply offer the government a new way to collect tax revenue. ""When you take the 9-9-(9) plan and you turn it upside won, the devil is in the details,"" Bachmann said, a reference to 666, a symbol commonly associated with Satan. Cain defended his plan as a fresh solution. ""Therein lies the difference between me, the nonpolitician, and all of the politicians,"" he said. ""They want to pass what they think they can get passed rather than what we need, which is a bold solution."" Rep. Ron Paul of Texas also attacked Cain for naming former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan as the kind of person he would appoint to the Fed if elected. ""Alan Greenspan was a disaster,"" Paul said, saying that Greenspan manipulated American currency and helped usher in the current economic crisis. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich attacked the current Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, and said the central banking system should be subject to greater oversight. ""Bernanke has in secret spent hundred of billions of dollars bailing out one group and not bailing out another group,"" Gingrich said. ""It is corrupt and wrong for one man to have that secret power."" Eight candidates participated in the economy-themed debate at Dartmouth College, sponsored by Bloomberg Television and The Washington Post. While some candidates trained their sights on Cain, others tried to sully former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who has solidified his lead in national polls and in New Hampshire, a state central to his nomination strategy. But as in previous debates, Romney, a tested campaigner, parried several attacks and kept the focus on jobs and the economy. Share your view on the debate . In one portion of the debate, moderators allowed the candidates to ask questions of one another. Texas Gov. Rick Perry pressed Romney on his health care overhaul in Massachusetts, which he compared to Obama's national plan. Romney turned the question around on Perry. ""We have less than 1% of our kids that are uninsured,"" Romney said. ""You have a million kids uninsured in Texas. A million kids. Under President Bush, the percentage uninsured went down. Under your leadership, it's gone up."" Perry, who has been criticized by Romney for not outlining a detailed economic plan, said he would begin rolling out a platform in the coming days, beginning with a speech this week on boosting domestic energy production.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- An extraordinarily high level of radiation was detected in one spot in a central Tokyo residential district Thursday, prompting the local government to cordon off the small area, local officials said. Radiation levels were higher in Tokyo's Setagaya ward than in the evacuation area around the badly damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, according to ward Mayor Nobuto Hosaka. ""We are shocked to see such high radiation level was detected in our neighborhood. We cannot leave it as is,"" Hosaka told reporters. But the tsunami-struck Fukushima plant may not be the source of the radiation, Hosaka said later on state television. Officials searching for the cause found ""glass bottles in a cardboard box"" in the basement of a house in the neighborhood which sent radiation detectors off the charts, he said on NHK. ""We suspect these bottles in basement could be the cause of the high radiation reading and we are hastily working to confirm it,"" he said. Radiation experts are now checking what contaminated the bottles, a Setagaya ward official told CNN, declining to be named in line with policy. They told the local government there are no immediate health hazards. Radiation levels just a few feet from the contaminated spot are normal, Hosaka said. The Tokyo scare comes a day after officials in Yokohama, Japan's second largest city, investigated soil samples after a radioactive substance was found in sediment atop an apartment building, according to news reports. Yokohama is about 155 miles (250 kilometers) from the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant. The discovery raised concerns that leaked radiation from three Fukushima reactors that suffered meltdowns after the March earthquake and tsunami may be more widespread than thought, The Japan Times reported Wednesday. The U.S. government issued a travel alert last week, warning Americans in Japan to avoid areas near the stricken reactors. The alert recommends that U.S. citizens stay away from areas within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the nuclear facility. The State Department also admonished Americans to stay away from territory northwest of the plant in a zone that Japan calls the ""Deliberate Evacuation Area."" The zone includes Iitate-mura, the Yamagiya district of Kawamata-machi, Katsurao-mura, Namie-machi and parts of Minamisoma. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.","NEW: There is no immediate health hazard, experts tell local officials .

"London (CNN) -- A breakthrough in graphene research which could pave the way for new smaller, faster, more powerful computer chips has be made by UK researchers. Scientists at the UK's University of Manchester say they have demonstrated how graphene -- a two-dimensional material made from a single layer of carbon atoms -- could look inside electronic circuits of the future. Graphene has been hailed as a ""miracle material"" which could revolutionize materials science because of its unique properties. Measuring one atom thick, it it the thinnest material on Earth -- a stack of three million sheets would rise to the grand height of one millimeter. Graphene is also the strongest (200 times stronger than steel), the most flexible and the most conductive material in the world -- which makes it an attractive alternative to the silicon chip. In their study, published in the journal Nature Physics, researchers report how they created a four-layered structure consisting of two sheets of graphene sandwiched between two sheets of boron nitride -- a similar two-dimensional material with a thin hexagonal-like structure. ""Creating the multilayer structure has allowed us to isolate graphene from negative influence of the environment and control graphene's electronic properties in a way it was impossible before,"" Leonid Ponomarenko, lead author of the study. This ""negative influence"" relates to graphene's ultra sensitivity to gases and humidity says Ponomarenko, which scientists at the university reported on back in 2007. ""To make its properties more controllable, we have to protect it with something,"" he said. The demonstration brings a replacement for the silicon chip one step closer, according to Ponomarenko. They are reaching their limit for being scaled down, he says, and as computers get more powerful silicon is struggling to meet the increasing energy demands. The discovery of graphene was made at the university in 2004 by Russian physicists Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, who received the Nobel prize for physics for their work in 2010. Commenting on the new research, Geim said: ""Graphene encapsulated within boron nitride offers the best and most advanced platform for future graphene electronics. It solves nasty issues about graphene's stability and quality... ""It could be only a matter of several months before we have encapsulated graphene transistors with characteristics better than previously demonstrated,"" he added. Recent advances at Manchester and other UK universities has prompted the British government to invest Â£50 million ($78 million) in a research hub with the aim of maximizing the commercial potential of graphene. Its not just computer circuit boards that graphene promises to transform. The discovery that it is extremely sensitive to single molecules of gas could, according to Geim and Novoselov, lead to the development of new sensors, with possible applications in counter-terrorism. ""We are constantly looking at new ways of demonstrating and improving the remarkable properties of graphene,"" Geim said. Countless universities around the world are also engaged in the same task. The U.S.'s Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, have recently discovered that graphene ""exhibits a novel reaction to light,"" which they say could improve night-vision systems and possibly provide a new approach to solar power. Excitement is building in the consumer electronics market too, as phone and computer manufacturers look to capitalize on graphene's uniqueness as a transparent conductor. ""The vision is to have electronic devices which can be integrated with your body or clothing, or computers which can be bent or rolled up and put away,"" said professor Andrea Ferrari, professor of nanotechnology at the UK's University of Cambridge. Researchers at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, South Korea have already demonstrated a flexible touchscreen, he says. And rumors were rife in cyberspace recently that South Korean electronics company, Samsung were going to release a flexible smartphone, called the ""Galaxy Skin"" in 2012. It turned out to be untrue, but bendable phones, computers and televisions may not be far off, says Ferrari. ""It may well be that in the next three or four years, if everything goes well, we may see some transparent and flexible devices made from graphene come to the market.""","New research at UK university demonstrates how graphene-based computer chip might look .

"(CNN) -- Last night my youngest son, fresh out of college, and I got into a heated debate over who affected our culture more: Bob Dylan or Steve Jobs. On the surface this was the kind of crazy, even absurd, argument that families often get into. But dig deeper, and it was about how generations define themselves: through the lyrics of one of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century or the objects of one the greatest visionaries of the century, through resistance to an unpopular war and opposition to unjust social practices or through the use of products that that have changed how we work, play and communicate with each other. Writing on my MacBook, with an iPhone in my pocket and an iPad on the table next to me, it is easy to argue that Jobs' achievement was not only that he reimagined how technology could be used but that he redefined how it could look. Can anyone really think anymore of working on a personal computer that does not have a brushed and machined aluminum casing or that is not sleek and thin, perfectly balanced, not so light as to be insignificant nor too heavy as to be not genuinely portable? Can anyone accept an awkward interface whose icons don't know how to dance gracefully to a downloaded tune suggested by Genius? Jobs' insistence on objects whose look paralleled their use â€” not in the modernist sense of form following function but in his commitment to making devices that looked as good as they functioned -- made owning an Apple a deeply personal statement. And his relentless commitment to getting the details right, the shape of a screen, for instance, or the appearance and click of a keyboard, the size and location of the track pad, or something as simple as an on/off switch or a magnetic power cord connection, set a standard that every competitor has tried to match. Apple's elegance and refinement of technology can, of course, be seen simply as a clever marketing strategy, a means of differentiating itself in a crowded marketplace. But despite the company's rigid protection of its brand, the way Apple treats the design of its products transcends any simple notion of branding. Jobs realized that the digital generation not only wanted access to an endless array of information and entertainment, it wanted it delivered in a way that projected the user's sense of self; that personal style mattered as much as function. Apple's ability to find a way to consistently make its products look and act better than similar products while appealing to individuals of every age and walk of life â€” kids as well as grandparents, hipsters as well as bankers â€” and from almost every corner of the planet is about a brand going viral and becoming a cultural phenomenon. And that gets us back to Dylan, whose music shaped and defined a generation here and abroad. In a very different way, and with a very different meaning but with at least as great an impact, Apple has become an almost universal sign of belonging to a connected and open world that is deeply curious and innovative and is youthful in spirit. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Glenn D. Lowry.","Glenn Lowry says Steve Jobs, like Bob Dylan, is icon who helps generation define itself .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States will send a team to North Korea this year to search for the remains of missing U.S. veterans of the Korean War, the Defense Department announced Friday. The search -- the first such mission in seven years -- will be conducted sometime this spring by members of the Joint Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Accounting Command. ""We're always grateful for the opportunity to recover the remains of our fallen heroes from past wars,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said. ""And we are hopeful that this process will occur sooner rather than later. I don't have a specific time frame to give you, but this is something that is very important to us and we'll clearly focus on."" Beginning in 1996, North Korean and U.S. military teams conducted 33 joint recovery missions looking for remains inside North Korea. More than 225 sets of remains were located, and brought out of the reclusive country. But all that changed in 2005 when then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld suspended the work, saying that due to rising nuclear tensions at the time, he felt the safety of the U.S. teams could not be guaranteed. U.S troops killed in action have a last ally . Following talks between the two sides in October, officials agreed to resume the searches this year, according to Air Force Maj. Carie Parker, spokeswoman for the POW/Missing Personnel Office. The mission, which will include both U.S. and North Korean military personnel, will search two areas of North Korea: Unsan County and near the Chosin/Jangjin reservoir, according to the Defense Department. About 8,000 U.S. service members are listed as ""unaccounted for"" from the Korean War, the 1950-1953 conflict often referred to as the ""forgotten war.""","The mission aims to recover the remains of missing U.S. veterans of the Korean War .

"(CNN) -- Greece may be in an economic mess these days, but the ancient gods are back in vogue, at least in Hollywood, where the success of ""300"" and ""Percy Jackson"" novelist Rick Riordan has not gone unnoticed. Combine that with today's computer-generated visuals, which allow you to conjure up armies of extras at the press of a button, and ""Immortals"" virtually writes itself. (In fact the dour, humorless screenplay is credited to Charley and Vias Parlapanides.) Less ""300 2"" than ""300 3D,"" ""Immortals"" is a sledgehammer action spectacle interspersed with bouts of enervating pseudo-philosophical discourse and moments of fine visual embellishment. Rising star Henry Cavill (""The Tudors"" and Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"") is Theseus, a Hellenic commoner who never knew his father, but who has found a kindly mentor in a wise old man who schools him in sword fighting, ethics and such. What Theseus doesn't know is that the old guy (played by John Hurt on Earth and Luke Evans when mortal eyes aren't peeking) is actually Zeus, the king of the gods, who has been grooming the lad to lead the Hellenics against the onslaught of the blood-thirsty Hyperion (Mickey Rourke). If Hyperion gets his mitts on the Bow of Epirus (archery's answer to a ballistic missile), he'll free the Titans and all hell will break loose. Why doesn't Zeus intervene directly? Apparently that's against the divine rules, though the Olympians aren't above bending them whenever Hyperion seems on the verge of a decisive blow. Wearing scrummy gold outfits that wouldn't look out of place in a Vegas toga party, the gods are the Hellenics' pinch-hitters supreme. Director Tarsem Singh (""The Fall,"" ""The Cell"") is a fabulist; more than anything, he wants his images to shine. And they do, in places. A vision of celestials locked in permanent heavenly combat -- inspired by the Sistine Chapel -- is simply breathtaking. (It's virtually the last thing we see in the movie, but before you shout ""spoiler,"" it's also the poster image.) The costume and design are often out of this world. And yet the movie's landscape is a disappointingly barren digital domain, the same gray cliffs, deserts and seas familiar from ""300"" and so many game-worlds. It's not just that this is visually blah (though it is), it's also as inherently artificial and airless as any studio movie of the 1930s or 40s. When Singh's camera catches a sun-flare at morning or dusk, it's supposed to imbue the shot with a sense of reality. But because that sunbeam is patently just another digital effect, it actually accomplishes the opposite: it falsifies the actors' environment and reminds us this isn't really happening. (I counted the trick three times.) To my eyes, the 3D only makes the movie look phonier; the actors often seem to exist in a different visual plane to their surroundings. They might as well be performing in front of cardboard flats. Still, in Rourke, Cavill, Evans, Stephen Dorff (as Theseus' sidekick Stavros), and Frieda Pinto (as the so-called ""Virgin Oracle""), Tarsem has cast actors strong or pretty enough to hold us through the movie's turgid breast-beating, grisly violence and numbskull plotting. There aren't many flicks that Mickey Rourke can't perk up, and here he's adorned in the full enchilada, even more scars than nature intended, a shimmering silver face mask, and a bonnet that seems to have been modeled on a Venus flytrap. Another (this is a heck of a mad-hatter's movie) has horns like a lobster claw -- or a jackass. In short, the plumage is eye-catching but the meat doesn't have much flavor. The stuff of legend it ain't.","The film stars Henry Cavill who will also be the ""Man of Steel""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The day after little Jorelys Rivera's mangled body was found in a suburban Atlanta trash compactor, Ryan Brunn sat in a stark room for a police interview. He began with confidence, but ended with trouble. Keith Sitton, a special agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, hooked up the jeans-clad Brunn to a polygraph machine. Then, he fired off a series of questions to the 20-year-old maintenance man. A videotape of Brunn's polygraph test was released Thursday. ""Regarding that girl, do you intend to answer these questions truthfully?"" ""Yes."" ""Did you participate in any way in causing the death of that girl?"" ""No."" ""Did you cause the death of that girl?"" ""No."" ""Do you know for sure who caused the death of that girl?"" ""No."" Sitton asked the questions three times. Each time, Brunn said he had nothing to do with Jorelys' killing. By the end of the interview, Sitton knew better. Brunn had turned into a prime suspect. In the videotape, he tells Brunn that he did poorly on the questions regarding his alleged participation in Jorelys' death and the disposal of her body. ""I can see you're not doing good on this test,"" Sitton says. ""Those two questions are really bothering me."" ""I'm not holding back,"" Brunn says. ""I promise you. I'll take the test again."" But that was not an option for Brunn. The next day, on December 7, he was arrested. Eventually, he pleaded guilty and, standing before a judge in a Cherokee County courthouse, he described in detail how he enticed, molested and killed Jorelys, 7, in Canton, 40 miles north of Atlanta. After he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, Brunn hanged himself with his sweathshirt in a prison cell. It was that polygraph test that was started Brunn's unraveling. ""I've been doing this for a long time,"" Sitton tells Brunn at the start of the session. But Brunn seems not at all concerned about the questions he is about to face. Some people think they can beat a polygraph test, said Dr. Peter Ash, a forensic psychiatrist at Emory University in Atlanta. ""The fact is that most of them can't do it,"" he said. ""You can control how you look. You can't control how you sweat."" Besides, said Ash, criminals are not known for good judgment. His shirt sleeve rolled up to his shoulders, Brunn begins by telling Sitton that on a scale of one to 10, he is a 7.5 on the truth meter. That he had lied the day before when police asked him whether he'd run the trash compactor at the River Ridge Apartments in Canton, where Jorelys's body was found. ""I should have just told the truth straight up,"" Brunn says. ""But I didn't. I was scared."" Brunn tells Sitton that his family was originally from New York but he had been living in Dahlonega, Georgia. He moved to the Canton complex in November, where he was living at a discount and working in maintenance. He'd finished 10th grade but no more. Sitton tells him it's never too late to graduate. Brunn went to Honduras a few years back on a church mission to help rebuild houses for the needy. Sutton asks him if he smoked marijuana. Brunn admits to smoking the night before. He answers Sitton's questions with apparent ease, not as a man who had committed a heinous crime. Later in court, he would describe how he used a roller skate to lure Jorelys into a vacant apartment. He told the judge he made the girl undress and wanted to take her for ""sexual purposes."" He said he got scared that she would go home and tell her parents what had happened. So he struck her with the skate, slit her throat and tossed her body into the compactor. He even taped a handwritten note telling investigators that Jorelys was in there, almost as though he wanted his crime to be discovered. By the end of the polygraph test, Brunn's voice is slight. He appears more nervous and goes outside to smoke a cigarette. When he returns, Sitton confronts him about his lies. ""There's something on this that you're not telling us. Something that you are keeping to yourself,"" he says. ""What is it you're holding back? Because we're trying to solve this thing."" Brunn fiddles with his cell phone. Sitton tells him not to worry about his calls, that he's got more important things to worry about. ""It's just written all over you. Something's bothering you."" ""I am not bothered at all."" ""You haven't told the complete truth about everything."" ""I have."" It turns out Brunn lied about smoking pot, as well. He had smoked that morning, not the night before, as he said previously. Sitton tells him that he is concerned about Brunn's marijuana habit. Brunn says he gets high but ""it doesn't make me crazy. I promise you that."" Before the video cuts off, Sitton asks Brunn about allegations he faced in Virginia before his move to Georgia. He had been accused of sexually fondling another girl. ""You know what I'm talking about,"" Sitton says. ""I don't,"" Brunn replies. ""Remember I said you had to be 100% truthful? I asked you if anyone made accusations. So what you done is told me a lie. You also lied about the trash compactor."" ""They put things in that child's head,"" Brunn says. ""I'm a good person. I didn't do nothing to that little Spanish girl and I didn't do nothing to (the other) girl."" There is little remorse in Brunn's words. Later in court, he would tell Jorelys' family that he was sorry. ""Lo siento,"" he said in Spanish. But in front on Jorelys' sobbing mother, Brunn's apology fell far short. Two days later, he, too, was dead.","Ryan Brunn tells an agent in Georgia that he had nothing to do with the killing of Jorelys Rivera .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least 17 people were killed Thursday in bomb attacks in a city near Baghdad and the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, police officials said. Police in Baghdad said 10 people were killed, including two women and three children, when insurgents placed bombs around a house in Musayyeb, a city about 43 miles (70 kilometers) south of the capital. Two police officers, who were brothers, were among those killed in the explosion early Thursday, police said. The house was severely damaged. Later Thursday, armed men shot four civilians to death in western Baghdad's al-Yarmouk neighborhood, police said. A fifth civilian died and another 18 were wounded when two bombs exploded in a coffee shop in al-Saydiya, on the south side of the capital. A roadside bomb wounded two people in Baghdad's Abu Dasheer neighborhood Thursday evening, but no fatalities were immediately reported, according to police. Meanwhile, two civilians were killed and three others wounded when a motorcycle rigged with explosives detonated in a mixed neighborhood in southwestern Kirkuk on Thursday morning, police there said. The ethnically mixed, oil-rich city is about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of Baghdad. Since the beginning of the year, a wave of attacks in Iraq has killed about 200 people. The violence has raised concerns about the ability of Iraqi security forces to ensure order, particularly after the United States withdrew troops at the end of 2011.","NEW: Another five killed in attacks around the Iraqi capital .

"(CNN) -- The last minutes in the life of Steve Jobs were still filled by the epiphanies and moments of inspiration that fed his inventor's mind, according to an intimate portrait provided by Jobs' sister in a eulogy published Sunday in The New York Times. Mona Simpson's eulogy -- originally read during Jobs' memorial service on October 16 -- is a sister's celebration of a brother she knew only later in life, and a lament of losing a best friend. It weaves in words what she believed were the foundations of Jobs' genius: his humility and hard work, his love of learning and his family. ""I want to tell you a few things I learned from Steve, during three distinct periods, over the 27 years I knew him,"" said Simpson in her eulogy. ""They're not periods of years, but of states of being. His full life. His illness. His dying."" Simpson, a writer, and Jobs did not meet until they were adults. Their early family history was fragmented, but set the stage for what later became a deep-rooted friendship between two estranged siblings. After Jobs' birth, his parents gave him up for adoption. Simpson was born later, and the parents subsequently divorced. The best tidbits from the new Steve Jobs biography . One day, Simpson said in her eulogy, when she was living in New York and writing her first novel, a lawyer gave her a call to inform her that her ""long-lost brother"" was rich and famous and wanted to contact her. ""The lawyer refused to tell me my brother's name and my colleagues started a betting pool,"" said Simpson. ""The leading candidate: John Travolta. I secretly hoped for a literary descendant of Henry James -- someone more talented than I, someone brilliant without trying,"" she said. The man who came to meet her -- her brother -- was Steve Jobs. ""Even as a feminist, my whole life I'd been waiting for a man to love, who could love me. For decades, I'd thought that man would be my father. When I was 25, I met that man and he was my brother,"" Simpson said in the eulogy as published in the Times. When they first met, Simpson said, she told her brother she had considered buying a computer but had waited. ""Steve told me it was a good thing I'd waited. He said he was going to make something that was going to be insanely beautiful,"" she said. Jobs' life was not always a smooth ride, his sister said in her eulogy. He skidded through volatile times with Apple executives and eventually was ousted from the company he had founded. ""When he got kicked out of Apple, things were painful. He told me about a dinner at which 500 Silicon Valley leaders met the then-sitting president. Steve hadn't been invited,"" said Simpson. ""He was hurt but he still went to work. ... Every single day,"" she said. Jobs' biographer talks to CNN's Piers Morgan . Simpson said Jobs was sentimental and he spent much time talking about love. He found a partner in life, Laurene Powell, whom he married in 1991, his sister said. ""His abiding love for Laurene sustained him. He believed that love happened all the time, everywhere,"" she wrote. When Jobs' struggle with pancreatic cancer took a turn for the worse, he called his sister and asked her to hurry to his Palo Alto, California, home. His tone, Simpson said, was ""like someone whose luggage was already strapped onto the vehicle, who was already on the beginning of his journey, even as he was sorry, truly deeply sorry, to be leaving us."" Belief blog: Are we turning Steve Jobs into a saint? Even as he struggled physically in his last hours, his sister said, ""there was also sweet Steve's capacity for wonderment, the artist's belief in the ideal, the still more beautiful later."" ""He was working at this, too. Death didn't happen to Steve, he achieved it."" With his family surrounding him, Simpson said, Jobs' last words were: ""Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.

"(CNN) -- The number of aging men and women in U.S. prisons is growing rapidly, Human Rights Watch said Friday, and it expressed concern for their care behind bars. Because of their age, older prisoners incur medical costs that are three to nine times as high as those for younger prisoners, the campaign group said in its 106-page report, titled ""Old Behind Bars: The Aging Prison Population in the United States."" Prison officials are hard-pressed to provide the appropriate housing and medical care for older prisoners, the report says. ""Prisons were never designed to be geriatric facilities,"" said Jamie Fellner, a senior adviser to the U.S. program at Human Rights Watch and author of the report. ""Yet U.S. corrections officials now operate old age homes behind bars."" Human Rights Watch pointed out that life sentences mean those prisoners reach old age in prison. Almost 10% of state prisoners are serving a life sentence, it said, and another 11.2% have sentences longer than 20 years. Prisons face a number of challenges in caring for these prisoners, the group said. They include tight budgets, prison architecture not designed for age-related disabilities, limited medical facilities and staff, lack of support from elected officials, and the pressures of day-to-day operations. It is equally as difficult for the older prisoners themselves who may be frail or impaired. Prison rules and customs weren't designed with them in mind, Human Rights Watch said. ""Walking a long distance to the dining hall, climbing up to a top bunk, or standing for count can be virtually impossible for some older prisoners,"" the group said. ""Incontinence and dementia impose their own burdens."" Human Rights Watch called for changes to harsh sentencing rules regarding long mandatory minimum sentences and reduced opportunities for parole. It also called for changes to prison facilities and medical care, as well as prison rules that are tough on older prisoners. ""How are justice and public safety served by the continued incarceration of men and woman whose bodies and minds have been whittled away by age?"" Fellner asked.","Group says medical costs and prison facilities are not equipped for older prisoners .

"(CNN) -- A prominent Kurdish opposition leader was shot dead Friday in a brazen assault that came as protesters across the country demonstrated for his fledgling anti-regime movement, activists said. Mashaal Tammo, spokesman for the Kurdish Future Party and a member of the newly formed Syria National Council, was killed in a private residence in the northeastern city of Qamishli, one of the cities where protesters gathered Friday. At least eight other people died in the Damascus suburbs and other locations during demonstrations, activists said. ""The violence continues unabated,"" Victoria Nuland, State Department spokeswoman, said on Friday. Tammo's death was reported by three groups -- the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Avaaz, an international activist organization. Tammo's son and another activist, Zahida Rashkilo, were injured. Avaaz said Tammo was meeting with activists at the time. Avaaz said the attackers were members of the Shabiha, the pro-government militia. ""The Kurdish people are very angry as a result,"" an activist told Avaaz. Kurds live in a contiguous area that spreads across Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. Kurdish rebels have fought for an independent state. Human Rights Watch, which notes that the Kurds are the largest non-Arab ethnic minority in Syria, has estimated that Kurds make up about 10% of Syria's population. The Syrian government, viewing Kurdish identity as a threat, has suppressed the group's political and cultural rights. The Syrian National Council announced this month that it will ""represent the Syrian revolution"" inside and outside the country in an effort to end the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The council ""will work on mobilizing all groups of the Syrian people and provide all kinds of necessary support to advance the revolution and achieve the goals of our people that include the toppling of the current regime, including the head of the regime, and building a democratic, multiparty system in a civilian state that provides equality to all its citizens, without any kind of discrimination,"" they said. The LCC said groups including the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria, the Revolution Forces, the Public Council for Revolution Forces and the Superior Council of the Revolution have all joined it in the opposition government. The idea takes a page from the success of the National Transitional Council in Libya, where the opposition movement managed to drive strongman Moammar Gadhafi from power. Anti-government demonstrations have raged in Syria for nearly seven months, and the al-Assad regime has launched a fierce crackdown on protesters. The death toll has exceeded 3,000, the observatory said. Most of those killed have been civilian protesters and others have been security forces. Activists stage nationwide protests with a specific theme every Friday after Muslim prayers. This Friday the protest theme is the ""National Council represents me,"" a reference to the Syrian opposition movement. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, or LCC, reported three deaths in Douma, outside the capital, three in the western city of Homs, one in the coastal city of Latakia and one in the suburbs of Hama, in the west during the day. Riad Saif, a former parliament member and now an opposition leader, was beaten in the Damascus neighborhood of Medan and a massive demonstration unfolded in the Idlib province town of Saraqeb, the LCC said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed three deaths in the Damascus suburbs. It said forces opened fire and wounded more than two dozen people near a Homs mosque. Many world powers have been outraged over the government's crackdown. The European Union and United States have already imposed sanctions against the regime. But earlier this week, Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council draft resolution condemning Syrian authorities for using violence against anti-government demonstrators. The two nations argued that even in its watered-down form without economic sanctions, the proposed resolution would have led to military intervention similar to the NATO operation to protect anti-government protesters in Libya. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said his country wants an end to the bloodshed and is calling for the regime to implement changes, state-run RIA Novosti reported Friday. ""If the Syrian leadership is unable to complete such reforms, it will have to go, but this decision should be made not by NATO and certain European countries, it should be made by the people of Syria and the government of Syria,"" Medvedev told the Russian Security Council. Some countries are taking their own steps to pressure al-Assad. After the U.N. vote, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his government is preparing sanctions on Syria. A U.S. envoy speaking at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, criticized Syria. ""A government that fails to respect the will of its people, denies the fundamental rights of its citizens, and chooses to rule through terror and intimidation, cannot be considered legitimate and must step aside immediately,"" said Betty King, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. and other international organizations in Geneva. Faysal Mekdad, deputy Syrian foreign minister, said, ""it's my feeling that no country should judge a sovereign state's measures."" They were at the council's Universal Periodic Review of Syria.","A Kurdish activist, a member of the opposition Syria National Council, is slain .

"(CNN) -- What started as the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York in September has spread across major cities worldwide as a call to action against unequal distribution of wealth. Here is a roundup of some of the movement's recent developments. DENVER . Police in Denver arrested three protesters Sunday, a day after 17 demonstrators were hauled off to jail. Tensions are high between the two groups, with each side blaming the other for scuffles. Protesters became upset Sunday when police began removing a food table from a park, some of them surrounding a police car. One woman then pushed a Denver police officer, according to a police statement. One officer twisted his knee, while another was treated and released from an area hospital after being hit in the head, police said. On Saturday night, police in riot gear arrested 17 people as they cleared furniture and tents from an Occupy encampment near the city's civic center, police spokesman Sonny Jackson said. The main issue, he said, was that the items were blocking a right of way. ""People are welcome to come back and protest, but we don't want them to do it in a way that's not safe,"" Jackson said. Occupy Denver has accused the police of brutality, saying officers have threatened to ""break the teeth"" of protesters. It said police followed protesters even after they left the park, and assaulted demonstrators who stood on the sidelines. ""These are certainly the kind of actions one might expect from the Egyptian police in the last days of the Arab Spring, but not in Denver,"" the group said. HONOLULU . As President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and the heads of 18 other nations dined together Saturday night, they were unwittingly serenaded for almost 45 minutes by a musician playing a song about the Occupy movement. ""We occupy the streets, we'll occupy the courts, we'll occupy the offices of you, till you do the bidding of the many, not the few,"" sang Matthew Swalinkavich, a well-known local guitarist who calls himself Makana, the Hawaiian word that means ""the gift."" Makana was invited by the White House to perform during the APEC leaders' dinner. Dressed in a suit, Makana at first played traditional Hawaiian-style music as leaders arrived at Honolulu's Hale Koa Hotel. Eventually he unbuttoned his shirt to reveal a T-shirt that said, in handwritten letters, ""Occupy with Aloha,"" and began playing a song he recently wrote, ""We Are the Many."" Video recorded on a cell phone by Makana's sound technician showed some leaders turning their attention toward him as he sang, but most appeared not to notice. ""I started out very cautiously because my intention was not to disrupt their dinner. My intention was to subliminally convey a message that I felt was paramount to the negotiations,"" Makana told CNN. NEW YORK . Dozens of doctors and nurses descended on New York's Zucotti Park on Sunday to administer free flu shots to ward off the risk of a sweeping infection in the close quarters. Some of the medics held up a sign that read, ""I'm a doctor for the 99%"" Others made their way through the park, publicizing their drive and reminding the gathered they didn't have to be a part of the protests to receive the shots. Before the event, the non-profit Physicians for a National Health Program had asked for 99 doctors, nurses and students to administer the doses. Rob Harper told CNN's iReport that some protesters initially were hesitant to receive the shot. ""One man said he would do it but wasn't sure if it was some time of secret government experiment,"" Harper said. ""He eventually took the shot and walk away happy."" Robert Espier, also speaking to CNN's iReport, said the presence of the doctors ""means we have their support, support from all different sectors."" ""All of the doctors there, it was just enough to make an old man get a little watery-eyed,"" Espier, 68, said. OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA . Oakland police issued a third notice for demonstrators to vacate city parks on Saturday, police spokeswoman Officer Johnna Watson told CNN. The protesters had not complied with that order, Watson said. A second notice was issued Saturday morning after a fatal shooting near the camp, according to CNN affiliate KCBS. A man in his early 20s was shot Friday. Authorities said one of the suspects has been ""a frequent resident at the encampment over the past several days,"" KCBS said. PHILADELPHIA . In Philadelphia, Mayor Michael Nutter said Sunday he was increasing police presence near the Occupy Philly camp. ""Occupy Philly has changed,"" he said at a noon press conference. ""We're seeing serious health and safety issues playing out on an almost daily basis... The people of Occupy Philly have also changed and their intentions have changed. And all of this is not good for Philadelphia."" A woman reported she was sexually assaulted Saturday night in a tent at the encampment, Nutter said. CNN affiliate WPVI reported a suspect was arrested in the alleged assault. In addition, there is the threat of fire near historic City Hall and concerns about litter, public urination, defecation and graffiti, according to the mayor. Numerous reports of thefts and assaults in the encampment have been made, and 15 emergency medical runs were made between October 6 and November 11, he said. ""Misconduct is not about free speech,"" the mayor said, ""and the behavior we're now seeing is running squarely into the needs of our city government that also represents the 99%. As mayor of the city of Philadelphia, I represent the 99% also."" PORTLAND, OREGON . Police in Portland, Oregon, made more than 50 arrests Sunday as they cleared two parks -- Chapman and Lownsdale Square -- of protesters. Portland police called in law enforcement reinforcement from surrounding jurisdictions, and more than 300 officers took part in the sweep -- which went off without incident, authorities said. The city parks bureau spent Sunday night fencing off the sites. Mayor Sam Adams said late Sunday afternoon that ""a series of increased drug overdoses... an arsonist that used the camp as camouflage and almost a 20% increase in crime surrounding the encampment"" prompted the move. ""All of us are working really hard at keeping the peace and protecting freedom of expression,"" Adams told CNN. ""I support a lot of what the encampment stands for ... (But) it shouldn't be focused on port-a-potties and tents and encampments attracting criminal elements. I think this movement needs to evolve."" Kari Koch, one of the activists, told CNN that she was ""extremely disappointed that the mayor chose to crack down on these parks when the outpouring of support (among area residents) has been so strong."" ""Homeless people exist, drug addicts exist, mentally ill people exist. We were a safe place they could go, and that created some problems,"" she said. ""And we were working to deal with those problems, and the mayor cut us off."" SALT LAKE CITY . Salt Lake City said 19 people were arrested Saturday night as authorities moved in to clear an Occupy Salt Lake encampment at a downtown park. Police had ordered protesters to leave the park after a man was found dead late Thursday night. The cause of death was thought to be carbon monoxide poisoning and a drug overdose, CNN affiliate KSTU reported. ""We can no longer tolerate individuals camping on our streets,"" Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank told reporters. However, ""only camping is over,"" Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker's office said on Twitter -- protests can continue at the park. KSTU reported authorities said protesters would be allowed to have a 24-hour presence and one building, but the tents had to go. As police moved in Saturday evening, according to video from the scene, protesters chanted, ""This is what a police state looks like."" ""Our rights to assembly, which are embodied in the First Amendment, are still being violated,"" protester Jesse Fruhwirth told KSTU. ""Our forefathers are speaking to us, telling us that this is what assembly looks like. Not being able to camp here severely limits the ability of us to keep our coalition together."" CNN's Ashley Hayes, Brianna Keiler, Elizabeth Cherneff, Miguel Susana, Tenisha Bell and Maria P. White contributed to this report.","Singer performs tune about the Occupy movement at the APEC dinner .

"(CNN) -- Investigators charged a former CIA officer Monday with disclosing classified information to journalists on several occasions. John Kiriakou, a CIA intelligence officer from 1990 to 2004, illegally divulged information about two CIA employees and their involvement in classified operations between 2007 and 2009, the Justice Department said in a statement. In a second case, the Justice Department said, Kiriakou disclosed the name and contact information of a CIA employee who participated in the operation to capture and question Abu Zubayda, who allegedly was al Qaeda's top military strategist until his capture in 2002. Interrogators used the controversial waterboarding technique on Zubayda 83 times in August 2002, according to a government memo released years later by the administration of President Barack Obama. Kiriakou is charged with one count of violating the Intelligence Identities Protection Act ""for allegedly illegally disclosing the identity of a covert officer,"" the Justice Department statement said. He also faces two counts of violating the Espionage Act for ""allegedly illegally disclosing national defense information"" and one count of making false statements to a CIA board that reviews sensitive materials that employees propose to publish publicly. The last charges alleges that he tried ""to trick the CIA into allowing him to include classified information in a book he was seeking to publish,"" the statement said.","John Kiriakou was a CIA intelligence officer from 1990 to 2004 .

"(CNN) -- One of Senegal's most popular musicians Youssou N'Dour has announced his candidacy in February's presidential elections. Speaking on his television network TFM, N'Dour said his motivation to run for president was influenced by what he called ""a supreme patriotic duty to do more for my country."" Indeed, N'Dour is one of Senegal's most popular faces on the international stage, a celebrated musician who has won many awards including a Grammy in 2005. N'Dour will run against current president Abdoulaye Wade, whose bid for a third term is proving controversial. In June last year, thousands of protesters clashed with police capital Dakar after President Wade proposed changes to the constitution that his critics alleged were meant to make it easy for him to win reelection. The proposed changes reduced the percentage of votes need to avoid a runoff from 50% to 25%. West Africa has a history of military coups and civil wars but Senegal is a rare exception. It has never experienced a military coup. However, the rising political tension in the run-up to the February presidential election is cause for worry. Speaking of his candidacy, N'Dour said Senegal deserves better and is prepared to do whatever it takes to ensure that the country does not take the path of violence seen in other countries in the region during election period. ""We have to continue to communicate the message of peace and tolerance and this is what my presidency will advocate if elected"" N'Dour said. Biram Gueye, a Dakar-based political analyst, said while there is no doubt that N'Dour has been a very successful and celebrated musician with large following among young people, it is difficult to guess whether he can galvanize this into political support. ""Political support in Senegal is influenced by not any ideological lineage but rather familiarity with the terrain and experience in the field and this is what Youssou N'Dour lacks,"" he said. In the streets of Dakar, however, opinion is mixed. While some welcome N'Dour's desire to run for the presidency, others are cautious. ""The political arena is like a mine field and I prefer Youssou not to venture into it because if he doesn't win, it could have some dent on his music career,"" said Amet Seck, a university student. Gueye agreed. ""Before, many in Senegal saw Youssou as a neutral unifier through his music. But from now on a section of the society, especially supporters of the ruling party, have began viewing him differently."" But perhaps the most difficult issue for N'Dour's presidential bid is how to deal with a constitutional clause that sets a minimum educational qualification of high school certificate to be able to run as president. N'Dour lacks a formal education. His answer is that the presidency is a function and not a job. ""It's true, I haven't pursued higher education but I have proved my competence, commitment, rigor and efficiency time and time again. I have studied at the school of the world. Travel teaches as much as books,"" he said.","Youssou N'Dour has announced his candidacy for president .
He is a Grammy-winning musician .
But some wonder if his candidacy will hurt his career ."
"Sydney (CNN) -- Security officers dragged Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard out of a Canberra restaurant Thursday after an angry mob of protesters surrounded the building during a luncheon ceremony, police said. Gillard and federal opposition leader Tony Abbott were taken out of the building after a group of between 50 and 100 protesters from a nearby ceremony gathered around the building, bashing windows and brandishing sticks and rocks, according to federal police. The prime minister was presenting medals to emergency service workers during an Australia Day celebration. In a nearby venue, a spontaneous protest erupted with an Aboriginal rights group. The group was commemorating the 40th anniversary of an Aboriginal ""tent embassy."" The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported the protesters were chanting ""shame"" and ""racist"" as they banged on the restaurant's three glass sides. Gillard and Abbott were taken out a side door, the ABC said. At least 50 police were called to help escort them from the restaurant. Local media reported Gillard was visibly shaken, and stumbled during the encounter. Photographs showed her being dragged to a waiting vehicle by a group of at least seven security officers, losing a shoe in the process. Video showed her being hustled into the vehicle, surrounded by security officers, some carrying shields, as protesters shouted, ""Shame on you."" The shoe was collected by protesters, who proclaimed it a trophy. On the tent embassy's Facebook page, according to the ABC, there was a picture of Gillard losing her shoe with the caption: ""What is losing a shoe compared to losing an entire continent?"" Australia's Nine Network captured the conversation inside the restaurant as the two were being escorted out. ""OK, what about Mr. Abbott? Have you got him? We'd better help him through too, hadn't we?"" Gillard asks her security guard after he told her it was not safe to stay much longer. There were no injuries, and no arrests were made, Australian Federal Police said. Video from the ABC showed some minor struggles breaking out between authorities and protesters. As Gillard and Abbott left, the protesters chased her vehicle down the street, banging on its roof, the broadcasting corporation reported. The protesters apparently were angry about remarks made by Abbott earlier Thursday, in which he suggested it may be time to reconsider the tent embassy's relevance. The establishment of the embassy was a symbolic protest against then-Prime Minister Billy McMahon's refusal to acknowledge land rights for indigenous Australians, the ABC said. Over the years, it has been a controversial site and the scene of clashes, the broadcasting corporation said. ""I think the indigenous people of Australia can be very proud of the respect in which they are held by every Australian,"" Abbott said earlier Thursday, according to the ABC. ""But I think a lot has changed since then and I think it probably is time to move on from that."" Activist Sean Gordon told the ABC, ""We have no economic base for who we are as Aboriginal people. We have title to land we aren't able to do anything with. How have we moved on?' Following the incident, Gillard put on a ""brave face"" as she held a function for international ambassadors, the ABC said. ""Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine,"" the prime minister told the network. ""The only thing that really kind of angers me about it is that it disrupted such a wonderful event for great people, emergency services medals, just amazing people."" ""I am made of pretty tough stuff and the police did a great job,"" she said. Last week, an Australian panel suggested changes to the nation's constitution to give better recognition to indigenous Australians, often referred to as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The groups have suffered at the hands of later settlers and the government they established. Australian politicians have since apologized for the past mistreatment, but Aborigines remain disadvantaged socially and economically compared with the overall population. Explicit references to Aborigines in the original Constitution, drafted in the late 19th century, were subsequently deemed to be negative. Australians voted overwhelmingly to remove those points in a 1967 referendum, but many people say the document can be further improved to acknowledge the role of the country's indigenous population. The panel -- which included Aboriginal leaders, business executives, legal experts and members of the main political parties -- handed over its report to Gillard, whose government has promised to hold a referendum on the matter by the next general election.","An angry mob of Aboriginal protesters surrounded a Canberra restaurant .

"(CNN) -- Crashes had whittled the expected field from 22 to five, with wreckage from at least a dozen aircraft at one point strewn about the French airfield. But it did not deter between 300,000 to 500,000 from flocking to the Betheny Plain outside Reims for the final event, drawn by the rush of seeing planes turn, twist and race through the air -- and not deterred by the evident risk. That account, from the U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission, was from 1909. More than 100 years later, air shows -- which may include air races -- continue to draw millions. In the process, they generate $110 million annually in the U.S. and Canada alone, according to John Cudahy, president of the International Council of Air Shows. A spike this year in fatalities at such events has raised fresh questions about safety. But it has not detracted from the enthusiasm of many aviation enthusiasts, who still view such races as enthralling competitions. ""It's exciting, it's incredibly moving to see these airplanes do what they do and handle the way they are,"" said aviation analyst Jim Tilmon, himself a former pilot in the U.S. military and with American Airlines, who then compared it to its risks and thrills with auto racing and other sports. Such danger was apparent Friday, when pilot Jimmy Leeward's P-51 aircraft plunged into spectators during a qualifying run at the National Championship Air Races and Air Show outside Reno, Nevada. Nine people -- including the pilot -- were killed, with many more injured. A day later, U.S. Air National Guard Lt. Nate Nueller said an aircraft crashed at a show in Martinsburg, West Virginia, killing the pilot. Cudahy noted there had been at least 13 deaths at U.S. air shows this year -- after none for 2009 and 2010. Mike Cummings, crew chief for the Blue Thunder racing team, watched Leeward's World War II-era plane fly over his head, invert, go into a loop, then slam into the ground. He called the crash ""very traumatic (for) the very close-knit"" air racing community, be they people such as himself who knew Leeward personally or other enthusiasts worldwide of the sport. Still, he said it would not deter him from continuing to participate. Nor would he hesitate to bring family members, as he has done often in the past, to watch planes race. ""(My kids) love the air races,"" said Cummings. ""They realize it's dangerous, that it's not a Sunday afternoon in the park."" Air races are sometimes a part of, but distinct from, ""air shows,"" which generally are exhibitions in which pilots demonstrate aerobatics and other aerial moves. In a race, pilots compete against one another to see who can go fastest. There are several forms, the most high-profile being the Red Bull Air Race circuit in which competitors race against a clock and do aerobatic maneuvers, before being compared. Its pilots come from around the world -- Japan, Brazil, England and beyond -- oft competing in picturesque locales in front of hundreds of thousands of people, including well over 1 million recently in Dubai. The Reno race, by contrast, was a lap race. Competitors, typically five to eight at a time, fly a predetermined number of laps in large ovals that range from 3 to 8 miles, depending on the type of plane. And the fledgling Sky Challenge racing circuit is a head-to-head race that melds the two concepts while adding various safety measures. CEO Peter Newport said he is currently criss-crossing the globe for meetings to set up future events. Whatever the air race form, Newport said the common challenge is balancing the desire to maximize both excitement and safety. The latter becomes a bigger challenge than with conventional aircraft, since the pilots -- however well-trained -- are trying to push their planes to the limits. Those involved in such events point out the numerous safety checks in place. Only 320 pilots, for instance, are certified to fly in air shows, much less air races, said Cudahy. And the Federal Aviation Administration notes that its employees closely examine a race course, monitor pilots' practice runs, examine their and their planes' safety records and observe the races themselves. This is all in addition to pre-race inspections of the aircraft. Still, as authorities learned again Friday, there are limits to what can be done when pilots are trying to get the most from their aircraft -- especially if there's an unanticipated mechanical failure. ""An air race is a very, very high-speed race close to the ground with aircraft that have been modified to fly much faster than were originally designed to fly,"" Tilmon said. ""You can call this an extreme sport (because the plane and pilot) are being pushed to the absolute edge."" Newport, for one, believes that new technology can make such events safer without losing any of the sport's luster -- something, he said, is needed to encourage more young people to go into aviation. And he thinks that, once the safety questions are answered, air racing should grow even more popular and take its place among conventional sports like baseball, soccer, golf and the like. ""I think air racing will be the world's predominant sport in 10 year's time,"" said Newport, anticipating it could be a huge spectator and revenue draw without heavy expenses such as building stadiums. ""The challenge is (balancing) excitement and safety... Unless you achieve those two things, it's hard to see how it becomes a global sport.""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The decommissioning of four reactors at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant will likely take more than 30 years to complete, according to a report by Japanese officials. The draft report, released by Japan's Atomic Energy Commission of the Cabinet Office on Friday, said the removal of debris -- or nuclear fuel -- should begin by the end of 2021. ""We set a goal to start taking out the debris within a 10-year period, and it is estimated that it would take 30 years or more (after the cold shutdown) to finish decommissioning because the process at Fukushima would be complicated,"" the report states. Last month, the plant's owner -- Tokyo Electric Power Company -- said engineers might be able to complete the cold shutdown of damaged reactors by the end of the year. Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday that operators of the plant ""are now confident that the so-called cold shutdown will be achieved by the end of the year."" Temperatures in the three reactors where meltdowns occurred in the wake of the historic March 11 earthquake and tsunami have already been brought down below 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit), but the company has to maintain those conditions for some time before declaring the reactors in cold shutdown, Tokyo Electric spokesman Yoshikazu Nagai said in October. Experts have said it will take years -- perhaps decades -- to fully clean up the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. Hydrogen explosions blew apart the No. 1 and No. 3 reactor housings, while another hydrogen blast is suspected to have damaged the No. 2 reactor. Fires believed caused by heat from the No. 4 spent fuel pool damaged that unit's reactor building. The atomic energy commission's report noted it took 10 years to remove nuclear fuel after the 1979 Three Mile Island disaster in the United States. The commission predicted removing fuel at Fukushima would require more time, because the extent of the damage was more severe. But the timetable doesn't address plans for dealing with the radiation released into the wider environment from the Fukushima disaster, said Timothy Mousseau, a radiation ecologist at the University of South Carolina. Mousseau told CNN International's ""Prism"" on Wednesday that scientists ""are just now starting to get a handle"" on the amount of radioactive material released by the disaster. ""What's important to realize is there's a very large environmental problem that needs to be addressed head-on,"" he said. ""At the moment, there's very little in the way of scientific research being done to determine what the scope and the time frame will be for dealing with the remediation of these effects in the coming years."" Mousseau said volunteers collecting data around the country are finding ""quite a bit of radiation,"" while contaminated water released into the Pacific will take some time to be fully dispersed and diluted. The plume of radioactive particles that spewed from Fukushima Daiichi displaced about 80,000 people who lived within a 20-kilometer (12.5-mile) radius of the plant, as well as residents of one village as far as 40 kilometers to the northwest. The government has yet to determine when those evacuated can return to their homes. In mid-October, an IAEA team praised the country's efforts to decontaminate the area, but urged Japanese authorities ""to avoid over-conservatism"" in the effort. Japan's main strategy has been to scrape off the top 5 centimeters (2 inches) of topsoil from contaminated areas -- a plan the IAEA found could produce ""huge amounts of residual materials"" -- but it is conducting a variety of tests in different areas, the report concluded. CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Expert says ""a very large environmental problem"" remains beyond the plant .

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- A former member of the Arab League monitoring team in Syria said he resigned from the mission because it is ""providing the regime cover for more killing"" and ""shameful"" brutality. ""I quit because I found myself serving the regime and not part of an independent monitoring body,"" Anwar Malek, an Algerian, told Al-Jazeera in an interview Wednesday. His remarks were translated by CNN. ""I am unable to stop the killing."" The Arab League embarked on a fact-finding mission in Syria in December, part of an initiative to end the bloody 10-month-long crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad's government against peaceful protesters. The League wants the government to stop violence against civilians, free political detainees, remove tanks and weapons from cities and allow outsiders, including the international news media, to travel freely around Syria. The purpose of the mission is to see how the government is adhering to the plan. The Arab League confirmed to CNN that Malek was part of the observer team. Mahmoud Nasser, an Arab League official in Cairo, told CNN that Malek had been sick during his stint and attended only a limited number of field visits. He ""had requested to fly to Paris for medical treatment during the mission. He has excused himself from the mission,"" Nasser said. Malek's comments reflect the position of opposition activists, who regularly report government brutality and document casualties. ""It's practicing the same activities more blatantly,"" Malek said of the Syrian government. ""It's even killing its supporters to convince the Arab monitors that the regime is just doing their job to provide security and to gain sympathy. I felt like I myself would become a government thug, that's why I've quit."" Asked what he witnessed and what led to his resignation, Malek described grisly scenes in Homs, the restive city that has been an epicenter of anti-Assad sentiment. ""Most importantly, the human feeling that I lived over 15 days in Homs; I was in Baba Amr, Khalidya, Bab Sbaa, Sultaniya. I've been to all these areas, I've seen shameful scenes, burnt bodies that had undergone torture, skinned bodies, children murdered, and every now and then we would see someone shot by a sniper. I've seen all of that with my own eyes. I just cannot give up my humanity in the face of that or pretend to be independent or neutral when faced with it,"" he added. Malek said he viewed detention facilities and ""found people in a definitely deplorable and tragic state."" ""People are undergoing systematic torture and starvation, where they are only given one snack a day, although those who underwent severe conditions were secretly transported to other areas, such as military zones or facilities that we know nothing about."" He also claimed that there were ""soldiers and maybe intelligence officers that were presented to us as being prisoners."" Asked how he would know that, Malek said he has ""some experience with prisons."" ""When someone lives in such a place, his odor would be similar to that of the jail cell. Some of those people smelled like women's perfume. Where did that come from?"" Malek was also asked about remarks from the head of the monitors, who had said the situation isn't as bad as Malek said it is. Sudanese Lt. Gen. Mohamed Ahmed Mustapha al-Dabi is heading the observation mission. ""I believe that the head of the monitors wants to hold the stick from the middle, in order not to upset the authority or any other party. He picks his words so not to upset anybody. He always discourages us from speaking to the media so as not to say something that would upset a certain party and hence hinder our work. But the situation is tragic and Baba Amr and all other areas in Homs that I've been to for a while can only be described as an absolute disaster zone. Houses are destroyed after being bombarded by heavy weapons, all signs show that heavy weapons are still there,"" Malek said.

"Key West, Florida (CNN) -- They search the ocean depths hunting for evidence left by predators deadlier than great white sharks. They are members of the FBI's Technical Dive Team, an elite group of special agents tracking terrorism underwater. Starting next year, this 10-member team could be called on to search for evidence left behind by international terrorists in water contaminated by chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear waste. ""There have been enough scenarios recently,"" says team member Supervisory Special Agent James Tullbane, citing the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India, which began when terrorists entered the port city by boat. ""If you look at Mumbai and you look at various international incidents that occurred where there's attacks on American civilians or attacks on American interests where water has been involved, ... we determined that we really do need to expand our capabilities."" A year ago, the FBI created the Technical Dive Team with a primary mission of gathering evidence after a terrorist attack to help find and prosecute those responsible. The team's ability to operate in contaminated water and to dive at extreme depths sets these divers apart from the FBI's existing Underwater Search and Evidence Response Teams. A large part of the Technical Dive Team's training is focused on diving in hazardous materials, Tullbane says. Instead of air tanks, the divers use a hose connected to a surface supply system. ""It not only provides the air, it collects the air that you exhale and brings it back to the surface,"" says Michael Tyms, the team's program manager. The divers also wear specialized dive suits and old-fashioned hard steel helmets so they can safely operate in contaminated water without being exposed to toxins. The new equipment also allows the divers to search a crime scene as deep as 300 feet. A safe recreational dive is about 130 feet. Marine mammals help with counterterrorism . The team, which is halfway through its two-year training program, is scheduled to be fully operational by next year, once all its certifications are complete, Tullbane says. In the meantime, the divers will perform missions they feel they are capable of doing without high risk of injury. A few weeks ago, the team was called to duty after the U.S. Coast Guard asked the FBI for assistance with a case involving a ""narco sub,"" a semi-submersible vessel regularly used to smuggle drugs. When the Coast Guard spotted the vessel off the coast of Honduras, its crew sank the watercraft. They were later detained, according to a Coast Guard press release. ""The thought was, 'Hey, somebody could go down and retrieve those narcotics,'"" says Tyms. ""So they called us and we said, 'Yep that's the type of mission we could do.'"" Armed with their state-of-the-art side sonar and their surface air supply system, the FBI divers headed to the Caribbean and a blighted, contaminated patch of water, ironically close to a prime recreational dive spot, the world's second largest barrier reef. ""Once it sunk, diesel (fuel) was leaking out into the water, into the cargo hold,"" says Tyms. In the cargo hold 80 feet below the surface, the divers found nearly 15,000 pounds of cocaine estimated to be worth $180 million in street value, according to the Coast Guard. The divers went down in pairs. It took eight divers, 15 dives and 24 hours in the water to bring the blocks of tightly packed cocaine to the surface. The FBI dive team played an ""essential"" role in locating and recovering the drugs, according to Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Peter Niles. During their mission, the most dangerous threat to the divers didn't come from the hazardous water or the marathon dive session, Tyms says. ""Our memorable moment was when two divers jumped in the water and a shark came out of nowhere and started swimming around them,"" he says. The team can only hope that a curious shark remains its most dangerous dive encounter.","FBI agents are being trained to search for terrorism clues underwater .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Facebook wants to hear your life story. Not satisfied with just being a repository for recent vacation photos, the company is revamping the profile pages on its website to better highlight the milestones in a person's life, executives announced at its annual conference for software developers on Thursday. This new version is based around the idea of a personal ""timeline"" rather than the standard profile pages that users have become used to. ""We're more than what we did just recently,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in unveiling the new look. ""Timeline is a completely new aesthetic for Facebook."" The pages look more like blogs than a social-networking site. A large photo covers the top of the pages, stretching from one side of the screen to the other. And posts -- like photos, status updates and the locations a person visits -- show up below that, attached to a vertical and chronological timeline. Facebook is hoping the changes encourage people to publish more information about their daily lives and about their pasts. In his onstage demonstration, Zuckerberg posted a baby picture of himself, which showed up at the bottom of his timeline profile. ""We think it's an important next step to help you tell the story of your life,"" he said. Some users got a beta version starting on Thursday, while others will be able to request access. The new profile will be turned on for everyone in the next few months, according to Bret Taylor, Facebook's technology chief. The world's largest social network, with more than 750 million users, introduced some related new features earlier this week. Zuckerberg said Facebook's reach continues to grow. ""For the first time ever, in a single day we had half a billion people use Facebook,"" he said. The company made a second big announcement Thursday when it unveiled a new version of its app network, which also is launching in the coming weeks. Facebook will make it easier for people to post info to their profile pages without visiting the site or clicking a Like button. The company has partnered with dozens of prominent software developers for applications that integrate more closely with the social network. Some of these features launched on Thursday. This is ""the most significant change we've made to our platform since we launched it four years ago,"" Taylor said. Streaming music services, including MOG, Rhapsody, Rdio, Spotify and Turntable.fm, can automatically send data to Facebook about each song a user listens to or about new playlists. These might then show up as a weekly report on the user's Facebook page. Zuckerberg called this ""real-time serendipity."" ""This rings the friction out of how to share music,"" Kenneth Parks, Spotify's content chief, said in an interview. To promote this real-time sharing, Facebook also announced partnerships with Yahoo News, Netflix, Hulu, foodie social network Foodspotting and others. These companies have created Facebook apps that can post all of a person's activities on Facebook's new ""ticker,"" which appears in the top right-hand corner of the site's homepage. Some video services will similarly be able to notify Facebook each time a user watches a video. Hulu, the TV streaming site, and Netflix, the paid subscription service, will be among the first to adopt the new features. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who is also on Facebook's board of directors, said that in some cases, Facebook friend recommendations can trump Netflix's vaunted algorithms. Netflix's Facebook features will be activated in 44 countries but not in the U.S. because of a law that Hastings described as outdated. ""You don't have to Like a movie,"" Zuckerberg said. ""You just watch a movie."" Miscellaneous apps like Nike+ and recipe sites also will be able to send more info about particular runs or dinner concoctions without asking each time. ""I'm not going to publish a status update every time I walk up to my stove,"" said Taylor, the Facebook CTO who is also an avid cook. ""I don't want to spam my friend's news feed every time I pick up a spatula."" News websites and apps will ask readers to sign in with their Facebook accounts so that they can send info to the social network about every article they read. For the news industry, ""it's huge,"" said Eric Vishria, the CEO of RockMelt, which integrated some of these features into its Web browser. ""It gives a more tailored view."" But Flipboard, a news aggregation app for iPad that is listed among Facebook's first partners, decided not to adopt that particular feature because, according to a spokeswoman, users probably wouldn't want to share so much information. Instead, users of the apps will be able to highlight individual articles using the Like button, as they currently can, or also share sections to their profiles, she said. The new Facebook features could anger privacy advocates. With these changes, Facebook is seeking significantly more data about people's activity online and about their personal lives. Some Internet users who were watching Thursday's presentation online reacted negatively. ""Get ready for over-sharing,"" one Twitter user wrote. ""This is just WAY too much sharing. The end of privacy,"" a Facebook user wrote on the company's live stream page. Facebook is hoping to alleviate these concerns during a ""slow rollout,"" Facebook's Taylor said in an interview with reporters after the announcement. The company worked with privacy groups during the development of these features, he said. ""This is actually a major step for transparency and control on Facebook,"" Taylor said. Users will be able to delete individual items after they've been posted, he added. Zuckerberg has said he believes Internet users will continue sharing significantly more of their lives online each year. Comedian Andy Samberg, who opened Thursday's event with his familiar ""Saturday Night Live"" impersonation of the hoodied Facebook founder, poked fun at this idea in a brief introductory routine.","Mark Zuckerberg: ""Timeline is a completely new aesthetic for Facebook""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Los Angeles County judge revoked probation for Lindsay Lohan on Wednesday after reprimanding the actress and her attorney in court for Lohan's failure to comply with her community service. Lohan was removed from the courtroom in handcuffs. She later posted a $100,000 bail and was freed early Wednesday afternoon within two hours of her arrest, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokeswoman said. Under Judge Stephanie Sautner's ruling, once Lohan made bail, the actress must perform 16 hours of community service a week -- over a minimum of two days a week -- at the Los Angeles County morgue before her probation violation hearing November 2. The judge expressed anger at Lohan's repeated probation violations the past several months. Lohan was supposed to be performing community service at a downtown Los Angeles women's center, but the judge said Lohan posted nine excused absences at the center since her last court hearing on July 21 -- and performed, at most, only two hours of service. Lohan's attempt to perform community service at a nearby Red Cross facility was voided Wednesday because the judge said she didn't authorize that change. ""I am revoking her probation,"" the judge said. Sautner said ""Ms. Lohan's decision made it deliberately impossible to perform"" her community service. After the hearing, Lohan publicist Steven Honig released a statement: ""Lindsay is hoping this matter will be resolved on November 2 and the court will reinstate probation and allow her to continue fulfilling her community service."" Lohan's estranged father, Michael Lohan, told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that his daughter needs ""a very, very intensive"" program of rehabilitation for substance abuse. ""What the judge did, she had to do,"" Michael Lohan said. But he said jail time would not be the proper remedy. ""She's not going to be working the morgue. She's going to wind up in a morgue if someone doesn't do something to get her help,"" he said. Lohan was in court Wednesday so the judge could determine whether she made progress on the requirements of her probation from a shoplifting conviction earlier this year. In back-and-forth arguments with defense attorney Shawn Holley before making the ruling, the judge read aloud in court a statement that Lohan had made regarding her unsuccessful community service at a downtown Los Angeles women's center: ""She said she wasn't interacting with anyone, so it wasn't fulfilling."" The judge harshly reprimanded Lohan. ""Is that what it's supposed to be about -- fulfilling? Or is it supposed to be punitive?"" the judge told Lohan's attorney, who was standing beside the actress seated at the defense table. ""Her probation would have been done last year if she had done what she was supposed to do,"" the judge said. ""There has been violation after violation. You have been doing this a long time. I have been doing this a long time. ... Probation is a gift. It's not a right."" ""We all can't be fulfilled by what we do,"" the judge added. Her attorney responded: ""She understands that."" ""There is this rallying cry for more punishment and more jail,"" her attorney said. The judge said, ""I don't care about rallying cries."" ""You haven't shown me between July 21 ... and September 9, how many hours she has done at the downtown women's center. I'm thinking maybe two -- with nine absences,"" the judge said. ""It says she blew them off and left after an hour or an hour and half."" At one point during the hearing, Los Angeles city attorneys Lisa Houle and Melanie Chavira asked the court to revoke Lohan's probation and impose jail time because of Lohan's failure to do the community service. One of the city attorneys charged in court that Lohan ""is in violation for getting herself kicked out of the women's center, which she was ordered to do."" But Lohan's attorney told the court that Lohan received ""a glowing"" probation report, which said that ""Ms. Lohan has reached a turning point"" in her behavior and maturity. The judge raised several questions about the reliability of that report, however. Sautner remarked how the probation report showed Lohan had excused absences from community service between September 9 and October 5 so that Lohan could travel to New York, Milan, and Paris for work. But Lohan's psychologist's report stated that Lohan had perfect attendance every week, the judge observed. ""The psychologist said she appeared in person for her counseling every Tuesday,"" the judge said. ""I don't know how she did that."" ""Did she go to Milan for five days and come back in time or go to Paris for five days and come back in time?"" the judge asked the defense attorney. ""If she was gone from September 9 to October 5, did she get beamed across the pond? I don't know how that happened,"" the judge said. Holley told the judge that she didn't know the specifics of Lohan's psychological appointments, but the attorney said the arrangement did call for telephonic conferences. Holley added that Lohan's work in Europe was done to support her and her family -- and impacted her ability to carry out the community service. ""Because the work is out of the county, it did cause a disruption to her schedule"" to do community service, Holley said. Lohan's community service at the county morgue won't be easy, as participants work eight-hour shifts at a time, the judge noted. ""They don't mess around and you show up and do what they tell you to do,"" Sautner said. In July, a court hearing revealed Lohan was in compliance with her community service, fines and shoplifting counseling requirements, but she had not signed up for the court-ordered psychological counseling. Her lawyer argued at the time that a lapse in Lohan's health insurance -- because she's not been working in the past year -- had prevented her from paying for the psychological counseling. Sautner warned Lohan that she could face jail time if she did not sign up for the counseling in three weeks. Group counseling, which probationers attend, is often free or low-cost, but the judge agreed with her lawyer that her celebrity status made that unworkable. Lohan, 25, pleaded guilty in May to stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. Her legal woes, which began four years ago with two drunk driving arrests, have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes, and alcohol and drug test failures. Her probation is scheduled to end within a year unless Lohan breaks any laws before then. It has been extended several times because of probation violations, including the failed alcohol and drug tests. In June, Lohan failed an alcohol test administered by a probation officer and was ordered to go before the judge for a probation violation hearing. But her attorney convinced the judge the testing requirement had lapsed in February. Earlier this year, the judge ruled that she is now allowed to drink alcohol and is no longer required to take random drug tests.","Lindsay Lohan must now do community service in L.A.

"(CNN) -- As the forests of the East changed this fall into their seasonal reds and oranges, a remarkable migration of birds headed south. About 30 million ducks, cranes and other species cross the U.S.-Canadian border each autumn day. This fall's great migration in the Northern Hemisphere takes place during the waning months of the United Nations' International Year of the Forest. That the migration happens at the end of this public education initiative reminds us why efforts must continue to safeguard the wild places where these winged travelers live. When we stop to appreciate a forest, we usually see only the trees and animals that inhabit a particular section. On the map, each parcel of green appears as a separate entity, and the species that live within it are commonly thought to depend solely upon that particular area. In reality, however, a forest not only harbors its native wildlife, but it also provides a dynamic way station for countless migratory animals. Many birds found in the heart of the United States started their journeys in the great boreal forests of Canada and Alaska. Some, such as the golden eagle, emerge from the rocky cliffs bordering the free-flowing rivers in the Arctic tundra. Once across the border, many boreal birds winter in the temperate woods of the United States, with billions more continuing on to Central America or even beyond. Strikingly, fully 80% of the waterfowl species found in North America breed in Canada's wild forests. But birds aren't the only creatures that depend on these special, wild places. In Canada, the iconic tundra caribou rely on tree lichens for food as they migrate up to 3,100 miles each year within the country's boreal forest. Farther south in the United States, chinook salmon leave the sea where they have spent the majority of their adult life, from roughly two to five years, and begin their final journey to spawn in the cool streams and rivers that run through the forests of California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. In fact, these fish may swim as many as 930 miles in search of the pools and eddys where they were born. If we are to transform the ideals of the International Year of the Forest into action, we must also take such migration needs into account. This vital global resource for traveling wildlife is irreplaceable -- and yet it is vanishing. According to the U.N., forests have disappeared in 25 countries, and another 29 nations have lost more than 90%. In several regions, such as the Amazon, protection efforts have had mixed results. But impressive progress has been made in places where conservation groups, indigenous communities, industry and government leaders work together to protect entire forest ecosystems. Over the past year, Ontario and Quebec have, together, proposed protecting 390 million acres, with half designated as parks and refuges. Here in the United States, the Obama administration recently reaffirmed support for a landmark federal policy that preserves nearly 60 million acres of the country's last wild national forests. And in Western Australia, Premier Colin Barnett called this year for new safeguards in the Kimberley region, that would include the state's biggest interconnected system of marine and terrestrial parks. Such examples are promising for the migratory species that move through these forest ecosystems. Nevertheless, other wildlands across the globe are rapidly disappearing, which means the spirit of cooperation seen in the remarkable accomplishments this year must continue and grow if we are to preserve the vital functions that forests provide for people and the planet. Leaves every autumn fade, but it would be a shame to also let global efforts to protect our last wild places similarly wane, as the International Year of the Forest winds to a close. For the sake of the animals whose lives depend on their movement throughout this blue planet, we need to remember that it must remain a forested green one, too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Wathen.","Thomas Wathen: The Year of the Forest is winding down, but preservation must not .

"(CNN) -- Australia has passed a controversial new law which will see the country's 500 most-polluting companies pay tax on their carbon emissions. The Clean Energy Act was passed by 36 votes to 32 in the Australian Senate on Tuesday and will come into force on July 1 next year. The legislation sees carbon taxed at a fixed price of 23 Australian dollars ($23.7) per ton for three years before moving to flexible pricing in 2015. In a statement on the prime minister's official website, Julia Gillard described the vote as ""history-making"" and ""a major milestone in Australia's efforts to cut carbon pollution and seize the economic and job opportunities of the future."" The legislation, which passed through Australia's House of Representatives by 74 votes to 72 in October, will deliver cuts in carbon pollution of at least 160 million tons a year in 2020, according to Gillard's website. Nine out of 10 households will receive compensation to offset the expected rises in energy bills caused by the legislation, say the government. This will take the form of a mixture of tax cuts and extra family benefits funded in part by the revenues the government collects from the businesses affected. But opposition leader Tony Abbot, a staunch opponent of the legislation, called it ""a betrayal of the Australian people"" adding that three million Australian households will be worse off because of the tax. ""The longer this tax is in place, the worse the consequences for the economy, jobs and families. It will drive up the cost of living, threaten jobs and do nothing for the environment,"" Abbot, leader of the Liberal party in Australia said in a statement on his website. Abbot also pledged to repeal the tax should he win the next general election scheduled to take place in 2013. International mining group Rio Tinto, one of the companies which will be affected by the new law, believes it will hinder the country's competitiveness abroad. ""Australia's minerals sector now faces significant additional costs not faced by competitors. This will inevitably reduce potential investment and jobs growth in Australia, without reducing global emissions,"" David Peever, managing director of Rio Tinto Australia said in a statement earlier this year. But the Australian Greens, whose support ensured Gillard's minority government won the vote, said the new law promised a greener future. ""Voting for a price on pollution is a vote for our ability to make a difference to climate change and provide a healthy, safe future for our kids and grandkids,"" Penny Wright, Australian Greens' Senator for South Australia, said in a statement.","Bill to introduce carbon tax on country's biggest polluters passed by Australian Senate .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson died because Dr. Conrad Murray failed to notice that his patient had stopped breathing while he was hooked up to an IV drip of the surgical anesthetic propofol, an expert anesthesiologist testified Thursday. Dr. Steven Shafer, probably the last witness before the prosecution rests in Dr. Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial, said Murray should have realized Jackson had stopped breathing about 11:45 a.m. on June 25, 2009. ""When you're there, you see it, you know it,"" Shafer said. Phone records and testimony showed that Murray was on the phone with one of his clinics, a patient, and then a girlfriend about the time that Shafer calculated the oxygen in Jackson's lungs became depleted, causing his heart to stop beating. ""Had Conrad Murray been with Michael Jackson during this period of time, he would have seen the slowed breathing and the compromise in the flow of air into Michael Jackson's lungs, and he could have easily turned off the propofol infusion,"" Shafer said. Murray could have then easily cleared Jackson's airways and restored his breathing by lifting his chin, he said. Earlier testimony from paramedics and emergency room doctors said Jackson was clinically dead by the time an ambulance arrived at the pop icon's Los Angeles home nearly a half-hour after Murray realized there was a problem. The last three prosecution experts, all medical experts, focused the Murray trial on the science surrounding Jackson's death, a contrast to earlier testimony from Murray's girlfriends and Jackson employees. After the defense cross-examination of Shafer on Friday afternoon, Murray's lawyers will start calling witnesses, including their own anesthesiology expert. Shafer demonstrated for the jury how he believed Murray set up the propofol infusion by hanging a 100-milliliter vial from a stand with tubing attached that would have led to a catheter port in Jackson's left leg. ""This is the only scenario that I could generate"" that would produce the high level of propofol found Jackson's blood during his autopsy, Shafer said. ""This fits all of the data in this case, and I am not aware of any data that is consistent,"" he said. Shafer examined and ruled out other scenarios, including Jackson injecting himself with propofol or Murray administering a fatal dose with a syringe. Computer model projections could not identify a scenario that would duplicate the high blood levels found, he said. Although Murray told police he used an IV drip to give Jackson propofol on previous nights, the defense contends that he did not use it the day Jackson died. Instead, they say, Murray put Jackson to sleep about 10:40 a.m. with a single injection. Sometime after that, Jackson woke and used a syringe to inject himself, the defense contends, . Shafer said the theory makes no sense. ""People just don't wake up hell bent to grab the next dose in a syringe, draw it up and shove it in their IV again,"" Shafer said. ""It's just a crazy scenario."" The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson's death was caused by a combination of sedatives with the propofol, which Murray admitted in a police interview that he used to help Jackson sleep. The defense contends that Jackson swallowed eight lorazepam tablets, a claim based on testing of lorazepam levels in Jackson's stomach contents. Shafer discredited the defense lab tests, saying a new test showed the equivalent of only ""1/43rd of a tablet"" of the sedative in the stomach. The level of lorazepam in Jackson's blood was far higher than what would be expected based on the dosages Dr. Murray told detectives he gave Jackson in the hours before his death, Shafer said. Murray said he gave Jackson a total of 4 milligrams of lorazepam in two separate doses starting 10 hours before his death. Toxicology results indicated that Jackson was given 40 milligrams -- not four -- in a series of 10 doses, he said. Although the defense recently abandoned the theory that Jackson may have swallowed propofol, the prosecution still worked to use its old theory to discredit Dr. Paul White, the anesthesiologist who will testify soon for the defense. A report prepared by White in March concluded that oral ingestion of propofol could have killed Jackson, but Shafer testified that it ignores the ""first pass effect"" that is taught to first-year medical students. The liver is a ""powerful mechanism"" for filtering propofol from the digestive tract so that only a very small percentage can reach the blood, Shafer said. Shafer cited several studies on rats, mice, piglets, dogs, monkeys and humans that he said proves swallowing propofol would have no effect. ""There was no sedation at anytime following oral consumption of propofol,"" Shafer said, describing the results of research he commissioned on university students in Chile over the summer. The human study was done not only to prepare for the Jackson trial, Shafer said, but also to counter an effort by the Drug Enforcement Agency to consider tighter restrictions on propofol. The drug is not currently a controlled substance, but publicity over the theory that Jackson's death might have been caused by oral ingestion prompted federal regulators to considered a new requirement that ""it to be handled almost like morphine,"" he said. ""Patients will be hurt if it is restricted,"" he said. ""Anesthesiologists have to have ready access."" The new study assures that if the drug is abused, it would be done only with the intravenous route, which only health care providers have, he said. Shafer testified Wednesday that Jackson would be alive now but for 17 ""egregious deviations"" by Murray from the standard of care required of physicians. Murray's use of propofol almost every night for two months to help Jackson sleep was so unusual, there is no documentation on the dangers, Shafer said. ""We are in pharmacological never-neverland here,"" Shafer said, ""something that's only been done to Michael Jackson."" The trial, in its fourth week, is expected to conclude with the start of jury deliberations near the end of next week.","NEW: A doctor demonstrates IV drips he believes killed Michael Jackson .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Steve Jobs has consistently managed to capture the world's attention with his stage events. On Wednesday evening, the world took to the Web to express their condolences about the news of his death. Facebook news feeds filled with links and anecdotes about the impact that technology -- and more specifically, Apple's technology -- had on users' lives. Messages on Twitter and the site's list of trending topics quickly became dominated by phrases such as ""RIP Steve Jobs,"" ""#ThankYouSteve"" and ""iHeaven."" The flood of messages slowed Twitter to a crawl at times or produced error messages saying the site was over capacity. On those sites, many people posted and quoted from Jobs' heartfelt commencement address to Stanford University in 2005, in which he first provided details about his health problems. Many pointed out how promotions for Apple's products on the company's website were replaced with a black-and-white photo of Jobs. Clicking that image, which Apple titled ""hero,"" leads to a page with a company statement and an e-mail address for sending condolences. CNN's iReport is also collecting reactions. Dave Pell, a software developer and technology investor, referenced Jobs' signature stage pitch, saying, ""And one more thing... Thanks."" Celebrities, corporate executive and politicians, including U.S. President Barack Obama, also voiced their opinions on their social networking profiles and on blogs. ""Steve's impact is immeasurable,"" Jay Adelson, a co-founder of Internet infrastructure giant Equinix, wrote on Twitter. ""It's not enough to remember him. We need to live his dreams."" The many websites devoted to Apple rumors and products placed large banners in memory of the company's co-founder. The alternative-culture blog Boing Boing revamped its design in honor of Jobs to resemble retro Macintosh software. Wired painted its front page black, with a shadowed picture of Steve Jobs in the center. Google's co-founders posted statements about Jobs' importance to them personally and to the industry, and underneath the search box on Google.com, the company added: ""Steve Jobs, 1955 - 2011."" Research in Motion, from its BlackBerry Twitter account, called Jobs ""a great visionary and respected competitor."" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called Jobs ""a mentor and a friend."" Twitter, as it struggled under the weight of the discussions about Jobs, provided a rare peek behind the walls of Apple's headquarters. Joe Hewitt, a former Apple developer, tweeted that he spent time with Jobs once for one of his famous product demos. Hewitt said he braced for rudeness, as Jobs has been criticized for, but he described Jobs as kind and energetic. ""His legacy wasn't any specific product,"" Apple's Blake Seely wrote on his Twitter page. ""It's Apple. That's a lot of pressure. We have to rise to it and make all his work worth it."" Apple flew the flags at its Cupertino, California, office at half-staff, and people began to arrive on the campus with flowers, reports said. Several employees posted Twitter messages containing only the Apple logo. ""The air has been sucked from my office at 1 Infinite Loop,"" Erik Lammerding, an Apple manager, wrote on his Twitter page. Twitter's offices in San Francisco were not immune, either. ""So much talk on Twitter of Steve Jobs, but Twitter HQ has been eerily quiet the past few hours save the clicking of keyboards he tailored,"" tweeted Mark Trammel, a Twitter designer. Dick Costolo, the company's CEO who attended Apple's news conference on Tuesday, tweeted that Jobs created a new standard of excellence. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey wrote simply: ""Thank you, Steve.""","Facebook, Twitter, other sites flooded with tributes .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres -- also known as Doctors without Borders -- said Friday the abduction of two of its workers is jeopardizing assistance to refugees in Kenya. The Spanish women were part of the MSF's international staff, officials said. MSF identified the victims as Montserrat Serra, 40, of Girona, and Blanca Thiebaut, 30, of Madrid. They were working as logisticians at the Dadaab camp complex. In a statement, the organization said it has been unable to contact the pair and asked media to respect the privacy of their families. ""We are doing all we can to ensure their safe and swift return,"" said Jose Antonio Bastos, president of MSF in Spain. The attack took place in a new camp known as Ifo 3, an MSF staffer said Thursday. He said the two women as well as their pickup truck were missing. The driver, shot in the neck, was in stable condition at a hospital. He was identified Friday as Mohamed Hassan Borle, 31. MSF has evacuated part of its team working in Dagahaley and Ifo, two of the three refugee camps in Dadaab, the statement said. ""As a consequence, crucial medical activities had to be stopped,"" the statement noted. However, MSF is still maintaining its lifesaving activities."" Dadaab, about 80 kilometers from the Somali border, is the largest refugee complex in the world. It houses thousands of people who have fled war and famine in the Horn of Africa. United Nations staff and international aid workers often travel with armed Kenyan police escorts from their bases to the various camps. They are not allowed, under their regulations, to travel on their own. However, MSF usually operates without a security escort. The medical humanitarian organization delivers emergency aid to people affected by war, epidemics and disasters. A Kenyan driver from Care International was abducted in September in a nearby camp and is still missing. Aid workers have long worried about security in Dadaab, particularly since the refugee processing center at the border has been closed by the Kenyan government for several years. ""Virtually anybody could be arriving in Dadaab,"" a U.N. official said.","Medical charity evacuates parts of its team in two camps in Kenya .

"(CNN) -- Most of us haven't partied with the bunnies at ""The Playboy Club,"" or fought crime like ""Charlie's Angels."" And with the NBC and ABC programs canceled after just a few episodes, we'll never have the chance. But in the time it took for one alphabet network drama to get the axe, another garnered 8 million viewers and a full season pickup. After all, ""Revenge"" is a language we all understand. The modern day ""Count of Monte Cristo"" reels audiences in with characters viewers seem to love -- and love to hate. Not to mention plot twists to die for. Still, the primetime soap doesn't venture into campy territory. Not even while playing with traded identities and crimes of passion. The concept is simple: Amanda Clarke, disguised as Emily Thorne, returns to the Hamptons to take revenge on the people who destroyed her family when she was a little girl. And ""Revenge"" couldn't have come at a better time as far as its network is concerned. With ""Desperate Housewives'"" eighth and final season underway, ABC was fortunate to find a new female-driven drama that so far appears to resonate with viewers. ""Revenge"" even has its own insightful narrator. (Thank you, Mary Alice Young. You can go now.) ""For the truly wronged, real satisfaction can only be found in one of two places: Absolute forgiveness or mortal vindication,"" narrator and protagonist Emily Thorne, played by former ""Brothers and Sisters'"" cast member Emily VanCamp, coos at the beginning of the pilot. Before even making the acquaintance of her victims, she's got the audience on her side. That's not to say everyone is a fan of her narration. With ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" in mind, one HitFix reviewer wrote, ""ABC has an in-house style that says that having your female lead narrate nothingness at the start of every episode is a worthy strategy."" But whether you're a fan of Thorne's philosophical musings or not, the numbers don't lie. About 7.3 million viewers tuned in to ""Revenge"" on Thanksgiving Eve -- better known as the biggest bar night of the year. Now nine episodes in, the series began in a predictable fashion -- with Emily targeting and conquering one victim every week. Each episode even ended with Emily marking a red X over the victim of the hour in a posed photograph of the Hamptons royalty. ""Revenge"" has since taken a more complex turn, with the introduction of new characters, telling flashbacks and plans gone awry -- a change welcomed by some critics. ""The show has wisely realized that it needs to mix it up when it comes to 'revenging,' and it's also fruitful to have plans backfire and have unexpected complications emerge,"" AOL TV critic Maureen Ryan wrote in her column, ""Stay Tuned."" One complication being antagonist Victoria Grayson, played brilliantly by Madeleine Stowe. Let's just say Emily isn't the only character seeking revenge. The perfect present day villain, Victoria is out to get her son's new love interest, her daughter's inept boy toy, her unfaithful husband and the frenemy who led him astray. ""I can believe that this person would be doing these things,"" Stowe told the Sioux City Journal. ""It's easy for me to slide into her."" As if Stowe and VanCamp weren't enough of a sell, the show's portrayal of the Hamptons royalty might be. ""We are dealing at a particular time right now in American history where I think the average American is going to want to see the takedown of the rich,"" Stowe said. Nothing like a show about rich people who hate their lives to keep one entertained during a recession.","Modern day ""Count of Monte Cristo"" reels audiences in with love/hate characters .

"(CNN) -- Bernard Hopkins first became a world champion 16 years ago and, aged 46, the American boxer made history in May when he was awarded a points victory over Canadian Jean Pascal to become the sport's oldest-ever holder of a global belt. The World Boxing Council (WBC) light heavyweight champion surpassed the record held by compatriot George Foreman with his win in Montreal, with Hopkins set to become the oldest pugilist to defend a world title if he defeats Chad Dawson on Saturday. If Hopkins emerges victorious at the Staples Center in Los Angeles it would mark the latest achievement in a career which has seen the veteran overcome adversity to reach the top of his sport. ""I love what I do,"" Hopkins told CNN. ""I love to work out, I love to win and I'm going to take advantage of it until I can't do it no more. ""It means a lot that I'm in the history books again ... also it sets up for what comes next. Obviously this Saturday with Chad Dawson ... also becoming the second-oldest fighter to be fighter of the year."" Unsurprisingly, Hopkins is significantly older than his opponent this weekend. Dawson, currently ranked by Ring Magazine as the fourth-best light heavyweight in the world, is 29, 17-years younger than the Pennsylvania-born Hopkins. ""29-years-old, as we've seen with Jean Pascal, as we've seen with Kelly Pavlik, as we've seen with most of the guys I've fought that are younger than me at least by 15 years. ""If it's just age, if it's just height. If it's just things that have nothing to do with the IQ ... That's not enough to beat Bernard Hopkins. ""And I mean that. I mean that with confidence and I don't mean that with just promoting. I mean that ... because of how I've been disciplined over these years to train and live and think that way."" But despite his age, Hopkins will not be the oldest fighter on the card in California on Saturday. That honor will belong to Dewey Bozella. The 52-year-old cruiserweight who will be making his debut as a professional boxer in a four-round cruiserweight bout against Larry Hopkins, no relation to Bernard Hopkins, but that is only half of his incredible story. Bozella spent 26 years in New York's Sing Sing prison after being found guilty of murder in 1983, before having his conviction overturned two years ago. During his incarceration, Bozella focused on boxing an was even crowned the Sing Sing heavyweight champion. His story is one which resonates with Hopkins, who served a five-year stretch in Graterford Prison, Pennsylvania between 1983 and 1988. So impressed was Hopkins with Bozella that he has been training with the newcomer ahead of his much-anticipated fight. ""It inspired me,"" said Hopkins of Bozell. ""He chose to do what he did, and not only did he get freedom, but he got humanity. An opportunity to do something that was taken from him years and years ago. To be on a major, major fight card. ""And now that we became, I can say friends, and have understanding about that dark place that I put myself in, you know, I wasn't innocent. But we still understand that dark place. Everybody has a story, but his is beyond a story.""","Bernard Hopkins is the oldest world champion in boxing's history .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have obtained a search warrant for the home where a missing 11-month-old Missouri girl was reportedly last seen, Kansas City police said Tuesday. The warrant allows investigators to comb the house in the coming days and also bars the family of Lisa Irwin from returning home. A patrol car has been posted outside. Lisa was reported missing at 4 a.m. October 4, after Lisa's father, Jeremy Irwin, came home from work to find the door unlocked, lights on and a window that had been tampered with. Lisa's mother, Deborah Bradley, said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the night before. The developments came as a potentially promising lead in the case turned out to be a false alarm. The Riley County Police Department received a report Tuesday that ""Baby Lisa"" may have been sighted in Manhattan, Kansas -- more 100 miles west of Kansas City. A baby with two ""suspicious"" looking women were reportedly seen in a local deli. Authorities were able to ""confirm that the child seen was not the child missing from Kansas City,"" police said. Earlier in the week, Bradley said in an NBC interview she was drunk the night the infant disappeared and that she had last seen the baby about four hours earlier than initially reported. Bradley told NBC she is afraid she will be arrested. Police have accused her of killing Lisa, she said, and told her that she failed a lie detector test. ""I was the last one with her,"" a tearful Bradley said in the interview. ""And from judging on how the questioning went, that's kind of a fear that I have. And the main fear with that is, if they arrest me, people are going to stop looking for her. And then I'll never see her again, and I'll never know what happened."" Asked how much she had been drinking that night, Bradley said, ""enough to be drunk."" But she rejected the notion that she could have harmed her daughter while under the influence of alcohol. ""No, no, no,"" she told NBC. ""And if I thought there was a chance, I'd say it. No. No. I don't think alcohol changes a person enough to do something like that."" Asked whether he had questions about Bradley, Jeremy Irwin told NBC, ""No. There's no question to be had there. I know who she is. I know the kind of mother she is."" Irwin said it's possible someone could have entered the house without Bradley hearing, as the couple's bedroom is on the opposite corner of the house from Lisa's room and Bradley sleeps with a fan at high speed. Lisa is described as being 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blond hair, according to police. She weighs between 26 and 30 pounds and was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it. The missing girl has two bottom teeth and a ""beauty mark"" on her right outer thigh, police said. At the time of her disappearance, she had a cold with a cough.

"(CNN) -- For years, Germany has been feted as the strong man of Europe: While those around it battled years of boom-and-bust, Germany, stable and consistent, thrived. Its economy -- and the economic management of its leaders -- was frequently cited as an example to the rest of the world. But in recent years, that very stability has come to threaten the country, by forcing it to take a leading role in the bailouts of its less economically healthy neighbors, pledging to protect them from sinking under the weight of their debts. Despite being seen as vital for the survival of the euro, Germany's actions have been greeted with anger and frustration at home. A Bloomberg/YouGov poll published on Tuesday found that just 15% of Germans questioned approved of their government's performance during the euro crisis, while 75% disapproved. Concern about what the bailouts will mean for the eurozone has proved contagious, tarnishing not just the economies, but the individuals involved -- and German Chancellor Angela Merkel is no exception. Merkel and Sarkozy huddle as euro struggles . Frequently dubbed Germany's ""Iron Lady"" and hailed as the country's answer to former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the euro crisis has now left Merkel's image looking decidedly rusty. Merkel, 57, the daughter of a Protestant minister, was brought up in then-Communist East Germany. She trained as a chemist before turning to politics as a member of the conservative, right-wing Christian Democrats (CDU). She was elected as chancellor -- the first woman to hold the post -- in 2005, 15 years after she entered parliament. She was re-elected in 2009, but recent polls suggest she may struggle to secure a third term. A survey by German television channel ARD earlier this month recorded a drop in Merkel's approval ratings -- just 45% of those polled said they were satisfied with her work, a slide of four points compared with the previous month. The same poll appeared to predict a grim future for Merkel's CDU/CSU, with support for the party slipping to 36%, compared to the 51% who backed likely coalition partners, the Social Democratic Party and the Greens. And there was further bad news for Merkel, with her coalition partners, the Free Democrats (FDP), notching up just 4% support in the survey -- a result that, were it to be repeated in real elections, would see them fall below the minimum vote threshold, and lose their place in parliament. The FDP has already threatened to withdraw their support for the coalition if Merkel and the CDU back controversial euro bonds as a potential solution to the European debt crisis -- a move that could bring down the government. In March this year, the CDU lost control of the prosperous southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg, which it had governed ever since the 1950s. And with more elections to come later this year, in Berlin and the northern state of Mecklenberg-Western Pomerania, many CDU members fear the euro crisis could yet do further damage to the party -- and its embattled leader. As Germany's conservative Die Welt newspaper recently pointed out in an editorial, ""it is possible the next election may even hinge on this issue."" ""For Merkel, it is both a curse and a blessing. Like her one-time mentor Helmut Kohl, it would provide her the chance to go down in history as a great European. At the same time, she runs the risk of what happened to her predecessor, Gerhard Schröder. [Who] did the right thing economically -- but was then voted out of office."" The latest financial figures mean Merkel and her party can no longer rely on the strength of the economy to see them through. On Tuesday, Germany announced its GDP for the second quarter of 2011 had virtually flatlined, growing by just 0.1% (compared to 1.3% growth in the first quarter of the year). German slowdown adds to eurozone crisis . There may be trouble ahead for Merkel, and for Germany as a whole, but the country's years of stability should allow it to weather the storm more easily than some of its neighbors. And while the euro crisis has dented the chancellor's image, the Bloomberg/YouGov poll suggests that most German hostility over the situation is directed towards Greece. Of those Germans questioned in the survey, 59% were firmly opposed to further bailouts (with just 20% supporting them), and 58% backed the idea of booting Greece out of the eurozone.","Euro crisis has hit German Chancellor Angela Merkel's popularity ratings .

"(CNN) -- A preliminary investigation is under way into an altercation that left a high school football coach hospitalized with severe facial injuries after a Georgia football game, a sheriff's investigator told CNN on Tuesday. Inspector Ricky Brown of the Hancock County Sheriff's Department said initial interviews are being conducted into the incident, which occurred Friday night in Sparta between players from Hancock Central and Warren County high schools. Warren County head coach David Daniel was released Monday from an Augusta hospital after surgery to repair broken bones around his right eye, cheek and nose, said Warren County Superintendent Jean Carey. She told CNN he suffered crushed facial and ear bones and an irreparable injury to one of his tear ducts. Carey said Daniel was struck on the side of his head by a helmet when he tried to intervene in the fight, which occurred after Warren County, the visiting team, defeated Hancock Central 21-2. Carey said Hancock Central players attacked Warren County players as they were trying to get into their locker room, which was locked. Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead told CNN that Carey had contacted the regional investigative office in Thomson, which covers Warren County, asking that the state agency investigate. ""However, the incident venue is in Hancock County, not Warren County and, under Georgia law a school superintendent cannot initiate a GBI investigation,"" Bankhead said. ""That request would have to come from the Hancock County Sheriff's Office, who is investigating this incident,"" Bankhead said. Carey told CNN that Daniel ""wants to come back to school and focus on (this Friday's) game right now. But he's got to take care of himself first."" She added, ""All of Warrenton is just real upset."" Daniel was promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach the week of the first game this season, after Marleau Blount, a Warren County alumnus, resigned under pressure for having practices with players who had not completed physicals. Blount is now Hancock Central's defensive coordinator. ""It was real unfortunate,"" Blount told the Augusta Chronicle. ""I'm upset at everything."" Sporting events between the schools have been canceled for the rest of the academic year, the Warren County superintendent said. The two schools, which are about 25 miles apart in east-central Georgia, west of Augusta, are members of the same conference.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Over four decades in power in Libya, Moammar Gadhafi portrayed himself as a revolutionary battling Western colonialism, the leader of a united Africa and the ""king of kings"" of his oil-rich desert nation and beyond. He died a fugitive in his hometown, hunted down Thursday by the forces that toppled his iron-fisted rule two months ago. His death was cheered by throngs of his countrymen in Tripoli, who let loose with celebratory gunfire and the honking of horns at the news. Gadhafi's death puts an end to the career of the strongman who came to power in a bloodless coup against King Idris in 1969. The 27-year-old army captain soon adopted the rank of colonel, by which he was known for most of his career. He had a gathering of tribal leaders declare him ""king of kings"" of Africa in 2008, but the title never quite caught on. He cut a flamboyant figure in comic-opera military uniforms or tribal robes that played up his Bedouin roots. He sported trademark sunglasses, surrounded himself with an eye-catching female security detail. On a 2009 visit to Italy, he invited 200 models to his ambassador's house, paying each $75 to listen to lectures on Islam and giving each a copy of the Quran. Saad Djebbar, a former legal adviser to the Libyan government, said Gadhafi's mercurial public image was a calculated ploy, aimed at appearing foolish or mad. But as the ""Arab Spring"" revolts erupted in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt, toppling long-serving authoritarian leaders, Gadhafi ""was completely out of touch of the realities of the new world around him,"" Djebbar said. Upon assuming power, he fashioned himself as an Arab nationalist. The United States tried to work with him at first but quickly found out that his brand of nationalism included opposition to the West. By 1972, he was urging Muslims to fight Western powers. He backed American black militant groups and supplied arms to Palestinian factions battling Israel, as well as to Irish Republican Army fighters battling British rule over Northern Ireland. His ""Green Book,"" first published in 1975, envisioned a radically simple system of ""People's Conferences"" that would replace political structures from tribes to parliaments. But Oliver Miles, a former British ambassador to Libya, said the effect of Gadhafi's rule was to leave himself as the nation's sole authority. ""He has destroyed every institution in the country,"" Miles told CNN. ""There is no real civil society in Libya."" Gadhafi said he wanted to unite the Arab world, and even proclaimed a merger of Egypt, Libya and Syria in 1972. That merger plan fell apart, as did a later attempt at a union with Tunisia. Arab leaders largely shunned him, seeing him more as a ""buffoon"" and a ""clown"" than a potential regional leader, said Dirk J. Vandewalle, a Libya expert at Dartmouth University. That rejection from Arab and African leaders, combined with his growing anti-Western sentiment, left him to turn to terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s, Vandewalle said. In 1986, Libya was implicated in the fatal bombing at a West Berlin nightclub that left one American service member dead, prompting U.S. President Ronald Reagan to dub the Libyan leader the ""mad dog of the Middle East."" Reagan ordered the United States to bomb Libya and imposed economic sanctions against the North African country. Two years later, Libya was implicated in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which killed 270 people when it exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland. Years later, Gadhafi appeared to moderate and seek rapprochement with the West. In 1999, he turned over suspects in the Lockerbie bombing, and in 2003 the country agreed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. Those moves paved the way for the lifting of economic sanctions, the restoration of diplomatic relations with Washington in 2006 and Libya's removal from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism the following year. In the years before the current rebellion started, Gadhafi even hired a public relations firm to burnish his global image as a statesman and a reformer. Starting in 2006, the leader spent about $3 million a year to execute a public relations strategy that included paying think-tank analysts and former government officials to take a free trip to Libya for lectures, discussions and personal meetings with Gadhafi. Then-U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met with Gadhafi in 2008 and ""thought he was serious"" about Libya's turnabout. ""He said at one point it has taken too long, that the lessons of history had to be learned,"" Rice later said. In 2009, Gadhafi became chairman of the African Union, aiming to turn the now-54-member organization into a group of ""African united states."" He had been working to build his influence in the region for decades, building a gleaming mosque in Niger's capital, Niamey, in the 1970s and another popular mosque in Bamako, the capital of neighboring Mali. Gadhafi also poured money into Chad and Burkina Faso as well. He addressed the U.N. General Assembly for the first and only time in 2009. In his 96-minute ramble, he denounced the U.N. Security Council as a ""terror council,"" suggested the H1N1 swine-flu virus was a military tool and called for renewed investigations into the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. But critics called his plans for a united Africa impractical, and he lost his bid for a second term as AU chairman in 2010. The bell began to toll for Gadhafi in February after people around the Middle East and North Africa started challenging their leaders in the so-called Arab Spring movement. Gadhafi found himself a target following the ouster of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, whom the Libyan leader had supported, as anti-government demonstrations began. The eastern city of Benghazi fell to rebel forces swiftly as Gadhafi blamed outsiders and ""armed gangs"" for the violence. He told his people the United States was giving young Libyans ""hallucination pills"" to fuel the revolt. He vowed never to leave Libya and to ""die as a martyr at the end."" But his reputation and his fate were largely sealed by his crackdown on protesters and attacks against rebels and civilians alike. The rebels were soon backed by NATO airstrikes, launched in March under a Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians from reprisals. Over the summer, revolutionary fighters edged closer to Tripoli, cutting off key supply routes for Gadhafi's remaining forces. By August 21, they had broken through into the capital; two days later, they ransacked Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound. Members of his family, including his wife and three grown children, soon decamped to Algeria. The ""king of kings"" remained behind, broadcasting occasional defiant messages by radio and television to his shrinking band of followers. ""All along, he was telling them that he is in a safe place and that he is going to bring them back to power,"" former aide Abubaker Saad told CNN. ""For the past few months, that's basically the message that he was sending. But, of course, in reality, he was hiding and running for his life.""

"(CNN) -- The search continued Monday in suburban Seattle for a 2-year-old boy who police said went missing after being left alone in a car by his mother the previous day. The Bellevue (Washington) Police Department acknowledged Monday, in a statement, that ""there are still many unanswered questions."" It said that no arrests have been made and both parents of the child, named Sky Metalwala, are cooperating. ""We have received consent from the mother to search the vehicle and also her home in Redmond,"" police spokeswoman Carla Iafrate told reporters Monday. ""We're currently searching the area around her home in Redmond with several officers out there and FBI agents."" According to police, the boy's mother said she ran out of gas in Bellevue, which is just east of Seattle, leaving the toddler in the car while she took her 4-year-old with her to get help. The mother said the young boy was gone when she returned to the vehicle, about an hour later, police said. Sky has brown eyes and dark, closely cut hair, and was wearing a dark green hooded sweatshirt and blue-and-gray striped pants when he was last seen. Authorities placed automated calls to people in the area after the boy was reported missing, urging people to call 911 if they spotted him. King County Search and Rescue began looking for the child before suspending their ground search Sunday evening, according to a post on the Bellevue Police Department's Facebook page. The investigation resumed Monday, including a search around where the child lived in Redmond, which is to the northeast of Bellevue.

"(CNN) -- After months of grinding civil war, with supporters of Moammar Gadhafi slowly yielding territory to anti-Gadhafi rebels, the final battle for Libya's liberation unleashed an apparent bloodbath. Gadhafi was killed after being captured last week, and the circumstances of his death remain unclear. Human Rights Watch says dozens of apparent reprisal killings also occurred on both sides. Such violence can be common in the aftermath of a long dictatorship, when desired and even cathartic revenge against oppressors competes with efforts to establish the rule of law and stability. Is the mayhem committed with seeming impunity an unavoidable result of revolution, or does it reveal inherent instability in a society damaged by decades of unjust, corrupt and oppressive rule? To Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Saban Center for Middle East Policy, the answer comes from China's communist revolutionary leader, Mao Tse-tung, who is quoted as having said: ""A revolution is not a tea party."" ""The aftermath of a very brutal dictatorship is usually very ugly,"" Riedel said Tuesday. ""Of course, it would have been better if Mr. Gadhafi was put before a trial and held accountable for all his crimes. ... I think it's unrealistic to expect that's going to happen."" In the chaos of a firefight surrounding the capture of such a despised tyrant, it's not surprising that an enemy -- perhaps someone whose family suffered at the hands of the Gadhafi regime -- might have decided to kill him, Riedel added. ""It's not going to be a moment to read them their Miranda rights,"" he said. Gadhafi and son buried in secret location . Human Rights Watch has called for Libya's governing National Transitional Council to investigate the killing of Gadhafi and others, including 53 people found dead and perhaps summarily executed in a hotel under the control of anti-Gadhafi forces. Such violence constitutes a war crime, the group said. ""A failure by the NTC to investigate these deaths promptly and impartially, along with the many alleged war crimes by Gaddafi forces, would send a dangerous message that Libyans can take justice into their own hands,"" said an HRW statement. In a statement, the NTC's executive office said Tuesday that it ""attaches great importance to the concerted efforts deployed to ensure humane treatment, in accordance with the principles of international human rights covenants, to all Libyan and foreign prisoners and detainees. Under the supervision of the Ministry of Justice all cases and detention conditions will be considered and reviewed; fair trials will be guaranteed for those suspected of committing war crimes or criminal acts."" Opinion: U.S enters Libya, leaves Iraq . It said it had coordinated with the High Security Council, which oversees security units, ""to ensure all prisoners and detainees are well treated until they are brought before the judicial authorities."" ""We do not tolerate, and in fact we disapprove of any prisoner being hurt, let alone killed,"" the NTC said in a statement. ""We did not want to end this tyrant's life before he was brought to court, and before he answered questions that have deprived Libyans from sleep and tormented them for years."" History shows that in a revolution, the victor reaps the spoils, including revenge against those formerly in power. The French Revolution had the guillotine, while modern-day despots have met less ritualized but equally inglorious ends. In Afghanistan, the former Soviet-backed leader Najibullah was tortured, killed and publicly hanged when the Taliban came to power in 1996. Another Soviet-era dictator, Nicolae Ceaucescu of Romania, was executed after a very quick trial on Christmas Day in 1989. Saddam Hussein, who was captured by U.S. forces in 2003, stood trial under Iraq's justice system and was hanged three years later, while former Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic died in the custody of the International Criminal Court. Opinion: Investigate Gadhafi's death as a war crime . Other dictators, including Mobutu Sese Seko of the former Zaire and Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia, managed to flee into exile. To Riedel, the killing of Gadhafi sends a message to autocratic rulers such as President Bashar al-Assad of Syria that ""the day of reckoning will come, and when the day of reckoning comes, you'd better have your tickets for a plane to exile."" Violence at the hands of the former Libyan rebels, now in power under the National Transitional Council, should not come as a surprise to anyone, he said. ""I find it a little disingenuous for some to be saying, 'We thought these guys were the good guys,' "" Riedel said. ""How did you expect this was going to end?"" Ibrahim Sharqieh, deputy director of the Brookings Doha Center, noted in an October 6 column that the brutality of the Gadhafi years means ""Libyans will likely find themselves using retributive justice against certain members of the regime, particularly against those who were involved in the killing of innocent civilians."" ""This will be difficult to avoid,"" Sharqieh wrote after the regime was toppled but before Gadhafi's capture and killing effectively ended the fighting. ""Libyans are likely to want to pursue this path for the cathartic psychological impact it would have on the grieving families of the regime's victims and the society in general."" While such retribution ""may provide some psychological release to victims, Libyans must realize that this is not the type of justice that will help their country move into a new era of stability, reconstruction and development,"" Sharqieh added. ""Indeed, Libyans need to engage in a wide national reconciliation process that uses restorative, rather than retributive, tactics to repair broken relationships and heal deep wounds,"" he wrote. Riedel rejected any suggestion that NATO forces or the United States, which spearheaded a military mission to ground Libya's air force and attack government forces, bore responsibility for the extra-judicial killing of Gadhafi after his capture. President Barack Obama's decision to limit U.S. engagement and reject putting ""boots on the ground"" prevented any chance that foreign forces could control the situation, he said. ""I'm glad we didn't have boots on the ground,"" Riedel added. ""If one of the prices of that is we had no control over the last moments of Moammar Gadhafi, I think we were better off not having boots on the ground."" Former CIA Director Michael Hayden, a retired general who contributes to CNN, called for U.S. engagement with the newly liberated Libya to prevent a societal collapse in the aftermath of the Gadhafi regime. ""If Libya is left to its own devices, it is not difficult to conceive of it becoming Somalia on the Mediterranean, an ungoverned space threatening the heart of Europe as well as critical international lines of communication,"" Hayden wrote in a column published Tuesday.","Human Rights Watch calls for investigations of apparent reprisal killings .

"(CNN) -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic was again on target as AC Milan returned to the top of Italy's Serie A with a 2-0 victory at Cagliari on Tuesday. Francesco Pisano's early own-goal and a second-half strike from the in-form Ibrahimovic put the defending champions one point clear of unbeaten Juventus, who visit third-placed Udinese on Wednesday. Massimiliano Allegri's team took the lead in the fourth minute when Pisano deflected Antonio Nocerino's effort into the net after Ibrahimovic sent Robinho free down the right. Ibrahimovic and Nocerino both scored in Saturday's win over Siena which briefly put Milan above Juve, and the Sweden striker continued his rich scoring run in the 60th minute.

"(CNN) -- A football fan has been arrested after a bizarre attack on a team's goalkeeper which forced Wednesday's Dutch Cup match between Ajax and AZ Alkmaar to be called off before halftime.

Referee Bas Nijhuis ended the match prematurely, with Ajax leading 1-0, after Alkmaar coach Gertjan Verbeek took his players off the field. ""This was a terrible incident and we deeply regret it and offer our sincere apologies,"" Ajax's financial director Jeroen Slop told the Amsterdam club's website. ""The supporter has been handed over to the police. It was a 19-year-old man who was probably under the influence of alcohol. He said he hated the AZ goalkeeper and had therefore attacked him.""

"(CNN) -- Thierry Henry made a sensational scoring return for English club Arsenal as his goal sealed a 1-0 win over Leeds United in the third round of the FA Cup. The French striker came on as a substitute and sealed the match with a trademark finish after less than ten minutes on the pitch to enhance his legend at the London club still further. Arsenal's highest ever scorer left the club for Spanish side Barcelona in 2007 and was making his first appearance since sealing a two-month loan move from Major League Soccer side the New York Red Bulls. The 34-year-old received a huge ovation when he came on a replacement for Moroccan forward Marouane Chamakh in the 68th minute and he found the net ten minutes later. Who are football's top January transfer targets? He finished emphatically past Leeds goalkeeper Andy Lonergan to send the Emirates Stadium into raptures and register his 227th goal for the club. It sent Arsenal through to the fourth round at the expense of Leeds, who play in the second tier of English football. Arsenal will now face fellow Premier League side Aston Villa in the next round.

""With one opportunity, it's very important -- you don't know if you'll have a second. You have to make sure you take it. I took it well."" Henry's goal was his 12th in 12 games against Leeds United, who were relegated from the Premier League in 2004. ""I didn't even think about that but I think I will always remember tonight,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini has ruled out the possibility of Carlos Tevez departing on loan, hours after AC Milan announced plans to discuss a possible move for the Argentina striker. Milan want an initial loan deal with a view to a post-season transfer, but Mancini warned the Italian champions ahead of Thursday's planned meeting that the 27-year-old will only leave the English Premier League leaders if a permanent deal can be agreed. ""I hope we can find a good solution for us and Carlos,'' Mancini, who guided Milan's archrivals Inter to three successive Serie A titles, told reporters on Tuesday. ""We want Carlos to come back and play football, and the best solution for us is to sell him. ""Milan know we can't put him on loan but if they want to buy Carlos, for us it is OK."" Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani said a deal is unlikely to be wrapped up before the seven-time European champions leave for a mid-season training camp in Dubai on December 29. ""Thursday we have a meeting with Manchester City about Tevez, but will probably not be the decisive one to conclude the negotiations,"" Galliani told Milan's official website. ""It will be almost impossible to take him to Dubai with the rest of the team. With Manchester City we have a long way to go, at the moment."" Mancini said City could not continue allowing to let highly-paid players go out on loan, which has happened with strikers such as Emmanuel Adebayor, Roque Santa Cruz and -- until he joined Liverpool on a free transfer in August -- Craig Bellamy. ""When Manchester City buy a player, they have to pay a lot of money. But when we want to sell them, they have to go on loan. It is not good for the club and it is not correct for the other players,"" he said. ""Manchester City paid Carlos a lot of money three years ago. It is correct that if one club -- it could be Milan, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain -- they pay Carlos for his value. This is correct."" Silva strike leaves Manchester City clear at the top . Tevez was fined by City for refusing to warm up when he was an unused substitute in a European Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich in September. The former Manchester United forward has been consistently linked with a move away from the Etihad Stadium after handing in a transfer request in December 2010. Tevez looked to be heading back to former club Corinthians -- where he spent two years between 2004 and 2006 -- but the Brazilian club pulled out of the deal in July. The Buenos Aires native has not played for City since September's domestic cup victory over second division Birmingham City and has made just three league appearances for the team he captained last season. Meanwhile, former France striker David Trezeguet is on the verge of sealing a switch to Argentine team River Plate. River's official website confirmed the 34-year-old has passed a medical and will officially join the Buenos Aires club on January 4. The former Juventus and Monaco forward has been playing for Baniyas in the United Arab Emirates since leaving Spanish club Hercules in August. Trezeguet has enjoyed a glittering career, winning the World Cup with France in 1998 before scoring the winning goal for his country in the final of Euro 2000 against Italy. The 33-time national champions have endured a torrid time in recent seasons, culminating in their relegation from Argentina's top flight in June.","Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini rules out Carlos Tevez leaving on loan .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan moved closer to a Champions League place after crushing Parma 5-0 on Saturday following fourth-placed Lazio's shock 4-0 defeat by Siena. Claudio Ranieri's team closed to within a point of the Rome side after 17 games as Italy's Serie A program resumed following a winter break. The win left Inter five points behind defending champions AC Milan and second-placed Juventus, who travel to mid-table Atalanta and bottom side Lecce respectively on Sunday. Inter have been linked with a move for Carlos Tevez, who is widely expected to join local rivals Milan, but it was the Manchester City striker's fellow Argentine Diego Milito who hit the headlines with a first-half double at the San Siro. Who will be January's top transfer targets? Milito has failed to maintain the heights that saw him score both goals in the final of Europe's premier club competition in 2010, but the 32-year-old highlighted his value with a 13th-minute opener from compatriot Ricardo Alvarez's cross. Midfielder Thiago Motta made it 2-0 with a low shot from distance five minutes later, and Milito headed his seventh goal in all competitions this season from Maicon's cross just before halftime. Milito set up strike partner Giampaolo Pazzini in the 56th minute, and the South American's 76th-minute replacement Marcoo Faraoni sealed Inter's biggest win this season with his first touch of the ball, as the 20-year-old fired in a volley off the crossbar for his first goal in Serie A. It is the first time Inter have won five league matches in a row since Jose Mourinho departed in May 2010, and continues the club's resurgent form after a poor start to this season. The defeat left Parma in 13th, and followed 4-1 defeats by Juve and Milan earlier this season. Title hopefuls Lazio could have moved up to third place above Udinese, but went 3-0 down by halftime against Siena after goalkeeper Albano Bizzarri was sent off. Young striker Mattia Destro gave the Tuscany side the lead after only 11 minutes, and Emanuele Calaio doubled the lead on 35 with his first penalty after Franco Brienza went down in the box. Destro put the ball in the net just before the break, but the referee had already awarded a penalty after Bizzarri made contact with the 20-year-old -- and substitute keeper Juan Pablo Carrizo's first job was to retrieve Calaio's spot-kick from the back of the net. Destro, on loan from Genoa, sealed victory with nine minutes to play, heading in Cristiano Del Grosso's cross for his fifth Serie A goal this season as Siena moved up to 14th -- six points above the bottom three.","Diego Milito scores twice as Inter Milan beat Parma 5-0 at the San Siro on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson signaled his intention to stay at the English Premier League champions for at least three more years but struggling Blackburn wrecked his 70th birthday celebrations with a stunning 3-2 win at Old Trafford Saturday. Ferguson marked 25 years in charge of the English Premier League champions earlier this year, but his ambition clearly still burns bright. ""I think I've got three years at the club,"" Ferguson told the official club website. ""As long as my health stays up, and as long as I'm still enjoying it and still getting the satisfaction of the team doing its best,"" he added. Ferguson's top moments in 25 years in charge .

""We have to continue the dominance of winning leagues and, without question, winning a European Cup is important at this club. We should have been in at least another three finals. But you can't be greedy, I suppose, and having won two in my time is an achievement. ""They were special, it was terrific to win them. I think I'd be very keen to do that (again).""

With Ferguson resting Wayne Rooney and other first team regulars, their Lancastrian neighbors led 1-0 at half time through an Ayegbeni Yakubu penalty.

Yakubu rifled home a super second, his 12th of the season just after the break, holding off Phil Jones and Michael Carrick before putting his side 2-0 ahead. Almost immediately, Berbatov atoned for his earlier mistake by pulling one back and when the Bulgarian equalized with his sixth goal in three games, United looked set to claim victory. But Kean's men were resolute throughout and in the 80th minute grabbed the winner. It came after United goalkeeper David de Gea flapped at a Morten Gamst Pedersen corner and Grant Hanley was on hand to head home. The result lifted Blackburn off the bottom, while United stayed level on points with neighbors Manchester City, who play Sunday against Sunderland. Ferguson did not temper his reaction to the disappointing defeat which prevented his side leading the EPL at the end of the year. ""It is a disaster,"" he told Press Association.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea captain John Terry is an iconic figure with the English football club's fans as a result of his on-field achievements in more than 15 years at Stamford Bridge. The center-back is the most successful skipper in Chelsea's history, having led the London side to three Premier League titles, three FA Cups and two League Cups since 2004. Terry, who turned 31 this month, has made more than 500 appearances for the club since his senior debut in 1998, one of only five players to do so, and has represented his country 72 times since 2003. After a brief spell on loan at second division Nottingham Forest, Terry established himself in Chelsea's starting line-up as a 20-year-old during the 2000-01 Premier League season. England soccer captain Terry charged with racism . His rise to prominence continued in June 2003 when he made his first appearance for the England national team, as manager Sven Goran Eriksson introduced him as a second-half substitute in a 2-1 win over Serbia and Montenegro. When former France defender Marcel Desailly left Chelsea in 2004, Terry was handed the captain's armband by then manager Jose Mourinho. His first year as skipper ended in glory, with the Blues lifting their first English championship in 50 years -- a feat that was repeated the following season. In 2006 Terry traveled to the FIFA World Cup with England, his second major tournament with the team having also played at Euro 2004. Both events ended at the quarterfinal stage for Eriksson's side. Footballers are TV stars, and should act like it . The defender was named England captain by Eriksson's successor Steve McClaren, and scored in his first match wearing the armband -- a 4-0 defeat of Greece at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium. It was against United that Terry experienced one of the most dramatic lows of his career, in the 2008 European Champions League final . Terry missed the chance to clinch Chelsea's first European crown when he slipped while taking a penalty in the shootout, and his effort hit the post. United went on to triumph at a rain-soaked Luzhniki Stadium. In 2009-10, Terry became the first man to lead the Blues to a Premier League and FA Cup double. Off the pitch, 2010 was a turbulent year for Terry. Revelations about his personal life were widely reported in the British press and he was also stripped of the England captaincy before the World Cup in South Africa. Terry's second World Cup with England ended in humiliation as Fabio Capello's team crashed 4-0 to Germany in the round of 16. Capello reinstated Terry as England captain in March 2011 as a result of an injury to United center-back Rio Ferdinand. Terry has made 502 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 46 goals. He has also found the net on six occasions for England.","John Terry made his Chelsea debut against Aston Villa in 1998 .

People have to understand that,"" said Henry, who has been training with the Arsenal squad since November and could make his first appearance in Monday's FA Cup tie against Leeds.

I am just going to be part of the squad.""

"(CNN) -- Samuel Eto'o can return to international action in September after the Cameroon Football Federation decided to reduce the four-time African player of the year's 15-match suspension to eight months. The 30-year-old national captain, who has represented his country more than 100 times, was punished last month for his role in the team's players refusing to play in a friendly against Algeria in November due to unpaid bonuses. But Friday's meeting of the federation's executive meeting ended with his ban being cut, while his vice-captain Enoh Eyong had a two-match suspension halved and defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto's $2,000 fine for refusing national call-ups was waived. Cameroon had to pay Algeria's FA $500,000 in compensation, but the subsequent punishment of the players attracted strong criticism and reports claimed that President Paul Biya intervened to have the rulings reconsidered. Eto'o is widely considered one of the greatest players Africa has produced, having had a distinguished career with European heavyweights Barcelona and Inter Milan before moving to Russia's Anzhi Makhachkala in a big-money deal last year. The federation -- known as Fecafoot -- released a statement on Saturday describing him as ""a world famous athlete who has rendered outstanding services to the national team of Cameroon."" Eto'o will miss the two-legged 2013 African Cup of Nations qualifier against Guinea Bissau on February 29 and June 15, plus 2014 World Cup qualifiers against Democratic Republic of Congo on June 1 and Libya a week later.

"(CNN) -- Paul Scholes came out of retirement for a shock return as Manchester United beat FA Cup holders Manchester City 3-2 in Sunday's dramatic third-round tie between England's top two teams. The 37-year-old former England international quit at the end of last season, but was named as a substitute by manager Alex Ferguson after agreeing to return for the rest of this season. He came off the bench just before the hour mark to be cheered by the visiting United fans at the Etihad Stadium, with the Premier League champions already 3-0 ahead. Scholes' return was not entirely successful as his mistake led to City's second goal, scored by Sergio Aguero, but United held on for a hard-fought victory. Who are January's top transfer targets? Premier League leaders City had captain Vincent Kompany sent off after 12 minutes and were 3-0 down at halftime before forging a comeback. The defender's red card could cost him a four-match ban, which would be a blow to City's hopes of a first league title since 1968 given that Yaya and Kolo Toure are away for a month at the African Cup of Nations. City manager Roberto Mancini said the club would appeal Kompany's second straight red this season, which came for a two-footed lunge on United winger Nani in the 12th minute at 1-0 down. ""We will appeal. I am sure we will win,"" Mancini said. Wayne Rooney scored twice for United, either side of Kompany's controversial red card, as he returned to form following reports that the club wanted to sell him. He said Scholes' recall had been a big surprise. Blog: Who are the top 10 transfer targets ? ""It was a bit of a shock to be honest, we didn't know until we were in the dressing room, but he's a great player,"" Rooney told ITV Sport. Ferguson opted for Scholes, who has been working with the reserves at United, with his squad hit by an injury crisis. ""It's fantastic that Paul has made this decision,"" Ferguson said before the match started. ""He has kept himself in great shape and I always felt that he had another season in him. It's terrific to have him back."" Rooney's 10th-minute header put United ahead, then Kompany was dismissed by referee Chris Foy soon after. Fellow striker Danny Welbeck made it 2-0 with a superb volley before earning the spot-kick to give Rooney the chance to score his second. Rooney saw his effort saved by City's stand-in keeper Costel Pantilmon -- who replaced rested England No.1 Joe Hart -- but then headed home the rebound. Aleksandar Kolarov gave Roberto Mancini's men an early second-half lifeline with a free-kick from the edge of the area before the entry of Scholes. His mistake let James Milner cross for Aguero's goal, but otherwise he gave an assured display in his return to the big time. United's reward for beating their local rivals is a mouthwatering fourth-round tie at Liverpool, who beat Oldham 5-1 Friday. Liverpool decide against appeal in Suarez race ban case . It will be the first clash between the two sides since the October league clash which led to an eight-game ban for Luis Suarez for racially abusing United's Patrice Evra. Everton-Fulham is another confirmed all-Premier League tie, while Arsenal, if they beat Leeds on Monday, will be at home to Aston Villa. In Sunday's other third-round action Sunday, Ramires scored twice as Chelsea enjoyed a 4-0 victory over Portsmouth at Stamford Bridge. His late double and an added time fourth for Frank Lampard were hard on Pompey, who had restricted Chelsea to a goal by Juan Mata in the 48th minute.

Barcelona full-back Daniel Alves gave them an 11th-minute lead with a speculative long-range effort that goalkeeper Sebastian Viera allowed to bounce over him and into the net.

""Milan can not go on losing $100 million a year,"" he told Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport on Thursday . ""Kaka has behaved very professionally with us, he has never asked for his deal to be revised or his contract extended. He has been here six years and won everything there is to win. But we can't afford to miss out on $100 million.""

"London, England (CNN) -- Lang Lang Revealed - narrated by Jazz Legend Herbie Hancock. Heralded as the ""hottest artist on the classical music planet"" by The New York Times, 27-year-old Lang Lang has played sold out recitals and concerts in every major city in the world. The Chinese child prodigy started playing piano at the age of 3, won his first competition aged 5, and today age 27, he is on Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. On this month's Revealed, we follow the piano prodigy on an adventure out of his classical zone, and into the jazz world to meet his hero, American legend Herbie Hancock. Hancock narrates us through this journey, following Lang Lang back to China for a bittersweet trip down memory lane, and then onto Montreux in Switzerland for his first foray into the jazz world. Today Lang Lang is so much in demand that he is constantly on the move, joking to CNN, ""I am a professional traveler."" Revealed joins Lang Lang on board his private jet on a trip to China, where his megastardom has reached levels which make public outings rather problematic; Lang Lang is mobbed as soon as he sets foot on the street. We talk to his parents about the practice regime they implemented from the age of 4, and the ruthless work ethic that they believe has brought him success. Lang Lang has made it his mission to share classical music around the world, with an emphasis on training children through outreach programs. Following his performance at the opening of Beijing's 2008 Olympic Games, he became a symbol of the youth and future of China. This status has inspired over 35 million Chinese children to learn to play classical piano - a phenomenon popularly referred to as ""the Lang Lang effect."" Revealed documents the days leading up to Lang Lang's next major Chinese performance. He has been selected by the government to perform in celebrations of the 60-year Anniversary of the People's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square, a fitting performance for the prodigy who is seen to embody modern China. The frenzy surrounding Lang Lang in China inspired iconic piano maker Steinway to create their first piano branded in someone's name. On a visit to the Steinway shop along the way, Lang Lang meets two aspiring young pianists, and Revealed captures an impromptu masterclass with the two young boys. Lang Lang is not however everyone's cup of tea. Famously ""loved by some, reviled by others,"" there are those who find his flashy image and demonstrative performing styles at odds with the world of classical music. But Lang Lang is not concerned about that. His mission is to spread a love of music and popularize classical works. Revealed follows him to the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, where he teams up with his hero, Jazz legend Hancock. The feeling of admiration is entirely mutual, and for Hancock who has not played classical repertoire in many years, he is feeling out of his depth. ""Lang Lang is totally amazing, I'm pretty terrified to be up on stage playing alongside him. I've never practiced so much in my life!"" Backstage another Jazz legend Quincy Jones has popped by for the concert, remarking, ""Lang Lang has taken the world by storm. This is as good as it gets."" Only 27 years old, Lang Lang is high on life and music, and hungry for as much adventure as he can get his hands on. His energy and enthusiasm rubs off on all those he comes into contact with, and as Revealed quickly discovers, a trail of laughter, hugs and applause seems to follow him everywhere he goes.

"(CNN) -- Kaka converted a penalty in time added on to give holders Brazil a dramatic 4-3 win over Egypt who filed an official complaint after their Confederations Cup opener at Bloemfontein on Monday. Kaka celebrates after his last-gasp penalty gives holders Brazil an opening win in their Confed Cup victory. Substitute Ahmed al-Muhamadi was red-carded after handling on the goalline in a desperate attempt to deny Brazil -- and Real Madrid's recent $92million signing Kaka rifled home from the spot for his second goal of the game. But the decision by English referee Howard Webb to award the penalty upset African Nations Cup winners Egypt. They were unhappy that Webb initially blew for a corner but changed his mind after the fourth official, Australia's Matthew Breeze, spoke to him after reportedly seeing television replays. ""Since when do the regulations say it is a penalty based on the monitors or on the television?"" asked Egypt's deputy coach Shawki Gharib. ""Egypt is going to file a complaint against the penalty."" Brazil coach Dunga saw nothing wrong with the decision. ""It was a clear case of a penalty,"" he said, adding that his team let a two-goal lead slip because they were tired. ""We had two tough (World Cup) qualifiers, 23 hours of travel and the time difference. The players have not been sleeping well so obviously we are quite happy with the win."" Substitute Giuseppe Rossi scored a brace to help world champions Italy stage a second-half recovery against 10-man United States and claim a 3-1 victory in their tournament debut in Pretoria. South Africa are staging the tournament as a warm-up for next year's World Cup finals -- with Egypt struggling to qualify for 2010 after their recent 3-1 defeat against Algeria. But it looked as though Egypt were going to deny five-times world champions Brazil an opening victory in their defense of the Confederations crown after a fightback that saw Mohamed Zidan also score twice. Brazil were leading 3-1 at halftime with first-half strikes from Kaka (5 minutes), Luis Fabiano (12) and Juan (37) with Zidan heading home Wael Gomaa's cross on nine. It was all change early in the second half when Egypt drew level with two goals inside a minute. The first came when Sayed Moawad pulled the ball back from the left to Mohamed Shawky who blasted a superb strike beyond Julio Cesar. And Brazil were left reeling when Zidan pulled Egypt level seconds later.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""No matter what I do in life I think I will always be remembered as the wrap dress"" -- (Diane von Furstenberg, CNN 2008) Calling the shots: Diane von Furstenberg oversees a meeting to discuss handbags in New York. Belgian-born, New York-living, ex-member of the German royal family, daughter of a holocaust survivor, socialite and business-woman, Diane von Furstenberg is famous for one thing: a single item of clothing. Her wrap dress -- a patterned piece of jersey tied around the body like a kimono -- sold in the millions. In the 70s, when Von Furstenberg launched her dress business, the wrap's simplicity became synonymous with feminism and the sexual revolution. ""I was selling clothes that would make other women feel confident,"" (Von Furstenberg, CNN, 2008). And the designer herself came to become the face of the brand. Photographed modeling her own clothes, launched a face that became so iconic that Andy Warhol painted her. But with success came boom then bust -- the 80s saw a dramatic nose-dive in the quality and distribution of the DVF brand. ""I became successful very quickly, a lot of people wanted my name and I licensed a lot of things .. the spirit of the brand disappeared"", (Von Furstenberg, CNN, 2008). In the late 90s, wrap dresses came back in to fashion, and DVF returned to the fashion pages, and subsequently fashion shows, of the age. The comeback is recorded as one of the most successful business stories of the decade. Her 30 stores and countless concessions in department stores make the DVF brand a multi-million dollar fashion empire. She dresses celebrities from Madonna to Sharon Stone, but keeps her products affordable and maintains an ethos of ""easy to wear"" ""When a woman goes in to a DVF shop and tries something on, it's like a light turns on"", (Von Furstenberg, CNN, 2008). Celebrities are often snapped wearing Von Furstenberg's designs. DVF often clings to Eva Longoria Parker's silhouette who declares to Revealed ""She is one of my favorite people -- not just a designer!"" Honored by the Council of Fashion of Designers of America (CFDA) by inviting Von Furstenberg to act as President -- she is now seen as the Grand Dame of New York fashion. CNN gains access to her as she prepares for the 2008 CFDA Awards -- deciding at the last moment to ditch one of her own designs and wear an Yves St Laurent tuxedo in a tribute to her friend, the designer who died a few days before the ceremony. Clearly moved, Revealed includes footage of her rehearsing the changes to her speech to include a touching farewell to YSL: ""He brought art into fashion, and fashion into art. He used to joke that he always wanted to be Matisse. But I think if we could have asked Matisse, he would have wanted to be Yves St Laurent"" she tells CNN. Revealed follows Diane von Furstenberg at an exciting moment in her catwalk history. For the first time she is showing outside of the United States, and the setting for her European debut is a romantic private Florentine garden, under the full moon. The Tuscan capital is a special place for her, as it was half an hour down the road that her first wrap dress was produced in a local textile factory. We document the magnificent event from a behind-the-scenes perspective. Interviewing Von Furstenberg herself, along with supermodel Natalia Vodianova, and DVF Creative Director Nathan Jenden; we get a sense of the unfolding of a magical star-lit event. From fittings and dress rehearsals, to visits from the 9-year-old granddaughter Von Furstenberg lovingly calls 'her assistant,' we experience the excitement of the designer returning home to Europe and putting on a magnificent show to herald her arrival. The theme of the collection is ""Le Petit Valise"" -- a group of outfits that can be easily packed and will not crumple; a notion in keeping with the spirit of the DVF brand. Inspired by the Talented Mr Ripley, 600 guests including Lapo Elkan (heir to the Fiat empire) witness the 50 wardrobe changes of a young American traveling abroad.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Very few people who attended the performance of the World Orchestra for Peace in Jerusalem this October would have noticed she was there. But there she was, a petite woman with long brown hair, sitting in the middle of the audience on ""nervous autopilot."" Roxanna Panufnik's ""Three Paths to Peace"" was performed by the World Orchestra for Peace in Jerusalem. British composer Roxanna Panufnik wrote the piece that opened the concert, ""Three Paths to Peace,"" an orchestral prelude specially commissioned for the occasion. ""This is probably the biggest gig a composer could get,"" Panufnik told CNN. ""I sit there in the audience and I just can't believe that this is happening, that all these people have gone to this trouble for my music."" The World Orchestra for Peace only comes together once every few years at the behest of its conductor, Valery Gergiev and the orchestra's director, Charles Kaye. On October 19, some of the world's most talented musicians were invited to perform a concert in Jerusalem to promote peace. Read more about the World Orchestra for Peace . Months earlier, Panufnik had been asked to compose an original piece for the program. She said her busy schedule didn't allow time to construct a piece from scratch, so she sent the organizers a recording of a violin concerto she had composed in 2004 called ""Abraham."" The concerto merged elements of Christian, Jewish and Islamic music into a ""homogenous, harmonious and joyful conclusion,"" she said. It seemed perfect for the occasion. ""They loved it,"" she told CNN. ""They asked me to make an orchestral prelude out of it which included making it two-thirds of the length and also assimilating the solo violin part into the rest of the orchestra."" The resulting piece is a musical representation of the biblical story of Genesis 22, which tells of Abraham being given a last-minute reprieve after being asked by God to sacrifice his only son.  See a clip of ""Three Paths to Peace,"" as performed by the World Orchestra for Peace » . ""Abraham is considered the father of all these three faiths,"" Panufnik explains. ""The whole concept behind it is that despite all the conflict in the world between the three monotheistic faiths: Christianity, Judaism and Islam -- we do all believe in the same one God."" Catholic plainsong is interwoven with Anglican Church bell patterns; Judaism is represented by an Ashkenazi Jewish chant and Shofar horn; while Islam is conveyed through Sufi drum patterns and the musical elements from a traditional call to prayer. The original piece required detailed research so as not to risk offense. Muslim clerics in the United Kingdom advised her to listen to many calls to prayer as inspiration for her own, she said. ""I listened to some from Pakistan and Turkey and then took some of the musical elements like the ornamentation and the rhythms."" The audience seated in the Jerusalem Theater for the piece's world premiere seemed to appreciate her efforts. ""I sort of go on nervous autopilot at these things,"" Panufnik said. ""But they did that rhythmic clapping thing, you know, when everyone starts clapping at the same time, which I'm told is a big sign of appreciation."" She hopes the ""Three Paths to Peace"" is performed again, but right now she's still buzzing from its debut. ""I came home on Monday night and I woke up on Tuesday morning and thought, 'did I dream this?' It was amazing."" ""A lot of people came up to me afterwards to tell me they loved it, and how moved they were by it. That's great for me as a composer. It's all composers really want isn't it?""","British composer Roxanna Panufnik tells CNN about her latest world premiere .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- On the surface, the similarities are striking; they were both princesses born in the 1940s in a foreign land. Young and beautiful, the long-haired brunettes soon fell in love and followed their men to the United States where they built a reputation for steely determination and strength. Diane von Furstenberg's comic book image appears in the window at the London launch of her Wonder Woman collection. Thirty years later, in the 1970s, one was rewarded with her own fashion empire, the other, her own TV show. The only thing really separating them was the magic lasso. Oh, and the invisible plane, and maybe the bracelets that deflect bullets... Belgian-born New York designer Diane von Furstenberg has used Diana Prince, aka Wonder Woman, as inspiration for her latest collection, a brightly-colored clothing range that proves dressing like a cartoon character needn't involve teaming knee-high boots with hot pants. The influence of the American stars and stripes are evident in the collection, but in the star piece, a full-length dress, they blend together in muted tones, hinting only at their origin rather than screaming out superhero. The collection was launched in London last night, a day after Barack Obama stormed home as the next President of the United States. Diane von Furstenberg watched the election results from a London hotel room, having lodged an absentee vote from Asia. ""I think it's amazing -- I think we need him desperately,"" she said. In what could only be a gift from the marketing gods, images of the President-elect dressed as Superman started appearing on street corners in the U.S. in the lead-up to the election. Obama has insisted he's no superman, but do the images demonstrate that America is hoping and searching for a superhero? If not Superman, maybe Wonder Woman? ""It's not about a superhero,"" says Diane von Furstenberg. It's just because he's bright and he's willing to do the work. And he's young and he has energy, and that's it."" Of all of America's superheroes -- and there are many -- Wonder Woman is seen as one of the most patriotic. She literally wears the stars and stripes.  See images of Wonder Woman through the ages and the DVF collection » . She was created in 1941 during World War II by William Moulton Marston as a female alternative to the plethora of male action heroes who were saving the world in comic books of the day. He also invented the lie detector, the early version of Wonder Woman's ""Lasso of Truth."" As the story goes, Wonder Woman was an Amazonian princess who left her home on Paradise Island to fight the ""Axis powers"" in the world of man. By day, she was Diana Prince who, with a quick spin, transformed into Wonder Woman, ready to destroy Nazi enemies, foil Japanese plots and expose international spy rings. In the early 1970s, she became a cover girl for feminism, appearing on the cover of the inaugural ""Ms."" magazine. Fame followed on television when she was immortalized by actress Lynda Carter. After years of lying low, she starred in a popular exhibition ""Superheroes: Fantasy and Fashion"" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York earlier this year. Curator Andrew Bolton says, ""When designers look to Wonder Woman there are two things they seem to refer to -- her role as Amazon woman, this strong powerful Amazonian figure -- and her as a symbol of America, a symbol of democracy."" In 2001, John Galliano for Christian Dior used Wonder Woman as inspiration for a rather risque ensemble which included a red and white striped jacket, starry gold bustier and tiny knickers. Bolton says the 9/11 attacks in 2001 sparked a resurgence in American patriotism that's been strengthened this week with the election of a man with a mandate for change. ""I think that the idea of patriotism has become much more potent, certainly in light of recent events,"" Bolton says. ""It's a celebration of a new regime, a new democratic regime."" It's perfect timing perhaps for the launch of a fashion range that celebrates an all-American, albeit originally Amazonian, hero. For Diane, the Wonder Woman collection is more about empowering women than tapping into the zeitgeist: ""The message is that there's a wonder woman inside every one of us,"" she says. She's penned a limited edition comic book to go with the collection, ""The Adventures of Diva, Viva and Fifa,"" which is emblazoned with the message ""Be the Wonder Woman you can be."" All proceeds from the sale of the comic books, and a portion of the sales of the collection, go to Vital Voices, a non-governmental organization that aspires to empower women in developing countries, to address human trafficking and to train future leaders. ""What Diane von Furstenberg has done for us, by the Wonder Woman book, by supporting us in the way she has done has raised the profile of Vital Voices,"" says Baroness Mary Goudie, one of the group's directors. ""And by her example, she's empowering young women and other women around the world."" A bit like Wonder Woman, really.","Wonder Woman inspired Diane von Furstenberg's latest fashion collection .

"(Mashable) -- Facebook plans to roll out a major redesign of user profiles at its f8 developer conference this week, Mashable has learned. Details about the redesign are sparse, but two sources familiar with Facebook's plans (who have asked to remain anonymous) have told us that the redesign is ""major"" and will make Facebook profiles nexuses for consuming content. The profile changes will be part of a wider launch, one that will include launch of a music and media platform. Here's what we know so far about the profile redesign: . -- The redesigned profiles will be more ""sticky,"" says one source. One of the goals of the new profiles is to get users to stay on them for longer. -- We already knew Facebook is launching a media platform at f8. However, we've also learned that the platform -- which will include music and video from partner sites -- will display the media content a user is watching or listening to on their profiles. Essentially, when you're listening to Lady Gaga on Spotify, your friends can see and access that on your Facebook profile. This confirms a recent New York Times report. -- The redesigned profiles are part of a larger push into social ecommerce. We don't exactly know what that means, but we've heard whispers that Facebook intends to give Facebook Credits more prominence. We've also heard that a Facebook app store may emerge at f8. -- Facebook's push into ecommerce may be related Project Spartan, an HTML5-based mobile platform rumored to be launching soon. Facebook is being tight-lipped about the changes; the company declined to comment on this story. However, more and more pieces of Facebook's big launch continue to leak out as the excitement builds for f8 (feel free to send us screenshots if you have any) The company is currently under lockdown, trying to fix the final bugs before Thursday's big launch.

"(CNN) -- For the last 20 years, what name is always in the top 100 most popular baby names given to boys in the United States? Jesus (pronounced hey-seus). And among 4,500 boys names in England in 2009, what was the No. 1 most popular baby name? Mohammed. In Brussels? Mohammed. Oslo? Mohammed. Amsterdam? Mohammed. And what do babies and their names have to do with the global economy? Everything. The currency of the future is babies, because babies grow up to be taxpaying workers. Let's do Demography 101, which is basically the study of baby-making. Demographers have a fancy term called ""total fertility rate,"" which measures the average number of babies a woman has over her childbearing years. The magic number you need to remember is 2.1. This is the average number of babies a country needs to remain at equilibrium. It makes sense, too. When a mother and father die, they need to be replaced by two babies, or else the population declines. A rich powerful country needs lots of babies to project geopolitical power and increase its productivity. If you won't multiply, who will fight your wars? Who will pay Social Security to support grandpa? Who do you think will start the next Facebook, Amazon or Google? The U.S. total fertility rate is at 2.09, and at that level we just replace our population. That's not good. But wait a minute, why do we keep growing? Simple: immigration. Our favorable immigration policy and liberal treatment of the millions of people working without legal documents means our population will grow from 312 million today to 439 million in 2050. Hispanic babies, 83 million of them, will account for 65% of that growth.Â  This is where the total fertility rate comes into play again, 2.84 for Hispanics, but only 1.84 and trending much lower for non-Hispanic whites who will only add  4 million babies to the melting pot. Keep in mind that those Hispanic babies born here to Mitt Romney's ""self-deportation"" candidates are all red-blooded American citizens -- our future Navy SEALs, entrepreneurs, middle-class working Americans and maybe even a president. Demography will shape the geopolitics of the two largest economies of the 21st century: the United States and the European Union. They will maintain their status as world powers principally through immigration. U.S. politicians voted Thursday to possibly saddle our grandkids with $16.4 trillion in debt, but European politicians trying to fix their debt quagmire don't have grandkids to stick it to. Europe is dying as its nations run out of babies. Three-quarters of Europeans live in societies with fertility rates below 1.5. In the 14th century, the bubonic plague wiped out 75 million people; and in the 21st century, a larger number will be lost in Europe through demographic suicide. Europe's demographic meltdown means it has to turn to immigrants for its workforce, and the vacuum is being filled by Muslims. From 1990 to 2010, the Muslim population of Europe grew from 30 million to 44 million. It will reach 58 million by 2030 and 10 European countries will be more than 10% Muslim. While a spirit of integration and tolerance is central to the beliefs of the vast majority of Muslims, a radical, well-funded Islamist minority rejects tolerance, democracy and women's rights. This militant Islamist tumor has metastasized to intimidate, marginalize and silence moderate Muslims who share the values of a democratic culture. Without baby Mohammeds, Europe will die. To survive, its leaders need to work with moderate Muslims to neutralize fundamentalist views and challenge anti-immigration voices. If Europe is unable to reform its immigration policies, then the geopolitical ramification is obvious: a neutered NATO alliance unable to project military and economic power. The United States faces its own evolving relationship with immigrants, one that is defined by widely contrasting views as to how they should be integrated into society -- or not. Fears that immigrants will not assimilate are not new. We certainly have not lost our capacity to welcome and absorb newcomers, as America has since its birth. A recent survey by Public Agenda asked immigrants in America how long it took them to feel comfortable and part of the community. Seventy-seven percent said it took less than five years. Hispanics are every bit as American as anyone else -- they are white, brown and black. They are self-reliant with strong family values and highly religious. For 92% of Hispanics, God is an active force in their daily lives: 66% are Catholic, 25% are Evangelical Christians and 1% are Jewish or other denominations. Hispanics are also very patriotic. More than 25% of the 58,195 names on the Vietnam War Memorial are Hispanic, and one of the first people to die in the Iraq War was Lance Cpl. Jose Gutierrez, who entered the United States illegally and was granted citizenship posthumously. While Hispanic immigrants are accused of driving down wages, economic studies have found the opposite to be true. Conducting research on the effects of immigration on wages over the span of a decade for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Gianmarco Ottaviano, of the University of Bologna, and Giovanni Peri, of the University of California, Davis, found that nearly 90% of native born American workers actually enjoy higher wages because of immigration. They found that immigrants have a positive impact on the U.S. economy because they differ in their educational and skill levels from U.S. natives, and because more workers in the labor force increases productivity and stimulates the creation of businesses. The sustainable competitive advantage of America over any other country is that we do immigration best. No one can touch our capacity to integrate and assimilate people from all cultures. It keeps us young, strong and dynamic. The benefits of immigration are often taken for granted.Â  Immigrants work hard. They form strong families. They live longer. They set up businesses. They spend money and pay taxes. They take care of children so parents can work. And the number of immigrants on welfare is far lower than anti-immigration advocates would have us believe. As the arrows fly about immigration reform, legislators and voters alike can either accept immigrants, of all faiths, as the incontrovertible engines for economic growth they are -- or we can fight the future and the facts and shoot ourselves in the foot instead. Some choose to believe that we are being overrun by lazy immigrants that strain our welfare system. Yet every American should know by now that immigrants are the lifeblood of our future strength and economic power. And for that, we should thank a baby named Jesus. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- He immortalized the ""smell of napalm in the morning"" in ""Apocalypse Now,"" but Robert Duvall's first meeting with director Francis Ford Coppola was no indication of the fruitful relationship to come. Duvall starred in Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather,"" ""The Godfather: Part II"" and ""Apocalypse Now."" It was 1969 and Coppola had parted ways with a lead character in indie film ""The Rain People."" He was stuck and 38-year-old Duvall was drafted in at the last minute on the suggestion of a friend. Despite slapdash beginnings, their work together has produced some of Duvall's greatest roles and many of Coppola's most critically-acclaimed films. Duvall started working in theater in the 1950s before moving into film in the early 1960s with roles like Boo Radley in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Things took off for him in 1970s when he starred in Coppola's multiple award-winning movies ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II,"" But, it is his Oscar-nominated turn as indestructible, napalm-loving Lt. Colonel Kilgore in Coppola's Vietnam war opus ""Apocalypse Now"" that remains one of Duvall's most enduring roles. Duvall sits down with CNN's Revealed and talks about, ""Apocalypse Now"" and his relationship with the master movie-maker. Revealed: Can you sum up the impact Coppola had on your life, your career? RD: I would have had another career. He helped all our careers with ""The Godfather."" It was a kind of catalyst for all the actors in one and two. It helped me. I kinda designed my own career. Revealed: What's Coppola's approach to directing? RD: I think sometimes Francis works best amidst confusion and I mean that in a good way. He'll come in and say, 'Let's try something,' and then you rehearse. Like any good director he sees what you bring. He realizes it's gotta come from the actor. He's open enough ... of course, he'll give his opinion but he wants to see what you bring. Revealed: The problems Coppola encountered while shooting ""Apocalypse Now"" are legendary. What was it like working on that film? RD: There are things I won't go into! But it was pretty crazy. Sometimes we'd get one shot in a day, if that. Everything was in disarray. The hurricane came in and ruined the sets, s**t! Then they had to build them again, and we were there nine or 10 months. Dennis Hopper all doped up, not doing it Francis' way. Francis would do 45 takes, and then he said, 'Now, would you please do one my way,"" he'd say to Dennis. Martin Sheen got the heart attack, and they didn't know what they would do if they lost Martin. Francis said it was like warfare.  Watch Coppola and others talk about the making of ""Apocalypse Now"" » . Revealed: You say that people constantly come up to you in the street and say the line, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning.' RD: It is a pretty famous line. Everybody relates to that line. Scenes like that we had to get quickly because all that fire at the back of me was supposed to be the napalm. Sometimes when you work fast and under duress ... sometimes that's the best stuff you can get. Revealed: How did your life change after ""Apocalypse Now,"" and the ""Godfather"" films came out? RD: It was kind of a landmark. I said we're in something pretty important here, as far as film goes and it was true, and I gained a lot of respect for Francis because I didn't know him that well on ""The Rain People."" It's Coppola's vision. It could have been made by Disney as long as he was directing it. Which one of Coppola's films would you put in a time capsule for future generations? Tell us below in the SoundOff box . Revealed: What is it about Coppola that makes him such a great director? RD: A guy like Coppola, you know, as a director, he wants to see what you bring, without dictating. He's not a dictator. He has a definite vision, but he's not going to get in there and say it has to be my way or the highway. He really wants to see what you bring. He'll say, 'Come on guys quit fooling around we gotta make a movie!' You branch off into laughing and making jokes, but that's good for the set and he knows that too. It's his own gift and it's his own way of working. Revealed: Coppola says now he wants to make small, intimate movies he has written himself. What's your take on that? RD: He's a big spender. Now he's making all the wine and everything else, he can go back to independent film. Why not? He said ""The Conversation"" was his favorite film. It was certainly one of his best, I think. Why not go back to what he started out as? In the 1970s it was as if the independent filmmaking community was within the establishment. Now it's back outside the establishment starting to make the kind of films he started out doing. Revealed: Can you describe Francis in a few words? RD: A talented maniac. No, no, not a maniac, but he's a talented, driven guy. He's a heavy hitter.","Actor Robert Duvall first worked with Francis Ford Coppola 40 years ago .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Somewhere in South America right now a head-banger is getting very excited. The crowd went wild when Iron Maiden took to the stage in Colombia earlier this year. They're going back in March, 2009. Veteran hell-raisers Iron Maiden have announced five new tour dates in Brazil, within months of playing to capacity crowds in some of country's biggest music venues. Last March, they packed  the 40,000 capacity Palmeiras Stadium in Sao Paulo. Next March, they'll be following in the formidable footsteps of Formula One World Champion Lewis Hamilton, rock band Kiss and the Pope, no less, to wow the crowds at the Autodromo de Interlagos. The race track is one venue they don't expect to sell out. ""Capacity is about 400,000. I don't think we'll get 400,000,"" Iron Maiden's manager Rod Smallwood told CNN, ""We're set for about 60,000 and we hope to go past that."" The band has every reason to be confident of strong ticket sales in South America where fan loyalty verges on fanaticism.  Watch part one of Iron Maiden Revealed » . When the band last toured Curitiba in Brazil in March 2008, thousands of ecstatic ""Maiden"" supporters kept them awake overnight by booming Iron Maiden music outside their hotel. Across Latin America, they sold 250,000 tickets in less than one week to nine concerts in seven countries. In Colombia, they set a new record for the fastest ticket sales of any event. Rapid ticket sales are expected this Saturday when seats go on sale for three new concerts in Latin America: Venezuela, Colombia and Chile. Tickets for concerts in Brazil are due to go on sale next week -- along with seats for four concerts which are still to be announced, in four more countries, two of which will host Iron Maiden for the first time. ""We've always had tremendous success with the fans down there (in Latin America),"" said Smallwood. But why, many may be moved to ask? What is it about Iron Maiden and South America? Are they in love with Iron Maiden or is it heavy metal as a music genre that's really captured their hearts? What do you think? Sound off below. Malcolm Dome, presenter of British heavy metal radio station TotalRock has a theory. ""The Latin way of life seems to connect with heavy metal enormously,"" he told CNN. ""It's not just in South America, it's the Latin communities in Spain and Portugal."" ""I think it's got a lot to do with what heavy metal represents -- passion, energy, emotion, rebellion, a slight anarchy. I think it's the part of the Latin mentality,"" he added. Iron Maiden may have been formed in a London pub the 1970s, but it wasn't until 1985 when they took to the stage at the original ""Rock in Rio"" concert that their South American fan base began to swell. The band played one gig as guests of British compatriots, Queen, that was broadcast live across the continent winning them new fans, many of whom have stayed loyal over the years. Heavy metal has not always been viewed with the same sense of awe by fans in South America, according to Cristiane Richardson, a Brazilian who presents the weekly heavy metal radio show Sonic Attack from London. ""It started perhaps as a novelty,"" Richardson told CNN, ""Maybe it was kids rebelling against the samba or the church, but for many years it was looked on as a joke almost."" ""[But] it slowly gained credibility and now if you go to a Havana show you'll see several generations -- fathers bringing their sons and nephews. Older people appreciate it as well. It's not just young kids."" She said Iron Maiden's sheer hard work has also won them fans. ""They make an effort everywhere they go to meet their fans and to learn the local language."" Claudio Vicentin, the editor of South America's best-selling heavy metal magazine Revista Roadie Crew, said, for some fans, heavy metal songs are their first introduction to the English language. ""In Brazil and South America many heavy metal fans begin to learn English translating the lyrics and singing together the lyrics on concerts."" ""The fans here are very passionate about music. And then, once you like heavy metal, you are going to die listening to heavy metal. You are not going to love Iron Maiden just for one summer."" What is it about the music? ""It's the energy of the sound,"" Vicentin said. ""The guitar riffs, the melodies, the heavy drummer sound and the voice of the singer."" Right now, the band is taking a rest from a grueling schedule that started with the first concert in the ""Somewhere Back in Time"" tour in India last February. From there they went to Australia, Japan, the U.S., Latin America and Europe. The tour resumes on February 9, when they'll pack up their version of a tour bus, Ed Force One, a 757 airliner decked out in Iron Maiden logos and take again to the skies for the first scheduled concert in Dubai. As in previous legs, lead singer Bruce Dickinson will be in the pilot's seat, flying the entire band and their roadies from city to city. One thing that will change is the line up. ""It will be different from last time,"" Smallwood told CNN. ""We'll have pyros with us which we didn't take last time (and) there'll be a few songs we didn't do last time.""","Heavy metal icons Iron Maiden announce new tour dates for South America .

"(CNN) -- A Tennessee woman secretly gave birth to twin boys in a toilet in the home she shares with her parents and then smothered the infants and hid their bodies in a bedroom laundry basket, police said Friday. Lindsey Lowe's father discovered one of the bodies Wednesday morning and called police, Hendersonville Police Lt. Scott Ryan said. ""Someone can give me 100 explanations as to why, but I will never be able to understand this fully,"" he said. Lowe, 25, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. She remained jailed Friday pending a Monday appearance before a Sumner County judge. She gave birth to the first baby between 8:30 and 9 p.m. Monday, according to an affidavit filed by police. Lowe, who according to the affidavit confessed to killing her newborns, said she didn't look at either of the babies as she ""placed her hand"" over each child's mouths to stop them from crying. Lowe told authorities that she knew she was pregnant ""almost the whole time"" but that no one else -- including her family -- was aware, according to the affidavit. It took a ""couple of minutes"" for the first child to die, according to the affidavit, while Lowe said the second baby died more quickly. Both children were males and full-term, weighing about 5 to 6 pounds, the affidavit said. The woman told police she placed the bodies in a laundry basket and covered them with towels to hide them. Her attorney, John Pellegrin, said that his client was ""extremely distraught"" in the two times he's met with her in jail. Pellegrin said Lowe was ""on suicide watch,"" receiving sedatives from medical personnel at the corrections facility. ""This is an inexplicable situation and extremely sad for everyone involved,"" Pellegrin told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell. She was at work at a dental clinic for children when her father found the bodies, police said. One of her co-workers, Michelle Stainback, told CNN affiliate WTVF that ""we're all just shocked and saddened."" ""I've tried to put myself in that position over and over since last night,"" she said. ""You don't know what they're thinking or what they're going through."" Ryan admitted that authorities still didn't have all the answers. And Ron Blanton, an assistant district attorney in Sumner County, told HLN's Velez-Mitchell that the case ""wears on"" those seeking justice in the case. ""It's a horrible tragedy, a horrible tragedy,"" Blanton said.

"(CNN) -- Officials in Muskingham County closed schools as sheriff's deputies equipped with night vision attempted to hunt down dozens of exotic animals, including bears, lions, tigers, cheetahs, wolves, giraffes and camels, who are on the prowl in eastern Ohio following the death of the man at the farm where they lived. ""Deputies are currently patrolling the area in pickup trucks, armed with shotguns,"" Sheriff Matt Lutz said in a statement. ""There are still thought to be several dangerous animals on the loose, creating a public safety threat."" Bears and wolves were spotted along I-70. Area residents are being advised to stay inside until the dangerous animals are rounded up or killed. Terry Thompson, the owner of the land and animals, was found dead on the scene outside the home, according to Lutz, who didn't elaborate, Thompson was recently released from prison for an unknown crime. In 2005, Thompson was sentenced to six months of house arrest and fined him $2,870 for a conviction on abuse of animals. Some 48 animals had been freed, authorities said, with about two dozen shot dead by deputies.

"(CNN) -- A man accused of an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States was too disorganized to have been a part of the scheme, a friend said. Manssor Arbabsiar is accused of conspiracy to murder a foreign official, conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism. Known as ""Jack"" because of his affinity for the whiskey Jack Daniels, the 56-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen wasn't much of a businessman, according to David Tomscha, who owned a car lot with him for about a year in 2000. ""If they wanted 007, I think they got Mr. Bean,"" Tomscha said. ""He was very disorganized, he would lose most anything and he would get the dates of the cars wrong,"" Tomscha said. ""He'd tell you it was an '89 and maybe it was an '85. One thing you could be sure, whatever date he told you, it wasn't that year."" The disorganization extended to his personal life. ""He wouldn't pay his bills, not because he didn't have the money necessarily, but because he would forget to pay them,"" Tomscha said. ""If it wasn't for his wife, he'd be homeless on the street."" Earlier this week, another friend Mitchel Hamauei, who has known Arbabsiar for 20 years, said he didn't seem to have strong views on politics or religion. ""It was shocking because it didn't seem like he would be the type of person to do something like that,"" Hamauei said, adding that he met Arbabsiar through mutual Iranian friends. Arbabsiar and Gholam Shakuri, an Iran-based member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, are accused of a conspiracy to murder a foreign official, conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism, the FBI said Tuesday. Arbabsiar was arrested in September. Shakuri remains at large, the bureau said. The two were in a group that began planning this spring to kill Saudi Ambassador Adel Al-Jubeir, the FBI said. ""I don't think he's the Manchurian candidate,"" said Tomscha. ""He came over. He liked this country. He made money here."" Arbabsiar has had prior brushes with the law, but they were for minor infractions. Public records show three arrests for Arbabsiar over the past 25 years. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail for evading arrest in 1987, and he pleaded ""no contest"" to a lesser charge in 2004 after he was arrested for driving on a suspended license. Arbabsiar also received a speeding ticket in 2007 for going more than 10 mph over the limit. A 2001 theft charge against Arbabsiar was dismissed, CNN affiliate KIII-TV reported. According to the allegations he now faces, Arbabsiar and an undercover informant discussed using explosives to kill the Saudi ambassador and possibly attacking a crowded restaurant, according to an FBI affidavit released Tuesday. The informant named $1.5 million as his price, it said. Arbabsiar allegedly sent $100,000 intended as a down payment, telling the informant his ""cousin"" had deep pockets, court documents said. ""He didn't strike me as the kind of guy who would want to go out there and murder hundreds of innocent people,"" Tomscha said. ""That takes a real callous person and he never stuck me like that.""

"Washington (CNN) -- On this day 100 years ago, troops in the city of Wuchang, in China's Hubei province, launched a coup against local authorities. The coup ignited a civil war that ended in the collapse of China's 2,200-year-old imperial system. When a republican government established itself in 1912, it designated October 10 as the national holiday. Even now, ""Ten-Ten Day"" remains the equivalent of the Fourth of July of the island of Taiwan and for many overseas Chinese communities. On the mainland, however, the Ten-Ten holiday has always been a more ambiguous affair, and so it remains on this centenary. The Los Angeles Times reported: ""The government held low-key celebrations Sunday marking the centennial anniversary of the revolution that ended thousands of years of imperial rule and set the stage for the birth of today's China. Chinese President Hu Jintao and other dignitaries gathered in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, under a giant portrait of Sun Yat-sen, the first president of the Republic of China -- the name still carried by modern-day Taiwan. Hu called for the peaceful reunification of China and Taiwan and reiterated his opposition to Taiwanese independence."" Beyond this political lecture, however, the anniversary was observed in remarkably muted style. A new museum opened in Wuhan. A historical movie was aired on state TV. Some events will be held in the hometown of Sun Yat-Sen, the revolution's moral leader and the first president of the Chinese republic. But there's nothing remotely on the scale of the 2010 Shanghai Expo, let alone the 2008 Olympics. And after all, that diffident approach should come as no surprise. Although the present government of China touts its nationalist credentials, it was born in rebellion -- not against imperial overlords, not against colonialist oppressors, not against Japanese invaders, but precisely against the inheritors of the republic established by the events of 1911: the Kuomintang party created by Sun Yat-Sen. The memory of 1911 is embarrassing in many other ways to the present government. 1911 was a revolution inspired by ideals of democracy and personal liberty. Those ideals are cynically disregarded -- or brutally suppressed -- by China's present government. 1911 was a revolution in defense of traditional Chinese culture against a foreign dynasty, Manchurians who had ruled in China since 1644. But who has done more damage to traditional Chinese culture than the regime in place since 1949? And not only to the bulldozed monuments of China, but to the country's inheritance of art and scholarship, reviled and massacred in the Cultural Revolution. A country ruled by people who took power by violence -- and now hold power by repression -- is not a country that dares look honestly at its past. A year ago, I had the opportunity to visit a museum of the Cultural Revolution in Guangdong province, one of only two such in the entire vastness of the country. It was an against-the-odds achievement that the museum could be built at all, but the price of building it was to tell the story in a way that focused almost exclusively on the victimization of some members of the Communist Party by other members. The authors of the museum bought the freedom to tell a portion of the story by suppressing all the rest. As for the other traumas of China's recent history -- including the terrible self-inflicted famine culminating in mass cannibalism that goes by the mocking name ""the Great Leap Forward"" -- they can only be whispered, if they are discussed at all. The man guilty of those terrible atrocities, Mao Tse-tung, still overlooks Beijing from a giant portrait over Tiananmen Square. So long as the leaders of China trace their power to Mao's legacy, that long will China be obliged to lie to itself about its history. ""The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting."" So wrote Milan Kundera about the communist regimes of central Europe. His words apply as aptly to the regime that governs our planet's most populous nation and most ancient continuing civilization. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Monday marks 100th anniversary of revolution against China's imperial system .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Making great wine is like making a great film, according to director Francis Ford Coppola -- it's defying the impossible. During his 70 years, he has done both. Francis Ford Coppola is the movie-making talent behind some of the greatest films ever made -- he is also a successful winemaker. Coppola is the filmmaking talent behind some of the most highly-regarded  films ever made -- ""The Godfather,"" ""The Conversation,"" ""Apocalypse Now"" -- a fact his stash of five Academy Awards attests to. ""He's able to infuse a certain reality into the films that he's doing,"" director and long-time collaborator, George Lucas told CNN. ""Human touches that take [them] beyond just a cardboard cut-out movie."" He is also a cut above the rest as a winemaker. At his vineyard in California's verdant winegrowing region Napa Valley, the Italian-American has established a reputation as an outstanding vintner -- albeit accidentally. ""As a six-year-old, my father drank wine at the table and the uncles and grandparents, they all drank wine and even the kids were given a little wine. It was just one of the good things of life like food,"" said Coppola. ""I never thought it could be a business."" But, 25 years after stumbling upon his vineyard (now known as the Rubicon Valley Winery) during the search for a family summer home, the wine business has become a lucrative day job for Coppola. With a bottle of Rubicon '79, his sought-after first vintage, selling for $200, Coppola realized he could use the profits to self-fund feature films. ""I said, 'Maybe I'm wealthy enough that I could finance my own little films,'"" Coppola told CNN in the garden of his refurbished Victorian estate mansion.   Watch CNN Revealed: Francis Ford Coppola » . His latest ""little film,"" ""Tetro,"" starring Vincent Gallo, is a family drama that tells the story of a man who goes to Buenos Aires to find his long-disappeared poet brother. When he finds him, they try to come to terms with the rivalry that has driven their successful, creative family apart. It is clearly very autobiographical: Francis' father, Carmine, was a composer and many members of his family throughout the generations are well-known actors, directors and musicians.  Francis Ford Coppola's Hollywood Family Tree » . ""You know, some of the stuff in the movie is not untrue. The family always had these siblings in the same field... there was a lot of rivalry."" According to Coppola, it's a film that would never have been made if he had needed a big budget or funding from a studio. ""If you're making a film that will open all over the world then it has to appeal to the common denominator of all those people. ""Unless you put the money up yourself, you can't do what you want, and that's why I always end up doing it. It just seems so much easier than to have to beg someone to make your film."" Coppola has ample experience of studio-controlled filmmaking. He spent much of the 1990s working as a hired gun on films like ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" and ""The Rainmaker."" Coppola started his career making low budget films as the protege of ""King of the Bs"" Roger Corman. His career moved up a gear after the success of ""The Godfather"" in 1972, which became one of the highest-grossing films in history. ""When I was young I wanted to write and direct little personal films,"" he told CNN. ""I was offered a project that was from a book that turned out to be 'The Godfather' and that project changed my career to something very different from what I would have imagined. ""I never would have imagined myself as a Hollywood or industry director. I mean, not at that level of success."" One of the 1970s group of Hollywood film directors including George Lucas and Martin Scorsese known as the ""movie brats,"" Coppola broke new ground in the ""The Godfather,"" showing the ruthless Corleone gangster's family values, casting them in a sympathetic light. Who is the greatest American film director of the era? Coppola, Scorsese, Lucas, Spielberg? Tell us below in the Sound Off box . Coppola's wife, Eleanor, thinks his Italian-American background was fundamental. ""'The Godfather' was a raw example of his experience at weddings, with family and he just took his experiences and viewed those characters with the familiar aspects that he had known from his uncles and his family,"" she told CNN. In 1979, perhaps his most infamous film, ""Apocalypse Now,"" followed. It is considered by many to be the quintessential film about the nightmare of the Vietnam war. But the film that defined a generation almost ruined Coppola's career. Filming, which started in 1976 took almost three years to complete and ran into financial trouble almost immediately. ""'Apocalypse Now' almost broke me because it was so expensive,"" Coppola remembers. ""I had every nickel that I owned riding on a movie that was going rampantly over-budget and I was going to end up with the bill. In other words, I was going to end up owing somebody $30 million."" Famously, what could go wrong did. A typhoon destroyed the film set, lead actor Martin Sheen had a heart attack aged 39, and Marlon Brando turned up on set grossly overweight and under prepared. ""There's stuff I can't tell you, but it was pretty crazy,"" says actor Robert Duvall who played napalm-loving Lt. Colonel Kilgore. Robert Duvall: Francis Ford Coppola made my career . ""Sometimes we'd get one shot in a day, if that. Everything was in disarray."" Coppola was also battling the screenplay, which which proved to be an epic journey not unlike the one in the film. ""I found myself making a film that was more and more surrealistic and psychedelic, and as I took that trip going up the river making the movie it got weirder and weirder. I couldn't figure out how I was going to end it."" He successfully solved the puzzle and the film and went on to win the coveted Palme D'Or at Cannes film festival and a place in movie history. Today, Coppola seems like a man at peace with himself and his career -- ""I'm in an extremely interesting place."" He has not tired in his pursuit of making great movies and all his experiences have taught him some important lessons. ""There are great films and great wines so it is possible. What is it when the impossible becomes possible? What does it take to do that? It takes incredible, fanatical devotion. Willingness to go through anything.""

"(CNN) -- Percy von Lipinski figures he flies about 100,000 miles a year. He knows he's going to see a healthy share of flight delays regardless of where he goes. A new study says delays will continue to frustrate fliers like this man at Washington's Dulles International Airport. But he especially anticipates them at the larger airports, such as Chicago's O'Hare International -- ""You can't possibly put that many planes there and not have a delay,"" he said -- and New York's John F. Kennedy International. So when he has a choice between two connecting cities, he said he'll generally choose the smaller one. Delays at the larger airports, he said, are compounded by other hassles such as longer distances between terminals. ""There's wear and tear on your travel psyche -- which bus you need, which terminal you should be at,"" said von Lipinski, a 54-year-old Vancouver, British Columbia, resident who owns businesses around the globe. ""By the time you get to your destination, you're bound to come up frazzled."" Delays contribute to that frustration, and there may be more of it to go around these days. Though the percentage of delayed U.S. flights has dipped recently because fewer planes are flying during the recession, there's been a 20-year trend of increasing delays, and the increases should continue once economic growth returns, a study released Thursday by the Brookings Institution said. The average length of U.S. flight delays rose from 40.9 minutes in 1990 to 56.5 minutes in June 2009, according to the study, ""Expect Delays: An Analysis of Air Travel Trends in the United States."" It also found that among delayed flights, the share of those that landed at least two hours late more than doubled from 4.3 percent in 1990 to 10.1 percent in May 2009. And in a 12-month period ending in June 2009, the majority of delays was concentrated in 26 metropolitan areas, or hub cities, the study said. Of these 26 hub cities, six had worse-than-average, on-time percentages for both arrivals and departures: New York; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Miami, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; and San Francisco, California. The nationwide on-time arrival rate was 78.9 percent, and the departure rate was similar, study co-author Robert Puentes said. New York's on-time arrival rate, 66.3 percent, was worst in the nation, said the study, which analyzed air travel between metro areas rather than airports. Delays are going to get worse, study co-author Adie Tomer said. ""On-time performance has improved recently because the number of people flying is at its lowest point since 9/11, but as the economy bounces back, air passenger levels will grow, and on-time performance will likely resume its decline."" The hub cities that did better than the national average for both arrivals and departures were Salt Lake City, Utah; Phoenix, Arizona; Detroit, Michigan; and Washington. The study said on-time performance generally decreases as air travel increases. In 1990, with more than 400,000 domestic passengers nationwide, the country's on-time flight percentage was just under 80 percent. In 2007, with nearly 700,000 domestic passengers, the on-time rate was around 74 percent. The authors recommend Congress and other authorities use the findings to help decide where to invest in high-speed rail projects and other measures to ease airport congestion. Michael Boyd, president of Colorado aviation consulting firm Boyd International Group, is critical of the recommendation, saying the country could handle the current flight demand -- and cut delays -- by improving its air traffic control system. The old system, he said, is outdated, doesn't use all of the sky and directs planes to fly farther and longer than they need to. ""Instead of saying, 'Let's get a system that can handle the traffic,' Brookings wants to lessen the demand. That's a caveman mentality,"" Boyd said. Deron Lovaas, transportation policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the study ""hit the nail on the head in terms of the opportunity"" to promote alternative modes of transportation. ""The planes waste a lot of fuel idling on the tarmac and during takeoff and landing cycles of flight. So the lowest-hanging fruit available for reducing emissions -- beyond changing plane designs and changing the fuel mix in planes -- is to reduce congestion at airports and to go after short haul flights, where a greater percentage of the flight is made up of takeoff and landing cycles, where most of the emissions are,"" Lovaas said. Airplane passengers can take steps to cushion the impact of a delay or lower the chance of getting on a delayed flight, Boyd said. Passengers should only choose connection flights that depart at least an hour after their first plane's scheduled landing, he said. Also, he said, people who book a flight just a day or two in advance should look at weather forecasts. ""If there's bad weather in Chicago, don't go through Chicago"" if you don't have to, Boyd said. Von Lipinski's recommendation, besides trying to avoid busier airports, is to treat airline workers with respect. ""The agents have a lot of discretion, and they're human beings. If you treat them like dirt and are screaming [because of a delay], you know what the result is going to be,"" he said. ""If you [treat them well], you'll probably find they'll be willing to help you.""

"(CNN) -- A convicted murderer who was pardoned this month in a controversial move by outgoing Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, has been found in Wyoming, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood announced Monday. Joseph Ozment was served with papers at a hotel in Laramie, Wyoming, where he had been staying under another name, his office said. As he was fleeing in his girlfriend's car, Ozment bumped an officer and sped from the parking lot. He later returned to the hotel on foot, denying he had been behind the wheel, Hood said. The officer was not seriously hurt. Ozment's whereabouts had been unknown since he was picked up by his mother on January 8 after his release. ""We said we would find him, and we did,"" said Hood. ""Now, we will let the court decide what happens from here."" Ozment is one of four convicted murderers Barbour pardoned this month. He did not appear at a court hearing in a case challenging the pardons. Hood has said officials wanted to serve Ozment with a document telling him to appear in court. If he does not comply, a judge has the authority to hold him in contempt, the attorney general's office said. A Jackson, Mississippi, judge is expected to hear the case this week. As he closed out his second term as governor, Barbour granted ""full pardons"" -- meaning the convict's record is effectively wiped clean -- to more than 200 people found guilty of a variety of crimes. All four of the convicted murderers he pardoned were serving life sentences and worked as trusties at the governor's mansion. The move stirred outrage among relatives of the pardoned murderers' victims. ""It's just an every minute, constant, in the back of your mind, where is he? What is he doing?"" said Mary McAbee, sister of Rick Montgomery, a store clerk shot to death by Ozment in 1992. Ozment pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. ""I'm fearful. He's a cold-blooded murderer to do what he's done, and if he thinks that he may go back to prison, what's he got to lose?"" she said. Hood has been particularly outspoken, earlier this month calling the pardons ""a slap in the face to everyone in law enforcement and (saying) Gov. Barbour should be ashamed."" The attorney general is questioning the pardons for ""failure to sufficiently meet the publication requirements of the Mississippi Constitution,"" his office said. Late Monday, Hood spoke to CNN's ""AC360,"" slamming the former governor and questioning the motives behind his pardons. ""He ran the office of the governor as if it was Mississippi in the 1950s,"" said Hood. He said many of the inmates Barbour pardoned came from influential families or had connections to the Republican party. ""There's not any logical explanation other than it was just a whim, and by doing it on a whim at the last moment that's how he violated our Constitution,"" Hood said. Barbour has defended his pardons. On Friday, he appeared on CNN's ""John King USA,"" saying Ozment and the others have been rehabilitated. ""He has no obligation to do anything. He's been pardoned. He's a free man,"" Barbour said. CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report.","NEW: Mississippi AG Jim Hood slams then-Gov. Haley Barbour .

"(CNN) -- U.S. immigration officials, testing controversial new protocols that give them discretion to ""administratively close"" immigration cases instead of taking them to court, have recommended that about 14% of the nearly 12,000 cases reviewed thus far be closed, allowing those people to remain in the United States. Of the 11,682 immigration cases reviewed in two test cities -- Baltimore and Denver -- officials have recommended closing 1,667 cases, provided they pass a final background check. The Department of Homeland Security cautioned the numbers are preliminary, and do not reflect the ultimate number that will be closed. ""For a variety of reasons, including the results of background checks, the final results of the pilot programs will likely differ from these preliminary numbers,"" Department of Homeland Security official Kim Baronof wrote in a memo obtained by CNN. If the 14% were to hold consistent for the 300,000 cases pending before the immigration courts, approximately 42,000 immigrants would bypass the courts and be permitted to stay in the United States. The Obama administration has touted the use of ""prosecutorial discretion"" as ""smart and effective immigration enforcement,"" saying it will allow undocumented aliens to stay in the United States in special cases. Immigration officials who make the decisions must consider a long list of factors, such as whether the undocumented immigrant served in the U.S. military, has roots in the community or serves as care provider for a person in need. Prior administrations used similar discretion in vetting cases, Obama administration officials have said. But critics call the program a ""backdoor amnesty program,"" saying the administration is trying to accomplish through executive fiat what it could not accomplish legislatively. ""If these results play out nationwide, tens of thousands of illegal immigrants will benefit and tens of thousands of Americans will find it harder to get jobs. How can the Obama administration justify granting work authorization to illegal immigrants when so many American citizens don't have jobs?"" said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The administration said the new policy gives immigration officials guidelines on which immigration cases to pursue, with the highest priority being on people who pose a danger to public safety or national security, or who are egregious immigration law violators. But the program is still in its infancy, and will face questions from both supporters and opponents, including why there is a discrepancy in approvals in Baltimore, where about 9.7% of the cases were administratively closed, and Denver, where 16% were closed. DHS told Congress it will brief congress members once the pilot program is completed.","Pilot program looks at effect of new protocols on immigrants in two cities .

"(CNN) -- Nanci Griffith wanted to look on the bright side. Nanci Griffith, who says she's ""fed up with negativity,"" was revitalized by the election of Barack Obama. And who could blame her? In the past decade, Griffith -- perhaps best known for her Grammy-winning 1993 album, ""Other Voices, Other Rooms"" -- had faced a political climate she didn't agree with, as well as recovery from thyroid and breast cancer, which she was diagnosed with in the late '90s. Songwriting had become a struggle for the singer with the gentle, crystalline voice. ""It was ... horrific,"" she said simply. However, with her latest album, ""The Loving Kind"" (Rounder), Griffith is as focused and passionate as she has been in years. Sparked by the changes in her life and American politics, she said, music has been vital to her personal resurgence. ""It was nice to focus on things outside of my body. Music has always done that for me,"" she said. Describing herself as someone who was ""fed up with negativity,"" Griffith was equally inspired by her fellow countrymen. ""[The] American people will not let this country collapse,"" she said. The idea motivated her to look at her country's dark path of injustice not so long ago, stories that worked their way into her songwriting. ""In some ways, I'm just a journalist. I [want] my audience to hear these stories,"" she said. CNN spoke with Griffith from her home in Nashville, Tennessee. CNN: Being a folk singer and your views being what they are, was it tougher or maybe easier to write songs from 2000 to 2008? Nanci Griffith: It was very difficult for me. I was hurt by the direction my country was going in. And then, after [the 2008 election], everything came spilling out. Things came along like the Mildred and Richard Loving case (""The Loving Kind""), where Mildred died, and I read her obituary. [The Lovings were a couple whose interracial marriage was against the law in Virginia at the time.] That was such an inspiration. ... Just wondering why I never knew about this and how important that case is currently with equality in marriage. Little things. Bit by bit, my heart started to open up again, and I could write! CNN: Had you ever gone through that before? Griffith: No, never in my life. I've always been a very prolific writer. CNN: Now, what about writing in the age of Obama? Griffith: (laughs) It feels great! People may be down on their luck, financially. But I see so much optimism about the direction of the country and [general] openness. CNN: Now, in addition to ""The Loving Kind,"" there are other songs based on actual events on this record. Tell me about ""Not Innocent Enough."" Griffith: That's based on Philip Workman's case in Memphis [Tennessee]. He was robbing a Wendy's -- was a heroin addict -- and police came in, and an officer was killed. Now, Workman didn't kill him; it was friendly fire. Workman was convicted anyway and executed. I'm a total abolitionist when it comes to the death penalty, but this case really stunned me, because I feel like this country has evolved enough to where we shouldn't have to live with the death penalty. CNN: Is it hard as a writer/musician to inhabit those songs, knowing that they are actual events? Griffith: Not really. I feel like, in some ways, I'm just a journalist. I don't express my opinion [in the songs], necessarily. But it's important to me that my audience hear these stories. I want as many people to know about Loving v. Virginia as possible. CNN: Do you feel like it's a more palatable way to become aware of a story like that when a song is attached to it? Griffith: I do. I've been informed many times through music. Pete Seeger, Odetta, Dave Van Ronk, Bruce Springsteen ... so many folk songwriters. It's all around you. CNN: The song ""Still Life"" -- I suspect that's about President George W. Bush? Griffith: It's about people like him. This country is full of them, and especially my home state of Texas. It's a [perspective on] people who go through life getting away with everything. CNN: Do you feel a sense of vindication with President Obama's election, or at least a sense that things are moving in a direction you're in favor of? Griffith: I hope so. Right now, he is my hero. So is his wife. CNN: What in your past steered you into a topical songwriter? Griffith: I was always more interested in story songs, things with a point of view ... and things that informed me. CNN: Is there a different process of writing those topical songs versus a song like ""Up Against the Rain,"" which is clearly more personal? Griffith: There is a burden to writing [those topical songs]: You better have your facts straight. When you're writing a personal song like ""Rain,"" it's straight from your heart and seems to just flow. CNN: ""Sing"" seems like it would fit that description. Does that song sum up your life in a way? Griffith: Many have asked that, but I was actually inspired to write that by watching an interview with Shania Twain where she said it would not have mattered if she remained a lounge act for her whole career. It's not something you choose. It's just what you do.","Nanci Griffith's new album is ""The Loving Kind""

"MINQIN, China (CNN) -- Switching on the electric pump next to an old well, Ma Junhe waited in the glowing morning sun as water flew into the tank mounted on a donkey cart. Environmentalist Ma Junhe waters saplings at his ecological forest site in Minqin, China. ""Thirty years ago, you could pump water here from 3 meters below,"" he lamented. ""Now we are pumping it from 80 meters below."" The sinking underground water table is testimony to the desertification that has been threatening the survival of Minqin, an oasis town precariously sandwiched between two large, expanding natural deserts in western China. Other alarming signs abound in this poor rural county of 310,000 farmers in Gansu Province, where the average annual income hovers around $500. Over-extraction has turned underground water in many places too salty and alkaline for drinking or irrigation, prompting some experts to call for moving half of Minqin's population elsewhere. A lake the size of 40,000 soccer fields has completely dried up, leaving countless clamshells scattered on the sandy lakebed the only evidence of the once-flourishing aquatic life. For Ma, 27, these jarring images serve as a daily reminder of an urgent mission: rescuing his hometown from the encroaching sands. ""Many trees were cut down in the 1980's to make way for large-scale land exploitation, while we were losing water from upstream because of drought,"" he said. ""The environment started to deteriorate rapidly."" After high school Ma had traveled across southwestern China as a pharmaceutical salesman. The lush green and moist air in that region presented a stark contrast to the increasingly dusty and barren scenery in Minqin, turning him to an unlikely environmentalist. In 2005 Ma returned home and created a web site titled ""Saving Minqin."" Two years later he signed an ambitious agreement with his native village, taking over 27 hectares of arid land for reforestation. ""This place used to be a forest when my grandfather was young,"" he reminisced. ""You would disappear in the tall trees if you walked in here."" On this bright morning, Ma followed a pair of donkeys as they pulled two full tanks of water slowly across a harsh landscape dominated by an immense expanse of sand. The wheelbarrows stopped at Ma's ecological forest site a short trek away, where patches of green are already breaking the monotony of yellow. ""We have planted these suosuo (saxauls) on five hectares of land,"" Ma pointed at what looked like were mere scrub on the ground. ""They are such hardy trees that they can survive on the meager rainfall we get here."" Even this tough plant requires some help under the unusually dry weather this year, however. Armed with buckets and shovels, Ma and other volunteers have been painstakingly watering their young trees once a month. ""So far 90 percent of the saplings have survived,"" Ma said. ""Every time I see them grow, I feel a sense of great accomplishment."" ""When the trees grow to 4 to 5 meters tall, they will be able to shield nearby farmland from the sand blown over by wind -- or even improve the climate on site."" For now, Ma is focusing on receiving official blessing for his planned environmental NGO by the end of the year, which he hopes will make fund raising an easier task. Planting and caring for trees in the desert has proven too costly to rely solely on small donations. The annual price tag of $3,500 is more than half of what Ma makes a year from his day job. ""I have been trying to find a way to support myself financially while allowing me to work on the forest at the same time,"" he said. Despite the personal challenges, Ma is heartened by the receptive audience he has found both on the Internet and in his hometown. More than 200 volunteers have signed up to participate in the eco-forest project. Some showed up amid a major dust storm more than a year ago to plant the first batch of saplings. Many locals have also expressed support to Ma, perceiving the long-term effect of his endeavor in preventing them from becoming so-called ecological refugees. ""When people retreat, the desert advances,"" Ma noted. ""So it's better to let people stay where they are."" ""Most people have lived here for generations. Moving away would be painful for them, especially for the elderly."" Ma sees a unique opportunity this year in drawing more attention to his cause as the government emphasizes environmental protection in keeping its promise to hold a ""Green Olympics"" in Beijing. But Ma doubts the authorities' ad hoc approach -- such as shutting down factories and construction sites to reduce air pollution -- would work in combating desertification. ""You can't solve an environmental problem through a temporary mass campaign,"" he said, adding that environmentalists need to address people's attitude first and foremost. ""Desertification is scary, but it's even scarier if you don't care about the environment -- that's the desertification of the mind.""

Cathy Freeman in 2000: Australia's pride lights up Sydney with a golden smile. Freeman lights up Sydney: At the time, the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, were declared the best Olympics ever.

"(CNN) -- Rauf Denktas, the first president of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, died Friday in Nicosia after a long illness, the self-declared republic's current leader announced. Denktas, 87, was instrumental in the independence of Turkish Cyprus, which, outside of Turkey, is not recognized internationally. He became its first president in 1983 and was re-elected in 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000. ""Our sorrow is huge ... and it will be very hard for us,"" said his son, Serdar Denktas. ""We will try to overcome this sorrow with respect to his memory and with patience. ... He left us, Turkish Cypriots, and people of Anatolia as orphans, but he met with heroes who made this land a nation."" Turkish troops invaded Cyprus in 1974 in response to a coup, engineered by Greece. The island remains divided despite years of efforts to resolve the deadlock. The southern part of the island joined the European Union on its own after unity efforts failed. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed his condolences to the family and his supporters. ""Mr. Denktas was a long-serving and historic Turkish Cypriot leader with whom the United Nations had a long relationship in the framework of U.N.-facilitated talks for the reunification of Cyprus and related to its peacekeeping responsibilities on the island,"" a statement from Ban's spokesperson said. Denktas was born in Baf, Cyprus, in 1924 and was educated in London. The lawyer eventually became active in political affairs. Outside of politics, Denktas was known for his photography, mostly of nature, and for his writings.","NEW: U.N. leader laments death .

"(CNN) -- Occupy activists tossed pipes, bottles, burning flares and other objects Saturday at Oakland police, who responded by using tear gas and smoke grenades and arresting more than 100 demonstrators, city and police officials said. Oakland has been a flash point of the Occupy movement since October when police used tear gas to break up demonstrators who refused to leave downtown. One demonstrator, a Marine veteran of the war in Iraq, suffered a skull fracture after being hit with a police projectile, according to a veteran's group. Police said they acted after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers. On Saturday, police made mass arrests following an afternoon clash with protesters near the Kaiser Convention Center and then later outside a downtown YMCA, according to a police statement. The tension began Saturday around noon when about 250 activists gathered in Frank Ogawa Plaza. They were joined later by another 200 people as they marched around the city. Police said the protesters ""began tearing down perimeter fences around"" the Kaiser center around 2:30 p.m., with officers ordering the protesters to leave the area about 20 minutes later. ""The City of Oakland welcomes peaceful forms of assembly and freedom of speech, but acts of violence, property destruction and overnight lodging will not be tolerated,"" the statement said. On its Twitter feed, Oakland police wrote that people near the YMCA were being arrested for unlawful assembly. Police claimed, too, that parts of the Oakland Museum and Kaiser Center were ""severely impacted,"" with people cutting and tearing fences. Occupy protesters also blocked traffic at major intersections and attacked a KTVU television truck, damaging the truck and breaking windows, the station said. No injuries were reported. By nightfall, Occupy protesters moved toward Oakland City Hall, according to the group's Twitter feed. ""Amazing day. We didnt get in the building, but fought like our future depended on it,"" the group tweeted. Posts on Occupy Oakland's Twitter feed claim that police met the protesters ""with munitions and violence."" One read: ""#OccupyOakland being teargassed smoked bombed & shot at w rubber bullets."" Oakland police said they used only smoke and tear gas. They did so after warning activists who had begun ""destroying construction equipment and fencing"" around the Kaiser center, authorities said. Officers were ""pelted"" with bottles, metal pipes, rocks and burning flares, according to another police statement released earlier in the day. While there was no immediate word on injuries to protesters, Oakland police said that three of their officers were hurt in the earlier clash. After that incident, roughly 500 activists returned to Ogawa Plaza, according to a police statement. Aerial video footage showed them later on the move and a post on Occupy Oakland's Twitter feed indicated they were planning to march to a ""second building"" -- an apparent reference to the YMCA. While touting the action as ""Move-In Day"" on their website, occupyoaklandmoveinday.org, organizers did not state what ""large, vacant"" building they planned to occupy. They also acknowledged that ""like the encampment at Oscar Grant Plaza, the building move-in is not legal."" But the group said the move was necessary, in part because ""since November, the city of Oakland and its police force have made it impossible for us to meet, to serve food, and to provide a place for people to stay."" ""Occupy Oakland is about people providing for themselves and for others, since it is clear that the system can no longer provide for them,"" the group said on its website. ""It is a place where people who are fed up can come together and develop new forms of struggle."" In a letter to Mayor Jean Quan, the city council and the Oakland police department, protesters threatened several actions if authorities try to ""evict us again."" They included ""blockading the airport indefinitely, occupying City Hall indefinitely, shutting down the Oakland ports"" and getting help from the activist hacking group known as Anonymous. In mid-December, Occupy protesters shut down the Oakland port terminal. Following October's clashes with protesters, Police Chief Howard Jordan said ""all allegations of misconduct and excessive uses of forces are being thoroughly investigated by internal and external investigative sources,"" according to a letter posted on the department's website. The website also solicits ""input ... about police interactions with protesters during the Occupy Oakland protests."" People are asked to contact the independent investigator who is looking into authorities' actions in October and November 2011. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","NEW: More than 100 protesters are arrested after they enter a downtown Oakland YMCA building .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- If there's one thing that makes Beijing an enticing city to both local and expatriate Beijingers alike, it's the food. Wangfujing Snack Street offers all sorts of exotic food, including sea horse. China's capital offers something for everyone -- from cheap street stalls to five-star gourmet eateries. Variety is the key -- from the more obvious delicacies such as fried fish, to things that are, well, a little more exotic. One great place in Beijing that offers both is Wangfujing Snack Street, in Dongcheng district. An ornate blue and gold archway marks the start of the street, which even at midday is already a bustling hive of hungry locals and curious tourists. Enticing smells swirl around continuously, as colorful characters shout out invitations to try their food. One guy, dressed in a red silk robe and black skullcap, sings out an invitation while holding a fan in one hand and his pigtail in the other. The type of food is extensive. Due to years of intermigration, almost every province is represented. There are lamb kebabs from Xinjiang, noodles from Gansu and spicy beef from Sichuan. And it's cheap: A stick of kebabs can be had for just 3 RMB (40 cents). There's also a lot for the sweet tooth, such as candy-covered apples in an array of vibrant colors, and whole coconuts filled with sweet water. But while the street's food is mostly conventional, there are also plenty of snacks on offer for the more adventurous. ""Welcome, where are you from?"" asks a friendly teenager, as he dangles a skewer of live scorpions in front of my eyes. ""Would you like to try? Only 8 RMB."" I'm too mesmerized by the scorpions' jiggling legs and snapping claws to offer a reply. He quickly shows me some of his other products for sale. They include sea horse (25 RMB), cicadas (5 RMB) and starfish (20 RMB). All are cooked by frying in oil, and can be accompanied by a variety of different sauces. Wangfujing Snack Street is a treasure, but for those who want to try something even a little more exotic, it might be worth jumping in a taxi for a 10-minute ride to Dongsishitiao Street, also in Dongcheng. The restaurant, Guo Li Zhuang (""strength inside a pot""), is unique in that it claims to be China's only specialty penis restaurant. It was started back in 2000 by a father-and-son team who also happen to be Chinese traditional doctors. ""They both used to buy a lot of different food products to eat, such as animal penis for good health,"" explains restaurant manager Nancy Lee.  Watch Nancy Lee discuss the food offerings available » . ""Then they thought, if we are spending so much money buying this food, why not open up a restaurant that would benefit ourselves and friends? So it's not so much a business-oriented as a health-oriented idea."" The restaurant is formal and divided up into private dining booths. Any preconceptions of drunken customers making lewd jokes about the food choices quickly diminish. The menu is quite exhaustive -- and there are other choices to consider, including seafood, flowers, bean products and wild mushrooms. But there's one main focus. ""We serve the penis from nine different animals,"" says Lee. ""They are cow, sheep, dog, donkey, horse, deer, yak, snake and seal."" They are usually prepared in a hot pot or stir-fried, and one penis, according to traditional Chinese medicine, should be shared by three people. The meat dishes can be accompanied by assorted sauces such as lemon soy and chili soy, and any number of vegetable platters. The food, especially in a country with such inexpensive dining prices as China, isn't cheap. ""The average cost per person to dine here is about 500 RMB ($73),"" explains Lee. ""Our clientele is usually made up of government officials and wealthy businessmen."" Perhaps a one-of-a-kind experience they probably won't forget.","Beijing's culinary offerings range from street food to upscale restaurants .

"(CNN) -- An update rolling out Tuesday for the Xbox Live network aims to do what Microsoft has been teasing for a while -- turn a platform designed primarily for video games into one that will be the major hub for all television viewing. Microsoft promises the update, which it calls ""the future of TV,"" can ""transform every Xbox 360 into an all-in-one device to enjoy your entertainment."" ""The update is another huge step toward realizing our vision of bringing you all your entertainment, shared with the people you care about, in an easy way,"" Marc Whitten, Microsoft's corporate vice president for Xbox Live, wrote on the official Microsoft blog. The Xbox was the first gaming console to include Netflix and has since added entertainment partners such as ESPN, Hulu Plus, AT&T U-verse and last.fm. But Microsoft, hoping a bevy of new apps will up the ante, is adding content from 40 new partners while making existing content easier to view. One of the free update's key new features will be a voice-control interface that will let users retrieve videos, television channels, games or other content simply by asking for it. The feature combines the Xbox 360's hands-free Kinect system with technology from Microsoft's Bing search engine to hunt down the content. Primarily billed as a gaming tool, Kinect uses a 3-D video camera and voice recognition to let the user interact with the TV screen without a controller. The new partners, or updated apps, to be unveiled Tuesday include content from ESPN, Hulu, Netflix and MSNBC in the United States. In the coming weeks and months, Xbox will add YouTube, Best Buy's CinemaNow, HBO Go, Major League Baseball and Comcast's Xfinity On Demand. Time Warner, HBO's parent company, also owns CNN. Microsoft said the update will also add social features, from voting on who you think will win the big game to tools letting you notify friends when you're tackling a multiplayer game they can join. At a time when technology heavyweights such as Apple and Google are trying to gain footholds in the interactive TV market, some analysts are saying Microsoft has become the player to beat. ""Microsoft has just built and delivered it: A single box that ties together all the content you want, made easily accessible through a universal, natural, voice-directed search,"" wrote James McQuivey of Forrester Research. ""This is now the benchmark against which all other living room initiatives should be compared."" With 57 million Xbox 360s already in folks' living rooms, and 35 million of them connected to Xbox Live, McQuivey predicts that adoption of the new features ""will spread quickly and with devastating effect.""","Xbox Live update promises an all-in-one device for TV viewing .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Despite a five-year hiring surge, the Federal Aviation Administration is at risk of not having enough senior air traffic controllers for its busiest and most critical facilities, where they are needed to run operations and train less-experienced controllers, according to the agency's independent inspector general. Nearly one-third of the senior controllers at the nation's most critical facilities are eligible for retirement, according to a report by the FAA's office of inspector general. At a Dallas-Ft. Worth FAA facility, 65% of the controllers are eligible for retirement, it says. Meanwhile, trainees are quitting jobs at high rates at those same demanding, high-volume facilities, according to the report. Between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2010, critical facilities lost 40% of their trainees to attrition, well above the national average of 24%, the report says. The problems now are a legacy of the 1981 air traffic controller strike. That year, President Ronald Reagan fired more than 11,000 controllers after they refused to return to work, and the FAA hired thousands of predominantly young controllers to replace them. In recent years, those controllers have become eligible for retirement, forcing the FAA to ramp up its hiring and training programs. The inspector general's report looks at 21 facilities deemed ""critical"" to the nation because of the high volume of air traffic they control. The list includes several control towers at the nation's busiest airports -- Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson, Chicago O'Hare and the New York area's Kennedy, Newark and LaGuardia fields -- as well as several regional and high-altitude facilities. The FAA said Monday it has ""progressively improved"" hiring, training and certification of new controllers and has increased its ranks of senior controllers, known as ""certified professional controllers. ""More than 5,000 Certified Professional Controllers have been produced over the past five years as part of a hiring and training plan designed to ensure safe and efficient operations,"" the agency said in a statement. ""The FAA continues to meet overall goals for hiring, training time to certification and number of certified controllers."" The FAA told the inspector general's office it recognizes the ""failure rate"" of new controllers is unacceptably high at some facilities and is addressing the issue. The office said that while the FAA is getting better at allocating staffing, ""ot still has not provided the training support these complex facilities need to slow attrition and ensure the success of new hires."" It gave five recommendations, but said the FAA has satisfied three of them and is taking steps to address the other two.","The situation tracks back to the 1981 air traffic controller strike .

"(Good.is) -- By far, my greatest interests in life are words and humor. I'm obsessed with both, which is why my favorite comedian is the late George Carlin -- the funny man most obsessed with how we talk. Nothing has ever floated the boats of my two obsessions more than a good Carlin DVD or book. Until now. The publication of ""Green's Dictionary of Slang"" -- a product of 17 years of work that make it the largest slang dictionary ever published in English -- is a glorious event for anyone who loves words and likes to laugh. Covering slang from the United States to England, New Zealand, and beyond, Jonathon ""Mr. Slang"" Green records and documents more than 100,000 words and idioms in an OED-like, quotation-packed historical dictionary. Those terms range from the crude (""sweat bird turds,"" meaning ""work hard"") to the subtle (""give someone the mitten"" -- end a relationship) and everywhere in between. As Green says, slang is ""...vibrant, creative, witty, and open to seemingly infinite re-invention. It is voyeuristic, amoral, libertarian, and libertine. It is vicious. It is cruel. It is self-indulgent. It is funny. It is fun."" So is this dictionary. Folks have struggled to define slang for centuries. One of the most accepted definitions is ""Historical Dictionary of American Slang"" editor Jonathan Lighter's claim -- ""The aim and chief function of slang is to lower and disavow the dignity of discourse.""

Michael Adams -- author of ""Slang: The People's Poetry"" -- offers a complementary view: ""... it's not just that slang lowers dignity, but that dignity is under criticism in slang ... To the extent that everyday speech is boring, slang is meant to elevate discourse, not lower it."" As for Jonathon Green, in the intro to his massive new dictionary, he writes, ""I would call slang a 'counter-language,' the desire of human beings, when faced by a standard version, of whatever that might be, to come up with something different, perhaps parallel, perhaps oppositional."" That drive to coin words seems as biologically driven as many of the topics slang usually names. As Green notes, ""...the basic concerns remain consistent in slang as they do in much that is human: sex, money, intoxication, fear (of others), aggrandizement (of oneself)."" Within any of those topics, the range of vocabulary is astounding. Take sex. One my favorite euphemisms -- ""Ugandan discussion"" -- is included, as well as many variations on themes, such as ""playing."" You can ""play at"" itch-buttocks, all fours, belly-to-belly, blindman's bluff, bo-peep, fathers and mothers, and handie-dandie. Good: More college grads are taking nonprofit jobs. But is it just a fad? You can also play ""night baseball,"" ""the first game ever played,"" or ""Mr. Wobbly hides his helmet."" The most romantic term might be ""bouncing refrigerators."" I'm going to add that to the hobbies list on my dating profile immediately. Beyond sex, the range of terms and types of terms is enough to make your top-hamper (head) spin. There are comic book-y sound effects, like ""kerplunk,"" ""kaplunk,"" and ""ka-plonk."" There's British rhyming slang, including ""Dick Van Dyke"" (bike), ""two eyes of blue"" (too true), and ""Meryl Streep"" (sleep). There are indefinite words, such as ""thingahoochie"" and ""thingsmadoodle,"" plus exclamations like ""Holy creeping Jesus!"" Pop culture is well-represented, as ""go to the mattresses"" is traced to Maria Puzo's The Godfather in 1969, and ""neo maxi zoom dweebie"" was coined in The Breakfast Club in 1985. College slang appears often, nowhere as blatantly as in ""undue perversity"" -- a nickname for Purdue University. Speaking of education -- and as a teacher myself -- I love the term ""gerund-grinder"": an 18th century insult for a schoolteacher. That's not even the tip of the tip of the slangberg: Green's lexical buffet seems to go on forever. Of course, even the biggest and best slang dictionary ever can't be complete or perfect. I think Lighter's Historical Dictionary of American Slang (HDAS) is a slightly better word book -- in theory, if not fact. Sadly, that incredible project has never been finished, and what is published is a tad out of date. I was also stunned by some omissions in Green's. How can ""assmunch"" and ""meh"" miss the cut when so many obscurities are listed? Then again, I'm sure every English speaker knows some slang terms that didn't get scooped up. Good: Low-tech project inspires community engagement in New Orleans . When looking at such a massive, well-documented collection of words, griping about what's missing is a tad ungrateful: like dissing Christina Hendricks for not being voluptuous enough. It's a shame George Carlin didn't live to see this amazing work, which is awesome in the ""causing awe"" and ""whoa, dude"" senses. In addition to his prolific comedy, Carlin was a bit of a lexicographer himself -- Green cites some of Carlin's 2,443 Dirty Words several times. I bet Carlin would appreciate Green's spin on slang: . ""To me its greatest charm is that at its heart, even its most obscene and gutter-dwelling heart, it is subversive. This is not political subversion -- slang is above politics -- but a subversion of the English language itself. And by subverting English, it subverts the givens of the world that English informs."" Carlin, a lifelong subversive and committed atheist, once speculated that his soul might go to a garage in Buffalo. I hope someone finds that garage and sends a copy of Green's massive record of our naughty mother tongue there -- stat. He would love it. © 2010 Good.

"(CNN) -- With many focused on the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, a South Carolina military college said Saturday it regrets not pursuing an allegation against a camp counselor further than it did. The Citadel released details on one of its alumni, Louis Neal ""Skip"" ReVille, who faces charges including criminal sexual conduct with a child. In 2007, the college received an allegation that five years earlier, ReVille invited two campers at The Citadel Summer Camp into his room to watch pornography. They did not touch each other, but engaged in sexual activity, the college said. ""Though the general counsel was unable to corroborate the accusation, the college continued its investigation with the camper's family, who made it clear they were very concerned about maintaining their privacy and not having their names publicized. ""Despite the concerns of the family, whose right to privacy was foremost on our minds, we regret that we did not pursue this matter further,"" Citadel President Lt. Gen John. W. Rosa and Doug Snyder, chairman of The Citadel Board of Visitors, wrote in a statement. The Citadel, in Charleston, South Carolina, said a review of ReVille's records at the time revealed no other complaints, and his file included a clean background check. He was a highly respected cadet and denied the accusation, the college said. Four years later, Reville faces various charges, including criminal sexual conduct and committing or attempting lewd acts on a minor. He was arrested late last month. His attorney, Craig Jones Jr., has said his client is sorry for what he did, according to CNN affiliate WCBD-TV. Jones declined to comment to CNN Saturday on the Citadel statement. WCBD also reported that ReVille, 32, was the upper school principal at Coastal Christian Prep in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, and had held a number of positions over the years working with area children. ""Hopefully the way he's cooperated, that's one way he can hopefully show ... do what he can to help the victims to whatever extent he can,"" Jones said, according to WCBD. ""There's no way that, obviously, he can repair the damage that's been done.""

"(CNN) -- The United States is vacating an air base in Pakistan at Islamabad's request following a NATO attack that killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers. U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter told Pakistan's Waqt TV on Monday that the United States is leaving Shamsi Air Base in Balochistan Province southwest of Quetta. U.S. drones have taken off from the base and refueled there for operations against Islamic militants, according to sources familiar with U.S. drone operations in Pakistan. The order to clear out of the base comes in the aftermath of a November 26 incident in which a NATO airstrike killed 24 Pakistani troops. According to two U.S. officials familiar with an initial assessment of the incident, U.S. commandos were working alongside Afghan troops when they came under fire. The troops did not tell Pakistani authorities about the mission ahead of time because they had thought it would take place entirely within Afghanistan, the officials said. U.S. and Pakistani officials said Friday there were conversations between the sides before the strike, but they differed on the content of those conversations. A Pakistani military spokesman said the attack hit the wrong target. A probe, headed by U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Stephen Clark, is under way. The loss of the base is unlikely to have any major impact on operations in Pakistan, experts said. A U.S. official said Sunday that the ""loss of access to this base would not lessen capabilities, as it has served primarily as a back-up capability for quite a while now."" The United States flies drones out of Kandahar in nearby Afghanistan, so the impact should not be enormous, said CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. Still, there would be an impact, said Anthony Cordesman, who holds the Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""You're talking potentially 40 to 60 minutes' added reaction time,"" he said. But the issue is broader than simply closing an airbase, Cordesman said. ""It's what Pakistan intends to do about its airspace,"" he said. ""If it's saying, in addition to the base closing, that it will no longer cooperate to allow the United States to use Pakistani airspace and there will be no cooperation on targeting and no quid pro quo where we would use systems to hit at insurgents or extremists which were threats to Pakistan as well as Afghanistan, then it goes much further,"" he said. ""It also basically means that, if you're going to do this, you're clearly violating Pakistani airspace and, if you're going to do it, you may have to rely much more on stealth."" International law is clear, he noted. ""You can't, in theory, send an intelligence aircraft over somebody's airspace. Period. The fact that people do it all the time doesn't make it legal. If you go beyond that, and the vehicle or airplane shoots something, that's an act of war."" Former CIA covert operations officer Mike Baker said that, from a logistical point of view, closing the airbase is ""irritating, inconvenient, concerning."" But, he added, ""It won't impact our ability to strike at a target."" Baker, who is president of Diligence LLC, a global intelligence and security firm, described the base closure as ""one more step down this dysfunctional road with the Pakistanis,"" but predicted that ""cooperation between CIA and other intelligence portions of our military and the Pakistanis"" will continue. ""Regardless of what happens in the headlines, there is an operational level of activity that continues to move forward because, ultimately, it is in the Pakistanis' best interest to continue to try to counter some of the extremists' activity."" High-level Pakistani officials have supported, quietly, the U.S. drone campaign for years, he said. ""They've been playing the same game that any other nation will play -- they want a little bit of plausible deniability."" In other words, when public opinion turns against the drone attacks, the officials will turn against them, too, Baker said. ""Once they feel threatened from their own population because of their support and cooperation from the United States, that's when they'll turn on us,"" he said. ""Will they decide a drone strike in Pakistani airspace without permission is an act of war? Doubtful."" U.S. officials have long prepared for Plan B in Pakistan, he said. ""If you have facilities in any country where you have a somewhat occasional volatile relationship, you're always looking for alternatives,"" he said. The issue of U.S. and other NATO forces entering Pakistan has been a sensitive topic in that country since May, when U.S. commandos killed al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad without Pakistani leaders' consent. NATO has called last month's casualties ""tragic."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the incident a ""tragedy"" and offered condolences. President Barack Obama called Pakistan's president Sunday to express condolences over the airstrike. He said the incident was not a deliberate attack on Pakistan, the White House said. The incident exacerbated already strained relations with Pakistan. ""Such attacks ... demonstrate complete disregard for international law and human life,"" Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said the day after the attack. Khar asked the United States to vacate the Shamsi Air Base within 15 days. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan confirmed Monday that Munter said the United States is complying with the request. On Monday, Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani said Pakistan wants to have good relations with the United States based on mutual respect and clearly defined parameters. ""I think that is doable,"" he told state-run Associated Press of Pakistan. ""I think that it won't take long."" He said that new ties being negotiated with the United States would ensure that the two countries ""respected each other's red lines"" regarding sovereignty and rules of engagement along the border. ""I think we have evolved some mechanisms, and we are ready to cooperate"" on peace efforts in Afghanistan, he said. In Washington, deputy State Department spokesman Mike Toner, referring to the cross-border incident in which two dozen Pakistani soldiers were killed, said he welcomed Gilani's remarks. ""From the very moments after this tragedy, we've been clear that this relationship is vital to U.S. national security interests, it is vital to Pakistan's national security interests, it is vital to the region's interests that we work together productively. And we are committed to addressing the issues between us and moving forward,"" he told reporters. CNN's Pam Benson, Nasir Habib, Nick Paton Walsh and Barbara Starr and journalist Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","NEW: Pakistan's prime minister says he wants good relations with the United States .

"(CNN) -- Joe Paterno was admitted to a hospital Sunday morning after fracturing his pelvis when he slipped and fell at his home the previous night, a source close to the Paterno family said. The injury will not require surgery, the source said. But since the former Penn State football coach is being treated with chemotherapy as he battles lung cancer, doctors have decided to keep him in the hospital. The source did not say which hospital Paterno, who turns 85 later this month, is in or how long he is expected to stay there. Paterno lost his job as the Nittany Lions coach last month amid criticism that he hadn't done more when a sexual assault allegation surfaced regarding his longtime defensive coordinator, Jerry Sandusky. According to a biography on a Penn State website, Paterno was born December 21, 1926, in Brooklyn, New York, and attended Brown University. He joined the Penn State football program after graduating college in 1960, taking over as the team's head coach in 1966. In late October, a Penn State win over Illinois -- the 409th in his head coaching career -- propelled Paterno past Grambling University's legendary former coach Eddie Robinson for the most in NCAA Division I history. A week later, Sandusky -- who coached at Penn State for 23 years and remained a presence on campus after his retirement in 1999 -- was arrested and charged with 40 counts tied to allegations over a 14-year period. Ten additional charges were levied this month. An investigative grand jury's summary of testimony claimed that Sandusky engaged in fondling, oral sex and anal sex with young boys. One of the allegations came from 2002, when a graduate assistant told Paterno he'd witnessed an incident in a shower inside a school athletic facility -- a story that Paterno referred to Athletic Director Tim Curley, but didn't become known to investigators until years later. Curley and Gary Schultz, a university vice president, were both charged with one count of felony perjury and one count of failure to report abuse allegations. Paterno wasn't charged, saying he did his duty by referring the allegations to his superior, according to the grand jury report. But criticism quickly mounted, and Penn State trustees dismissed Paterno and school President Graham Spanier -- who initially backed Curley and Schultz -- days after Sandusky's arrest. Just over a week after the firing, Paterno's son Scott announced that his father has a treatable form of lung cancer. The family learned of the diagnosis after Paterno's follow-up visit for a bronchial illness. CNN's Dana Garrett contributed to this report.","Paterno slipped and fell at his home on Saturday night, a source says .

"(CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama got into the Christmas spirit Saturday by helping field phone calls from excited children eagerly tracking Santa and his sleigh full of toys across the world. ""I've spotted a little dot, flashing dot that is over -- right now, Santa's sleigh is over the country of Latvia. And he's delivering toys there,"" Obama told three siblings. ""It looks like he's got all nine reindeer with him. And it looks like that sleigh is pretty full -- yep, that's what the experts here are saying."" Obama took the phone calls from Hawaii where the first family is vacationing for Christmas. She helped track Santa's toy delivery route via a Google map specially created each year by the North American Aerospace Command, also known as NORAD. A tiny Santa icon is used to show his current location while a countdown clock below the map lets users know where he'll take his sleigh next. Most of the children she spoke to were more concerned with finding out Santa's whereabouts than talking to the first lady, but one parent appeared to catch Obama by surprise when he asked, ""What do you want for Christmas this year from Santa?"" ""Oh, my goodness,"" Obama replied. ""I have what I wanted for Christmas: the president is here with us, and we're all together as a family. I think we were all praying and praying, and asking Santa, and the Tooth Fairy, and every fairy that they could think of -- that's what Malia and Sasha were doing -- that he would be able to be with us on Christmas."" The president had delayed joining his family in Hawaii until Congress passed a deal to extend the payroll tax cut. He departed Washington on Friday shortly after signing the two-month extension. The NORAD Santa tracker started by accident in 1955 when a Sears ad misprinted Santa's supposed telephone number. A child who dialed the number instead reached what was then called the Continental Air Defense Command and the commander on duty played along, beginning the tradition. For the second year in a row, Obama was one of the 1,200 volunteers who answer phone calls and e-mails from children around the world.","Michelle Obama answers phone calls for NORAD's Santa tracker .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Prosecutors detailed acts of police brutality in their presentations Wednesday at the trial of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on charges he ordered protesters killed during the country's uprising last year. One video played for the court ""shows a policeman loading a machine gun and firing directly at protesters, proving the use of live ammo,"" said Khaled Abu Bakr, a civil rights lawyer involved in the trial. Mubarak's lawyers have denied the assertion, he said. Another video presented as evidence ""shows a policeman firing a gas canister that hits a protester's face directly, causing him serious pain. Images of protesters included one of a man on the floor ""with his brain spilled on the ground,"" Abu Bakr said. The evidence presented by the prosecution includes audio recordings, videos, medical reports of victims, and excerpts from testimony given by Interior Ministry staff and officers obtained during the trial's earlier sessions, Abu Bakr said. The prosecution contends that police brutality led to many casualties among the protesters. Mubarak, who also faces corruption charges, has denied wrongdoing. The former president was wheeled into court on a stretcher after noon. He was wearing sunglasses and was covered with a green blanket, as during his previous appearances. Prosecutors are expected to focus Thursday on allegations that the former president and his sons squandered public money. Thursday is to be the final day of their three-day presentation. Abu Bakr said that opening arguments Tuesday lasted an hour, during which prosecutor Mustapha Suleiman described Mubarak as ""a tyrant who aimed to hand the rule to his younger son, Gamal, who promoted corruption in Egypt, allowing his friends and relatives to destroy the country without accountability."" Abu Bakr said he expects a verdict before January 25, the date last year that the uprising began. It ended Mubarak's 30-year rule in February. Many Egyptians have criticized the court proceedings and some worry that Mubarak may be acquitted of the murder charges. Five police officers accused of killing protesters were acquitted last week. Mubarak's health has been in question since his detention began in April, as reports of cancer and heart problems surfaced in the news media. Former Egyptian Interior Minister Habib El Adly, six of his aides and two of Mubarak's sons are also on trial on a variety of charges. The sons, Gamal and Alaa, also have pleaded not guilty. ""The defendants before you in the cage are the actual instigators and are the ones who gave police officers the order to shoot,"" prosecutor Mustapha Suleiman said, according to his spokesman, Adel Saeed. Suleiman also said that the prosecution has evidence that the regime used ""thugs"" against the protesters. The defendants are accused of killing 225 protesters and injuring more than 1,300, Saeed said. Amnesty International had estimated more than 840 protesters were killed and 6,000 injured. Saeed said his estimate was lower ""because there has been a differentiation between those killed outside police stations while attacking the precinct and those shot while protesting.""","Prosecutors show scenes of police brutality against protesters during the uprising .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether to charge England international footballer John Terry with racist abuse after receiving a full police file on the Chelsea captain. London's Metropolitan Police confirmed this week that Terry was questioned under caution last Friday over claims that he abused Anton Ferdinand of Queens Park Rangers during a match in October. The 30-year-old has strongly denied the accusation, but faces investigations by both the police and the English Football Association. He has continued to play for both club and country, including this month's friendly win against Sweden when he retained the captain's armband. ""We now have a full file on John Terry and that is now under consideration,"" a spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed to CNN on Thursday. Terry's case is one of two that have rocked English football in recent months, and came shortly before FIFA president Sepp Blatter told CNN that there is no problem with on-pitch racism.

"(CNN) -- It has become a great American tradition, an act of small-town civics, an example of direct democracy in action where citizens get to meet presidential candidates multiple times. But it is also an overhyped media circus, which helps give Iowa disproportionate influence on who gets the Republican nomination, despite the fact that no binding delegates are actually selected. The Iowa caucuses are low-turnout, high-intensity elections. There are 2.1 million registered voters in Iowa. But the total turnout for the GOP caucus in 2008 was just 118,696 people, despite the months of media hype. Mike Huckabee won the caucuses that year with nearly 41,000 votes, beating Mitt Romney by more than 10,000 votes while being outspent considerably. That 10,000-vote margin represented less than half of 1% of the entire state's electorate. Overall, the state of Iowa is representative of heartland America -- 37% registered independent, 32% Democrat and 30% Republican. But caucus-goers do not represent that political spread. Instead, 88% of GOP caucus voters in 2008 identified themselves as ""conservative,"" and only 11% described their views as moderate. Nearly two-thirds were evangelical. As a result, center-right Republican candidates who might have the best chance of winning Iowa in a general election have a hard time making inroads in the conservative caucuses. Conventional wisdom states that the top three finishers in the Iowa caucuses are all winners, with a chance to win the nomination, especially if they exceed expectations. But jowly former Sen. Fred Thompson came in third in Iowa and dropped out of the campaign. John McCain gained the endorsement of the Des Moines Register in 2008 as well as the nomination, but he didn't finish in the top three in '08 or '00. In fact, since 1980, the only Republican nonincumbent who has won the caucuses and gone on to win the presidency is George W. Bush. This year, we have a real horse race with no clear leader -- polls say establishment candidate Mitt Romney is in pole position, followed closely by libertarian Ron Paul and the surging social conservative Rick Santorum. Newt Gingrich's once commanding lead has been shrunk by more than $2 million in negative ads, most from a Romney-affiliated PAC. Rick Perry's invested his considerable campaign cash in a combination of in-state ad-buys and ground-game organization. Michele Bachmann's campaign, which once was strong enough to win a straw poll in the state, has collapsed under the weight of the candidate's considerable overreach, marked by high-level defections and rock-bottom polls. Bachmann has taken to desperately trying to compare herself to Margaret Thatcher at every stop while her campaign cites the judgment of a conservative Christian group that she is ""biblically qualified to be president"" -- whatever that's supposed to mean. One of the real questions in this caucus is whether retail politics matters as much as it used to. Mitt Romney basically dissed the state for the first 10 months of 2011, still stinging from his expensive rejection in 2008. But his well-funded campaign was able to buy aspects of a statewide organization and negative ads to tear down rivals. One of the fascinating aspects of the Romney campaign is that he seems to have a glass ceiling of 25% -- the same percent of the caucus vote he received in 2008. The other candidates have famously traded the other 75% of the vote over the past several months. If the deck is shuffled just right, with a number of other candidates in the mid-teens, Romney can win Iowa in this crowded conservative field. And if he wins Iowa on Tuesday night, his months-long double-digit lead in New Hampshire will solidify and he will be almost assured of winning the first two states, well on the way to winning the nomination. Additionally, he has the weight of precedent on his side: The front-runners who have conventional wisdom behind them tend to win the Republican nomination eventually, after the party flirts with a dark horse. But Ron Paul is a wild card. His supporters are by far the most dedicated, if not the most numerous. They will turn out come sleet or snow (though the temperature is supposed to be above average). The January 3 caucuses are smack in the middle of winter break for universities, but Paul's younger supporters might just come back early to vote for their hero. If Rick Santorum's recent momentum continues, he can claim the evangelical mantle as the consistent social conservative alternative to Romney, the man he endorsed in 2008. He provides at least one other clear point of contrast -- Santorum has been hammering away at middle class and blue collar issues, while Romney embodies the one percent of the wealthiest Americans. The most dire scenario for Romney would be a Newt or Perry surprise surge, which the polls say seems unlikely. But either of their campaigns could come out of Iowa with new momentum and at least a real chance of winning South Carolina and possibly Florida. Three out of four states by the end of January makes a candidate extremely likely to win the party's nomination. The countdown to the Iowa caucus can now be measured in hours, instead of weeks or months. Whatever you think about the disproportionate influence this heartland state has on our politics, it cannot be ignored. The presidential election year of 2012 is here. And on Tuesday night, the race for the White House will really kick off. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","The 2012 presidential race begins Tuesday with Iowa caucuses .

Daniele de Rossi, playing as a makeshift central defender, gave mid-table Roma the lead at the Stadio Olympico in the fifth minute. The Italy international midfielder mistimed his volley from Totti's short-corner, but Arturo Vidal miskicked as he tried to prevent the ball crossing the line.

However, Juve goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon comfortably saved his former international teammate's 63rd-minute penalty. The draw left Roma in ninth place, one of four clubs on 18 points.

"(CNN) -- Chinese football club Shanghai Shenhua hope to pull off a major transfer coup by signing former France international Nicolas Anelka. Spokesman Ma Yue confirmed that talks are ongoing with the 32-year-old, who is out of favor at English Premier League side Chelsea. ""We're still negotiating over some details of the contract. If everything goes well, we'll announce it next Monday or Tuesday,"" Yue told CNN on Friday, adding that Anelka had been offered a three-year contract. Anelka has played at some of Europe's top clubs, including Spain's Real Madrid and England's Arsenal and Liverpool. His transfers so far have totaled almost Â£85 million ($133 million), making him one of the world's most expensive players in those terms. However, his questionable attitude during his early career led to him being nicknamed ""Le Sulk"" at Arsenal and being banned for 45 days at Real after refusing to train. In 2008, Anelka moved to Chelsea in a Â£15 million deal from Bolton, where he resurrected his career after a short spell in Turkey with Fenerbahce. He showed the form that led Manchester City to pay Â£13 million for his services in 2002, rebounding from his decisive penalty miss in the 2008 European Champions League final to help Chelsea win the domestic championship in 2009-10. However, he has rarely featured this season under new manager Andre Villas-Boas and is widely expected to leave Stamford Bridge during European football's January transfer window. Anelka's international career came to a controversial halt during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, when he was sent home in disgrace after clashing with coach Raymond Domenech. He was given an 18-match ban after refusing to apologize, but said he had already decided to retire from the national team. Shenhua owner Zhu Jun said former France international Jean Tigana will become the club's new coach, according to the Shanghai Daily website. ""Tigana should be in the city by the middle of this month. He had already made a one-year coaching plan for the team,"" Zhu said. The 56-year-old, who quit French club Bordeaux in May, has previously Turkey's Besiktas, Englanhd's Fulham and Lyon and Monaco in his homeland. Shenhua finished 11th in the 16-team Chinese Super League this year, having been runners-up in 2005, 2006 and 2008.","Nicolas Anelka in talks with Shanghai Shenhua, according to the Chinese club .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- All U.S. forces have vacated a military base in Pakistan, meeting a deadline set by Islamabad after a NATO airstrike killed dozens of soldiers, local military officials said Sunday. Pakistan requested U.S. forces to vacate the Shamsi Airbase by December 11 in response to the November 26th attack that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers in the northwest of the country. Fifty-one American personnel have left the air base, taking drone planes and other equipment with them, according to the Pakistani military officials. They did not want to be named because they are not authorized to talk to the media. Pakistan military has taken over the base, the officials said. Shamsi Airbase was one of two bases Pakistan provided the U.S. for their operations in the region. It was built in 1992 by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the then ruler of the United Arab Emirates.","Pakistan requests U.S. forces vacate the Shamsi Airbase by December 11 .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai put pressure on Pakistan on Wednesday to help investigate an unprecedented attack on Shiite Muslim worshippers in Kabul a day earlier, saying his country would pursue the probe ""with all the power we have."" A militant group based in Pakistan claimed responsibility for the bombing, which killed at least 56 people on Tuesday, the Shiite holy day of Ashura. ""To kill children on Ashura is to be an enemy to humanity. To kill Muslims on Ashura is to be an enemy to Islam,"" Karzai said, calling the massacre ""unique in Afghan history."" ""Lashkar-e-Jangvi has announced they are our enemies and of Afghans and Islam and humanity,"" Karzai said, while visiting a hospital to meet survivors of the attack. ""We will follow it very seriously and will definitely pursue it with the government of Pakistan, because it relates to our lives and the lives of these children lying in the hospital,"" the youngest of whom was a boy one and a half years old, he said. Karzai has not confirmed the group carried out the attack, spokesman Aimal Faizi emphasized, but based his remarks on its claim that it did. The mass-scale sectarian attack on Shiite worshipers was unlike anything the country has seen in its decade-long war -- in contrast to Iraq, where violence between Shiites and Sunnis has been a major feature of the conflict. At least 193 people were wounded in addition to those killed when a suicide bomber detonated a device at a Shiite shrine in Kabul on Tuesday, Afghan Health Ministry spokesman Kargar Norughli said. Four people also were killed in a Tuesday explosion at a roundabout on a busy street in Mazar-e Sharif, the provincial capital of Afghanistan's northern Balkh province, police official Lal Mohammad Ahmadzai said. Another 21 were wounded in that attack. ""The enemies tried to spread fear in this important holiday in the city,"" Ahmadzai said. It was not immediately clear whether the attack in Mazar-e Sharif was linked to the attack in Kabul. The U.N Security Council condemned both attacks ""in the strongest terms"" in a statement Wednesday and urged Afghanistan to hold those responsible to justice, as well as expressing its condolences to the victims. Karzai also strongly condemned an attack in Helmand province on Wednesday, he said in a statement. At least 19 people, including women and children, were killed when their bus hit a roadside mine Wednesday, said Daud Ahmadi, a spokesman for the governor of Helmand province. Their bus was traveling from provincial capital Lashkar Gah to Sangin district in the south of the restive province, he said. He said he did not know whether the civilians were the target of the roadside mine planted by the Taliban. Karzai canceled a visit to the United Kingdom after the Tuesday blasts. A spokesman for the Afghan Embassy in London said Karzai had been due in London late Tuesday from Germany but was instead flying back to Afghanistan. Megan Ellis, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Kabul, said Wednesday that an American was among the dead. She added that consular officials were in touch with the family, who would need to consent to the release of further details. The Taliban denied involvement in Tuesday's attacks. A man identifying himself as a spokesman for Lashkar-e-Jangvi al Almi, a group with links to al Qaeda and the Pakistan Taliban, made the claim of responsibility in a call to Radio Mashaal, a Pashto-language station in Pakistan sponsored by the U.S. government. The group is an offshoot of the powerful Lashkar-e-Jangvi, which has a record of high-profile suicide bombings in Pakistan, including the attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad in 2008. Afghanistan has seen previous attacks on mosques. In 2006, rioting broke out between Shiites and Sunnis at an Ashura festival in Herat, leading to several deaths. But the country has not seen sectarian attacks of the scale that occurred Tuesday. Ashura commemorates the martyrdom of Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Mohammed. Hussein's death in battle in Karbala, Iraq, in 680 is one of the events that helped create the schism between Sunnis and Shiites, the two main Muslim religious movements. Shiites are a minority presence in Afghanistan, which is predominantly Sunni. CNN's Tim Lister, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Mick Krever and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: The U.N Security Council condemns the two attacks ""in the strongest terms""

"(CNN) -- Japanese authorities are expected to announce Friday that a ""cold shutdown"" has been achieved at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That would mean the plant's crippled reactors have stayed at temperatures below the boiling point for some time. The announcement is a symbolic milestone. But experts say it will take years -- perhaps decades -- to fully clean up the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. The plume of radioactive particles that spewed from Fukushima Daiichi -- where reactor cooling systems failed in the aftermath of Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami in March -- displaced about 80,000 people who lived within a 20-kilometer (12.5-mile) radius of the plant, as well as residents of one village as far as 40 kilometers to the northwest. The government has yet to determine when those evacuated can return to their homes. Significant work -- with significant risks -- remains to be done at the plant. ""This is far from over, and the work will go on for a long time,"" Tokyo Electric Power Co. President Toshio Nishizawa told CNN this week. Citing government sources, Japan's Kyodo News agency reported Thursday that scrapping crippled reactors at the plant could take up to 40 years. In October, a spokesman for Tokyo Electric -- which owns the plant -- said temperatures in the three reactors where meltdowns occurred had already been brought down below 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit), but the company would have to maintain those conditions for some time before declaring the reactors in cold shutdown. ""They're making this out to be some big milestone, some big thing. But the reality of this is that it's not,"" said Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at U.S. nuclear power plants. ""The problem is, with these reactors and the condition that they're in, to suggest that they're in cold shutdown really doesn't do justice to the situation. They're no safer today than they were basically in June."" Officials could start removing spent fuel rods from the facility next year, but it could be up to a decade before they are able to access the reactor vessels, he said. ""They'll probably spend two or three years studying it,"" he said. Jack DeVine, who helped lead the cleanup of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant after the 1979 partial meltdown there, said the cold shutdown likely means officials may have one less thing to worry about. If they don't have to use as much water to cool the reactors, they also don't have to worry about what to do with contaminated cooling water -- one of many problems that have plagued workers at the crippled plant. ""It's not like there's a dramatic difference. It's just a gradual incremental difference that does make life easier,"" he said. The earthquake and tsunami on March 11 killed more than 15,000 people in northeastern Japan. The country was on edge for weeks as cooling systems failed and utility and government employees scrambled to prevent a nuclear catastrophe at the six-reactor Daiichi plant, located about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Hydrogen explosions blew apart the No. 1 and No. 3 reactor housings, while another hydrogen blast is suspected to have damaged the No. 2 reactor. Fires believed caused by heat from the No. 4 spent fuel pool damaged that unit's reactor building. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency eventually categorized the accident as a level-7 event -- the highest level on an international scale for nuclear disasters -- putting it on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. ""We are going to check each reactor properly and determine what is going to happen to those left,"" Nishizawa, the Tokyo Electric president, said Wednesday. Removing spent fuel rods is the next step, but officials need to further survey the area before that happens, he said. ""We are considering sending a robot into the fuel tanks to really have a good idea (about) the situation. This will be necessary when we take out the fuel,"" Nishizawa said. ""But I don't believe what we see will be 180 degrees different from our simulations. But as we say, seeing once is better than hearing 100 times, so we will have a good look at what's happening inside."" At Three Mile Island, where damage was less severe and only one reactor was affected, it took two and half years before officials were able to get inside the reactor to assess it, DeVine said. At Fukushima Daiichi, that process will likely take much longer, he said. ""I think in terms of what's ahead, it's still the daunting task that it's always been, which is first of all, figuring out where everything is. ... They're going to be searching for and finding pieces of fuel, chunks of molten material that have now cooled, through all of that rubble,"" he said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Matt Smith in Atlanta, and Licia Yee in Tokyo contributed to this report.","The announcement means temperatures have stayed below the boiling point .

"(CNN) -- If ""Can I kick it?"" provokes an almost involuntary ""Yes, you can!"" and ""You're on point, Phife"" brings ""All the time, Tip,"" then you're in the right place. If your idea of hip-hop is confined to Snoop Dawg, NWA or Public Enemy, then you'll also benefit from spending a little time with Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi White, aka A Tribe Called Quest. In ""Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest,"" actor Michael Rapaport tries out his directorial chops by attempting to document the rise, fall, rise (again) and fall (again) of the seminal New York hip-hop group, achieving mixed results. Although the film is chock-a-block with great music and interesting characters, it lacks a coherent focus and seems to want to be all films to all people. A mixture of footage shot for this film and that from other sources, the documentary jumps back and forth between the band's early days, their first split in 1998 and their reunion (and subsequent second break-up) in 2008 on the Rock the Bells tour. It gives a reasonably detailed and personal look into what made the band tick as well as what made them stop. Unfortunately, it doesn't work as a whole. Great documentaries most often latch on to the universality of their subject and connect on an emotional or intellectual level with their audience. They can be about an obscure, unattractive animal (naked mole rats, anyone?), a troubled child in a small town (""Billy the Kid"") or a wacky modern-day philosopher king/tour guide (""The Cruise""), but they have a purpose, a point of view and a connection with the audience. ""Beats, Rhymes & Life,"" while loaded with great material, lacks that connection. Clearly charismatic and talented men, the four members of Tribe (White left the group for a significant stretch during its heyday but rejoined them for occasional reunion tours) have a lot to say about how they met, how they worked together and how they broke up, but the film never really pieces this together in any sort of narrative that can be closely followed. Phife Dawg's health problems (he is a type-1 diabetic who undergoes a kidney transplant during the film) are mentioned, but only White, ironically the least-involved member of the group, shows any real emotions about his friend's dire health condition. In the film's only other real showing of emotion, we learn that Phife Dawg's wife is a match, and she donates one of her kidneys. For New Yorkers or hip-hop fans (of which this critic is both), the film offers frequent bits of interest, humor and musical delight and is certainly a pleasant way to spend 98 minutes. Phife Dawg is especially loquacious, waxing rhapsodic on subjects as diverse as his eating habits (he lists Lorna Doones as one of the snack foods he's had to give up) and basketball. In the latter, he's seen wearing an LA Lakers uniform, and Q-Tip questions him about his allegiance to his hometown New York Knicks and their new star, Amar'e Stoudemire. Phife replies, rapid-fire, without missing a beat, that he loves the Knicks, but their front office is a mess and ""I like Amar'e Stoudemire, but I'm gonna need him to play some defense."" However, while the members of Tribe are all talented and charismatic artists with interesting and compelling stories to tell, ""Beats, Rhymes & Life"" doesn't tell them fully. It's a complex story involving music, family, history and the greater world of New York hip-hop (which is in and of itself worth of a film), and what it comes down to is that Rapaport had so many directions to choose, so much footage to watch, that the film suffers from the overload. Perhaps choosing a subject that is a little less close to his heart will afford Rapaport the distance that is sometimes needed to make a compelling documentary.","For hip-hop fans, the film offers frequent bits of interest, humor and musical delight .

"(CNN) -- Yaya Toure believes that Manchester City can become like his all-conquering former club Barcelona, the midfielder told CNN. After being criticized for defensive play last season, City boss Roberto Mancini has taken the English Premier League by storm with an all-out attacking style. Ivory Coast international Toure, who moved to Eastlands from the Camp Nou in a $38 million deal in July 2010, said that with the current wealth of expensive talent City can rival the European and Spanish champions' free-flowing passing style. The arrival of Sergio Aguero and Samir Nasri has meant City have not missed wantaway former captain Carlos Tevez, while David Silva has blossomed along with Edin Dzeko and Mario Balotelli for the 2011 FA Cup winners. ""Last year was difficult, because some of the media criticized City for defending more than attack,"" Toure said. ""(Now) the boss plays with a different system ... Sami Nasri, Edin Dzeko is playing fantastic now, Aguero, Silva is unbelievable."" Toure scored the goal that ended City's 35-year wait for a trophy at Wembley in May, and he said that if Mancini's men can maintain the form that has taken them top of the English table then they can be a serious threat to Barca's dominance. ""For me it's important that you have to first win something, and last year we did it. But this year, I think if we continue like that, if we win a couple more cups, maybe we can be like them, because Barcelona is this fantastic machine of football,"" the 28-year-old said. ""I'm full of confidence this year, I think this year is going to be amazing for us."" City qualified for the Europe's top club competition for the first time since 1969, and have a great chance of progressing into the knockout stage of the Champions League despite being drawn in a so-called ""Group of Death"" along with Bayern Munich, Napoli and Villarreal. ""I think you have to go step by step because for me, for the moment, the Premier League is the most important league,"" Toure said. ""But we focus on the Champions League. ""The Champions League is one of the best competitions in the world, so many great teams there. I think if we get some luck, we can go far."" Toure will miss a vital chunk of City's season when he heads to Gabon and Equatorial Guinea in January for the month-long African Cup of Nations. The Ivory Coast's ""Elephants,"" drawn in Group B with Burkina Faso, Sudan and Angola, are among the favorites to win the tournament for the first time since 1992, with several of the usual big-name countries not qualifying. Toure's home country is recovering from the civil war that broke out in March after former president Laurent Gbagbo refused to stand down despite losing the November 2010 elections, plus floods that hit Abidjan in June. ""Everybody in my country they are waiting for this cup. And, I think we can only give them the happiness if we win this cup, because the guys from there they need it a lot."" While Manchester United's status as one of the world's most popular clubs remains intact, Toure's presence at City along with his older brother Kolo has helped change the balance among supporters back home. ""Now I see the fans are very proud to put on the blue shirt of the club,"" he said. ""And now I think the image of City is starting to change. I hope God helps us to continue to win something, which will make a lot of people happy.""","Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure says the club can potentially rival Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- University of Missouri head football coach Gary Pinkel has been suspended for a week and docked another week's pay after his arrest on a drunken-driving charge, the university's athletics director announced Thursday. Pinkel, 59, was released on $500 bail after his arrest in Columbia, about 120 miles west of St. Louis, according to Boone County sheriff's department records. His unpaid suspension took effect Thursday afternoon, Athletics Director Mike Alden told reporters. And when Pinkel comes back, he will have to donate his next weekly salary to the school's Wellness Resource Center, which presents alcohol-awareness programs to students. He will also have to issue a public letter of apology; perform 50 hours of community service; forfeit any bonus if the Tigers make it into a bowl game; and see his salary frozen for a year. ""He's a tremendous guy, and he's got great character and he was unbelievably remorseful, as I would expect him to be,"" Alden said. But Pinkel's actions were ""certainly not consistent"" with values of the institution. ""This absolutely goes against everything that we stand for and everything he teaches his players in regards to our social responsibilities,"" he said. In a statement issued Thursday morning, Pinkel said he was stopped by a deputy after having dinner with friends and was ""very disappointed in myself for my lack of judgment."" ""Nobody should drink and drive, including me,"" he said. ""My staff and I constantly reinforce with each of our players the importance of not putting yourself into a position such as this. I did not follow that here, and for that, I sincerely apologize to the University of Missouri, to our administration, to the Board of Curators and to our fans.""

"(CNN) -- A federal judge in New Orleans has ruled that Halliburton is not liable for the some of the compensatory damages sought by third parties in the worst oil spill in U.S. history, leaving BP responsible for the majority of those claims. ""BP is required to indemnify Halliburton for third-party compensatory claims that arise from pollution or contamination that did not originate from the property or equipment of Halliburton located above the surface of the land or water, even if Halliburton's gross negligence caused the pollution,"" the order states. The judgment is similar to the decision that came down last week regarding Deepwater Horizon rig owner Transocean's responsibility in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster. In the ruling Tuesday, Judge Carl Barbier notes the similar contractual indemnity issues between Transocean and Halliburton, and accordingly left it open as to whether Halliburton would also be held liable for punitive damages or civil penalties under the Clean Water Act. Halliburton was contracted by BP to cement the Macondo well that was the source of the oil spill, and had argued its contract protected the energy company from legal action resulting from its work. ""Halliburton agrees with the ruling to the extent that it requires BP to honor its contractual indemnity obligations,"" said Beverly Stafford, Halliburton's director of corporate affairs. Earlier this month, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists said they had confirmed through chemical testing just how much oil was released in the disaster, which begain with the April 20, 2010, rig explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon that claimed 11 lives, and continued for nearly three months afterward. NOAA said approximately 59,200 barrels of liquid oil per day flowed out into the Gulf, and that the ""leaking gas and oil quickly separated"" into three different areas: as an underwater plume of droplets, an airborne plume of evaporating chemicals, and the slick of oil visible on the Gulf's surface. BP said Tuesday that Halliburton still needs to be held accountable. ""Today's ruling, together with last week's decision on Transocean's financial obligations stemming from its conduct at the Macondo well, is a strong signal that contractors involved in critical well operations will be held accountable for their actions under the law,"" a BP statement said. ""All official investigations have concluded that Halliburton played a causal role in the accident, and following this ruling, Halliburton is, at a minimum, responsible for any punitive damages as well as civil penalties to the extent that they may apply under the Clean Water Act. Moreover, the court determined that if Halliburton is found to have committed fraud, then the indemnity could be void,"" BP said. Last September, the government issued a formal report on the oil spill, finding that BP, Transocean and Halliburton all shared responsibility for the explosion, but that BP was ""ultimately responsible"" for operations at the site ""in a way that ensured the safety and protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the environment."" The British oil giant said it has already paid billions in damages and that the other culpable parties are still on the hook. ""BP has acknowledged its role in the accident and has paid more than $7.8 billion in claims, advances and other payments to individuals, businesses and governments, regardless of whether third parties ultimately would be responsible for any of that sum or additional liabilities. Our charges and provisions never assumed any recovery from Transocean or Halliburton for pollution-related damages. These two decisions should put an end to the attempts by Transocean and Halliburton to avoid their obligations.""

"Washington (CNN) -- We all know about the power of born-again and evangelical voters in the Iowa Republican presidential caucuses. Four years ago, three out of every five Iowans who attended a GOP precinct caucus described themselves that way, and they handed Baptist minister and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee an upset victory over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum would like to repeat that trick again on Tuesday. Whether 60% of the 2012 Iowa GOP caucus vote will be made up of self-described born-again or evangelical voters again, and whether any one of those candidates will be able to scoop up almost half of them as as Huckabee did, remains to be seen. But even if Bachmann, Perry or Santorum can repeat Huckabee's feat, then what? New Hampshire's Yankee Republicans have been notoriously skeptical of what they perceive as holy rollers roaring out of Iowa. Huckabee could only manage a distant third-place finish with 11% of the vote in the 2008 Granite State primary. And when the 1988 Iowa caucuses elevated televangelist Pat Robertson with a second-place finish that year, he could only manage a fifth-place showing and 9% of the vote in the New Hampshire GOP primary. Both Huckabee and Robertson quickly headed to South Carolina to try to resuscitate their campaigns in its primary, but there were no revivals: Huckabee finished second there, and Robertson third. CNN surveyed 64 Iowa GOP insiders, including state legislators, local elected and party officials, veterans of previous caucus campaigns, and other party operatives, and asked them if a relatively strong showing by any of this year's more conservative trio could lead to a legitimate run for the GOP nomination by rallying the faith vote. And in the state that knows that vote well, there were doubters. If Bachmann, Perry or Santorum is able to finish in the top three in the caucuses, do you think that candidate will be able to consolidate the born-again/evangelical vote and become a significant factor in the GOP nominating contest? â€¢ Yes: 46% . â€¢ No: 54% . The Iowa GOP insiders' skepticism was informed in part at least by what happened four years ago. ""Huckabee couldn't do it and he was a much better candidate,"" observed one Iowa GOP insider. Maybe Santorum or Bachmann or Perry could consolidate the religious vote for a while, allowed another GOP insider: ""Be a significant factor in the GOP nominating contest? No, the Huckabee campaign confirmed this in 2008."" RELATED: Two out of three think Romney will win . RELATED: Some Iowa Republicans want more options . And even several of those yeses were qualified. ""Bachmann and Perry are finished, they just don't know it yet,"" said one Iowa GOP insider dismissively. ""Santorum could ride the wave for a while, but I doubt to the nomination."" Another echoed, ""Santorum could become the anti-Mitt, but (the) lack of a national organization and fundraising will be an impediment. He'd need to suddenly catch fire in South Carolina and he'll have a tough time with resources in Florida."" The CNN Iowa GOP insiders were surveyed from the evening of December 27 through the morning of December 30. Most of the survey was conducted over the Internet; some interviews were conducted by phone. The Iowa insiders were given anonymity for their individual answers in order to encourage candid responses. And while some insiders were aligned with one or another of the presidential campaigns, more than two-thirds said they had not endorsed and were not working for any candidate in the race.

"(CNN) -- President Benigno Aquino of the Philippines declared a state of national calamity on Tuesday after visiting areas in the south of the country that were devastated by a tropical storm over the weekend. The death toll continued to rise from Tropical Storm Washi, which has left tens of thousands of people homeless as aid agencies struggle to deal with a growing humanitarian crisis. Aquino made the declaration in a speech broadcast on national radio after surveying the destruction in the port cities Iligan and Cagayan de Oro on the island of Mindanao, where the vast majority of the dead were found. Figures released by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council put the death toll at 957 early Tuesday. The Philippine Red Cross reported a lower death toll, at 713. Survivors in the area recounted brushes with death as flooding from the storm struck in the middle of the night. Now, they're trying to piece their lives back together. ""We escaped just in time,"" said Rona Magto, a high school teacher and mother of two from Iligan City. ""Those behind us were already flooded and cars were afloat. There was water everywhere and the current was so strong."" Rona and her family survived, but others, including her best friend, Remy Rubio, are missing. Rona has since returned home and started to clean up in an effort to make her home habitable again. But outside her window, she says, she sees emptiness. The area in front of her still looks like a river and behind her, posts are left where there used to be houses. Tropical Storm Washi has affected more than 338,415 people, the disaster council said. About 88,000 people are being served at evacuation centers, according to the Department of Social Welfare and Development. U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement Monday expressing ""deep condolences for the tremendous loss of life and devastation."" He said the United States ""stands ready to assist the Philippine people and government should humanitarian assistance and recovery efforts be needed."" The Red Cross said hundreds of people remained unaccounted for after entire villages were swept away. The government has actually lost count of the number of people missing, said Benito Ramos, head of the disaster council. At least 400 people are missing in Iligan City alone, according to the Department of Interior and Local Government. Military and disaster officials said many people were swept away as they were sleeping. Water-logged bodies from washed-away villages floated at the shoreline on the northwestern coast of Mindanao island. Five people were killed in a landslide, but virtually all the others died in flash flooding after Tropical Storm Washi, which is called Sendong locally. Survivors in the hardest-hit areas are contending with no electricity or clean drinking water. Flash flooding overnight Friday, following 10 hours of rain, fueled the devastation. As much as 20 centimeters (8 inches) of rain fell within 24 hours in some areas. December generally brings about 60 millimeters of rain (a little over 2 inches) to the region, CNN Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri reported. Journalist Sunshine de Leon contributed to this report.","NEW: The death toll from Tropical Storm Washi rises to 957, government says .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Some Israeli archaeologists are having a particularly happy Hanukkah, thanks in part to a British volunteer who took time off from her job to work on a dig. Archaeologists found a hoard of gold coins from the 7th century in Jerusalem on Sunday. The Israel Antiquities Authority reported a thrilling find Sunday -- the discovery of 264 ancient gold coins in Jerusalem National Park. The coins were minted during the early 7th century. ""This is one of the largest and most impressive coin hoards ever discovered in Jerusalem -- certainly the largest and most important of its period,"" said Doron Ben-Ami and Yana Tchekhanovets, who are directing the excavation on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. Researchers discovered the coins at the beginning of the eight-day Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which started at sunset on Sunday. One of the customs of the holiday is to give ""gelt,"" or coins, to children, and the archaeologists are referring to the find as ""Hanukkah money."" Nadine Ross, a British archaeological volunteer, happened onto the coins during the dig just below the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. ""To be honest, I just thought, 'Thank God I didn't throw it in the rubbish bucket,' "" said Ross, who had taken four weeks off from her engineering job in England to work at the site. ""I was just glad I sort of spotted it before I disturbed it too much."" The 1,400-year-old coins were found in the Giv'ati car park in the City of David in the walls around Jerusalem National Park, a site that has yielded other finds, including a well-preserved gold earring with pearls and precious stones. They were in a collapsed building that dates back to the 7th century, the end of the Byzantine period.  The coins bear a likeness of Heraclius, who was the Byzantine emperor from 610 to 641. The authority said that while different coins had been minted during this emperor's reign, the coins found at the site represent ""one well-known type."" In that style, the emperor is clad with military garb and is holding a cross in his right hand. On the other side is the sign of the cross. Authorities said the excavation of the building where the hoard was discovered is in its early stages. They are attempting to learn about the building and its owner and the circumstances of its destruction. ""Since no pottery vessel was discovered adjacent to the hoard, we can assume that it was concealed inside a hidden niche in one of the walls of the building. It seems that with its collapse, the coins piled up there among the building debris,"" Ben-Ami and Tchekhanovets said. The find is a a golden moment for Ross, who said ""it is a pity that I can't take it home with me. But there you go."" CNN's Shira Medding and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","NEW: Coins were found by British volunteer; ""Pity that I can't take it home,"" she says .

"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- Strikes by trade unions in Belgium disrupted travel Monday on the Eurostar and Thalys international train lines, the companies announced, as European leaders gathered in the capital Brussels for an informal summit. Eurostar passengers trying to get to Brussels from London had to change from trains to buses in Lille, France, on Sunday night and Monday, the company announced. Eurostar ""strongly advised"" passengers to rebook travel for another day. Thalys cancelled dozens of train services to and from major European destinations including Paris and Amsterdam because of the Belgian strike. But CNN journalists in Brussels Monday did not see protests Monday morning or notice major traffic disruptions as a result of the strike. One of Belgium's main unions, known as FGTB in French and ABVV in Flemish, said the strike was necessary because negotiations with the government were going slowly and not producing specific results. The general strike was necessary, the union said January 17, ""to convince the government and employers to keep in mind the social reality of employees and social welfare recipients.""

"(CNN) -- The 2015 British Open will take place at St Andrews it was confirmed Tuesday, with golf's oldest major returning to the Scottish course for the 29th time. The venue, known as 'The Home of Golf', last held the tournament in 2010, with South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen claiming a seven-shot victory for his first major triumph. The 2015 tournament will be the 144th edition of the championship and will take place from July 16-19. ""We are delighted to announce that The Open will be returning to St Andrews and the historic Old Course in 2015,"" Royal and Ancient chief executive Peter Dawson told the European Tour's official website. ""St Andrews has proved time and again that it is perfectly equipped to host The Open and I am certain we will yet again see a worthy winner lift the Claret Jug. ""Players, spectators and officials alike will welcome a return to the game's spiritual home and I fully expect that we will witness another thrilling championship."" Some of the sport's biggest names have lifted the famous Claret Jug trophy at St Andrews, with 14-time major winner Tiger Woods having won at the Fife course in both 2000 and 2005. Bobby Jones, the American winner of 13 majors including three British Opens, won at the Old Course in 1927, while more recently the late Seve Ballesteros clinched victory at the venue in 1984.

"(Rolling Stone) -- As expected, the four original members of Black Sabbath -- Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward -- announced recently they will reunite and tour in 2012, including a headlining set at the Download Festival in June. The surprise news was that the reunion will include a new album, produced by Rick Rubin, due next fall. Host Henry Rollins, who introduced himself at the famed Whisky A Go Go on the Sunset Strip as the ""press liaison,"" talked about the impact of the band, both generally and in his own life. ""I was a very alienated young person,"" Rollins said, ""and when I heard Black Sabbath I realized my life had a soundtrack. I realized there were people out there using music to make great statements. When I heard 'Iron Man,' high school became powerless over me. This is true outsider music."" Then Rollins brought Rubin and the four Sabbath bandmates to the Whisky stage, where they'd played 41 years earlier to the day. Rollins hosted a Q&A before the band answered questions from the assembled press corps. ""Why now?"" Rollins began. Osbourne summed it up: ""It's just time,"" he said. Those sentiments were echoed by Iommi, who said, ""It's now or never. We get along great. Everything's really good."" The band also credited Rubin's persistence for helping get them back in the studio. ""He phoned us every five minutes,"" Iommi joked. ""I've known Rick for many years,"" Osbourne added. ""He wanted to do it a long time ago."" With the album and tour not due until next fall, it's clearly early in the process. But the quartet has begun rehearsing. Rubin said it sounds like the four guys in Black Sabbath getting together and playing, and Butler agreed. ""It's really back to the old Sabbath style and sound,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Thirty-nine years ago, Roe v. Wade was decided. With the passage of nearly four decades, the landscape of abortion has changed in a way that should trouble even those who consider themselves pro-choice. Right now, 10 states and the District of Columbia have no statutory time limit on when abortions can be performed, while five more states allow abortion up to the end of the second trimester (about 27 or 28 weeks). Yet, we know that by 28 weeks, the great majority of fetuses would survive birth. In other words, we allow the killing of viable infants in our country. This is a fact that progressives (including me) would rather not address. As two Maryland abortion doctors face murder charges for allegedly performing late-term abortions, the issue now has a pair of human faces. Drs. Steven Brigham and Nicola Riley were arrested after the discovery of what are alleged to be several viable fetuses in a freezer chest. The story only got stranger on New Year's Day, when a clinic apparently owned by Brigham burned to the ground in Florida. Important facts are still unknown, and the doctors have asserted their innocence regarding any late-term abortions. There has been relatively little discussion of this case in progressive circles. It's no wonder that we would rather look away. The abortion debate has largely devolved into professional activists screaming at each other on television and at street protests. We don't want to be like those people. We are also haunted by the ragged remains of the Supreme Court opinion in Roe v. Wade. Despite being disavowed by subsequent opinions and some of the individual justices, one part of that precedent lives on in the statutes of some states and the practices of several doctors: The assertion in Roe's majority opinion that ""viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks)."" The scientific claim that viability (the ability of a fetus to live outside the womb) ""usually"" occurs at 28 weeks has been undermined by medical advances over the past 38 years. Children who would have died if born late in the second trimester in 1973 would more than likely live if they were born now. A Swedish study in 2009 found that preterm babies born late in the second trimester who are given intensive care survive at surprising rates: 53% of those born at 23 weeks live, 67% at 24 weeks, and by 25 weeks, 82% of the babies survive. (Sweden's health care system makes it possible to reliably track survival rates, but the type of care provided there is similar to that available in the United States). In the same way that the law had to change to accommodate advances in DNA evidence that can exonerate those on death row, state laws must change to accommodate that with modern medical care, a child born at 27 weeks is very likely not only going to live, but live a fairly normal life. We progressives tend to revere science, and there are few scientific proofs more convincing than those former preterm infants who live and thrive all around us. Though late-term abortions are only a small fraction of the total number of terminated pregnancies, it remains a defining issue for our society. As someone who works against the death penalty, trying to save the lives of people who have committed murder, I have a moral obligation to set my feet, breathe in deeply and honestly admit that prosecutors are morally in the right to pursue cases where they believe viable fetuses are being aborted in violation of the law. A life is ended, and that is murder, if the facts so prove. Some will see any accommodation on abortion as ""appeasement"" of conservatives, but this attitude is nothing less than the adoption of hard-line evidence-ignoring tactics that progressives so often (and properly) decry in groups such as the National Rifle Association. We may disagree about whether life begins at conception, but it is now irrefutable that life is viable at 27 weeks. To deny this plainly observable fact is akin to denying the existence of evolution or global warming. Much as Troy Davis (who was executed in Georgia last year despite troubling exculpatory evidence) and Hank Skinner (who received a stay of his execution in Texas to allow DNA testing to be pursued) personified the problems with the death penalty, there are those who do so just as starkly when we ponder late-term abortion. For me, that person is named Rees. On a hot summer day in Waco, Texas, his proud grandfather carried him across the street for me to meet, months after his birth at about 24 weeks. His eyes were clear in the Texas sun, he was wrapped in a blue-and-white blanket, and he was surrounded by love. He was, and is, a person, and that matters as much as Troy Davis and Hank Skinner.

"United Nations (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council this week will take up a draft resolution proposed by Morocco that calls on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down and transfer power. ""It is primarily a straightforward condemnation of what has transpired, a call upon the government of Syria to adhere to the commitments it made,"" U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice told reporters about the draft. She noted that it contains no sanctions nor does it threaten the use of force. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the draft demands the government end the violence, pull back its heavy weaponry from residential areas, allow monitors to operate freely, release political prisoners and allow the news media to operate. ""This is a regime composed of a small minority that is now attacking the majority of Syrians,"" she said. ""It is the regime that bears responsibility for the violence."" Nuland said U.S. officials have also seen reports ""of Iran playing a nefarious role inside Syria."" But, she added, ""we are not in a position to confirm the accuracy"" of those reports. The proposal comes after the Arab League suspended a mission to monitor whether al-Assad was abiding by an agreement to end the crackdown, which has left thousands of civilians dead. Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby is scheduled Tuesday to deliver the monitoring mission's findings to the Security Council. He and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani will also address reporters. ""A swift reaction by the U.N. Security Council is urgently needed,"" said Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council. ""I urge all members of the U.N. Security Council to assume their responsibilities in relation to the situation in Syria, and adopt steps long overdue in order to bring an end to the repression in Syria."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday called for the council to ""send a clear message of support to the Syrian people: We stand with you."" ""The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the escalation of the Syrian regime's violent and brutal attacks on its own people,"" Clinton said in a statement. ""The longer the Assad regime continues its attacks on the Syrian people and stands in the way of a peaceful transition, the greater the concern that instability will escalate and spill over throughout the region."" French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe will travel to U.N. headquarters in New York on Tuesday ""in order to persuade the Security Council to fully assume its responsibilities in the face of the increased level of crimes against humanity being perpetrated by the Syrian regime,"" according to a statement on France's U.N. delegation's website. ""Everything must be done to bring an end to the spiral of violence now resulting from the bloody crackdown that Bashar al-Assad's regime has been imposing for more than 10 months,"" the statement continues, urging other nations to support the Moroccan resolution. ""It's time for the Security Council to be able to take action in order to help resolve this crisis."" The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), citing an official source at the Foreign and Expatriates Ministry, reported Tuesday that ""the U.S.-Western hostile statements"" are being espoused to ""target Syria and create a different image about the ... Syrian crisis."" ""We won't be astonished at the absence of wisdom and reasonability of those statements,"" said the source, who was not identified. ""We regret that those statements are still coming from countries accustomed to making the Middle East a field for their foolishness and failing experiments."" Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia had proposed its own draft resolution calling for the end to violence by all sides, the rejection of foreign interference in Syria and the start of an international dialogue without conditions, SANA said Monday, citing Japanese NHK Television. ""We are convinced that the Moscow contacts are indispensable in order to immediately cease any violence in Syria, prevent bloodshed and confrontation in the society, and ensure the success of deep democratic transformations in the country in compliance with the aspirations of all Syrians,"" the ministry said, according to the state-run Itar-Tass News Agency. Russia said Syrian authorities have agreed to informal talks with opposition representatives in Moscow. ""We are expecting that the opposition will also give their assent in the next days and put the interests of the Syrian people before any other ideas,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. SANA carried two reports quoting Russian officials rejecting foreign interference. One cited a Russian official as complaining that ""the opposition and those supporting it in the west and Arab world"" are refusing to engage in dialogue. One of the Syrian reports also cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov as calling on the Security Council ""to study in detail the report of the Arab League Observer Mission on Syria"" before discussing the draft resolution the Arab League has presented to the Security Council. Morocco's draft resolution calls for al-Assad to step down and supports ""full implementation"" of the Arab League recommendations on Syria. That would include calling on Syria to form a unity government within two months. Monday's developments came amid continued heavy fighting between Syrian forces and the rebel Free Syrian Army in suburbs of the capital city of Damascus, where Syrian forces have been battling to take back neighborhoods in Saqba and Maleiha, according to opposition groups. One hundred people were killed Monday, according to the Local Coordination Committees, an opposition group that organizes and documents demonstrations. The deaths include eight children and a woman, the group said. Seventy-six of the deaths were in Homs, 15 in Daraa, six were in the Damascus countryside, two were in Idlib and one in Hasakah, the group said. A resident of Homs said six members of a family -- parents, two boys and two girls -- were found killed Monday in the city's Karm Al-Zayton neighborhood. A YouTube video showed what appeared to be marks of torture on the bodies. A resident, citing witnesses, told CNN that victims were killed by forces loyal to al-Assad. CNN could not confirm this independently. ""Look at this boy, he was found holding on to his mother,"" said a voice on the video. ""Some of his mother's hair is still in his hand! ... look at the hair. His mother's hair is still in his hand."" The woman's eye had been gouged from its socket. ""This is the work of Assad's gangs and his so-called reforms,"" the voice said. Government forces stormed the town of Rankous, and an explosion shook the town, according to the opposition activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Two defectors from the military were killed, dozens of civilians wounded, and some houses were destroyed in the bombardment, the London-based group said. In Idlib, clashes were under way Monday afternoon between military forces and a group of defectors, the observatory said. The group also reported violence in Rastan, Daraa, and other towns and cities across Syria. In Aleppo, lawyers conducted a sit-in at a courthouse, objecting to the killings of Syrians by security members and calling for the release of detainees, the Local Coordination Committees said. In part of Homs, Syrian forces battled to take back a neighborhood from the rebel army and anti-government protesters, according to an opposition activist who asked that his identity be withheld for fear of government reprisal. Casualties littered the streets of the neighborhood, which was under siege, the activist said. On state media, Syria routinely blames violence in the country on ""armed terrorist groups."" Citing Syria's Interior Ministry, a SANA report claimed that ""competent authorities killed big numbers of terrorists and caught many others"" over the past three days. ""The authorities are chasing the terrorists who remain at large,"" the report adds. A similar statement, also attributed to the Interior Ministry, read Monday by a host on state television said security forces had ""conducted operations"" over the prior three days in several cities, pursuing members of the ""armed terrorist groups that committed the most horrific crimes of killing and kidnapping, and planted landmines and detonated them on streets."" The groups had ""the most advanced weapons, including Israeli and American made weapons,"" and Syrian troops were able to kill many of the terrorists and arrest others, the statement said, adding that the pursuit for others was under way. SANA reported that ""six army members, including a colonel, were martyred on Monday by the gunfire of an armed terrorist group while they were in the line of duty"" in Daraa. When the group attacked a car carrying military personnel, ""a clash occurred, resulting in the killing and the injury of a number of the terrorists,"" the agency said. Another 22 members of the army and law enforcement were taken from hospitals in Tishrin and Homs and buried Monday, SANA reported. ""The martyrs were killed at the hands of the armed terrorist groups while performing their national duty in Damascus countryside, Homs and Idlib."" SANA also reported that an ""armed terrorist group"" blew up a gas pipeline. No casualties were reported. In addition, SANA said, another group killed a doctor at Bissan Hospital in Homs. CNN cannot independently confirm opposition or government reports of those killed or wounded because access to the country is limited. Syria has seen a sharp increase in violence in recent weeks, with hundreds killed in clashes between government forces, rebels and anti-government protesters. That escalation led the Arab League to suspend its mission Saturday. Ali Erfan, senior adviser to the Arab League's secretary-general, said observers outside Damascus would be redeployed to the capital. Some will leave the country, while others will remain without conducting missions, he said, adding that he did not know how many would remain. The violence in Syria erupted in Daraa last March, after a number of teenagers and children were arrested for writing political graffiti that opposed the government. The unrest spread into an uprising, part of the ""Arab Spring"" taking place in several countries across the the Middle East and North Africa. The United Nations estimated last month that more than 5,000 people have died since March. Opposition groups estimate a higher death toll, with counts near or exceeding 7,000 people. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Arwa Damon, Josh Levs, Yousuf Basil, Joe Sterling, and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","NEW: France's foreign minister will try to persuade the U.N.

"(CNN) -- Of the fall television season, it's probably safe to say, NBC's ""Grimm"" was not expected to be the breakout hit, or any hit for that matter. The time slot was terrible (Friday nights), it had no major stars attached to it and the premise -- Grimm fairy tales set in modern times around the banner of a police procedural -- sounds like it could be the cheesiest thing ever. But it's not. The show is dark and imaginative, both in rich, lush set designs and writing that puts a spin on the original Grimm tales where they come alive and make sense in the context viewers are given (short answer: the Brothers Grimm weren't writing early kid-lit; they were writing about real occurrences). ""Grimm"" centers around Detective Nick Burkhardt (played by David Giuntoli), who in the first episode finds out he's a long lost descendent of the Grimms and is starting to see people for who they really are -- in short, evil. Giuntoli has been a working actor for the past several years, picking up mostly one-off roles on shows like ""Grey's Anatomy,"" ""Cold Case"" and ""Hot in Cleveland"" before landing the plum role on ""Grimm."" CNN recently spoke with the actor from the ""Grimm"" set in Portland, Oregon, about what makes the show such an unlikely hit and the process of bringing fairy tales to the small screen. CNN: Prior to ""Grimm,"" what were you doing for the most part? Giuntoli: I was a working actor for three or four years before I got ""Grimm."" I was doing what many actors do in Hollywood: I was working gig to gig. I would book a lot of pilots for TV shows that weren't picked up. I'd been positioning myself for the last years to get the show, but it takes so many ... just the right mix of circumstances to take place for a show to go. But the first two years I lived in L.A., I managed an apartment complex in Little Armenia. So I didn't have to pay rent. There were more Armenians in Little Armenia than I think in actual Armenia. CNN: What's a ""Grimm"" audition like? Do you have to pretend like wolf people are chasing you? Giuntoli: It's funny how the audition process is. So often you'll get a script that's completely retooled by the time you get to the series. And that's what happened. I was auditioning with scenes that never made it to the final script. For example, in one of my first scenes I auditioned was me telling (my girlfriend) Juliette everything I'd been seeing and admitting everything to her, right away. Now, we probably won't let that happen for a long time. But I didn't have to chase anybody. CNN: The show's part police procedural, part fantasy. Why does this mix work? Giuntoli:  It caters to several demographics out there. Something that surprised me: Young people really are enjoying this. The ""Twilight"" crowd are going crazy for it. And it makes sense. They're home on Friday nights. Families are watching this together. That really helped it become this little ratings hit for NBC. People love it. Hopefully the procedural people like it, too. Let the Venn diagram overlap everybody. CNN: You could be the next Robert Patterson. Giuntoli: If I stop eating, grow and lose that pesky pigment in my skin. CNN: But what do you think it is? That viewers had gotten bored of the run-of-the-mill cop dramas, or that fantasy is just so appealing right now. Giuntoli: [Attracting the ""Twilight"" fans] is something we didn't consider would happen; it's only dawning on us now that it's happening. The people that are visiting our sets, the people that are really going crazy are 25 and younger. Maybe that's who goes crazy for anything, but that's what we're seeing. Another thing that's been postulated is the economic downturn and that people flock to fantasy for escapism. I don't know how true that is, I don't know if that's any more true now than it ever was, or people are watching TV now because it's network and it's free. But it makes sense to me. CNN: What's the ""Grimm"" set like? Giuntoli: We're not serious at all. We are somewhere between good times and grab-a**. I don't know what that really means ... no, the cast, we all hit it off. We're all actors and we think we're funny. We do about half our work outside. I was just in a rainforest, I swear, two hours ago. You make one turn down a windy road and it's sunny, and the next turn you're in a cloud and there's ferns all over the place like Jurassic Park. We try to use the aesthetic of the woods and the moss and the light precipitation. That's where ""Grimm"" lives aesthetically. That mossy, dense forest, which is a great substitute for the Black Forest, which is where the originals were largely set. CNN: At the table readings, or when you get on set -- have you noticed any difficulties in adapting these old narratives into modern times? Giuntoli: No, I haven't. Our writing staff is really clever and fairly seamlessly adapt the old fairy tales. Also, they take liberties. They pluck what they want from the original Grimm fairy tales and discard what they don't want, in a sense. It's TV, it's creative, they can do whatever they want.

"(CNN) -- The Philippine military said it killed a man who is on the FBI most-wanted terror list and two other senior militants Thursday in a predawn airstrike on a remote southern island. About 15 militants died in the early morning airstrike on the island province of Sulu, part of the autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao, according to a spokesman for the Philippines armed forces. The dead included two senior figures in Jemaah Islamiyah and members of the militant group Abu Sayyaf, said Col. Arnulfo Marcelo Burgos, the spokesman. U.S. officials had a $5 million reward for the capture of Jemaah Islamiyah leader Zulkifli bin Abdul Hir, according to the FBI website. The Malaysian, also known as Marwan, was on the FBI most-wanted list for ""providing material support to terrorists, conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists"" and contributing ""goods and services"" to a global terror network. Another Jemaah Islamiyah member Mohammad Ali, also known as Muawiyah, and Abu Sayyaf leader Gumbahali Jumdail were also among those killed, according to the spokesman. The airstrike was a joint effort between the army, air force, the navy and the police, and was ""very brief but precise,"" Burgos said. The Philippine police are at the scene helping identify the bodies, Burgos said, but added that DNA tests had been conducted. In the past, Philippine officials made premature announcements about the capture and deaths of Indonesian fugitives Dulmatin, who turned up in Indonesia in 2010, and Umar Patek, who was captured in Pakistan last year. Both had fled to the southern Philippines and were reported captured or killed in Mindanao. The Mindanao group of islands includes a Muslim autonomous region set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the Philippines, a predominantly Christian country. The Jemaah Islamiyah terror group first came to international attention when the Bali bombings of October 2002 provided a stark warning of the group's abilities and its deadly ambitions. Active across much of Southeast Asia, it has close ties with Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network.","U.S. officials had a $5 million bounty for a Jemaah Islamiyah leader killed in the airstrike .

"London, England (CNN) -- Estelle: Back To Love . Estelle is one prime example of how UK talent is taking the world by storm. When I met her at the 2004 MOBO Awards, where she won the Best Newcomer award, I felt she was going to become an international sensation. Now a three-time MOBO award winner, she seems to get better and better each time she releases new material. She recently created a free mixtape called ""AOM: The Prequel,"" which could have easily been another record, but the song that I just love is ""Back To Love."" The track's message can come across a bit upsetting since it's about her ex-boyfriend moving on. But Estelle makes you think of the bigger picture and doesn't dwell on the past but looks to the future. It is the perfect message to convey. KOF: Be Like You . KOF is an artist who shows it's not just the artists from London who have a big future ahead of them. We rate the young man from Liverpool so highly that we made sure MOBO TV shot an acoustic session with him and one of the songs we were lucky enough to hear live was ""Be Like You."" The singer/songwriter's second single is getting huge support from the UK radio stations like 1Xtra and Choice FM, and rightly so. He is re-injecting true soul music back in the public eye and I can only support this as soul music is the first genre of music I fell in love with. It was one of the reasons why I started up the MOBO Awards in 1996. Apart from, of course, Adele, there are not enough musicians out there who can really touch your innerself like the greats, such as Aretha Franklin, could many years ago. Obviously, these artists are plying their trade in the UK, but KOF, however, is getting the recognition he deserves quicker than most. Mary J Blige: 25/8 . One of my favorite all-time artists Mary J Blige returned this year. I was so happy to see the release of her new album ""My Life II ... The Journey Continues Act 1"" as she seems to be back to her best. One of R&B's most important and critically-acclaimed artists, she has had many problems in her personal life, but with pain comes acceptance, then joy, and Mary is able to put them all behind her to create some of the best R&B songs to come out of America in the past 20 years. ""25/8"" is a track that meets all of the criteria of what Mary J Blige is all about. It's soul meets hip hop with her rough vocals complementing the track. It's safe to say nobody in the world could cover a Mary J Blige song and get the same raw and powerful emotion. A true great among us and like a fine wine, only gets better with age. Labrinth ft Tinie Tempah: Earthquake . Probably the nicest man in the music business, Labrinth has become a big name in the music business without even releasing records, but producing some of the UK scene's most successful tracks in the past couple of years. He was the mastermind behind Tinie Tempah's hits ""Pass Out,"" ""Frisky"" and ""Wonderman,"" as well as putting his mark on Ms Dynamite's comeback single ""Neva Soft"" and Yasmin's hit ""Finish Line."" After giving us a little taste of what Labrinth the artist is about last year with ""Let The Sunshine,"" the man from Hackney brought the year to a standstill with his new track ""Earthquake."" Featuring the amazing Tinie Tempah, the whole song from start to finish displays a new level of excitement and constantly surprises you since it works on so many levels. When the song goes to a standstill and you hear a dark version of the chorus before the beat kicks in is a stroke of genius that only Labrinth could come up with. Not to mention, the video is surreal! 2012 will be a big year for Labrinth. Kimbra: Settle Down . Kimbra is a surprise choice of mine as about a month ago, I didn't know she existed. But our new website editor brought her to my attention as he listens to a wide range of genres and played a song by Gotye in the office called ""Somebody I Used To Know,"" which features Kimbra. Apparently she experiments with jazz and soul music so I gave her a listen and now I can't get enough of her track ""Settle Down."" The young New Zealander reminds me of a young Nina Simone with a voice that doesn't suit her at all since it seems like her vocal chords have aged beyond her current time. I believe in finding new artists as you can't just live in the past when it comes to music. Music styles will change and it's important for us to keep up to date with the new sounds. I predict Kimbra is going to be around for a long time. The opinions in this piece are solely those of Kanya King.","Kanya King launched the Music of Black Origin awards in 1996 .

"(CNN) -- In March 2009, when I was detained in Evin Prison in Iran, two evangelical Christians were arrested. I never met them but spotted them a few times through the barred window of my cell as they walked back and forth to the bathroom down the hall. I would later learn that Maryam Rostampour and Marzieh Amirizadeh had converted from Islam to Christianity and faced charges of spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic, insulting religious sanctities, and committing apostasy. They resisted severe pressure to renounce their faith, and in November 2009, after an international outcry, the two women went free. News headlines are now highlighting the plight of another Iranian Christian accused of apostasy, or abandoning one's religion. When Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani was 19, he converted from Islam to Christianity. In 2010, a provincial court sentenced him to death. This year, Iran's Supreme Court ruled that the case should be reviewed and the sentence overturned if he recants his faith -- a step Nadarkhani, 34, has so far refused to take. Now, according to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, Iran's judiciary has ordered the verdict to be delayed, possibly for one year. But Nadarkhani's supporters hope sustained worldwide pressure will lead to his just and immediate release. As international criticism has mounted, an Iranian official has alleged that Nadarkhani is being prosecuted not for his faith but for crimes including rape and extortion. Nadarkhani's attorney, however, says the only charge the pastor has faced is apostasy, and court documents support this assertion. Although Iran's penal code does not include a specific provision for apostasy, judges are given a fairly wide degree of latitude to issue rulings based on their own interpretation of Islamic law. In the past this has led to punishments ranging from imprisonment to death. The last person officially executed in Iran for apostasy was Hossein Soodmand, a Pentecostal minister who converted from Islam before Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution and was hanged in 1990. Iranian officials often say their country's recognized religious minorities (Christians, Jews, and adherents of the ancient Persian religion of Zoroastrianism) enjoy freedoms equal to their Muslim counterparts. Iran's constitution gives these three religious minorities certain rights, such as five seats in the 290-member parliament and the freedom to perform their religious rituals. The constitution's articles, however, are all set within the boundaries of Islam, and Islamic codes grant superior legal status to male Muslims. Many non-Shiites in Iran have also complained of limits on education, work, and exercising their faith. Critics accuse the Islamic regime of having monitored, harassed, abducted, detained, tortured, and killed citizens based upon their religion. Since 1999, the U.S. State Department has designated Iran a ""country of particular concern"" because of religious repression. The State Department has focused on the treatment of Sufi and Sunni Muslims, Protestant evangelical Christians, Jews, Shiites who don't share the government's official views, and Baha'is, whose faith is not recognized by Iran's regime. Christian leaders in Iran have usually blunted their criticism of the regime, in part to avoid tensions. When I attended Christmas Eve Mass in Iran four years ago, I saw a few dozen worshipers, but I also heard that they had to get government permission to hold the service and were not allowed to proselytize. They had a Christian school, but it had to have a Muslim principal. They could print Christian texts but only with the authorities' approval. A number of Iranian Christians who recently left Iran have told me that since the country's 2009 disputed presidential election, pressure on their communities has intensified, prompting many more Christians to emigrate. In April, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom reported a rise in Iranian authorities raiding church services and harassing worshipers. Evangelicals and other Protestants have been particularly targeted. Unlike Iran's traditionally recognized Christian minorities, such as Armenians, Assyrians, and Chaldeans, evangelical churches hold their services in the Farsi language. Iranian authorities accuse them of spreading Christian writings in Farsi to convert Muslims. ""They are tough on us because we educate others,"" a former pastor of an underground evangelical church in Iran told me on condition of anonymity. ""They call it proselytizing, but we don't proselytize. We discuss the realities that Jesus Christ talks about in the Bible, and we never speak about the Islamic Republic."" Shortly after their release from prison, Maryam and Marzieh, the two Christian converts detained down the corridor from me, left Iran. If they stayed, they may have shared the tragic fate of the Rev. Mehdi Dibaj. Dibaj, a Christian convert from Islam, was jailed for a decade and released in 1994 after international appeals. Soon afterward, he went missing. The authorities reported the discovery of his corpse in a wooded area west of Tehran. Iran's government blamed an anti-regime group for the murder. If the Iranian regime wants to tout religious freedom, it should respect its citizens' right to decide one of life's most personal choices: their spiritual path. A regime that claims to observe human rights and base its actions on the peaceful nature of Islam should also explain how peace would be attained by executing a man whose only crime is his faith. By releasing Youcef Nadarkhani before Christmas, Tehran would take an important step toward respect for human rights and would give his wife and children an unforgettable gift. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roxana Saberi.","Youcef Nadarkhani was sentenced to death in Iran, says Roxana Saberi .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Oscar given Orson Welles for ""Citizen Kane"" some 70 years ago goes on sale in an online auction this month, a Los Angeles auction house announced Monday. The best screenplay award for 1941 was the only Oscar for the legendary writer, director, actor, although he was given an honorary award ""for superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures"" nearly 30 years later. Welles was 25 when he wrote, directed and starred in ""Citizen Kane,"" which the American Film Institute picked in 2007 as the top film of the previous century. The golden statuette's controversial history includes a court fight with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which tried to stop another auction in 2003. An academy official testified then that the award's value was at least $1 million. A judge cleared the way for auction with a ruling in 2004 that Welles never signed the academy's agreement not to sell the trophy, according to Nate D. Sanders Auctions spokesman Sam Heller. The academy, which aggressively challenges efforts to sell Oscar trophies, was successful three years ago in stopping the sale of two Oscars awarded to silent film star Mary Pickford. A Los Angeles jury ruled the descendants of a woman who was married to Pickford's third husband could only sell the statuettes back to the academy for a price of $10. Heller would not identify the seller, although it was known to be in the hands of Beatrice Welles, the actor's youngest daughter, after she recovered it from a planned auction in 1993. It had been ""assumed to be lost"" for decades but was apparently in the hands of a cinematographer who got it from Welles, Heller said. An attempt to sell it at auction in 2007 failed to draw a buyer, Heller said. It was included in a lot of historical manuscripts, not movie memorabilia, he said. ""Citizen Kane,"" Welles' first feature film, was nominated for nine Oscars but won just for best screenplay, which Welles shared with co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz. Welles, who portrayed a fictional media tycoon, lost to Gary Cooper in ""Sergeant York"" for the best actor award. John Ford's direction of ""How Green Was My Valley"" beat Welles for best director. The bidding in the online auction will end on the evening of December 20, Heller said.","""Citizen Kane"" best screenplay award is the only Oscar Orson Welles won .

"(CNN) -- As it slowly became clear that quarterback Peyton Manning would not be healthy enough to play for the Indianapolis Colts this season, his teammates embraced the following rallying cry: . ""We're not just a one-man team,'' they would say defensively. ""We've still got Pro Bowl players here. We can still win games.'' Most of us bought in. Why wouldn't we? There was a culture of winning -- a Super Bowl title, another Super Bowl appearance, 12-win seasons as a matter of habit -- and lots of players remaining who were an integral part of establishing that culture. Look at the remaining roster: Top receiver Reggie Wayne and tight end Dallas Clark. Defensive ends Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis. Top-tier center Jeff Saturday. And then they lost their first 13 games of the 2011 football season, and have a chance to become just the third team in the National Football League's modern history to finish the year without a win or a tie. Not a one-man team? Now we know better. Manning, the Hall of Fame-worthy 35-year-old quarterback, firmly established himself as the most irreplaceable player in the game this season, and did it without taking a single snap. Some have even suggested he deserves Most Valuable Player consideration: With him, the Colts are a perennial Super Bowl contender, without him they're a laughingstock. One player can have this kind of understandable impact in the NBA, where a LeBron James can leave Cleveland Cavaliers and reduce them from a 60-win team to the worst team in the league. In the NBA, you're talking about five players on the court at a time. Nobody could have imagined this would happen in football, where Manning is one of 11 players, and doesn't play defense or special teams. When the New England Patriots lost Tom Brady for the 2008 season, they still went 11-5. The Colts, who two years ago were in the middle of a debate over whether an undefeated season was possible, are now wondering if they will win a single game. We've always known Manning is the face of the franchise (and, to a certain extent, the entire NFL). Now we're finding out he's the heart, the soul, the brains ... everything. The Colts aren't just losing this season; they're barely competitive, enduring a season that included a nationally televised, 62-7 shellacking by the Saints in New Orleans. ""I'm shocked,'' Colts guard Ryan Diem said recently. ""How can you not be?'' The Colts entered the season believing that Manning, coming off his second neck surgery, would become available sometime within the first month of the season. But the pain and weakness persisted in Manning's shoulder and arm. It was then determined Manning should undergo his third neck surgery in 19 months, a single-level anterior fusion. ""That offense has evolved around a special guy,'' Kerry Collins, a veteran quarterback the Colts signed to replace Manning, told the New York Times. ""Peyton has a football IQ that is off the charts and a physical gift as well. There is no way to go in there and run the offense like he does.'' The bottom line is this: The Colts were built around Manning. For more than a decade, that was an understandable approach. The Colts were beacons of enduring excellence, one of the best franchises in the NFL and all of sports. But when the foundation is removed, the entire structure crumbles. All the Colts' best players are reliant on Manning. The receivers, Pierre Garcon, Austin Collie and Wayne. The tight end, Clark. The two pass rushers, Freeney and Mathis, do their best work when their team has a lead, and the Colts aren't doing that. Meanwhile, nobody's quite sure when and if Manning will return. He announced two weeks ago that the neck fusion was progressing and he could increase the intensity of his rehabilitation. It remains highly unlikely, though, that he will practice with the team the remaining three weeks of the season. So now it gets weirdly interesting. Turns out the Colts picked the perfect year to stink. If they get the first pick in the draft -- and they have a two-game lead on Minnesota and St. Louis with three games remaining -- they will be in position to pick Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck , by most accounts the best quarterback prospect to come out of college since Hall of Famer John Elway left Stanford and joined the Denver Broncos in 1983. Not a bad deal: The Colts get 13 years of elite quarterbacking from Manning, suffer for one season, then get Luck for another decade or more of elite quarterbacking. But then the question becomes, what do the Colts do with Luck and Manning? SI video on Manning and Luck . Last week, Manning's father, former NFL quarterback Archie Manning, told two different radio shows that Luck and Peyton would not be able to play on the same team. The argument was that both would want to play right away and should play right away. Manning expects to be healthy, and Luck is viewed as the most NFL-ready quarterback to come out of college in years. (Archie backtracked on those comments one day later). Here's the rub: The Colts have to decide whether to give Manning a $28 million option bonus in early March. The simplest option would be to let Manning leave as a free agent -- although it's never simple when emotions are involved and it involves a transcendent civic icon. The other option is to pay the money and then figure things out. But it's not as simple as paying the cash and then trading him. The bonus is due in early March. The league year, which would be the first opportunity for the Colts to make a trade, begins March 15. If the Colts wanted to trade Manning, it would cost them $28 million, plus they would take a $38 million cap hit (NFL teams have a maximum amount to spend each year on player salaries and bonuses). That's an enormous number and would not allow them to field a competitive team. Indianapolis fans would like to keep Manning for a couple of years and then transition to Luck. But that's a tough call, too. Luck has not yet addressed the situation, but there's reason to believe he would have no interest in sitting behind Manning for two or three years. As a first pick, he would have leverage, and could force the Colts to trade his pick, as was the case with Elway and Eli Manning. Let's say the Colts keep Manning for a year and then deal him: It's a $28 million cap hit, still enormous, leaving them short of cap money to surround Luck with talented players. ""We aren't close to making any decisions,'' Colts vice chairman Bill Polian said. More and more, it looks like the Colts will have to make a clean break and move into the Luck Era. The more immediate concern, though, is this: . They just want to win a game.","The Colts have gone winless without injured starting quarterback Peyton Manning .
Manning has led the team to unprecedented success and a Super Bowl championship .
Colts will be in position to draft Andrew Luck if they finish with the NFL's worst record .
Colts might end up with a decision to make between Manning and Luck ."
"(CNN) -- ""At one point we killed eight people in 15 minutes. The protesters were unarmed. They didn't even have rocks! That's when I decided to defect. I threw away my gun and ran towards the protesters."" ""About 1,500 protesters came.....They requested the release of an injured protester who was inside the hospital. They held olive branches. They had no arms. There were 35 army soldiers and about 50 mukhabarat personnel at the checkpoint. We also had a jeep with a mounted machine-gun. When the protesters were less than 100 meters away, we opened fire."" These statements are part of the testimony of two Syrian soldiers who say they deserted after being ordered by officers to fire on unarmed protesters. They are among 63 who have fled to neighboring countries and told Human Rights Watch of their experiences. The organization has documented incidents where soldiers say they were ordered to kill or torture protestors, went on looting rampages or witnessed other soldiers being shot or tortured for disobeying orders or desertion. The report, released Thursday, is titled, ""By All Means Necessary,"" borrows the language allegedly used by officers as they issued orders to soldiers to put down protests. It identifies 74 commanders and officials accused of ordering attacks on unarmed protestors. The testimony is frequently harrowing. A soldier from the 9th Division recounted that on April 28 he was sent to a checkpoint to prevent protesters from marching on the capital, Damascus. ""People were approaching from different sides, and one guy came up to me and screamed, ""'If you are a man, shoot me!' The same moment, a mukhabarat guy next to me shot him in the shoulder, at close range, and tried to arrest him. His mother approached us and said, 'Let him go; take me instead!,' and a mukhabarat guy in civilian clothes in front of me shot the guy point blank and killed him, in front of his mother."" The mukhabarat are members of the the feared military intelligence service regarded as regime loyalists. At about the same time - in Daraa, where the protests began - a soldier alleged that his commander stood in front of the brigade and ordered: ""Use heavy shooting. Nobody will ask you to explain."" Another soldier deployed to Bukamal in May said his commander made it clear that the unit's ""job was not to arrest people, but to kill."" According to the soldier, the commander gave verbal orders to ""kill anyone putting up resistance, regardless of whether they are men, women, or children."" HRW says it interviewed 63 defectors from the armed forces over a period of six months, talking to them ""and other witnesses separately and at length. ""Violations described in this report are those that several defectors described separately,"" HRW says. Most of the interviewees were conscripts but several were officers. One soldier said in the early days of the protests, commanders would brief their men ""about how good Assad and his family were, and about the threats from the terrorists. And then they also forbade us from taking leave."" Many of the soldiers said they were convinced that the government's claims were false when they went on leave and realized that ""close relatives and friends were participating in the protests and had been attacked by the security forces."" The Syrian government continues to maintain that ""armed gangs"" and terrorists, incited from outside Syria, have been attacking the security forces. In an interview with the U.S. network ABC a week ago, President Bashar al Assad said he was not responsible for any misconduct by the security forces. ""I don't own them. I'm president. I don't own the country, so they're not my forces,"" he said. But some of the soldiers interviewed by HRW accuse senior officers close to the president of ordering them to shoot protestors. One man who says he served in the 4th Division said a brigadier general had instructed them to shoot at protestors in Damascus. He says he later found out that ""the orders came from Maher al-Assad, de facto commander of the 4th Division and President al-Assad's younger brother."" Another soldier with the 4th Division said that his unit was deployed to make arrests in a Damascus neighborhood in May. ""We had batons, and the shabeeha (a government militia) had weapons; they wore black clothes. We were running after people, and those we grabbed wished they had died because of how badly we beat them."" A captain ""used to shoot with his pistol at those we couldn't catch."" A former lieutenant colonel in the Presidential Guard described the torture of a man on the ""wanted list"" who had been detained in a suburb of Damascus in August. ""When I came, he was still alive,"" the former officer related. 'He was screaming, and the soldiers were swearing and laughing. It lasted for about five minutes longer, and then he died."" The report also details ruthless treatment of soldiers who tried to avoid killing protesters. One soldier said that during a protest in Damascus in April, a young conscript called Yusuf was shooting in the air and not at protestors. A military intelligence officer ""called a sniper on the roof, pointed at Yusuf, and the sniper then shot Yusuf twice in the head. Intelligence agents took Yusuf's body away. The next day we saw Yusuf's body on TV. They said that he had been killed by terrorists."" The soldiers also describe ""sweeps"" of neighborhoods where protests were common, with hundreds of arbitrary arrests. Among incidents of looting described, one soldier said that ""in Bayda we broke the doors and took whatever we wanted. The mukhabarat was arresting people; in one area, they arrested ten old men to force their children to turn themselves in. The same continued in Banyas, where we went the next days. In Basateen, we looted everything, both my unit and others."" HRW says defections from the Syrian armed forces and intelligence agencies appear to have steadily increased since the protests began in March. HRW says the UN Security Council should ensure the accountability of the officers named ""up to the very highest levels of the Syrian government"" by referring Syria to the International Criminal Court. ""Try as he may to distance himself from responsibility for his government's relentless brutality, President Assad's claim that he did not actually order the crackdown does not absolve him of criminal responsibility,"" says Anna Neistat, one of the report's authors. ""The ongoing killings, arrests, repression, and general denials of responsibility by the Syrian government also make clear that officials have failed to take any meaningful action to address these abuses,"" HRW concludes. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights estimates that some 5,000 people have been killed in Syria's unrest. On Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon said: ""This cannot go on. In the name of humanity, it is time for the international community to act."" The report comes out a day after there were unconfirmed reports that 33 people were killed in Syria. The deaths were reported by the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition group that organizes and documents protests. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of violence in Syria because the government restricts access by foreign journalists.","HRW interviews 63 Syrian soldiers that have defected .

"American Fork, Utah (CNN) -- Pharmacies in Utah and Illinois are at the heart of an illicit nationwide network providing prescription drugs over the internet, federal agents state in court papers filed in two cities. In search warrant affidavits obtained by CNN, agents said the business was centered around two pharmacies, one in the Chicago suburb of Des Plaines, Illinois, and the other here in this small town south of Salt Lake City. According to the affidavits, both pharmacies are owned by the same man, Kyle Rootsaert -- the subject of a 2008 report by CNN. One of them, the Des Plaines company now called Rand Pharmacy, combined with another unidentified pharmacy to ship 30,000 packages of prescription drugs across the country during the first six months of 2010. ""This is a pretty large ring of at least 200 websites that acted as internet pharmacies that were basically selling drugs -- prescription drugs -- without requiring a valid prescription,"" John Horton, a former official in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, told CNN. ""These affidavits indicate this was a multiyear, multimillion-dollar operation involving thousands and thousands of prescriptions. Going back in time, there were even deaths involved with this organization."" The affidavits say most of the drugs were highly addictive, especially muscle relaxants called Soma and tramadol. And the majority of the prescriptions, a government source told CNN, were authorized by the same physician, Dr. William E. Morrow of Layton, Utah, who had never seen or even talked with those ordering the drugs online, according to the documents. Utah state records show Morrow's license to dispense controlled drugs was revoked for three years, beginning in 1999, because he prescribed such substances without following proper procedure. He paid a $1,000 fine and was again allowed to dispense controlled drugs in 2002. His license to practice medicine was not suspended. CNN's Special Investigations Unit first examined Rootsaert and Roots Pharmacy, the company he owns in American Fork, in 2008. CNN Correspondent Drew Griffin ordered the antidepressant Prozac over the internet without a doctor's prescription, and the pills were delivered by overnight express the following day. The affidavits show federal agents doing essentially the same thing in a series of test buys between 2008 and April 2010 -- ordering drugs from a variety of websites and receiving the pills within a day or two. In addition, the agents received dozens of follow-up e-mails encouraging them to purchase more drugs. Spokesmen for the U.S. attorney's offices in both Utah and Chicago declined to comment. But former White House official John Horton, who now is president of an online pharmacy watchdog site called LegitScript.com, told CNN that the cash involved is significant. ""With approximately 5,000 prescriptions being processed a month, at roughly $100 a prescription, that's at least, what? A half a million a month being made by this operation alone,"" Horton told CNN. Rootsaert did not return phone calls or answer a knock on his door. His lawyer, Peter Stirba, told CNN in an e-mail that he had not had an opportunity to speak with his client about the affidavits. CNN was able to locate Morrow, approaching him in his driveway as he arrived home. He quickly ordered CNN's team to leave. ""I don't want to talk now,"" he said. ""Now get off the property.

"(CNN) -- Juventus retained their unbeaten record and went back to the top of Italy's Serie A table with a 2-0 victory over 10-man Cesena on Sunday. Cesena were 17 minutes from claiming a hard-earned point until Claudio Marchisio and Arturo Vidal played a neat one-two before Marchioso fired home from the edge of the area. The visitors' fate was sealed in controversial circumstances seven minutes from time with goalkeeper Francesco Antonioli was sent off for an innocuous-looking coming together with Emanuele Giacherini. Poland and Ukraine primed for Euro 2012 kick-off . With Cesena having made all their substitutions, defender Giullermo Rodriguez had to go in goal and his first job was to pick Vidal's penalty out of the net. The result leaves Juventus two point clear of AC Milan and Udinese, who both won earlier in the weekend, with 13 matches played. Lazio are a further five points behind in fourth place, although they can close the gap against Novara on Monday. In other matches, Roma finished with a remarkable eight men as they crashed to a 3-0 humiliation at Fiorentina. Juan was the first to be dismissed, after giving away a spot-kick from which Stevan Jovetic scored. Alessandro Gamberini's header made it 2-0 before Roma had Fernando Gago sent off for a second booking. To complete Roma's misery, they had Bojan Krkic dismissed late on for handball on the line and Santiago Silva netted Fiorentina's second penalty. Meanwhile, Victor Ibarbo scored a stunning individual goal to give Cagliari a 1-0 victory over Catania for their first win in eight games. In other news, Lecce confirmed on Sunday that they had sacked coach Eusebio Di Francesco and replaced him with Serse Cosmi. Lecce, who are bottom of the table with just eight points from 13 matches, made the decision after Saturday's 4-2 defeat at Napoli. Di Francesco becomes the eighth coaching casualty of the Italian Serie A season. Meanwhile, in Spain's La Liga, on-loan Arsenal striker Carlos Vela hit a spectacular late goal as Real Sociedad scored twice in the last two minutes to snatch a 3-2 home win over Malaga. Vela's overhead kick made it 2-2 before Uruguayan John Ifran grabbed a last-gasp winner to lift Sociedad up to 13th place. In other matches, Falcao hit his eighth goal of the season to help Atletico Madrid beat Rayo Vallecano 3-1, a result that moves them up to eighth in the table. And a goal on half-time from on-loan Nigerian Odion Ighalo gave Granada a 1-0 success over Real Zaragoza, who are now bottom of the table on 10 points after the defeat.","Juventus are back on top of the Serie A table after defeating 10-men Cesena 2-0 .

"(Lonely Planet) -- Stingray City is often considered to be one of the best shallow dives and snorkeling spots in the world and an undoubted highlight of any trip to the Cayman Islands. This stretch of sandy seafloor in Grand Cayman's North Sound is the meeting place for southern stingrays hungry for a meal. As soon as you enter the water, several of the beautiful prehistoric-looking creatures will glide up to you to suck morsels of squid from your tentative fingers. Lonely Planet: The 10 ultimate Bahamas experiences . So, how did they get so tame? Years ago, Grand Cayman's popular North Sound has a cut in the reef which was a popular route for fishermen to enter and then sit in calm water while cleaning the day's catch. As they threw the bones and guts overboard, rays would come and feed on the discarded fish parts. These days, the fishermen have long gone but the stingrays remain, flashing their brilliant white undersides as they soar across the reef. Those unaccustomed to seeing rays might not realize what a rare sight this is. Stingrays prefer to bury themselves under the sand, with only their bulbous eyes remaining above the ocean floor, keeping a watchful eye out for predators such as Caribbean reef sharks or hammerheads. Should they be attacked, rays have one weapon in their arsenal -- a serrated, venomous-sheathed barb, four to eight inches long, that can be used to ward off enemies or someone settling on top of them. These can inflict a painful wound in humans which may quickly become infected, and if the barb breaks off, it must be surgically removed. That's unlikely to happen in this unique sphere, however, where the rays have become accustomed to humans. As tempting as it seems, care should be taken not to touch these wild creatures; rays have a protective mucous on their skins, and touching them can remove this coating, leaving them vulnerable to infection. Lonely Planet: 10 great Caribbean secrets . Diving and snorkeling . A popular wading and snorkeling spot, Sandbar, is about two miles east of Stingray City. Here you can watch the rays zip through the waters to be hand-fed squid. Usually they remain here all day, departing at night in search of crustacean snacks along the reef. Stingray City's famous diving is fun, shallow and located in a beautiful setting. A dive starts with a fascinating insight into the lives of these graceful creatures, and an on-board briefing about how to settle on the bottom and interact with them. While this is mainly a shallow dive site, people snorkel above the feeders to watch as the water is crystal clear. Ray wranglers may even swim up with a ray or two following, to give snorkelers a closer look. Upon descending, hungry rays will probably already be near the boat. If not, it is a thrilling sight to see a group of anywhere from four to 14 stingrays winding their way toward you across the snow white sand. Rays here have been measured at over 4 foot across and weighing over 125 pounds. There have even been reports of 6 foot rays, which far exceeds their normal adult size. There are few places like this in the world to enjoy interaction with such an enigmatic sea creature. Many divers and snorkelers come back for second and third helpings; so don't forget to bring a waterproof camera. Lonely Planet: Top 10 Puerto Rico experiences . © 2011 Lonely Planet.

"(CNN) -- Sports loom large in the public's mind today. From the Penn State and Syracuse scandals to the upcoming BCS Bowl Series and the NFL playoffs, much attention is being paid to our athletes and coaches. These men have enormous impact on the lives of our children, which makes the focus on actions at Penn State and Syracuse universities necessary and the mockery of the actions of honorable men, such as Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow, so disheartening. Tebow continues to win games. This Sunday he again led the Broncos to victory. He's now 6-1 this year as a starter, the Broncos are in first place in their division, and he has led the team to the most road wins in a row since John Elway. Tebow is a good man and a good football player. He's a man of character, faith and integrity. He's also a Heisman Trophy winner, a two-time BCS national champion and arguably one of the greatest college football players of all time. Tebow is a role model for sports fans everywhere. But instead of lifting him up, too many commentators, critics and even fellow athletes mock and deride him and hope that he fails. The latest example is ""Tebowing,"" where one kneels in prayer with his or her head bent in mockery of Tebow's usual touchdown celebration prayer. Several weeks ago, Detroit Lions' linebacker Stephen Tulloch ""Tebowed"" after sacking Tebow and Detroit tight end Tony Scheffler ""Tebowed"" after catching a touchdown against the Broncos. Critics like to pretend that it's Tebow's football style that bothers them. Tebow hasn't yet proven to be a natural pocket passer, but in his last start he threw for more than 200 yards with two touchdowns, no interceptions and a passer rating near 150, and he continues to lead game-winning drives almost every week. There is always room for healthy criticism in sports, especially at the quarterback position, but Tebow is subject to something uglier. Sportscasters love to take extra shots at Tebow; take Merril Hoge, who at one point tweeted, ""It's embarrassing to think the Broncos could win with Tebow!!"" Critics have a problem with who Tebow is as a man. They are bothered by his faith, character and conviction. Jake Plummer, former Broncos quarterback, said in a recent interview, ""I wish he'd just shut up."" They tell him to take his ""holier than thou"" faith off the field. Too many in our culture deride good men such as Tebow because they make them feel uncomfortable. These same critics believe the Aha! theory of human behavior. This theory assumes that the real character of a person is always base and hidden from the eye and that all good actions are a front for ulterior and bad or low motives. Aha! Tim Tebow, you say you're Christian, but we know it's a facade for sympathy and attention. You're just like the rest of us. C.S. Lewis warned us of this. He wrote in ""The Abolition of Man,"" ""We make men without chests and expect from them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst."" We scoff at Tebow and all that he represents and are horrified at the scandals at Penn State and Syracuse. We are right to be horrified, but we shouldn't make fun of our good men. Men such as Tebow are not in over supply. Despite what his critics say, he should not stop what he is doing. We need men like him, the type of men many fathers would want their daughters to marry and many mothers would want their sons to grow up to be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","Tim Tebow is proving to be a winning quarterback for the Denver Broncos .

"(CNN) -- Madonna will take center stage at halftime of Super Bowl XLVI, flanked by Cirque du Soleil performers in what traditionally is one of the year's most watched shows. The NFL announced Sunday night, in a press release, that the Michigan-born singer would headline the halftime show on February 5, 2012, at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. She follows other high-profile acts in recent years, including the Black Eyed Peas and Usher during the most recent edition of pro football's championship game at Cowboys Stadium in Texas. Other past performers including Bruce Springsteen, Prince, The Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney. The halftime show has also been the subject of controversy, specifically in 2004 during Janet Jackson's infamous ""wardrobe malfunction"" while singing alongside Justin Timberlake. The league calls the show ""the most-watched musical event of the year,"" with more than 162 million people tuning in last year in the United States alone. A 2008 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Madonna is ranked by the Guinness Book of World Records as the top-selling female recording artist of all time. She erupted on the scene in the '80s, selling 60 million records that decade and scoring several No. 1 hits including ""Like a Virgin,"" ""Papa Don't Preach"" and ""Crazy for You."" She continued her momentum in the 1990s with her Blonde Ambition Tour and also made headlines as a provocateur for her album ""Erotica"" and X-rated picture book ""Sex."" Even with a growing family, Madonna has continued working -- including releasing several more albums and books. She has also acted in several films over the course of her career such as ""Evita,"" ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" and ""Dick Tracy.""","Cirque du Soleil will perform alongside Madonna, the NFL announces .

"(CNN) -- Four years ago, Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul had raised $8.3 million by the end of the third quarter of 2007. One-third of that came in small, unitemized contributions of under $200 each -- the proverbial ""small donor"" giving that is the mark of a grass-roots based campaign. In the 2012 cycle, he has raised $15.4 million through September 30, of which 41% has come in amounts under $200. Four years ago, according to the Campaign Finance Institute (my source for all these numbers), by September 30 Paul had a little more than 7,000 itemized individual donors -- the people who give between $201 and the top individual limit, which was then $2,300 (and is now $2,500). This time around, he had more than 12,000 itemized individual donors at the end of September. (By comparison, Mitt Romney only had 19,700 itemized individual donors this past September 30, compared to 29,700 four years ago.) Clearly -- only six days before voters caucus in Iowa -- Ron Paul is doing something more right in 2012 than he did in 2008. That includes keeping his massive online base engaged after 2008 with various campaigns, including his son Rand's successful bid for the U.S. Senate. It also includes spending lots of money earlier this summer in Iowa and New Hampshire on TV ads that were far more professionally produced than anything he ran four years ago. He has spent oodles more hitting his Republican rivals hard now that the first actual caucuses and primaries are just days away. He also has developed a well-organized campaign organization on the ground, something he lacked four years ago. Says Republican online strategist Martin Avila, who worked on Paul's 2008 e-campaign, ""It's wonderful to see the campaign building early state infrastructure, something 2008 was lacking, focused on winning."" It also doesn't hurt that on some issues -- like the power of the Federal Reserve, the bailout of the banks and America's expensive wars overseas -- the questions Paul has been asking have gained in salience since 2008. That's true even if you don't agree with his answers on those issues. It probably has also helped that for almost all of the last year, the mainstream media hasn't bothered to take Paul very seriously. No less an authority than Jon Stewart has pointed out, several times, the strange bias in the media against giving Paul his due, or asking hard questions of his many hyper-libertarian positions. Thus he's mostly flown under the radar, until now. Now, in this topsy-turvy presidential primary, where no one candidate seems capable of building and holding a dominating lead, Iowa polls show that Ron Paul suddenly seems on the verge of a breakthrough. Lots of observers think he may well win the caucuses by a plurality (especially if it snows and supporters of other candidates stay home). No less a sage than Nate Silver of the FiveThirtyEight blog at The New York Times says an Iowa win could give Paul a shot at winning New Hampshire. What that may mean for the larger politics of 2012 is beyond the scope of this column. But there's a paradox buried inside Paul's rise in the Republican field, a time bomb ticking away. Call it the curse of the ""Paulbots."" The more Paul rises, the more he needs to temper his rhetoric and fine-tune his message (especially given the kind of baggage he carries). And the more he needs a fine-tuned message, the more he has to control his fractious fans. But people who organize themselves online today are notoriously hard to control. Recall how in 2007, the ""Paulbots"" were everywhere: running up the numbers on every online poll they could find, generating one-day fundraising records in a desperate bid for national attention (they coined the word ""money-bomb""), and creating massive amounts of voter-generated media on his behalf. They made everything from viral videos to a Ron Paul blimp. It was, as Justine Lam, his online director from that campaign, put it to me, ""a very organic, grass-roots driven campaign."" And many of the tactics those grass-roots supporters dreamed up, like that blimp, which cost $600,000, didn't do much to actually help Paul win votes on the ground in the all-important early states. This time, Lam observes, ""There doesn't seem to be the same amount of excitement, but that could be because there's more of a typical campaigning structure around all activities this time around because of the lessons learned, the training that was done between the campaigns and probably various other reasons."" My guess is that those other reasons include the sense that, given the divided field, Paul could somehow go all the way and win the Republican nomination. And if you thought your favorite long-shot candidate was on the verge of a breakthrough, you'd probably discipline yourself, too. But things are about to get a bit crazy. Paul's late surge and possible win next week in Iowa are going to generate a huge burst of national media attention and plenty of hard-edged questions about his past and views. And the Paulbot base doesn't handle criticism very well. The other day, for example, my techPresident colleague Sarah Lai Stirland reported on a growing battle breaking out on the massive social news filtering site Reddit between Paul supporters and critics tired of their efforts to ""spam"" Redditors with slanted news favoring Paul. Vocal Paul supporters outnumber their critics on the site, but their language and tactics are often arrogant and ugly. Passion can power a campaign, but self-righteousness can also cripple it. If the Internet hyper-empowers small groups of people, enabling them to punch above their weight, it also hyper-exposes them. In the coming days, as Paul's star rises, his online base is going to be tested as much as he is. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Micah Sifry.","Ron Paul is trying to engage his massive online base with various campaigns .

"London (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to work toward lasting stability in Afghanistan in talks Saturday in the United Kingdom. The pair signed a long-term agreement on the future of Afghanistan, as they met at Cameron's official country residence, Chequers. ""The United Kingdom and Afghanistan have a strong relationship and the two countries have been working together to create a strong and stable Afghanistan,"" Cameron said. Cameron said British combat forces would remain in Afghanistan well into 2014, when NATO's International Security and Assistance Force, or ISAF, is due to hand over security to Afghan forces and withdraw. Britain has about 9,500 troops in Afghanistan, making it the second-biggest contributor to ISAF after the United States, which has about 90,000 troops there. Cameron said the NATO partners in Afghanistan would be working together to withdraw their troops in 2014 as planned. ""I don't want to see some cliff edge on our departure,"" he said. Karzai said the British prime minister had long been a friend of Afghanistan, adding: ""Based on that long-term relationship, we hope to provide a fundamentally strong, democratic state and a better, more secure region."" Karzai's U.K. visit comes a day after a British soldier was shot dead while on foot patrol in Afghanistan's Helmand province and follows stops in Italy and France. After meeting with Karzai in Paris Friday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced that France would be pulling all of its combat troops out of Afghanistan in 2013, a year ahead of schedule. His decision follows the death on January 20 of four French soldiers shot dead at their military base by a member of the Afghan National Army. Sarkozy, who faces a re-election battle this spring, said then he was suspending French training operations and combat help as a result of the attack, which injured 15 others. He paid tribute to the four soldiers at a memorial service Wednesday, speaking of the ""immense loss"" the country had suffered. The attack in eastern Afghanistan followed a similar shooting in December by an Afghan soldier that killed two French soldiers serving in an engineers' regiment. Speaking alongside Sarkozy in Paris, Karzai said: ""It is right that Afghanistan has to provide for its own security and for the protection of its own people, and for the provision of law and order -- towards which France and other allied countries have helped Afghanistan considerably in the past 10 years. ""Afghanistan because of that help is now ready to take more and more responsibility."" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Friday that France's decision to withdraw its forces early ""was not precipitous"" and had been worked through with its ISAF partners and the Afghan authorities. ""This was a national decision of France. It was done in a managed way. We will all work with it. As the president has said with regard to our own presence, we are working on 2014. The alliance as a whole is working on 2014, but we are also going to work within this French decision,"" she told reporters. France, which has been involved in Afghanistan since July 2003, has 3,935 troops there now, according to ISAF. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","NEW: Cameron and Karzai sign an agreement on the long-term future of Afghanistan .

"London (CNN) -- A newly-discovered work by Spanish ""Old Master"" Diego Velazquez has sold at auction for $4.7 million, after it was spotted in a group of paintings by a largely-forgotten British artist. ""Portrait of a Gentleman"" was originally thought to be by 19th century British artist Matthew Shepperson -- but the change of attribution meant it sold for 10,000 times its original estimate. The work came to light when a descendant of Shepperson put a number of his paintings up for sale in August 2010. As such, it would have been expected to sell for between $320 and $480. Instead -- following more than a year of tests, X-rays and research -- it was confirmed as a Velazquez, and so became the highlight of Wednesday's old masters sale at Bonhams in London. Previously unknown Velazquez discovered . Diego Rodriguez de Silva y Velazquez (1599 - 1660) was the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain, and is best known for his portraits of the royal family, including his masterpiece, Las Meninas. The identity of the ""Gentleman"" in the portrait is not known, but it is thought he may be Juan Mateos, the king's master of the hunt. Andrew Mckenzie, the company's director of old master paintings said the portrait was of ""outstanding quality"" and had ""extraordinary presence."" A spokeswoman for the auction house said that following a lot of interest, the Velazquez work was eventually bought by an American dealer. She said the company was ""very pleased"" with the sale, which also saw the world record for a work by Dutch artist Adriaen Coorte smashed when his ""Three peaches on a stone ledge with a Painted Lady butterfly"" went under the hammer for $3.3 million.","Previously unknown work by Diego Velazquez sells at auction in London for $4.7m .

"(CNN) -- Banana-Sam, a much-loved squirrel-monkey stolen from his enclosure at the San Francisco Zoo, has been safely returned, officials said. The monkey was found Saturday night -- a day after he disappeared from the zoo -- at a park by a passer-by who spotted the primate in the bushes, the San Francisco Police Department said in a statement. The passer-by coaxed the monkey from the bushes into his backpack, and then called the authorities, according to the statement. Police officers brought the monkey to the zoo, where officials determined it was the missing primate. ""Although hungry, trembling and thirsty, Banana-Sam is currently safe back,"" the zoo said in a statement. Zoo workers discovered the theft Friday morning, when they found a back perimeter gate had been breached and two holes cut in the mesh fence of the squirrel monkey exhibit. The male monkey, known as Banana-Sam to his keepers, is age 17, over 12 inches tall and weighs about 2 lbs. Corrine MacDonald, the curator of primates and carnivores, told CNN affiliate KGO earlier Saturday that squirrel monkeys can live into their 20s, saying his relatively advanced age could put him at more risk. Banana Sam' keepers warned the public that while he looks very cute, he is not a pet -- and can deliver a nasty nip. The curator said such monkeys carry diseases and can cause serious infections if they bite a human. The monkey needs a specialized diet to stay healthy, the zoo says. What motivated the thieves to swipe the monkey is not clear. Common squirrel monkeys are not endangered, and they can be found at pet trade markets -- with such sales illegal in California, the zoo says -- or medical research institutions. MacDonald said the zoo's other squirrel monkeys were visibly shaken by Banana-Sam's apparent capture. She said the decision was made to pull them off the exhibit due to concerns about the integrity of the exhibit and that a ""copy-cat"" could try to take other monkeys. It was not immediately known when the zoo planned to reopen the exhibit. An unknown person was quick to set up a fake Twitter account in Banana-Sam's name, following in the path of a cobra that escaped at New York's Bronx Zoo in March. The snake's mock Twitter account, with humorous tweets on its supposed whereabouts in New York City, swiftly attracted a large online following. Under the handle @SF_BananaSam, the ""monkey"" is now tweeting his way round San Francisco. ""Went to monkey bars in Golden Gate Park playground, left disappointed. #nobananadaiquiri"" one post reads. Another says: ""I'm a funny-looking vegan who ran away from home and who people follow on Twitter. IN other words, A NORMAL SAN FRANCISCAN."" CNN's Leslie Tripp and Maria P. White contributed to this report.","New: Banana Sam was found in San Francisco park, police say .

"London (CNN) -- Ancient Egyptian mummies kept in storage for half a century have gone on display in new state-of-the-art galleries at the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology at the University of Oxford. Painted wooden sarcophagi decorated with charms, and carefully wrapped and embalmed bodies are now on view in climate-controlled cases following twelve months of painstaking conservation work, alongside a rich array of artifacts from the Nile Valley. They include the almost 3,000-year-old coffin of a High Priest named Iahtefnakt, which was carefully conserved over nine months before its unveiling. But these fragile artifacts haven't just received cosmetic work. The mummy of a man named Djeddjehutyiuefankh, who is thought to have been buried in during the 25th dynasty (between 712 and 770 BC) underwent a CT scan at a nearby hospital in Oxford. The scan revealed amulets in the mouth cavity and stone coverings over the eyes -- and a nearly 3,000-year-old mystery. ""It's intriguing, because his heart was gone and normally you'd expect the heart to be in situ,"" said Mark Norman, Head of Conservation at the museum. This is because Ancient Egyptians believed they would have to endure a ritual known as ""the weighing of the heart"" before a monster in the underworld known as the Devourer. If their hearts were pure, they could pass into the next life; if not, the heart would be eaten. The cause of Djeddjehutyiuefankh's death is unknown, but, said Norman, there was no sign of broken bones. In addition to the CT scan of the mummy, the conservation team also used infra-red imaging to see under-drawings beneath Roman-era paintings and used forensic techniques to detect the pigments and materials that ancient artisans would have used. These discoveries were a ""buzz"" for Norman and the team of conservators at the museum. ""We get closer to the object than anyone since the object was made -- sometimes even closer, because we use microscopy and image enhancing,"" he said. ""The role of conservation is changing and it's much more about material forensic science,"" said Norman. The Ashmolean Museum is one of the leading centers for the display and study of ancient Egypt and Nubia (modern-day Sudan). Its collection contains a number of artifacts excavated by the so-called ""fathers"" of modern archaeology, including Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie and Francis Llewellyn Griffith, who were working in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. It even includes items excavated in the 1600s. Highlights from the collection are being displayed in the museum's recently redeveloped galleries and include 5,000-year-old limestone statues, the Nubian Shrine of Taharqa -- the only complete freestanding Pharaonic building in Britain -- and Roman-era portraits of mummies. Liam McNamara, Assistant Keeper of the Ancient Egypt & Sudan collection at the Ashmolean, hopes the museum's redeveloped Ancient Egypt and Nubia galleries, which open to the public Saturday, will showcase the reality of ancient Egypt and help dispel some of the myths surrounding the ancient civilization. ""The reality of ancient Egypt is equally as exciting as some of the bizarre myths that have been created around it and hopefully the new exhibits at the Ashmolean will inspire the next generation of Egyptologists,"" he said.","Ancient Egyptian mummies kept in storage for years are now on display at Oxford's Ashmolean Museum .

"(CNN) -- The scandal-hit Olympus Corp. will appoint a board to decide whether the Japanese company should take legal action and file criminal complaints against executives who helped hide $1.7 billion in losses, the company president said Wednesday. The comments from Olympus President Shuichi Takayama come a day after the findings of a scathing independent panel report that suggested the Japanese company ""should remove its malignant cancer. ""The management was rotten to the core, and infected those around it,"" the panel's report said. The panel, led by a former Japanese Supreme Court judge, detailed $1.7 billion of hidden losses from failed investments in the 1990s by the camera and medical equipment maker. The report, issued Tuesday, blasted the culture of the company that allowed the losses to be disguised in dubious fees and overvalued payments for companies, as well as the tight control of former company Chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa. Olympus has lost half its share value in the wake of the October 14 firing of former CEO Michael Woodford, the first foreigner to lead the company, after Woodford questioned the company's accounting. After Woodford went public with his claims, the company's share value dropped by as much as 75%. Three former executives, including Kikukawa, have since resigned from the company's management. ""One had to be prepared to be kicked out of the company in order to make objection even if it was the right thing to do (this is also apparent in how Woodford was treated),"" the panel wrote in its report. The panel reiterated its earlier announcement that their investigation found no link to ""anti-social forces,"" a euphemism to Japanese organized crime. Company officials said in a statement that the report ""includes both new revelations and recommendations on the future management of Olympus (and) will be taken into serious consideration by the company."" The independent panel recommended the resignation of the entire Olympus board. Takayama said at Wednesday's press conference that he and the board will resign but not until the ""exact responsibilities"" of wrongdoing are revealed by investigators. Resignations and changes to company management would likely come after a shareholder's meeting sometime in February. The company faces a December 14 deadline to resubmit its financial statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange or face delisting. Company officials have repeatedly said they will turn in the required documents before next week's deadline. The Olympus saga started with a five-page expose in Japanese magazine FACTA -- a small circulation magazine that has only nine people on staff -- on July 20 that raised questions over advisory fees of $687 million paid in 2008 for the purchase of Gyrus, a UK medical instruments firm. The article also questioned the $773 million paid for three small Japanese companies -- a face cream maker, a plastic container maker and a recycling business, each with fewer than 50 employees. Woodford has led a public campaign since his dismissal to get rid of the company board, and has said he would return to run the company if asked. ""The panel's report has made one thing painfully clear: the massive scale of the malfeasance from which the present directors and statutory auditors persistently averted their gaze,"" Woodford said in a statement. ""I sought to call attention to the wrongdoing through a series of six letters in English and Japanese, copied to all the members of the board, and through the submission of a damning report by Price Waterhouse Coopers. Yet not a single director stood up in support of my efforts to expose what had taken place."" Takayama said the board will decide whether to bring Woodford back at the next shareholders meeting. ""Woodford did what we all couldn't do, so we praise him for that,"" Takayama said.

"(CNN) -- The Dutch Cup tie abandoned last week after a fan ran on to the pitch to attack AZ Alkmaar goalkeeper Esteban Alvarado will be replayed on January 19 behind closed doors, the Netherlands football federation (KNVB) said Wednesday. The match at Ajax's Amsterdam Arena on December 22 was being led 1-0 by the home side when the incident occurred just before halftime. Costa Rican 'keeper Alvarado reacted by twice kicking out at the fan, who was then escorted from the pitch by police. Alvarado and his teammates were enraged when he was subsequently red-carded by the referee and there were ugly scenes on the pitch. AZ coach Gertjan Verbeek then led his players off, complaining about the lack of security at Ajax's ground, and the match was abandoned. The KNVB has since overturned the red card for Alvarado and fined Ajax 10,000 euros ($12,934). ""The Federation does not want to take any risk regarding the playing of this match while guaranteeing that the competition continues,"" a KNVB statement on its website said to explain the decision to stage a replay of the match without any fans. Out with the old and in with the new in 2012 . Ajax have until January 2 to appeal. In other football news Wednesday, Liverpool's former Ajax striker Luis Suarez has been banned by the English Football Association (FA) for one match and fined 20,000 pounds ($31,300) for a gesture made towards Fulham fans in the 1-0 defeat at Craven Cottage earlier this month. Uruguay international Suarez had admitted the latest charge of improper conduct, and Liverpool have also been fined the same amount for failing to control their players in the same match -- a charge related to the dismissal of midfielder Jay Spearing. It is a further blow for Suarez, who has starred for Liverpool since his move from Dutch football last season. It comes a little over a week after he was given an eight-game suspension for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a match in October. That ban is currently on hold while Liverpool decide whether to appeal, but Suarez's new suspension means he will miss Friday's home game against Newcastle United in the English Premier League.","AZ Alkmaar - Ajax Dutch Cup tie to be replayed on January 19 behind closed doors .

"(CNN)  -- Luke Donald demands perfection of himself and his caddy on the golf course, so when CNN presenter Shane O'Donoghue was given the chance to carry the world No. 1's bag for a few holes, he knew the learning curve would be steep. Donald reached the top of the rankings earlier this year by winning the PGA Championship at Wentworth -- despite the best efforts of O'Donoghue to derail his effort in a practice round for the European Tour's prestige event. Donald's regular caddy John McClaren was on hand to give some useful tips, but it appeared wasted on the Living Golf host. Donning a fetching pair of shorts and the obligatory caddy's bib, O'Donoghue hardly made the best impression on their first hole, the 15th at Wentworth, when he marched down the fairway without a key item. ""You will need the clubs, that's the first thing!"" said McClaren, Donald's caddy since the Englishman parted company with his brother Christian, who had previously carried his bag throughout his professional career. ""It was affecting our relationship,"" Donald told O'Donoghue. ""I'd rather have him as a brother than a caddy."" Under McClaren, Donald has flourished, rediscovering the form that had taken him into the top 10 after victory in the 2006 Honda Classic and becoming a regular in the European Ryder Cup team. Victory at the 2011 Accenture WGC World Match Play Championship in February put him on the brink of the No. 1 spot going into May's Wentworth event. Despite his easy-going reputation, Donald's patience was clearly tested again by the enthusiastic if not exact O'Donoghue -- who next managed to leave behind another piece of golf apparel, the towel to wipe the clubs. His yardage advice also fell short of expectations when Donald hit an approach into a bunker, but saved his par with a superb up and down from the sand. A relieved O'Donoghue thanked his ""boss"" for saving his bacon as he showed just why he was about to take over from Lee Westwood at the top of the rankings -- his superb recovery play. Donald said he had made the big mistake of thinking ""I needed to hit it further"" to get to number one, and that it affected his swing and his form. ""It has taken me three or three years to get back to my best,"" he added. But a rare error off the tee at the par-five 18th at Wentworth left Donald in the trees until he brilliantly engineered another miraculous recovery. Turning to O'Donoghue for club selection, he looked a little surprised when the Irishman pulled out a three-wood and encouraged him to have a tilt at the water-protected green. Despite a good connection, the ball found a watery grave. ""You should have told me to lay up short,"" was Donald's assessment. ""He's one of the best players in the world at getting up and down from off the green,"" chipped in McClaren. ""He would have salvaged par."" Suitably chastened, O'Donoghue's first tilt as a ""professional"" caddy had ended in the golfing equivalent of a red card! Fortunately, McClaren had taken back the bag a few days later when Donald beat Westwood in a playoff to win the PGA Championship and become world number one for the first time. By then O'Donoghue was back to doing what he does best, presenting Living Golf.","Living Golf presenter Shane O'Donoghue tries his hand as Luke Donald's caddy .

"(CNN) -- Investec Loyal took line honors in the Rolex Sydney to Hobart Ocean classic Wednesday but faces an anxious wait to have the victory confirmed after an official protest by the race committee. Anthony Bell's super maxi crossed the finish line in the Tasmanian capital with a three minutes seven second advantage over five-time winner Wild Oats XI, one of the closest finishes in the race's history. But the moment of glory at Constitution Dock was short-lived as a representative of the committee immediately notified him of the protest. A crew member on Investec Loyal is alleged to have asked an Australian Broadcasting Corporation helicopter, who were covering the race for television, for information about the sails being deployed by Wild Oats XI. The incident occurred early on Tuesday morning local time as both the super maxis battled for the lead in testing conditions. ""This is assessed to breach (rule) 41 by soliciting help from an outside source,"" read a statement on the official race website. The protest hearing will be held by the International Jury at the Royal Yacht Club of Tasmania at 10.00 local time Thursday. Official Rolex Sydney Hobart race website . Cruising Yacht Club of Australia (CYCA) commodore Garry Linacre told the crowd what had happened. ""Some minutes ago I received this copy of a protest form. It is a protest form for the Rolex Sydney Hobart 2011, the organizing authority of the CYCA. ""The Race Committee, which is chaired by Tim Cox, has protested that rules may have been infringed on the 27th December at 06:30 hours, 30 nautical miles south of Merimbula. There is an ABC chopper pilot that is a nominated witness. ""I am very sorry about this event, I can assure you. Unfortunately, that has stopped our celebration here, as the result comes provisional until the protest is heard tomorrow,"" he said. Linacre went on to pay tribute to Investec Loyal for their ""magnificent sailing"" in this race and also Wild Oats XI. Skipper Bell claimed the conversation with the TV crew had just been ""a question of are they alright and have they lost any mainsails"" following rough conditions on the first night which saw a number of boats retire. ""We respect the fact that there's laws in racing... and we will of course go in and oblige that, and we're confident that the outcome will confirm our (win),"" Bell told gathered reporters. ""One thing that can't be taken away from us is that we raced one hell of a race out there, and we did everything by the book."" Wild Oats' skipper Mark Richards told the official website that Investec Loyal was a deserved winner. ""Those guys won on the water, we came second. That's how we think about it. They deserve to win,"" he said. ""Last night was a tough night. We had a fantastic lead and we ran into the new weather system and there was just no air. The other guys saw what was going on and just sailed around us. The two super maxis had fought a thrilling tactical duel along Australia's east coast with the lead changing hand several times throughout the 628 nautical miles. Investec Loyal took the lead for the first time on Tuesday night after the pair had broken away from the rest of the 88-strong fleet from the start in Sydney Harbor on Boxing Day. Light winds and the traditional difficult run to the finish on the Derwent River left the outcome in doubt to the very end, even before the protest. 2010 runner-up Investec Loyal crossed the line in two days, six hours, 14 minutes and 18 seconds, way outside the 2005 race record set by Wild Oats XI. The smallest margin of victory was back in 1982 when Condor of Bermuda pipped Apollo by just seven seconds. A separate prize for victory on handicap is also awarded as the entrants in various categories battle it out to the finish in Hobart.","Investec Loyal takes line honors in Rolex Sydney-Hobart yacht race .

"(Financial Times) -- The number of Spaniards without jobs rose by more than half a million last year to reach 5.27m, or 22.85 per cent of the workforce, in the final quarter, according to the National Statistics Institute (INE). The figures, not seasonally adjusted, confirm Spain's jobs record as by far the worst among big eurozone economies following the collapse of the Spanish housing construction bubble from 2007. Mariano Rajoy, the Popular party prime minister who took power in December, is struggling to create jobs and stop the economy shrinking even as he reinforces the budgetary austerity plans agreed by the previous government with the European Union. Spanish employers are pushing for a profound reform of the country's rigid labour market as one way of encouraging the hiring of workers and so reducing the unemployment rate, which is more than double the eurozone average. They also say the true situation is not as bad as portrayed in the statistics, because of widespread cheating by people seeking unemployment benefits while continuing to work, especially in southern Spain. Andalusia, the big region in the south, recorded the highest unemployment rate of 31.23 per cent of the workforce, according to INE, while the Basque country in the north had the lowest rate of 12.61 per cent. The quarterly survey showed 1.57m households have not a single family member in work. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","New Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy is struggling to create jobs and stop the economy shrinking .

"London (CNN) -- Phone hacking was widespread at the Daily Mirror newspaper when Piers Morgan was its editor, a former employee testified Wednesday, stopping just short of saying Morgan definitely knew about it. James Hipwell said that he ""cannot prove"" that Morgan knew about illegal eavesdropping, but that it was ""very unlikely he did not know what was going on."" Phone hacking ""happened every day"" at the Mirror's show business desk in late 1999, Hipwell told the Leveson Inquiry, a wide-ranging government-backed investigation of British press ethics and practices. Also on Wednesday, Paul McCartney's ex-wife Heather Mills accused Morgan of using her as a ""scapegoat."" Morgan, who now hosts the CNN talk show ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" testified the previous day that he did not believe phone hacking had taken place when he was editor of the tabloid. Speaking by video link, Morgan tenaciously defended himself against accusations that he knew more about phone hacking than he has admitted in the past. Some of the toughest questioning focused on a story based on a voice message McCartney left for his then-wife Mills, trying to make up after a quarrel and singing to her. Morgan refused to say who played the message for him or where, but admitted under sustained questioning that he believed it was a voice mail. ""Did you know that was unethical?"" demanded Robert Jay, the lead lawyer for the inquiry. ""Not unethical, no. It doesn't necessarily follow that it was unethical,"" Morgan said. Mills Wednesday appeared to try to shoot down speculation that she herself had played the recording for Morgan, after Judge Brian Leveson said only she could legally have given permission for him to hear it and threatened to call her to give evidence. ""I can categorically state that I have never ever played Piers Morgan a tape of any kind, never mind a voice message from my ex-husband,"" she said on her website. Morgan declined to respond. ""Piers Morgan has no additional comments re: the Leveson Inquiry or Heather Mills. His written statement and the complete transcript from the Inquiry can be found online,"" wrote a representative. In August, Mills told the BBC that a journalist working for a Mirror Group publication admitted hacking her voice mail. She said a senior Mirror Group Newspapers journalist phoned her and ""started quoting verbatim the messages from my machine."" She said she replied: ""You've obviously hacked my phone and if you do anything with this story ... I'll go to the police."" The journalist responded: ""OK, OK, yeah, we did hear it on your voice messages, I won't run it,"" according to Mills. On Wednesday, former Morgan employee Hipwell painted a picture of the editor as deeply involved in the daily workings of the paper he edited from 1995 to 2004, comparing the editor to late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Morgan ""was the 'Dear Leader.' It was all about him,"" Hipwell said. ""Nothing that happened on that desk happened without Piers knowing about it,"" Hipwell said of the show business desk. A lawyer for Trinity Mirror, which publishes the Mirror, said the company disputed Hipwell's testimony and would go into more detail at a future session of the inquiry. In the past, Morgan has vigorously denied ordering phone hacking at any point during his career. He struck pre-emptively at Hipwell on Tuesday, pointing out that the journalist had gone to prison over a stock tip scandal and saying he would not be a reliable witness. Morgan was investigated over the stock tip scandal but not charged or convicted of any crime. Also on Tuesday, Jay, the inquiry lawyer, repeatedly tried to use Morgan's own words against him to show he knew more about hacking than he admitted, citing his books and interviews in print and on the radio. Morgan, at times clipped and at times testy, deflected line after line of inquiry, saying the quotes did not mean what Jay implied they did. The Leveson Inquiry was prompted by public and political outrage at the revelation that another tabloid, Rupert Murdoch's News of the World, hacked into the phone of a missing teenage girl who later turned out to have been murdered. Murdoch's son James ordered the best-selling paper closed over the scandal. Much of the inquiry -- and a related police investigation -- focus on allegations of phone hacking by the News of the World. The publisher of the paper, News International, announced Tuesday that a subsidiary had settled with seven people who accused Murdoch's newspapers of phone hacking. The claimants included James Hewitt, who was a lover of Diana, Princess of Wales, and other British celebrities. The newspaper group ""has agreed to pay appropriate sums by way of compensation and costs and have expressed regret for the distress caused,"" News International said in a statement. The company settled earlier this year with ""G.I. Joe"" actress Sienna Miller and a handful of other claimants, but other lawsuits against the newspaper group are outstanding. Testimony by former staff of News of the World and News International last week focused on how much News International chief executive James Murdoch knew about hacking by his employees. Police say notebooks seized from a private investigator working for News of the World contain the names of about 5,800 potential victims of phone hacking. The process involves calling a cell phone and entering a personal identification number to access voice messages. CNN's James Partington contributed to this report.","A former Piers Morgan employee says he must have known about hacking .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor years ago said she was a ""product of affirmative action"" when she was admitted to prestigious universities, but defended the contributions she offered as a Hispanic woman to classroom and workplace diversity. ""I am the perfect affirmative action baby,"" Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor said in the 1990s. The statements were part of newly released videos of speeches and panel discussions dating from the mid-1980s that the 54-year-old federal judge provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will begin confirmation hearings July 13. The remarks offer often-candid insights into the New York native's views on the law, growing up poor in a Bronx housing project, juggling a career and a social life, and her 1980s divorce. In an early 1990s panel with two other female judges, Sotomayor talked about her educational background and how it helped her in her job as a federal trial judge in Manhattan. ""I am a product of affirmative action,"" she said. ""I am the perfect affirmative action baby. I am Puerto Rican, born and raised in the south Bronx. My test scores were not comparable to my colleagues at Princeton and Yale. Not so far off so that I wasn't able to succeed at those institutions."" She said that using ""traditional numbers"" from test scores, ""it would have been highly questionable if I would have been accepted."" The female panel members politely objected to her characterizations of how she overcame such obstacles, pointing out she graduated from law school with honors and was on the prestigious law review. Sotomayor countered that those were signs test scores alone do not offer the full measure of a person's capability. Test scores, she said, often can be the result of ""cultural biases."" In a 1986 interview with ABC News profiling young female professionals, Sotomayor said she constantly had to deal with subtle forms of discrimination, particularly when it came to public perceptions. ""I found in my experiences that it's not that men are consciously discriminating against promoting women, but I do believe as people we have self-images about what's good,"" she said. ""What's quote-unquote a 'good' lawyer, doctor, or whatever the profession is. And if you're a male who grew up professionally in a male-dominated profession then your image of what a good lawyer is is a male image."" Years later on the federal bench, Sotomayor said she encountered similar treatment from older white men particularly, who seemed to speak longer to her than other lawyers. She said the impression she got was that was because she was a woman and a minority. Sotomayor has been criticized by some conservatives for her remarks on diversity, and her 2001 comment that she ""would hope that a wise Latina woman, with the richness of her experiences, would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" In the legal panel, she rejected suggestions that minorities should accept ""selection by merit alone."" She noted, ""It is critical that we promote diversity"" by giving women and minorities more opportunities in the law and the judiciary. ""Since I have difficulty defining merit and what merit alone means -- and in any context, whether it's judicial or otherwise -- I accept that different experiences in and of itself, bring merit to the system,"" she said. ""I think it brings to the system more of a sense of fairness when these litigants see people like myself on the bench."" As a judge she offered a variety of thoughts on how a judge should act on the bench. ""I have to unhook myself from my emotional responses and try to stay within my unemotional objective persona,"" she told a group of Hispanic lawyers in 2000. She said in 1994 that such an attitude can be hard to maintain, when as a trial judge she had to deal with some defendants and their families. ""I watch those mothers cry and I can't help but feel their pain. Does that translate into a passion or compassion that affects my judgment? No, but it makes it much more important for me to be careful when I exercise my judgment."" In another panel she noted that she sometimes spoke to some defendants and their families in Spanish in civil cases, to keep them informed of what she was doing. She said she made sure to translate what she was saying into English. In several events she said the life of a lawyer is rarely glamorous. In a 1986 interview she admitted her divorce was caused in part by her commitment to her career, and that her subsequent social life had suffered as a result. And as she grew into her 30s, she lamented her earlier expectations had to that point not been fully realized. ""I'm very happy with where I am at this point in my life but I think my expectations were greater in '76,"" when she graduated from Princeton. ""I mean, I really expected to turn the world on fire.""","Remarks from an early 1990s panel with two other female judges .

"(CNN) -- Svetlana Kuznetsova drew on her vast experience to keep Russia in contention for a fifth Fed Cup tennis title in the final against the Czech Republic on Saturday. The 26-year-old, who featured in three of her nation's four winning line-ups between 2004 and 2008, helped Russia end the first day on level terms in Moscow after world No. 2 Petra Kvitova continued her remarkable year. Kvitova, who last weekend added the season-ending WTA Championships title to her July Wimbledon crown, gave the visiting Czechs a 1-0 lead when she beat Maria Kirilenko 6-2 6-2 in the opening singles rubber. Kuznetsova lost both of her singles matches in the 2004 final, a 3-2 win over France sealed in the deciding doubles tie, but was undefeated in four finals outings in 2007-08. The former U.S. Open and French Open champion continued that winning run as she beat Lucie Safarova 6-2 6-3. ""I felt colossal pressure. But if I was playing that rubber in the year 2004, I think I would feel really tight and jittery,"" she told the Fed Cup website. ""Now I have more expertise, and that expertise helped me to motivate myself and to motivate myself in the right direction."" Kuznetsova, ranked 19th, will take on the 21-year-old Kvitova in Sunday's opening reverse singles rubber in their first career meeting. Kirilenko has a 4-1 career record over Safarova, but they have not met since 2009.

"Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- A convicted computer hacker from California testified Tuesday in Pfc. Bradley Manning's preliminary hearing about six days of chats he conducted with someone who claimed to have leaked classified information and was ""looking to brag about what they had done."" Adrian Lamo said he traded instant messages in a chat format with someone self-identified as Bradass87. Lamo testified that based on an e-mail he received from Manning, as well as an examination of Manning's Facebook page, that Bradass87 was Manning. The testimony came on the fifth day of the preliminary hearing, which will determine if Manning proceeds to a full military court-martial. Manning is accused of stealing and leaking more than a quarter of a million classified documents from the State Department and the Defense Department to the WikiLeaks website, the biggest intelligence leak in U.S. history. Army Criminal Investigation Command Special Agent David Shaver later testified that the chat logs that Lamo provided to the Army largely matched chat logs found on Manning's computer in Iraq. The prosecution did not ask Lamo any specific questions about the chats themselves, but did establish that he was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and takes medication for it. At one point he admitted overusing his medication to the point that his parents became concerned and he eventually was put in an involuntary psychiatric hold for three days. The only possible signs of his medical condition evident in court was his often halting speech and his unusual turn of a phrase. For example, when the prosecutor swore him in and then said ""you make take your seat,"" Lamo responded, ""That I shall."" When the defense cross-examined Lamo, he read portions of the chat logs that seemed to indicate that he was not being completely forthcoming with Manning about why he wanted to know details about the leaks. At one point Lamo wrote, ""I'm a journalist and a minister. You can pick either, and treat this as a confession or an interview (never to be published) & enjoy a modicum of legal protection."" But Lamo, within a month, had given the chat logs to both Army investigators and Wired magazine. Before Lamo took the stand, another Army Criminal Investigation Command special agent, Antonio Edwards, testified that Lamo was a confidential informant for the command but was not paid for information. He was reimbursed for normal expenses. At one point Manning's lead attorney, David Coombs, implied Lamo was asking Manning questions to get him to reveal how he planned to release classified information. Coombs asked Lamo why he wanted to know, and Lamo replied that he ""asked out of curiosity, I am a curious individual. Which has been amply evidenced by my actions."" Because of Lamo's habit of answering yes or no questions with long responses, the cross-examination sometimes got contentious, but not to the point of anyone getting angry or raising their voice. Near the end, Coombs had to repeatedly ask a question regarding why someone might want to communicate with a minister. Finally both the investigating officer and the prosecutor made suggestions about how Coombs might better phrase the question. It worked. Lamo answered without further problems. By 3:30 Tuesday afternoon, the prosecution said it was finished presenting witnesses. Coombs plans to call three witnesses starting Wednesday morning. Testimony on Thursday began with Jihrleah Showman, who was Manning's team leader in the secure computer room in Iraq, as well as earlier, when they were at Fort Drum in New York. She told of incidents of erratic behavior on the part of Manning that led her to report that she felt Manning shouldn't be handling classified information. The Army private faces 22 charges, including aiding the enemy. He's accused of stealing and leaking the cables while serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2009 and 2010. If convicted on all counts, he could face the death penalty. However, Army prosecutors have signaled they will not recommend death in the event of a conviction, and it is unlikely they would be overruled by a senior officer.

"Paris (CNN) -- President Malam Bacai Sanha of Guinea-Bissau died early Monday, according to an official at the West African nation's embassy in Paris. He was 64. The official said Sanha was in Paris for treatment, and died at Val-de-Grace Hospital. Sanha became president in September 2009, months after the assassination of President Joao Bernardo Vieira. Sanha had served as interim president and defeated another former president, Kumba Yala, in a runoff election. Guinea-Bissau's history has been marked by military coups and attempted coups since the nation of 1.5 million gained independence from Portugal in 1974. Those conflicts ravaged the nation's infrastructure and economy and left it among the poorest in the world. Despite Sanha's coming to power in what international observers deemed a fair and peaceful election, his tenure was marked by turmoil among the country's military and political leadership. Last month, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the use of violence in what was suspected to be a military coup attempt, saying in a statement, ""The primacy of the lawful civilian authorities according to the constitution must be respected."" And, despite the Parliament's call to fight drug trafficking, Guinea-Bissau is still considered an increasingly important transit point for cocaine en route from South America to Europe, according to the CIA Factbook.","President Malam Bacai Sanha died at Val-de-Grace Hospital in Paris on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Two-time champions Nigeria failed to qualify for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations after being held 2-2 by Guinea on Saturday. Second-half goals from strikers Victor Obinna and Ikechukwu Uche put Nigeria 2-1 ahead in Abuja, but Ibrahima Traore's 90th-minute equalizer ensured that Guinea finished top of Group B by three points. The Super Eagles missed out on one of the runner-up spots as two of their three wins came against bottom nation Madagascar -- and only results against the top and third-placed teams count. Nigeria won the tournament in 1980 and 1994, and finished third in four of the last five stagings. South Africa, champions in 1996, also failed to qualify for next year's event in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon after being held 0-0 at home by Sierra Leone. Niger went through from Group G instead on head-to-head results despite losing 3-0 in Egypt, after both nations finished on nine points. Ghana, runners-up in 2010, qualified in first place from Group I after a 2-0 win away to Sudan thanks to first-half goals from striker Asamoah Gyan and defender John Mensah.

"Washington (CNN) -- While international sanctions continue to mount against Iran and its nuclear program, the Obama administration acknowledged Tuesday that the steps have done little to change Iran's behavior. National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said at a conference at the Brookings Institution that Iran is paying a steep price for its intransigence. Growing international sanctions, diplomatic isolation and growing defense alliances in the region continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran and have helped slow its nuclear efforts. But Donilon also admitted that ""the Iranian regime has not fundamentally altered its behavior."" This month, the International Atomic Energy Agency questioned whether Iran's nuclear program is for peaceful energy purposes, as Iran maintains. In the most detailed report to date, the IAEA found ""credible"" information that Tehran has carried out work toward nuclear weapons, including tests of possible bomb components. Despite Iran's failure to change its behavior, Donilon thinks the United States, working in concert with its international partners, will eventually have an impact on the Iranian leadership if they remain persistent and unified. ""We think it has an effect when they see that they are thoroughly isolated,"" Donilon said. But unity has been a problem. China and Russia in particular have been reluctant to support harsher sanctions against Iran and have effectively forced the United States and European nations to settle for less punishing measures. However, Donilon maintained that there is good coordination and cooperation with China and Russia. ""They have supported us on each of our sanctions, international sanctions at the U.N.,"" he said. ""They have enforced those efforts faithfully."" Donilon said it is important all options remain on the table. ""Over time, the goal, of course, would be to raise the price and force the choice,"" he added.","National security adviser says Iran is paying for intransigence .

"Laguna Niguel, California (CNN) -- Apple's ambition to improve the fidelity of music downloads has diminished since the death of founder Steve Jobs, according to singer-songwriter Neil Young. Apple consulted with the influential musician, along with many others in the music industry, for a project to develop electronics and distribution channels for high-definition music, Young said in an onstage interview at News Corp.'s D: Dive Into Media conference Tuesday. CNN first reported a year ago that Apple, along with other digital music retailers, were talking with executives in the record industry about selling high-fidelity tracks in iTunes and retooling iPods to be compatible with them. Most music downloads are currently sold in either the MP3 or AAC formats, both of which compress sound in order to produce smaller files. Jobs was personally involved in the high-def initiative, speaking directly to Young about it, the 66-year-old musician recalled. Improving the quality of digital music is a personal mission for Young, who has evangelized for it before. ""Steve Jobs was a pioneer of digital music,"" Young said. ""But when he went home, he listened to vinyl."" However, ""not much"" has happened with Apple's high-def gadgets and downloads project since Jobs died in October, Young said. Jobs was a voracious consumer of music, with a special passion for the Beatles and Bob Dylan. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. ""My goal is to rescue the art form that I've been practicing for about 50 years,"" said Young, whose Rock and Roll Hall of Fame career spans six decades, from Buffalo Springfield to his rich solo career to his work with Pearl Jam and beyond. ""The problem is that there's no alternative."" Industry-standard MP3 files have only about 5% of all the sounds that were contained in the original recording, which is called a ""master."" Because high-def music files are significantly larger, Young described a system that would allow the device to download it while the user is asleep. Despite the availability of high-quality music sold by niche e-commerce websites, consumers so far have expressed little interest. Many musicians are embracing the idea of giving fans pristine recordings, often at a premium price. The Rolling Stones issued their first 27 records to one such store. Record companies may like the idea of being able to repackage old albums at a higher price, but they surely weren't on board with all of Young's ideas. In the interview Tuesday, Young embraced illegal music downloads. ""Piracy is the new radio,"" said Young, whose music has long had a rebellious streak. ""I look at the Internet as the new radio. I look at the radio as gone.""","Singer-songwriter Neil Young: ""Steve Jobs was a pioneer of digital music""

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday the appointment of the first woman parliamentarian in the chamber since that position was created in the 1930s. Elizabeth MacDonough will replace retiring parliamentarian Alan Frumin. MacDonough currently serves as one of Frumin's top deputies. The parliamentarian is the Senate's official -- and non-partisan -- umpire, calling balls and strikes on how the arcane rules of the chamber apply to the often rough and tumble day-to-day debates. Frumin, who was the chief parliamentarian for the last 18 years, was ""impartial to a fault,"" boasted Reid, D-Nevada. That explains why he is the only person appointed to the job by both Democratic and Republican majority leaders, Reid explained. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky praised Frumin's smarts and his devotion to the Senate. The soft-spoken and bookish Frumin gained Washington celebrity status in 2010 when he had to make a number of high-profile rulings related to the Senate's handling of President Barack Obama's health care bill. He was ""one of the most talked about men in Washington,"" Reid said. ""Despite the pressure and despite the national spotlight, Mr. Frumin remained calm and professional through what must have been one of the most intense moments of his career."" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, praised MacDonough for her ""professionalism"" and for setting a precedent by being the first woman to hold the position. ""We all look forward to working with you, even when you give us disappointing ruling,"" he told her with a smile.","MacDonough will replace Alan Frumin, who was parliamentarian for 18 years .

"(CNN) -- It should be time to celebrate key milestones in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Recently, the United Nations announced that new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths fell to their lowest levels since the epidemic's peak. Today, 6.6 million people in low- and middle-income countries are on life-saving antiretroviral therapy, and people with HIV are living longer. These gains are significant. But because of the shortsightedness of many wealthy countries, we are once again at risk of losing an opportunity to contain and control this deadly epidemic. The announcement by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) of these gains was quickly followed by much more sobering news. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria -- the main financier of HIV programs around the world -- reported deep funding shortfalls as Western countries shrink or skip their promised Global Fund payments. The Global Fund is freezing expenditures for existing HIV treatment programs and removing hundreds of millions in funding for new programs. The result? Fewer people on HIV treatment, more HIV, more AIDS, more orphans, more misery, more death. The world has been on the cusp of a promising new era in combating HIV before. At the 2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, the globe's most powerful economies committed to fund universal access to HIV prevention, treatment and care by 2010. The global community fell short by half. Because of that, there were millions of new -- preventable -- HIV infections, with widespread morbidity and mortality and massive economic and social costs. Tragically, the HIV pandemic continued to expand. Earlier this year, at the U.N., the same players renewed their pledge to fund universal access by 2015. Yet we now hear news of shrinking resources in the face of massive need. Let's be clear -- the United States is a leader in funding the fight against HIV. Since then-President George W. Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) launched in 2003, U.S. support has provided millions of HIV-infected people with access to antiretroviral therapy. Today, the U.S. commitment remains strong, through the Obama administration's National HIV/AIDS StrategyÂ in America and Global Health Initiative, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's recent call for an AIDS-free generation. Clinton's goal hinges on a handful of key initiatives, including the immediate expansion of a program known as ""treatment as prevention"" and a corresponding increase in funding for the Global Fund. Treatment as prevention, which calls for widespread testing for HIV and treatment for those testing positive, was pioneered at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS in British Columbia, Canada. Effective treatment of a person living with HIV puts the virus into virtual long-term remission and dramatically reduces its transmission, preventing further infections. Leading global health organizations such as the International AIDS Society, UNAIDS and the Clinton Foundation support the expansion of ""treatment as prevention"" programs worldwide, calling the preventive benefit of treatment a ""game-changer"" in the fight against HIV. Further compelling evidence that treatment as prevention works was provided by a U.S. clinical trial (HPTN052) in May 2011. It found that immediate antiretroviral treatment of an HIV-infected person whose partner does not have HIV reduced AIDS-related morbidity and mortality in the HIV-infected partner by 41% and decreased HIV transmission to the sexual partner by 96%. Together, these results were instrumental in persuading the international community to renew the universal access pledge. UNAIDS says that 12.2 million new HIV infections and 7.4 million HIV-related deaths could be averted between 2011 and 2020 if funding is scaled up to $24 billion annually by 2015. The dollars required are considerable, but -- considering that the G8 pledged $40 billion virtually on the spot for the Arab Spring -- fully affordable. Funding universal access is not just a moral and ethical obligation; it is also highly cost-effective. China gets it. The world's most populous country is implementing a national treatment as prevention strategy to help China meet its goal of bringing HIV and AIDS under control by 2015. Under its program, China conducted nearly 67 million HIV tests in the first 10 months of this year. The global effort to combat HIV cannot afford further delays, as the magnitude and impact of the pandemic grow relentlessly. Today, 34 million people live with HIV and 7.6 million people require treatment. We continue to play catch-up. For every one person who starts HIV treatment, two become infected with HIV. It is time to fully fund the Global Fund, so we can meet the universal access pledge and realize the goal of an AIDS-free generation. Millions of lives depend on it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julio Montaner.","Julio Monanter: UNAIDS announces HIV infections, AIDS deaths down from peak .
Montaner: But these gains are threatened as West fails to meet funding obligations .
Global Fund to fight AIDS has deep shortfalls, he writes, is cutting new programs .

"(CNN) -- Yemeni officials on Tuesday downplayed rumors that next month's presidential elections in Yemen would be delayed, the same day U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton faulted the Yemeni president for failing to fulfill his commitment to leave the country. Any delay in the elections are unacceptable by all standards, senior officials in Vice President Abdurabu Hadi's office said. The statement comes after Yemen's foreign minister hinted that presidential elections could be delayed due to the rising tension in the country. ""I am among those who hope that (the presidential election) will take place in the planned manner,"" Abubakr al-Qirbi said in an interview on al-Arabiya TV on Tuesday. ""But unfortunately, there are a couple of events relating to security, and if they are not solved ... it will be difficult to run the elections on February 21."" Hadi's office called Qirbi's comments unnecessary. Yahya al-Arasi, media officer for the vice president, told CNN that elections are essential for Yemen and the vice president has no plans to delay elections under any circumstance. ""It's unrealistic and unacceptable to delay the presidential elections,"" al-Arasi said. He added, ""If elections are delayed, Yemen will again start from step one, and the unexpected would take place."" CNN contacted Qirbi's office and they assured that his comments come independently and not in favor of any certain political faction in the country. Hadi is expected to win the country's February 21 elections. Qirbi's announcement also raised fears within opposition groups that President Ali Abdullah Saleh is again using tactics to stay in power. Under the terms of a Gulf Cooperation Council-brokered deal, Saleh has agreed to step down as president on February 21 in exchange for immunity from prosecution. ""We regret that the president has thus far failed to comply with his own commitments to leave the country and to permit elections to go forward, that could give the people a chance to be heard and be represented,"" Secretary of State Clinton told reporters. Speaking in the Ivory Coast, she also addressed why what happens in Yemen is significant to regional stability. ""We remain focused on the threat posed by al Qaeda in Yemen, and we'll continue to work with our partners there and elsewhere to ensure that al Qaeda does not gain a foothold in the Arabian Peninsula through actions that would undermine the stability of Yemen and the region,"" she said. Meanwhile, Mohammed Abu Lahoum, president of the opposition Justice and Building party said any call for delaying the elections is unwise. He said that delaying the presidential elections would only deepen the Yemeni crisis. ""Delaying the presidential elections is completely against the GCC power transfer and will delay any sort of stability to Yemen,"" said Abu Lahoum. Analysts are worried that Saleh is seeking to delay the elections to buy him more time in power. ""The GCC power transfer signing was delayed six times in 2011, and Saleh benefited the most from the delays. For Saleh, it's never really over,"" said Ali Abdul Jabbar, director of the Sana'a based Dar Ashraf Reaserch Center. Abdul Jabbar said that Saleh was hoping to control Yemen indirectly after stepping down from power, but the tension between him and Hadi made that impossible. ""Saleh will do all that in his power to derail the elections for as long as he can. He has everything to lose,"" he said. The U.N.-backed power transition plan was signed in November and designed after more than a year of political and economic unrest. The election planned for net month will put an end to Saleh's 33 years in power.","NEW: Clinton says the Yemeni president has ""failed to comply with his own commitments""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A spokesman for the Taliban denied on Wednesday a weekend report that Taliban representatives may meet with officials representing the government of President Hamid Karzai in Saudi Arabia in the coming weeks. ""There is no doubt that Saudi Arabia is a respectful country for us as it is the place for the house of God and many more Islamic sacred, but the rumor which has recently been spread by media that the Taliban delegation would meet with Karzai administrationÂ¹s representatives in the Saudi Arabia is completely incorrect,"" said spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid in a statement. He added that the Taliban are working to create an understanding with the international community, but negotiations have not begun. That's because a trust-building stage, which must come before any negotiations, has not been completed, he said. He called the reports ""baseless and unconfirmed."" The statement came several days after a senior Afghan official said that the Afghan government was hoping to hold talks with Taliban representatives in Saudi Arabia in the coming weeks. The senior official, speaking anonymously as he was discussing sensitive diplomatic issues, said the plans for a meeting between insurgents and Afghan officials were at such an early stage that it was not clear who would attend or when any talks would be held. ""The principle is that, although there is now an agreement -- almost -- to set up an office in Doha (Qatar), that doesn't necessarily mean that all conversations will take place in Doha,"" the official said. ""We will talk to the same or different individuals (from the insurgency) in a different location. Obviously, Saudi Arabia has been supportive of the recent agenda and has hosted talks in the past. It is likely that we are heading there in the future for meetings."" He said the dates and participants were still being worked out and insisted that any Saudi discussions would feed into the Qatar process. This is ""absolutely not in opposition to the Qatar process,"" he added, calling the talks in that Gulf state ""a very substantive step forward."" While the Afghan official was unable to say whether the Americans would attend any talks held in Saudi Arabia, he insisted, ""The U.S. is supportive of the idea. It is far too early to discuss any specifics about this."" The creation of a parallel process to the Qatar talks risks frustrating American efforts to bring the Taliban and Afghan officials together. The current ""talks about talks"" in Doha are the product of months of U.S. efforts to reach out to the insurgency, which came to sudden fruition last month when the Taliban announced that they would support opening an office in their name in Qatar. Officials in President Hamid Karzai's government privately voiced frustration at being excluded from the early stages of this process, but agreed to support it last week. The official said the Qatar process could move forward once the Qataris send a delegation to Kabul to discuss the next steps, adding that he hoped that would be soon. He said that, as of last weekend, there were no Afghan government officials in Qatar to support any discussions. ""To fully assume ownership of the Qatar process is important for us,"" the official added. ""We will work in the weeks ahead"" to do that. He said the Americans needed a clear statement from the insurgents, distancing themselves from terrorism, for their role in the Qatar process to move forward and for an office to be established. ""We know and are aware the are Taliban representatives in Doha,"" he said. ""There are channels in fact, and we are aware of the presence. What's not yet established is the office."" CNN's Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.","Taliban spokesman says any negotiations must be preceded by a trust-building stage .

"Washington (CNN) -- A 21-month investigation into allegations that the Federal Air Marshal Service has a hostile work environment -- rife with discrimination and retaliation -- has concluded that no ""widespread"" problem exists, according to an internal government e-mail obtained by CNN. But, investigators also concluded, a large number of air marshals think those problems exist. The e-mail is the first glimpse into the long-awaited investigative report, which is scheduled to be released to the public on February 9. Whistle-blowers in the air marshal's Orlando, Florida, field office triggered the investigation in early 2010 when they alleged that supervisors used a ""Jeopardy!""-style whiteboard to demean and ridicule rank-and-file officers. The board contained derogatory terms to allude to gays, lesbians and African-Americans, they said. But the investigation grew to include other field offices and other accusations, and the Department of Homeland Security's internal e-mail Tuesday said Office of Inspector General investigators have interviewed more than 300 DHS employees. While investigators have remained silent about their work, air marshals contacted by CNN say they provided evidence of a wide range of misconduct, including a supervisor who ran a private security business while at work, supervisors who perjured themselves in sworn testimony against subordinates, and instances of favoritism, racism, sexism and discrimination. A Federal Air Marshal Service spokeswoman declined to comment on the pending report and government e-mail Tuesday. But several air marshals said they are eager to read the report, and say they will dispute any conclusion that discrimination and retaliation are not widespread. ""We're going to tear the report apart,"" one air marshal, who asked not to be identified, said Tuesday. ""We're going to take and review the report and we're going to look at our conclusions, because we know what we gave them."" The internal DHS e-mail summarizes the report's findings. ""The (OIG) concluded that there was no widespread discrimination or retaliation within (the Federal Air Marshal Service),"" it says. ""However, the report does suggest that a large segment of our workforce feels that retaliation and discrimination exists."" Supervisors have a responsibility to ""dispel"" the perception that the service is rife with discrimination and retaliation, it continues. In addition to the normal investigative techniques, the OIG took the unusual step of surveying the air marshal workforce. The survey asked air marshals if favoritism ever played a role in promotions, job evaluations and mission assignments; whether air marshals have ever been discriminated against or harassed on the job; and whether they feel they can report misconduct without fear of retaliation. In August 2011, the Department of Homeland Security declined a CNN Freedom of Information Act request for the survey results, saying that the documents involved an ongoing investigation. It also said the results could reveal the total number of air marshals, which is classified. A House committee has scheduled a hearing on the air marshals on Feb. 16.","CNN obtained an internal DHS e-mail about a probe of the Federal Air Marshal Service .

"(CNN) -- As Florida Republican operatives look past Tuesday's primary, they are clear about what it will take to carry their state in November -- winning swing voters. While the 2012 GOP presidential race has sometimes seemed like a competition among the Republican White House hopefuls over who can appeal to the party's hard core, the fall campaign will be about winning the middle, according to a CNN survey of 47 Florida GOP insiders -- state legislators, political consultants, fundraisers, veterans of previous primary campaigns, tea party advocates and a variety of other party activists. Which do you think is relatively more important to winning Florida in the general election? Having a nominee who can win swing voters: 83% . Having a nominee who excites the conservative base: 13% . Both (volunteered): 4% . That overwhelming verdict comes in part because of the belief that conservatives will show up at the polls just to vote against the incumbent, President Barack Obama, even if they're not thrilled with the GOP nominee. ""Swing is key,"" said one Florida GOP insider. ""The base will be motivated anyway."" Echoed another: ""Conservatives will be there regardless."" CNN Florida Insiders Survey: 'Romney stepping up his game' Another key voting bloc in Florida in the general election will be Hispanic and Latino voters. The GOP insiders thought that Mitt Romney would be their best bet in the fall. Who do you think would have the strongest appeal to Hispanic and Latino voters in the general election? Mitt Romney: 64% . Newt Gingrich: 33% . Rich Santorum: 1% . When the Florida insiders were asked how easy it would be to get behind a prospective nominee, only one candidate among the remaining contenders seems to face a severe enthusiasm deficit when it comes to the fall campaign -- Texas Rep. Ron Paul. His isolationist views on national security are anathema to many Republicans, and his libertarian bent can also cause some concerns among social conservatives. Would you have a hard time enthusiastically supporting any of these candidates if he was the nominee? Ron Paul: 71% . Newt Gingrich: 28% . Rick Santorum: 24% . Mitt Romney: 9% . ""Ron Paul is Ron Paul, but Newt simply doesn't fit the profile of a winning GOP candidate in Florida,"" said one party insider who is unaffiliated with any of the campaigns. ""You have to be able to excite the conservative base and not turn off swing voters. Swing voters (would) flee from Newt faster than that golf ball his by Alan Shepard took off on the moon."" Polls that currently show Romney with the best chance to defeat Obama are one of the reasons why the former Massachusetts governor is a favorite among the party establishment. ""I'd have a hard time supporting anyone other than Romney because I know none of the others can beat Obama,"" said one Florida GOP insider. Still, another Florida GOP insider lamented, ""I think this is the weakest field we have ever put forth in my lifetime. The CNN Florida insiders were surveyed from Thursday afternoon through Saturday. The survey was conducted over the Internet. The Florida insiders were given anonymity for their individual answers to encourage candid responses. Just under half of the insiders said they were formally aligned with one of the presidential campaigns, and half said they had neither endorsed any candidate nor were they working for one. Overall, one-third of the insiders backed Romney, while just under one-sixth supported Gingrich. If only the responses from insiders currently unaligned with any of the candidates were tabulated, the results predicted the primary vote would be Romney 39%, Gingrich 32%, Santorum 15%, Paul 10%, and other 2%.

"(CNN) -- A school system in upstate New York, where more than a dozen female high school students are suffering from uncontrolled verbal outbursts and twitching, said it has hired a company to review environmental testing within the school and community. The development comes as famed activist Erin Brockovich and other environmentalists are looking into whether a chemical that spilled in a 1970 train derailment about four miles from the school has anything to do with the girls' mysterious behavior. One of Brockovich's associates walked the grounds of Le Roy Senior High School on Saturday and traveled to the derailment site. The Le Roy Central School District said it wanted ""sound advice"" from professionals on the situation, ""void of self-interest."" ""Our community has suddenly found itself at the center of national attention due to the students who have been exhibiting neurological symptoms,"" Superintendent Kim M. Cox said in a statement released Friday. ""This has led to much speculation, conjecture and misinformation in the national media and consequently within our community."" Cox said the school district is working with local, state and federal health and environmental agencies. A statement posted earlier on the school's website said, in part, ""The medical and environmental investigations have not uncovered any evidence that would link the neurological symptoms to anything in the environment or of an infectious nature."" The school district posted air quality and mold reports on its website. ""Water was also ruled out because the school is serviced by public water,"" it said. The mother of one affected girl said she doesn't think enough testing has been done. Health officials say the girls' symptoms are consistent with ""conversion disorder."" Brockovich told HLN's ""Dr. Drew"" on Friday night that she will try to corroborate a note she said one of the affected family members received about the derailment. ""The contaminated rock, fill and soil was used to build the new school,"" Brockovich said of the note. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, one ton of cyanide crystals spilled onto the ground in the December 6, 1970, derailment. About 30,000 gallons of trichloroethene (TCE), a potentially harmful contaminant, also were released from two ruptured tank cars, the agency said. ""I have read and been involved in cases that we have had that TCE can be associated with neurological disorders,"" Brockovich told HLN. The first significant cleanup and remediation did not start for 20 years, she said, adding she was worried about the chemical getting into bedrock and groundwater supplies. The TCE may have reached the school grounds, she said. The EPA's Superfund website provides a progress report of the cleanup done in the area over the past 20 years. ""Drinking wells in the area were found to have TCE contamination,"" the EPA said. ""Sampling of private wells between 1990 and 1994 detected TCE in approximately 50 wells located east or southeast of the site."" The EPA installed water-treatment systems at 37 locations where TCE levels were high. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation used soil vapor extraction and bedrock vapor extraction to address the source of the contamination. ""A water-line extension was selected to provide a safe, potable water supply to all affected residents and businesses,"" the EPA said. Robert Bowcock, an environmental water specialist associated with Brockovich, went to the derailment site Saturday and took water samples to test for contaminants. He also took water samples from wells at private residences. An HLN producer saw several dozen drums in a fenced-off area at the derailment site, but it was not clear what they may contain. One was rusted and had dirt-like material inside. Brockovich gained fame after the 2000 movie bearing her name and starring Julia Roberts in the title role. It told the story of how she, as a file clerk at a law firm, established that a toxic chemical from a compressor station leaked into the groundwater of a nearby California town, according to a biography posted on Brockovich's website. Medical experts, meanwhile, continue to investigate the girls' symptoms, which in some cases, include stuttering. Dr. Jennifer McVige, a pediatric neurologist at the DENT Neurologic Institute who is treating many of the students affected, said, ""Conversion disorder is a physical manifestation of physiological symptoms where there is traditionally some kind of stress or multiple stressors that provoke a physical reaction within the body."" McVige said the symptoms are real. ""This is unconscious. It is not done purposefully."" Thera Sanchez, a senior on the honor roll at the school, said she has been fighting this affliction since October. She said after waking up from a nap, ""I got upset, I couldn't stop stuttering."" During an interview with CNN's Jason Carroll, Thera's symptoms were apparent: She was twitching uncontrollably, flailing her left arm and jerking her head to one side. Thera said she also faints and has seizures. The seizures are a result of her pre-existing epilepsy disorder, which had been under control for years. ""I don't think that all physical aspects of this have been exhausted; not enough testing has been done,"" Thera's mother, Melissa Phillips, said. She also disagreed with McVige's assertion that the girls are improving, saying, ""Nothing is getting better, you know, the girls are still getting worse. They have good days and bad days."" McVige is not sure why so many girls at the same school are suffering all at once. ""I do know that traditionally when they've (doctors) looked back at different events that occurred in a similar nature, a majority of the time it is girls."" According to the Mayo Clinic, females are much more likely to get conversion disorder and it is more common in adolescents or young adults. McVige said she used the ""diagnosis of exclusion"" to determine what happened to the girls, which means using the process of elimination. She ruled out a laundry list of factors to reach her diagnosis, including infections, drug use, food allergies and vaccine reactions, specifically Gardasil. The New York State Health Department agreed with McVige's diagnosis after speaking with several doctors who evaluated the students. ""There are many causes of tic-like symptoms. Stress can often worsen them,"" said spokesman Jeffrey Hammond. ""The doctors all agree that the symptoms these girls are experiencing are real."" HLN's Liz Flynn reported from Le Roy, New York. CNN's Danielle Dellorto, Laura Dolan, Maggie Schneider and Jason Carroll also contributed to this report.","School will review environmental tests in the area .

Or sweet potato casserole and pecan pie. Cranberries. Collard greens. Stuffing. Every year, we spend hours making the traditional Thanksgiving favorites just like our mom used to do, like her mom did before that. ""When you do something repeatedly over the years, it builds up a kind of power,"" nutritional psychologist Marc David says. ""It creates its own momentum. To make the same dish year after year, decade after decade, there's something in that that connects us to the past."" Nostalgia comes from the Greek word for homecoming (nostos) and pain (algos). But experts say feeling nostalgic is actually good for your mental health. Anything can bring on that special moment -- music, smells, photos. We play the same songs, cook the same recipes, take the same family photo in the same spot next to the same fireplace because we're human, David says. Our biological functions are based on repetitive rhythms. Our brains are hardwired to relax when surrounded by the familiar. ""Emotional eating has gotten a bad name,"" David says. ""We're emotional people. We are emotional beings. We're built for pleasure."" Nostalgic products fill a need to belong and feel socially connected, according to an Arizona State University study published in the Journal of Consumer Research last year. That's why this time of year, TV and radio ads are filled with smiling families sitting around a large table in holiday sweaters, passing the dinner rolls. Even if you're far away from home, companies want you to believe that buying those same dinner rolls will fill your heart with holiday joy. Turns out, it works. Dr. Clay Routledge works with other researchers from the University of Southampton's nostalgia project. He recently published an article in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology titled ""The past makes present meaningful."" Nostalgia, Routledge found, increases a person's self-esteem. Daily activities like going to class or attending meetings are routine, even boring. When we engage in nostalgia, we tend to think of the things that are really important to us. That makes us feel like our life is meaningful. Taste of Home's sweet potato tart recipe . ""What's amazing about autobiographical memory is that bad memories fade faster than positive memories,"" Routledge says. ""One thing that's interesting about nostalgia is that it's not 100% detail accurate -- it's more the highlights."" Nostalgia is largely social. Routledge' s studies found that people who are alone or disconnected feel better after engaging in nostalgia. Yet you're probably dreaming right now about your grandfather's deep-fried turkey, not about him, right? ""Is it really about the food?"" Routledge asks. ""Or is the food just sort of a trigger or cue for what the holidays are really all about, which is relationships. We don't eat these foods other times of the year because we've segmented them off as special. They go with this occasion. They go with the relationships."" For Taste of Home editor Catherine Cassidy, Thanksgiving means cooking for the ones she loves. She gets satisfaction in putting good food on the table for her family. So many of our best moments from the past, she says, are rooted in our sense of smell. ""We call them food memories. When it comes to the holidays we are always trying to recreate the magic and the specialness we experienced when we were children."" So indulge in a little Thanksgiving daydream. Long for the oyster stuffing. Sniff the air in anticipation of mom's pumpkin pie. Then on the big day, enjoy your holiday feast, and all the benefits that come from the power of nostalgia.","Nostalgia comes from the Greek word for homecoming (nostos) and pain (algos)

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney moved another big step closer to the Republican nomination for the U.S. presidency this week: a very competent candidate with a stunning amount of cash and a court ruling that will keep the funds flowing. ""Napoleon said god is on the side of big battalions. Voters are usually on the side of big money,"" said CNN political analyst Paul Begala. Romney got the support of 46 percent of Republican voters in the Florida primary election, the latest of the state-by-state votes leading to the contest against Barack Obama in November. Former lawmaker Newt Gingrich came in second with 32 percent. Two other candidates in the race were far behind. How does campaign finance compare around the world? Romney is a polished public speaker who ran for president four years ago and has spent the time since carefully preparing to do it again. He's also a multi-millionaire who seems to be a magnet for money. One report by Reuters news agency suggests he and his supporters collected nearly $90 million for his campaign by the end of 2011, with the campaign barely under way. By comparison, the Gingrich camp raised just under $15 million. The U.S. is one of many democracies that have tried to keep money from buying elections. But this is the first presidential election to be affected by a relatively new ruling by the country's Supreme Court. The court ruled in 2010 that organizations known as Super Political Action Committees, or Super-PACs, have a right to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections as long as they stay independent of the candidates. Hundreds of Super PACs have quickly sprung up, baking both Republicans and Democrats. In Florida, they reportedly spent even more than the presidential candidates did. ""When you have that much money washing around campaigns, there will be scandals,"" said Senator John McCain, who defeated Romney four years ago for the Republican presidential nomination but is backing him this time. Federal officials predict that this year's elections to the White House, Congress and state offices could involve $11 billion in spending. Even without any big scandals so far, that's an awful lot of uncontrolled cash.","Republican Mitt Romney cements frontrunner status with victory in Florida presidential primary .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The story has all the stuff that sells: a sexy starlet, a powerful enemy spy agency and lots of bare flesh. Nude photographs of Pakistani actress Veena Malik, published in the December issue of the Indian edition of the men's magazine FHM prompted Malik to threaten a lawsuit. Malik said FHM doctored photographs to show her without clothes. The magazine, however, denied those allegations. Malik, editor Kabeer Sharma said, posed nude. What made the photos even more scandalous was that Malik's upper left arm bears the letters ISI, the acronym for Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency. In a legal notice served to the magazine, Malik contends that it was Sharma's idea for her to wear the painted on ISI tattoo; she was told t would be good for her image. And in another photo, which was originally slated for the cover, she is shown holding a grenade in her right hand. FHM published the grenade photo inside, with a line plastered across it: ""The cover we didn't use."" Sharma said the magazine opted not to use the photo on the cover because it ""could have offended sensibilities."" But the magazine has already incensed Malik. Lawyer Ayaz Bilawala told CNN that Malik is seeking $1.9 million in damages. Bilawala said the publication ""cheated"" his client and doctored the nude pictures. ""Proceedings (in a court of law) will begin soon,"" he said. FHM, Bilawala said, violated its agreement with the Pakistani model that stipulated that Malik would be shown the photos from the shoot before they were published. ""The pictures that are on display are tampered with, morphed and doctored,"" he said. Bilawala didn't dispute the ISI print on Malik's left upper arm but said numerous organizations worldwide used the same acronym. He refused comment on the grenade-like object. FHM India hinted at countersuing the actress. ""These allegations are completely and entirely false. We are exploring various other options, including filing a countersuit,"" Sharma told CNN. Malik said she never agreed to pose nude, the prospect of which sparked outrage in her homeland. ""What I am doing takes a lot of guts,"" she said. ""If I had posed nude for the magazine, I would be the first to admit it. But I didn't agree to this and they are wrong. ""I did not go for this, and I am deeply shocked and depressed about what has happened,"" she said. But Malik is no stranger to controversy. She triggered uproar two years ago when she claimed that her former boyfriend, Pakistani cricketer Mohammed Asif, was involved in spot-fixing international matches. Asif was found guilty last month in an English court. A year later, the actress came under fire from Pakistani clerics who decried her behavior in the Indian reality TV show ""Big Boss,"" as ""un-Islamic."" ""I am not a perfect Muslim or a perfect person, but I haven't committed a crime, and unfortunately things like this are part and parcel of the industry I work in,"" Malik said. Still, she downplayed her criticism back home. ""I am not bothered about what they think,"" she said. ""My fans and many Pakistanis support me and believe (in) me.""

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India's supreme court Thursday ordered the cancellation of 122 cellular permits that have been at the center of a multibillion-dollar scandal involving the country's booming telecommunication sector, attorneys said. A telecom minister awarded the licenses in 2008. The former minister -- A. Raja -- is in jail for his alleged role in what is believed to be a rigged sale of radio waves to companies. Lawyer Prashant Bhushan called the judgment ""historic."" ""It will change the manner in which corruption will be examined and dealt with in the country,"" said Bhushan, also the petitioner. The top court directed the country's telecom regulator to create in the next four months new ways for issuing licenses that it said had been granted in ""arbitrary and unconstitutional"" manner, attorneys said. The 2008 license sale is seen as India's biggest corruption scandal -- one that rattled Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government and investor confidence in Asia's third-largest economy. A number of corporate executives, bureaucrats and high-profile politicians, including Raja, are facing trial in connection with the suspected scam revealed by the national auditor two years ago. India recorded a fiscal deficit of 4.7% of its GDP in 2010-11. But Singh's top economic adviser, C. Rangarajan, has warned it would be difficult for the country to bring the gap down in the current financial year. In 2010, India raised billions of dollars from an auction of telecom licenses that surged beyond expectations and helped the country trim its losses. An auction of the 2008 controversial sale of the telecom bandwidth, canceled by the supreme court, could generate new revenues for the Indian government that is struggling to cut deficits that economists blame on high subsidy bills. ""Over the medium term, we should draw up an appropriate roadmap to reach the FRBM (fiscal responsibility and budget management) target of 3% of the GDP. We must focus particularly on reducing the overall level of subsidies as a proportion of (the) GDP,"" Rangarajan cautioned in his talk on the Indian economy on Tuesday. Uninor, the Indian joint venture of Norway's Telenor and Unitech, is among companies impacted by Thursday's verdict. ""We have been unfairly treated as we simply followed the government process we were asked to,"" it said in a statement, CNN-IBN reported. ""We are shocked to see that Uninor is being penalized for faults the court has found in the government process."" Business analysts, however, fear the ruling could hurt investment sentiments in India. ""The judgment, though correct on the aspects of law, leads to a larger question about government policy and the validity of doing business in the country,"" said Rishi Sahai, managing director of financial consultancy Cogence Advisors. ""For foreign investors, there's probably a big concern now that whether the huge amounts of money they put in stand vulnerable in Indian courts. This ruling, no doubt, has set a bad precedent for further investment in our country,"" Sahai remarked. The Indian government, cornered by opposition and civil society activists over a raft of corruption cases, sought to downplay business worries. ""At last, we have put an end to the kind of confusion that prevails in the market,"" telecom minister Kapil Sibal, in welcoming the verdict. Sibal insisted the ruling offered clarity to telecom businesses. Spectrum, he explained, would be available only through auction and not on a first-come, first-served basis that the court found discriminatory. In his comments, J.S. Sarma, head of India's telecom regulator, suggested subscribers of the affected license holders port out to other service providers within the stipulated four months. He said the ruling impacts 5% of the country's cellular market, the world's second-largest, with at least 894 million users.","NEW: Telecom minister says verdict puts an end to confusion in the market .

"(CNN) -- Mark Cavendish capped a superb week for Britain at the world cycling championships by winning the men's road race title Sunday with a trademark sprint finish. Cavendish, the pre-race favorite on a course well-suited to his talents, timed his burst to perfection to take gold from Australia's Matthew Goss with Andre Greipel of Germany taking the bronze medal. It was Britain's first men's road race title since the legendary Tom Simpson won in 1965 and took them to the top of the medals table at the championships in Copenhagen. They claimed two gold, two silvers and two bronze medals as their dominance in track cycling extended to the various road disciplines. Cavendish paid tribute to his teammates after they had paced him through the majority of the 260km race over 17 laps but with a tough uphill finish. ""There couldn't be any other result after the way the guys rode today,"" Cavendish told Eurosport. ""I'm so proud."" An early breakaway gained nearly 10 minutes, but with Britain forcing the pace at the front, it was pulled back and the decisive action took place on the last lap. Tour de France hero Thomas Voeckler made a typical charge, but with time trial silver medalist Bradley Wiggins and the experienced David Millar to the fore, Britain were able to nullify his attempt. In the uphill finish, it was the Australians who moved to the front, but Cavendish came through fast near the barriers and once he hit the front there was only one winner. Milan-San Remo winner Goss closed on the line while Greipel edged out Switzerland's Fabian Cancellara for the final podium spot.","Britain's Mark Cavendish wins world road race title in Copenhagen .

"(CNN) -- Ain Shams University Biologist Hebat Abdel Hadi is taking ""waste not, want not"" to a whole other level. Alphonso Van Marsh discovered first hand how damaging the Nile crayfish can be. She says crayfish carcasses the part of the crustacean that humans often throw away are for the birds. As higher chicken feed costs push multi-national chicken firms like Pilgrim's Pride and Tyson's Food to report losses this year, Abdel Hadi says crayfish waste is an alternative source for the protein and minerals necessary to raise chickens. Abdel Hadi earned her PhD exploring the use of crayfish as chicken feed. Her studies included comparing chickens fed with fish meal, with those raised on meal made with crayfish waste. ""The group of chickens [that we raised] on crayfish have stronger bones, have a higher optical density of meat. The color of the meat is better, the taste is better, it looks better,"" she says. The crayfish carcass is largely shell and skeleton. Feed nutritionists say crayfish-sourced feed would therefore contain high percentages of calcium and minerals. As a result, Abdel Hadi says, her experiments show that chickens raised on a crayfish feed diet lay more, stronger, higher-protein eggs. But poultry nutrition experts warn that chicken farming is a complex science that involves multiple nutrition and energy needs. ""The challenge has to do more with genetics, and the right balance for this fast growing bird,"" says Martin Humphries, Feed Sales Director for an English specialist poultry feed supplier. ""Crayfish heads will have some meat in there for protein. Crayfish skeletons will have calcium and I'm sure there is a nutritional value but perhaps [feeding crayfish to chickens] is a leap too far for now,"" Humphries says. Egypt is experiencing a crayfish invasion along the Nile River. Scientists like Dr. Madgy Khalil, who also works at Ain Shams University, say there are unprecedented numbers of crayfish thriving in the Nile with no natural predator, from the Mediterranean Sea or from the south of Egypt. The crayfish that have a penchant for clawing into fishermen's nets and eating their catch are causing problems for fishermen. But are there enough crayfish to sustain a chicken feed industry? Andrew Kendall, a spokesman with the UK's largest feed manufacturer BOCM Pauls is unsure. ""Theoretically, it is possible to use crayfish remains, but they would be in such short supply it would not be a feasible solution. For manufacturers who make any kind any business on a large scale, there's not enough [crayfish] supply to be a viable business. However, it could be better for a niche market,"" he says.","CNN's Alphonso Van Marsh spent time with Nile fishermen in Egypt .

"(CNN) -- A 2-year-old boy who authorities say was abducted by a stranger Saturday following a home invasion robbery that ended in a double homicide has been found, police in Virginia said. The suspect fled the scene, stealing a vehicle that was idling near the home, authorities said. The toddler, identified as Kaiden Gage Burnside, was inside the vehicle, they said. ""The car and the child have been recovered,"" said Lt. Ronnie Armstead, a spokesman for the Richmond Police Department. The identities of the shooting victims were not released and it was not immediately known what relation, if any, they had to the missing boy. The suspect has no relation to the child, Armstead said. Authorities have put together the events of the alleged home invasion and shooting through the statements of a witness who was inside the house at the time of the shooting, Armstead said. That witness was not related to the suspect nor man and woman who were killed, he said. Police have issued an arrest warrant for Jamal Clemons, 27, on suspicion of abduction, robbery, robbery with a firearm, using a firearm in the commission of a felony and a felon being in possession of a firearm, Armstead said.

"(CNN) -- British innovator James Dyson, who has built a multi-billion dollar empire around his distinctive vacuum cleaners, has described patent laws across Europe as ""absolute madness"", saying they are unhelpful for inventors and small businesses. Dyson told CNN he wants the patent system in Europe radically overhauled. Over the last four decades, Dyson said, he has been affected enormously by people copying his ideas. Government leaders are continuously telling businesses that innovation drives the economy. But Dyson points to the red tape surrounding the patenting process as being a massive hurdle for businesses wanting to develop ideas. ""The problem with inventing: as soon as you file a patent they see what you are doing and they can see ways to get around it,"" said Dyson, who made his fortune inventing a bagless vacuum. The 64-year-old is an outspoken critic of Chinese counterfeiters, calling on governments to do more to protect intellectual property rights. Problems can arise because of the wording of the patents, Dyson said. ""There are no diagrams or drawings and often something hinges on the particular phrasing of the patent."" According to Dyson, if it is obvious someone has copied another person's ideas they should be dealt with without the parties going through a protracted legal battle. ""There shouldn't be this endless rigmarole of 'could this have been devised by one skilled in the art?'"" Because the current system involves many expenses due to varying jurisdictions throughout the continent, a Europe-wide patent is the answer, according to Dyson. ""You have to file in each country, you have to translate in each country, sue in each country, renews in each country -- it's seen as a profit center for each country."" Issues surrounding plagiarism are not limited to businesses, with consumers also feeling the impact of the high cost of producing and securing new inventions, Dyson said. Energy-saving and cost effective products and technology won't be created because of the enormous upfront investment it takes to develop them, he said ""It's anticompetitive to make copying easy.""

"New York (CNN) -- Prosecutors in New York on Thursday accused three Lebanese financial institutions of money laundering that benefited the militant group Hezbollah, and they demanded forfeitures and penalties totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. A civil action alleges that hundreds of millions of dollars in drug profits and other money were laundered through the Lebanese Canadian Bank as well as two exchange houses. The primary method, it alleges, was by mingling that cash with the finances of legitimate businesses -- primarily a network of about 30 U.S.-based car exporters, who shipped more than $1 billion worth of cars from the United States to West Africa for sale. It said dealers in about 10 states were involved, but there was no evidence the U.S.-based businesses were aware of the Hezbollah connection. Prosecutors said in their announcement, ""Cash from the sale of the cars in West Africa was mixed with proceeds from narcotics trafficking, and then transferred to Lebanon through (Hezbollah)-controlled money-laundering channels,"" and ""part of the proceeds was used to support (Hezbollah)."" The filing says the bank permitted Hezbollah-related entities to move as much as $260,000 a day through their accounts, without disclosing the source or purpose of the money. In February, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the Lebanese Canadian Bank as a ""financial institution of primary money laundering concern."" Since then, the bank has been acquired by the subsidiary in Lebanon of Société Générale. Before the acquisition, the accused bank had 35 branches in Lebanon and had grown in recent years from assets of $2.83 billion in 2005 to $5.18 billion in 2009. Prosecutors on Thursday demanded the bank's assets be forfeited due to the alleged wrongdoing. The chairman of Lebanese Canadian Bank, Georges Zard Abou Jaoude, told CNN on Thursday, ""We deny any relation whatsoever with Hezbollah."" He said that the before the bank's sale, ""All the accounts were scrutinized, through three international auditors. We didn't have any evidence backing all these allegations."" He added that the bank had used safeguards to prevent transactions by known money launders. ""We never had any transaction or any connection with any name which was blacklisted. The moment a name appeared on the screen, we froze the account,"" he said. CNN was not able to reach Hezbollah officials immediately for comment. But the group's chief political strategist, speaking to The New York Times this week, said the group had no relationship to the Lebanese Canadian Bank and dismissed the American allegations of a drug connection as politically motivated propaganda. On Tuesday, prosecutors in Virginia also indicted a Lebanese man they allege was at the center of the laundering network and who they say has ties to Hezbollah -- although he is not a member of the group. They assert that Ayman Joumaa coordinated the smuggling and sale of at least 90 tons of cocaine destined for the United States and laundered hundreds of millions of dollars for drug gangs in Mexico and Colombia such as the notorious Zetas. According to the indictment, Joumaa laundered as much as $200 million a month and made bulk cash deliveries to South America in amounts as high as $4 million. ""He moved the money,"" said Brian Dodd, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who coordinated the Joumaa investigation. ""He couldn't have survived without Hezbollah. And he was a source of revenue for Hezbollah."" Joumaa is not in custody, and officials would only say they believe him to be in the Middle East. Hezbollah, which the United States has designated a terrorist organization, is an influential member of the government in Lebanon. But it also has a history of terror attacks against American interests, dating back to the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1983. Now Hezbollah may be using criminal proceeds to help pay for its militant operations, according to DEA agent Derek Maltz. ""The worldwide demand for drugs is actually helping terror groups fund their activities,"" Maltz said. ""And these groups want to destroy America."" Jonathan Schanzer, an ex-Treasury Department terror finance analyst who is with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said, ""Hezbollah can do a lot of damage, and the more money that rolls in, the more problematic that will be. ""You have an organization right now that has been operating a massive criminal enterprise,"" he said, ""and using that money to further its aims in the region -- which is about creating a little mini-state inside of Lebanon, amassing weapons, threatening Israel, providing assistance to the insurgency in Iraq, providing assistance to other terrorist organizations around the world."" Schanzer said this week's allegations raised concerns about how many other unseen activities -- financial or military -- Hezbollah may be conducting. But the recent moves by prosecutors against Hezbollah's money supply could take a toll on the militant group's potency, he said -- along with a reduction in funds from its main backers, Syria and Iran, in the wake of tightened international sanctions. ""Their arm gets a little bit shorter,"" he said, ""and their influence begins to wane just a little bit.""

"(CNN) -- Europe's leaders warned 2012 was likely to be tougher than 2011, when spiralling borrowing costs forced political change in Italy and Spain and threatened the survival of the euro. In a sombre address on national television Nicolas Sarkozy, president of France, said the gravest crisis Europe has faced since the second world war ""is not over"" and Angela Merkel, German chancellor, told German voters ""next year will no doubt be more difficult than 2011"". The euro crisis in 2011 forced borrowing costs higher for Italy and Spain and led to the dismissal of Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right government in Rome and the fall of the Socialist administration of JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero in Madrid. It also undermined sentiment in the euro which had a second consecutive year of losses against the dollar and fell to its lowest level in a decade against the yen. Speaking on national television on Saturday, Ms Merkel said Europe was experiencing its ""harshest test in decades"" but would ultimately be made stronger by the crisis. Mr Sarkozy, who is facing a tough re-election campaign later this year, said French voters were more anxious at the end of the year than they were at the beginning. ""This extraordinary crisis, without doubt the gravest since the second world war, is not over ... you are ending the year more anxious for yourselves and your children."" Europe's political leaders will begin talks later this month to amend the intergovernmental pact agreed by all 27 members of the European Union, except the UK, at a summit in Brussels last month. Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel are due to meet on January 9 to discuss a series of amendments to the proposals, including the creation of a ""road map"" for commonly-issued eurozone bonds in a new European treaty on fiscal discipline. The state of Italy's public finances were at the centre of Giorgio Napolitano's New Year address. The president of Europe's third-largest economy urged Italians to make sacrifices to rescue the country's public finances. ""Sacrifices are necessary to ensure the future of young people, it's our objective and a commitment we cannot avoid,"" he said. ""No one, no social group, can today avoid the commitment to contribute to the clean-up of public finances in order to prevent the financial collapse of Italy."" Italy, the world's third-largest bond market, is seen by many investors as the barometer for the eurozone debt crisis and faces a crucial opening to the year with auctions of more than â‚¬100bn in the first quarter alone. Mario Monti, the new prime minister of Italy, said in his end-of-year address last week that Italy had hauled itself back from the ""edge of the precipice"" but he said more needed to be done to reform labour markets and the service sector to restore competitiveness to the stalling economy. In Greece, Lucas Papademos, the new technocratic prime minister, also warned of a difficult year ahead. ""We have to continue our efforts with determination, so that the sacrifices we have made up to now won't be in vain,"" he said in a televised address on Saturday.","French president said the gravest crisis Europe has faced since the second world war ""is not over""

"Cairo (CNN) -- Security forces fired Thursday at protesters in a Damascus suburb visited by Arab League monitors and more than 30 people died in regions targeted by the observers, opposition activists said. The forces shot at demonstrators assembling in the Grand Mosque area of Douma as the observers arrived at the city's municipal building, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition activist group. About 30,000 demonstrators were there, the observatory said. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, another opposition activist network, reported ""massive crowds in front of the National Hospital in the presence of the Arab observers committee, who arrived after the fall of seven martyrs and dozens of wounded and detainees."" An amateur video said to be from Douma showed soldiers congregating on one end of the street and protesters congregating down the road. People chanted ""God is Great"" and ""Freedom from Bashar."" Arab League monitors who had been working in the opposition center of Homs arrived in the cities of Daraa, Idlib and Hama, and visited the Damascus area. Deaths were reported in all of those regions. Of the 38 people killed on Thursday, 13 died in the Damascus suburbs, eight died in Hama, 11 in Homs, and five in Idlib province and one in Daraa, the LCC said. A brigadier general who is the chief of a military engineering college was shot and wounded in Homs. The Syrian Arab News Agency said he was assaulted by an ""armed terrorist group."" The observatory said a group of ""unknown armed men"" tried to assassinate him. Since the observers arrived in Syria on Tuesday, more than 130 people -- six of them children -- have been killed, the LCC said. Fact-finders are monitoring an Arab League initiative that calls for President Bashar al-Assad's security forces to withdraw from cities, release detainees and end violence. Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby met in Cairo with Burhan Ghalioun, head of Syrian National Council opposition movement. They discussed the purpose of the monitoring mission and its execution, the league said. Many Syrians have been supportive of the mission, but others have derided the effort as pointless. Opposition activists have criticized the selection of a Sudanese military commander, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Ahmed Mustafa al-Dabi, as the head of the monitoring group. The activists said he had a key position in the government as atrocities occurred in Sudan's Darfur region. Khaled Abo Saleh, an opposition activist who said he met Wednesday with al-Dabi and others from the mission in Homs, said Syrians want the observers ""to reveal the truth to the world. To show what is happening here accurately and completely and to protect civilians."" ""The people of Homs and the youth activists have no faith in the Arab League mission. It is clear now they are just another ploy by the Syrian regime to buy time. They are ineffective and have no resources to change the situation. ""But we are doing our part showing them what is happening in Homs, submitting evidence of killing and arbitrary arrest,"" he said. Saleh said killings have decreased but have not stopped in Syria since the observers arrived. More than 5,000 people have been killed since mid-March, the United Nations said. Activist groups count more than 6,000 deaths. ""Generally, we have 25 to 30 killed in Homs every day, now maybe the death toll is nine to 10. But the martyrs cannot be counted in numbers; they must be counted in the loss to their family and the devastation to their people,"" Saleh said. ""I told al-Dabi that 15 people were killed in a protest the day the mission arrived in Homs. I showed him the body of a toddler killed by Syrian security forces. I took him to see the destroyed neighborhoods and the parts of Homs completely cut off from food, water, and electricity,"" Saleh said. CNN cannot independently verify opposition accounts of violence or reports of deaths and injuries in Syria. Al-Assad's government has restricted access by international journalists. An Arab League official told CNN that 75 monitors were in Syria with more expected to arrive in coming days. A permanent team will remain in Homs, which had been under a military siege for days, said the official, who asked not to be named. Ibrahim Zafarani, a founding member of the Arab Doctors Association, pulled out of the Arab League fact-finding mission after being selected as a monitor, saying he disagreed with the mission's methods. On Thursday, he added his voice to the growing criticism of al-Dabi, saying, ""All I see now is the head of the mission barely announcing any information, while dozens have died in the first two days of the mission."" ""I would not have allowed people dying under the umbrella of the monitors mission and face the guilt,"" he said. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland noted that a video posted on YouTube shows a democracy rally in Idlib ""that went forward with quite a crowd, at the same time that the monitors were there. So clearly, their presence appears to have provided some space for public expression."" She added, ""we see some, some positive signs, but not enough."" She noted ""a modest prisoner release,"" but said that the highest-profile political activists remain incarcerated. Fouad Ajami, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, predicted the unrest in Syria will devolve into a long civil war. ""The regime can't bury this revolution; the revolution can't overthrow the regime,"" he told CNN. ""The international community has really been disgraceful, and the belief in the Arab League has been such a sham."" In Syria, the unrest began in March when the government brutally cracked down on peaceful demonstrators calling for political reforms and criticizing security force actions. The movement quickly spiraled into a call for the ouster of al-Assad.

"(CNN) -- Liverpool have secured the biggest sponsorship deal in the English Premier League club's history after they announced a four-year deal with Standard Chartered Bank. Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish and managing director Christian Purslow confirm the new sponsorship deal. The Reds have confirmed that the bank will replace current sponsors Carlsberg at the start of the 2010-11 season, ending a 17-year association with the Reds, for the beer maker. The figure for the sponsorship has not be disclosed but reports in British newspaper The Guardian suggest the deal is worth $133 million. Liverpool managing director Christian Purslow spoke of his delight on sealing the sponsorship agreement for the Anfield-based side. ""I am tremendously excited - it's a hugely important day in the history of Liverpool FC,"" he told the club's official Web site. ""This is the largest commercial agreement we have ever entered into. To have attracted a partner of the caliber of Standard Chartered Bank says everything about where we are trying to take this football club. ""They operate in a number of markets around the world where we have a long term plan to increase the family of Liverpool fans and this agreement will be very helpful to us in doing that."" Purslow added: ""Many branches in these countries will effectively be a shop window for Liverpool FC and a means of attracting more supporters to the cause. ""We aspire to be the best at what we do on and off the field. This is the first commercial agreement the club has entered into which can truly be described as the best of its kind in world football. ""I hope this tells everyone, especially our fans, what we are trying to do with this football club in the future."" The move follows Liverpool's American owners, George Gillett and Tom Hicks, concluding a deal in July to re-finance a $380 million bank loan they took out to buy the club in 2007. Plans to develop a new 60,000-seater stadium at a cost of $580 million were shelved due to the recession in 2008 by the club, despite planning permission being granted by the local city council.","Liverpool announce a new sponsorship deal with Standard Chartered Bank .

"(EW.com) -- Liam Neeson, fighter of wolves, may be the closest thing the box office has to an alpha male. The 59-year-old actor's latest thriller, ""The Grey,"" debuted in first place with a better-than-expected $20 million, according to studio estimates. That places the R-rated film just below the openings of Neeson's ""Taken"" ($24.7 million) and ""Unknown"" ($21.9 million). It also represents a major win for Open Road Films, the new distributor formed by AMC Theatres and Regal Cinemas. Although ""The Grey"" cost a reported $34 million to produce, Open Road acquired the wilderness-survival movie for just $5 million. The well-reviewed but admittedly harsh film earned a middling ""B-"" rating from CinemaScore audiences. According to the market-research firm, 71 percent of the audience was at least 25 years old. Of particular interest, 67 percent of moviegoers listed Neeson as the reason they purchased a ticket to ""The Grey,"" confirming the actor's drawing power. Neeson is now taking suggestions on what animals he should confront next. My vote: Alvin and the Chipmunks. The weekend's two other new movies, ""One for the Money"" and ""Man on a Ledge,"" witnessed less impressive debuts. Both films were promoted with $6 ticket offers through online coupon sites (Groupon for ""One for the Money"" and LivingSocial for ""Man on a Ledge""). Also, with Lionsgate's recent acquisition of Summit Entertainment, the studio was essentially competing against itself -- ""One for the Money"" is a Lionsgate release, while ""Man on a Ledge"" is from Summit. ""One for the Money,"" a PG-13 action comedy starring Katherine Heigl as a bail-enforcement agent, landed in third place with $11.8 million. That's slightly better than what many industry experts predicted, but still represents Heigl's worst opening since breaking out in 2007â€²s ""Knocked Up."" There's a noticeable downward trajectory to the star's recent box-office performance, with each of her last four films opening to a smaller amount than the movie before it. ""One for the Money"" drew an audience that was 75 percent female, and CinemaScore participants gave it a ""B-"" grade. ""Man on a Ledge"" underwhelmed with $8.3 million -- enough for fifth place. The PG-13 thriller stars ""Avatar's"" Sam Worthington, who has yet to prove he can open a film without being surrounded by big-budget special effects. According to CinemaScore, only 17 percent of audiences listed Worthington as their reason for buying a ticket. If there's a bright spot for ""Ledge,"" it's that the movie received a ""B+"" rating from CinemaScore audiences. Among holdovers, ""Underworld: Awakening"" fell 51 percent for $12.5 million. That's actually the best second-weekend hold for any ""Underworld"" movie. After 10 days, ""Awakening"" has grossed an estimated $45.1 million -- more than any of its predecessors had in the same time frame. The World War II action film ""Red Tails"" dropped 45 percent for $10.4 million, bringing its two-week total to $33.8 million. Also, ""Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" crossed $200 million on Friday. After 45 days in theaters, ""Ghost Protocol"" has earned $202.6 million and is neck and neck with ""Mission: Impossible II,"" which collected $201.7 million in the same period. It'll be a nail-biter as ""Ghost Protocol"" attempts to pass ""Mission: Impossible II's"" final tally of $215.4 million to become the franchise's top earner. In limited release, ""Albert Nobbs,"" starring Oscar-nominated Glenn Close and Janet McTeer, debuted to a mediocre $770,000 from 245 theaters. A number of Best Picture nominees expanded this weekend to take advantage of their recent nominations. ""The Descendants,"" which increased its theater count from 560 to 2,001, jumped 176 percent to pull in $6.6 million. Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" rose 143 percent for $2.3 million. And the front-runner ""The Artist"" earned $3.3 million, pushing its cumulative total to $16.7 million. 1. The Grey -- $20.0 mil . 2. Underworld: Awakening -- $12.5 mil . 3.

"(CNN) -- Schalke joined Bayern Munich at the top of the German Bundesliga table with a 2-1 victory at Hertha Berlin on Friday. Striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar put the visitors ahead with his 14th league goal this season, while Teemu Pukki fired the winner just before halftime after Adrian Ramos equalized for Hertha. The win put Schalke on 31 points from 16 games, enough for second place on goal difference behind Bayern -- who travel to Stuttgart on Sunday. Borussia Monchengladbach can go top on Saturday with victory at bottom side Augsburg, while third-placed champions Borussia Dortmund can also move up to 33 points by beating another team in the relegation zone, Kaiserslautern, at home on Sunday. Schalke took the lead in the 19th minute on the counter-attack as Lewis Holtby released Christian Fuchs, whose cross was flicked on by Roman Hubnik to Huntelaar and the Dutchman finished at the far post. Ramos leveled six minutes later with a powerful header from Raffael's corner, but Finland striker Pukki made up for an overly casual earlier miss with a fierce shot from the edge of the box after being picked out by Raul. Huntelaar was denied in the second half by a fine save from goalkeeper Thomas Kraft, while Jose Jurado should have doubled the lead late in the game but the Spaniard shot wide. The defeat left Hertha in ninth place with 19 points, and facing the prospect of sliding down the 18-team table by the end of this weekend.","Victory at Hertha Berlin puts Schalke second in the German league table .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A mentally disabled man testified Monday he was once kept in a closet that was nailed shut by a woman at the helm of an alleged fraud and abuse scheme. Edwin Sanabria, 31, also said he did not receive his Social Security checks once he began living with Linda Weston in 2001. Sanabria testified at the preliminary hearing for Weston, 51, Gregory Thomas, 47, Eddie Wright, 49, and Jean McIntosh, 32. All four are facing charges including kidnapping, aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy and false imprisonment for holding four people in the sub-basement of a Philadelphia apartment building. McIntosh, the daughter of Weston, the alleged ringleader, remained animated throughout the hearing, shaking her head, whispering with her attorney and breaking down into tears during Sanabria's testimony. The four mentally disabled adults held captive -- Sanabria, Herbert Knowles, Tamara Breeden and Derwin McLemire -- were found in October locked in the sub-basement room with no food and only a bucket for a toilet. The pitch-black, 13-by-7 foot space houses what police described as a former boiler used to heat the building. A penetrating stench of urine and feces still hung in the chamber days after the discovery. McLemire had been chained to the boiler, police said. ""I used the bucket to go to the bathroom. Others used the same bucket,"" Sanabria testified Monday, pointing to an enlarged photo of the sub-basement. When asked where he took a bath, he said they ""used the same bucket we used to urinate in."" Sanabria said he and the others were in the basement for 10 days. He said he traveled to Philadelphia with Weston from West Palm Beach, Florida. Prosecutors showed a number of photos of the alleged victims covered in various scars, scabs and lacerations after their discovery. All appeared extremely malnourished. Police Officer John Murphy testified about discovering the victims and leading them out after the building's landlord cut McLemire's chain. ""The stench in the room and on their person was unbearable,"" Murphy said. When asked to describe the smell in the basement, he said, ""Basically, death."" He added that McLemire's chain was barely hanging on him because he was so thin. All four defendants appeared in court. Weston, who remained expressionless during the daylong hearing, wore her orange prison jumpsuit. The others wore street clothes, and McIntosh wore a hijab, or Muslim head covering. Crime scene police Officer John Tuggart testified the alleged victims had 21.5 square feet per person of living space while in the sub-basement. He described the sound of the door to the sub-basement closing as being ""like a meat locker, the way it rattles and shuts."" Tuggart added that the victims ""seemed relieved to be somewhere they were being taken care of"" at the hospital where they received treatment. The suspects also face charges including assault, terrorist threats, neglect of a care-dependent person and theft by deception. Weston served prison time in the 1980s for killing her sister's boyfriend by locking him in a closet and refusing to feed him. Court documents show Bernardo Ramos, 25, was fed only four times while locked in the closet over the two-month period. He died in 1981, at which point he weighed less than 75 pounds. His body was found in an abandoned building after it was wheeled there in a baby carriage, according to the documents. The defendants will return to court Tuesday.","Edwin Sanabria says he and three others were kept in a sub-basement for 10 days .

"(CNN) -- Miroslav Klose continued his fine scoring run with two more vital goals to keep Lazio in title contention on Saturday, while Inter Milan moved into the top half of the table. Veteran Germany international Klose has enjoyed a renaissance of his club career since moving to the Italian capital, and made it eight Serie A goals this season as Lazio scraped a 3-2 win at bottom side Lecce. The victory lifted the Rome side into second place above AC Milan and Udinese, who play Bologna and Chievo respectively on Sunday. It left Lazio a point adrift of unbeaten Juventus, who visit the Stadio Olympico on Monday to take on city rivals Roma. Despite his exploits for Germany, for whom he has scored 14 goals at three World Cups, Klose was a fringe figure at Bayern Munich before his contract expired in July. But the 33-year-old will be a key senior figure at next year's Euro 2012 finals after scoring nine goals in the qualifiers and taking his international tally to 63 -- five behind Gerd Muller's German record -- when he netted as captain in the friendly victory over the Netherlands last month. Klose leveled for Lazio from close range in the 28th minute after David Di Michele put Lecce ahead from the penalty spot, and then set up Lorik Cana two minutes after halftime. Lecce had picked up only eight points from 13 matches, but looked like adding to that when Stefano Ferrario equalized on the hour. However, Klose stole the victory for Lazio with three minutes to play when he found space to glance in a header from a cross by French forward Djibril Cisse. Inter Milan bounced back from last weekend's home defeat by Udinese with a 2-0 win against Fiorentina at the San Siro that lifted Claudio Ranieri's team into ninth place. Striker Giampaolo Pazzini netted the opening goal against his former club four minutes before halftime, pouncing for his second league goal this season after a mistake by Cesare Natali allowed him space to hook the ball past keeper Artur Boruc. Fiorentina will also rue Yuto Nagatomo's goal four minutes after the break, as Manuel Pasqual's attempted clearance ricocheted off the Japan fullback and into the net. Inter, who went through to the knockout stage of the European Champions League as group winners despite Wednesday's defeat at CSKA Moscow, have the chance to move further up the table in Tuesday's trip to Genoa. Sixth-placed Palermo remained behind Napoli on goal difference after suffering a shock 1-0 home defeat by second-bottom Cesena. Romanian striker Adrian Mutu put the visitors ahead in the 63rd minute, and Palermo's young Argentine defender Ezequiel Munoz was sent off for his second booking soon after. Genoa moved up to seventh with a 2-0 win at Siena, as captain Marco Rossi and Argentine striker Rodrigo Palacio scored in the second half.","Lazio beat Lecce 3-2 to go second in Italy's Serie A as Miroslav Klose nets twice .

Senna, the nephew of three-time world champion Ayrton Senna, joined the British-based team as a test driver in July and has yet to race competitively for the marque. German racer Heidfeld has picked up 34 points so far this season and secured a podium finish when he crossed the line in third position at April's Malaysian Grand Prix.

"(CNN) -- More than nuclear bomb tests, the suicide of former South Korean president Roh Moo-Hyun has stunned the South Korean public. While the news has shocked the nation, perhaps the level of surprise at the method wasn't as great. The suicide of former president Roh has shocked South Korea. In a country with one of the highest suicide rates among economically advanced countries, traditional concepts of honor and public ""face"" remain powerful social forces. According to World Health Organization figures, rates of suicide in South Korea doubled to 21.9 deaths per 100,000 people between 1996 and 2006. The United Nations cites that 90 percent of suicide cases were caused by mental disorders, but socio-cultural and economic pressures play a large part. While each case of suicide has a number of complex personal issues, the connection between suicide and honor has a historical basis in many Asian countries. ""There are cultural histories in Asian societies of honorable suicide, such as hara-kiri in Japan, where the person assumes total responsibility,"" said Dr. Erminia Colucci, research fellow at the University of Melbourne's School of Population Health. ""In many western countries, a suicide in someone of Roh's position might be more about looking for understanding. In collectivist societies, like Japan and Korea, where a person's identity is more tied closely to other groups, suicides can be seen as the ultimate way to rebuild or reclean your image, if it changes."" ""I think there is something paradoxical in it. On one hand, some see it as a way of maintaining status and restoring honor to you and the people you represent, but the pressure from that group could contribute to you considering suicide."" Roh was under investigation for corruption and some believe the pressures he felt just became too great. ""Roh had come to power as a human rights lawyer, as an uneducated outsider pledging to clean up Korean politics, so it was particularly hard on him to have what he stood for and the reality of what happened under his administration. I think that was particularly hard for him to take,"" David King, director of the Korean Studies Institute at the University of Southern California told CNN. Watch more on the rise and fall of Roh . In a suicide note to his family, Roh described his life as ""difficult"" and was sorry for making ""too many people suffer."" Roh had said he was ashamed about the scandal and in the first round of questioning, he said he was losing face and that he was disappointing his supporters. In South Korea, Roh is the latest and highest profile of recent suicides of public figures. In late 2008, two South Korean actors took their lives. Police cited malicious online rumors as a possible cause for the suicide of Cho Jin-sil in October 2008. The blogs and chat rooms had speculated that she had been pressuring fellow actor Ahn Jae-hwan to repay a debt before he took his own life in September 2008.  Video: How South Korean continue mourning » . High-profile suicides can make for lurid headlines, which Dr Paul Yip, director of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, believes are far from helpful in combating suicide rates. ""Common in Asia is to sensationalize suicides, especially among celebrities. Often the local or national media publish lots of details of how it was done. The media (in Hong Kong) has got better in their responsible reporting,"" he said. ""Whenever famous people kill themselves there is an effect on those people who are most vulnerable from a similar age group -- we see this in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan and China, "" said Yip. ""People at risk can see Roh's death as an example and say, 'Well if he can do it, so can I'. Neither Roh nor any of the high-profile people who have committed suicide would have thought about this affect. There are a number of complex issues. There isn't just one that leads someone to take their life."" Copycat deaths are a worry for Yip, and Colucci agreed that there can be lots of meaning in the method of a suicide, which people may be encouraged to follow. ""The way that Roh died is similar to some of the methods used in Japan, which is interesting. It really suggests it's about the people wanting to relieve the burden they feel they are on others. For young people, it can be really connected to ideas of identity. For many, they feel it's the last thing they have control over,"" said Colucci. Watch CNN's report on Japan's suicide forest . Yip advised the South Korean Ministry of Health during Roh's administration to help them devise a new approach to dealing with mental health issues and the problem of suicide. ""It is sad that Roh, whose government really did a lot to tackle the issue, should have done this. Last year a mental health act was passed by the South Korean government, as it recognized that more steps needed to be taken,"" said Yip. While there are distinct differences between the societies and traditions of Japan, Korea and Hong Kong, Yip was at least encouraged that the Chinese Special Administrative Region has seen a decline in the number of suicide cases since its peak in 2003 of some 1,200 to around 9000 . A key element has been breaking though the taboo of talking about mental health issues, one that Yip believed was common across Asia. ""They've been stigmatized, and very common that it would not be talked about, especially if there is not a good mental health support system in place. Ten years ago in Hong Kong, people didn't want to talk about it."" However, Yip is well aware of the link between suicide rates and economic change, which many have cited as a reason for suicide rates increasing. ""The rate generally goes up more in Asian countries than the west when there is an economic downturn. For an age group like Roh's, suicide can seem like a very traditional, if extreme way to solve problems. The problems at first are economic, but make people feel great shame or disgrace. There is a large sense of pride in middle-age men and working people."" Making it acceptable to talk about problems, making people feel connected to their community and having a support system in place were methods Yip believed has helped to reduce those at risk. But it was not just something that charities or governments can work on, Yip said: ""We have to reach out to the main concern groups, it's a multi-layered approach.""","South Korea has one of the highest rates of suicide in developed countries .
Concepts of honor and ""face"" remain strong social forces in many Asian societies .
Suicide is a complex mix of issues, but ideas of 'honorable' death persist ."
"(CNN) -- Brazilians are mourning the death of legendary soccer player and political activist Socrates, who died Sunday of septic shock due to an intestinal infection. Socrates Brasileiro Sampaio de Souza Vieira de Oliveira, 57, was buried in his hometown of Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, according to Brazil's official Agencia Brasil. Socrates had suffered bouts of gastrointestinal bleeding caused by cirrhosis of the liver. He had admitted to addictions to alcohol and cigarettes, Agencia Brasil said. ""It was during his third hospitalization that he confronted his addiction to alcohol and cigarettes, adding that he had 'won' another chance to recover from his complications,"" the agency reported. A qualified doctor, renowned intellectual and an outspoken, pro-democracy fighter during Brazil's brutal military dictatorship, Socrates had defied many stereotypes. The man known as ""Doctor Socrates,"" ""Golden Feet"" and ""Big Skinny"" is considered by the international football organization FIFA as one of the 100 greatest players of all time. News of his death was broadcast worldwide, an indication of his fame as one of the world's greatest players. Despite not turning professional until he was 24, the soccer legend starred for Brazil between 1979 and 1986, playing in two World Cup finals tournaments in the process. Brazilian legend Socrates dies aged 57 . However, Socrates will always be associated with the 1982 Brazilian side, which is widely regarding as the greatest team to never win the World Cup. Socrates captained the 1982 side in Spain and was widely expected to lift the World Cup trophy. But his team lost 3-2 to Italy in the second phase in one of football's most iconic matches. The Sao Paulo-based Corinthians football club, one of Brazil's heavyweight teams, was a launching pad where Socrates made his name. He became an international legend, scoring more than 300 goals. During the last game of the ""Brasileirao,"" Brazil's national soccer tournament, the Corinthians beat rival Palmeiras on Sunday. Fans held a minute of silence, holding up their left fists up high -- one of Socrates' most emblematic gestures after a triumphal match. Juca Kfouri, one of Brazil's most popular soccer columnists who knew Socrates well, said in his blog for Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper that Socrates had genius in his heels. In a hospital interview earlier this year, Socrates told Kfouri of his love for Cuba's Fidel Castro and, tragically, his love for alcohol, which became his Achilles heel. ""I am not going to change,"" Socrates told Kfouri. ""I am just going to get rid of alcohol. I've already done that."" ""He always had an absurd ability to consume alcohol, to drink and drink and not get drunk,"" Kfouri said after speaking with Socrates, who at the time had a catheter in his liver. In an official statement, President Dilma Rousseff lamented the loss of one of Brazil's ""most beloved sons"" and a ""football genius."" Rousseff and former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva recalled the athlete's unusual role as a political activist. During the military dictatorship, Socrates infuriated authorities by wearing an ""I want to vote"" banner. ""Lula,"" as the former president is known, and Socrates were friends and collaborators in the 1980s pro-democracy movement known a ""Diretas Ja."" Socrates, a rare picture of a politicized athlete, marched with trade unionists, artists and athletes to defy the military junta ruling Brazil with an iron fist, persecuting, jailing and often torturing many political dissidents. Socrates, unlike some of the more apolitical legends of the time, used his status to send a message to the world about what was happening back home. ""Dr. Socrates was a 'crack' in the football field and a great friend,"" Lula said. ""He was an example of citizenship, intelligence and political consciousness, in addition to his immense talent as a football professional."" Most recently, Socrates became a columnist for CartaCapital, a left-leaning news magazine where he wrote eloquently against racism in football, politics and his new passion, the environment. He dissected the issues with the precision of a doctor and the determination of a pro. Socrates understood that soccer was a way to communicate to Brazilians on important issues. In one of his final columns, titled ""Some Dream Others Don't,"" Socrates took on Pele for not speaking out against racism in world football. ""Nothing is more endemic (in addition to corruption) than (racism) among those in football management,"" he wrote amid recent controversy involving FIFA President Sepp Blatter and racist comments in soccer. ""Certainly all negroes in the planet felt attacked except for one: Pele,"" Socrates wrote. ""One thing we know for sure: Pele has never had a dream."" In soccer-crazed Brazil, adoring fans crowded the cemetery where Socrates was buried. Mourners sang the anthem of the Corinthians team in his memory.","The football great died Sunday at the age of 57 .

"(CNN) -- San Francisco's Candlestick Park was in need of, well, candles after two power outages stalled Monday night's football game between the 49ers and the Pittsburgh Steelers. An initial power outage struck the park shortly before the start of the game, delaying the opening kickoff, football officials said. The second delay hit early in the second quarter, briefly delaying the game, they said. ""Right now, we believe the power outage occurred because of a blown transformer. We have all our available personnel working to confirm that,"" Steve Weakland, a spokesman for the 49ers, said in a written statement. ""There are more questions than answers; we have asked PG&E to assure us and the NFL that this will not reoccur. We will continue to update you as we learn more. "" Pacific Gas and Electric Company said its crews were investigating the cause of both outages at the stadium, which is home to the 49ers. ""While we have many customers at the stadium, Candlestick Park is the only facility impacted,"" PG&E said in a written statement. Crews located a downed power line in the area and were working to determine if it was related to the first outage at the stadium, PG&E said. PG&E is working closely with San Francisco city and county officials and the owner of Candlestick Park to determine the cause, said Geisha Williams, PG&E's executive vice president of electric operations, said in a statement. ""Determining exactly what happened and working to prevent something like this from happening again is very important to everyone involved,"" the statement said. The delays in the game seemed to not hinder the 49ers as they walloped the Steelers in route to a 20-3 victory.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Famed for her opulent theatrical style in films like ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Moulin Rouge!,"" production designer Catherine Martin is probably the last person you might expect to find in the remote Outback of Australia knocking up a film set. Catherine Martin created costumes for ""Australia"" with trademark wit and whimsy. But this is exactly where the two-time Oscar-winner ended up in her role as co-producer of her husband Baz Luhrmann's latest film,""Australia,"" which stars Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman. ""I am certainly not a girlie girl,"" says Martin who worked in the role of production and costume designer on the film, which is the first identifiably Australian epic ever made. But she admits that she was grateful for help with the ""mammoth"" task of the film's logistics which she describes as an ""eye-opener."" ""Australia"" was filmed in various locations across the huge country -- Vaclause New South Wales, Bowen, Queensland where Martin and her team constructed a huge exterior set to look like 1930s-era Darwin, and finally the remote East Kimberley region of Western Australia. This is where they set about building ""Faraway Downs,"" the sprawling cattle ranch in the middle of an inhospitable wilderness. In the film it belongs to Lady Sarah's husband and saving it from a takeover plot becomes the focus of the feisty aristocrat's epic journey across Australia with rough hewn cattleman, Drover (Jackman). ""We brought everything up there,"" says Martin of the film's main set which was situated in Carlton Hill, an isolated location in an area famed for its natural beauty. It was so remote that the team had to build roads, and when Martin explains 36 huge trucks were needed to transport all the equipment and raw materials required to build ""Faraway Downs"" from scratch on the site, the scale of the production becomes clear. ""Logistically, 'Australia' was a mammoth task,"" says Martin, ""Moving those number of people, and we had to build roads to get equipment in and ship things weeks in advance so they'd actually get there."" In the flesh she is a petite and blonde with a wide-eyed enthusiasm that causes her to stress-every-syllable when she talks. She's hugely garrulous, hugely engaging and is, in fact, wearing a very girlie jacket. But it's also clear she's made of pretty steely stuff, which she needed to contend with some of the problems that beset the production. There were, as she puts it, some ""pretty crazy times."" Like when it started raining in East Kimberley during the ""dry,"" an apparently rare occurrence that, even more unusually, carried on for a number of days. Martin was in Sydney anxiously awaiting news from her team. ""I got sent a photo of ""Faraway Downs"" and it was just an open field, the house was under water. ""I just said to myself 'don't panic.' Anyway, three days in a row I got [the same] photos and I thought, 'I'm going to have to come clean, we're never going to be able to shoot in two weeks because everything will have gone moldy, the turf will be dead, the trees will be dead.'"" Martin decided to move the production back to Sydney where they would concentrate on stunt work with the horses, only to find out that an outbreak of equine flu had struck the Sydney area. ""I remember being in a car and hearing it on the radio at the very, very moment we'd decided to got back to Sydney. ""It meant we couldn't move the horses from the Northern Territory. And then we had the entire horse team running around trying to find doubles for our horses in Sydney."" Despite the pressures, Martin was still able to find the time to do what she does best -- create costumes with trademark wit and whimsy. She concentrated particularly on Kidman's costumes which Luhrmann felt were so central to the film's narrative that he wrote them into the script. In one of Lady Sarah's most sartorially absurd moments, she wears a safari-style outfit complete with pith helmet, gauze netting and wire spectacles for the three-day journey from Darwin to ""Faraway Downs"" with Drover (Hugh Jackman). To come up with the costume, Martin went to town, researching every possible picture she could find of women in safari suits in the 1930s -- from Jane in a Tarzan movie to a woman in Africa in 1932. ""It really gave me the key to the character, that Baz had her in her mind thinking this was completely appropriate. ""She was still on African safari in her head, that she was totally a fish out of water, that she had no concept of where she was coming to or the nature of the place, not one iota, she was costuming herself for the the experience and I loved that idea and that really helped me in thinking about the other costumes."" Martin is sometimes considered to be the creative brains behind her 16-year partnership with Luhrmann which began with camp classic ""Strictly Ballroom"" in 1992, but this is something she vigorously denies: ""The reality is Baz sought me out when he first started working professionally and he has always been focused on the visual aspect."" But, she says, ""I do think it is serendipitous that somehow we really do spark off each other.""","Two-time Oscar-winner Catherine Martin co-produced epic film ""Australia""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Russell Armstrong had no alcohol, prescription drugs or illegal substances in his body when he died last month, toxicology results released Wednesday by the coroner concluded. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled last month that Armstrong committed suicide by hanging himself with a rope. He appeared with his wife on Bravo's ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."" Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter dismissed any speculation, raised by a celebrity news website report, that Armstrong could have been murdered. His wife, Taylor Armstrong, agrees that it was a suicide, Winter told CNN. He said she told him in a conversation Wednesday that she does not believe her husband was murdered. Russell Armstrong was found dead at a home in the hills above the Los Angeles suburb of Bel Air last month, police said. His wife had filed for divorce in July, telling People magazine that she was verbally and physically abused during their nearly six-year marriage. Armstrong, who was defending himself against a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, was financially drained at the time of his death, his lawyer Ronald Richards said. His credit cards had been suspended, adding to the pressure, he said. Armstrong complained before his death that the reality show was going to ""crucify"" him in its upcoming season, his mother said last month. John Ann Hotchkiss said she would like to see more investigation into her son's death. ""I don't think he would do this,"" she said Wednesday evening on HLN's ""Issues"" with Jane Velez-Mitchell. ""He loved his family. He loved his children almost to a fault. They were everything to him."" ""Absolutely it was not a suicide,"" said Armstrong's sister, Laurie Armstrong Kelsoe. ""This is real to our family,"" Kelsoe told HLN's Nancy Grace. ""We need to put a face on this man that they have depicted as a monster, and he is not."" CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.","NEW: Mother, sister disagree with finding, want more investigation .

"(ArsTechnica) -- Amidst all the shouting over Tuesday's transfer of the House of Representatives to Republican control, a distinct cry of pain could be heard for the loss of one voice -- Representative Rick Boucher (D-VA). Republican Morgan Griffith, majority leader of Virginia's House of Delegates, has taken Boucher's seat. As Chair of the influential Subcommittee on the Internet of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Boucher's imprint on tech issues -- particularly online privacy -- was clear as a bell. Now he is gone. ""Tonight the Congress has lost one of its most intelligent and tech-saavy members,"" a press statement from Gigi Sohn of Public Knowledge declared late Tuesday. ""Rick Boucher has been one of the most moderate and thoughtful voices on communications and intellectual property policy."" A long shadow . Earlier this year, Boucher proposed a bill that would bar companies from using a cell phone's geolocation information without a consumer's consent. Ditto for content on race, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation. For most other information, a simple opt-out would keep data from being used by first- or third-party vendors. Many of Boucher's Internet policy oriented Democratic colleagues survived this election. These would include pro-net neutrality stalwart Edward Markey (D-MA) as well as Henry Waxman (D-CA), who unsuccessfully tried to push a compromise open Internet bill through Congress last month. Other Democratic survivors include Anna Eshoo (D-CA), who launched bills against loud television commercials and for automatic fiber conduits included in every road construction project. Meet the replacements . But in the next Congress these Democrats will sit on the minority side of the aisle. The big Republican voices that will replace them on the House Commerce Committee have been very vocal on communications technology issues. They include former committee Chair Joe Barton (R-TX), who ultimately refused to go along with Waxman's net neutrality compromise, Fred Upton (R-MS), and Cliff Stearns (R-FL). The latter takes particular interest in mobile phone and wireless spectrum concerns. Still, despite all the ""no compromise"" rhetoric that's flying about, there may be some continuity in various policy areas -- particularly regarding online privacy. In early October, Barton and Markey sent a long list of tough questions to Facebook, Yahoo, Microsoft and other companies about their Web privacy policies, particularly as they related to cookies and data retention. Barton has just released a statement in response to Facebook's answers. ""It's good that Facebook was in a hurry to respond to our concerns, but the fact remains that some third-party applications were knowingly transferring personal information in direct violation of Facebook's privacy promises to its users,"" he warned. ""I want the Internet economy to prosper, but it can't unless the people's right to privacy means more than a right to hear excuses after the damage is done. In the next Congress, the Energy and Commerce Committee and our subcommittees are going to put Internet privacy policies in the crosshairs."" A privacy bill on the way? And there will have to be some concurrence with the Democrats on these hot-button questions, because they've retained control over the Senate. That means that Senate Commerce Committee Chair Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) will remain a critical voice on Web-related concerns on that side of the aisle -- Rockefeller warned just last week that he may submit a privacy bill to Congress himself. So while the partisan rhetoric may fly on questions like net neutrality, various forms of consensus may also surface on occasion, particularly in areas like online privacy and getting more spectrum licenses to the wireless industry. It all depends on who winds up where in the next Capitol Hill. COPYRIGHT 2011 ARSTECHNICA.COM .","Morgan Griffith, majority leader of Virginia's House of Delegates, took Boucher's seat .

"(CNN) -- Editor's note: Matt Walton a technology and engineering education teacher at Glen Allen High School in Henrico County, Virginia. He has a master's degree in education and a bachelor of science degree in technology education from North Carolina State University. You might have noticed a recent TV commercial from Chevron Corp. showing a Chevron professional next to an eighth-grade student with a robot. The student describes the remote control robot, and the young Chevron professional talks about how a high school science teacher made him what he is today (a geologist for Chevron). The next part of the commercial caught my attention, because in bold letters the words ""Science Rules"" flashed on the screen. While I agree that ""science rules,"" so does technology and engineering. What the ad is demonstrating is not science education, but rather the middle two letters of STEM - or science, technology, engineering and math - education. Often technology and engineering education is overlooked when people talk about STEM education or when governments make decisions about education policy. In last year's State of the Union address, President Barack Obama called for adding ""100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math."" This call for new teachers was laudable, however, science and math education receive the majority of attention and support from universities, various levels of government and the public. One reason is because math and science are required classes throughout a student's educational career, unlike technology and engineering. Additionally, as you examine the landscape of colleges and universities around the country, it's easy to find a school where you can study to become a science or math teacher. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for technology and engineering education as many colleges and universities have cut their programs, and sadly so have some high and middle schools. Technology and engineering education is exhibited in many different ways when you look at that robot in the commercial. The physical appearance of the robot incorporates one of the main cornerstones of technology and engineering education: design. Design in technology and engineering education can come in various forms. One is digital design through digital photography and Photoshop to generate a treatment and produce a video. Another aspect covered in technology education classes focuses on engineering design by creating a more efficient shopping cart or a new blade design for a wind turbine. You can find many diverse concepts and principles in technology and engineering labs. Students can learn engineering principles such as aerodynamics through the creation of carbon-dioxide-powered cars. Students are able to explore aerospace engineering by building complex rockets and simple rubberband-powered planes that can stay in the air for minutes. Students learn principles of chemical engineering when they make bioplastics and biofuels. When you look at the robot in the commercial, you can see design in the way that the robot is built and how the parts of the robot interact with one another to achieve the goals of the creator. Here the examples of engineering become glaring and are even highlighted by the student. The fact that the student has four servo motors on the robot and not three, five or six demonstrates that the student used engineering concepts to determine the amount of lift, torque and speed needed to achieve the most efficient robot. If you were to walk into a high school technology and engineering class, the first thing you will notice is a lab full of busy students working diligently on projects and creating things. Students are often excited to learn because they can express their creativity and apply what they are reading about and taking notes on in other classes. Through project-based learning, students gain knowledge in different areas of technology and engineering, much of which reinforces what they have learned from their science and math teachers. And science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM education has an important economic impact as well. According to a July report by the U.S Department of Commerce, STEM-related jobs are projected to grow by 17% by 2018, compared with 9.8% for non-STEM professions. Additionally, even in the midst of the Great Recession, STEM joblessness has been almost half of non-STEM jobs. While the unemployment for non-STEM jobs topped out around 10%, STEM jobs never cracked the 6% mark. As a country we need to focus on improving in all areas of science, technology, engineering and math education if we are to succeed in creating and competing for the jobs that will be prevalent in the decades to come. However, it's vital to our nation and to our students not to overlook the ""T and E"" in STEM. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matt Walton.","Matt Walton is a technology and engineering education teacher in Virginia .
