"ISIS wants to introduce its own currency and plans to bring back solid gold and silver dinar coins, it has emerged. The Middle East terror group apparently wants to introduce its own Islamic currency as part of its attempts to solidify its makeshift caliphate. Militants are said to want to bring back the original dinar, which is an ancient currency from early Islam, and religious figures in Mosul and Iraq’s Nineveh province have apparently announced its return in mosques. ISIS apparently wants to introduce its own currency and plans to bring back gold and silver dinar coins (above) The currency known as the dinar, which once consisted purely of gold and silver coins, is today used by a variety of countries, but the coins are created from different materials to the originals. However, the jihadi group is understood to be planning to return to the original gold and silver coins, which were first introduced during the Caliphate of Uthman in 634 CE. The original Islamic dinar was a gold coin which was the weight of gold equivalent to 4.3 grams. Its silver counterpart, known as the Islamic dirham, was a silver coin equal in weight to 3 grams of silver. Both were round in shape and one side of the coin was typically stamped with an Islamic message, while the other side featured the date of minting and the country’s ruler. The terror group,  led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured addressing Muslim worshippers at a mosque in the militant-held northern Iraqi city of Mosul), is apparently keen to introduce its own currency to areas it controls . The original dinar coins were first introduced during the Caliphate of Uthman in 634 CE. The coins were made purely from gold and silver and were round in shape. The gold coin was known as the Islamic dinar, while the silver was known as the Islamic dirham. Typically, one side of the coin was stamped with an Islamic message, while the other side featured the date of minting and the country’s ruler. While ISIS has yet to confirm the introduction of its currency, social media is awash with claims that leading religious figures announced the plans during recent prayers in Mosul and Nineveh province. It is believed the terror outfit wants to use the independent currency in areas it controls as part of its war on the West. The currency, which could be introduced within the next few weeks, will involve changing from regular dinars and Lira to golden dinars and silver dirhams. Last month, it emerged that ISIS, which also goes by the name Islamic State, is raking in money at a remarkable rate - earning about $1million a day from black market oil sales alone. The group extracts oil from territory captured across Syria and Iraq, and sells it to smugglers. David Cohen, who leads the Treasury Department's effort to undermine the Islamic State's finances, said the extremists also get several million dollars a month from wealthy donors, extortion rackets and other criminal activities, such as robbing banks. In addition, he said the group has taken in at least $20million in ransom payments this year from kidnappings. Mr Cohen said ISIS, which is led by Iraqi Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,obtains the vast majority of its revenues through local criminal and terrorist activities.","ISIS said to be planning to introduce its own currency to areas it controls .

"A senior French politician has called for Devil’s Island to be reopened – as a prison for jihadis returning to Europe after travelling abroad to fight. Nicolas Dupont-Aignan – who stood as a candidate for the French presidency in 2012 – believes that the former penal colony in South America would be a fitting place for ‘the madmen’ who have fought with radical groups such as Islamic State (IS) and Al Qaeda. The island in French Guiana is notorious as the place where French army officer Alfred Dreyfus was unjustly held at the end of the 19th Century after being accused of treason, and as the location of the 1973 film Papillon, starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. Scroll down for video . Devil's Island in French Guiana, which French politician Nicolas Dupont-Aignan has said would be a fitting place to hold people who have fought with radical groups such as Islamic State and Al Qaeda . Mr Dupont-Aignan – the founder of the right-wing DLF party and an affiliate to the UMP, the party of the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy – admitted the proposal would ‘cause a stir’, but insisted it had widespread support. It is the latest suggested solution for the problem of what to do with returning jihadis. In Britain, there have been demands for extremists to be denied re-entry into the country. Referring to the official name for Devil’s Island, Mr Dupont-Aignan said he ‘proposes the re-establishment of a Cayenne detention centre which would allow us to permanently isolate the madmen’. He insisted the regime would not be like that of the original Devil’s Island, where tropical disease, starvation and savage beatings were commonplace, but instead the jail would be run in ‘a humane way’. Estimates of the number of French nationals in Syria and Iraq range from 1,000 to 4,000. Earlier this month, two of them – Mickael Dos Santos and Maxime Hauchard – appeared in an IS video showing the decapitated bodies of a US aid worker and 18 Syrian soldiers. In the past two years, two returning French jihadis have been connected with 11 murders. French nationals Mickael Dos Santos, left, and Maxime Hauchard, right, who have appeared in an ISIS video showing the decapitated bodies of a US aid worker and 18 Syrian soldiers . Such atrocities have guaranteed widespread support for Mr Dupont-Aignan’s proposal, with French National Front leader Marine Le Pen saying all returning fighters should be ‘imprisoned for life’. The fear is they will carry out atrocities in mainland Europe, such as those by Al Qaeda-trained killer Mohammed Merah, who shot dead seven people near Toulouse in 2012, and Mehdi Nemmouche, who faces trial for the murder of four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels earlier this year. A French Interior Ministry source in Paris told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Faced with these kind of events, it is no surprise that people are calling for drastic measures.’ The French government said it was aware of the proposal but has not made an official response. The island was the setting for the 1973 film Papillon, which starred Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman . The penal colony closed in 1953 and is now run by the National Centre for Space Studies, a French and European research body. Air Marshal Sir John Walker, Britain’s former head of defence intelligence, said: ‘If the French are wanting to isolate them and stop them spreading their extremist creed, then you do have to separate the jihadis from the mainstream population. You don’t know how far they have been brainwashed and what they have been taught. But reopening Devil’s Island is a high-risk strategy.’ But Lord Carlile QC, the UK’s former terrorism legislation watchdog, called the proposal ‘bonkers’ and a ‘daft idea that would be unlawful in the United Kingdom’. ‘This is a Right-wing idea that one might expect Nigel Farage to come up with,’ he said. ‘But it has no element of responsibility about it.’","Nicolas Dupont-Aignan says island would be a fitting place for 'madmen'

"Sharknado, a spoof movie about sharks on a killing spree on land, became a surprise blockbuster hit last year. But life imitated art (to an extent) when a church group witnessed more than 100 sharks risk beaching themselves in a shoreline attack last week. Members of One Harbor Church filmed the feeding frenzy on the beach at Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina. Feeding frenzy: Over 100 sharks are seen feeding on a school of fish close to shore in North Carolina last week . The sharks came dangerously close to becoming stuck on land in order to feast on a school of blue fish in the shallow surf. The video was shot by Donnie Griggs, who stumbled upon the scene as his church group fished for their evening meal for a camp retreat at noon last Thursday. His friend Brian Recker uploaded the clip to Facebook and YouTube, the latter attracting over 87,000 views in just two days. Too close for comfort: The sharks came dangerously close to becoming beached during their meal . Plenty for everyone: Seagulls and pelicans joined in on the feeding frenzy, which lasted five minutes . Recker wrote on Facebook: 'Donnie Griggs shot this amazing video of the SHARKNADO we saw at Cape Lookout! Not sure what kind exactly they were, but there were over 100 in a feeding frenzy.' 'The men were out fishing for the evening’s dinner when they stumbled across more than 100 sharks attacking a school of blue fish,' Recker added on YouTube. 'As seagulls and pelicans joined in on the meal, the men began to cast into the surf, catching fish without the use of bait. 'For more than five minutes, the sharks were observed swimming in and out of the surf, some of which became beached in the fury. Life imitates art? Satire movie Sharknado was a surprise hit last year . 'Donnie Griggs, the cameraman who captured the footage, is an avid waterman who spearfishes, dives, swims and surfs at Cape Lookout often. Recker said that despite the furious sharks, he believes Cape Lookout to be safe for swimmers, adding that 'the presence of these sharks and large schools of fish is actually a sign of a very healthy ecosystem'. Some commenters on YouTube expressed concern that sharks coming so close to shore to feed is a sign of humans over-fishing in the ocean. Popular beach: Cape Lookout National Seashore is located near the Crystal Coast of North Carolina . Sharknado is a made-for-television film starring Tara Reid and Beverly Hills 90210 star Ian Ziering that became a cult hit when it aired last July on the Syfy channel. The disaster movie satire sees a tornado lift sharks out of the ocean and spitting them out across Los Angeles, where they wreak havoc. It was such a surprise hit that  a sequel was made, Sharknado 2: The Second One, which premiered on July 30. A third film is slated for 2015.","Attack last week at Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina .

"Chillingly life-like robots are causing a storm in Japan – where their creators are about to launch them as actresses, full-size mechanical copies for pop idol fans, and clones of the dearly departed. There is even talk that the naturalistic, even engaging, she-droids may be taken up as men as partners in the not-too-distant future. Android Asuna was a star attraction at Tokyo Designers’ Week showcase earlier this month and she is one of a series of geminoids, as their inventor dubs them, that are ripe for commercialisation say their creator robotics professor Hiroshi Ishiguro. Scroll down for videos . Eerie: Android engineers have recently been able to overcome the 'Uncanny Valley syndrome', where androids elicit a response of revulsion because they look almost, but not quite, human . This is the news: This robot has been deployed to read the news at a Tokyo museum . Gobsmacked men attending the show told MailOnline that she was well made, very convincing and had a nice voice. One man joked that Asuna would make 'a good date; a cheap date!' From others, covering their mouths in astonishment at Asuna’s realistic skin and facial expressions, the frequent response from the public was 'sukoi' which translates as 'amazing' in English. Asuna is so convincing that many bowed respectfully before requesting politely to take her photo or join a selfie. Unable, for now, to use some of the advanced artificial intelligence (AI), face and voice recognition systems that some Japanese robots coming on the market now use, Asuna relies on a camera rigged behind her that is relayed to a remote human controller to give her life. This so-called tele-presence enables Asuna to come alive, taking on the operator’s personality. A fully independent version of the geminoid is expected in 10 years using all the above technologies to make her virtually indistinguishable from humans says Mr. Takeshi Mita, CEO of A-Lab in Tokyo, the company working with Prof. Ishiguro to make Asuna and her kind commercial. 'We already have 20 year's experience making androids in the lab. So in 10 years we will marry AI and life like geminoids in perfection,' he told MailOnline. 'We had been focusing on perfecting her skin, facial expressions, and so on, so for now Asuna is really just a head. Now we are working on her arms and torso to give very natural, fluid body language.' Darling: Asuna was the star attraction at Tokyo Designers’ Week recently where visitors were floored by her . Future: A fully independent version of the geminoid is expected in 10 years to make her virtually indistinguishable from humans depending on developments in artificial intelligence . Everything about Asuna’s appearance has been painstakingly honed to make her more life-like. From the superior quality of her silicon skin to the secret animatronic muscles that move her eyes and drive her facial expressions. Previous attempts by Ishiguro's team had been dismissed as unconvincing and prone to what is known as the 'Uncanny Valley syndrome'. This is a term coined by another Japanese professor of robotics, Masahiro Mori. It describes the response of revulsion and creepiness when faced with something that looks almost, but somehow not quite, human. As robots become as dexterous as Asuna at mimicking humanity, so the theory goes, the syndrome will erase itself. Already Asuna and other androids from A-lab have had a taste of the limelight, appearing on stage and voicing actors lines using tele-presence. Asuna's next performance will be in an opera to prove her credentials as a singer. An Ishiguro geminoid is also appearing on stage in Paris now. 'One application we have is to turn her into an international pop idol,' says Mr. Mita. Already Japan is in thrall to virtual idols such as Hatsune Miku, who is basically a hologram that 'sings' words and music created for her on a computer using 'vocaloid' technology. Her tunes often outsell those sung by her flesh and blood musical rivals in Japan. A-lab also hopes to tap into another big business in Japan - the popularity of fantasy figurines that appeal to Japan’s legions of nerdy men or 'otaku'. Most such dolls are just a few centimetres high and often represent an idol or a manga character often scantily clad. Frenzy: Fembots such as these are causing a storm in Japan at the moment because of recent breakthroughs in technology that have made them so life-like. However some work is still to go on artificial intelligence . Have a nice day: An 'Otonaroid' greets guests to Tokyo’s National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, making unnerving life-like eye contact as she converses while hooked to a tele-presence system . As A-lab is working with highly respected Prof. Ishiguro, Mr. Mita says the company has ruled out producing androids that might be used for sex. But a spokesman working with Ishiguro’s lab says it is not a great leap of imagination to think similar robots, given the advancement in robotics and silicone skin technology, will be used for sex. 'Physical relations will be possible in general with such androids,' said Takahashi Komiyama. 'Androids for the sex industry are a definite possibly. Some have even fallen in love with Ishiguro’s geminoids. So we can't rule those relationships out.' Japan already boasts the world’s most advanced sex dolls from firms such as Kanojotoys or Orient Industries based in Tokyo. Around £6,000 buys the very superior Yasuragi 'dutch wife' sex doll with extras such as movable eyes and flexible fingers and a skin texture its makers say is indistinguishable from the real thing. Lady Gaga was so impressed with their quality that she asked the Japanese firm to make dolls in her own image. 'It is not inconceivable,' said an Orient Industries spokesman, 'that we will be making android life partners in the near future.' David Levy, author of Love and Sex With Robots predicts that as robots become more sophisticated, growing numbers of adventurous humans will enter into intimate relationships with these intelligent robots. Speaking at the First International Conference on Human-Robot Personal Relationships, held last week, he says that AI will progress to the point where human-robot dating will be commonplace. 'Being loved by a robot?' Levy says. 'It sounds a bit weird, but someday, for many, many people, being in love with a robot will be just as good as love with a human. 'Real-life loved ones can also be reproduced faithfully by cloning them to comfort the bereaved', Mr Mita pointed out. These completely unnerving baby-like telenoids are designed to show the minimum required human-like expressions and are most popular at the museum because they straddle the creepy/acceptable barrier . Sexbot: Hyper-real sex dolls are already on sale in Japan. Experts say it won't be long before android versions of them will be manufactured . Androids can now also take on a variety of human jobs such as receptionist and even news readers. To prove the point two fem-bots from Ishiguro’s stable have been working in those posts since June this year at Tokyo’s National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation. The more mature 'Otonaroid' greets guests to the museum, making terrifying life-like eye contact as she converses while hooked to a tele-presence system that the public can also play with. 'Kodomodroid' (child android) is viewable at the museum through an art like installation in an all white room where she sits without rest all day lip-synching the day’s news perfectly from an AI source. They are joined by the most compelling/repelling android of them all who incidentally happens to be the most popular among the Ishiguro droids on show. The thoroughly unnerving baby-like Telenoid, sports a simplistic mannequin head with stunted arms and legs that also speaks by proxy from a control box maned by museum visitors. Confronted with the rather formal reception-droid, Japanese housewife Koari IIda says she couldn’t decide if Otanaroid was human or not. 'If you have talk to her getting closer is a good idea, so she seems more natural and less creepy close up,' she said. 'But it’s great fun robo-chatting.' Asked if she would like Otanaroid at home as a baby sitter if mum was out. Rika replied: 'No, Mum is my robot!'","Incredibly life-like robots are currently causing a storm in Japan where they are being prepared for mass commercialisation .

"It is one of the most amazing selfies ever taken. The Rosetta spacecraft sent back this breathtaking image of itself as it orbited just 16km from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko 297 million miles (478 million km) from Earth. The image was taken on 7 October and captures the side of the Rosetta spacecraft and one of Rosetta's 14 m-long solar wings, with the comet in the background. Scroll down for video . Using the CIVA camera on Rosetta?s Philae lander, the spacecraft has snapped a 'selfie' at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from a distance of about 16 km from the surface of the comet. The Rosetta probe will launch its Philae robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles (10km) to Comet 67P. The 220lb (100kg) lander will reach the surface on 11 November. It will take around seven hours to descend. During the descent, images will be taken and other observations of the comet's environment will be made. Philae will make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace, using screws and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface. Once the lander touches down, it will make a 360° panoramic image of the landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has landed. The lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface, delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis. The interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards Rosetta. Two images with different exposure times were combined to bring out the faint details in this very high contrast situation, ESA said. The comet's active 'neck' region is clearly visible, with streams of dust and gas extending away from the surface. Rosetta has spent 10 years chasing down comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and is now in orbit around the 'ice mountain', edging in closer to its surface each day. For a sense of scale, the comet is about three times the size of Ben Nevis and Rosetta is the size of a car with 105ft (32 metre) wings. This latest image was taken by the CIVA imaging system on board Rosetta’s lander Philae, on 7 October. Not only does the comet appear much larger than in last month's image, the active ‘neck’ region of 67P/C-G is now clearly visible, with streams of dust and gas extending away from the comet. The primary landing site, currently known as Site J, can also be seen on the smaller lobe of the comet. Two images, one with a short exposure time, one with a longer one, were combined to capture the whole dynamic range of the scene, from the bright parts of the solar arrays to the dark comet and the dark insulation cladding the Rosetta spacecraft. CIVA, the Comet Infrared and Visible Analyser, is one of ten instruments on-board Philae. The CIVA-P part of the instrument comprises seven micro-cameras arranged around the top of the lander to take panorama images, while CIVA-M is a visible/infrared microscope imager/spectrometer that will the study the composition, texture, and albedo of surface samples. The 7 October selfie is the last image from Philae before the lander separates from Rosetta on 12 November, ESA said. The next image will be taken by CIVA shortly after separation, when the lander will look back at the orbiter to bid it a final farewell. Rosetta took another  incredible selfie of its 131ft (40 metre) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last week, when it was 50km away. In the background is the duck-shaped comet, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with its distinct 'head' and 'body' clearly visible . The camera will be tasked with making a 360 degree panoramic image of the landing site, including a section in stereo, once safely on the surface of 67P/C-G. The images and other data collected by Philae will provide important in situ information about this particular region on the comet, providing ‘ground truth’ data that can be used to complement the data collected for the whole comet from the Rosetta orbiter now and into 2015, as the comet becomes more active. Last month a 2.4 mile-wide (4km) region on the 'head' of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was revealed as the spot for the daring landing of Rosetta's Philae probe. The high-risk manoeuvre on November 11, if successful, will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet. Scientists at mission control in Germany hope the spider-like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of Earth's water and perhaps even life. But they've warned that the landing should be seen as an 'exciting extra' on the Rosetta mission as the mission carries a 'high risk'. The Rosetta probe will launch its Philae robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles (10km) to Comet 67P. The 220lb (100kg) lander will reach the surface on 11 November. It will take around seven hours to descend. During the descent, images will be taken and other observations of the comet's environment will be made.

"The prospect of a British bombing campaign against ISIS fanatics in Iraq took a step closer today after Ed Miliband suggested Labour could back airstrikes without official UN backing. The Labour leader said a military assault on the terror group needed regional and global support and ‘a base in international law’. But he stopped short of demanding a full UN resolution authorising military action. Mr Miliband’s remarks come as David Cameron prepares to travel to New York to urge world leaders at the UN to tackle the ISIS terrorists slaughtering civilians across the Middle East. Labour leader Ed Miliband did not rule out backing military action against ISIS during an interview with Andrew Marr at the BBC's Media City in Salford this morning . There is increasing speculation that Parliament may be recalled on Thursday after the Labour Party conference to authorise airstrikes. The Prime Minister needs Labour support to pass a Commons motion giving him the authority to join a US-led bombing campaign. Mr Cameron will meet President Barack Obama at the UN and could formally be asked to join airstrikes aimed at ""degrading and destroying"" Isis. The PM will use his speech at the UN to accelerate the formation of a coalition to fight Isis. ""He will talk about the need to act and the importance of an international response to tackle their poisonous ideology,"" said a senior Downing Street source. Britain will also join America in passing a UN security council resolution urging all countries to tackle the problem of foreign fighters travelling abroad to join the terrorists. ISIS released a video of British journalist John Cantlie following the murder of fellow captive David Haines. UK aid worker Alan Henning has also been threatened . America has already carried out more than . 170 airstrikes against Isis targets in Iraq and was joined for the first . time by French jets in attacks on Friday. Britain has . signalled a willingness to become involved in an air campaign in Iraq . but has reservations about taking action in neighbouring Syria. Michael . Fallon, the defence secretary, will travel to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain . this week to build up support for military action against Isis. Speaking . on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show this morning, Mr Miliband said he would . weigh up any proposal for military action – but suggested he was . prepared to back airstrikes. Islamic State fighters are marauding across vast swathes of the Middle East, butchering civilians including Yazidi and Shia minorities . Chilling Isis propaganda videos showing bloodied corpses  are being posted online by British jihadists . He . said: ‘ISIL is a murderous organisation. And their barbaric acts not . just against British people but also the Christians, Yazidis and so on . shock us all. ‘My . judgement about this is that we’ve got to make sure that we assemble . the alliance right across the world – including in the region – to . counter them. ‘The means action in Iraq to include the Sunni minorities who’ve often felt excluded. It means mobilising the region.’ He added that it should have a ‘base in international law’ and have ‘clear objectives’. Creeping influence: A map showing the areas under complete or partial control of the Islamic State . He said: ‘As a person who wants to be the Prime Minister in eight months, I am going to judge any proposal that comes forward on those criteria. ‘We opposed action in Syria because we didn’t feel it met those criteria. That was about chemical weapons and in fact there was another way of dealing with those chemical weapons. They have now largely been dealt with.’ He added: ‘We’ve got to test any decision to take military action against a criteria I’ve set out. We’ve learnt the lessons of the Iraq war – which is that military action has to be a last resort.’ ‘It’s definitely got to have a base in international law. You’ve got to make sure, in any action that you take that you have that regional and international support.

"Just a week after Australian-born ginger jihadist Abdullah Elmir appeared in a propaganda video released by Islamic State, the teenager has resurfaced in another. The 17-year-old, who grew up in Bankstown in Sydney's west, is seen in the latest video on the banks of the river Tigris, surrounded by dozens of men dressed in black wielding weapons. The production, titled An Evening On The Banks Of The Tigris River In The Province Of Nineveh In The Islamic State, is more than six minutes long and shows throngs of militants praying and chanting. Scroll down for video . Australian-born Abdullah Elmir (left) has appeared in a second ISIS propoganda video . Opening on scenes of men  in groups and cleansing in the Tigris River, the piece shows others praying in lines inside what could be a tent, weapons still strapped to their chests. Throughout the piece  various men address the group, reciting chants they appear to be reading from some sort of script. At other times the men are shown sharing a meal together as they cross the river in a barge. Those listening will then repeat parts of the chant back at the speaker, and it is one of these scenes that Abdullah Elmir appears. The teenager is wearing the same black and white keffiyeh he was seen in the previous video, and is flanking a man speaking to the group. The 17-year-old sits next to a man who is chanting in Arabic . At some points the teenager, who grew up in Bankstown in Sydney's west, appears to stifle a smile or laughter . At one point Elmir seems to stifle a smile or laughter as he looks down, away from the camera while repeating a chant. His eyes dart around as he listens to one of the other militants speak, and the video looks to have been produced to exhibit comradery and unity of the Islamic State fighters. While most of the video is in Arabic, The Australian report that some of the speakers said in the footage they will: ' will strike the necks of the infidel and Arab countries'. This comes after the government said they would be willing to work with young Australians who had gone to fight in the Middle East but changed their minds before entering battle. Just last week Elmir appeared in a chilling video where he condemned Barack Obama and Tony Abbott . He fled Sydney in June, telling his mother he was going on a fishing trip but instead boarding a flight to the Middle East . A spokeswoman for the Attorney General George Brandis told the publication they wanted 'impressionable youth' to be able to work with Australian authorities, but more serious offenders would be prosecuted back home. Earlier this week reports Elmir could face 25 years behind bars should he ever return to Australian soil emerged. AFP counterterrorism head Neil Gaughan told the Herald Sun that Elmir, who now goes by the moniker Abu Khaled, has 'basically admitted he is a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation'. In the latest footage Elmir is seen in the same keffiyeh as last week's and is still clutching a large gun . 'The fact that he is admitting that he is a member of ISIS, which he does in the video, straight away says that he has committed an offence under the criminal code. That’s up to 25 years imprisonment,' he said. Professor Greg Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, said Elmir was recruited by another wanted terrorist, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, an Australian based in Syria. He said terror recruiters lured targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators. He said the boy appeared as a 'pawn in the machine' in the first chilling video. This comes as Australian authorities have warned that anyone returning from fighting overseas will be thrown in jail back home .","Abdullah Elmir has appeared in a second Islamic State propaganda video .

"A new video has emerged showing heavily armed Islamic State fighters stalking backstreets in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane while American warplanes circle overhead. The footage, which emerged on social media accounts linked to the terror group, shows jihadists wandering rubble-lined roads and entering destroyed buildings while the sound of intense gun fights is heard nearby. The video emerged as fierce street battles broke out yesterday - the first significant fighting in the city since the majority of ISIS' militants were pushed back into the suburbs two days ago by the most intense coalition bombing raids of the past few weeks. The clashes came as desperate ISIS jihadists launched a final assault 'on all fronts' to take the town yesterday, after the militants felt the full force of American air power with sustained bombing raids resulting in a series of spectacular explosions in the besieged Syrian town. Scroll down for video . Armed: Groups of Islamic State militants are seen stalking the Kobane backstreets, wandering from building to building as the sound of intense fighting is heard nearby . Threat: The video begins by showing an American warplane circling overhead while ISIS militants can be heard chanting religious slogans and asking God to keep them safe . Campaign: The militants enter partially-destroyed factories, where makeshift bedding (left) can be seen against graffiti-daubed walls - suggesting the rooms are being used to house militants while they besiege the town . The video begins by showing an American warplane circling overhead while ISIS militants can be heard chanting religious slogans and asking God to keep them safe. Masked men are then seen stalking the Kobane backstreets, wandering from building to building as the sound of intense fighting is heard nearby. The militants enter partially-destroyed factories, where makeshift bedding can be seen against the walls - suggesting the rooms are being used to house militants while they besiege the town. Militants, some of them not wearing masks, are then interviewed on camera and describe in Arabic their brutal efforts to seize the town from its largely Kurdish population. The extremists have been dramatically pushed back from the town in recent days, having as recently as last week looked like it was about to drive out the last of the brave Kurdish fighters defending it. As a fresh round of airstrikes rained down earlier this week, the US also ran a series of airdrops for the Kurdish resistance, dispatching weapons and medical supplies. Rubble: The ISIS militants are seen wandering in and out of badly damaged buildings throughout the video clip . Campaign: The video show Islamic State militants, some  not wearing masks,  being interviewed on camera and describing in Arabic their brutal efforts to seize Kobane from its largely Kurdish population . The video of militants wandering around inside Kobane comes as it emerged ISIS has seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish troops fighting the terrorists in Kobane. Footage released by the terror group shows a masked militant inspecting cases packed with hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, prompting the U.S. state department to announce it is investigating the video's authenticity. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which gathers its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache. However analysts have questioned the footage, saying the weapons in the film are not U.S. standard issue and suggesting ISIS may have faked the scenario using arms already in their possession in order to make the American military appear incompetent. ISIS militants have been largely pushed out of Kobane this week thanks to sustained American airstrikes . Smoke rises over Kobane after an American warplane drops bombs on Islamic State-held buildings . Kurds in southern Turkey gather on a hilltop overlooking Kobane to watch the fighting at sunset yesterday . ISIS loyalists took to social media to post sarcastic thank you notes to the United States after the release of the video, including one image that said 'Team USA.' But if the weapons in the footage prove to be authentic, the situation is more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. ISIS already possesses millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June. The U.S. Central Command yesterday said American military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobane that destroyed ISIS fighting positions, an ISIS-controlled building and a large ISIS unit. The video of militants wandering around inside Kobane comes as it emerged ISIS has seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish troop in Kobane . A still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey border . Meanwhile the Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan yesterday, killing at least eight people. Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble. The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border. The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area. Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria. A young convert to Islam who killed a Canadian soldier in a hit-and-run had been on the radar of federal investigators, who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey, authorities said Tuesday. Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney said the attack Monday was 'clearly linked to terrorist ideology.' Quebec Police spokesman Guy Lapointe said the act was deliberate and that one of the two soldiers was in uniform. Police said the suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, called 911 to report his hit-and-run as police chased him in the Quebec city of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu. He later was shot dead by police after his car flipped over into a ditch and he brandished a knife as he exited his car. A second soldier suffered minor injuries in the attack. Three teenage girls from suburban Denver may have been trying to join Islamic State militants in Syria after stealing their parents' money and flying to Germany, authorities said Tuesday. The girls — two sisters, ages 17 and 15, and their 16-year-old friend — were reported missing after they skipped school Friday, but the families had no indication of where they might have gone, said Glenn Thompson, bureau chief of the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Department . Suspicion arose when the sisters' father realized his daughters were gone, along with $2,000 and their passports. They were stopped at the Frankfurt, Germany, airport over the weekend by FBI agents and returned to Colorado where they were reunited with their families, an FBI spokeswoman said.","Footage shows militants wandering from building to building in Kobane .

"Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton accepted a $225,000 speaking fee Monday night from a university where she said young Americans should be able to afford college without incurring massive debt. The check will be cashed by Clinton's family foundation – not by the politician herself – but angry students at the University of Nevada Las Vegas complained earlier this year that the money should have been devoted to scholarships instead. UNLV tuition has nearly tripled since 2004 and is slated to go up 4 per cent for each of the next four years. Student loan debt 'can feel like an anchor tied to their feet dragging them down,' Clinton said of students on Monday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND CLINTON'S SPEAKING CONTRACT . Hillary Rodham Clinton was presented with a shoe during the UNLV Foundation annual dinner on Monday as a joking gesture from Las Vegas Sun CEO Brian Greenspun. A woman threw a shoe at Clinton during a separate Las Vegas appearance in April - and is she going to run for president? 'I think our young people deserve a fair shot,' she told about 900 people gathered at the swanky Bellagio resort for the annual UNLV Foundation dinner. The 1-1/2-hour commitment netted Mrs. Clinton a cool $2,500 per minute. UNLV student Jordan Mason told MailOnline in June that a nearly quarter-million-dollar payday for Clinton should have been out of the question. '$225,000? That's obscene!' Mason said. 'And the money is all fungible, right? Even if some CEO is writing the check, that's money that the person probably would have given to the university in some other way.' 'I like Hillary,' the student added, 'but if she's not willing to support us without all that money changing hands, maybe they should book someone else who won't add to the reasons we're paying more for school.' Elias Benjelloun, UNLV’s undergraduate student body president, told the Las Vegas Sun this summer that the school's trustees were trying to improve its offerings 'on the backs of students.' Clinton's speaking contract originally required UNLV to close the event to the press. But last week she relented. Recordings were strictly forbidden, however. The $200 per plate dinner included some attendees paying as much as $20,000 for special sponsorships that included a private photo session with the guest of honor. The UNLV Foundation earned 49 million in its last fiscal year and ended up with $228 million in assets, according to its publicly available tax return. Clinton also addressed the American public's possible reluctance to get involved in conflicts around the world,  referring to the threats posed by the Ebola virus and the ISIS terror army. 'They want to bring the fight to Europe and the fight to the United States,' she said of the terrorist group. Clinton caught grief from UNLV students when the terms of her pricey contract were leaked since tuition at the school has tripled in the last decade . And Ebola is not going to stay confined, the former first lady said. 'We can't say we're not going to be involved because these things are other people's problems,' she said. The remarks were part of questions from longtime friend and Las Vegas Sun Publisher Brian Greenspun after Clinton's prepared speech. In her talk, she touched on her thoughts on Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying, 'I see a very cold-blooded, calculated former KGB agent who is determined to not only enrich himself and his closest colleagues but also to try to revive Russia's influence around its border.' She mentioned the most important person she's ever met – Nelson Mandela for his 'level of self-awareness and political skill.' Clinton added that her most difficult decision as secretary of State was 'whether or not to go after [Osama] bin Laden based on the evidence we had.' That decision was ultimately made by President Barack Obama and his military leaders at the Pentagon. Before the questions, Greenspun presented her with a gift: a pair of Nike athletic shoes, a reference to one of her last appearances in Las Vegas in April when a woman in the crowd threw a shoe at Clinton. 'How do we make amends?' he asked. By giving her two shoes instead of just the one. Playing coy: Asked if she's running for president, Hillary would only say: 'I'm really going to have to ponder that seriously' ISIS warning: 'They want to bring the fight to Europe and the fight to the United States,' she said . Greenspun pointed out the pair came from the 'running' shoes section, a coy reference to speculation surrounding a possible presidential run by Clinton. She didn't give anything away about her future plans after Greenspun pressed a second time about any unfinished business she might have and how she would finish it, a reference to a chapter in her book, 'Hard Choices.' 'I'm really going to have to ponder that seriously,' she said. Before Monday's event, Clinton made a stop in Denver to campaign for Colorado Sen. Mark Udall and later appeared at a Nevada Democratic Party fundraiser in Las Vegas with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. The Las Vegas Sun reported that VIP tickets to the fundraiser at the Aria resort cost $10,000 each. The UNLV Foundation dinner also honored billionaire Republican fundraiser and Sands Corp. CEO Sheldon Adelson. Despite the political chasm separating them, Clinton commended Adelson for his donations to the university. The casino-hotel mogul's Las Vegas Sands has committed $7 million to fund construction of Hospitality Hall for the university's Harrah Hotel College and a proposed Center for Professional and Leadership Studies.

"A reported 70 senior Syrian army officers were beheaded when members of  ISIS and the Al-Nusra front launched simultaneous attacks on army checkpoints, police headquarters, and the governor's office in northwestern Syria . The attacks all took place in the city of Idlib, activists and state media reported. The city, which is in Syrian government hands, is the local capital of Idlib province. The men were believed to have been beheaded before government troops could recapture the building and save them. Scroll down for video . Grim toll: A reported 70 senior Syrian army officers were beheaded when members of ISIS and the Al-Nusra front launched simultaneous attacks in the city of Idlib. File picture . Rebels on their way to battle in this file picture. Yesterday's attacks were the most serious there since Syrian rebels took control of scores of villages and towns around Idlib more than two years ago . Monday's attacks were the most serious there since Syrian rebels took control of scores of villages and towns around it more than two years ago. The fighting is separate from the clashes underway between Nusra Front's main rebel rivals, ISIS, and Syrian Kurdish fighters for control of the strategic border town of Kobane, further to the east and along the border with Turkey. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Nusra Front and other groups shelled Idlib and simultaneously attacked army checkpoints there. It said four Nusra Front members blew themselves up inside the city, targeting checkpoints there and causing casualties among the troops. The fighting is separate from the clashes underway between Nusra Front's main rebel rivals, ISIS (pictured), and Syrian Kurdish fighters for control of the strategic border town of Kobane . 'It was a moral blow to the regime,' said activist Asad Kanjo, based in the town of Saraqeb, also in Idlib province. He added that calm had been restored in the city. Syria's pro-government Al-Ikhbariya TV cited the provincial police chief, who was not named, as saying the attackers took advantage of a power cut before dawn to hit the checkpoints and also the governor's office. He added that troops repelled the attackers. 'There isn't one gunman in the city now,' said the police chief. The TV later aired footage from Idlib showing bodies of two purported attackers with suicide vests. Syrian state TV said government forces repelled the attack on Idlib and that a 'large number of terrorists' were killed . The Observatory said the rebels were helped by some policemen who were protecting the police command and the governor's office enter the two buildings. The buildings were retaken later by government troops. Another activist in Idlib province, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said most of the attacks took place on the southern edge of the city, near Mastoumeh Hill. The Observatory said the hill was captured by rebels, which prompted Syrian helicopter gunships to target the site. It said 15 rebels and 20 soldiers were killed at the hill. Syrian state TV said government forces repelled the attack on Idlib and that a 'large number of terrorists' were killed. The government refers to the rebels as terrorists. State TV said the attackers were led by Abu Waleed al-Libi who was killed in the battle - al-Libi is Arabic for 'the Libyan'. The Observatory said that some of the Nusra Front members killed in the fighting were foreigners. In the eastern province of Deir el-Zour a car bomb exploded near a hospital run by ISIS killing four people including a child and wounding others, the Observatory said. The explosion in the town of Mayadeen caused material damage to the hospital and nearby homes. Syrian state TV said the blast in Mayadeen occurred outside a medical centre run by the Islamic State group. The channel said there are reports of 20 people killed by the blast. The state channel and the Observatory gave no further details. The Islamic State group controls wide areas of the oil-rich Deir el-Zour province, where some tribesmen rose against the extremist group but were quickly crushed. In Kobane, an Associated Press journalist on the Turkish side of the border said there was intense fighting in the town Monday. Sporadic explosions and occasional cracks of gunfire could be heard from a distance.","ISIS and the Al-Nusra front launched simultaneous attacks in Idlib .

"Not good: Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned that the leak of top secret documents proving government oversight over personal records could cause serious national security issues . The top U.S. intelligence official denounced the disclosure of highly secret documents Thursday and sought to set the record straight about how the government collects intelligence about people's telephone and Internet use. He said he was declassifying some aspects of the monitoring to help Americans understand it better. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper called the disclosure of an Internet surveillance program 'reprehensible' and said it risks Americans' security. He said a leak that revealed a program to collect phone records would affect how America's enemies behave and make it harder to understand their intentions. 'The unauthorized disclosure of a top secret U.S. court document threatens potentially long-lasting and irreversible harm to our ability to identify and respond to the many threats facing our nation,' Clapper said in an unusual late-night statement. At the same time, he moved to correct misunderstandings about both programs, taking the rare step of declassifying some details about the authority used in the phone records program and alleging that articles about the Internet program 'contain numerous inaccuracies.' He did not specify what those inaccuracies might be. At issue is a court order, first disclosed Wednesday by The Guardian newspaper in Britain, that requires the communications company Verizon to turn over on an 'ongoing, daily basis' the records of its customers' calls. Separately, The Washington Post and The Guardian reported Thursday the existence of another program used by the NSA and FBI that scours the nation's main Internet companies, extracting audio, video, emails and other information. Spying: The NSA has been getting millions of phone records from Verizon on a daily basis for months without any justification for the order, that was only revealed today . 'The unauthorized disclosure of a top secret U.S. court document threatens potentially long-lasting and irreversible harm to our ability to identify and respond to the many threats facing our nation,' Clapper said Thursday . Clapper said the Internet program, known as PRISM, can't be used to intentionally target any Americans or anyone in the U.S. He said a special court, Congress and the executive branch all oversee the program and that extensive procedures make sure the acquisition, retention and dissemination of data accidentally collected about Americans is kept to a minimum. He added that Congress recently reauthorized the section of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that authorizes such a program. 'Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats,' Clapper said. Clapper acknowledged the risks inherent in publicly discussing details about the phone records program but said he wanted to correct the 'misleading impression' created by the article that disclosed its existence. Double bind: Part of the order mandated that Verizon not tell its' customer's about the record transfer nor could they admit that the order existed . 'I believe it is important for the . American people to understand the limits of this targeted . counterterrorism program and the principles that govern its use.' To that end, Clapper said he was . immediately declassifying and releasing to the public certain details . about the FISA provision that governs the program. A special panel known as the FISA . Court authorizes the phone records program and reviews it about every 90 . days, Clapper said, adding that the Justice Department oversees . information acquired under the court order and that members of Congress . have been fully and repeatedly briefed. He said only a small fraction of the . records collected ever get examined because most are unrelated to any . inquiries into terrorism activities. The NSA collects the phone data in . broad swaths, Clapper said, because collecting it a narrow fashion would . make it harder to identify terrorism-related communications. Wide-reaching: Millions of Verizon customers had their data turned over to the NSA, and it is not known whether similar orders were given to other phone companies as well . Lashing out: Former Vice President Al Gore called the surveillance 'outrageous', not supporting his fellow Democrats . Timing: The revelation comes the same day as President Obama announced his appointment of Susan Rice (right) to be the new head of the NSA, replacing Tom Donilon (center) He said the information collected lets . the government, over time, make connections about terrorist activities. He said the program doesn't let the U.S. listen to people's calls, but . only includes information like call length and telephone numbers dialed. The court also prohibits the . government from indiscriminately rummaging through the phone data, which . he said can only be queried when there are specific facts to back up a . reasonable suspicion of an association with a foreign terrorist group. He says officials allowed to access the records must be specially cleared and are trained in the court-approved procedures. Clapper also cited the USA Patriot Act . and noted both the Obama and Bush administrations had reauthorized the . provision used to grant authority to the program. That provision deals . with the ability to compel an entity to hand over business records. Warning: Senators Mark Udall (left) and Ron Wyden (right) wrote a letter warning the Attorney General that there would be public outcry should the government's actions become public . When the first revelation in the case came out Wednesday night about the order against Verizon, The American Civil Liberties Union . put out an immediate statement calling for an end to the program - which . is scheduled to run until July 19 - and a investigation into the order. 'From a civil liberties perspective, . the program could hardly be any more alarming,' ACLU deputy legal . director Jameel Jaffer said in a statement. 'It’s a program in which some untold . number of innocent people have been put under the constant surveillance . of government agents. 'It is beyond Orwellian, and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.' The order is the first concrete evidence that U.S. intelligence officials are continuing a broad campaign of domestic surveillance that began under President George W. Bush and caused great controversy when it was first exposed. In 2005, the New York Times reported that the NSA was wiretapping Americans without warrants on international calls. Los Angeles Times and USA Today later reported that the agency also had unchecked access to records on domestic calls. In addition, a former AT&T technician, Mark Klein, said that a room accessible only with NSA clearance in the carrier's main San Francisco hub received perfect copies of all transmissions. Verizon is the second biggest U.S. telephone company behind AT&T in terms of revenue. The vast majority of Verizon's overseas operations come from its acquisition of MCI Communications, which is also covered by the order although foreign-to-foreign calls are exempted from it.","A copy of a secret order shows that the National Security Agency ordered Verizon to hand over millions of phone records with no explanation .

"A dozen years after 3-year-old Rosita Gonzalez's death, her alleged killer has still not been brought to justice. The toddler died on October 15, 2002, just one day after being admitted to the hospital for vomiting and seizures. Doctors reported her symptoms to the police, saying they were consistent water intoxication, and the finger of blame fell on babysitter Nancy Gayoso, now 45. Twelve years later, Gayoso has still not been brought to trial and remains free on bond thanks to several delays in her case. Too young: Twelve years after the death of 3-year-old Rosita Gonzalez, her accused killer still has not been tried in court . This has left Gonazlez's mother Carmen Saldarriago Pinedo unable to heal from the incredibly traumatic experience of losing a child. 'There is no justice. It's been 12 years that I've lived in frustration,' Pinedo told the Sun-Sentinel. In 2002, Pinedo was a single mother renting a room in Gayoso's Hollywood, Florida home. When Gayoso offered to take care of little Rosita while her mother worked clearing tables at a Peruvian restaurant, Pinedo accepted. Killer? Babysitter Nancy Gayoso, now 45 (pictured), is suspected of forcing Rosita to drink nearly a gallon of water in just a four hour period . After Rosita's untimely death, the medical examiner ruled it a homicide, saying the girl had been forced to ingest nearly a gallon of water in the four hours before she was hospitalized. That caused her sodium levels to drop and her brain to swell, sending her into shock and shutting down her vital organs. During those four hours, Rosita was in the care of Gayoso, though she says the little girl ingested the water herself, while taking a bath. Because forced water intoxication is such an uncommon accusation, it took five months to bring up charges against Gayoso and she was eventually arrested in April 2003.  She spent one month in jail before being freed on bond. Then, from 2004 to 2007 the case was again delayed after Gayoso was deemed  mentally unfit to stand trial . In January 2010 the case hit another road bump when her defense attorney dropped out. However, defense attorney Luara Chukwuma, to this day believes in her former client's innocence. 'Nancy is innocent, no doubt about that,' Chukwuma said. 'She is completely innocent, she is a good woman … she can't hurt a fly.' Due to a change in Florida law, Gayoso is now facing much less prison time if convicted. Initially she was charged with first-degree murder, with aggravated child abuse as the underlying cause, which carries a maximum of life in prison sentence. But those charges have now been downgraded to aggravated manslaughter due to a tweak in the law which requires a pattern of abuse to prove aggravated child abuse. Now she faces only a maximum of 30 years in prison. However, it appears the trial may soon take place since March 1 marks the cut-off date for any remaining depositions, expert testimony or evidence in the case. And that's good news for Pinedo, who can finally see justice in the case of her daughter, who would be 15 today had she survived. 'There is no way to describe this loss because there is nothing in the world that is more horrid than for a mother to lose a child,' Pinedo says. Now 43, Pinedo has since married and is mother to her 11-year-old twins and a 20-year-old stepdaughter.","Rosita Gonzalez died on October 15, 2002 one day after being hospitalized for symptoms of forced water intoxication .

Minnesota Vikings' star running back Adrian Peterson has sparked anger - after appearing to compare his child abuse charges to the situation unfolding in Ferguson, Missouri . Peterson took to Twitter after a grand jury decided not to indict police officer Darren Wilson over the fatal shooting of unarmed Michael Brown . The remarks prompted a backlash from Twitter users with one writing, 'This is gonna get taken down real quick by your PR guy'. Twitter user Michael G.

Peterson pleaded no contest in a Texas courtroom to a misdemeanor assault charge following his arrest and was told to pay a $4,000 (£2,550) fine and perform community service. The child, who has not been named, was left with cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and one of his testicles, according to court records. He was later suspended without pay for at least the remainder of the 2014 NFL season. Shortly after his Tweet today, he posted another message which said: 'Others may misunderstand my good intentions, judge my words or deeds, find fault in what they truly do not understand. 'But God Knows my heart. He knows I am learning, trying.' The star running back posted a further Tweet a short time later after an earlier one had sparked outrage .

"UEFA have confirmed that Manchester City's £50million fine for breaching financial fair play rules will be shared out around the other clubs in the Champions League. The first payments from City, Paris St Germain and Zenit St Petersburg (the other clubs who broke FFP rules last season) will total £20million. They will be split among the Champions League and Europa League clubs who did comply with the rules last season, including Premier League rivals Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United. Expensive: Last summer's spending spree saw City buy Negredo and Navas on the way to the title . Still spending: The Etihad outfit have continued to purchase high profile stars since being fined . City were fined £50million for the FFP breaches but will only have to pay around £20million if they comply with the break-even rules in future seasons. A similar sum will be distributed to clubs who comply with the FFP rules in this season's European competitions. European Clubs' Association chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said UEFA had agreed the fines should go to the other clubs. He told a news conference in Geneva last week: 'It was an agreement between UEFA and the clubs that it was money belonging to the clubs.' The clubs will have a chance to argue any changes to FFP rules at a meeting with UEFA on October 13. Advantage: The money City have been fined will be redistributed to other Champions League clubs . Paying power: Despite staying within the constraints Arsenal managed to buy Alexis Sanchez from Barca . UEFA president Michel Platini said in his speech to the ECA: 'The framework for financial fair play must be dynamic, it must evolve constantly, which is why I have convened an important round table on the subject with your representatives at UEFA headquarters on 13 October.

"Chris Grayling has accused his opponents of being out of touch with the ‘wishes of the country’, as Tory plans to end the meddling of the European Court of Human Rights came under ferocious attack. The Justice Secretary faced down criticism of his proposal to allow Britain to ignore rulings by the Strasbourg court from the Lib Dems, ex-Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve and former justice secretary Ken Clarke. Labour went so far as to warn that the Tories wished to put Britain on a par with Belarus – which commits human rights abuses and imposes the death penalty. Chris Grayling has accused his opponents of being out of touch with the ‘wishes of the country’ Meanwhile the ECHR indicated Mr Grayling’s plan to restore the sovereignty of the British Parliament and our courts would not be acceptable. The Council of Europe, which oversees the Strasbourg court, said: ‘As they stand, the proposals are not consistent with the ECHR.’ This immediate rejection of the plans will harden attitudes and could push Britain one step closer to proposing an exit from the court if the Tories win a Parliamentary majority in May. Mr Grayling, who repeated his threat to quit the ECHR if Strasbourg does not agree to the changes, was defiant. The plans provoked fury from civil liberties groups and Dominic Grieve QC, who was sacked by David Cameron in the summer reshuffle . He said: ‘Politicians should reflect the wishes of the country. I do not claim to understand why the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats are opposed to change. The vast majority – 80, 90 per cent of the public – support this change.’ As the Mail revealed yesterday, the Tories will make a manifesto commitment to scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. Instead of being bound by rulings from the European Court, it will serve in an ‘advisory’ capacity. Any verdict which was not in Britain’s interests could be rejected by MPs in a Parliamentary vote. As expected, the plans provoked fury from civil liberties groups and Mr Grieve QC, who was sacked by David Cameron in the summer reshuffle. Mr Grieve said it was ‘laughable’ that Britain would be able to negotiate its own set of rules with Strasbourg and criticised the plans as ‘almost puerile’. He told The Guardian: ‘I also think they are unworkable and will damage the UK’s international reputation.’ The Council of Europe said it was ‘inconceivable’ that the UK, as a founding member, could leave the court, he said. He claimed the Tory proposals ‘lack any maturity’, complaining: ‘How can the UK obtain such a status when other countries have signed up to an agreement collectively to implement judgments?’ But Tory sources pointed out that, while he was still serving on the Conservative front bench, Mr Grieve had appeared to take a different position – supporting the idea MPs could vote against the European Court’s demand for prisoners to be granted the vote. In 2009, Mr Grieve said: ‘The Government must allow a Parliamentary debate which gives MPs the opportunity to insist on retaining our existing practice that convicted prisoners can’t vote.’ Four years earlier, when the verdict on prisoner voting was first handed down, the QC said of the Court: ‘Why should they have a say in how that society is run?’ Mr Clarke said he found the idea of giving MPs a veto on rulings by the court ‘rather bewildering’. He said the Russian government would ‘welcome the idea’ that its Parliament could set them all aside. Russian membership of the human rights body has continued despite Moscow’s arming of separatist rebels and effective invasion of Ukraine this year. Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat justice minister, indicated the move was an attempt to counter the threat from Ukip. He said: ‘The Conservatives don’t care about the rights of British citizens – they care about losing to Ukip. These plans make no sense: you can’t protect the human rights of Brits and pull out of the system that protects them. ‘We will not allow the Tories to take away the hard-won human rights of British people when in the UK or anywhere else in Europe.’ There was also anger about Labour’s claim that, if Britain no longer falls under the jurisdiction of Strasbourg, it will be ‘in the same bracket as Belarus, Europe’s last remaining dictatorship’. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘For Labour to suggest Britain would descend to Belarus without their Human Rights Act shows a wanton lack of moral clarity.’ Belarus is widely condemned as an authoritarian dictatorship with tight restrictions on freedoms of speech, association and regular crackdowns on dissent. Britain, by contrast, invented modern Parliamentary democracy, has a centuries old tradition of civil and political rights and a strong, independent Press and judiciary.","Tories want to strip European court of power to enforce human rights in UK .

"Sipping cappuccinos by the pool of the striking Fasano hotel in Rio de Janeiro last summer, Rio Ferdinand couldn’t wait to get back to work. His voice was crackling with excitement. It was there, during a break between matches at the World Cup in Brazil, when he admitted that the performances of Arjen Robben and James Rodriguez had whetted his appetite for the game once more. Just three months have passed since he returned to start pre-season training with his new club QPR. He will be wondering whether it is all worth it. Rio Ferdinand is no longer a first choice at QPR after making a slow start to life after Manchester United . The former England captain had decided to continue his career despite leaving Old Trafford last summer . Nearly 36, Ferdinand is no longer first choice in the Rangers team and has just been banned by the FA for three games, fined £25,000 and ordered to attend an education course. When he left Manchester United last season, he could have pursued a promising broadcasting career with BT and the BBC, or branched out into fashion and retail with his #5 clothing and magazine range. Instead he wanted one more season on the field, driving into QPR’s rough and ready Harlington training ground each day from his enormous family home in Kent to smell the dressing-room atmosphere once again. Ferdinand recently released another autobiography, #2sides, which included criticism of the management techniques used by David Moyes in his short spell as United manager. A few days after its release, along with the subsequent publicity around the farrago over Moyes’ decision to ban chips, Ferdinand was in the QPR team beaten 4-0 at United. Ferdinand could have bowed out of Premier League football at the top, but wanted one more season . The QPR defender was part of the BBC's World Cup coverage in Brazil last summer . Ferdinand has also worked as a pundit for BT Sport, but chose another season playing over a media career . Still, he was given a tremendous reception, with chants of ‘Rio, Rio’ ringing around the stands when he walked out with his new team just before kick-off. He won six Barclays Premier League titles, the Champions League and the World Club Cup during his glittering career at the Theatre of Dreams. This season has turned into a nightmare. There are very few players who have left Old Trafford in the autumn of their careers and gone on to be a success at their next club. Most simply retire. When the legs went, Paul Scholes (twice), Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville, who all enjoyed stellar careers at United, went out at the very top. Others, such as Roy Keane (Celtic), Denis Irwin (Wolves), Gary Pallister (Middlesbrough), and Brian McClair (Motherwell), had limited success after they were shown the door by Sir Alex Ferguson. Keane, in his recently-released book The Second Half, admits he should never have moved to Celtic Park after Ferguson kicked him out of Old Trafford in 2005. Ferdinand won 81 England caps, and was named captain by Fabio Capello before the 2010 World Cup . Few players have continued to achieve success after leaving Old Trafford and Ferdinand is struggling . Ferdinand’s great friend Frank Lampard, now 36, is enjoying a remarkable loan spell with Manchester City and was voted the fans' player of the month in September. No-one, though, really wants to admit that they are done with football at the very highest level. Ferdinand is the same. The former England international wanted to work with Harry Redknapp, the man who gave him his first-team debut at West Ham in 1996, for one more season before he called it quits. It has not gone so well. He has been nailed by the FA this week, taken to the cleaners for using the word ‘sket’ — street-slang for a promiscuous woman — in a foolish exchange on Twitter. Ferdinand, a prominent and respected member of the football community, ought to have known better than to react, but Twitter is the wild west; provocation and abuse are rife. He should be a statesman of the game, a beacon for every budding young player trying to make their way into professional football. Ferdinand six Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA World Club Cup while at United . On Monday evening, when he sat on the substitutes’ bench for the second successive QPR match at Loftus Road, it was sad to see one of the game’s great players looking on. It must have been a tough decision for Redknapp to leave him out of the team to face Liverpool, a game they lost 3-2, but Ferdinand accepted the decision. Naturally, he didn’t agree with it. After QPR’s 2-0 victory over Aston Villa on Monday, Redknapp revealed that Ferdinand had admitted he had ‘never been so nervous during a game’ and was highly animated throughout. Redknapp went on to say that Ferdinand, who admitted in an interview with this newspaper in September that he wanted to become England’s head coach, will go on to become a top-class manager. The defender sits behind his manager Harry Redknapp, who believes Ferdinand will make an excellent coach . Ferdinand is a veteran of social media, and should have been able to ignore the provocation . That is all in the future, but the priority is to win back his place in the QPR team when his three-match suspension is over. He has seven days to lodge an appeal over the punishment, but as it stands he will miss games against Chelsea (Saturday), Manchester City (November 8) and Newcastle (November 22). There were days when Ferdinand, one of the great modern-day defenders, would relish the prospect of facing those three teams in a Manchester United shirt. Instead he will be sitting in the stands. After the career he’s had, this is no way to go out. Having lost his place in the QPR starting line-up, Ferdinand has now been banned for three games .","Former England defender struggling after leaving Manchester United .

"Islamic State militants are changing tactics in the face of U.S.-led air strikes in  Iraq by ditching conspicuous convoys in favour of motorcycles. The jihadists have also taken to erecting their notorious black flag on the rooftops of residential houses and buildings, many of them empty, to create confusion about their actual presence. Tribal sources and eyewitnesses have reported fewer militant checkpoints to weed out 'apostates' and less cell phone use since the air strikes intensified and more U.S. allies pledged to join the campaign that began in August. A tribal sheikh from a village south of Kirkuk said Islamic State elements 'abandoned one of their biggest headquarters in the village' when they heard the air strike campaign was likely to target their area. Scroll down for video . Lone wolf: Islamic State militants are using motorcycles in the hope that by travelling alone they can avoid U.S.-led air strikes more easily and are erecting flags on buildings to create confusion about their actual presence . 'They took all their furniture, vehicles and weapons. Then they planted roadside bombs and destroyed the headquarters,' said the tribal sheikh who declined to be named. 'They don't move in military convoys like before. Instead they use motorcycles, bicycles, and if necessary, they use camouflaged cars,' he said. Civilian casualties are a major concern as U.S. war planes venture deeper into the Tigris River valley and to Iraq's western desert in the name of breaking Islamic State's grip on mostly Sunni parts of Iraq -- nearly one-third of the country. France has also taken part in the air campaign. Tribal and local intelligence sources said an air strike yesterday near Bashir town, 20 km (12 miles) south of Kirkuk, had killed two local senior Islamic State leaders while they were receiving a group of militants from Syria and Mosul. Ongoing fighting makes it impossible to verify the reports. A U.S.-led coalition has started bombing the militants in Syria as well, fearing the Sunni extremist group could threaten national security from a caliphate they have declared in territory seized there and through the border into Iraq. Arab allies have joined in and this week Denmark and Britain both pledged fighter jets to Iraq but not Syria. In another village near Haweeja in northern Iraq, a source said the militants had ditched the use of long convoys of conspicuous vehicles with mounted machine guns and also noted their new preference for motorbikes. Islamic State fighters, who have controlled much of Syria's eastern oil and agricultural provinces for more than a year, swept through mainly Sunni Muslim regions of north Iraq in mid-June, seizing cities including Mosul and Tikrit and halting less than 100 miles (160 km) from the capital Baghdad. Two US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles fly over Iraq after conducting air strikes in Syria earlier this week. Further bombing runs have targeted ISIS oil installations and bases in a bid to cripple the group's revenue stream . Aerial bombardment: The US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles are part of a coalition strike force that aims to roll back and ultimately crush the extremist group that has created a caliphate spanning the Syria-Iraq border . But their recent moves suggest they are worried about the air strikes, which are backed on the ground by a largely hapless Iraqi army but a more formidable Kurdish peshmerga force. 'They were executing people like drinking water... Now the air strikes are very active and have decreased the (militants') ability,' Sheikh Anwar al-Assy al-Obeidi, the head of his tribe in Kirkuk and across Iraq, told Reuters. 'Wherever they hide, people want to get rid of them because they're afraid their houses will be struck,' said Obeidi, who fled to Kurdistan this summer after Islamic State blew up his home. The insurgents have gone underground in their main Syrian stronghold since U.S. President Barack Obama authorised U.S. air strikes on the group in Syria - which began earlier this week. They have disappeared from streets, redeployed weapons and fighters, and cut down their media exposure, residents said. The air strikes have by no means crippled them. Their fighters edged towards a strategic town on northern Syria's border with Turkey on Friday, battling Kurdish forces, while air strikes hit their oilfields and bases in Syria's east. Pit stop: A U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle receives fuel from a KC-135 Stratotanker over northern Iraq after conducting airstrikes in Syria earlier this week . In the eastern Iraqi province of Diyala, an eyewitness said the air strikes had forced the militants to cut back the number of checkpoints which inspected identity cards, looking for those they considered 'apostates': Shi'ites, policemen, soldiers. 'They have also increased the number of headquarters, instead of two, they now have 20, with only 3-4 people in each one of them,' said the eyewitness. An eyewitness in Jalawla town in Diyala also said the militants had decreased their presence on the frontline, no longer confronting army troops with large numbers. In Tikrit, police colonel Hassan al-Jabouri said the militants had withdrawn their checkpoints from main thoroughfares in the city, retreating to side streets. 'They have also switched cars between the areas they control and our intelligence indicates that they have all changed their cell phones. These are always shut and the batteries are removed unless they need to use them,' Jabouri told Reuters. In perhaps the most obvious indication the militants are wary of the strikes, they have taken to digging and hiding in trenches -- just big enough for two people -- in residents' backyards.

U.S. Air Force Major Gena Fedoruk (left) and 1st Lt Marcel Trott take off from in a KC-135 Stratotanker from a base in the U.S. Central Command Area of Responsibility in support of a mission to conduct airstrikes in Syria . Meanwhile, in Syria, fighter jets from the U.S.-led coalition bombed oil installations and other facilities in territory controlled by the Islamic State  in eastern Syria for a second consecutive day, activists said today. The strikes hit two oil areas in Deir el-Zour province a day after the United States and its Arab allies pummeled a dozen makeshift oil producing facilities in the same area near Syria's border with Iraq. The raids aim to cripple one of the terror group's primary sources of cash - black market oil sales that the U.S. says earn up to £2million a day. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes overnight and early Friday hit the Tink oil field as well as the Qouriyeh oil-producing area in Deir el-Zour. Blitzed: A graphic showing some of the most recent US/Arab air strikes carried out in Syria and Iraq . It said air raids also targeted the headquarters of the Islamic State group in the town of Mayadeen. Another activist collective, the Local Co-ordination Committees, also reported four strikes on Mayadeen that it said were conducted by the coalition. The Observatory, which relies on a network of activists inside Syria, said there were reports of casualties in the strikes, but did not have concrete figures. The U.S.-led coalition, which began its aerial campaign against Islamic State fighters in Syria early Tuesday, aims to roll back and ultimately crush the extremist group that has created a caliphate spanning the Syria-Iraq border. Along the way, the militants have massacred captured Syrian and Iraqi troops, terrorized minorities in both countries and beheaded two American journalists and a British aid worker.

"The Hong Kong billionaire playboy who offered nearly £40 million to any man who could turn his homosexual daughter straight, has revealed the luxury lifestyle which any suitor could expect should he win her hand. Cecil Chao sparked global controversy when, refusing to accept his daughter Gigi's civil union to her lesbian partner of eight years, he offered 500 million Hong kong dollars to the man who could convince her to marry him. He now appears to have changed his stance slightly saying that she can choose whatever she wants.

But he still seems to be ignoring Gigi's woos with Sean Yeung, offering a 'moderately deluxe lifestyle' to anyone who successfully pursues his daughter. And the 76-year-old billionaire gave a glimpse of just what he means when by 'moderately deluxe' as he welcomed a reporter from the Financial Times into his Happy Lodge home on the western shore of Hong Kong. The lavish house has a staggering floorspace of some 16,000 square feet spread out over four luxurious floors. The living room has a circular glass wall affording incredible views of the bay outside, a grand piano and a pair of pricey modernist sculptures by Angel Botello. A garish custom-made double chandelier hangs from the ceiling in the centre of the room. European antique furniture adorns the rooms in contrast to Buddhist ornaments and Chinese lacquerware. Mr .

Despite . the offer of his daughter's hand in marriage, Mr Chao, who claimed to . have slept with around 10,000 women, is the one who has been inundated . with marriage offers. He is unlikely to accept any of them however, afraid that any potential wife is only after his money. Gigi is a director of Mr Chao's company Cheuk Nang and also runs a modelling agency. The pair are both qualified helicopter pilots. She . has long been thought of as a natural heir to her father's extensive . business empire, but it is now believed that in the absence of a . husband, he will pass the business on to one of his sons instead. But Mr Chao says it is more the lack of a grandchild that bothers him more than her relationship with Miss Yeung. He told the Financial Times: 'I would not force her to marry a man, but obviously I would from my point of view, prefer her to be married and to have grandchildren.' Mr Chao offered up the dowry for his daughter after he was a apprached by a reporter following rumours that his daughter had entered into a civil partnership with Miss Yeung. The tycoon admitted that he was shocked. Definitely not single: Gigi Chao, right, and her partner Sean Eav, have been together for nine years and married in Paris in 2012 .

She insisted at the time that she will not be ditching her partner – no matter the quality of man her father’s millions can buy. ‘My heart is taken,’ she said.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes a trip to Old Trafford to face a Manchester United side on a roll is perfect for his players despite their shaky confidence. Failure to get out of the Champions League group stages following a 1-1 draw against Basle in midweek was a considerable blow to a squad which had looked to have turned a corner, however small, in recent weeks. Contrast that with United, who are far from at their fluent best but have won five games in a row to lift them into third place in the table. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers saw his team exit the Champions League after a 1-1 draw to Basel . Steven Gerrard had given Liverpool hope with a late free kick but his side were unable to secure the win . A dejected Raheem Sterling (centre) walks off the pitch after Liverpool were only able to draw with Basel . Defeat for Liverpool this weekend would leave them 10 points adrift of their arch-rivals and put Champions League qualification even further out of sight. But Rodgers insists facing up to their greatest rivals could be the ideal remedy. 'The game against Manchester United is perfect for us and we hope to take confidence and spirit into the game,' he said. 'It's more than a football game - you're representing a city and a group of supporters where there has been a great rivalry over many years. 'You've just got to find the ways to refocus the minds of the players, forget and learn from the experiences, and look at it as an opportunity to go and get onto a winning run. 'You have to be [determined] when you're at a club this size. The expectancy is what you want. 'We're very much focused on improving that performance level. We know that we can do that - we can put a run of results together that can keep us climbing. 'But really we want to keep improving on the performance level. As my teams have shown, we'll get better as the season goes on but we want to start that sooner rather than later.' Gerrard (centre) scored two penalties the last time Liverpool played Manchester United at Old Trafford . Gerrard celebrates after scoring the second goal against Manchester United for Liverpool . Unsurprisingly criticism increased after their Champions League failure but Rodgers said they would shrug that off and look to bounce back. 'One thing that we've always had here has been the spirit in the camp,' he added. 'No matter what the outside influences, what is spoken and written about, we've always retained that strong mentality and the focus is very much back on getting ourselves sorted for the weekend. 'It was vital we could not dwell on the disappointment for too long.' Having guided the side to within reach of winning the title last season the tables have turned for Rodgers and the Northern Irishman is now third-favourite to be the next boss to lose his job, behind bottom side Leicester's Nigel Pearson and Alan Irvine, whose West Brom team have won just one in nine league matches. Rodgers built up a considerable amount of credit with owners Fenway Sports Group after last season, which culminated in him being given a new contract, and he is not worried about the Americans wielding the axe just yet. United manager Louis van Gaal has led his team to third position in the table with five consecutive victories . 'One thing I have always had with the owners and the players is solidarity,' he said. 'Of course the owners have seen the progress over the last couple of years and like us all are disappointed with performances this season. 'But it is about reinforcing what we have done well in the last couple of years but planning to keep the club moving forward. 'That is the key objective for them and a primary objective for myself.'","Liverpool crashed out of the Champions League on Tuesday to Basel .

"Another British person has been killed in Syria, according to reports currently being investigated by the Foreign Office. The death of the British national comes just days after two other Britons - Abu Abdullah al Habashi, 21, and Abu Dharda, 20, both from London – died while fighting in the Syrian border town of Kobane. A Foreign Office spokesman today confirmed reports of the death were being investigated and said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Syria. Scroll down for video . The Foreign Office is investigating reports of the death of a British national in the Syrian city of Kobane . The death of the British national comes after Abu Abdullah al Habashi, 21, (left) and Abu Dharda, 20, (right) -both from London - were reportedly killed last week while fighting in the Syrian border town of Kobane . 'The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, where all UK consular services are suspended. 'As we do not have any representation in Syria, it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British nationals there are extremely limited.' It is thought that at least 500 Britons have now joined the conflict in Syria and around 27 are understood to have lost their lives after joining ISIS. The terror threat level in the UK has been raised from substantial to severe in recent months as concerns mount that aspiring British jihadis are travelling to Iraq and Syria to learn terrorist 'tradecraft'. Al Habashi and Dharda were reported to have been killed towards the end of last week while fighting alongside militants in the Syrian city of Kobane. Al-Habashi, from north London, was of Eritrean origin and converted from Christianity to Islam during his teenage years. He is understood to have travelled from the UK to join the Islamic State in Syria in December 2013. Dharda, from west London, came from a British-Somali background and travelled to Syria via Turkey in the same month as al-Habashi. Neither death has been independently verified and their families could not be contacted. Police said they could not comment. Dead: Abu Abdullah al-Habashi (pictured right, next to a militant named Abu Musa as-Somali ) was killed fighting in Kobane. The 20-year-old former Christian of Eritrean origin converted to Islam as a teenager . Militant: Al-Habashi was a well known and popular figure in Islamic State due to his media appearances . Kurdish fighters have been defending Kobane from an ISIS onslaught with the assistance of American air strikes. Al Habashi is believed to have made comments supporting ISIS on social media prior to his death and appeared in at least two propaganda videos put out by the extremist group. In August, he told the BBC that he was at the 'forefront' of fighting and claimed he was one of a few British jihadis who had fought with ISIS – also known as Islamic State - in both Syria and Iraq. His family tried to convince him to return home but he said he was happy in the Middle East and there was 'no going back'. He confidently said in the Newsnight interview: 'They say what all parents would say, ""come back you're crazy etc."" But I'm here for the sake of Allah.' He described his experience as 'the best fighting and the hardest fighting' and that 'US-made weapons was the war booty.' Last month, the British fighter appeared alongside a German and a French ISIS fighter in the IS video, 'Wait. We are also waiting.' Threat: In his video appearance last month, al-Habashi gesticulated wildly as he said: 'We will chop off the heads of the Americans, chop off the heads of the French, chop off the heads of whoever you may bring' In the video, Abu Abdullah described the West as being full of 'puppets and apostates'. He declared: 'We are waiting for you in Dabiq. We are waiting for you in Iraq so bring your coalition of unbelievers because unbelievers will not help you. We will take their weaponry as booty and these people will die.' The British jihadist also vowed that all Islamic State fighters 'are willing to lay down our blood on this soil. So try. Try to come and we will kill every single soldier.' 'We will chop off the heads of the Americans. We will chop off the heads of the French, chop of the heads of whoever you may bring.' He even promised that the black flag of the Islamic State would 'eventually be on the White House.'","British national reportedly dead in Syria just days after two others killed .

"The parents of American aid worker Peter Kassig who has been captured by ISIS have revealed they have been sent a horrifying audio recording of their son begging for his life. Ed and Paula Kassig, from Indianapolis, said it was the first time they have heard the 26-year-old's voice in over a year and he sounded 'like a robot.' The couple, were ordered by ISIS to keep his capture a secret, but when his picture surfaced on TV days ago, they decided to speak out in hopes their son will hear their words. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Plea: Ed and Paula Kassig, from Indianapolis, the parents of American aid worker Peter Kassig who has been captured by ISIS, have revealed have been sent a horrifying audio recording of their son begging for his life . Ed and Paula Kassig, from Indianapolis, said it was the first time they have heard the 26-year-old's voice in over a year and he sounded 'like a robot' In the audio recording Peter said his life was in jeopardy if U.S. airstrikes did not stop . Sitting in their living room with a school photo of Peter - also known by the Islamic name Abdul-Rahman in the background, Mr Kassig told CBS: 'The dynamics have changed now. Steven's [Sotloff] family kept to secrecy, and he was executed. Peter's name has been listed.' In the audio recording Peter said his life was in jeopardy if U.S. airstrikes did not stop. 'It was just automatic, kind of toneless, as though he was a robot,' Mrs Kassig said. Peter with his mother as a child. He is the Kassig's only child. The couple said they hope their son will learn of their TV appearance - either directly or indirectly - and 'know we are doing everything we can to secure his release' Mr Kassig and his son - he described his horrified reaction one morning at breakfast when a photo of his son flashed across the TV . 'And I'm sure it's because they were insisting what he could say.' He described that his time was running out,' Paul told TODAY. 'His vitality, his spark was not in his voice.' Peter's captors threatened him in a chilling video showing the beheading of 47-year-old British aid worker Alan Henning on October 3. The couple told how once the video was made public they moved to a hotel to avoid media attention. Mr Kassig described his reaction one morning at breakfast when a photo of his only child flashed across the TV. 'One minute you look at your scrambled eggs and you look up, it's football. Next minute, look at your scrambled eggs, you look up and there's your son,' he said. 'And you sit there and you have to watch. Everybody's jaw on the place drop. And you gotta fake it, too, 'cause you don't want to stand there and look callous. And inside, you just want to scream. 'Hey, that's my kid.' Just ate it, went back upstairs.' Aid worker: Peter Kassig (left), who has been held captive by ISIS for the past year, first went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier before returning as a medical worker. Right, he is threatened by an ISIS militant . They also speak of the 'demanding' nature of Peter's captors. The Kassigs said ISIS militants have not 'asked' for anything and instead, 'they demand, they simply demand,' Mr Kassig told CBS correspondent Margaret Brennan. Donning a purple jacket and turtleneck top, Mrs Kassig added: 'And their demands have always been ones we cannot accommodate.' Ms Brennan then asked the couple if the demands were 'beyond what is reasonable in terms of money, in terms of power?', to which Mrs Kassig replied: 'In both cases, yes.' Looking down with teary eyes, she continued: 'And we have sent them back messages that we cannot do what you ask. We have tried, but we don't have the power.' In an interview with TODAY they shared portions of a handwritten letter from their son passed on by a former hostage. An inspiration: While in Turkey, Peter (pictured) founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance), an emergency relief group that serves refugee populations and internally displaced persons . Humanitarian work: It was while working on a project for SERA almost exactly a year ago, on October 1, 2013, that Peter (pictured) was captured by members of ISIS as he headed to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria . Mr Kassig read from the letter: 'Don't worry, Dad. If I go down, I won't go down thinking anything but what I know to be true, that you and Mom love me more than the moon.' 'He knows that this is bigger than it just being about him,' Mrs Kassig said. 'And we do too.' They explained their son's conversion to Islam saying: 'He was as taken with the religion as he was with the people. 'It was a natural process for him,' said Mr Kassig. Peter, who has been held captive by ISIS for the past year, first went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier before returning as a medical worker to help victims of war.

Mr and Mrs Kassig's latest plea to Peter's captors comes just a few days after they appealed directly to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi on Twitter, begging him to spare their only son's life. Mrs Kassig posted a letter on the social networking site, reading: 'I am trying to get in touch with the Islamic State about my son's fate. I am an old woman, and Abdul-Rahman is my only child. 'My husband and I are on our own, with no help from the government. We would like to talk to you. How can we reach you?' Beheading: On October 3, Mr Kassig was threatened with death in a video showing the beheading of 47-year-old British aid worker Alan Henning (pictured). He was seen kneeling in the sand at the end of the footage . The tweet followed an emotional YouTube video, released by the couple on October 4, in which they pleaded to Peter's captors to 'show mercy and use their power to let him go'. Mr Kassig, a school teacher, who was filmed on a sofa alongside his wife, told militants: 'Our family deplores all human suffering and the loss of innocent life, no matter who is responsible. 'We know that the Syrians have suffered. We also believe violence is not the solution to the problems that trouble us all.' Speaking directly to her son, Mrs Kassig, who was donning a headscarf and clasping a photo of the aid worker in her hands, added: 'We are so very proud of you and the work you have done to bring humanitarian aid to the Syrian people. President: Barack Obama (pictured) has condemned the death of Mr Henning and urged that U.S. forces and its allies will bring his killers to justice . 'Our hearts ache for you to be granted your freedom so we can hug you again and then set you free to continue the life you have chosen, the life of service to those in greatest need.' The  beheading of Mr Henning  followed the murders of three other captives in similar circumstances: U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines. U.S. officials have confirmed that Mr Kassig is being held by Islamic State militants, but have declined to give any more details of his capture. The aid worker's family said in a statement earlier this month that they had stayed silent about this news 'at the wish of those who have held their son.' President Barack Obama has strongly condemned the death of Mr Henning and urged that U.S. forces and its allies will bring his killers to justice. 'Mr Henning worked to help improve the lives of the Syrian people and his death is a great loss for them, for his family and the people of the United Kingdom,' the politican said in a statement. 'Standing together with our U.K. friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder - as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines - to justice.' The President added that the U.S. and other nations will continue to take action to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the Islamic State group.","Peter Kassig has been threatened with death in a video released by ISIS .

"A fuel with no greenhouse emissions or radioactive waste that is almost unlimited, sounds too good to be true. But scientists have taken one more step to make fusion power useful and affordable. Engineers have designed a concept for a fusion reactor which, when scaled up to the size of a large electrical power plant, would rival costs for a new coal-fired plant with similar electrical output. Engineers have designed a concept for a fusion reactor (pictured) that, when scaled up to the size of a large electrical power plant, would rival costs for a new coal-fired plant with similar electrical output . Until now no-one has come up with a fusion power plant design – dubbed the ‘holy grail’ of energy generation by many - that would produce fuel cheap enough to outperform systems that use fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. Fusion, the process that powers the sun and other stars, entails forging the nuclei of atoms to release energy, as opposed to splitting them, which is fission - the principle behind the atomic bomb and nuclear power. Engineers from the University of Washington have published their design and analysis findings and will present them at the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Fusion Energy Conference in St. Petersburg, Russia, this week. ‘Right now, this design has the greatest potential of producing economical fusion power of any current concept,’ said Thomas Jarboe, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the university. Other designs, such as the experimental fusion reactor project called Iter (its internals are pictured in a diagram) which is currently being built in France have to be much larger than the university's because they rely on superconducting coils that circle around the outside of the device to provide a similar magnetic field . Nuclear fusion is a process by which the nuclei of deuterium and tritium, both isotopes obtained from hydrogen, are fused together to create heavier particles. In theory, energy generated through fusion would leave no dangerous waste or pollute the atmosphere. And the fuel is found in abundance in seawater, which covers more than two-thirds of the planet. The process requires extreme temperatures and pressure equivalent to those found on our Sun and other active stars. While the idea started as a class project, Professor Jarboe and a doctoral student in reactor design, Derek Sutherland, refined the concept. The design builds on existing technology and creates a magnetic field within a closed space to hold plasma in place long enough for fusion to occur - allowing the hot plasma to react and burn. The reactor itself would be largely self-sustaining, meaning it would continuously heat the plasma to maintain thermonuclear conditions. Heat generated from the reactor would heat up a coolant that is used to spin a turbine and generate electricity, similar to how a typical power reactor works. Mr Sutherland said: ‘This is a much more elegant solution because the medium in which you generate fusion is the medium in which you’re also driving all the current required to confine it.’ There are several ways to create a magnetic field, which is crucial for keeping a fusion reactor going. The new design is known as a spheromak, meaning it generates the majority of magnetic fields by driving electrical currents into the plasma itself. This reduces the amount of required materials and allows researchers to shrink the overall size of the reactor. Other designs, such as the experimental fusion reactor project called Iter, which is currently being built in France have to be much larger than the UW’s because they rely on superconducting coils that circle around the outside of the device to provide a similar magnetic field. The researchers estimated the cost of building a fusion reactor power plant using their design compared to building a coal power plant (stock image). Mr Sutherland said: ‘If we do invest in this type of fusion, we could be rewarded because the commercial reactor unit already looks economical. It’s very exciting' When compared with the fusion reactor concept in France, the new design is much less expensive at roughly one tenth of the cost of Iter and would produce five times as much energy. The researchers estimated the cost of building a fusion reactor power plant using their design compared to building a coal power plant. They explained that building a fusion power plant producing 1 gigawatt (1 billion watts) of power would cost $2.7 billion (£1.7 billion), while a coal plant of the same output would cost $2.8 billion (£1.8 billion), according to their analysis. Mr Sutherland said: ‘If we do invest in this type of fusion, we could be rewarded because the commercial reactor unit already looks economical. It’s very exciting.’ The concept that has been created is around one-tenth the size and power output of a final product, which will take years to develop. IT was funded by the US Department of Energy. The researchers have successfully tested the prototype’s ability to sustain a plasma efficiently and as they further develop and expand the size of the device they can ramp up to higher-temperature plasma and get significant fusion power output.","Engineers have designed a concept for a fusion reactor .

"The NHS lost track of 1.8million confidential patient records in a single year, the Daily Mail can reveal. In worrying lapses in data security, sensitive paper records have been dumped in public bins and electronic records found for sale on an internet auction site. The worst cases include details of terminally ill patients being faxed to the wrong number, and patient records being stolen and posted on to the internet. Worrying: The serious data security lapses have included files on a terminally ill patient being faxed to the wrong number . The total is the equivalent of nearly 5,000 records going missing every day. But the real figure is likely to be much higher because in some incidents it was not known exactly how many records were lost. In addition, at present the data protection watchdog relies on hospitals declaring when data has gone missing. Such is the scale of the problem that the watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office, is asking for powers to conduct compulsory audits on hospitals and NHS trusts. The Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, has levied fines totalling nearly £1million on NHS bodies in the last six months. And last night his office warned that more would follow if data protection rules continue to be breached. The figures were compiled from reports of Data Protection Act breaches filed by the Information Commissioner’s Office in the 12 months from July 2011 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Over the year a total of 1,779,597 records were reported lost in 16 major incidents involving NHS bodies. In . May this year, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Foundation . was fined £325,000 after an incident involving more than 69,000 patient . records found on hard disk drives offered for sale on an internet . auction site. The drives . contained an easily readable database with the names, dates of births, . occupations, sexual preferences, sexually transmitted disease test . results and diagnoses for more than 67,000 patients. Costly errors: The Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, has levied fines totalling nearly £1million on NHS bodies in the last six months. (Posed by model) Another database contained the names and dates of birth of more than 1,500 HIV positive patients. It later emerged that 232 hard drives that should have been destroyed had been sold on the auction site. They also contained highly sensitive personal data of tens of thousands more patients and staff including test results, medical conditions and children’s reports. Belfast Health and Social Care Trust was fined £225,000 in June after 100,000 confidential paper records were dumped at a disused hospital site. Trespassers gained access to the site and copies of records – which dated from the 1950s – were posted on the internet. Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust was fined £90,000 in April for faxing 59 patient records containing ‘confidential and sensitive’ data to the wrong number so they ended up with a member of the public. The records belonged to terminally ill patients receiving palliative care and included medical diagnoses, information about patients’ home lives and their resuscitation instructions. In October last year University Hospital, Coventry was warned after 19 patient records were found dumped in a bin. A midwife in Poole was warned after her car was broken into and thieves stole patient diaries which contained sensitive personal data about 240 pregnant women in her care. Hospitals have also been found sending mental health patient records to the wrong patient because he had a similar name. The worst breach involved a CD containing 1.6million patient records, including personal details, belonging to Eastern and Coastal Kent PCT. The CD was lost when a filing cabinet went missing during an office move. The trust was not fined, but signed an undertaking with the ICO not to repeat the error. Other cases around the country have involved unsecured laptops stolen from the home of a staff member. Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘These figures may be shocking, but they will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the NHS’s track record for dealing with patient data. ‘Across the NHS there are some excellent organisations who are addressing this problem well but some of the poor performers are terrifying. ‘There is a real risk that if the NHS doesn’t sort out how it looks after patients’ details people will stop sharing information with their doctor and that could be extremely dangerous for care.’ The Information Commissioner’s Office said: ‘The Health Service holds some of the most sensitive personal information available, so it’s vitally important that patients’ information is being kept secure.’","The total is the equivalent of nearly 5,000 records going missing every day .

It was the first time Lorenz clapped eyes on the Cuban dictator but it certainly wasn't the last. Just one year after the first fateful meeting, Lorenz was living in Havana as his mistress. But her presence there didn't go unnoticed, not least by the CIA, who in 1960 recruited her to kill Castro using poison pills concealed in her face cream. Fateful: Lorenz and Castro pictured at their first meeting aboard the MS Berlin cruise ship in Havana harbour . So how did Lorenz, the daughter of a German American cruise liner captain, go to from lover to would-be killer in such a short space of time? Her story began on the 28th February 1959 when her father's cruise ship, the MS Berlin, on which she also worked, dropped anchor in Havana harbour. As liner dropped anchor, a launch crammed with uniformed men hurtled towards them, among them, fatefully, Castro. 'He was 33, with sparkling eyes,' she remembers, speaking in an interview recorded for History Channel documentary, CIA Declassified. 'And that was it. I was lost in love.' On her return to New York a few days later, she found herself bombarded with calls and invitations to return to Cuba from the dictator. She obliged and, within days, was installed in Castro's penthouse apartment on the 74th floor of the Havana Hilton. After her affair with Castro ended, she went on to have a child with Venezuela's Marcos Pérez Jiménez . Revolutionaries: Fidel Castro of Cuba with Argentine guerrilla leader Che Guevara . Two months later, she discovered - to her delight - that she was pregnant. But her happiness wasn't to last. Drinking a glass of milk one day while heavily pregnant, she suddenly blacked out and came to a few hours later to find herself seriously ill - and without her baby. So ill did she become, she was flown home to New York for treatment. Once there, she was visited by the CIA who revealed that Castro had arranged for her to be given a late term abortion. 'I didn't believe it,' she told the Radio Times. 'But they did a good job of brainwashing me, telling me that he did this to me. It left me heartbroken.' So heartbroken, she was willing to believe agents when they informed her that Castro was not just a threat to America, but intimidatingly dangerous as well. Lorenz remembers: 'They said, ""we want you to take him out"".' She agreed and in January 1960, she travelled to Miami to meet Frank Sturgis; a CIA double-agent who handed her a pot of poison pills. Her role was simple: drop one in Castro's drink and escape unscathed. Frightened she would be discovered by Cuban customs, Lorenz resorted to one more subterfuge and hid the pills inside her pot of cold cream. Resigned: Castro, who stepped down as president in 2008, and Lorenz never saw each other again . As she knew him: Castro pictured at a meeting in Havana in 1959 - the same year he met Lorenz . It was a decision that would prove fateful. Back once more in Castro's Havana penthouse, she attempted to slip the pills into a glass of water but was foiled by the clinging cream. 'I tried to wipe it off, but I couldn't,' she remembers. 'I panicked and tried to flush them down the loo but they wouldn't go down. Then Fidel walked in.' The dictator had got wind of the plot and Lorenz was terrified. 'He took his gun out of its holster,' she says. 'I thought he was going to shoot me, but he gave me the gun and asked, ""Did you come to kill me?"" 'Then he took a puff on his cigar and closed his eyes. He made himself vulnerable because he knew I couldn't do it. He still loved me and I still loved him.' And he was right. Lorenz ejected the bullets and fell into his arms. But her incredible story still wasn't over. Fearing the CIA would kill her if she attempted to remain with Castro, she returned to Miami and never saw her erstwhile lover again. Although she would later have an affair with another dictator, Venezuela's Marcos Pérez Jiménez with whom she had a daughter, and another relationship that resulted in a son, Lorenz' affection for Castro, now 87, remains undiminished. 'The moment I saw the outline of the island from the plane, I knew I couldn't do it,' she says. 'I have a reputation as an assassin but wouldn't kill a bug.'

"The fault zone expected to generate the next 'big one' earthquake has gone silent. Researchers are baffled by the lack of activity at the 1,00km long Cascadia fault which stretches from Northern Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino in California. Experts believe the lack of activity could point to a build up of pressure - which could lead to a massive killer quake. Scroll down for video . The Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) 'megathrust' fault is a 1,000 Km long dipping fault that stretches from Northern Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino California.It separates the Juan de Fuca and North America plates. The Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) 'megathrust' fault is a 1,000 Km long dipping fault that stretches from Northern Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino California. It separates the Juan de Fuca and North America plates. New Juan de Fuca plate is created offshore along the Juan de Fuca ridge. The Juan de Fuca plate moves toward, and eventually is shoved beneath, the continent (North American plate). Two independent research initiatives have both found the same thing - the sound of silence under the sea. The Cascadia earthquake fault zone lies underwater between 40 and 80 miles offshore of the Pacific Northwest coastline. Earthquake scientists have listening posts along the coast from Vancouver Island to Northern California, and have been using ships to drop off and later retrieve ocean bottom seismographs. These record for up to a year right on top of the fault zone. However, they have detected few signs of the grinding and slipping they expected. It is 'a puzzle,' according to University of Oregon geophysics professor Doug Toomey. 'What is extraordinary is that all of Cascadia is quiet. It's extraordinarily quiet when you compare it to other subduction zones globally,' Toomey told the Seattle pi. Two teams have been examining the area. A joint Japanese-Canadian team dropped instruments offshore of Vancouver Island, while Toomey's team is in its fourth year of deployments. Named the Cascadia Initiative, it is rotating among subduction zone segments offshore of Washington, Oregon and Northern California. More videos available at Berkeley Seismo Lab . Researchers have been using ships to drop off and later retrieve ocean bottom seismographs - but still say the fault remains 'eerily quiet'. The Cascadia Initiative (CI) is an onshore/offshore seismic and geodetic experiment that takes advantage of an Amphibious Array to study questions ranging from megathrust earthquakes to volcanic arc structure to the formation, deformation and hydration of the Juan De Fuca and Gorda plates. Researchers say the area is 'locked'. The Japanese-Canadian team, which published their research in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, wrote: 'The lack of interplate seismicity is interpreted to reflect complete healing and locking of the megathrust over three centuries after the previous great earthquake,' wrote Koichiro Obana and his co-authors in the BSSA paper. Experts say this could cause major problem. 'If there were low levels of offshore seismicity, then we could say some strain is being released by the smaller events,' Toomey said. 'If it is completely locked, it means it is increasingly storing energy and that has to be released at some point.' The Cascadia Initiative (CI) is an onshore/offshore seismic and geodetic experiment that takes advantage of an Amphibious Array to study questions ranging from megathrust earthquakes to volcanic arc structure to the formation, deformation and hydration of the Juan De Fuca and Gorda plates. Toomey described himself as 'very concerned' and said it is 'imperative' people in the Northwest continue to prepare for a big earthquake. The last full rip of the Cascadia Subduction Zone happened in January 1700. The exact date and destructive power was determined from buried forests along the Pacific Northwest coast and an 'orphan tsunami' that washed ashore in Japan. Geologists digging in coastal marshes and offshore canyon bottoms have also found evidence of earlier great earthquakes and tsunamis. The inferred timeline of those events gives a recurrence interval between Cascadia megaquakes of roughly every 400 to 600 years, reports the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network.","Cascadia 'megathrust' fault is a 1,000 Km long dipping fault .

"The daughter of a woman involved in a Satanic sex cult has revealed her evil mother made her sleep with 1,800 men by the time she was 18. The woman, who has called herself Annabelle Forest, was initiated into the sick cult after having to watch her mother perform a sex act on the cult's ringleader Colin Batley at the age of seven. At 11 she was raped twice by the man, and three years later made to take part in group sex with her mother at their home near Llanelli in Wales, where at least two other households on the street took part in cult activity. Jacqueline Marling (left) and Colin Batley (right) systemically sexually abused the girl throughout her childhood. The sick neighbours were jailed in 2011 for their roles in a satanic sex cult in Wales . Colin Batley and Jacqueline Marling were jailed for systemically sexually abusing the girl as she was growing up. Batley's wife Elaine was also convicted of sexually assaulting a child alongside Sheila Millar, a prostitute who is thought to have frequented Batley's house. A 2011 trial at Swansea Crown Court heard how Batley, who was married at the time and lived on the same street in a different house, wore hooded robes and chanted before having group sex with the women and children. Snakes would be kept near an 'altar' in his lounge where residents on the quiet cul-de-sac would congregate on Sunday evenings. Now settled with her own family, Annabelle has spoken out against Batley and her mother who were sentenced to at least 11 years and 12 years imprisonment respectively. 'Nothing can hurt me as much as my mum and that man. My mother was an evil woman and I'll never forgive her,' she said. 'To be abused like that by your own mum beggars belief.' In her recently released memoir, Annabelle reveals she had slept with almost 2,000 men by her 18th birthday after being forced in to prostitution to raise money for the cult's 'church'. The couple's twisted ideology was based on the Book of the Law by Aleister Crowley, and made children  believe they were proving themselves to god by having sex with other members, all the while egged on by Batley, now 48. House of horrors: The girl was forced to endure years of sexual abuse at the house in Wales where Batley taught her and other children  that passing sexual 'tests' would please God . Batley and his bisexual wife Elaine invited neighbours from the cul-de-sac round to their home where Annabelle and other children were suffered horrendous sexual abuse . 'I was 11 when he first raped me - the worst thing about it was the fact that he made me think I was doing it out of choice,' she said. Colin Batley was jailed in 2011 after sexually abusing children for decades . 'It was awful. The most painful and shocking thing that had ever happened - but it was my path, that's what he told me, and if I didn't do it I would go to the Abyss, which was our version of hell. 'Colin knew how to manipulate you, to make you believe anything he said.' 'We weren't even allowed to look in his eyes. 'He ruled our little community with an iron will and we were made to do what he ordered for fear of angering the Gods.' After being sexually assaulted by her own mother aged 14, the teenager tried to kill herself. 'Afterwards, Colin asked me if I enjoyed it and I knew what I had to say - I had to say yes. 'But inside I felt like dying. 'I was a schoolgirl by day and a sex slave at night. 'It got so bad that at one point I tried to take my own life.' At the age of 17, Ms Forest became pregnant by her cruel step-father. A year after the birth of the child she fled the house in the dead of the night, and did not see either her mother or Batley until their sentencing in 2011. 'I went to the sentencing in court because I wanted to see her one last time, I wanted her to reach out to me, to say it was all his fault and she was under his spell. Jacqueline Marling (left) and Batley's bisexual wife Elaine (right) were both found guilty of sexual offences. Batley's wife is seen sporting an Egyptian tattoo - a common characteristics of cult members who had strong beliefs in the Egyptian god Horus . Evil: Colin Batley forced the woman into prostitution to raise money for the cult's 'church' and fathered a baby with her when she was just 17 . The woman, who now calls herself Annabelle Forest, has detailed her horrifying childhood in a book . 'But she didn't. She just made a face and asked what I was doing there. 'She went to prison unrepentant and I suppose that made me realise it wasn't just him. She was evil too. 'As a mother myself I can hardly believe how she treated me. It was unnatural and cruel. 'But there is no point getting depressed about it, you have to live for the future. 'But I never want to see her again. Nothing can hurt me as much as they did, but that is what makes me stronger.' Annabelle, who now lives in north England, has chronicled her horrifying childhood in a memoir tited The Devil on The Doorstep: My Escape from a Satanic Sex Cult. The mother-of-two hopes it will help save other children from the ordeal she faced. 'If there's one thing I would like to achieve with my book, it would be for others to start really paying attention to the community they live in.' 'There are abused children everywhere - it just takes one person to see it and that life could be saved.' The cult’s inspiration, Aleister ‘the Great Beast’ Crowley, believed himself to be a prophet of a new age of personal liberty, controlled by the ancient Egyptian god Horus. He was a bisexual heroin addict whose doctrine for life was ‘Do What Thou Wilt’, advocating sexual promiscuity and prostitution. Crowley was a frequenter of orgies and brothels, and contracted gonorrhea from a prostitute. Born into a wealthy family in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, he gained such notoriety during his lifetime that he was denounced in the press as ‘the wickedest man in the world’. Crowley’s work has been cited as an influence by famous figures including Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, who bought Crowley’s former home and set up an occult bookshop and publishing house which published some of his work. One of Crowley’s publications, the Book of the Law, referred to by the prosecution in Batley and Marling's trial, includes the passage: ‘Let all chaste women be utterly despised among you.' And, in the Authorised Popular Commentary to the The Book of Law, he wrote this: ‘Some of the most passionate and permanent attachments have begun with rape. Rome was founded thereon.’ Aleister Crowley is one of the most notorious satanists of the 20th century and has been described by the press as the 'wickedest man in the world'","'Annabelle Forest' was exposed to the sick cult at the age of seven .

"Chelsea striker Diego Costa was fortunate not to be sent off for stamping on Liverpool's Emre Can, according to former Premier League referee and Sportsmail columnist Graham Poll. The ex-Atletico Madrid man was attempting to grab the ball for a throw-in during his side's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg when he came down hard on the lower part of Can's right leg. The 21-year-old German was left writhing on the turf in pain but referee Michael Oliver allowed play to go on as normal after the incident, with Costa avoiding a card. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers: Diego Costa doesn't need to stamp he's top class . Chelsea striker Diego Costa (right) moves towards the ball after Emre Can takes a tumble off the pitch . Costa appears to stamp on Can's right leg during a feisty opening period at Stamford Bridge . Can was left writhing on the ground in pain but Costa was not punished my referee Michael Oliver . But Poll believes the forward was lucky not to be sent for an early bath with the tie evenly poised at 0-0 on the night and 1-1 on aggregate. Poll said: 'Diego Costa should have been dismissed early on against Liverpool for a blatant stamp on Emre Can and that would have cost Chelsea dear. 'They would have missed him for the rest of this game and then the massive Premier league clash against Manchester City this Saturday. 'The question now is will the Football Association act retrospectively and charge Costa with violent conduct? To do so they have to check that referee Michael Oliver did not see the incident; it might seem obvious that he didn't as he took no disciplinary action but once Oliver confirms that neither he nor his colleagues saw the stamp they should charge Costa. Costa and Can clash after the incident, which occurred close to Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho . German midfielder Can has to be held back from Costa by his Liverpool team-mate Martin Skrtel . Thierry Henry (left) and Jamie Redknapp both agreed that Costa should've been shown a red card . COSTA'S STAMP . Costa is confronted by Emre Can in the 12th minute after stamping on the Liverpool star's ankle. POLL'S VERDICT: Costa should have been dismissed for the stamp. The question is will the FA charge Costa with violent conduct? To do so they have to check ref Michael Oliver didn't see it. PENALTY KICK? Martin Skrtel appears to bring down Costa in the area in the 23rd minute but Oliver gives a goal-kick. Sky pundit Thierry Henry said at half-time: 'Skrtel doesn't need to commit, the referee had a clear view and didn't give a penalty.' POLL'S VERDICT: Jose Mourinho can have a Justifiable moan about the 'campaign' against Chelsea after Costa is clearly fouled by Skrtel. Oliver has a clear view but awards a goal-kick when it should have been a penalty. HALF-TIME RAGE . Outraged by Oliver's decision not to award Costa a penalty, Mourinho confronted the referee in the tunnel at half-time and had to be shepherded away by fourth official Phil Dowd. POLL'S VERDICT: If they did their jobs, the officials would report Mourinho. Managers are not allowed to do this. SECOND STAMP . Costa and Skrtel tangle again in the 54th minute. This time the Chelsea striker stamps on the defender's foot when the pair chase a loose ball and Skrtel retaliates by swinging his foot at Costa. POLL'S VERDICT: I'd give Costa the benefit of the doubt as he was airborne and had to land somewhere. But both players should have been cautioned as they went head to head. HEAD TO HEAD . Costa tussles with Steven Gerrard in the 12th minute of extra-time and puts his hand over the Liverpool captain's face. The pair go head to head and are both booked. POLL'S VERDICT: Having decided not to caution Costa and Skrtel, he gave yellow cards to Costa and Gerrard when they repeated the head-to-head act. 'That should be done by 6pm on Wednesday meaning that a ban could be imposed in time to take effect for Saturday. Whether Chelsea would appeal would depend on whether that could cause enough delay to make Costa available for Saturday's key fixture. 'There can be no blame attached to Oliver for missing the Costa incident as replays showed his view, from a good position, was blocked by Jordan Henderson. In fact Oliver's positioning was good throughout the first half when he correctly waved Chelsea's very early penalty appeals away when the ball struck Lucas Leiva on the arm.' Jose Mourinho's men welcome champions City to Stamford Bridge this Saturday, with the game likely to have a huge impact on the title race. Chelsea currently sit top of the Premier League, five points clear of Manuel Pellegrini's side. Sky Sports pundits Jamie Redknapp and Thierry Henry both agreed with Poll at half-time, insisting that £32million man Costa should have seen red. Sportsmail columnist Redknapp said: 'It's a blatant red card, bang out of order and takes a liberty. He stamps and it's a certain red card, but the ref can't see it. The implications would have been huge because he would have missed the game on Saturday [against Manchester City]. Henry added: 'It is a red card. He knows what he is doing . We all love his passion but he didn't have to go all the way and step on the guy.' Poll had more sympathy for Costa later in the first half when he went down inside Liverpool's box after a clumsy challenge from Martin Skrtel. Oliver, who booked Costa for diving against Burnley earlier this season, waved away the Spain international's appeals for a penalty but did not show him a yellow card. Poll said: 'I struggle to understand Olivers' decision to award Liverpool a goal-kick in the 22nd minute after Martin Skrtel tripped Costa. 'Oliver had gone wide to get a good view and by awarding a goal-kick he indicated that Skrtel had not played the ball. So, for Oliver surely either Costa dived or it was a penalty. 'Oliver, of course cautioned Costa in the opening game of the season when he wrongly thought he had dived at Burnley. This time he didn't go that far but should have given Chelsea the penalty they deserved for Skrtel's unnecessary challenge which caught Costa.' Former Arsenal striker Henry was in agreement, despite some reservations when seeing the incident live. Costa attempts to move past Skrtel and towards Liverpool's goal during a Chelsea attack . Skrtel appears to make contact with Costa's right leg as the ball gets away from the in-form forward . Chelsea striker Costa is sent tumbling to the ground but was not awarded a penalty or booked for diving . 'I thought it wasn't a penalty at first but the more I see it the more I think that it is,' he said. 'I don't know why Skrtel needs to commit.' Poll added: 'Jose Mourinho looked furious and no doubt feels this added to his feeling that match officials are against him and Chelsea. 'If they did their jobs they would report him for his approach to the them in the tunnel before the start of the second half. 'Managers are not permitted to do this as Mourinho knows, as does fourth official Phil Dowd who was seen alerting Mourinho that his actions were on camera.' Chelsea boss Mourinho reacts angrily after Costa is denied a penalty during the first half . The Portuguese believes there has been a campaign against his side when it comes to penalties this season . Mourinho talks to referee Michael Oliver in the tunnel at half-time after being angered by his decisions . Costa was at the centre of more controversy in the second half when he again caught a Liverpool player with his studs. The Chelsea man was running towards goal when his left boot caught that of Skrtel, an incident which resulted in the pair going face-to-face with each other in an angry exchange. Poll said: 'Costa was involved in another clash and potential stamp early in the second half as he trod on Skrtel after the Liverpool defender had tackled him fairly. 'I'd give Costa the benefit of the doubt on this one as he was airbourne and had to land somewhere. Referees cannot guess, nor look at a player's reputation, hence the benefit of doubt going Costa's way. 'Both players should though have been cautioned as they went head-to-head after the incident. We used to call that 'adopting an aggressive attitude' and would always book both players. Now that's clearly not the case.' Costa lands on Skrtel's left foot as he runs after the ball during the second period at Stamford Bridge . The Chelsea man makes contact with his studs but Graham Poll believes he deserves the benefit of the doubt . Costa was involved in one final scuffle when he clashed with Steven Gerrard in the 12th minute of extra-time. The striker put his hand around Gerrard's face as they wrestled each other to the floor. After standing up, they went head-to-head before dragged apart by concerned team-mates.

"Two Austrian sisters believed to have joined ISIS after disappearing from their home last week are staying with their grandmother on the Syrian border, it has been claimed. Violetta, 17, and Viktoria, 16, vanished from  Vienna last Saturday taking only their phones and passports, leading mother Setaniye to conclude they had gone to join the Islamic State. However, Setaniye, 46, now says the girls have called her from their grandmother's house in Turkey, close to the Syrian border, but would not discuss whether they would enter the country. Sisters Violetta, 17 (left), and Viktoria, 16, were thought to be in Syria having joined ISIS, but their mother now says the girls have called her from Turkey where they are staying with their grandmother . She told The Local: 'At least I have proof that they are alive. I had started to imagine that maybe they were not even alive, but now I know they are alive, although I still don't have them back with me.' Authorities investigating the girls' disappearance have downplayed the possibility that they could be fighting with the terror group, and insist there is no evidence the new phonecall came from Turkey. If the pair do join Islamic State militants then they will follow  Samra Kesinovic, 17, and friend Sabina Selimovic, 15, who were dubbed the 'poster girls for jihad' after going to Syria in April. The pair disappeared suddenly, leaving notes for their parents which read: 'Don’t look for us. We will serve Allah – and we will die for him'. Since then their social media accounts have been used to pump out pro-Islamic State propaganda aimed at encouraging others to join them. The pair are thought to have been married to Chechen rebels as soon as they arrived in Syria, and are both now believed to be pregnant. Speaking about Violetta and Viktoria, Setaniye said previously that her husband had died from cancer and her daughters turned to religion in order to cope. She added: 'The two seemed to have been taking some comfort from religion but I was worried lately that they appeared to be getting a bit extreme. According to mother Setaniye the girls won't say whether they plan to go to Syria. Earlier this year Sabina Selimovic, 15 (pictured), and Samra Kesinovic, 17, also fled Vienna to fight for the Islamic State . Sabina (left) and Samra (right) became known as the poster girls for jihad after their social media accounts were used to spread ISIS propaganda after they fled to join the Islamists . 'They were acting a bit strange but as a single mum I was always so busy perhaps I didn't pay as much attention as I should. 'I last saw them at the weekend when they said they were going to the shops and they never came back. They should only have been gone a few minutes but when an hour had gone past I worried, and when I looked there was no sign of them.' She said that her initial concerns turned into panic when she checked the girls' rooms and found the both of them had taken their passports. The 46-year-old mother added: 'Going back over their behaviour now over the last few weeks I'm convinced and terrified that they may have travelled to Syria to join ISIS.' Security sources reported earlier this month that fellow teenagers Samra and Sabinas had been in contact, saying they regretted their decision and wanted to return home. This claim reportedly infuriated ISIS leaders who are waging a constant propaganda war in order to lure young, impressionable people to their cause. According to anti-terrorism police in the girls' homeland, it is almost certain that they would have been ordered to retract anything they had said to keep the flow of recruits coming. Sabina (left) and Samra (right), began posting images of their new lives abroad in an attempt to get other girls to join them, and now authorities fear Viktoria and Violetta may have done exactly that . An Austrian security insider said: 'If they really want it to be believable that the girls are now claiming they don't want to come home, they should let them give the interview on neutral territory where it's possible to see that they aren't being threatened by a gun. 'If the claim they want to come home is untrue, they have the opportunity to walk back into Syria.' Meanwhile Setaniye has filed a complaint with Austrian police to say that her daughters are missing, but police and the Austrian Interior Ministry have so-far declined to comment . However, an insider said the disappearance was a cause for concern, and was being investigated.","Sisters Viktoria, 16, and Violetta, 17, disappeared from Vienna last week .

"A pro-democracy demonstrator has threatened to throw himself from a bridge in the latest dramatic protest scenes to hit Hong Kong. Police armed with pepper spray and batons clashed with demonstrators in the Mog Kok district, in Kowloon, overnight. Tens of thousands of people, many of them students, have poured into the city's streets in the past week to peacefully protest China's restrictions on the election for the city's top leader. But the area has been witness to violent clashes between pro-democracy student protesters and their antagonists over the weekend. The demonstrator shouted and waved to crowds below, threatening to throw himself off the bridge as he protested against the blocking of the roads near the Government Complex.

Protesters are calling for open elections and the resignation of Hong Kong's Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who last night agreed to hold talks with the protest leaders in a bid to diffuse the growing unrest . As the standoff between the protesters and the government entered its eighth day, tempers flared and patience was waning among residents who oppose the occupation of the streets and the disruption it brings. Police said they had to disperse the crowds with force early this morning because they provoked officers with verbal abuse, while the students accuse police of failing to protect them from attacks by mobs intent on driving them away. The students claim that police had allied with criminal gangs - including triads -  to clear them, but the government has vehemently denied it. The city's top leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, appeared on television last night to once again urge everyone to go home, saying key roads paralyzed by protesters need to return to normal by Monday.

'The government and the police have the duty and determination to take all necessary actions to restore social order so the government and the 7 million people of Hong Kong can return to their normal work and life,' Leung said. On Sunday, the atmosphere on the streets was tense amid fears police may use pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the protesters, as they did last weekend. The University of Hong Kong, among others, warned students to leave the streets. 'I am making this appeal from my heart because I genuinely believe that if you stay, there is a risk to your safety,' said Peter Mathieson, the university's president. 'Please leave now: You owe it to your loved ones to put your safety above all other considerations.'

Pro-democracy protesters take a rest on the occupied road during the ongoing protests of mass civil disobedience campaign Occupy Hong Kong . Student leaders called off planned talks with the government until officials respond to claims that police tolerated attacks by alleged mobsters . The protests are the strongest challenge to authorities in Hong Kong - and in Beijing - since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing has promised that the city can have universal suffrage by 2017, but it says a committee of mostly pro-Beijing figures must screen candidates for the top job. The protesters are also demanding Leung's resignation, but he has refused. The next steps are uncertain, after student leaders called off planned talks with the government until officials respond to claims that police tolerated attacks by alleged mobsters. Police had earlier arrested 19 people in the brawls in Mong Kok, including eight men believed to have backgrounds linked to triads, or organized crime. 'In the last week we have seen the police have cooperated with gangs and triads. They are no longer law enforcers. I don't think they deserve our respect anymore,' said accountant Tony Chan, 26. Pro-democracy protesters rest against a roadside barrier on a street outside the Hong Kong Government Complex. Thousands of pro-democracy supporters continue to occupy the streets . On Sunday, the atmosphere on the streets was tense amid fears police may use pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the protesters, as they did last weekend. The University of Hong Kong, among others, warned students to leave the streets . The government said today it was happy to talk to the students, and that it hoped protest leaders would cooperate and allow the reopening of the roads outside the government's headquarters. Thin streams of protesters were gathering Sunday in Admiralty, a key ground for the movement, following a massive rally lasting hours Saturday. The arrival of three police vans at the protest ground outside Leung's office sparked tensions, as protesters worried the vans carried arms that could be used against them. Police negotiators tried to persuade protesters to let the vans through and said they carried only food and water for officers. 'I believe there will be lots of people who want to stop the police clearing this place. But if the police use rubber bullets, or real bullets, there will be many people who will leave the place because it will be too dangerous,' said Jack Fung, 19, a student. Fung said he supported allowing civil servants to go back to work Monday, but he believed protesters should block Leung from entering his office. In Mong Kok, the violence calmed later Sunday but rowdy crowds kept up loud and heated street arguments. Many residents and business people are fed up with the disruption, saying they want to return to normal life as soon as possible. Police officers carrying guns patrolled the area, and at least one officer was seen carrying tear gas canisters. Johnson Cheung, 26, was among about 60 of the movement's opponents. He said he supported the freedom of expression, but complained that the protesters are driving away tourists and income for businesses. 'This is a public place, people need to use this road, people need to live here,' said Cheung, who works in a duty free shop. 'The students don't need to make a living, their parents pay for them. But we have jobs, we have to live.' In Admiralty, an unidentified man who opposed the protests drew media attention when he stood on a footbridge as if to jump. Firefighters opened an air cushion beneath him as he demanded the students leave. 'You've been out here a whole week. I have three kids who need to go to school and I need to go to work,' he shouted at the crowd.","Man threatened to throw himself from bridge as he protested against the blocking of roads near Government Complex .

"During the Triassic period, the rauisuchid predator ruled the land while the phytosaur was the master of the sea - and experts have long believed the two large reptiles lived separate lives. But, a tooth found embedded in the leg bone of the land-dwelling rauisuchid may cast doubts on this theory. The 220-million-year old tooth is said to have belonged to the semi-aquatic phytosaur and was left in the thigh bone following a savage battle between the two creatures. To study the tooth, without destroying the bone, researchers used computed tomography (CAT) scans to build a 3D model of it (pictured in blue). A selection of other, fossilised phytosaur teeth are pictured. The tooth was found in the bone of a rauisuchid, a large land reptile. Until now, experts did not think the creatures interacted . And multiple wounds suggest the two  beasts may have clashed regularly, despite their different habitats. Rauisuchids typically had large heads, sharp teeth, long hind legs, and scales on their backs. They measured up to 25ft (7.6 metres) tall, with 2ft (0.6 metres) long heads. By comparison, the phytosaur, which means ‘plant lizard’, typically grew to 6ft (2 metres) long. Professor Stephanie Drumheller, of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, said: ‘To find a phytosaur tooth in the bone of a rauisuchid is very surprising. ‘These rauisuchids were the largest predators in their environments. ‘You might expect them to be the top predators as well, but here we have evidence of phytosaurs, who were smaller, semi-aquatic animals, potentially targeting and eating these big carnivores.’ A model skeleton of a phytosaur is pictured in the Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona. Experts believe the semi-acquatic creatures had 166 teeth and were predators of the Middle and Upper Triassic . Rauisuchids typically had large heads, sharp teeth, long hind legs, and scales on their backs. They measured up to to 25ft (7.6 metres) long, with 2ft (0.6 metres) long heads. They were considered one of the most dangerous predators of the Middle and Upper Triassic. Rauisuchids were reptiles, but they resembled dinosaurs so closely that they are often mistaken for dinosaur ancestors. By comparison, phytosaurs resembled modern-day crocodiles. They had short legs, wide, heavy bodies with rows of armoured scales, long tails, and long toothy snouts. These teeth were sharp and cone-shaped. The name phytosaur means ‘plant lizard’, and they typically grew to 39ft (12 metres) long. They were considered one of largest water predators of the Triassic Period. Although the bone was dug up in the western United States, at the time the Triassic reptiles would have been roaming the super continent Pangea, which was just beginning to break up into the individual land masses we see today. It challenges beliefs about the lifestyles of these ancient creatures, who were distant relatives of modern-day crocodiles that would have towered over the early dog-sized dinosaurs. Some lived on land, while others lived in water - and it was believed, until now, that they didn’t interact. The analysis of the bite marks in two thigh bones suggests both predator species at the top of their respective food chains not only crossed paths, but the smaller creature may have potentially eaten the larger. Rauisuchids typically had large heads, sharp teeth, long hind legs, and scales on their backs.They measured up to 25ft (7.6 metres) tall, with 2ft (0.6 metres) long heads. The polonosuchus - a genus of rauisuchian - is pictured . The bones are stored at the University of California Museum of Paleontology, Berkeley. To study the tooth, without destroying the bone, the researchers used computed tomography (CAT) scans to build a 3D model. This, along with an examination of the bite marks, revealed a story of multiple struggles. The team found tissue surrounding the bite marks revealed the rauisuchid was attacked twice and survived. But, evidence of crushing, impact and flesh-stripping, without healing, showed the animal later died in another attack. By comparison, the crocodile-like phytosaur, which means ‘plant lizard’, typically grew to 6ft (2 metres) long. This image is an illustration of the belodon - a genus of the phytosaur . Professor Drumheller said: ‘Finding teeth embedded directly in fossil bone is very, very rare. ‘This is the first time it has been identified among phytosaurs, and it gives us a smoking gun for interpreting this set of bite marks.’ The findings also suggest previous distinctions between water and land-based food chains from this time, the Late Triassic Period, might be built upon mistaken assumptions made from fossil remains. Palaeontologist Dr Michelle Stocker, of Cirginia Tech, added: ‘This research will call for us to go back and look at some of the assumptions we have had in regard to the Late Triassic ecosystems. ‘The aquatic and terrestrial distinctions made were oversimplified, and I think we have made a case the two spheres were intimately connected.’ The research also calls into question the importance of size in a fight. Added Professor Drumheller: ‘Both of the femora we examined came from some of the physically largest carnivorous species present at both locations. ‘Yet they were targeted by other members of the region, specifically phytosaurs. Thus, size cannot be the only factor in determining who is at the top of the food chain.’","The tooth was embedded in the leg of a land-based rauisuchid .

"A controversial new social experiment is endeavoring to interview white people all over the United States in an effort to document 'their understanding of their own whiteness' - and is causing an online furor while doing so. Some 24 people have already been interviewed for The Whiteness Project - all from Buffalo, New York - with a goal of getting 1,000 from all parts of the country, with the resultant videos to air in packages on PBS. In the first video installment to be released, a woman compares the discrimination she receives for having multiple tattoos to the judgement a black person might receive. 'I get discriminated against just as much as a minority does,' she said. Scroll down for video . Causing a stir: The Whiteness Project, a social experiment organized by documentary filmmaker Whitney Dow, is seeking to interview 1,000 across America asking them to explain their 'whiteness' Opinions: The first wave of the campaign, featuring 24 interviews with people from Buffalo, New York, has been attacked for 'mostly just criticizing minority groups' Hardships: The multi-platform investigation into 'how Americans who identify as ''white'' experience their ethnicity' 'I’m not a normal-looking white woman. 'I’m a tattoo-ed woman ... so you can’t put me in the same boat (as black people).' One elderly gentleman, Harold, says that he believes white people are now more often discriminated against than black people. Another woman, who described herself as voluptuous, said she doesn't like the reaction she gets from black men when she's dressed provocatively. 'When you smile and say hello (to a black man), that is not an invitation to follow me and come to my door,' the woman says in her video. The campaign has been furiously attacked on social media. Critics like  Miles Klee from The Daily Dot claimed most of the white people spent their interview time 'criticizing minorities',Gothamist reported. Klee said the videos could 'easily be mistaken for satire where it not for the involvement of PBS'. The Whiteness Project is being helmed by documentary filmmaker Whitney Dow. Online anger: Many took to Twitter to vent over the project when it debuted . Is it a joke? Some people believed the video interviews were satirical and not actually serious . Controversial: Some of the people interviewed had strange opinions on minority groups . Dow admitted on Twitter to having nerves about debuting the project and he was worried about people's reactions. 'A bit nervous as I know it has a huge chance of being misunderstood,' Dow posted online. 'White people have been very tentative about engaging.' 'POC either get it right away or are hugely offended.' Dow has since shut down the Twitter page for the Whiteness Project, which had only about 40 followers. He said in his artistic statement that the point of the experiment was to investigate something that hasn't been explored before. In charge: The Whiteness Project is the brainchild of documentary filmmaker Whitney Dow . 'Most people take for granted that there is a “white” race in America, but rarely is the concept of whiteness itself investigated. 'What does it mean to be a “white”? Can it be genetically defined? Is it a cultural construct? A state of mind? 'How does one come to be deemed “white” in America and what privileges does being perceived as white bestow?' It is unclear whether the Whiteness Projects interviews will continue in the wake of the controversy.","New campaign by documentary filmmaker Whitney Dow and PBS .

"A  woman has been tied to a stake, shot full of arrows and burned alive in Paraguay after being accused of witchcraft. Indigenous woman Adolfina Ocampos, 45, was killed by members of the Mbya Guarani ethnic group after the community's chief sentenced her to death. While the date of the killing was unclear, it occurred in the village of Tahehyi, 180 miles north of the captial Asuncion. The woman was killed when tribesmen in the country's remote north (pictured) accused her of  witchcraft . Nine men from the village of Tahehyi, located north of the capital Asuncion have been charged with murder . Fany Aguilera, a local prosecutor, charged nine men in the village with first-degree murder and they have admitted to killing the woman. The UN Refugee Agency estimates that thousands of people worldwide are accused of being witches every year. They are often abused, cast out of their families and communities and sometimes killed. However Jose Zanardini, an Italian anthropologist and Catholic priest, said the recent case in Paraguay was unusual. He said: 'I've been working in Paraguay for 40 years and I can't remember a similar episode of an execution for alleged sorcery. 'The tragic death of this woman is isolated and out of the ordinary within the co-existence of Paraguay's 20 ethnic indigenous groups. In general, the Indians are very peaceful and tolerant.' The state agency for the protection of indigenous peoples said Wednesday that 'although the indigenous communities are ruled by customary law, their acts cannot violate the constitutional rights of respecting the life and the liberty of people'.","Adolfina Ocampos, 45, was sentenced to death by village's community chief .

"President Obama and his family are expected to leave Washington later this week for a 17-day vacation in Hawaii. This will be the First Family's sixth Christmas in Hawaii since he was elected president, and in keeping with tradition they are expected to spend it on the island of Kailua. The White House announced on Friday that the Obamas will depart next week after what is expected to be a light work schedule for the president in Washington. The First Family's are expected to spent their sixth Christmas in a row in Hawaii and will fly there later this week at an estimated cost of $100,000 to taxpayers . The president and his family traditionally spend their Christmas break in a rented private beach front residence with spectacular ocean views. The Obama's covers the cost of the accommodation that typically costs up to $3,500 a day, or $75,000 a month, but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill which costs in the region of $1 million. For his first three years in office, the Obamas rented a $24,500-per-week gated Plantation Estate, which offered security and privacy on the white sand beach of Kailua Bay. Since then the Obamas have rented a few different houses on Kailuana Place, which has provoked different opinions from those who live in the area. The Obama's will cover the cost of their accommodation, but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill . 'It's exciting. It's really an honor to have him here, and when he's around – actually the place is super safe because we have all this security around,’ Lanette Hayashi, who lives locally, told Hawaii News Now. 'We go through two security points and so the second one, we have to get out of our car.  We have to be searched ourselves, plus our car has to be completely searched,' said a woman called Madeline, who has lived on the street for more than four decades. When the President visits, the canal running through the Kailuana Street neighborhood is off limits and is patrolled by Navy seals and a Coast Guard cutter is positioned in the bay. It is one of the many security measures put in place, including military blockades on the beach and security checkpoints along the street where he stays. US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama light 26 candles, honoring the 26 students and teachers killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in the Map Rom of the White House in Washington, DC on December 14 . 'I understand he's the President and so he needs his security, but I'd like for him to pick next year another spot. This would be really nice,' said Madeline. 'At first it was exciting, but now it's no longer exciting.  It's maddening.' Last year, Obama was forced to cut short his vacation and fly back to Washington on the day after Christmas to resume negotiations on an emergency budget deal with Congress. This year, Congress is on track to approve a two-year budget deal before the Christmas holiday and so he isn't scheduled to return to Washington D.C. until January 5.","The First Family's are expected to spent their sixth Christmas in a row in Hawaii and will fly there later this week .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez has hinted that striker Samuel Eto'o could be on the verge of leaving Goodison Park. Martinez confirmed that the former Barcelona forward, who missed the Toffees' penalty shootout defeat at West Ham in the FA Cup on Tuesday, has been the subject of interest from two unnamed clubs. Eto'o only signed a two-year contract with Everton in August and has found the back of the net four times for the Toffees since then but has often found himself playing in a number 10 role and even out wide. Everton striker Samuel Eto'o signs autographs for the fans outside Goodison Park on Saturday . Everton manager Roberto Martinez gives instructions to his players during the FA Cup replay at West Ham . 'With Samuel, we have a really good relationship and we are looking at his situation,' Martinez said in the wake of Everton's 9-8 shootout defeat at the Boleyn Ground where the match ended 2-2 after extra-time. 'We had a couple of clubs contact us in the last 12 hours so I decided it was better now to leave him out of the squad and allow us a different focus in the group. 'We will decide (in the) next few days the next step. He's been fantastic for us, we've got a really good relationship and we will see what's (the) next best step for both (parties).' Eto'o scores for Everton against Burnley in the Premier League match at Turf Moor last October . If the former Cameroon international does leave Merseyside for pastures new his brace at Burnley in October will undoubtedly be the highlight of his time with the Blues. The 33-year-old's glancing header opened the scoring and then he capped off a fine display with a superb strike from 25 yards as the Toffees won 3-1 at Turf Moor. When asked if Eto'o has played his last game for the Toffees, Martinez added: 'No, I wouldn't say that.'","Everton manager Roberto Martinez has hinted Samuel Eto'o could leave .

"A mother-of-three has taken the drastic step of cancelling Christmas for her young sons after becoming exasperated by their disrespectful behavior and unchecked sense of entitlement. Lisa Henderson, from Hurricane, Utah, is using this coming holiday season to teach her boys - Caleb, 11, Davis, 8, and Beckham, 5 – that it is better to give than receive. The stay-at-home-mom, 36, recently wrote about the plan on her Over the Big Moon blog and says it was really her husband, 34-year-old John, who came up with the idea. Scroll down for video . Lisa Henderson's sons Caleb, 11, Davis, 8, and Beckham, 5, are going without ‘presents, Santa, and stockings’ this year in bid to learn that it is better to give than receive . ‘They had been acting up quite a bit, and weren't very grateful for the things they had,’ she told GMA. On her blog she explained that while the family weren't cancelling ‘putting up decorations, celebrating the birth of our Savior, or any of our other heart-warming traditions’, but they would be going without ‘presents, Santa, and stockings.’ Lisa and John felt their kids had lost sight of the fact that gifts aren’t an automatic entitlement and should be earned through good behavior. ‘Our kids have been acting so ungrateful lately. They expect so much even when their behavior is extremely disrespectful,’ she wrote. ‘We gave them good warning, either it was time for their behavior to change or there would be consequences. 'We patiently worked with them for several months and guess what, very little changed.’ On her blog Lisa Henderson explained that while the family weren't cancelling ‘putting up decorations, celebrating the birth of our Savior, or any of our other heart-warming traditions’, but they would be going without ‘presents, Santa, and stockings’ With Christmas now canceled, the money the parents would have spent on their three sons will instead be put towards gifts for others. ‘We are trying to teach them the pleasure of giving rather than continuing to feed their childhood desire for more,’ she wrote. Although the boys were initially very upset by the decision, Lisa says she is proud at how they have quickly learned to embrace the joy of giving - which was the original purpose of the exercise. ’They have reacted by making gifts for each other and sneaking them into each others stockings,' she wrote in an update to her original November 24 entitled ‘Why My Husband and I Cancelled Christmas’. 'They are learning exactly what we wanted them to learn, because they are not moping around feeling sorry for themselves. They are thinking of others.' The kids will also still receive parents from their grandparents and other family members. Lisa and John Henderson have taken the drastic step of canceling Christmas for her young sons after becoming exasperated by their disrespectful behavior and unchecked sense of entitlement . 'These will be more cherished because the quantity will be less.They can enjoy what they get rather than feel overstimulated with so much,' wrote their mom. Some of the good deeds the family are doing instead include sending used clothing and Halloween candy to a village in the Philippines that was hit by Typhoon Haiyan last year. The Henderson's are also looking into an Adopt a Grandparent program and will be joined for Christmas dinner by several older widows and couples near them who would otherwise be on their own. Lisa's post has also generated much discussion by readers of her blog and has received more than 600 comments. Some commenters have been outraged and accused Lisa of being 'mean' and 'a lazy parent,' while others have told her they think it is an excellent way to teach her children about the true meaning of Christmas.","Lisa Henderson, from Hurricane, Utah, is using this coming holiday season to teach her boys that it is better to give than receive .

"There have been times this season when Diego Costa has left his stamp on a game. This Capital One Cup semi-final was no exception. The goals, 17 of them so far in a Chelsea shirt, are a welcome distraction from an altogether different side to the forward’s game. This was a right old tear up, all blood and guts as these two teams took their rivalry, started by Luis Garcia’s ghost goal in the Champions League semi-final in 2005, to another level. Diego Costa of Chelsea stamps on Martin Skrtel of Liverpool during the first-half at Stamford Bridge . Chelsea striker was lucky to avoid punishment for this stamp on Liverpool defender Emre Can . It turned into a ‘he-started-it’ debate between the two managers at the end of this bruising second leg, but Costa is always picking a fight with somebody. He takes no prisoners. These teams spat and snarled at each other all night, kicking off when Costa left his studs in the ankle of Emre Can after they clashed by the touchline. For that he should have been sent off. Then there was the moment in extra-time, 102 minutes in when he wrapped his arms around the body of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard on the edge of their penalty area. Gerrard exploded, shoving his head into the face of Costa as players from both teams converged in yet another unfortunate scuffle. Somehow Gerrard escaped with a caution, as did the Chelsea forward. The feisty encounter saw many instances of confrontation like this between Steven Gerrard and Costa . This game, brilliantly poised at 1-1 following the first leg, was way too big for referee Michael Oliver. He was way out of his depth. Radio Five analyst Danny Mills repeatedly called him ‘a bottler’, referencing his failure to award Chelsea a penalty when Martin Skrtel clearly fouled Costa in the first half. Mourinho went potty, laying in to Phil Dowd, the fourth official, with another verbal battering and waiting for Oliver in the tunnel at the end of the first half. This is not the way to lodge a complaint, but Mourinho was at his petulant worst down there at times. Chelsea Manager Jose Mourinho argues with referee Michael Oliver at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers tells opposition boss Jose Mourinho to calm down on Tuesday . ‘If I speak, people will say it’s Mourinho,’ claimed Chelsea’s manager. ‘If I speak the FA will try to punish me like they always do, or try. But it’s clear when we win the game I still have to ask why.’ With apologies to former Wimbledon manager Bobby Gould for unashamedly appropriating a phrase he used about his 1988 FA Cup winners, Chelsea’s bench is the most badly behaved comprehensive in the country. They are an unruly bunch, constantly screaming in the face of Dowd or jumping up and down in the technical area when decisions do not go their way. Live with it, guys. We are used to it with Mourinho and the irritating figure of his No2 Rui Faria alongside him, but it is not becoming of Chelsea’s assistant coach Steve Holland. He is better than that. It is a credit to the any opposition manager - and Brendan Rodgers is included in this - if they can keep their cool when they are standing a yard or so away from Chelsea’s bench. Martin Skrtel of Liverpool argues with Diego Costa of Chelsea, as the pair continually clashed on Tuesday night . The provocation and antagonism is unreal at times, a test of patience for any one having to the put up with the constant chirping in the ear of the fourth official. They make anybody want to blow. The bell inside Mourinho’s head went again in the second half when Oliver should have booked Jordan Henderson for a second time when he deliberately handled. In La Liga, for example, it is a caution. There was needle all over the pitch, with Lucas Leiva setting the tone when he clattered into Cesc Fabregas as early as the eighth minute. Liverpool took no prisoners. The Chelsea midfielder was a passenger after that, finally succumbing just moments into the second half when he collided with his captain John Terry. Costa infuriated the Liverpool players after this blatant stamp on Liverpool's Emre Can in the first-half . Lucas was a lucky boy and Mourinho missed Chelsea’s goal, scored by Branislav Ivanovic (another player booked for tugging Raheem Sterling’s shirt) because he was still rabbiting in Dowd’s ear. He felt that Lucas should have been sent off for clogging Eden Hazard and he was probably right. In the end they scored in any event. ‘I was telling Dowd that Lucas and Henderson should have been sent off already for two yellow cards,’ admitted Mourinho. He was right, but this was a game when the sparks were flying between these two teams again. The rivalry is back on. ‘Costa is an outstanding footballer but he has an edge to him,’ admitted Rodgers. ‘You can see the incident with Can and he puts his studs on his ankle and it could have been nasty. The one with Skrtel, again, there is no need and he is clever enough if the officials don’t see it.’ As ever, it was Costa who left his mark.

"Islamic State fanatics claim to have constructed a dirty bomb after stealing 40kg of uranium from an Iraqi university. Militants boasted of the device on social media, with one even commenting on the destruction such a bomb would wreak in London, four months after the chemical was reported missing from Mosul University. Among extremists making online threats to the West is British explosives expert Hamayun Tariq, who fled his home in Dudley, West Midlands, for the Middle East in 2012. Scroll down for video . IS fanatics have boasted of a dirty bomb they say has been made using 40kg of uranium stolen from Mosul University, northern Iraq (pictured), in July when extremists took hold of the city . Using the Muslim name, Muslim-al-Britani, he posted on Twitter: 'O by the way Islamic State does have a Dirty bomb. We found some Radio active material from Mosul university,' the Mirror reports. He continued: 'We’ll find out what dirty bombs are and what they do. We’ll also discuss what might happen if one actually went off in a public area. 'This sort of a bomb would be terribly destructive if went off In LONDON becuz (sic) it would be more of a disruptive than a destructive weapon,' before having his Twitter account suspended. Other jihadis echoed the claims a destructive 'dirty bomb' had been made, with one writing: ' 'IS has confirmed that we have acquired a dirty bomb from radioactive material from Mosul Uni! Mashallah #IS'. Jihadis boasted of the device on Twitter. British-born Hamayun Tariq, who uses the Muslim name Muslim Al-Britani is thought to have threatened that the bomb may be detonated in London, though his account on the social media site has since been suspended . In July nearly 40kg of uranium stored for scientific research went missing from Mosul University in northern Iraq. In a letter to the United Nations, Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim told Ban Ki-moon 'Terrorist groups have seized control of nuclear material at the sites that came out of the control of the state,' adding such materials 'can be used in manufacturing weapons of mass destruction.' 'These nuclear materials, despite the limited amounts mentioned, can enable terrorist groups, with the availability of the required expertise, to use it separate or in combination with other materials in its terrorist acts.' Yesterday, as news the uranium had been used to construct a bomb, one jihadi taunted Iraq's reported plans to retake control of Mosul. Tariq claims to have been contacted by the terror group (pictured in northern Syria) from his Pakistani home . Extremists are thought to have paid for him to travel to Syria where they operate in large numbers . 'Plan to retake Mosul from ISIS emerges, haha! Little do they know the resources of #IS! Good luck!' they wrote. Earlier this year,  Tariq claimed to have had his passport cancelled by the Home Office after travelling to the Middle East. The former car mechanic fled to Pakistan almost immediately after being released from prison in 2012. After pledging his allegiance to the Taliban, he claimed to have been recruited by IS fighters who paid for him to travel to Syria to join them. The Home Office would not speak to Tariq's claims, saying it did not comment on individual cases.","Chemical was stolen from Mosul University, northern Iraq, in July .

The unidentified boy's mother, Jasmin Briana Moore, of Mableton, and William Chester Hickson, of Atlanta, were arrested and each charged with cruelty to children in the first degree . The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that the boy was unresponsive when authorities found him, and had stopped breathing before he was taken to Children Healthcare of Atlanta.

Today, a triple suicide bombing in Iraq killed 26 Kurdish security forces north-east of Baghdad and a roadside bomb killed Anbar province's police chief. The attack reportedly took place in Qara Tappah, with the first bomber detonating an explosives vest at the gateway to a security compound. Minutes later, two suicide bombers ploughed explosive-filled cars into the compound. At least 60 people were wounded in the attack, claimed by ISIS.

Sitting: The extremist group has carved out a vast stretch of territory from northern Syria to near Baghdad . The U.S. military said yesterday it launched airstrikes north and west of Baghdad, hitting a small ISIS fighting unit and destroying armed vehicles. It said Britain participated in the airstrikes. New York-based Human Rights Watch meanwhile said militants from ISIS are holding hundreds of Yazidi captives, including women and children, in detention facilities in Iraq and Syria. Based on accounts by relatives of detainees, it said the group has systematically separated young women and teenage girls from their families and has forced some of them to marry its fighters. Hundreds of people from the Yazidi religious minority were killed and tens of thousands were forced to flee for their lives after militants overran their hometown of Sinjar in north-west Iraq in August.

Also today, activists claimed Kurdish fighters have halted ISIS’s advance in the Syrian border town of Kobani, where the U.S.-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes for two weeks. The Syrian Kurdish enclave has been the scene of heavy fighting since last month, with the heavily armed ISIS fighters trying to capture the border post and deal a blow to the coalition air campaign. The extremist group has carved out a vast stretch of territory stretching hundreds of miles from northern Syria to the outskirts of Baghdad and imposed a harsh version of Islamic rule. The fighters have massacred hundreds of captured Iraqi and Syrian soldiers, terrorised religious minorities, and beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers. Since the offensive on Kobani began, 550 people have been killed, including about 300 ISIS fighters, 225 Kurdish gunmen and 20 civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

"A woman whose eleven-month-old daughter was raped and killed by her then-boyfriend in 1997 does not want the Oklahoma man responsible to be executed, it has emerged. Shonda Waller said death row inmate Charles Warner should instead spend the rest of his life behind bars in a recent interview with KFOR. 'If they truly want to honor me, then they will do away with the death penalty for him, and they will give him life in prison without the possibility of parole, because that's the only thing that's gonna honor me,' she told the affiliate station. 'I can only see him spending the rest of his life in prison and dying in prison, without him ever walking out of those cell walls.' Scroll down for video . Mother: Shonda Waller, pictured, has said Charles Warner, who was convicted of raping and killing her daughter, should spend the rest of his life behind bars as opposed to being killed . Victim: Adrianna Waller, pictured, was killed by Warner . Warner, whose execution is planned for this January, was convicted of both rape as well as first-degree murder two years after his 1997 arrest, KFOR reported. He was prosecuted by Oklahoma County Assistant District Attorney Lou Keel that year, as well as in 2002 and 2003, according to the affiliate station. Keel told KFOR 'Charles Warner was convicted twice by juries and given the death penalty each time and given 75 years for the sexual assault.' Keel also said of Warner 'This person doesn’t deserve to live. If you’re going to have a death penalty, if there are going to be some crimes, some homicides, that are so atrocious... then the rape and the brutal murder of a child has to qualify.' Shonda Waller opposed the death penalty for Warner while she spoke in a March 2014 clemency hearing, the affiliate station reported. Death row inmate: Charles Warner's execution is planned for this January . She told KFOR 'I don't see any justice in just sentencing someone to die. To me, the justice is in someone living with what they have done to you, to your family, and having to live with that for the rest of their life, knowing that they'll never walk out those bars.' ACLU Legal Director Brad Henderson supported Waller's views, telling the affiliate station 'I think she hits it right on the head when she says you know what, this person took life, this person murdered. This person killed. Now we’re just doing the same thing in my baby’s name. That’s wrong. That’s fundamentally wrong. Speaking about the death penalty, Waller also told KFOR 'That would dishonor my daughter; it would dishonor me and everything and I believe in. Um, I wouldn't want to have to know about something like that because I wouldn't want to know that my hand or what I went through personally is the reason why he's no longer living. When he dies, I want it to be because it's his time, not because he's been executed due to what happened to me and my child. 'And I don't want that on my hands. I makes me feel like I'm no different than him, and I don't want to feel that way.'","Shonda Waller's eleven-month-old daughter Adrianna Waller was raped and killed in 1997 .

"NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and his officers were sprayed with  fake blood while walking among demonstrators protesting against the grand jury decision in the Ferguson shooting. The commissioner was left with the red liquid splattered across his face, after a protester threw a bag of the fake blood at him and his entourage in Times Square, New York. Another officer was hit by the red liquid, which was seen covering his face and shirt as the surrounding crowd scattered. Scroll down for videos . Police Commissioner Bill Bratton was left with the red liquid splattered across his face, after a protester threw a bag of the fake blood at him and his entourage in Times Square, New York . Another officer was also hit by the bag red liquid, which was seen covering his face and shirt as the surrounding crowd scattered in Times Square . Paint protest: Diego Ibanez (center) is led away after allegedly splattering a police officer with imitation blood in Times Square during the Ferguson protest . Diego Ibanez, 26, is expected to appear in court on Tuesday after he was arrested for allegedly throwing the blood. Mr Ibanez, who is originally from Bolivia, is a onetime Occupy Wall Street protester, according to the Daily News. Several thousand people had marched from Union Square to Times Square to protest a grand jury's decision not to indict the white police officer who shot dead 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Police told CBS2 they were aware of the incident involving Commissioner Bratton, but could not immediately confirm any information. There were several arrests and an unspecified number of police officers had suffered minor injuries. A few hours before the grand jury decision on Monday night, another group of protesters had gathered outside NYU Law School where Bratton was speaking. The New Yorkers Against Bratton are calling for the commissioner's resignation, after an NYPD officer shot and killed a man in a public housing stairwell in Brooklyn last week. A bloody tribute: One protester used the fake blood to write out Mike Brown's name on the ground in Times Square . Akai Gurley, 28, was shot and killed in a darkened stairwell at the Louis H. Pink Houses in East New York on Thursday night by officer Peter Liang as he conducted a floor-by-floor sweep of the building. Bratton called the shooting a tragic accident and said Gurley was a 'total innocent'. He said Mr Gurley had lost his life because of a 'coincidence'. There is also fury over the case of Staten Island man Eric Garner, 43, who died in July after cops put him in a chokehold while he yelled 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe'. The incident, in which he was surrounded by five officers who claimed to have seen him selling untaxed cigarettes on the street, was all caught on a cellphone video camera. The grand jury is still hearing evidence on his case. Killed by cops: Akai Gurley, 28, left, was shot and killed by a rookie officer in a darkened stairwell at the Louis H.

A man holds a sign with images of Eric Garner and Michael Brown as protesters begin to rally in New York after the grand jury reached a decision on Monday night . 'The lives of people of color, young black men of color, young women of color, poor people - they are not respected and valued by the NYPD,' Josmar Truillo from New Yorkers Against Bratton told the Huffington Post. 'Connecting the dots between Brooklyn, Staten island and Ferguson is exactly what the mayor of this city does not want us to do and that's something we must make sure happens,' he added, noting that Mayor Bill de Blasio  said that Gurley's death should not be compared to other instances of alleged police brutality. Josmar Trujillo, a member of New Yorkers Against Bratton, protests outside an event where New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton was speaking on Monday night. Trujillo and others are calling for the resignation of Bratton after an NYPD officer shot and killed a man in a public housing stairwell in Brooklyn . Protesters demonstrating the grand jury decision in New York held up signs reading 'Black lives matter' and 'Jail killer cops,' and chanted 'Hands up, don't shoot' and 'No justice, no peace' as they walked to Times Square. Traffic on New York City bridges was  shut down as demonstrators marched in traffic lanes over the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Triboro bridges. Activists had been planning to protest even before the night-time announcement that Officer Darren Wilson will not be charged in the shooting death of Michael Brown. The racially charged case in Ferguson has inflamed tensions and reignited debates over police-community relations even in cities hundreds of miles from the predominantly black St. Louis suburb. Thousands of protesters march up Seventh Avenue through oncoming traffic to Time Square to protest the St. Louis County grand jury decision not to bring criminal charges against Darren Wilson . Philip Arone, a member of 'New Yorkers Against Bratton,' protests outside an event where New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton was speaking on Monday . Police departments in several major cities said they were bracing for large demonstrations with the potential for the kind of violence that marred nightly protests in Ferguson after Brown's killing. Demonstrators there vandalized police cars, hugged barricades and taunted officers with expletives Monday night while police fired smoke canisters and pepper spray. Gunshots were heard on the streets. But police elsewhere reported that gatherings were mostly peaceful immediately following Monday's announcement. Other signs included pictures of both Michael Brown and Eric Garner, the local Staten Island man who died in July after being put in a choke hold by police during an arrest. Protesters were penned in an area at the northern end of the square, behind a ring of police officers. They pushed the metal police barriers aside and yelled, 'No justice, no peace, no racist police.'

"A robber who stumbled and shot a medical student as he raided a fraternity residence has been found guilty of murder. Dajeon Franklin, 22, had no reaction when a jury convicted him of killing 25-year-old Paul DeWolf in Michigan University's Phi Rho Sigma house last year. He was also found guilty of three home invasions and unlawful possession of a firearm. Relief: Paul DeWolf's family hugged as Dajeon Franklin, 22, was found guilty of his murder last July . Killed: Paul DeWolf, an aspiring pilot, was sleeping in his basement bedroom when the three men broke in . Washtenaw County Court heard Franklin and two friends, 20-year-old Joei Jordan, and 21-year-old Shaquille Jones, broke into the medical fraternity in the early hours of July 24, 2013, and stumbled upon DeWolf sleeping in his basement bedroom. DeWolf and Franklin struggled, and the gun Franklin was holding went off, striking DeWolf in the neck, prosecutors said. DeWolf's body was found at the fraternity house on July 24, 2013, after he failed to show up for work at a hospital. 'That was very hard,' Paul DeWolf's father Thom DeWolf told Mlive after the verdict. 'You're sitting on pins and needles waiting for the answer. You think there would be some elation or happiness, but there's not. All it does, it's confirming Paul's death.' Robbery: Franklin got in a fight with DeWolf as he and two friends raided the residence at Michigan University . Shot: The gun Franklin was holding went off and hit DeWolf in the neck. DeWolf was found dead the next day . Walter White, Franklin's lawyer, questioned the evidence presented against his client, asking during his closing argument: 'What evidence do we have that Dajeon Franklin was even there and even part of this?' Franklin will be sentenced November 19. His friends and family members left the courtroom in tears, while DeWolf's supporters celebrated with hugs. Tragic: Paul DeWolf's sister Rebekah hugs a detective after Franklin was convicted of murder . DeWolf was from the southwestern Michigan community of Schoolcraft and a graduate of Grand Valley State University. He was a reservist second lieutenant and had planned to join the Air Force full time after graduation.

"A new diagnostic test for the Ebola virus which produces results in 15 minutes is set to be trialled in Guinea - the epicentre of the current outbreak. The new test is six times faster than those currently used, and aims to speed up the diagnosis of cases. It will be trialled in a treatment centre in Conakry, the West African nation's capital. Early detection of the virus leads to better infection control as medical staff can identify and isolate confirmed cases of Ebola faster, and start treating patients sooner. Ultimately it is hoped a faster test will reduce the spread of the highly contagious disease, and slow the spiralling death rates. More than 5,600 people have died during the current outbreak, according to the World Health Organisation. Scroll down for video . A new test for Ebola, which produces results within 15 minutes, will be trialled at a treatment centre in Conakry, the capital of Guinea. Pictured, health workers carry a suspected patient to a centre for treatment . The vast majority of victims are from Guinea, where the epidemic started in December last year, and neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia. The new trial is one of six health research projects that have been jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and the UK Government's Department for International Development. Led by researchers at the Pasteur Institute in Dakar, Senegal, the new test will be deployed using a 'mobile suitcase laboratory', which is designed for settings where there are few resources. The portable lab includes a solar panel, a power pack and a results reader, the size of a small laptop. The reagent substance used in the test are available as dried pellets, meaning they can be used and transported at room temperature. Similarly to the tests currently in use, the new diagnostic tool detects the genetic material of the virus. The pilot trial will test whether the reagent substance is safe and effective to use with Ebola patients' blood and saliva samples. Dr Val Snewin, international activities manager at the Wellcome Trust, said: 'A reliable, 15-minute test that can confirm cases of Ebola would be a key tool for effective management of the Ebola outbreak - allowing patients to be identified, isolated and cared for as soon as possible. 'It not only gives patients a better chance of survival, but it prevents transmission of the virus to other people. The virus has killed more than 5,600 people - the vast majority in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia . It is hoped the new test will help speed up diagnosis, meaning patients can be treatment quicker. Ultimately, the aim is to slow transmission and halt the death rate. A suspected Ebola patient is taken to a centre in Patrice near Macenta in Guinea . 'This pilot study is particularly promising because researchers have considered how to make the test suitable for use in remote field hospitals, where resources - such as electricity and cold storage - are often in short supply.' International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'Britain's first Ebola laboratory is already up and running in Sierra Leone and two more are currently being constructed. 'Together these will quadruple the number of tests that can be carried out every day and helping contain the spread of Ebola. 'The UK is doing everything possible to help the Government of Sierra Leone tackle and ultimately defeat Ebola. 'Funding this ground-breaking research will develop new ways of diagnosing suspected cases even more quickly and stop more people suffering from this deadly virus.' Funding for these projects has been made available from an existing £6.5 million research initiative, Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC), which is jointly funded by DFID and the Wellcome Trust.","New diagnostic tool yields results within 15 minutes, scientists say .

"From the recently expanded family enclosure at Newcastle United, a dad and lad can watch the biggest names in all 19 Barclays Premier League games at St James’ Park for £417. Granted, Sergio Aguero, Radamel Falcao, Alexis Sanchez and Diego Costa will not be playing in the black and white stripes of Newcastle, but they are among the star attractions at this sporting cathedral. Newcastle’s family section has a capacity of 8,200 and is the biggest in the Premier League, possibly in Europe, too. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pardew on the edge . Newcastle supporters are in revolt but the club are trying things to attempt to win them back . Behind the scenes the staff are proud of their relationship with the thriving generation of the club's supporters. A five-game package, starting this Saturday against Hull City and followed by Leicester, Liverpool, QPR and Chelsea, starts at £105 for adults, £25 for juniors. They are putting the fans first. Sadly Mike Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United, has put newspaper groups and the reporters who work for them last, but we will come back to that. This Saturday, when the team bottom of the Premier League take on Steve Bruce’s Hull, the atmosphere inside St James’ Park threatens to be venomous. Everybody, it seems, is out for Ashley and his manager Alan Pardew. All is not well, that much is clear after a 4-0 defeat at Southampton (where they were beaten by the same score last season) led to one banner proclaiming ‘Pardew is a Muppet’. Since January 1, this team have won just five games in the Premier League (West Ham, Aston Villa, Hull, Crystal Palace and Cardiff). All of them were last season. Over the weekend, when Ashley spoke with Pardew following their thumping at St Mary’s, the owner told him he would not be judged on the four league games they have played this season.. In any event there is a penalty clause in the eight-year contract Pardew signed in September 2012 and he will be entitled to £5m in compensation should Ashley decide to sack him. Some statistics on Ashley’s regime: in the accounts published in February, Newcastle’s wage bill is down to 64 per cent of turnover (down from 91 per cent when he took over in May 2007). They paid £61.7m in salaries last season, falling into line with Financial Fair Play regulations. Ashley cannot be faulted for prudence and he won’t blow his brains out paying super-sized salaries when the club doesn’t have the income to sustain them. Newcastle fans made their feelings known during the 4-0 defeat at Southampton with this banner . The Newcastle supporters have reached the end of their tether with Pardew and most want him out . VIDEO Pardew on the edge . Newcastle's horrible 2014 so far... January 1 - West Brom (a) lost 1-0 . January 18 - West Ham (a) won 3-1 . January 28 - Norwich (a) drew 0-0 .

August 17 - Man City (h) lost 2-0 . August 23 - Aston Villa (a) drew 0-0 . August 30 - C Palace (h) drew 3-3 . September 13 - Southampton (a) lost 4 - 0 . An interest-free loan from the owner of £129m is still showing on the financial statement for the 2012-13 season. It is the only significant debt at the club. The days of PAs for the PAs are long gone in an era of financial restrictions and responsibilities at Newcastle. Back to Pardew. There is a hangover from last season, when seven defeats in the last eight games in the Premier League set the tone. After Yohan Cabaye, easily the club’s most influential player, was sold to Paris Saint-Germain for £19m on January 29, the team jacked it in for the season. Pardew’s shameful headbutt on David Meyler in March (leading to a £100,000 fine from the club, a formal warning and a touchline ban) affected his standing in the dressing room. Winning it back will not be easy. The manager's frustrations in the transfer market this summer, missing out on Bafetimbi Gomis (now at Swansea) and Toby Alderweireld (Southampton), are the life of a manager. You win some, you lose some. So far a clutch of new signings - Darryl Janmaat, Remy Cabella, Emmanuel Riviere and Ayoze Perez - have shown little so far. Still, it is early days for all of them. This is not a vintage Newcastle team by any stretch of the imagination, but new signings - particularly from overseas - deserve time to settle. For every Angel di Maria there is a Florin Raducioiu. Mike Ashley has been criticised by Newcastle United fans but has been prudent with the club's finances . Much has been made of Pardew’s failure to take the team beyond the fourth round of either the FA Cup or League Cup since his arrival in December 2010. Fair enough, but two years ago they played 14 matches in the Europa League before they were finally beaten by Benfica in the quarter-final. In isolation, 12th, fifth, 16th and 10th placed finishes in the Premier League doesn’t seem so bad. In terms of expectations, Newcastle fans demand the very best from the team, just like every other group of supporters. That is no crime. The manager is not popular, that much is clear with the various campaigns designed to unseat him from one of the most prestigious jobs in football. So what of Ashley? He’s taken to banning newspapers, which is a shame because he’s had bigger battles over the years than a few issues with the press. ‘Media froth’, as some communications directors at Premier League clubs have taken to calling the fascination with every day-to-day detail, is part of the game. The sparkle is missing at St James’ Park, something Pardew is acutely aware of as he approaches this weekend’s clash with Hull. After four years of fall-outs, the idea of a family get-together is a long way off. Pardew (right) shows the strain as his Newcastle side are given a thrashing at Southampton .","Newcastle supporters want rid of Mike Ashley and Alan Pardew .

"North Korea's increasingly fragile relationship with the outside world is being further threatened by an obscure Japanese rock band who have released a song insulting Korean women. The song, by a band called Scramble, addresses the sensitive issue of 'comfort women' - the name given to the women forced into prostitution by the Japanese in the Second World War. The release of the song comes at a turbulent time - Kim Jong-un leader of North Korea has been issuing increasingly threatening messages to countries which he perceives as enemies of the rogue state. Scroll down for video . Threat: North Korea's increasingly fragile relationship with the outside world is being further threatened by an obscure Japanese rock band who have released a song insulting Korean women . Controversial: Scramble is an ultra-right and little-known band in Japan, but they seem determined to boost their profile with the stunt . The song called Slashing Koreans has a . video to go with it and mocks and encourages violence against the . surviving women, who are now in their 80s and 90s. Scramble is an ultra-right and little-known band in Japan, but they seem determined to boost their profile with the stunt. A CD of the inflammatory song and a translated text was sent to a shelter for the surviving 'comfort women' in Gwangiu, south of Seoul, South Korea, last week. As a result, a group of eight elderly former 'comfort women' has filed a defamation suit against the Japanese band, in a move that will only fan the flames of Korean dissatisfaction with other nations.

Agency, dedicated a whole day's editorial to it, in an unusual break . from its daily fare of criticising America. After the war, many of the women were brutally slaughtered and their story was first told in 1991.

Hostile: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been making increasingly dramatic threats towards what he perceives as enemies . The authorities believed the comfort system would enhance the morale of the military and help prevent soldiers from committing sexual violence toward women of occupied territories, which became a real concern after the infamous Nanjing Massacre in 1937. They were also concerned with the health of the troops, which prompted close supervision of the hygienic conditions in the comfort stations to help keep STDs under control. When the war ended, the only military tribunal concerning the sexual abuse of comfort women took place in Batavia (now Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia) in 1948. Several Japanese military officers were convicted for having forced the 35 Dutch women involved in the case into comfort stations. The issue began to emerge in Korea only in the late 1980s. The Japanese government admitted deception, coercion and official involvement in the recruitment of comfort women in August 1993, but critics said they needed to go much further. After Japan's surrender it is reported that it set up a similar system there for American GIs, with tacit approval from U.S. authorities, .

"Ancient Egyptians were mummifying their dead 1,500 years earlier than previously thought. Traces of complex embalming agents were found in linen used to wrap bodies that were placed in tombs in one of the earliest recorded ancient Egyptian cemeteries. The formula used to treat the cloth predates the earliest scientific evidence of embalming in the area of northern Egypt by more than a millennium. Traces of complex embalming agents were found in linen used to wrap bodies that were placed in tombs in one of the earliest recorded ancient Egyptian cemeteries, showing the the ancient Egyptians mummified their dead 1,500 years earlier than thought. Grave 408 in the cemetery at Mostagedda is pictured . Experts identified a pine resin, an aromatic plant extract, a plant gum, a natural petroleum source and a plant oil or animal fat in the funerary wrappings in unopened tombs at Mostagedda, in the region of Upper Egypt. The embalming agents that were found make up a similar recipe to those used at the zenith of Pharaonic mummification around 3,000 years later. The textile sample is held in the British museum and was collected in the 1930s, according to the study published in Plos One. Academics say that the 11-year study, which also involved Macquarie University in Australia, rewrites our understanding of the ancient civilisation. Traditional theories on ancient Egyptian mummification suggest that in prehistory - the Late Neolithic and Predynastic periods between around 4,500 and 3,100 BC - bodies dried naturally through the action of the hot, dry desert sand. The formula used to treat the cloth predates the earliest scientific evidence of embalming in the area by more than a millennium. The embalming agents make up a similar recipe to those used at the zenith of Pharaonic mummification around 3,000 years later. This ancient flax is heavily impregnated with resin . Experts identified a pine resin, an aromatic plant extract, a plant gum, a natural petroleum source and a plant oil or animal fat in the funerary wrappings in unopened tombs at Mostagedda. This cloth has been treated with multiple layers of resin . Embalming was practiced for over 2,000 years and was an important after life ritual. Religious ceremonies accompanied the preparation of the body for the afterlife. Priests wrapped the mummy with linen strips containing resin, placed the internal organs in the specially prepared canopic jars and blessed the entrance of the mummy’s tomb at the funeral. The mummified remains remain in good condition because the process successfully removed moisture from the body to slow down the process of decay. The Ancient Egyptians believed the body was the house of the soul so even after death the spirit could only live on if the body was preserved forever. If the body decayed, so too did the soul. In Ancient Egyptian religion, the soul was made of the ka, which remained in the tomb, the ba, which was free to fly outside the tomb and the akh which travelled to the underworld for judgement. Early use of resins in artificial mummification has, until now, been limited to isolated occurrences during the late Old Kingdom in around 2,200 BC. The practice became more popular during the Middle Kingdom between 2,000 and 1,600 BC. Dr Stephen Buckley, a Research Fellow at the University of York, conducted the chemical analyses of the balm. ‘The antibacterial properties of some of these ingredients and the localised soft-tissue preservation that they would have afforded lead us to conclude that these represent the very beginnings of experimentation that would evolve into the mummification practice of the Pharaonic period,’ he said. ‘Having previously led research on embalming agents employed in mummification during Egypt’s Pharaonic period it was notable that the relative abundances of the constituents are typical of those used in mummification throughout much of ancient Egypt’s 3,000 year Pharaonic history. ‘These resinous recipes applied to the prehistoric linen wrapped bodies contained antibacterial agents, used in the same proportions employed by the Egyptian embalmers when their skill was at its peak, some 2,500 to 3,000 years later.’ Professor Thomas Higham, who was responsible for dating the burials at the University of Oxford, said: ‘This work demonstrates the huge potential of material in museum collections to allow researchers to unearth new information about the archaeological past. ‘Using modern scientific tools our work has helped to illuminate a key aspect of the early history of ancient Egypt.’ The linen was wrapped around bodies laid to rest at at ancient city of Mostagedda (marked on the map) in the region of Upper Egypt, which is home to one of the earliest recorded ancient Egyptian cemeteries . Early use of resins in artificial mummification has, until now, been limited to isolated occurrences during the late Old Kingdom in around 2,200 BC.

"These shocking images reveal the true extent of a 'filthy, stinking' hotel which tried to fine a couple  for leaving a negative review on TripAdvisor. The Broadway Hotel in Blackpool charged retired van driver Tony Jenkinson, 63, and his 64-year-old wife Jan £100 extra after they described the establishment as a 'rotten stinking hovel' in their damning online review. The review sparked a row between the couple and the hotel, which said it operated a 'no bad review policy', as stated in its terms and conditions. But now these photos, taken inside the hotel, offer a glimpse into the conditions with which the pair faced during their one-night stay. Scroll down for video .

Another image shows a person's worn socks  left languishing in a drawer in one of the bedrooms . Retired van driver Tony Jenkinson (left) and his wife Jan (right) described the Broadway Hotel in Blackpool as a 'rotten stinking hovel' The images, from TripAdvisor, show peeling paintwork, cracked plaster, a dirty shower - and even a pair of worn socks left languishing in one of the bedroom drawers. It comes as the couple, who have been fighting to recoup the money through their credit card company, are said to be expecting a refund. The review, which was posted in August, branded the hotel a 'filthy, dirty rotten stinking hovel'. Mr Jenkinson, from Whitehaven, Cumbria, wrote: 'The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the carpet was thin, dirty and stained. The bed was something else, it must have come out of the ark.' He added: 'This place should be shut down, I don't know if they are ever inspected, but if so, I don't know how this place has passed!' Previous reviewers had despaired over 'bedrooms full of mould' and 'staff drinking cans of Strongbow while serving breakfast' at the hotel, which is ranked at 858 out of 894 places to stay in the seaside resort. Sharon W wrote: 'Don't go there.' Jeanette M, from Derby, added: 'A bedroom full of mould, no heater, no hot water. Staff drinking cans of Strongbow while serving breakfast.' And Dolores C, from York, wrote simply: 'Words fail me. Terrible, terrible, terrible.' Blackpool Council said today that they understood that the hotel will reimburse Mr and Mrs Jenkinson, as well as scrapping the policy. The Blackpool establishment fined a couple £100 for writing a negative review about the business on TripAdvisor - despite these images which show the state of the hotel .

He added that the place should be shut down and questionned how it had ever passed an inspection . Gillian Campbell, cabinet member responsible for public protection at the local authority, said: 'Our trading standards team became aware of this issue last week. 'As a result, we have spoken to the hotel owner and asked for the policy to be removed, which has now happened. This is a unique case and not one that we have come across before.' The controversy emerged after couple stopped at the hotel on their way to Oxford, where they paid £36 for a night in a double room. But they said they encountered a string of problems, prompting Mr Jenkinson to post the review on August 30 in which he branded the hotel a 'filthy, dirty, rotten, stinking hovel'. The Jenkinsons said they discovered the £100 charge on their credit card statement a few days later.

The hotel, which is shown with stained carpets, is ranked at 858 out of 894 places to stay in the seaside resort . In his review, Mr Jenkinson described the bed as 'something else' and 'coming out of the ark' But when they queried the charge, they were said to have been told it was incurred under a 'no bad review policy' included in the terms and conditions. The hotel's policy said: 'Despite the fact that repeat customers and couples love our hotel, your friends and family may not. For every bad review left on any website, the group organiser will be charged a maximum £100 per review. The couple then complained to Cumbria trading standards officials, who passed the matter to counterparts in Blackpool. John Greenbank, trading standards area manager north, said: 'I have worked for trading standards for many years and have never seen anything like this. This image shows lose wires stretching across the rooms, connecting to the back of the television . This photo shows piles of linen left around the hotel, blocking the main communal areas . Several reviewers have complained about cracks in the plaster on the walls of the hotel . 'The hotel management clearly thinks that they have come up with a novel way to prevent bad reviews. However, we believe this could be deemed an unfair trading practice.' Tim Coglan, head of Blackpool's Trading Standards, said: 'We have met with the hotel management and from now on this clause which they ask people to sign when they book in alongside other terms and conditions will be removed.' A spokesman at the hotel said: 'Yes there have been talks with the council. I do not wish to say anything more.' Councillor John McCreesh said: 'Customers need to be free to be honest about the service they're getting. 'Other customers depend upon it. Hotel owners should focus on getting their service right rather than shutting down aggrieved customers with threats and fines. The Broadway Hotel (pictured) in Blackpool fined the couple £100 for writing a negative review on TripAdvisor . 'People should have the right to vent their disappointment if a hotel stay did not meet their expectations and should not be prevented from having their say.' The hotel could not be reached for comment. Its website appeared to be down. TripAdvisor spokesman James Kay said: 'While, thankfully, such instances are very rare, it is completely against the spirit and policies of our site for any business owner to attempt to bully or intimidate reviewers who have had a negative experience. 'Where we find evidence of a business doing so, we will take action to protect the integrity of our site.' The hotel is still open open for business. At reception there was a large notice stating: 'We no longer take verbal abuse as tips'. It also warns that people who use the car park without permission must pay a £300 tow-away fee.

"The aunt of convicted rapist Ched Evans has criticised the footballer for not showing any remorse. Nina Evans, 56, urged her disgraced nephew - who has always maintained his innocence - to apologise to his victim. The addiction counsellor from St Albans, Hertfordshire, said: ‘He deserved to go down as he was found guilty - he did rape her.’ Scroll down for video . No remorse: Ched Evans (left) broke his silence this week to apologise to his girlfriend Natasha Massey (right) She told The Sun journalist Ruth Warrander: ‘Ched won’t grasp or listen. He won’t admit he’s done wrong. He’ll never show remorse.’ Ched Evans, 25, has maintained his innocence despite being found guilty of rape and spending two and a half years in jail. The angry attack by his aunt comes just days after he broke his silence for the first time this week to apologise to his girlfriend Natasha Massey, 25. But he was criticised for not mentioning his victim - who had previously been named by trolls on Twitter and forced to change her name as a result. Ched Evans has always claimed it was ‘consensual and not rape’. In response to the video published on his website, Nina Evans, who sometimes works with rape victims, said: ‘It cut me like a knife. I hoped he’d come to his senses and say the right thing. Playing for Sheffield United: Ched Evans, 25, has maintained his innocence despite being found guilty of rape . 'What about his poor victim? It’s a massive insult to her.’ Chiefs at Ched Evans’s former football club have banned sales of shirts with his name printed on the back, it was claimed today. The store at Sheffield United’s ground Bramall Lane is allegedly refusing requests from fans for the number 9 and his surname on newly-purchased £45 replica kits. Speaking to Daily Mirror reporters Jeremy Armstrong and Paul Byrne, a club spokesman said: ‘We will not print shirts with his name on if we believe it is in connection with him.’ Sheffield United, who are in League One, have denied offering the player a new contract but refused to rule out signing him again. Nina Evans added that he had complained about his jail release terms that stopped him from going on holiday with Natasha. She said: ‘He cried like a baby to his mum. He thinks Natasha’s the victim.’ Meanwhile, it was claimed that Ched Evans is writing a book which he plans to publish if he wins an appeal to overturn his rape conviction. The former Wales striker reportedly began his autobiography after being jailed. As a convicted prisoner he cannot profit from any book sales, but could donate them to a charity. A source close to Ched Evans told Daily Star reporter Jerry Lawton: ‘Ched reckons his story would make a very powerful book. 'The court case, conviction, being sent down and how his girlfriend has stuck by him is explosive material. But he realises that the book would only work if he is eventually cleared.’","Nina Evans, 56, urged her disgraced nephew to apologise to his victim .

"With its stunning limestone cliffs towering over stilt houses surrounded by azure waters, the island of Panyee is a typical Thai paradise. But it's not mother nature drawing tourists here - it's a floating football pitch. Thailand's tourism industry has taken a battering this year following months of protests, the May military coup, the subsequent imposition of martial law and the murder of two young Britons on the holiday isle of Koh Tao in September. Youngsters play football on a floating football pitch in Koh Panyee, Thailand's Phang Nga province . Tourists leave Koh Panyee on long-tail boats, where the football pitch has helped the local economy . The Immigration Bureau says there has been a near nine per cent drop in tourist arrivals between January and October compared to the same period in 2013 - a painful blow for the millions of Thais whose livelihoods depend on the industry. But in Panyee, part of Thailand's picturesque Phanga Nga province, foreign visitors keep coming thanks to excitement over the community's innovative and highly unusual football pitch. Nestled next to the largely Muslim island's ferry pier, the 50 by 80 foot pitch has become something of a national treasure after an advertising campaign by a Thai bank in 2010 made the fishing community locally famous for their dedication to football. 'What do you do when you come to Panyee Island? You must see the floating football pitch,' beams island chief Muhammad Prasanpan, who says 50,000-70,000 baht (£1,000-£1,400) now comes in from tourists each day. The development has moved on from playing on a rickety floating mesh of wood and nails . The island's younger inhabitants are now encouraged to stay and be a part of 'the football team' That represents a five-fold income increase for the 320 household-island since a decade ago when fishing was its mainstay, the chief says. The island has long had a reputation for football-obsessed inhabitants who have refused to let something as inconvenient as a complete lack of flat surfaces hold them back from practising the 'Beautiful Game'. Originally islanders played on a beach, but could only do so during low tide when enough sand was visible. The first floating pitch was built 30-years ago but was a dangerous hotchpotch of wooden boards knocked together with rusty nails. 'We had to avoid nails coming up. It was risky and dangerous. But we had to play on it because we had no pitch,' recalls boat driver  Prakit Prasanpan, sporting the local team's shirt. Panyee has become famous both locally - and increasingly internationally - for football . Inspired by their dedication, TMB Bank commissioned a series of adverts charting the local team's success in a football tournament despite the rickety pitch. After the campaign aired the islanders, with help from local authorities, built themselves a new - and crucially nail-free - floating pitch. Since those adverts aired in 2011, Panyee has become famous both locally - and increasingly internationally - for football. But the pitch has done more than attract new arrivals. It has kept the island's younger inhabitants from leaving. Depopulation is often a major problem in Thailand's poor communities, with youngsters travelling significant distances to find better paid work -- usually to support large families back home. In Panyee the young are staying put. The island's population has increased to 1,800 from 1,200 over the last 10 years. 'Jobs here are better than on the mainland - the young can find money more easily here, they can earn thousands of baht driving canoes,' explains 74-year-old Aporn Janchulee, a market stall holder. Local will be hoping the tourists get involved with the floating football pitch - and then spend their money . But other tourist hotspots are not so fortunate. Between January and October tourism income in Thailand fell 6.1 per cent compared to the same period last year to 905 million baht (£17.5 billion). With so many reliant on tourism in a country that dubs itself the 'Land of Smiles', Thailand's generals know they must restore confidence. The junta have vowed to 'Return beaches to the people' - a side project of their wider promise to 'Return happiness to Thailand'. The first clean-up campaign was launched in the large resort island of Phuket where the authorities took down unregistered umbrella and food stalls. But while the campaign restored a more pristine look to some of Phuket's beaches, it angered many local businesses. Tourism in Thailand has been affected by murders and a military coup that has seen a nine per cent fall . Meanwhile the junta's attempts to bolster tourism were dealt a blow by the September murder of David Miller, 24, and the rape and murder of Hannah Witheridge, 23, on Koh Tao. The authorities have charged two Myanmar nationals with killing the British pair but they later retracted their confessions, alleging they were obtained under duress. Thailand's junta leader Prayut Chan-O-Cha also caused widespread dismay after the murders when he suggested that attractive foreign women could not expect to be safe from attack if they walked around in bikinis. He later made a rare apology for his remarks. Back in Panyee the locals hope Thailand's tourist troubles don't put off visitors - and that the floating pitch will continue to draw curious football fans - if they are to provide for future generations. As village chief Muhammad concludes:  'I think we should keep the football pitch for our children and grandchildren because we can say that the floating pitch is unique to the village.'","Island of Panyee offers unusual alternative in the world of football .

"I keep hearing about the win-win relationship between England and the Premiership clubs but, exactly a year out from the World Cup, I am seriously questioning the effectiveness of this partnership from the national team’s perspective. Top-level sport is an unforgiving arena; you normally get just one chance, and there can be no room for compromise. Yet England and the RFU are allowing things to happen that are already damaging our World Cup chances. The clubs, in contrast, fight their fights with an uncompromising resolve and conviction. Firstly, how on earth can England allow Steffon Armitage’s name to appear in Philippe Saint-Andre’s 74-man preliminary World Cup squad, subject to him receiving a French passport? The player named the best in Europe last season is English, has played for England and wants to play for England again. Yet his name is on a French team sheet. It’s baffling. Toulon's Steffon Armitage is English and wants to play for England, but is in a preliminary squad for France . Armitage isn't picked for England due to his playing in France, but new salary cap rules make it illogical that he remain an exile from Stuart Lancaster's team . The World Cup draw dictates there is a decent chance England could meet the French in the semi-finals next year — we’ve played each other in the last three World Cups — and how are we going to feel if Armitage reels off a match-winning performance at Twickenham against us? The Armitage situation is wrong on so many levels. The man in the England No 7 shirt needs to know he is the best and just as importantly his team-mates must be in no doubt. Stuart Lancaster should not tolerate a situation in which, potentially, there is somebody else he could have picked if ‘made available’. And what about the fans shelling out big money? They also have a right to know that England are leaving no stone unturned to select the best squad and then the strongest team. We have a talented pack including outstanding back-rowers, but would we be better for having Armitage available? Certainly. Are we worse off with Armitage playing against us? Emphatically so. So why is this happening? England’s decision not to pick Armitage — or any other player playing outside England — is justified as a way of protecting the club game from an exodus of stars. However, winning a home World Cup would result in the biggest boost imaginable to English rugby, and to have a chance of delivering this we must pick the best players. Compounding all this comes the breaking news that from next season Premiership clubs will be allowed to sign two marquee players who will not be considered part of the £5million salary cap. These players will almost certainly be overseas stars off the back of the World Cup. They will be the best players money can buy. Some would call that self-serving of the clubs but although there are downsides, I disagree. The clubs are simply asserting the initiative and the ‘no compromise’ mentality required and which is the essence of elite sport. Armitage, the 2013-14 European player of the year, during his man of the match performance in the Heineken Cup final against Saracens - he could play against England at the World Cup after applying for a passport . What the announcement this week does is totally expose the RFU’s now untenable position of not picking England players abroad and leaves them wide open to criticism of double standards. There is no logic in England’s Premiership being encouraged and allowed by the RFU to sign these key overseas players — to recognise their value and status in the professional game — while the England management continue to treat English players overseas like outcasts and bans them from representing their country. There is hypocrisy everywhere. Armitage is and has always been fully available for England, he negotiated that with Toulon from the start. What is the moral difference between Steffon Armitage now and England players currently in the Premiership who will join French clubs after the World Cup? Chris Robshaw not captaining Harlequins in a World Cup year is another example of the RFU falling short in this so-called win-win relationship with the clubs. Robshaw needs to be making big decisions and vital calls under pressure every week, he needs to be on top of his game and a big part of that game is the confidence and authority he carries as a captain. Robshaw has combined being the Quins and England captain since 2011 and has done a fine job with both in challenging circumstances. It’s been the making of him as a player. Take one part of that equation away and you could end up with a lesser player as well as a diminished leader. Do that and his position will quickly come under threat because England do not lack for back-row options. This is not the season for Robshaw to take a back seat. Can you imagine Martin Johnson or Lawrence Dallaglio allowing this situation to arise? It might suit Harlequins but it doesn’t suit England. Stuart Lancaster should be throwing tea cups around over this decision. He needs all his leaders to the fore this season, ideally ensuring at least six of his starting team are captaining their clubs week in, week out. In the 2003 World Cup we had 11 past, present and future England captains in the matchday squad for the final. Lancaster: England will be ready for Rugby World Cup . England captain Chris Robshaw is missing valuable chances to make big calls under pressure for Harlequins . England prop Joe Marler (left) has taken over from Robshaw as captain for Quins this season . I applaud the clubs for their hard-line attitude and flexing their muscles to get what they want and need. Their priority is to win the Premiership and European Champions Cup, to put bums on seats, to make a profit, to grow professional rugby in this country. End of story. The clubs will do what it takes, within the laws and regulations. It’s about time the RFU started showing real toughness and matched this attitude head-on. If it was their jobs on the line, these decisions would not be made, and that is why we are getting compromise. The alarm bells started ringing earlier this year when the clubs got their way and wouldn’t rejig their Premiership schedule to allow England to field a first team in the opening Test against New Zealand in Auckland. Again I don’t blame the clubs, but I do blame the RFU for not fighting their corner much harder and this single decision derailed England. We will only know by how much at a later date. The World Cup starts in 365 days and the gloves have to come off. We must get tougher off the field. In a World Cup year, it’s your prerogative; and when that World Cup is at home, it’s your right.","The RFU needs to get tougher with clubs a year out from the World Cup .

"They were the two standout teams of last season’s absorbing Premier League. Manchester City ended up pipping Liverpool to the title, but Brendan Rodgers’ side are intent on exacting revenge. The Reds boss has been handed the staggering revenue generated by Luis Suarez’s sale to Barcelona – and a little bit more - to make sure the Merseysiders top the pile for the first time since 1990. Here, Sportsmail looks at the two probable starting XIs ahead of Monday night's clash at the Etihad Stadium. Goalkeeper: Joe Hart - 8.5 / Simon Mignolet - 7 . It’s been a while since Joe Hart was seen as undroppable, but he is a top-quality goalkeeper and his confidence appears to be back where it should be. With it, some of the decision-based mistakes have gone away. Simon Mignolet is a good all-round keeper. He is comfortable in possession and passing, as Brendan Rodgers expects of his keepers, and a top shot stopper. Faced criticism last season. Stoppers: Simon Mignolet (left) and Joe Hart are both solid goalkeepers for their respective clubs . Right back: Pablo Zabaleta - 8.5 / Glen Johnson - 7 . Zabaleta is one of the best defenders in the Premier League. An excellent tackler, he passes well, reads the game superbly and scores the occasional goal. Johnson is excellent at getting forward, very comfortable in possession. But defensively he is open to serious questioning, which he appears to resent somewhat. Centre half: Vincent Kompany - 9 / Dejan Lovren - 7.5 . Kompany is the best centre-half in the top flight and one of the finest in the world. Lovren had an unhappy time in his last season at Lyon, but was superb for Southampton last season. A fine reader of the game, he can tackle and pass and has the tactical intelligence to play a key role for Rodgers. Running machine: Right back Pablo Zabaleta is one of City's more consistent performers . Struggle: Joe Allen fails to impose himself properly on games in the middle of midfield for Liverpool . Captian Fantastic: Belgian Vincent Kompany is City's leader from the centre of defence . Centre half: Martin Demichelis - 6.5 / Martin Skrtel - 7 . Despite his late-season revival, Demichelis inspires little confidence. He is prone to bad errors, even if he did pick up significantly towards the end of the last campaign. Skrtel is better than he is given credit for, but their back four represented a major weakness of Liverpool’s side from last season. Left back: Aleksandar Kolarov - 7.5 / Alberto Moreno - 7 . Kolarov has emerged as one of the Premier League’s top left backs after a tricky start at City. So much so that the Serbian is keeping Gael Clichy kicking his heels on the bench. For all the £12million signing Moreno’s undoubted quality going forward, the Spain international is an unknown quantity going the other way – particularly against a side who don’t operate with genuine width. Centre midfield: Fernandinho - 8 / Joe Allen - 6.5 . Last season it was all too obvious when Fernandinho wasn’t in the Manchester City midfield. Perhaps that was down to the alternatives available – Javi Garcia to name one – but the Brazilian is a holder who came to the fore in big games for Manuel Pellegrini. Liverpool find themselves in a similar position without Jordan Henderson alongside Steven Gerrard; Allen allows games to pass him by far too easily. Neat and tidy, but not imposing enough. Centre midfield: Steven Gerrard – 9 / Fernando – 7.5 . Yes, we all remember that slip, but Gerrard’s drive and determination carries the Reds through games and he was a major factor in Rodgers almost clinching the title last season. Fernando has begun life in England solidly at Newcastle last week and comes with a huge reputation from Porto. Glider: French midfielder Samir Nasri is one of the first names on Manuel Pellegrini's team sheet . Blink and you'll miss him! Yaya Toure's strong running adds an extra dimension to City's game . Centre midfield: Yaya Toure – 9 / Philippe Coutinho – 8.5 . There is no other man in the Premier League who can turn a game like Yaya Toure. The pace, the power, the sheer brute strength with the ball at his feet, Toure has it all. It was so crucial that City kept hold of him this summer – despite birthday blues – to send out a message that they continue to become stronger. Coutinho, meanwhile, is coming into his own as a Liverpool player – a jinking midfielder able to spot the unspottable and unravel defences. Right wing: Jordan Henderson – 8 / Samir Nasri – 8.5 . A happy Nasri is a dangerous Nasri. That was patently evident in the run-in when the Frenchman swooned around the box to assist Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero. He also popped up with a huge later equaliser against Sunderland and is one of the first men on Pellegrini’s team sheet - a far cry to the problems under Roberto Mancini. Henderson is similar. Written off by the majority as a hugely expensive flop, the 24-year-old has grown into a midfielder capable of excelling at both sides of the game and providing defensive width away from home. Heartbeat: Liverpool are reliant on Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling performing this season . Hotshot: Daniel Sturridge is taking on the mantle of Liverpool's main man after Luis Suarez's departure . Supply and demand: Toure and Edin Dzeko linked up persistently during the charge to the title last year . Left wing: David Silva – 8.5 / Raheem Sterling – 8.5 . A tricky one to judge. Sterling’s blistering pace and direct running make him one of the most exciting wingers in the country, but he remains raw. Silva is a knitter, stitching play together, a sauntering star able to change direction at will and pick the exact moment to play a killer final ball. If there is one criticism of the Spaniard it is that he doesn’t find the net enough. Striker: Edin Dzeko – 8 / Daniel Sturridge – 9 . Luis Suarez’s departure will see Sturridge score even more goals and develop into an even more important player for Rodgers. The striker was a goal machine last year – even with Suarez in tow – and should hit 20 this campaign. Dzeko is perhaps the most underrated player in the top flight. Just the 26 goals in 48 games for him last year – an incredible record for a man lamented by many. Total: Manchester City 7.5 – 3.5 Liverpool (City have seven players with higher ratings than their Red counterpart) PS… there’s Mario still to come! Liverpool have a certain Mario Balotelli on his way from AC Milan, but they arguably needed to do better business strengthening elsewhere instead of splashing out on the enigmatic Italian. On his way in: Mario Balotelli will offer Liverpool something extra when he signs this week .","Yaya Toure and Daniel Sturridge to be key men at the Etihad Stadium .

"Ed Llewellyn, David Cameron’s Chief of Staff, sidles into the room with his gaze fixed to the floor – or, rather, to the hand-woven Bukhara carpet (a personal gift to Tony Blair from the president of Uzbekistan). The place: No 10 Downing Street. The time: 8.30pm. The date: November 20, 2014, the day of the Rochester and Strood by-election. The polls will close in under two hours. ‘I’m afraid it’s bad news, Prime Minister,’ he mutters. ‘I’ve spoken to Stephen [Gilbert, the Conservatives’ by-election head]. We’re going to...’ He pauses for a moment, and avoids the ‘L’ word. ‘We’re not going to be successful.’ Cameron casts his eyes upwards, as if in hope of divine intervention. Finding none, he turns to the next best thing. ‘George,’ he says, grimly. ‘The options again.’ The Chancellor glances up. He is one of three others in the room, together with Lynton Crosby, the Prime Minister’s campaigning chief and general svengali, and Michael Gove, the Chief Whip. Scroll down for video . The by-election will take place in less than a month and the poll shows Ukip, led by Nigel Frage, above, in front . ‘Option one,’ he says. ‘We say we are listening to what the British people have to tell us.’ ‘In other words, business as usual,’ Crosby interjects. ‘Option two,’ Osborne continues. ‘Make the big speech on Europe. Tough action after the next Election. Details to follow.’ ‘Option three,’ Gove cuts in. ‘Act now. Close the borders. Take the wind from Farage’s sails. Put Miliband on the spot. Dare Clegg not to back us. If he won’t, force an Election. Who dares, wins.’ Cameron groans and glances at the office TV. As if to mock his agony, the live feed cuts to an image of horror: a chortling Nigel Farage, pint in hand outside Rochester Cathedral, bopping with Mark Reckless to the Ukip Calypso. Then it cuts back to Westminster for David Davis, Cameron’s old rival. ‘A no-confidence vote in the Prime Minister?’ he says. ‘I couldn’t possibly comment...’ Now, I concede that the Ukip leader is unlikely to be caught grooving to an allegedly racist song, for which he has apologised – let alone with Reckless, a former Conservative MP and Ukip’s by-election candidate (though, Farage being Farage, you never know). But this scenario is more likely to happen than not. The by-election will take place in less than a month. The polls show Ukip in front. The Prime Minister has two options for the next Election, stick to his campaign plan,  which is to fight the contest on the economic recovery, strong leadership and future tax cuts, or put controlling Britain’s borders at the heart of the Election message . That may change, of course. There could be a swing back to the devil – the Conservatives. Reckless may run into trouble. The Tory campaign machine, which is in fine shape, could win through. But the odds are against it. As matters stand, Farage’s party is set to triumph – in which case, welcome to the Conservative Apocalypse. Three main questions would follow the return of a triumphant Reckless to Westminster – and the consequent turmoil in the Tory ranks. Which of those options would Cameron take? Could any hold the party together? Would any be enough to stave off defections to Ukip – and, worst of all, a vote of no-confidence in him? The Prime Minister has a choice for the next Election. The first is to stick to his campaign plan, which is to fight the contest on the economic recovery, strong leadership, future tax cuts and Ed Miliband’s dire personal ratings – all woven together by Crosby under the heading of ‘security’. Tougher immigration control is part of the goods on offer, but it isn’t at the front of the shop window. The second is to put controlling Britain’s borders at the heart of the Election message. Soft and hard versions have been floated, as shown. The soft one would promise action after the Election – an emergency brake on EU migration, perhaps, as a ‘red line’ in the renegotiation that Cameron has pledged as part of a second term. The hard version is that words are no longer enough, and that only action will be taken seriously by the voters. It is difficult to see how closing the borders to EU migrants could be either legal or practicable, or both. The free movement of people is part of the foundation of the EU. To bulldoze it would be tantamount to leaving the EU unilaterally, which is why this option is almost certainly one the Prime Minister won’t take. He has another danger to shut down. Britain recently opted out of the European Arrest Warrant – the controversial arrangement that empowers EU member states to arrest suspects more easily. David Cameron's best chance lies in the weakness of Ed Miliband - and that Conservative MPs, recognising this, will stick with him in the hope that most of them will win next May, and that the Tories will return to Westminster as the largest single party. Having taken Britain out, Theresa May wants to take it back in again. But the Government faces a revolt from up to 100 Conservative MPs. Downing Street is getting restive. Cameron could take up alternatives floated by campaigning Tory backbenchers, such as the independent-minded Dominic Raab, to negotiate an agreement with other EU countries that would keep British courts out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. But he is in an exposed position on these manoeuvres: damned if he acts, damned if he doesn’t. The EU’s new cash grab – its demand for an extra £1.7 billion – has come at the worst possible time. It puts more pressure on Cameron to tear up the campaign grid and go for broke on halting EU migration. That would be strongly welcomed by some Tory MPs, but just as strongly opposed by others. Ken Clarke won support after saying, during a recent meeting of Tory MPs, that the leadership had to get back to fighting the Election on ground that is its own (economic recovery) rather than that which is Farage’s (stopping immigration). The row will go on. This will be so even if no more Tory MPs defect to Ukip, and there is no challenge to Cameron’s leadership. A no-confidence vote is unlikely, even if Farage wins Rochester. Some of the Prime Minister’s Conservative opponents recognise that a challenge could wreck the party altogether. Others want him to take the blame for defeat. Nonetheless, his position among Tory MPs has never been strong. He failed to gain a majority of their votes in the leadership election that he won. He didn’t win the last Election. And he looks most unlikely to pull off the next one. The distribution of the vote is stacked against the Conservatives. Labour has gained former Lib Dem voters. Ukip is disproportionately winning former Tory ones. Cameron’s best chance lies in the dire weakness of Miliband – and that Conservative MPs, recognising this, will stick with him in the hope that most of them will win next May, and that the Tories will return to Westminster as the largest single party. It is still likely that they will. But not for nothing have Tory MPs been called ‘the most sophisticated electorate in the world’. Or, in other words, the most unpredictable – and hard to read. After Rochester, the apocalypse may yet come knocking on Cameron’s door.","David Cameron's best chance lies in the weakness of Ed Miliband .

"Had David Moyes been manager of any other major club in Europe, there is every chance he would be out of his job now. The powerhouses, from Chelsea to Real Madrid to Bayern Munich, do not suffer the kind of season Manchester United have endured without taking ruthless action, and defeat like the one against Olympiacos would have been the end for Moyes anywhere else. Chelsea, remember, sacked Andre Villas-Boas after a dreadful 3-1 defeat against Napoli at the same stage of the Champions League two years ago. VIDEO Scroll down to see Moyes react to Olympiacos defeat and Capital One Cup previews . Troubled times: David Moyes remains in position at Manchester United despite his side's bad run of form . Gone: Chelsea showed no mercy to Andre Villas-Boas when they sacked him after a run of bad form . United, however, are different. Like Liverpool and Arsenal, they do things in what I believe to be the right way. History shows they do not panic or make kneejerk reactions: even Tommy Docherty was not sacked when United were relegated to the old second division in 1974. But just because United have not panicked doesn’t mean they won’t be anxious and nobody knows what the Glazer family are thinking. Moyes deserves until Christmas to show he can be a success but, as a wise football man, he will be aware losing makes positions become untenable. Watching United labour against Olympiacos brought back memories of the situation Roy Hodgson experienced in his brief stay at Liverpool in 2010; the shock home defeats, the unexpected cup exits and certain players letting the manager down badly. The way Robin van Persie, for instance, is playing reminds me of the way Fernando Torres was with Hodgson. His goal record might be good, as was Torres’ for Hodgson, but the quotes that he has made and the stories surrounding him make it feel like Van Persie isn’t behind Moyes. He didn’t miss a game last season in the Barclays Premier League but this year he has been in and out – is he thinking about the World Cup? – while his demeanour has served only to increase the perception there are problems. Torres did exactly the same. If a manager loses his players, there is often no way back and an issue Moyes has to contend with at the moment is the fact he is the focus of the criticism; United’s players will know this and can hide behind that, rather than looking at their own shortcomings. Again, that happened with Hodgson. To see Moyes now, he looks shell-shocked. The Moyes I knew at Everton would never have been so amenable in television interviews after seeing his side perform as badly as United did in Greece. When he was at Everton, you would see the anger in his face and his answers would be short. You knew he felt let down by his team but, equally, you knew he would drag a response out of his team. Setback: Everton were comprehensively beaten by Wigan in the FA Cup last year under Moyes . Response: But Everton stunned Manchester City just seven days later in the Premier League . Last season, after losing to Wigan in the FA Cup, Everton beat Manchester City 2-0 seven days later. That ability to galvanise was one of Moyes’ great strengths. A year earlier, after Liverpool had beaten them in the FA Cup semi-final, Everton responded the following week with a 4-4 draw at Old Trafford, having looked dead and buried. He wouldn’t accept his team just falling away. Before the game in Greece he spoke about United being compact but the team he picked had two wingers and two strikers – if a manager plays that system and gets a result, he is regarded as brave. If it backfires, he is naive. It is almost as if he’s caught between the Manchester United way and his own mentality. He is not a front-foot manager – that is not a criticism, as neither is Jose Mourinho – but there doesn’t look to be any fizz or fight about United. They don’t look to be one thing or the other. I’d go as far as to say this is the slowest United side I have seen and in Piraeus they looked like a team of old men coming to the end. Facing United used to be unnerving, as you never knew how they would play. Look familiar? United's performance in Europe in midweek was like watching Liverpool under Roy Hodgson . Beaten again: United face a fight to stay in the Champions League after losing 2-0 to Olympiacos last week . Blow: Joel Campbell peels away to celebrate after scoring Olympiacos' second goal against United . If they wanted to pass you to sleep, they would do it without a problem. But if they wanted to pick you off on the break, they had the speed and cutting edge to shred you to pieces. The two signings of Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini won’t change that, as they don’t have pace. Moyes, it must be said, is also having no luck – the deliberate deflection that aided Olympiacos's first goal epitomised how things are going – and he has said that often in press conferences - but is he just genuinely unlucky or is he a manager who comes up short? He did a magnificent job at Preston and took them to the brink of the Premier League before losing the play-off final against Bolton in 2001; the work he did in reviving Everton was beyond question but in those legacy-defining games – Villarreal (2005), Chelsea (2009), Liverpool (2012) – it was just one hurdle too many. It is not unusual, of course, for managers to have poor first seasons at big clubs before turning things round. Gerard Houllier, Rafa Benitez (Istanbul apart!) and Brendan Rodgers all found life difficult at Anfield but there was no sense they were ever in trouble. They were given the confidence and belief to build their projects and that is what United are doing with Moyes. Deep down, though, he and his board will know they can’t keep on losing. He needs an attention-grabbing victory, the kind United used to achieve regularly, to settle the nerves. On the same page? Robin van Persie criticised his team-mates after their defeat in Greece . Nothing beats winning a cup final . During Norwich’s game with Tottenham last Sunday, an award was made on the pitch to Ken Brown. As he’d just celebrated his 80th birthday, he’d been invited back for the day and was given a thunderous ovation. Brown is held in great affection at Carrow Road because he was the manager who led Norwich to victory in the League Cup in 1985. Norwich were also relegated that season but that did not change Brown’s place in the affections of their supporters. Stuff dreams are made of: Norwich's Mick Channon and manager Ken Brown celebrate at Wembley in 1985 . Would Brown have been invited back had Norwich’s campaign in 1984-85 simply ended with them staying up and not winning a trophy? Football is all about the moments Norwich experienced 29 years ago and tomorrow Gus Poyet has a chance to achieve something similar with Sunderland, the club who were on the receiving end of Brown’s greatest day. They go into the Capital One Cup final in the bottom three but Poyet’s squad can put themselves alongside Jim Montgomery and Ian Porterfield, the heroes of the 1973 FA Cup-winning team, if they pull off the shock of the season and beat Manchester City. I understand that huge financial . rewards nowadays have changed how the game is perceived but the glorious . moments, like Brown’s boys of 1985 and Ben Watson and Wigan last May in . the FA Cup, must continue to be what we love about football. The . game is about winning things; that’s what you dream of when you are a . kid, of running around Wembley with a cup. I played in the Premier . League and in Europe all my career but nothing can beat the feeling of . parading a trophy with your supporters at the end of a final. If Sunderland are relegated in May but beat Manchester City on Sunday, I know which memory will last longer 30 years from now. Time to shine: Sunderland reached the Capital One Cup final by beating Manchester United on penalties . My top five... things to keep me busy . I thought when I stopped playing that I would have more time on my hands but, if anything, I’ve been even busier than before. 1 Going to Twickenham – I’ve taken an interest in rugby union since I was bowled over by the intensity of the Lions tour last summer and last week I got to sample my first live game. It was a great experience seeing England beat Ireland 13-10 at Twickenham and the atmosphere was fantastic. I will certainly be going back in the future. Big win: England celebrate after seeing off Ireland at Twickenham in the Six Nations . 2 Pulling on my boots... again – I thought my appearance in Steven Gerrard’s testimonial last August would be my final game but I’m appearing in the ‘Match against Poverty’ in Switzerland this Wednesday. Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luis Figo and Robert Pires head an all-star cast and I’m looking forward to the game. 3 Reading about Iron Mike – Mike Tyson is one of the most fascinating sportsmen of the modern generation and, as was the case when he was in the ring, there are no punches pulled in his autobiography The Undisputed Truth. I like reading sports books and this is one of the best I’ve read in a while. Pulling no punches: Mike Tyson was the youngest ever heavyweight champion of the world . Read all about it: Tyson has written an explosive autobiography about his life in and outside of the ring . 4 Reminiscing in Dublin – I made a flying visit to Ireland with Didi Hamann on Thursday for a night in the Olympia Theatre, talking about our careers at Liverpool and, of course, that night in Istanbul. As you would expect, there was a lively crowd and a good night was had by all. 5 Keeping an eye on England – International friendlies might not be to everyone’s interest but I will be watching the game against Denmark closely when I get home next week from Switzerland. Roy Hodgson will experiment but he will also want to get a clear picture of who will start in Manaus against Italy when the World Cup campaign begins.","At Chelsea or Real Madrid, David Moyes would have been fired by now .

"CLICK HERE to catch up on all the stats from the big game, including the patient build up to Raheem Sterling's strike . They played with pace, subtlety and panache. At times they threatened to overwhelm the opposition. And some of their football was a delight to behold. But, no, it was not the team of Raheem Sterling, Mario Balotelli and Steven Gerrard that so pleased the eye at Upton Park. Rather it was Sam Allardyce’s West Ham. At times they looked scintillating. Granted, the opening ten minutes of the game was the period in which they were most devastating. And they had to endure a more uncomfortable second half when Liverpool, after a change of formation, finally hit their stride. But when, on 88 minutes, Stewart Downing found Morgan Amalfitano and the Frenchman, on his home debut, simply prodded the ball past Simon Mignolet to seal the victory it felt like a fitting finale.

Alex Song had just been named man of the match and it was as though every signing made this summer was playing his part. In Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate, Allardyce has assembled a front-three with enough speed and craft to thrill home supporters, who for so long have shown discontent with the attacking verve of their team. In playing Downing behind those three, Allardyce has added guile to his line-up and rejuvenated the man best known for his ability on wing. The manager has remodelled West Ham. They are, as Liverpool discovered, an entirely different proposition to last season. The Hammers, without a home win this season and cast as the perennial ugly sisters at the Premier League Ball, started with such verve and incision that it seemed even to surprise themselves. Certainly Allardyce will have been purring. Asked to employ an attacking coach and with a chairman, in David Sullivan, who used his programme column to remark favourably on how many more passes the team are now making, the manager bears the inferences with seemingly good grace. So to see his side tearing apart the darlings of last season in those opening exchanges must have been particularly satisfying. Downing was at the heart of most of it, playing centrally, just behind Sakho and causing Liverpool a host of problems. The first came after just two minutes, Downing’s delightful inswinging free-kick inducing panic in the Liverpool back four. Goalkeeper Simon Mignolet failed to come and no defender dealt with it so James Tomkins headed it back across goal for Winston Reid to nod over the line. Upton Park erupted but the excitement had yet to reach its peak. Just five minutes later, the home side worked the ball crisply to Sakho on the right. The Senegal forward sprinted away, took a touch and then simply dinked the most delightful of chips over Mignolet. Now the stadium truly roared.

The Belgian keeper looked exposed on both goals but recovered enough to push away Aaron Cresswell’s shot on 13 minutes while Adrian incurred the wrath of Mark Noble when he kicked out at Mario Balotelli after the Italian had made a late challenge on the goalkeeper. Both Balotelli and Adrian were cautioned, the Spaniard fortunate not to have been handed a more severe punishment by referee Craig Pawson. Liverpool looked increasingly shambolic and manager Brendan Rodgers intervened, making a 25th-minute switch to a back three by taking off right-back Javier Manquillo for centre half Mamadou Sakho. It sparked a reaction as Liverpool had a brief period in which they established some midfield control and within that they scored. Balotelli somehow brought down a cross that seemed beyond him and, though the Italian forward’s shot was deflected away, Sterling followed up to hit a superb strike past Adrian with Valencia failing to track his man. Yet it was a brief respite for Liverpool and West Ham continued to threaten. Valencia had two further chances to restore a two-goal advantage and Mignolet needed to be alert to parry away the danger. As it was, Liverpool would have been relieved to regroup at half time just the one goal down.

Rodgers brought on a summer signing of his own in Adam Lallana at half time to play behind the front two for another change of shape, this time more subtle. And amid the steady east London drizzle Liverpool finally began to demonstrate some genuine attacking creativity. Sterling was starting to find space in which to run at defenders and Balotelli at last got a chance to show some of his undoubted quality: a curling, crossfield ball on 53 minutes, nicely weighted to run into the path of Fabio Borini, was one such moment. Borini opted for a shot, which Adrian saved comfortably, when he might have pulled the ball back for oncoming team-mates. Then, in the 59th minute Balotelli curled a shot at Adrian which the Spaniard saved. Borini’s strike on 64 minutes caught a deflection and almost wrong-footed Adrian, the goalkeeper scrambling to recover as he failed to take the ball. He did so, but with his foot up, managed to take out a late arriving Borini as well. West Ham, with Valencia, Sakho and Kouyate offering genuine pace and attacking intent, remained a considerable threat, Sakho shooting just over on 69 minutes. But Liverpool’s back three were much more alive to the threat than previously as the midfield in front of them slowly established some dominance. West Ham’s attacking threat never disappeared, however, and it was fitting that the home side ended the match as they started it by putting the ball into stunned Liverpool’s net.

"The U.S. told Iran of its plans to strike ISIS militants inside Syria in order to reassure them that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would not be targetted, a senior Iranian official has claimed. The communication, confirmed in part by a senior U.S. State Department official, appears to signal a cooling in hostilities between the U.S. and Iran for the first time since a 1979 hostage crisis prompted Washington to sever ties with Tehran. Iran is said to have voiced concerns for the safety of Assad, who remains the Shia Islam-dominated nation's closest regional ally and the recipient of Iranian military support during a Syrian Civil War. Scroll down for video . Talks: Representatives for Barack Obama (right) told Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (left) in advance of plans to strike ISIS militants inside Syria in order to ease concerns that  Bashar al-Assad may be targetted . Rubble: Locals inspect buildings destroyed by US-led coalition airstrikes in the town of Kfar Derian in Aleppo province. Iran was reportedly given advance warning of the strikes against jihadist targets in Syria . Firepower: The guided-missile destroyer USS Arleigh Burke launches Tomahawk cruise missiles in the Red Sea against ISIS bases in Syria yesterday . 'Iran was concerned about Assad's position and his government being weakened in case of any action against IS (Islamic State) in Syria and brought this issue up in meetings with Americans,' the senior Iranian official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'This issue was first discussed in Geneva and then was discussed thoroughly in New York where Iran was assured that Assad and his government will not be targeted in case of any military action against Daesh [ISIS] in Syria,' he added. The Iranian official said Iran was informed separately in advance of the airstrikes launched by Washington and Arab allies against Islamic State positions in Syria for the first time. Asked about the assurance that Syrian government forces would not be targeted, the senior U.S. State Department official told Reuters: . 'We communicated our intentions, but not specific timing or targets, to the Iranians. As we've said, we won't be coordinating military action with Iran. And of course we won't be sharing intelligence with Iran either.' The public communication has included some mixed signals. Unharmed: Iran is said to have voiced concerns for the safety of its ally Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, pictured here meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in Damascus yesterday, hours after the airstrikes .

Under attack: This image, released by the U.S. military, shows before and after images of ISIS' finance center in the Syrian city of Raqqa, following a direct hit from a Tommahawk missile . Both Iran and the United States acknowledge having an interest in defeating ISIS. Tehran has called on the world to fight the militants, who stand accused of a wave of violence, beheadings and massacres of civilians while taking over swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq. Speaking to senior editors in New York, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani stopped short of endorsing or condemning the airstrikes by the United States and Arab allies, though he raised questions about its legality. He described this week as an important one for his country's talks with world powers, including the United States, which are meant to forge a long-term accord by November 24 that would end sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has ruled out cooperating with the United States to tackle the hardline Sunni militant group. But other Iranian officials said that Tehran would be ready to work with Western powers to stop the militants in return for concessions in the nuclear talks on Tehran's uranium enrichment program. Blast: This still image and the one below were taken from video released by the U.S. Central Command yesterday, showing a structure in Tall Al Qitar, Syria moments after a U.S. airstrike . On Monday the White House said it would refuse to connect nuclear talks, under way on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York this week, with the fight against the militant group. Iranian officials told Reuters privately that Iran already was cooperating with Washington in the fight against the jihadist rebels. 'This is an intelligence matter and I can assure you geopolitical and intelligence matters will not be shared with Americans ... but military and security issues are being shared to fight against IS (ISIS),' a senior Iran security official said. Tehran's leadership has approved the 'idea of cooperation with the Americans,' he said, because it serves Iran's interests. Iran has occasionally shared classified information with Washington, including during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and the conflict in Iraq.","U.S informed Iran of airstrikes to ease fears over Syrian President's safety .

"U.S. airstrikes against the little known Khorasan terror group have failed to stop 'imminent' attacks on Western targets because key members scattered amid news reports of their existence. Many of the Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists are believed to have fled their bases near the Syrian city of Aleppo several days before the strikes, taking with them the dangerous explosives with which they are said to be plotting to blow up planes over Europe and the United States. As a result, the bombing raid managed to kill 'only one or two' key figures, with the remaining 1,000 Khorasan members continuing plans to attack the West, according to U.S. intelligence officials. The existence of the Khorasan group only emerged in the weeks before the September 22 U.S. air force bombing raid, which took place on the same night as a coalition of American and Arab warplanes carried out their first strikes on Islamic State targets inside Syria. Scroll down for video . Target: The airstrikes on September 22 targeted Khorasan's facilities - such as training camps and explosivies and communications facilities - but failed to kill more than 'one or two' key figures . Destroyed: However officials say many suspected leaders and members of the Khorasan Group managed to escape the bombings - and take high-tech explosive devices with them . On September 22, the U.S. fired 46 cruise missiles at eight locations linked to the Khorasan group, although their limited effectiveness has now been fully revealed. Among the Khorasan fighters who survived the airstrikes is a French-born jihadist who fought in Afghanistan and has a military prowess that is of great concern to U.S. intelligence officials. One of the U.S. missiles went awry and killed a dozen civilians in the village of Kfar Derian, according to Mohammed Abu Omar, an activist in the northern province of Idlib. The U.S. military says it has not confirmed any civilian casualties. The failure of the attack on Khorasan is partly the result of a hazy intelligence picture that also has bedeviled the air campaign against Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq. The U.S. lacks the networks of bases, spies and ground-based technology it had in place during the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, officials say, or even the network of human sources it developed in Pakistan and Yemen. 'The strikes were certainly effective in setting back the Khorasan Group, but no one thinks they were a permanent solution or a death blow to the threats that come from this cell,' said Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee. Bombed: The targets of the strikes were fighters from the Khorasan Group, which is how the U.S. government refers to a cell led by Al Qaeda veterans who had relocated to Syria from Afghanistan-Pakistan . Failed:T he existence of the Khorasan group only emerged in the weeks before the September 22 U.S. air force bombing raid, which took place on the same night as a coalition of American and Arab warplanes carried out their first strikes on Islamic State targets inside Syria. Damage: One of the U.S. missiles went awry and killed a dozen civilians in the village of Kfar Derian (pictured), according to Mohammed Abu Omar, an activist in the north Syrian province of Idlib . The existence of Khorasan became public only weeks before the airstrikes, prompting a flurry of news reports, but U.S. officials claim to have been tracking the militants for up to two years. Officials said that among the group's top brass are a few dozen Al Qaeda members, some of whom are long-sought militants connected to the fighting in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the last decade. Khorasan is said to be working closely with Nusra Front - a terror group that has acted as Al Qaeda official presence in Syria during the ongoing civil war that has ravaged the country of the past three years. The details were provided by several current and former U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity about the group because they were not authorized to discuss classified information. In public, U.S. officials have offered seemingly contradictory assessments of the attacks on the Khorasan group. General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the strikes disrupted the group's plotting, but he did not know for how long. FBI Director James Comey said he believed the plots had not been disrupted and that the group remains a threat to the U.S. Other intelligence officials embraced Comey's view. Launch: On September 22, the U.S. fired 46 cruise missiles at eight locations linked to the Khorsan group, although their limited effectiveness has now been fully revealed . One Khorasan leader, Muhsin al-Fadhli (pictured), has been eulogized as a 'martyr' on jihadi websites. But American officials are not convinced he is dead and fear the claims are a front to turn attention away from him . Terrorist group ISIS may be considering using Ebola as a suicide bio-weapon against the West, according to a military expert. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with an infected person who is showing the symptoms – and it wouldn't be difficult for fanatics to contract it then travel to countries they want to wreak havoc in, according to a military expert. Captain Al Shimkus a Professor of National Security Affairs at the U.S. Naval War College, said that the strategy is entirely plausible. He told Forbes: 'The individual exposed to the Ebola Virus would be the carrier. In the context of terrorist activity, it doesn't take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.' And Professor Anthony Glees, Director at Buckingham University's Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies, agrees that the strategy might be considered. He said: 'In some ways it's a plausible theory – IS fighters believe in suicide and this is a potential job for a suicide mission.' 'They are sufficiently murderous and well-informed to consider it, and they know that we've been remiss in the UK,' he added. Khorasan is a historical reference to a region that included parts of Iran and Afghanistan. Unlike the Nusra Front, which is trying to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad, the Khorasan Group is focused chiefly on carrying out an attack against the West, officials say. The group is said to have been trying to recruit Europeans and Americans whose passports allow them to board a U.S.-bound airliner with less scrutiny. In addition, according to classified U.S. intelligence assessments, the Khorasan militants have been trying to make or obtain explosives that can be slipped past airport security. Among their sources, officials said, has been Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, which has put bombs on airplanes, though the bombs failed to explode. The fear is that the Khorasan militants will provide these sophisticated explosives to their Western recruits who could sneak them onto U.S.-bound flights. One Khorasan leader, Muhsin al-Fadhli, has been eulogized on jihadi websites, but American officials are not convinced that he is dead. They said they believe another senior militant was killed, but have declined to name him. A second Khorasan figure, a French militant named David Drugeon, is believed to be alive. Drugeon, who was born in the Brittany region and converted to Islam as a youth, spent time with Al Qaeda in the tribal areas of Pakistan before traveling to Syria, French officials say. He was identified as a member of the Khorasan Group by two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss classified information.","Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists fled bases  several days before the airstrikes .

"Ryanair could soon offer all-inclusive trips to holidaymakers as its chief marketing officer has hinted at plans to launch a holiday brand within the next five years. The airline's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs, who is tasked with improving its image, said it would be a ‘logical’ move for the Dublin-based carrier to expand into holidays to capture a larger share of the leisure market. He revealed the plans as Europe’s largest budget airline is in the middle of a charm offensive in a bid to win over passengers.

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary (centre) and chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs (right) hold a press conference with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of Transport Roger Lewentz on 12 May 2014 . Long criticised for its surcharges and customer service, Ryanair has softened its stance on baggage charges and booking conditions and introduced allocated seating and a new business class service. It already offers bookings for hotel rooms, car hires and airport parking or transfers, but Mr Jacobs believes the no-frills carrier can do a better job of offering holiday packages. He told TTG Digital: ‘If it becomes Ryanair Holidays at a point in time it is a logical way for the brand to go. ‘We do a version of it already. We can certainly do it better than we do. The way customers are responding to the new improved Ryanair, I think it will go forward.’ It comes as the airline attempts to shed its unsavoury image and tap into new markets to boost profits.

Ryanair has softened its stance on baggage charges and introduced a new business class service . Mr Jacobs added: ‘People will say you will not have been able to do that with the old Ryanair. ‘We will always be a low-cost airline, but we are a travel business. We are starting to open our eyes to that opportunity.’ Ryanair insists its changes have already paid off with a rise in customers and earnings. The airline has also announced plans to move into more primary airports, and its flights are being sold again by travel agents after a ten-year hiatus.","Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said it would be a 'logical' move .

"The family of a former public schoolboy killed while fighting for Islamic State have blamed the UK government for making it difficult for young fighters like him to return to Britain. Muhammad Mehdi Hassan, 20, was said to be desperate to escape the warzone in Syria but was scared of the repercussions awaiting him if he made it back to his home city of Portsmouth. Last night his devastated family said Hassan, and other fighters like him, would put down their weapons and return to their homes if the threat of being jailed in the UK wasn’t hanging over them. Scroll down for video . Scared: Muhammed Mehdi Hassan, 19, had expressed plans to return to Britain over the last few months but had been scared about the repercussions and the threat of prosecution on terror charges, his family said . The aspiring young student’s parents had travelled to Turkey earlier this year to meet him in the hope of bringing him home. But just minutes away from the border, he was stopped from leaving by fellow militants. His uncle, Muslim Khan, described last night how Hassan’s family discovered that he had died last week fighting in the battle for Kobane after seeing images of his body posted on Twitter. Mr Khan told ITV News that Hassan’s fate could have been different if the young fighter, who spoke about being trapped in Syria, thought the UK government would be willing to help people like him return to Britain. ‘If the British Government helped them to come back, I think all of them would come back. I believe that,’ Mr Khan said. 'Lovely': Hassan's family said that his fate would have been different if the Government had made it easier to return home after fighting in Syria . ‘They want to come back but they are scared. They [the Government] have said if they come [back] they’ll go to prison.’ He appealed to the parents of a group of more than 30 disenchanted British jihadis who want to escape the fighting not to give up in the hope that the Government could change its policy. Many are unable to leave the warzone amid threats from senior Islamic State figures that they could be beheaded for disloyalty, and if they do escape they face being jailed in the UK. Mr Khan said: ‘My message to the parents, don’t give up, we will try and maybe the Government will change their policy and they will come back here. Like Mehdi, he was nearly coming and he could not come. It’s bad luck. Don’t give up. Try.’ Hassan’s mother said she feared her son had been radicalised via friends and the internet while spending hours on his laptop after seeing images of the brutality against democracy protesters in Syria. In an emotional interview with ITV News she said: ‘I had no idea he was thinking of that [jihad]. It was out of his character he would abandon his family and leave like that. He was loving, gentle and a kind boy. People who met him would remember him for manners and etiquette.’ Hassan, who used the ‘battle name’ Abu Dujana, was among a group of friends who called themselves the Britani Brigade Bangladeshi Bad Boys who travelled to Syria from Portsmouth. He was the fourth of the group to be killed. His mother described them as normal young people with good educations. She said: ‘Their parents are [as] shocked as I am. Most loved sons – they have beautiful prosperous future ahead of them. Fanatics: Hassan's uncle said that his nephew and his friends, pictured in Gatwick airport on their way to Turkey, would have all come back home but that they were afraid of going to prison . ‘Their hearts melted when they saw what’s happening in Syria. They are impressionable boys and they are so naive they didn’t think in balanced way about implication on life.’ She added tearfully: ‘I am trying to carry on for the rest of my children. I miss Muhammad so much. It’s just like a nightmare, this time last year in October we had lots of fun... he was just fine and with us all the time.’ The death of Hassan means four of the six self-styled Portsmouth jihadis are now dead, with another serving a prison sentence in Britain for terrorist offences and one believed to be in hospital. Hassan attended St John's College, a Catholic school in Portsmouth, which charges £10,000 a year for pupils . Hassan’s friend Mamunur Mohammed Roshid, 24 – nicknamed Sleepyhead – is thought to have been killed a few days before him last week. Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, a former Primark worker also from Portsmouth, was killed in July by troops loyal to the Assad regime. A fourth Portsmouth man, Ifthekar Jaman, 23, died in Syria in December last year while taking part in an IS assault on a major arms depot. He had previously worked in customer services for Sky. The fifth Portsmouth jihadi, Mashudur Rahman Choudhury, 31, was jailed on terrorism charges in May after returning to Britain from Syria in October last year. A teacher who planned to wage jihad alongside Islamic State was only stopped from flying to Syria when his family confiscated his passport. Jamshed Javeed, 30, is now facing jail after admitting two counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts at Woolwich Crown Court in south London yesterday. British-born Javeed, who taught science at Sharples School in Bolton, decided to join the fighting after becoming ‘deeply moved’ by reports of the suffering of Syrians. However he insisted that he was not an extremist and even intended to resume his teaching career following his return from Syria. His lawyers said he did not support the aims of Islamic State or the execution of hostages. The father of two, of Levenshulme, Manchester, made plans to leave last November but relatives – including his father – hid his passport. He applied for another one but was arrested last December as he tried to travel to Syria. He has been remanded in custody for sentencing. Detectives are confident that he did not radicalise any pupils at his school, and say his arrest came as a ‘complete shock’ to fellow staff.","Mehdi Hassan, 19, who used alias Abu Dujana, killed fighting for ISIS in Syria .

"The earth's magnetic field could flip in just 100 years, researchers have found. The move, which would mean all compasses pointed south instead of north, was thought to take thousands of years. However, a new study found it can happen far faster. The magnetic field and electric currents in and around Earth generate complex forces that have immeasurable impact on every day life. The field can be thought of as a huge bubble, protecting us from cosmic radiation and charged particles that bombard Earth in solar winds. now, researchers say it could switch within 100 years. Such a reversal could potentially wreak havoc with our electrical grid, generating currents that might take it down. Earth's magnetic field protects life from energetic particles from the sun and cosmic rays, both of which can cause genetic mutations, a weakening or temporary loss of the field before a permanent reversal could increase cancer rates. The danger to life would be even greater if flips were preceded by long periods of unstable magnetic behavior, say the researchers. Earth's magnetic field has flipped many times throughout the planet's history. Its dipole magnetic field, like that of a bar magnet, remains about the same intensity for thousands to millions of years. Then, for unknown reasons, it  weakens and, reverses direction. Thenew study by a team of scientists from Italy, France, Columbia University and the University of California, Berkeley, demonstrates that the last magnetic reversal 786,000 years ago actually happened very quickly, in less than 100 years – roughly a human lifetime. 'It's amazing how rapidly we see that reversal,' said UC Berkeley graduate student Courtney Sprain. 'The paleomagnetic data are very well done. This is one of the best records we have so far of what happens during a reversal and how quickly these reversals can happen.' Sprain and Paul Renne, director of the Berkeley Geochronology Center and a UC Berkeley professor-in- residence of earth and planetary science, are coauthors of the study, . The discovery comes as new evidence indicates that the intensity of Earth's magnetic field is decreasing 10 times faster than normal, leading some geophysicists to predict a reversal within a few thousand years. Though a magnetic reversal is a major planet-wide event driven by convection in Earth's iron core, there are no documented catastrophes associated with past reversals, despite much searching in the geologic and biologic record. Today, however, such a reversal could potentially wreak havoc with our electrical grid, generating currents that might take it down. Left to right, Biaggio Giaccio, Gianluca Sotilli, Courtney Sprain and Sebastien Nomade sitting next to an outcrop in the Sulmona basin of the Apennine Mountains that contains the Matuyama-Brunhes magnetic reversal. A layer of volcanic ash interbedded with the lake sediments can be seen above their heads. Sotilli and Sprain are pointing to the sediment layer in which the magnetic reversal occurred. The new finding is based on measurements of the magnetic field alignment in layers of ancient lake sediments now exposed in the Sulmona basin of the Apennine Mountains east of Rome, Italy. The lake sediments are interbedded with ash layers erupted from the Roman volcanic province, a large area of volcanoes upwind of the former lake that includes periodically erupting volcanoes near Sabatini, Vesuvius and the Alban Hills. Italian researchers led by Leonardo Sagnotti of Rome's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology measured the magnetic field directions frozen into the sediments as they accumulated at the bottom of the ancient lake. Sprain and Renne used argon-argon dating, a method widely used to determine the ages of rocks, whether they're thousands or billions of years old, to determine the age of ash layers above and below the sediment layer recording the last reversal. These dates were confirmed by their colleague and former UC Berkeley postdoctoral fellow Sebastien Nomade of the Laboratory of Environmental and Climate Sciences in Gif-Sur-Yvette, France. Because the lake sediments were deposited at a high and steady rate over a 10,000-year period, the team was able to interpolate the date of the layer showing the magnetic reversal, called the Matuyama-Brunhes transition, at approximately 786,000 years ago. This date is far more precise than that from previous studies, which placed the reversal between 770,000 and 795,000 years ago. And since Earth's magnetic field protects life from energetic particles from the sun and cosmic rays, both of which can cause genetic mutations, a weakening or temporary loss of the field before a permanent reversal could increase cancer rates. The danger to life would be even greater if flips were preceded by long periods of unstable magnetic behavior. 'We should be thinking more about what the biologic effects would be,' Renne said. 'What's incredible is that you go from reverse polarity to a field that is normal with essentially nothing in between, which means it had to have happened very quickly, probably in less than 100 years,' said Renne. 'We don't know whether the next reversal will occur as suddenly as this one did, but we also don't know that it won't.' The 'north pole' - that is, the direction of magnetic north - was reversed a million years ago. This map shows how, starting about 789,000 years ago, the north pole wandered around Antarctica for several thousand years before flipping 786,000 years ago to the orientation we know today, with the pole somewhere in the Arctic. Whether or not the new finding spells trouble for modern civilization, it likely will help researchers understand how and why Earth's magnetic field episodically reverses polarity, Renne said. The research will be published in the November issue of Geophysical Journal International. The magnetic record the Italian-led team obtained shows that the sudden 180-degree flip of the field was preceded by a period of instability that spanned more than 6,000 years. The instability included two intervals of low magnetic field strength that lasted about 2,000 years each. Rapid changes in field orientations may have occurred within the first interval of low strength. The full magnetic polarity reversal – that is, the final and very rapid flip to what the field is today – happened toward the end of the most recent interval of low field strength.","New study finds it can take just 100 years to flip .

"Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond today compared Iraq's war-ravaged Kurdish breakaway region fighting ISIS – to Scotland. Mr Hammond, speaking in Baghdad after meeting the country's new Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, said he hoped Scotland's decision to reject independence would inspire Iraq to stay united. Speaking at a joint press conference with Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari, Mr Hammond said: 'I hope that the experience of Scotland will be a useful model for Iraq.' Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and his Iraqi counterpart Ibrahim al-Jaafari spoke to reporters  in Baghdad today. Mr Hammond urged Kurdish separatists not to leave Iraq . His remarks come after Mr Hammond wrongly claimed that Britain was not considering airstrikes on Syria – a claim swiftly rejected by Downing Street. Mr Hammond was later forced to apologise and clarify his remarks. Iraq's autonomous region of Kurdistan has vowed to hold a referendum on independence . Kurdish independence has soared in popularity with the Iraqi state on the brink of collapse following the dramatic gains by ISIS fanatics since June, . The breakaway region is being armed by Britain and other Western powers to hold back the fanatics' sweeping advance in northern Iraq. But Mr Hammond said the Kurds should stay in Iraq – suggesting that, like Scotland, they are 'stronger' in a united Iraq. Scotland voted to reject independence last month by 55 to 45 per cent, despite a last-minute panic following polls which showed the race tipping in favour of the nationalists. Speaking in Baghdad today, Mr Hammond said: 'The Scottish people looked long and hard at the question of separation and they decided they were better off in the United Kingdom, stronger and safer in the United Kingdom.' Mr Hammond also met Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, who took office last month at the head of a new administration intended to be more inclusive of the country's ethnic and religious groups. Amid growing concern that Iraqi forces are unable to turn the tide on jihadist expansion despite foreign air strikes, Mr Hammond reiterated Britain's support, but ruled out a ground intervention. 'To beat ISIL, it is the Iraqi people, the Iraqi security forces and the Iraqi government that will have to take the lead on the ground,' he said. Mr Hammond said allied air strikes against Islamic State militants had halted the jihadists' advance in Iraq and degraded their military capabilities. In a show of support for Mr Abadi's government, Mr Hammond said the UK was determined to 'play its part' in helping Iraqis combat the IS fighters - also referred to as Isis or Isil (Islamic State in Iraq and Levant). Addressing reporters following the talks, the Foreign Secretary said: 'We've always understood that the air campaign alone was not going to be decisive in turning the tide against Isil. 'But it has halted the Isil advance, it has forced Isil to change its tactics and it is degrading their military capabilities.'

Black smoke, rising after US-led coalition's air forces airstrikes against ISIS members in Ayn al-Arab of northern Syria, is seen from across the border in Turkey . Despite the airstrikes ISIS fanatics are continuing their advance using tanks to take over Dabik village, in Aleppo, Syria . Confirming the UK Government's position that there will be no British 'boots on the ground' in Iraq, Mr Hammond added: 'The heavy work on the ground is going to have to be done by Iraqi forces.' His visit came amid fears that the key Sunni province of Anbar in western Iraq could be about to fall to IS. The province's police chief was killed on Sunday when his convoy was hit by a roadside bomb close to the capital, Ramadi. Following last month's emergency Commons vote, RAF Tornado GR4 fighter bombers have been attacking IS targets in Iraq in support of the US-led coalition being assembled to counter the jihadi threat. It was disclosed over the weekend that a small team of Army instructors from the 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment is in the Kurdish capital, Irbil, helping to train the Kurdish peshmerga fighters to use heavy machine guns which the UK has supplied to them.","Philip Hammond was in Baghdad today to meet the new PM Haidar al-Abadi .

"A couple whose £1,000 holiday was ruined by the noise of building works claim they have been offered just £30 in travel vouchers in compensation. Jordan Pedelty and Dee Kimmings, from Slaithwaite, West Yorkshire, say they were woken at 7am every morning by drilling and banging at the Columbus Aparthotel, Playa de las Americas, Tenerife. When booking the week-long holiday with Thomson, the couple say they were not warned about any building works taking place at the resort during their break. Scroll down for video . Jordan Pedelty and Dee Kimmings feel they have not been compensated for their holiday nightmare . Mr Pedelty snapped the builders in action at the Columbus Aparthotel, Playa de las Americas . Having being disturbed by the noise on the first day, they requested to move rooms, only to be told this was not possible as all other rooms were fully booked. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Jordan, who works for Yorkshire Water, said: 'There was banging and drilling, it was just a nightmare.  If you've had a night out you don't want to be woken at 7am. 'We couldn't even go to the pool because it was too noisy. Mr Pedelty's anger only grew when he found other holidaymakers had received a discount due to the work . Other guests at the Columbus Aparthotel were warned in advance of the building works . 'What made it worse was when we were chatting to other holidaymakers, they all said they were told about the building work and had got a reduced price because of it. 'That just made us feel even worse.' After contacting Thomson to complain about the noise that disrupted their stay, Mr Pedelty claims they were originally offered £30 in holiday vouchers. A gesture from the Thomson shop in the Kingsgate Centre in Huddersfield topped this up to £130 in total. Around 30-40 rooms at the Columbus Aparthotel were being worked on, according to Mr Pedelty . Builders were snapped by Mr Pedelty as he tried to relax by the pool with his partner . The couple, however, have said they are seeking a full refund for their holiday. Mr Pedelty estimates that 30-40 rooms were being renovated during their trip - and he took photographs of the work being carried out and also took footage which captures the noise. 'I'm still not happy with what has been offered,'  Mr Pedelty said. 'It was an absolute nightmare from the start; from the first day my partner just wanted to go home. 'We definitely think we are entitled to a full refund, or a nice gesture would be for Thomson to take me, my partner and her child away to compensate.' Jordan  and Dee claim they were not warned of building work going on at Columbus Aparthotel . A spokesperson for Thomson told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomson is sorry to hear that Mr Pedelty was unhappy with his holiday accommodation in Tenerife. 'Unfortunately, due to a system error, notification of the building work was not sent to Mr Pedelty prior to departure. 'However, every effort was made to position him in a room as far away from any disruption as possible. We are in contact with Mr Pedelty directly to resolve his complaint. 'We would like to reassure customers that this hotel remains a popular choice with guests.'","Jordan Pedelty and Dee Kimmings booked Tenerife holiday with Thomson .

The variant - influenza A (H3N2) - has been linked to higher rates of hospitalization and death, especially in the elderly.

The CDC issued an advisory to doctors about the situation on Wednesday. It noted that flu virus samples the agency took from October 1 through November 22, showed that just under half were a good match for the  influenza A flu strain contained in the current H3N2lu shots for 2014-2015.

"Manchester United have reported record annual revenue of £433.2million and profits of £23.8m for the financial year 2013-2014. The club's sponsorship revenue increased by 49 per cent and commercial revenue soared nearly a quarter to £189.3m. But it cost the club £5.2m to sack manager David Moyes and his coaching staff and projections show their revenue is expected to fall by 10 per cent to between £385m-£395m in the current financial year because of their failure to qualify for the Champions League. YOU CAN LIKE OUR MANCHESTER UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE HERE . Financial update: Man United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward proclaimed himself pleased with the club's latest set of finances as they recorded a record annual revenue of £433m . Compensation: It cost United £5.2m to sack David Moyes and his coaching staff last seaosn . United's wage bill rose 19 per cent to £214.8m, an increase of £34.3m, 'primarily due to the impact of player acquisitions and renegotiated player contracts', according to the annual report. This is the first time United's wage bill has broken the £200m barrier and they are only the second club after Man City to exceed it. This is before the summer acquisitions of Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao, Marco Rojo, Daley Blind, Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera have their impact. The figures also reveal United's sponsorship income increased by 49 per cent last year with a number of new deals coming on stream. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said: 'We are very proud of the results achieved in fiscal year 2014 as we once again generated record revenues driven by our commercial and broadcasting businesses which delivered impressive year-over-year growth. New chapter: Ed Woodward said he was looking forward to success under Louis van Gaal . 'We also recently announced a record-breaking deal with Adidas and very much look forward to launching this partnership next summer. 'With Louis van Gaal at the helm as manager, and the recent signing of some of the world's leading players to further strengthen our squad, we are very excited about the future and believe it's the start of a new chaper in the club's history. 'Louis' footballing philosophy fits very well with Manchester United and he has an impressive track record of success throughout his career, winning league titles with every club he has managed.' Woodward added that despite United's summer spending spree he expects the wage bill drop to due to the exits of high earns Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand Nemanja Vidic.

United finished seventh in the Barclays Premier League last season, their lowest finish in the post-1992 era, and failed to make the Champions League for the first time since 1995. It led to the dismissal of Moyes and the appointment of Louis van Gaal over the summer. United have spent in the region of £150m over the summer on Di Maria, Herrera, Shaw, Rojo, Blind and Falcao as they bid to reassert their dominance in the top flight.

"British spies can help themselves to data collected by the NSA from the telephone calls and Internet communications of Americans without a warrant, a new court document shows. The agreement between the NSA and its British equivalent, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) means that American citizen's data can be seen and stored by the United States' closest ally without a warrant when that is 'not technically feasible'. Anything discovered in the data, once obtained, can be kept by the British for up to two years and specifically relates to 'unselected' or raw data. But, this deadline can be extended unilaterally by 'senior UK officials' if they believe it to be necessary for national security purposes. Special relationship: British spies at GCHQ are allowed to mine American citizen's telephone calls and emails without a warrant and with the agreement of the NSA . The revelation that a foreign nation, even a friendly one, can have unfettered access to American's private communications was revealed during a legal challenge to GCHQ in the UK by civil liberties groups. It is a well known fact that the NSA and GCHQ along with Canada, Australia and New Zealand, share intelligence data with one another. However, this is the first time the British government has admitted it does not need to go through legal hoops to access data mined by its American counterparts claims the National Journal. GCHQ was forced to draw back the veil on some of their top secret policies during a legal challenge to their practices following whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations about the NSA last year. Embattled: The National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters building in Fort Meade, Maryland . Amongst the legal challengers were Amnesty International and the British civil rights advocates, Liberty. 'We now know that data from any call, internet search, or website you visited over the past two years could be stored in GCHQ’s database and analysed at will, all without a warrant to collect it in the first place,' said Privacy International deputy director Eric King to the Guardian. Revelations: Edward Snowden exposed the full extent of the NSA and GCHQ's surveillance on British and American citizens . 'It is outrageous that the government thinks mass surveillance, justified by secret “arrangements” that allow for vast and unrestrained receipt and analysis of foreign intelligence material is lawful.' Generally, the UK's intelligence gathering and data sharing is governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), which generally demands a warrant for private data interception. However, the legal challenge has exposed the fact that the British and GCHQ do not deem a warrant necessary every time. 'A Ripa interception warrant is not as a matter of law required in all cases in which unanalyzed intercepted communications might be sought from a foreign government,' states the document made public and sent by GCHQ to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which is the British intelligence watchdog. Following the revelations of U.S. intelligence worker Edward Snowden, GCHQ has been on the defensive over how it shares data with American spies. British lawmakers briefed by the agency have assured the public that a warrant was in place ""in each case where GCHQ sought information from the U.S."" A Government spokesperson said: ""We do not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.""","Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)  privileged agreement with National Security Agency revealed .

"Mexican drug cartels are now smuggling higher grade and more expensive marijuana grown in the US south of the border. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the alleged smuggling involves marijuana grown by American entrepreneurs in states that allow marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, most recently Oregon and Alaska. DEA spokesman Lawrence Payne said the agency learned of the trafficking from intelligence operations - but said the scale of the operation is not known. The DEA believes Mexican drug cartels are smuggling high-grade marijuana from the US south of the border. Pictured, a Homeland Security operative in a secret tunnel discovered last year between Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, which was linked to the Sinaloa cartel . He told U.S. News:  'Traffickers who are operating in the U.S. are securing marijuana in the U.S. that is much higher quality and more expensive for the purpose of smuggling back into Mexico for sale and distribution. 'Much of this marijuana is being grown [and] obtained in states that have relaxed their marijuana laws, such as Colorado. '[It's] too early to really know the level or scale of the trafficking southward.' Earlier this week, NPR reported that domestic sales of marijuana are undercutting the operations of Mexican cartels - and as a result, the Sinaloa Cartel is smuggling US grown marijuana into Mexico, mainly from Colorado. Mr Payne told the broadcaster: 'It makes sense...If you can buy some really high-quality weed here, why not smuggle it south, too, and sell it at a premium?' It has been reported that domestic sales are undercutting the operations of Mexican drug cartels, who have resorted to smuggling American pot south to sell at a premium . Nabor, a 24-year-old marijuana grower from the northwestern state of Sinaloa, told NPR that if the U.S continues to legalize pot - and more than half of states already have - 'they'll run us into the ground'. But supporters use eliminating the violence associated with cartels and organized crime as an important argument for legalization.","Drug Enforcement Administration says Mexican cartels are trafficking better and more expensive weed south of the border .

"There was chaos on the streets of downtown Hong Kong today as hundreds of masked men attacked barricades erected by pro-democracy demonstrators. The counter-demonstrators pulled at the metal fencing stretching across the roads of central Hong Kong, shouted abuse and picked fights with Occupy protesters.

The masked man is taken away: Pro-democracy protesters claimed they were attacked by members of triad organised crime gangs . CY Leung, chief executive of the former British colony, dismissed the protesters' efforts in an interview with a local television station. 'I believe we all know that the chance is almost zero,' he said of demonstrators' goal of forcing China to allow a free vote in the territory's next election. Responding to calls for his resignation, Mr Leung said last night that his leaving office would not 'solve the problem' and denounced protest leaders for allowing demonstrations to 'spin out of control'. Today several hundred people - mostly men of middle age or older - crowded in front of the Occupy Central barricades chanting 'Open the road!' Some tried to pull down the metal barricades that protesters have set up to block off main roads near the heart of the city's financial district. They also shouted, 'Occupy Central is illegal,' referring to one of the names of the pro-democracy movement that has swept Hong Kong. Taxi drivers also joined in, with some driving their cabs up to the barricades and leaning on their horns to express their anger about the traffic disruptions. They were held back by a line of police officers. Stop it: Police try to stop a masked anti-Occupy Central protester who was using pliers to cut cable ties at barricades .

Police took away some masked men inside the protest zone who tried to pick fights with the protesters. Alex Kwok, an Occupy protester, said he received a scratch on his arm after he was attacked by several men whom he accused of being members of triads, or organised crime gangs. Tens of thousands of people, many of them students, have poured into the streets as part of the protests that began on September 28 to peacefully protest China's restrictions on the first direct election for Hong Kong's leader, promised by Beijing for 2017. Beijing said a 1,200-member committee stacked with pro-government elites should nominate two or three leadership candidates before the public votes. Protesters say this gives them no real choice and do not amount to genuine democracy. The protests are the worst in Hong Kong since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. They pose one of the biggest political challenges for Beijing since it violently crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. When China took control of Hong Kong, it agreed to a policy of 'one country, two systems' which allowed it a high degree of control over its own affairs and kept in place liberties unseen on the mainland. It also promised that the city's leader would eventually be chosen through universal suffrage, and Hong Kong residents have long felt their island stood apart from mainland China thanks to those civil liberties and separate legal and financial systems. At one point tens of thousands of protesters occupied busy roads outside the city government headquarters as well as in two busy shopping districts, but their numbers have since dwindled. You are free to do what we tell you: Jackie Chan has criticised the HK protests . Much-loved kung fu film star Jackie Chan has further cemented his new position as an apparent Chinese communist party stooge with criticism of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests. The star of such classics as Drunken Master and Police Story posted a message on micro-blogging site Weibo saying he was 'worried' by the demonstrations and calling on protesters to 'return to rationality'. His comments more or less parroted the official rhetoric regarding the demonstrations handed down from officials in Beijing and Hong Kong. According to an English translation by the website Shanghaiist, Chan, now 60, wrote: 'I found out through the news that Hong Kong’s economic losses reached HK$350 billion [$45 billion] and I’m really worried... 'I believe every Hong Kong resident loves Hong Kong and wishes it well! Hong Kong’s bright tomorrow requires everyone’s support and hard work... 'In the song ""Country,"" one line goes: ""There is no prosperous home without a strong country."" I am willing to work hard with everyone and return to rationality, to face the future, love our country, love our Hong Kong.' It is not the first time that Chan, a Hong Kong native, has spoken out against public protests - a key democratic freedom. In 2012 he complained 'Hong Kong protests about everything', and even went so far as to suggest there should be rules about what people can protest about. Jackie Chan's son Jaycee Chan is currently in trouble with the law in China after he was arrested for allowing others to take drugs at his Beijing home. Jaycee, 32, was in August held alongside Taiwan-based movie star Kai Ko after police found them with nearly four ounces of cannabis at Chan's property in the Chinese capital's Dongcheng district.","Hong Kong's Beijing-backed chief executive says protesters have 'almost zero' chance of meeting their objectives .

Chris Rushworth rewrote Durham's history books with 15 wickets in 20 overs in their innings victory over Northamptonshire. But what else is known about the 28-year-old seamer? Few outside Durham, and perhaps not that many inside either, will be able to tell you much about an unheralded ex-Northumberland Minor Counties cricketer who is making the most of his second shot at the professional game after being released by his current employers seven years ago. Undeterred, the Sunderland-born cousin of Durham and former England wicketkeeper Phil Mustard, fought his way back into the reckoning after spells selling satellite dishes and working in a call centre. In that time, coincidentally, Northants were one of two other counties to reject him after a trial - and Rushworth went back to club cricket with Sunderland to try to catch Durham's eye again. It worked - and in 53 first-class matches before his date with destiny in an end-of-season championship fixture at home to relegated Northants, he had taken a 167 wickets at a laudable average of 26.5. Balding, Rushworth cuts a throwback figure to another recent Durham favourite Neil Killeen - and he was a near ever-present in his team's unexpected march last summer to a third championship title in six seasons. Others then grabbed most of the headlines nonetheless, but this time the limelight is his alone.","Chris Rushworth claims incredible nine wickets for Durham in first innings .

"Former Arsenal title-winner Alan Smith believes the club's Premier League challenge this season is already over and the best that they can achieve is another top four finish. The Gunners left it late to defeat Southampton 1-0 at home on Wednesday night courtesy of an Alexis Sanchez strike - a result that moves the Gunners up to sixth in the Premier League. However, Smith feels the gap between the Emirates outfit and league leaders Chelsea is already insurmountable after 14 matches, despite Arsene Wenger's belief that they can still overhaul Jose Mourinho's side.

Alexis Sanchez (right) scored in the 89th minute to give the Gunners a 1-0 win against Southampton . The Blues are unbeaten this season and sit top of the table on 36 points - 13 ahead of their bitter London rivals - and the former England striker is adamant Arsenal must set their sights lower and focus on achieving qualification for the Champions League next season. Speaking on TalkSPORT's Hawksbee and Jacobs show, the 1988-89 and 1990-91 First Division winner with Arsenal said: 'I can see them having a good run, they have done it in years gone by, but I can't see them getting the kind of results that give them that proper belief that they are title challengers. 'I think they are a better team going forward now, without question, but you look back to their defensive weaknesses and think of the Anderlecht game, the Swansea game, the Man United game and have they erased it from their game? 'We will have to see when they come up against better opposition in the months to come. I don't see them as a title-challenging team. 'They will finish in the top four, no danger.

"As comebacks go, this was roughly comparable to watching your favourite singer return to the stage in the twilight of their career - and finding they can barely hold a note. The best thing about Tiger Woods’s eagerly awaited return on Thursday was that he got to the 18th green and was neither limping or clutching his back. His golf? Oh dear. An opening tee shot that sailed out of bounds was shocking enough but to see the man who has played more great chip shots than any man in history cold-duff no fewer than four during his 18 holes was positively toe-curling. Tiger Woods tees off at the fifthhole during the first round of the Hero World Challenge tournament . Woods tees off on the seventh  at Hero World Challenge event, where he shot a five-over round of 77 . Woods began with a woeful tee shot on the first hole and only made one birdie throughout his round . In an 18-man field at the Hero World Challenge, Woods finished 18th after a decidedly unheroic opening round of 77. Woods told pgatour.com: 'It was weird. I didn't feel like I hit it that bad. My short game was awful, and I didn't make anything. It was just one of those days where nothing went my way. 'I hit a lot of good shots and I got nothing out of it, obviously. Bad chips, bad putts and a couple of missed shots on the front nine on the wrong side really compounded the problem. 'I hit terrible chips - that's something I need to work on when I get home. It certainly is surprising that I could hit chips that poorly.' It left him a mile behind Jordan Spieth, as the remarkable 21 year old American continued from where he left off on Sunday, when he won the Australian Open with a brilliant final round 63. He stood six under for his first round, while Graeme McDowell, twice a winner of this event, shot a fine 68. To be fair to Woods, there were plenty of sound reasons for putting this horror round down to rust and lack of competitive edge. It’s four months since he last played but it’s at least twice as long as that in reality, given there were plenty of issues with his back long before he finally gave in to reason last August. Goodness, did it show. Yet in the build-up there were plenty of pundits who expected him to turn in a good first round. For a start, physically he looked great. He played in the pro-am on Wednesday, shot two under par, with the fluid, remodelled swing under new coach Chris Como drawing rave reviews. Woods has an awkward follow through after playing a chip shot on the seventh hole . Woods looks out at the course during his comeback round at the Hero World Challenge tournament . Jordan Spieth continued his electric form at the Hero World Challenge on Thursday with a six-under 66 . The Isleworth venue is a course he’s played hundreds of times since he used to live next to the driving range. So to his opening blow. Over the years we’ve seen some amazingly bad opening tee shots from someone so good. At the Open in 2003 he lost a ball, which took some doing on a hole lined by 10,000 people. At the Masters he once missed not only the first fairway but the adjacent ninth as well. At the 2006 Ryder Cup he finished in a lake that wasn’t on the radar. Here was another spectacular contribution. An easy par four with a 40 yard wide fairway, Woods hooked it so badly it sailed out of bounds, finishing in the swimming pool in someone’s backyard. Now that’s what you call a water hazard. Woods did make a birdie with his provisional ball to limit the damage to a single dropped shot but another miss to the left on the difficult par three second meant a bogey-bogey start. Then it got worse. At the 7th he failed to get out of a greenside bunker. At the 8th, after almost finding another backyard with another errant approach, he stubbed a chip that barely travelled a foot. The resultant double bogey, followed by a rare par at the 9th, meant a front nine played in 41 shots. On a course where he once shot 59 for 18 holes. By that stage he was already ten shots behind Spieth. Woods wipes his face on the third tee during the first round of the Hero World Challenge . Woods (right) talks with new swing coach Chris Como (left) during Wednesday's Pro-Am competition . Steve Stricker was also making his comeback after being out for the same time as Woods, and shot 67 . Over the back nine there were some encouraging signs. The swing certainly looks far more natural and, after hitting just one fairway on the front nine, he started locating some on the inward half. At the 12th, his approach almost finished in the hole for a tap-in birdie. Another looked likely at the par five 13th, when his second shot landed just 10ft from the hole. But, as all Isleworth members know, there’s a slope here that throws the ball off the green to the right if you’re too aggressive, and that’s what happened. From there, Woods clunked not one chip shot but two, and walked off with a shattering bogey six. When he did it again at the 16th, he looked ready to explode. It’s going to take some time, isn’t it? Meanwhile, 46-year-old Steve Stricker was also playing his first round since the USPGA Championship in August. He breezed round in 67.","Tiger Woods made four bogeys and a double bogey in  five-over-par 77 .

"The primary air traffic control system around Los Angeles shut down last week because data from the a U-2 spy plane's flight plan confused software that helps track and route aircraft around the region, the Federal Aviation Administration said Monday. When the system failed Wednesday, a backup helped safely guide flights already in the air, but hundreds of planes across the nation headed for Southern California were ordered not to take off as an air traffic control facility about 40 miles north of Los Angeles effectively rebooted. The problem had nothing to do with spy-related signals sent by the Cold War-era plane. Hidden disruption: A Cold War-era U.S. Air Force U-2 spy plane forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights at and around LAX on Wednesday afternoon . The plane flies at around 60,000 feet under 'visual flight rules.' According to the FAA, a computer perceived a conflict between the altitude and the use of visual flight rules, and began trying to route the plane to 10,000 feet. The number of adjustments that would need to be made to routes of other planes throughout the area overwhelmed the software. 'The extensive number of routings that would have been required to deconflict the aircraft with lower-altitude flights used a large amount of available memory and interrupted the computer's other flight-processing functions,' the FAA said in a statement. The Pentagon confirmed Monday that an Air Force U-2 spy plane was conducting training operations in the area. It is not unusual for a U-2 to operate in the region, and the necessary flight plan had been submitted for the high-flying plane, Col. Steve Warren said. Going nowhere: Hundreds of flights were either cancelled or diverted from Los Angeles Airport, one of the countries biggest airports. The FAA announced on Monday that it was the high-flying plane's complex flight plan that overloaded flight tracking systems, not 'spy signals' The connection between the U-2 and the outage was first reported by NBC News. Since the incident, the FAA has been analyzing what went wrong with its En Route Automation Modernization system. The computer system, known as ERAM, allows air traffic controllers at several dozen 'en route centers' around the country to identify and direct planes at high altitudes. The Los Angeles en route center controls high altitude air traffic over southern and central California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah and western Arizona - except airspace designated for military use. In its statement, the FAA said it has adjusted ERAM to require altitude details for flight plans. 'The FAA is confident these steps will prevent a reoccurrence of this specific problem and other potential similar issues going forward,' the agency said. When the system failed, air traffic controllers in Southern California had to call their counterparts at neighboring centers to update them on each plane's flight plan, according to Nate Pair, the president for Los Angeles Center of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. While that was more onerous than normal operations - when computers automatically pass along updates - the system still worked, Pair said. Time to upgrade? Computer software at the L.A. Air Route Traffic Control Center in Palmdale, California (pictured) was unable to distinguish between commercial aircraft and the spy plane which was flying miles above .","Glitch occurred on Wednesday afternoon at 2 p.m.

"Syed Tufail Haider, 45, (not pictured) was allegedly hacked to death by Assistant Sub-Inspector Faraz Naveed for insulting the Prophet while in custody . A police officer allegedly hacked a suspect to death with an axe during an interrogation after he uttered 'derogatory remarks' about the Prophet. Syed Tufail Haider, 45, was arrested for wounding two people in Gujrat, Pakistan, but got into a heated argument with Assistant Sub-Inspector  Faraz Naveed while in custody. The senior police officer then allegedly struck Mr Haider on the neck with an axe lying in the room at Civil Lines station, a blow which resulted in immediate death, according to the authorities. This comes just two days after a Christian labourer and his pregnant wife were beaten to death and burned on top of a brick kiln for throwing out a dead relative's Koran in Pakistan. Sub-Inspector Naveed accused Mr Haider of blasphemy and hurling abuse at officers, with other police officials saying the arrested man was mentally unsound. 'Tufail was kept in the lock-up but he continued uttering derogatory remarks and hurled abuse at policemen. He looked like a malang (wandering preacher) and seemed mentally imbalanced,' duty officer Ali Raza told AFP. 'Assistant Sub-Inspector Faraz Naveed, 36, became very angry on hearing the derogatory remarks against the companions of the Prophet and he killed the detainee with an axe in the lock up,' he added. Police have arrested ASI Faraz Naveed and taken the axe into custody. The body of the Mr Haider has been sent to a local hospital for a post-mortem. Chief Minister Punjab Shahbaz Sharif has ordered a further investigation of the incident. Mr Haider was believed to be a member of the minority Shia sect of Islam. Christian couple Shama Bibi (left) and Shehzad Masih were murdered in Pakistan after a mob accused them of desecrating a copy of the Koran . They were beaten to death and thrown onto a brick kiln (pictured) and by the time the attack was over, only charred bones and the couple's discarded shoes remained . Around 1,000 Shias have been killed in the past two years in Pakistan, a heavy toll on the community that makes up roughly 20 percent of the country's 180 million-strong population. There has been a recent surge in extra-judicial killings linked to Pakistan's blasphemy laws. These were put in place during the period of British rule and strengthened by former military ruler General Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s. Shehzad Masih and Shama Bibi - who was four months pregnant and a mother to three children - were beaten to death and burned two days ago. The killing was sparked by the mob's belief the couple had desecrated a copy of the Koran. By the time the attack was over, only charred bones and the couple's discarded shoes remained. The gruesome incident took place yesterday in the tiny hamlet of Chak 59 near Kot Radha Kishan town, 60 kilometres southwest of Lahore.

"Seventeen years ago the McCaughey children grabbed headlines for being the first world's first set of surviving septuplets. Now, all grown-up, high school juniors Kenny, Kelsey, Natalie, Brandon, Alexis, Nathan and Joel are gearing up to leave the family home in Des Moines, Iowa, and go solo. Several of the teenagers have revealed that they're dating, with Brandon recently celebrating the ten-month mark with his girlfriend and Kelsey happy with a boyfriend of one year. Scroll down for video . Full household: Seventeen years ago the McCaughey children grabbed headlines for being the first world's first set of surviving septuplets. Dinner times: Now, all grown-up, high school juniors Kenny, Kelsey, Natalie, Brandon, Alexis, Nathan and Joel are gearing up to leave the family home in Des Moines, Iowa, and go solo . In an episode of Oprah: Where Are They Now? airing on Sunday night their parents talked about what it was like raising such a large brood. Meals are served buffet style and 15 to 17 loads of laundry get done per week. Family matriarch, Bobbi, 46, said that food shopping remains one of the biggest struggles and she buys everything in bulk in a bid to cut costs. She recently snapped up 60lbs of hamburgers after spotting them on sale at a local grocery store and she grows fresh produce in the garden. Happy and healthy: Natalie, left in hospital and right today, is a promising student and hopes to teach . Strong: Brandon, pictured left and right, enjoys wrestling and hopes to join the military after graduating . Tiny: Kelsey was the lightest baby at 2lb 5oz but she now enjoys soccer and wants a career in cosmetology . Hard workers: Kenny, left, also enjoys wrestling at school, woodworking, fishing and playing the drums . Fighter: Alexis, who suffers from cerebral palsy, is in cheerleading as a manager and hopes to teach . Impressive: Nathan, who also has cerebral palsy, hopes for a career in science after school . Last but not least: Joel was the 8th to be born, weighing just 2lbs 15oz. He now runs track and plays trombone . 'We plant a lot of tomatoes because we use a lot of tomatoes. Beans are what's in season right now,' the mother-of-eight said while giving a tour of her allotment. Bobbi and her husband Kenny, who already had one daughter, famously declined selective reduction after learning they were pregnant with seven children following fertility treatment, saying it was 'in God's hands'. 'I will always remember the day we found out there were so many,' Bobbi previously told the Des Moines Register. 'It wasn't like ""yoohoo!"" There were so many doubts. To a lot of people this might sound trite, but God determined the outcome.' Learning they had septuplets on the way sparked international headlines that would chart the children's every move. After the babies were born nine weeks prematurely in Des Moines on November 19 1997, joining their big sister, Mikayla Marie, news crews swarmed their modest one-floor home. Amid the media frenzy, President Bill Clinton personally called the family to congratulate the family, Oprah welcomed them on her show and companies and strangers scrambled to help out the couple. Among the donations, they received a 5,500 square foot home, a van, a year's worth of Kraft's macaroni and cheese, diapers for the first two years and full college scholarships for any state university in Iowa. During the early months, the septuplets drank 42 bottles a day and went through 52 diapers.

Proud: Bobbi holds Kenny Jr as she sits beside Kenny and NBC host Ann Curry four days after the births . Bursting: Bobbi lies at Iowa Methodist Hospital Center in Des Moines before giving birth . But over the years, the media coverage has waned and the coupons for free food have run out - encouraging the family to be frugal. These days, the family spends at least $300 a month on groceries, shopping at food warehouses. And from their early teenage years, the septuplets have been helping out the family by carrying out chores, such as their own laundry. The family still lives in the same house that was donated after the births and continues to use the same van. And while the four boys and three girls are now of driving age, their father, who still works at a metal coating plant, warned that they can only have cars once they get jobs. 'If they want to drive, then they have to save up and buy their own car,' Kenny said, adding that ''they're getting there.' He is also up against other teenage challenges. 'The biggest challenge is making sure they keep up with certain things but not keep up with certain things, trendy things,' Kenny said of his teenagers. 'Three of them have cellphones and a couple have iPads.' Tiny fighters: The babies in incubators in hospital in Des Moines, Iowa . Challenge: During the early months, the septuplets drank 42 bottles a day and went through 52 diapers . Flashback: The septuplets on the Oprah Show to mark their first birthdays . The family has saved to cover braces for several of the children and the medical needs of Alexis and Nathan, who were born with forms of cerebral palsy. Both of the children had surgeries, including a spinal surgery to help Nathan walk, over the years but they are doing well, the Des Moines Register reported. Alexis has also started taking part in beauty pageants for special needs children, taking the 2013 Teen Miss Dreams Made True award in Carroll. 'It feels really awesome,' Alexis told the Carrolls Paper at the time. 'I love just interacting with all the girls because they're really nice.' Amid the life lessons and support from their parents, the teens are also battling classes at school. In 2012 they began high school and have become fully immersed in activities; all are part of the band and perform at halftime at football games. No room in the inn: The family still lives in the same house that was donated after the births and continues to use the same van .

Savvy-shopper: She recently snapped up 60lbs of hamburgers after spotting them on sale at a local grocery store and she grows fresh produce in the garden . Five have run cross country, another wrestles, one plays soccer and another enters speech contests, while six were on the honor roll, the Register reported. 'It's fun to see the work pay off,' Bobbi said of her children. As their lives have become busier, they have fallen from television screens and magazines - from Time magazine to Dateline NBC - that they regularly graced throughout their childhoods. While Bobbi said she missed the media, the children are less bothered. 'It was kinda cool but in other ways I never liked it, all these cameras following you around everywhere,' Nathan said. With high school graduation on the horizon, the McCaughey teens will soon go their separate ways. Their father Kenny concluded: 'The kids are getting better at doing their own thing. It's just the gradual road to individual living.'","Kenny, Kelsey, Natalie, Brandon, Alexis, Nathan and Joel McCaughey, from Carlisle, Iowa, celebrated their 17th birthdays in November .

He's really been in good form. 'The last get-together he was obviously in our minds but we didn't choose him because of the importance of the two Under 21 qualifiers against Croatia. 'But this time they only have a friendly match, so there's no reason to pass over his credentials yet again.' Hodgson has also opted to hand Theo Walcott an immediate recall to his squad, despite the Arsenal winger having only played 11 minutes of Premier League football since his return from a serious knee injury.

"For Dennis Wise, one incident encapsulated what it was like to be a member of Wimbledon's infamous Crazy Gang as they changed the landscape of English football in the 1980s. 'Our new centre-half Eric Young kept turning up for training with his Brighton bag,' recalls Wise. 'We'd had enough of it so it got burnt. It was our way of saying, you're not with Brighton any more, you're with Wimbledon. We stick together and do everything together. That was the culture back then.' Wise is going down memory lane to promote a new TV film about the assortment of misfits and failures who helped make the Wimbledon story. It's a tale of how a club went from non-league to FA Cup winners at Wembley in just 11 years, through a mixture of hunger, talent, chaos and casual violence. Dennis Wise, Vinnie Jones and Terry Phelan celebrate Wimbledon's shock FA Cup victory back in 1988 . The Crazy Gang, who beat Liverpool  in the '88 final, were famed for their antics on and off the field . Wimbledon midfielder Lawrie Sanchez looks on after heading the winning goal against Liverpool . Goalkeeper Dave Beasant dives to his left to deny Liverpool striker John Aldridge from the penalty spot . For Barnado's boy John Fashanu, hod carrier Vinnie Jones and Southampton reject Wise, being part of the Crazy Gang was a platform to achieve even greater things in and out of football. Others like Young, a trained accountant, were less taken with the aggressive nature of the club, and don't feature in the hour-long programme which was screened to the media on Thursday night and will later be shown on BT Sport, on Boxing Day of course. Many of the Wimbledon anecdotes are well-known, like chairman Sam Hammam forcing his players to eat sheep testicles in a forerunner to I'm a Celebrity. Jones – now a Hollywood actor – reveals in the programme they also set fire to team-mate Alan Cork's car so he could plead poverty for a new contract, and said he was startled by the way Fashanu in particular intimidated young players at the club, and opponents. 'Fash the Bash' as he is known is accused in the programme of beating up a player 'like a rag doll'. 'You either grew a backbone very quickly or you dissolved as a man,' admitted Jones. Wise admits players at Wimbledon either 'grew a backbone very quickly or you dissolved as a man' Wise, now 47 and out football since he left Newcastle United as executive director in 2009, admits: 'You couldn't do some of the things we did nowadays. Player have to be a bit more disciplined than in our time, it was quite handy there weren't camera phones around then or some very big stories would have come out. 'Times were different then. We were young, learning things and we had some fun. At the time, we didn't think we were being that unusual but 25 years later, you do think 'Wow', what the team achieved from where all the players had come from. For a lot of us, it was a second chance, most of us hadn't quite made it and the timing put us all together. You could imagine the steps people like Vinnie would take. 'People looked at us in a way they perhaps shouldn't have because we were eager to learn and we had decent players. I realised straight away they had something different about them, and when Vinnie came two months after me, we hit it off straight away. He was best man at my wedding and whenever he's over in England, we meet up. We've been to a Watford game this season and I got a text from him this week from where he lives in America.' For players like Wise and Jones, Wimbledon was a second chance for a number who hadn't made it . Wimbledon were hated by the football establishment. They became known as a long-ball team under Dave Bassett. When Bobby Gould took over and appointed Don Howe, one of English football's most respected coaches, the Wimbledon players told him in no uncertain terms the way they liked to play, and could he improve them within those confines. Howe originally only meant to stay for a few weeks but ended up being an important part of their FA Cup success in 1988. Even then, the underdogs did it their way against mighty Liverpool. Jones and others chanted 'Yidaho' as a rallying cry in the tunnel before the game to the bemusement of Liverpool's stars and the midfielder then sent Steve McMahon, Liverpool's hard-man, flying in the first minute. Wimbledon won the final 1-0 with Lawrie Sanchez heading in Wise's free-kick. 'There were some big personalities in that dressing-room,' said Wise. 'Not just Vinnie and Fash, but Sanch, Andy Thorn, Dave Beasant. They had a desire that whatever they did, it would be to the best of their ability. I had a big personality within the group even though I wasn't so big in stature. They knew if they needed someone, I was there with them. I was accepted by the group, we relied on each other. Jones and striker John Fashanu were two of the biggest characters in the Wimbledon dressing room . 'It hasn't surprised me that Fash went on to present Gladiators and then became a big businessman, or that Vinnie is in Hollywood. They were very ambitious and wanted to achieve things in football, and after.' Wise and Jones during a poker tournament in 2006 . Some players didn't react well to the verbal and physical intensity in the group as they competed with the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal on crowds of less than 10,000. Irish international defender Terry Phelan, who later went to Manchester City, says on film: 'I saw players actually cry from the abuse – physically break down and cry.' Wise, who stands 5ft 6ins and was just 18 when he stepped into Plough Lane, is thankful he was spared any initiation ceremony. 'I was lucky. Wally (Downes, the assistant manager and many say the creator of the Crazy Gang) knew my parents, they were good friends so they probably weren't so harsh on me as others. They more like took me under their wing. 'I had been there for a two-week trial and after four days I was lucky enough that (manager) Dave Bassett wanted to sign me. Geoff Taylor who looked after the youth didn't, but Dave liked that work ethic I had. I was always at the front in training, would always win the long-distance running and didn't mind spending time out on the pitch and practising. 'It was a complicated situation because I'd turned down a new contract at Southampton, went on trial to Crystal Palace but they didn't want me, went back to Southampton and Lawrie (McMenemy) said the contract offer was no longer on the table. So a guy called Pat Deller, who was a taxi driver but did scouting for Wimbledon, suggested me to them.' The way Wise ended up at the Crazy Gang wasn't unusual. Jones had been non-league player with Wealdstone when he signed, John Scales had been released by Leeds United and was finding his way again with Bristol Rovers when he was picked up by the Dons. Many of the Wimbledon team had been released by Football League clubs or spent time in the non-League . It was one of the features of why the Crazy Gang happened. Wise admits some of the stunts could not be repeated but insists teams spirit and camaraderie is still vital to success. 'I've been lucky enough to go down to watch Chelsea train, I know John Terry very well (they were Chelsea team-mates) and Jose Mourinho was good enough to let me down there. 'John knows it doesn't matter if the players speak a different language, they have to be together and at Chelsea you can sense it. It doesn't matter where you've come from, it's only important that you are together. That is what Wimbledon was about to me.'

"A shipwrecked crew have been rescued after becoming stranded in shark-riddled waters during the round-the-world Volvo Ocean Race. The nine-men Team Vestas crew crashed on a remote coral reef before they were picked up and taken to Mauritius. Shore crew chief Neil Cox told the BBC: 'We've had nine guys sitting on a sand spit in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The coastguard was asking me to warn the guys that the reef is riddled full of sharks and barracuda.' Team Vestas were stranded on a deserted island after crashing during the Volvo Ocean Race .

The fleet of seven vessels were making their way from Cape Town to Abu Dhabi - the second stage of the nine-leg race - and expected to reach the United Arab Emirates on December 13. Team Vestas captain Chris Nicholson said they would attempt to rescue their damaged craft before rejoining the race for the start of the fourth stage starting in in Sanya, China, in February 2015. Nicholson said: 'I'm really disappointed. On the other hand, we have to realise how fortunate we are. 'It's clear that human error is responsible for the shipwreck, there's no avoiding that. And as skipper, I take ultimate responsibility. Nicholson is still hoping the damaged boat can be retrieved and repaired to join the race at a later stage . The crew carry belongings from the boat onto the mainland in Mauritius . 'The past four days have been very challenging for all of us, and I am extremely proud of the whole crew's professionalism, composure, and endurance.' After crashing on Saturday, the crew were forced to wade through knee deep water before finding a dray location to wait for their rescuers on Sunday morning. They were taken by a coastguard boat to a small deserted islet called Ile du Sud, popular with shark-watching day-tourists, before completing their journey on a weekly fishing vessel.","The Volvo Ocean Race spans 39,379 nautical miles and visits 11 countries .

"Louis van Gaal has played down his role in the development of Jose Mourinho, insisting the Chelsea manager became the Special One all by himself. Van Gaal faces the toughest test of his reign as Manchester United manager on Sunday when unbeaten league leaders Chelsea come to Old Trafford. In the away dugout will be a man Van Gaal first crossed paths with 17 years ago when the Dutchman offered the then 34-year-old coach a position on his coaching staff at Barcelona. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho say Louis van Gaal deserves his chance . Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has played down his role in Jose Mourinho's success as a boss . Van Gaal insists Chelsea manager Mourinho (pictured) became the Special One all by himself . Mourinho spent three years by Van Gaal's side and the relationship worked perfectly, with Barca winning two Primera Division titles and the Copa del Rey while the two men were stationed in the home dugout. Mourinho has since forged a hugely successful career of his own which has yielded an astounding 20 trophies to date. The Portuguese often credits a lot of his success to Van Gaal and his other mentor Sir Bobby Robson, but the Manchester United manager thinks the main reason behind Mourinho's success is the man himself. 'He talks about Louis van Gaal and also Bobby Robson, and I appreciate that, but you always do it by yourself,' Van Gaal said. 'I was also an apprentice when I was the assistant coach of Leo Beenhakker (at Ajax) and it's good that my eyes were also open at that time. 'And it's good that Jose Mourinho's eyes were very open when he was my assistant, but you do it by yourself.' Mourinho has riled many leading figures in football, whether it be in Portugal, Italy, Spain or England. Just three weeks ago he was tussling with Arsene Wenger, the man he called a 'specialist in failure' in February. Mourinho, then Inter Milan manager, greets Van Gaal, who was boss of Bayern Munich at the time . The 51-year-old has been viewed as a somewhat arrogant figure ever since he proclaimed himself the 'Special One' when he arrived at Chelsea 10 years ago, so it was with some surprise that Van Gaal chose to describe Mourinho as 'modest' at his pre-match press conference on Friday. And, anyone who turned up to the media briefing hoping to hear about a breakdown in relationship between the two men due to the fact that they are now domestic rivals, was disappointed. Indeed, Van Gaal had nothing but kind words to say about his former assistant. 'He's such a wonderful coach,' Van Gaal added. 'And to see that he's been a champion in different countries is fantastic. 'He is a very modest and emotional human being, and I like that. 'He's very special but he is very special for me because I've worked with him and we've continued our relationship, which in the football world is not always normal. That's nice.' Van Gaal had nothing but kind words to say about Mourinho ahead of their clash at Old Trafford on Sunday . Van Gaal says Mourinho is 'a wonderful coach' and that seeing him become a champion has been 'fantastic' One of the hallmarks of Mourinho's management career has been his propensity to engage in mind-games with his rivals. The Portuguese has kept the public guessing with his updates on the fitness of star striker Diego Costa in recent weeks. Mourinho said he did not expect Costa to start against United when he spoke following Chelsea's win over Maribor on Wednesday, but at his pre-match press conference two days later, he said the striker had a 'little chance' of recovering from his illness to play. Van Gaal appears to believe the Spain striker, who moved to Stamford Bridge in a £32million move from Atletico Madrid this summer, will start. 'I think that he [Mourinho] shall play with him when he can because he wants to win,' the Dutchman added.

Mourinho has kept the public guessing with updates on the fitness of star striker Diego Costa in recent weeks . Mourinho may have trouble selecting a striker for the clash with main man Costa (pictured) unlikely to make it . 'Of course he can play maybe because he has trained individually, I have heard and read (that) on the websites. I also have my eyes always open! 'He's scored nine out of seven - that is remarkable. So he's in good shape, I think, but he was ill yesterday, so you never know.' Angel di Maria is fit for Manchester United's crunch match against Chelsea. CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL STORY! Van Gaal confirmed United's own star Angel di Maria, has been passed fit after he overcame the thigh injury he suffered in the 2-2 draw against West Brom on Monday. The draw at the Hawthorns underlined the difference between United and Chelsea so far this term. Thanks to the addition of Costa and Cesc Fabregas, the Blues have brutally swept almost everyone before them so far this term and rightly sit atop the Barclays Premier League. United, on the other hand, have performed inconsistently, leaving them some 10 points behind the league leaders, much to Van Gaal's disappointment. 'Chelsea are one of the top teams,' he said. 'They are playing like a team and I want my team to do that as well, for a full 90 minutes.' Angel di Maria is fit for Manchester United's crunch match against Chelsea on Sunday at Old Trafford .

Lineker kicked off the discussion by tweeting to his 3.49million followers: 'I know he cocked up, but I like that John Stones was brave enough to attempt to dribble out from the back. Wonderfully un English. #WHUEVE.' To which Carragher replied just four minutes later: 'It wasn't brave it was stupid! Had 3 men to beat on the edge of his own box!! Although a man in the world 11 would have as well.' Former Leicester and Tottenham striker Lineker believes young English players should be applauded for trying to take the game to the opposition, however Carragher again stated there is a time and place for such tactics. Lineker said to Carragher: 'Thought you might disagree with that one. He'll learn when to do it, but so many English defenders lack the balls to try and play.' Sky Sports pundit Carragher responded: 'I agree, he shows for the ball is willing to step in to midfield as well. But taking on 3 men on the edge of the box is madness,' to which Lineker replied: ' I like madness, but then I was a striker!' The conversation came to an end when Carragher concluded: 'As a striker you'd love a defender dribbling out! Would imagine it was Sharp doing the tackling though!!' We take it Carragher was referring to Lineker's former Everton team-mate, Scottish striker Graeme Sharp.

Alaa says he has been feeding and taking care of the cats for over two months. Aleppo, the country's largest city, has been at the centre of some of the fiercest fighting since a major rebel offensive in July 2012.

The city is also being encircled by barbaric Islamic State militants who have captured swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq in their bid to create a caliphate across the two countries. It means the city could see an escalation in fighting if the Islamic fighters make their way into the city. The West is also intensifying its bombing campaign against the terror group. But some Syrians see the U.S-led strikes as serving Assad's interests because they do not target government forces and because some have hit the Nusra Front, Syria's Al Qaeda affiliate that has battled both the Islamic State and the president's forces.

"Ronnie O’Sullivan finished off with a brilliant 147 break as he stormed into the quarter-finals of the Coral UK Championship with a 6-0 demolition of Matthew Selt. O’Sullivan’s maximum at the end of the fourth-round clash at York’s Barbican Centre was the 109th in snooker history and the 13th of the Englishman’s career - improving his own all-time record. The 38-year-old, who had a scare when the final blue wobbled in the jaws of the middle pocket before dropping, is set to earn £44,000 for the break, which is the first of the tournament. Ronnie O'Sullivan punches the air in celebration after finishing the match with a break of 147 . O'Sullivan beat Mattew Selt 6-0 in the fourth round of the Coral UK Championship .

Anthony McGill (Sco) v Ronnie O'Sullivan (Eng) Graeme Dott (Sco) v Stuart Bingham (Eng) Marco Fu (HK) v Stephen Maguire (Sco) / David Morris (Ire) Mark Davis (Eng) v Judd Trump (Eng) Making the achievement even more remarkable is that the five-time world champion is playing on a broken left ankle, sustained while out running in Essex last week. Such was the pain of the injury that O'Sullivan suggested after his first-round victory he might have to withdraw from the tournament if there was no improvement. However, O'Sullivan played through the pain and on Thursday rewarded the watching public - and even fellow players Stephen Maguire and David Morris who briefly stopped their fourth-round encounter on the neighbouring table to follow the action - to another potting masterclass. O'Sullivan, who rattled in four half-century breaks as well as his maximum as he swept aside Selt, will play Anthony McGill for a place in the semi-finals as he continues his hunt for a fifth UK Championship crown, and first since 2007. It was the 13th maximum of O'Sullivan's career as he extended his own personal all-time record . Matthew Selt was well and truly outclassed as he failed to win a single frame against O'Sullivan . Marco Fu and Shaun Murphy served up another dramatic encounter at the UK Championship before the Hong Kong potter sealed his place in the quarter-finals with a 6-5 win. Murphy beat Fu 10-9 in a tense 2008 final and the pair went the distance again on Thursday, with the match being decided on the final black. The Englishman had looked on course to seal a place in the last eight when he built a 5-3 lead - helped by a superb 137 in the fifth frame - but Fu battled back to level things up at 5-5. Murphy again seemed to have the edge in the final frame but, after compiling a break of 54, he snookered himself on the final yellow and Fu did not let his opportunity slip, the 36-year-old potting all the colours to take the decider 74-62. Marco Fu beat Shaun Murphy 6-5 in a thrilling encounter at the Barbican Centre in York . Murphy managed to open up a 5-3 lead against his opponent before losing the next three frames . Judd Trump, the 2011 champion, also took his place in the last eight during Thursday’s afternoon session after overcoming veteran Rod Lawler 6-3. The Bristolian started off with a 102 break in the opener but then lost the next two frames as the world number 66 briefly gave his 25-year-old opponent a scare. However, Trump responded by winning five of the next six frames after that, sealing the win with another century - 112 - in the ninth to set up a quarter-final clash with Mark Davis.","O'Sullivan beat Matthew Selt 6-0 in fourth round of UK Championship .

But it was not until last year that a British team working with the Institute of Karst Geology in Guilan, China revealed its true size. ‘To me, this is like discovering that K2 [the Himalayan peak] is larger than Everest,’ Tim Allen, an expedition co-leader who studied the Chinese cave, told National Geographic. The cave would comfortably fit a Boeing 747 - if you could get one in there - and is located about 325ft (100 metres) underground.

"Modern lifestyles are often blamed for causing blocked arteries but our long-dead ancestors suffered from the same unhealthy symptoms, claim scientists. The remarkably preserved mummies from five ancient cultures – including Egyptians living 3,000 years ago – bear the unmistakeable hallmarks of heart disease. CT scans of hundreds of bodies found atherosclerosis, the narrowing of the arteries due to build-up of fatty deposits, which is the underlying disease process that causes heart attack and strokes. Modern lifestyles are often blamed for causing blocked arteries but our long-dead ancestors suffered from the same unhealthy symptoms, claim scientists. The remarkably preserved mummies from five ancient cultures - including Egyptians living 3,000 years ago - bear the unmistakeable hallmarks of heart disease (illustrated) Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of heart attacks and strokes caused by lack of blood to the brain. Until now it had been widely assumed that today's high rates of heart and artery disease were chiefly the result of unhealthy modern lifestyles. It is though that diets rich in saturated fat encourage the deposit of fatty layers on artery walls which harden over time. As a result blood vessels become narrower and the flow of blood is impeded. When insufficient blood reaches the heart muscle or brain it can trigger a heart attack or stroke. But the triggers must have been very different from those afflicting us in modern times, it is claimed. Instead of a high fat diet, cigarette smoking and obesity being to blame, it is more likely our forebears suffered repeated infections, parasites and the ill-effects of breathing in smoke from cooking fires. The researchers examined 76 Egyptians from 3,000 years ago, 51 Peruvians from 600 to 2,000 years ago, five Native Americans from 1,600 years ago, a small group of 500 year old Mongolians and five Aleutian Islanders from 150 years ago. Only the ancient Egyptians wealthy enough to undergo the 70-day mummification process might have enjoyed the fat-laden diet and sedentary lifestyle commonly associated with the disease. Yet atherosclerosis was discovered in common people from the other four cultures, whose bodies were left to dry out in extremely hot or fiercely cold climates after short, brutish lives as hunter gatherers or nomads. The findings suggest that genetically humans may be inherently susceptible to atherosclerosis. Dr Gregory Thomas, medical director at Long Beach Memorial in California, said its discovery among many ancient cultures means obesity, diet and smoking are not the only culprits. CT scans like the one pictured of hundreds of bodies found artherosclerosis, the narrowing of the arteries due to build-up of fatty deposits, which is the underlying disease process that causes heart attack and strokes . This is not the first time that scans of Ancient Egyptian mummies have revealed heart disease. It was revealed in April that scans of 4,000-year-old mummies showed evidence of hardening of the arteries. Earlier studied have revealed fatty arteries in a large number of Egyptian mummies, which experts put down to their luxurious, fatty diets. Atherosclerosis is supposed to be a disease of modern civilisation,’ Dr Adel Allam, a nuclear cardiologist at Cairo’s Al Azhar University told Alan Mozes of Health Day. He believes that heart disease risk is not just about poor diet and obesity, but that genetics may also come into play. Last year, CT scans of 137 mummies showed evidence of atherosclerosis, or hardened arteries, in one third of those examined - including those from ancient people believed to have healthy lifestyles. 'Heart disease has been stalking mankind for over 4,000 years all over the globe,' said Dr Randall Thompson, a cardiologist at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City. 'I think it's fair to say people should feel less guilty about getting heart disease in modern times. We may have oversold the idea that a healthy lifestyle can completely eliminate your risk. Dr Thomas said ‘There is a surprising similarity in the amount and distribution of atherosclerotic calcifications, fatty deposits, between ancient Egyptians and current Americans of a similar age. ‘This is observed, even though many of what we believe to be major risk factors must be different between the two populations. ‘There was no tobacco in ancient Egypt. Ancient Egyptians must have been more active than current Americans, and some of the dietary issues that exist in the USA today did not exist in ancient Egypt.’ Instead researchers believe the disease could have been caused by chronic inflammation triggered by repeated infections due to poor hygiene, lack of sanitation and living in close proximity to animals. For example, the mummy ‘Nakht,’ a teenage boy who worked as a weaver circa 1,200 BC in Thebes was infected with four parasites including tapeworm and malaria, while others had TB. Dr Thomas said ‘These ancient people were unaware of the germs lurking in the unhygienic environments in which they lived, animals and people living side by side, inadequate sewage, contaminated water. ‘They did not know that the germs amongst which they lived caused infection after infection. ‘In . addition to frequent bacterial and viral infections, the ancients likely . suffered from lifelong parasitic infestations. Modern medicine, . knowledge and antibiotics had not yet arrived.’ The . inflammatory process, which cells use to fight infection, has been . proven to speed up the inflammation that happens when cholesterol gets . into the wall of the artery, which leads to further build-up of fatty . deposits. The disease was also more common in . women, who would have been repeatedly exposed to the smoke from cooking . fires, which the scientists believe had the same effect on the arteries . as smoke from cigarettes. Only the ancient Egyptians were wealthy enough to have enjoyed the fat-laden diet and sedentary lifestyle commonly associated with the disease. Yet atherosclerosis was discovered in common people from the other four cultures. A previous study shows a mummy from 200-900 AD of a Peruvian woman in her 40s, excavated from Lima, with calcifications in the arteries . Researchers behind a series of studies published in Global Heart, the journal of the World Heart Federation, call for a fresh look at risk factors not associated with rich living. Dr Thomas said ‘Each year we learn more and more about the impact of the human genome and molecules in our blood, and so to believe we have already uncovered all the causes, or risk factors, of atherosclerosis may be wishful thinking. ‘Using the past to predict the future, as these ancient people unexpectedly had atherosclerosis, we need to continue to search for other potential fundamental causes of atherosclerosis. ‘The discovery of new causes could dramatically reshape the frequency and impact of atherosclerosis today. ‘This should lead to re-evaluation of the root causes of atherosclerosis, and may lead to entirely new avenues of prevention and early treatment.’","A medical expert at Long Beach Memorial California said discovery of heart disease in Ancient Egyptians hints a modern fatty diet isn't solely to blame .

"The Fuhrer is believed to have taken crystal meth before a meeting with Mussolini in the summer of 1943, when he ranted non-stop for two hours . Adolf Hitler was a regular user of crystal meth – one of the most feared and addictive illegal substances on today’s black market and the drug at the heart of the hit TV series Breaking Bad – research has shown. A 47-page wartime dossier compiled by American Military Intelligence reveals that Hitler, a notorious hypochondriac, took an astonishing 74 different medications including crystal methamphetamines. Manufactured by the fictional teacher-turned-drug dealer Walter White in Breaking Bad, the drug is prized by addicts for the feelings of euphoria it produces. But it was also valued by the military during the war as a drug which could help combat the effects of fatigue. The Fuhrer is believed to have taken crystal meth before a meeting with Mussolini in the summer of 1943, when he ranted non-stop for two hours. And he had nine injections of a drug called Vitamultin, which contained meth-amphetamine, during his final days in his bunker. The dossier also debunks one of the most enduring legends about the Fuhrer – the claim that he lost a testicle when he was injured at the Battle of the Somme. Morale-boosting ditty ‘Hitler has only got one ball’ was popular during the Second World War and his admirer Unity Mitford suggested he ‘lacked something in the manly department’. But the American records, which feature in a Channel 4 documentary, show the dictator was not monorchid (the medical term for being born with one testicle). They also shoot down claims that Hitler was a predatory homosexual who massacred 150 supporters to hide his secret. An entry written in November 1945, based on the Fuhrer’s medical records and interviews with doctors who treated him, including his physician Dr Theodor Morell, states: ‘He was neither a pervert nor a homosexual. His sexual organs showed no indication of abnormality.’ Manufactured by the fictional teacher-turned-drug dealer Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston, right) in Breaking Bad, the drug is prized by addicts for the feelings of euphoria it produces . Hitler fell under the spell of Dr Morell, who ran a clinic in Berlin, in 1936. He gave him medication called Mutaflor to cure stomach cramps, and Hitler became a devotee. Morell then prescribed the barbiturate Brom-Nervacit, the morphine-based drug Eukodal, bulls’ semen, to give him a testosterone boost, and Pervitin, a pill containing crystal meth. The Fuhrer (right)  is believed to have taken crystal meth before a meeting with Mussolini (left) in the summer of 1943 . Morell also gave him two artificial stimulants, Coramine and Cardiazol. To counteract the effect of the stimulants, Morell gave Hitler more sedatives. By the end of 1943, the Fuhrer was dependent on a destructive mix of uppers and downers. Bill Panagopoulos, an American collector who discovered the dossier, said: ‘Morell was a quack and a fraud and a snake oil salesman. ‘He should not have been practising medicine anywhere outside a veterinary clinic.’ He added: ‘Some [of the drugs] were innocuous, some not so innocuous, some poisonous. Did he develop a dependence on any of these drugs? Which of these drugs, if any, were addictive? And did he become addicted to them? I’d be interested to know what the combination of these medications would do to someone who’s otherwise in good health.’","A 47-page dossier compiled by American Military Intelligence claims Hitler took 74 different medications including crystal meth-amphetamines .

"She was violently stripped naked and beaten senseless by a mob of women on a busy shopping street ... but the police never came.

"Britons fighting for the so-called Islamic State insurgency in Iraq and Syria have called on fanatics in the UK to launch a campaign of assassination against key figures, it was claimed today. Messages posted on the micro-blogging site Twitter are said to be offering addresses of VIP targets in the UK to potential jihadists still living in this country. It comes as a law student accused of targeting former Labour prime minister Tony Blair faces a retrial after a jury was discharged in Britain's first secret terror trial. VIP hitlist: Junaid Hussein, 20, from Birmingham, who was jailed in 2012 for hacking Tony Blair's office computer and has since become a prominent Islamic State tweeter, is said to be one of those urging attacks . The Sun claims an investigation has revealed Britons in Syria have a hitlist of prominent 'non-believers' whose names and addresses are on offer to extremists. Junaid Hussein, 20, from Birmingham, is said to be one of those urging attacks. He was previously jailed for six months in 2012 for hacking Blair's office computer, then publishing the former PM's adress and National Insurance number on the Internet. Now he is thought to be among a group of Britons dubbed The Beatles believed to be responsible for beheading five Westerners in propaganda videos. The Sun claims Hussein, who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Hussain Al Britani, reposted a message from another Briton, known as Abu Dujana, last Friday calling for people to 'do something' to prominent non-believers. The message, which MailOnline was unable to independently verify, was said to read: 'Whoo wants 2 do something 2 some top kaffirss, we gt addresses 4 u.' Extremist: Hussein is said to be in the  group of Britons known as The Beatles, including the so-called Jihadi John, left, who have executed five Western hostages.

It comes as police blunders enabled one of hate preacher Anjem Choudary’s top henchmen to skip bail and flee to Syria with his family. Siddhartha Dhar, 31, disappeared less than 24 hours after being freed on police bail by Scotland Yard detectives investigating Choudary’s inner circle. Dhar, a darling of TV interviewers repeatedly given a platform on the BBC to promote his radical views, had publicly stated that he wanted to live under the Islamic State. In a separate case, this week a jury was discharged in the secret trial of suspected Islamic extremist Erol Incedal, 26, who is accused of planning to murder Blair.

"A Dorset family has claimed they were refused a refund on tickets they did not use because of a bereavement. Tony Broom, 39, said he was left almost £400 out of pocket for not using flights he had purchased to see his wife Justinya's father in Poland, after he passed away before their scheduled trip. The family of three had been due to visit the grandfather during the October half-term holidays, but he lost his battle with cancer in August. According to Ryanair policy, flights can be refunded if a bereavement happens within 28 days of the intended travel date. However, because this was not the case, the family were refused the refund for two months, until they made their quarrel public. Uncompassionate: Ryanair have angered a family for refusing to refund tickets following a family death . Engineer Tony, 39, told MailOnline Travel that the family had been due to visit his father-in-law in October and paid £398 for five tickets, which included parking at Stansted airport. Upon learning of his father-in-law's death on August 30, Tony, who did not have travel insurance, attempted to change the  flights to travel to Poland for the September 2 funeral. He claims he was advised to apply for a refund separately and  buy new tickets for the flights to Poland for the funeral. 'I explained that the [October] tickets were of little use to us now,' Broom said. 'I called and spoke to a Ryanair rep, and he told me the lowest quote for five seats for myself, my wife and our three children would be £1,280,' he said. The family opted to drive instead. Ryanair refute Mr Broom's claims, stating that the airline has no record of such a phone call. The airline tells MailOnline Travel that the cost of changing the flight would amount to £70 per person each way - £700 overall for a family of five. Tony Broom was unhappy with the airline's service following the death of his wife Justinya's father . Within days of returning from the funeral, Tony contacted the airline to apply for a refund, providing his father-in-law's death certificate as evidence of the bereavement, but in their response Ryanair directed him to their terms and conditions, which state that only deaths occurring within 28 days allow passengers a refund on tickets. After three attempts to argue the case with the airline over the past two months, Mr Broom eventually got in touch with Bournemouth Echo, after which Ryanair offered £340 of travel credit - covering their original fares but not the airport parking, which is handled by a different company. 'I don't really want to fly with them again personally, after all the agro I've had to go through to get the credit' Broome said. 'I'm pleased they've offered something, but only after the intervention of the press.' The airline's terms and conditions state that they will provide a full refund if a passenger has lost an immediate family member within 28 days of intended travel. The policy covers spouses, civil partners, children, siblings, parents, grandparents, grandchildren, parents-in-law and children-in-law. Airline website states: . 'Should you be affected by a bereavement of an immediate member of your family within 28 days of your intended date of travel and you do not wish to travel, Ryanair will provide a full refund upon application.' The website states: 'Should you be affected by a bereavement of an immediate member of your family within 28 days of your intended date of travel and you do not wish to travel, Ryanair will provide a full refund upon application.' 'They would have had six weeks to refill those seats but they chose not to,' Mr Broom said. 'It doesn't seem very compassionate - it doesn't seem right to me.' A spokesperson for Ryanair told MailOnline Travel: 'As stated in our terms and conditions of travel, customers who are affected by a bereavement of an immediate family member within 28 days of their intended date of travel will be provided with a full refund upon application. 'We convey our sincere condolences to Mr Broom and his family and as a gesture of goodwill, have resolved this matter directly with the customer.'","Family were to visit grandfather in Poland in October but he died in August .

"CLICK HERE to see Harry Redknapp's  Premier League team from the modern era. For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read. In Redknapp’s new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' - serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - the QPR manager picks his two all-time greatest Premier League teams from the early years to the present day. From Alan Shearer to Ryan Giggs, the 67-year-old reveals his one to 11 titans of the early Premier League era. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira disagreeing over old battles . My best team for this period includes possibly the most controversial selection of my whole book: Matt Le Tissier instead of David Beckham. I know some people will think I’ve gone mad. But David was a fantastic player in a fantastic team, whereas Matt was performing heroics that built a football club. Without him, Southampton couldn’t have stayed in the top division for so long, and without that they would not have been able to build their new stadium and its fabulous academy that saw players like Gareth Bale and Theo Walcott come through the ranks. Sportsmail can exclusively reveal Harry Redknapp's greatest Premier League XI from the early era . Le Tissier’s 10 greatest goals would stand alongside those by Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo -even Diego Maradona or Pele. He was a one-man band there for a lot of the time, like Sir Tom Finney had been at Preston. People would ask ‘Why isn’t he playing for Manchester United then?’ He was just happy to be at a club he had known since he was 16, happy to be 30 minutes away from his family in the Channel Islands. I think he would have been brilliant at a club like Arsenal, but just because he didn’t make that jump doesn’t mean he’s not smart. Matt Le Tissier scores against Manchester United in 1996 as David Beckham (right) looks on . Le Tissier (left) scores a spectacular volley for Southampton against Wimbledon in 1994 . David Beckham with Le Tissier in 1999 - the former Manchester United star misses out on Redknapp's XI . Patrick Vieira was a different type of midfield player and one every club would like to take now. He almost came to me at Tottenham from Inter Milan. I thought it was an incredible decision by him, after he’d been such a hero at Arsenal. I met him at his house in Hampstead and he had no fear about what people would think or what reception he would get. He had enough confidence in his ability to just brush it away. I remember talking to Daniel Levy, our chairman, about him. He said the crowd would be hostile. I knew that - but if he had enough bottle to want to put on our white shirt after all that had gone before, I thought it said something about the man. Patrick Vieira drives past Luis Boa Morte in 2001 - the Arsenal star was the ultimate box-to-box midfielder . Vieira and his great rival Roy Keane clash during a match at Highbury in 1999 - it wouldn't be the last time . In the end, his circumstances changed and he decided to stay in Italy. By the time he did become available - the following January - our needs had changed and Manchester City snapped him up. Patrick is the player Arsenal have never really replaced, but I still find it bizarre that he ended up in a blazer at Manchester City. Shouldn’t he be at Arsenal? It is ironic that so many associate Arsene Wenger with the beautiful game, yet his Arsenal teams, with Vieira - the ultimate box-to-box midfielder - did as much as anybody to introduce real physical power into the modern Premier League. Tony Adams: A leader of men at 16 . I first saw him aged 16 and I don’t think I have ever seen a player of that age bossing a game in that way. It stayed with me for a long time. Tony was such an influence that he as good as ran every dressing-room he played in, for England and Arsenal. Tony Adams was a brilliant and inspirational captain who led from the front for Arsenal, says Redknapp . Redknapp saw Adams play as a 16-year-old and said he bossed the game at an extremely young age . Adams (left) clears the ball away during an international for England against Norway at Wembley in 1992 . Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing . Wenger heralded a change in English football... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports . Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent . Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while working on TV! Why Redknapp fears that the English manager is in danger of becoming extinct . Vieira nearly crossed North London to join Spurs... and  Suarez was close to signing too . Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that! Sportsmail's Head of Sport Lee Clayton interviews Redknapp about his new book . Stuart Pearce: Search-and-destroy 'Psycho' My West Ham chairman wouldn’t let me buy him, aged 34, because he said he was too old. I eventually got him at 37, he played 50 games in two seasons and was voted Hammer of the Year. He was on a search-and-destroy mission in every game. The first time the ball came to you he was going to smash you, run all over you, chip you into the stand and then take the ball, run forward and shoot. Then he’d get back just as fast as he got up. He was a dream left-back. Stuart Pearce, nicknamed 'Psycho' and seen screaming during Euro 96, was the 'perfect left back' Redknapp (left) eventually signed Pearce at West Ham United as a 37-year-old having courted him for years . The left back, here playing for Newcastle United against Everton in 1998, was good in attack and defence . Roy Keane: The pussycat . Do you know why it took so long for Roy Keane to get his break as a kid? He was a bit timid. Unbelievable isn’t it? But those were the words of our Irish scout, and he knew him inside out. He was a right-winger at the time, and they thought he was a bit soft. It is amazing how people change. Roy Keane (right) was not picked up by Redknapp's Irish scout because he was deemed to be a 'bit timid' Keane forged a wonderful career with Manchester United, including captaining them against Juventus . Keane takes a swing at old foe Alan Shearer during a United defeat at Newcastle in 2001 . The former Ireland midfielder (right) competes for the ball during a match for Nottingham Forest in 1992 .

"When it comes to moving your life abroad, expats should head to Switzerland if they want to improve on their quality of life. But it's best not to move to the UK or US, both of which ranked near the bottom of the best places in the world for expats to live. Switzerland, Singapore, China and Germany were voted the best places in the world for what they offer expats, while Egypt was rated the worst place to live abroad in the HSBC expat survey. Switzerland was ranked as number one by expats looking for a well-balanced, high quality lifestyle, according to the seventh Expat Survey. And Singapore, China, Germany and Bahrain followed in the rankings in the report commissioned by HSBC Expat. But the UK and the US ranked in 33rd and 30th place out of 34 for quality of life for expats, with the UK just one spot above the bottom country, Egypt. The Expat Explorer survey, conducted by YouGov, is one of the largest global surveys of expats. This year, nearly 9,300 expats from around the world shared their views on quality of life, financial wellbeing and the ease of raising a family abroad. But while Switzerland topped the pile of 34 countries who fulfilled the sufficient criteria to complete the survey. While life in the UK offers expats careers, property and, interestingly, the potential to ﬁnd a partner, it was not enough to prevent it languishing in penultimate place on the list. Expats are most likely to head to the United Kingdom in pursuit of better job prospects (31 per cent) or to be with family and partners (31 per cent), but this year's survey reveals that expats there are also among the most likely to fall in love in their new country. Half of expats (50 per cent) there say that they have found a life partner since moving – second only to Italy (57 per cent) and higher than the global average of 36 per cent. There is one country worse off than the UK however, Egypt, which is perhaps hardly surprising considering the civil fighting going on there over the last few years. In data obtained by MailOnline, New Zealand ranks on top as the country where the highest number of expats are likely to remain in the country with an incredible 90 per cent. The UK fares somewhat better, with 72 per cent of expats living here likely to remain on these shores. Dean Blackburn, head of HSBC Expat, said: 'There are a great many decisions involved in making the move abroad, ranging from consideration of finances and managing money, right through to integrating into the local community and arranging childcare. 'While Asia continues to excel as a region for those looking for higher salaries, the Middle East draws career minded expats and New Zealand offers a great opportunity for those looking for quality of life and a good place to raise a family. 'This year's Expat Explorer league table shows that there are many countries that offer a good balance, providing expats with a rewarding and exciting experience.' From a financial wellbeing perspective, Switzerland emerges as a destination to advance career prospects and receive a healthy salary while also maintaining a good work / life balance. One quarter (25 per cent) of expats in Switzerland earn more than USD200,000 p.a., yet over half (51 per cent) report a better work / life balance since moving. Expats in Switzerland also have a lot of confidence in the local economy, with almost half (47 per cent) saying they are very satisfied with the state of the local economy – the highest proportion for any country included in this year’s survey. Switzerland topped the pile of the best quality of life for expats - perhaps it's not hard to see why . Expats in Italy - the country was ranked in 31st position out of 34 for overall standard of living . Many expats in Switzerland comment on the country’s high quality of air and pleasant surroundings, with three quarters (75 per cent) agreeing that this is an improvement on their home country. Expat parents also report that Switzerland offers benefits for families too, believing their offspring are now safer (81 per cent), enjoy a better quality of life (77 per cent) and receive a better education (65 per cent). Asia: a hotspot for high earning expats . Asia emerges from this year’s survey as the best region for financial wellbeing, with nearly one fifth (19 per cent) of expats earning over USD200,000 p.a. and 65 per cent saying they have more disposable income since relocating. China is home to the largest proportion of high-earning expats in the world – nearly two-fifths (38 per cent) earn over USD200,000 p.a and over three quarters (76 per cent) have more disposable income than they did at home. Elsewhere in Asia, around a quarter of expats in India (24 per cent) and Hong Kong (23 per cent) earn over the USD200,000 p.a. mark, with 56 per cent and 63 per cent respectively saying they have greater disposable income than before. The Middle East attracts career-minded expats . Nearly three-quarters (74 per cent) of expats in the Middle East report that they are satisfied with their host country’s current economic outlook - the highest of all regions in this year’s survey. Countries in the Middle East continue to attract career-minded expats seeking to boost their earning potential, with nearly six in ten (56 per cent) expats who move to the Middle East doing so for better job prospects and over a third (35 per cent) moving to increase their income levels. But it’s not all hard work – the survey reveals that the majority of expats in Bahrain enjoy a better work / life balance (62 per cent) and more enjoyable commute into work (68 per cent), in comparison to their home countries. New Zealand: the winner for expat experience and family life . Expats this year voted New Zealand as the best destination for expat life experience and raising a family abroad. The country ranks as the easiest place for expats to set up a new life, making it a popular option for expats young and old to enjoy a high quality lifestyle. New Zealand is the destination where expats are most likely to move in order to improve their standard of living (54 per cent), as well as benefiting from the pleasant climate and picturesque scenery (89 per cent), friendly local people (75 per cent) and a good work / life balance (71 per cent). Expat parents living in New Zealand also commented on the improved health and wellbeing (78 per cent) and safety of their children (87 per cent), as well as saying they are bringing up more confident and well-rounded individuals (58 per cent) since moving.","Switzerland top of the pile for a high quality of life for expats .

"Dilapidated, muddy and squalid though it was, it was all they had to call home - a shantytown in the heart of Silicon Valley. Today signaled the end for more than 300 former residents of the homeless emcampment known as the 'The Jungle' in San Jose, California - likely the largest in the country - who have been forced out of their makeshift abodes and underground homes. The run-down tents and piles of trash are in stark contrast to the opulence of its Silicon Valley surroundings, home to tech giants Google, Apple and Facebook, and its dismantling has stirred up controversy. And with many having nowhere else to go, charities say the evacuated residents will simply set up their camp elsewhere. San Jose's homelessness response manager Ray Bramson said increased violence, wet weather and unsanitary conditions make it imperative the camp be cleared. In the last month, one resident tried to strangle another with a cord of wire and another was nearly beaten to death with a hammer, he said. Homeless: More than 300 residents of the Silicon Valley shantytown known as 'The Jungle' have been given notices to leave the area by December 4. Grace Hilliard, pictured, stands outside her tent yesterday . Homeless: An unidentified woman walks along a muddy path at the Silicon Valley homeless encampment in San Jose, California . Earlier this week, police officers and city officials invaded the one square-mile camp - taping notices on tents and tree trunks informing the people who live there to clear out by today or face arrest for trespassing. A walk-through later found only 60 people left and the rest have been forced out today, with no reports of violence or residents refusing to leave. Jennifer Loving, executive director of Destination Home, who has been working to house homeless people in the area, warned residents they had to get out when she toured the camp last week - even though there was 'nowhere for them to go'. 'We don't have the housing. We can't magically create it.' 'There's nowhere for them to go,' she added. But Scott Wagers, a pastor who runs a support organization for the homeless, said the forced evacuation of what he described as 'a crime syndicate ruled by gangs, where the police do not enter', will lead the evicted to restore their camp elsewhere. He explained 'The Jungle' was developed two years after the evacuation of another slum in San Jose. He believes San Jose should give land for 'camping legally' and larger neighbors technology groups, including Apple, should donate in order 'to solve the problem for good. ' The city has one of the highest numbers of homeless people in the country and more than 5,000 sleep on the streets, in parks and under freeways in the area. Makeshift: City officials plan to send in trash trucks and bulldozers to flatten homes and prevent homeless from re-entering the camp . Empty: A shirt with a morale-boosting message is placed  atop mud and debris at the Silicon Valley homeless encampment . A spokesman for the city of San Jose, David Vossbrink, said an 'urgent' evacuation was necessary, citing sanitation and safety concerns. When the camp is cleared out, a team will go through the hand-built structures and tents looking for cash, IDs or anything else of value. Those items will be sorted and stored for people to claim later. Then city officials plan to send in trash trucks and bulldozers to flatten homes and haul out tons of hazardous and human waste. Using heavy machinery, excavated sections where people have been living underground will be filled in by Christmas - leaving no sign of 'The Jungle' as it is now. In the past year and a half, the city of San Jose has spent more than $4 million on solving the problems at the encampment and the cleanout was in May 2012 when about 150 people were moved out of The Jungle. Mr Vossbrink attributed the homeless problem to several factors, including the financial crisis of 2008, during which many people 'lost their jobs or their homes,' and the technology boom in Silicon Valley, where rents are exorbitant and low-skilled jobs become scarce. He added that 140 people from the camp have been housed in 'apartments, hotels, homes,' and another 60 had received 'good' financial assistance for housing on their own.

He said: 'We started to relocate for 18 months some of the homeless and intend to begin dismantling Thursday. 'This work is expected to last two or three weeks and will be accompanied by laying fences to prevent the homeless to relocate.'

"And then there were two. For Steven Gerrard, that is. If the Liverpool captain is to mark his long goodbye with a trophy it will have to be in the FA Cup or the Europa League. Chelsea move on to Wembley in the Capital One Cup final and their supporters did not miss the chance to remind him that another chance had passed him by. Gerrard did not linger on the pitch at Stamford Bridge. He applauded the away fans in the Shed End and disappeared down the tunnel, leaving the home team to savour their victory. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (right) shakes hands with Chelsea centre back John Terry at full-time . Over the two legs, Liverpool could be satisfied with their performance. While clearly lacking a finisher - a potent threat in front of goal to give purpose to their pleasing approach play - they pushed Chelsea into extra-time which in itself amounts to a sign of recovery after a dreadful few months. Brendan Rodgers has hauled this team up from their knees, from the November low in the capital when they were beaten at Crystal Palace, a fourth successive defeat. That day at Selhurst Park, a dejected Liverpool boss confessed his job was not safe, but he and his team have responded, even if they were not able to stop the slide out of the Champions League. This was only their second defeat in 17 since Palace. More importantly, Rodgers has seen his team recapture some of the zest and intensity which was a trademark of last season. Gerrard and Chelsea striker Diego Costa get up, close and personal during the tense clash at Stamford Bridge . Gerrard and Costa both receive yellow cards from referee Michael Oliver for their altercation . Over two legs, they have genuinely troubled Chelsea, the team which won at Anfield in April and sparked their collapse in the title race. Rodgers has tweaked his formation, finally realising that the system designed to get the most from Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge was of limited use with Suarez in Barcelona and Sturridge injured. The tempo is up, thanks in part to the energy of Raheem Sterling who appears refreshed after his Caribbean break. Perhaps Gerrard’s decision to confirm his plans to leave for Los Angeles at the end of the season has done everyone a favour, too. The talisman is on his way and it is time for others to stand up and seize the chance to succeed him as the team’s spiritual leader. Philippe Coutinho (centre) caused Chelsea plenty of problems over the two legs of the semi-final . At the same time, Rodgers has been able to use him more sparingly, give him the rest he needs and squeeze more from him in the most important fixtures, like this one. Gerrard was influential at Stamford Bridge, especially in the first-half, when Liverpool were at their most fluent in attack caused Chelsea problems. His passing brought the wing-backs into the game and took advantage of the holes appearing in Chelsea’s defensive unit. Jose Mourinho, for all his defensive acumen and attention to detail, has not found it easy to quash the threats of Sterling and Philippe Coutinho over the two legs of this semi-final. Were it not for Thibaut Courtois, who made first-half saves which bought Chelsea the time to adjust and fight their way back into the game last night, it might have been different. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli (centre) entered the fray with 20 minutes but once again proved ineffective . Moreover, if Liverpool had a striker it might have been different. They might have won this second leg by half-time with a deadly finisher in the team like, for example, Suarez. Or even with Sturridge, who is still not quite fit, which seems to have been his operational status for quite a while. Mario Balotelli was again not the answer. Coming off the bench with 20 minutes of normal time remaining, he was unable to contribute anything useful, smashing one sharp chance high into the Matthew Harding Stand and curling an ambitious effort over from a tight angle when he would have been better off passing the ball. Sterling, despite scoring the goal in the first leg, does not yet have the composure to offer a reliable source of goals – and there was to be no heroic rescue act from Gerrard. Perhaps he will save that for one of the other competitions.","Chelsea move on to Wembley in the Capital One Cup final .

"American citizens and embassies could be at risk of attacks if the US Senate releases a lengthy intelligence report on CIA interrogation techniques. The warning comes from the National Intelligence Council, which is pressuring the White House to keep the report under wraps to avoid inflaming anti-US passions abroad, lest more violence breaks out throughout the Middle East, reported Yahoo News. 'It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out if you release a report like this at a time when terrorism is surging all over the Mideast you are handing the other side a recruitment tool,' ex-CIA Director John McLaughlin told the news outlet. 'It’s blindingly obvious.' People who . have read the full report say it shows that the CIA interrogation . program was far more brutal than previously understood, and that agency officials repeatedly misled Congress and the Justice Department about . what was being done to al-Qaida detainees. US intelligence officials warn that the report could inspire violent protests, such as it happened after the release of photographs showing abusive treatment of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison (pictured) Violent protests broke out across the Mideast when photos surfaced showing prisoner mistreatment at the Abu Ghraib prison, such as the one seen here . Sen. Dianne . Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been . locked in battle with the Obama Administration over the release of a . summary outlining the practices. Intelligence . officials handed Feinstein an executive summary, or about 480 pages of . the 6,300-page report, but the senator complained that the . highly-redacted excerpts 'obscure key facts that support the report’s . findings and conclusions.' 'Until . these redactions are addressed to the committee’s satisfaction, the . report will not be made public,' Feinstein vowed in a letter to the . president. Director . of National Intelligence James Clapper says about 85 percent of the . report on the 'detention and interrogation' program is declassified. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, is demanding that the Obama Administration release more information regarding the CIA's interrogation techniques . Of . the rest of the material, about half of the redacted material is . footnotes, mostly done to protect classified information that could harm . ongoing operations or active agents, he said. But for some, even that kind of information can be inflammatory. President Obama put a halt to the CIA's advanced interrogation program. Advocacy groups say the Senate's report could be the last chance for public accountability on the matter . 'The . Mideast is a tinderbox right now and this could be the spark that . ignites quite a fire,' one intelligence official told Yahoo News. 'This will be an ugly story when it comes out,' added another source to the news website. The 6,300-page report, along with a CIA rebuttal, represents the most detailed accounting to date of a set of bitterly controversial interrogation, rendition and detention practices the CIA carried out in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks — practices many Americans now consider to have been immoral or illegal. President Barack Obama stopped the practices when he took office, but he decided against a 'truth commission' to examine what happened. Criminal investigations conducted in secret resulted on no charges. Activists rally in front of the White House in 2013 to demand President Obama close down the Guantanamo Bay prison, where US prisoners were allegedly tortured . Advocacy groups say the Senate's summary could be the last chance for public accountability on the matter. It's long been known that the CIA used slapping, stress positions, sleep deprivation and other harsh tactics on several detainees and a near-drowning technique known as water boarding on three of them. The CIA's use of water boarding has drawn particular scrutiny since it is considered the harshest technique on the list of those used. The report asserts that the other tactics, as applied, were just as harsh and extremely brutal — though no unique, life-saving information was gleaned from applying the methods. Torture is illegal under U.S. law. CIA officials still dispute whether water boarding amounted to torture.","National Intelligence Council pressures White House against the release of information on CIA interrogation techniques .

"An extremist preacher who is said to have played role in radicalising the murderers of soldier Lee Rigby has attempted to justify the killing of those fighting jihadis in Syria and Iraq. Omar Bakri Muhammad, who was known as the Tottenham Ayatollah, has been openly using Facebook to say that it is sometimes necessary to kill women and children sheltering in schools and hospitals. Bakri, who is banned from Britain and is facing terrorism charges in Lebanon, has been blamed for radicalising several young extremists, including the killers of Lee Rigby, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. Chilling: Omar Bakri Muhammad has been openly using Facebook to say that it is sometimes necessary to kill women and children sheltering in schools and hospitals . His posts on the social media site come just days after several websites were criticised for not raising the alarm about extreme messages posted by one of the killers of Fusilier Rigby in the six months before his death. On his account, which has now been deleted from Facebook, he the made a post under the title 'killing women and children'. According to the Sunday Telegraph, he wrote that even though this was not usually permitted, he added: 'One must distinguish between killing women and children and the Mujahideen fighting the Kuffar (non-believers) wherever they find them, whether that be in a school or hospital or elsewhere.' Omar Bakri Muhammad (centre) was known as the Tottenham Ayatollah when he lived in Britain . Murderers: Omar Bakri Muhammad has been blamed for radicalising several young extremists, including the killers of Lee Rigby, Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) He also added that the Mujahideen must kill people who do not believe in the extreme version of Islam, 'wherever they find them'. A Facebook spokesman told the newspaper they don't comment on individual cases but added they do not permit terrorist material on their site. Bakri, believed to be 54 now, was previously the London-based spiritual leader of the extremist group Al-Muhajiroun. The messages come just days after Facebook was criticised for not raising the alarm about messages posted by one of Fusilier Rigby's (pictured) killers . He previously live in London and was under investigation by UK police after he called for young British Muslims to take up arms and join Al Qaeda. On the London bombings it was also reported that Bakri referred to the four suicide bombers who killed 56 people on July 7 as 'the fantastic four'. He said the British people were to blame for the terror attacks on the capital because they 'did not make enough effort to stop its own government committing its own atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan'. In March he told The Daily Mail when speaking of the troubles in Tripoli ‘only jihad salafi can save it and save Lebanon’. He added: ‘This country needs to be made an Islamic state, obviously ... but I know the security services are getting ready to nab me soon’. The radical Islamic cleric was under house arrest in Tripoli since Lebanese security forces released him from jail in 2010, after striking a deal with the Shia extremist group Hezbollah. Bakri was sentenced to life following a terrorism conviction, but was released on bail after witnesses recanted their testimony.","Omar Bakri Muhammad used Facebook to speak out against ISIS' enemies .

"Lawyers for accused terrorist Omarjan Azari say there is a 'glaring error' in the translation of a phone call at the centre of the police evidence against the 22-year-old apprentice mechanic. Prominent Sydney barrister Winston Terracini SC also said Azari - who is being held in Australia's toughest jail, Supermax in Goulburn - is being kept apart from his family who are not allowed to visit. Azarai, a former soccer fanatic and Parramatta High School student who grew up in Sydney's western suburbs, was arrested on September 17 at his parents' home in Guildford in what was one of dozens of raids by hundreds of police on homes in Sydney and Brisbane in the nation's largest counter-terrorism operation. According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days before the raids between Omarjan Azari and former Sydney nightclub bouncer, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Prosecution screw up: Prominent Sydney barrister, Winston Terracini SC, (pictured outside a Sydney court today) told the court that a phone call at the centre of the case against accused terrorist. Omarjan Azari, had a 'glaring error' in its translation from Arabic to English. He also said authorities had conspired to deny Azari any prison visits by his family . Deep inside Supremax: Ormarjan Azari (pictured on his way to prison following his arrest on at his parents' house on September 18) is being held in the High Risk Management Correctional Centre - Australia's most secure jail - under its strictest inmate classification . Azari, who has grown his beard in jail, occasionally touched his face and wriggled in his chair during the appearance almost two months after his arrest during a series of terror raids (pictured) across Sydney . According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days ago between Omarjan Azari and former Sydney nightclub bouncer, Mohammad Ali Baryalei (pictured) during a five month period when counter terrorist police had Aazri under surveillance. Baryalei is rumoured to have since been killed in Syria . Mr Terracini told Central Local Court magistrate Greg Grogin that he had already had an Arabic speaker listen to the phone call in which prosecutors allege Azari made the threat to behead a person in Sydney's Martin Place. 'There is at least one glaring error which goes to the crux of whether this young man is involved in a terrorist act,' Mr Terracini said of the prosecution's translation of the phone call. Mr Terracini said despite the Commonwealth DPP serving many documents in its brief of evidence against Azari, 'only one piece of evidence is relevant'. 'It seems to be the fact there is only one telephone call ... and there are inaccuracies in the translation.' Around 12 homes were searched on September 17 in Sydney’s northwest suburbs by NSW Police and Australian Federal Police (AFP). Azari, who has grown his beard in jail, sat in the Supermax High Risk Management prison video room occasionally touching his face and wriggling in his chair as his case was heard in court. He spoke only twice, softly answering 'yes' when Magistrate Grogin asked him questions. Mr Terracini said Azari, who will apply for bail on December 19, had been prevented from seeing his family by Corrective Services and prosecutors conspiring in a 'secret' agreement to ban 'visitors of any kind ... family, his parents who have no criminal convictions, his sister who has no conviction'. Commonwealth prosecutor Karen Leavy told the court her office had 'no influence' over inmate classification. Leading Sydney silk: Winston Terracini SC (right) and solicitor Ben Archbold (left) are pictured leaving Central Local Court on Thursday following their appearance before Magistrtae Greg Grogin on behalf of Omarjan Azari, the 22-year-old apprentice motor mechanic who police allege was planning to behead a member of the public . Prominent Sydney barrister Winston Terracini also said Azari - who is being held in Australia's toughest jail, Supermax in Goulburn - is being kept apart from his family who are not allowed to visit . Police confiscated a sword (above, left) and materials from the cars of suspects (above, right) during the September 18 raids across NSW and Queensland in the nation's biggest counter terrorism offensive . Azari spoke only twice in court, giving a quiet 'yes' when addressed by Magistrate Grogin. Mr Terracini said Azari's defence team was not interested in the 180 or more documents gathered by the Commonwealth DPP and that the telephone allegedly used in the call from which the terrorism charge arose did not belong to the accused. 'We are interested in the phone used allegedly by this man which the prosecution knows was not his,' Mr Terracini said. Azari is accused of conspiring with Baryalei 'and others' in planning a terrorist act between 12.01am on March 8 this year and 4.30am on September 18, the time and date of his arrest. Azari was arrested the day after his parents left Australia to fly to Saudi Arabia for the religious holiday, the Hajj. Around 12 homes, including the house (pictured) where Omarjan Azari had been living with his parents, brothers and sister, were searched in Sydney’s northwest suburbs by NSW  and Australian Federal Police . The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack, which the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP)said was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'. CDPP prosecutor Michael Allnutt told Central Local Court during Omarjan Azari's last appearance that he had had made a threat during a phone call a few days prior to the raid which involved a 'random selection of persons to execute'. Azari had displayed 'an unusual level of fanaticism' in the call, which was intercepted by police, Mr Allnutt said. Court documents suggest their plotting began on May 8, and the court heard Azari knew he was under police surveillance. Since Azari's last court appearance, unconfirmed reports say that Mohammad Ali Baryalei has been killed in Syria. Since Azari's last court appearance, following which heavily armed police (pictyred) escorted him from Central Local Court down to the Goulburn Supermax Jail, unconfirmed reports say that Mohammad Ali Baryalei has been killed in Syria . Court documents suggest the plotting for a public beheading between Omarjan Azarai, Baryalei 'and others' began on May 8, and the court heard Azari knew he was under police surveillance . Daily Mail Australia believes Azari is being held in Supermax under NSW prisons highest security classification, which means he would not be allowed to hold telephone conversations in any language but English. Even his visits from his legal team have been in the metal lined legal boxes inside Supermax. Ms Leavy said federal prosecutors were assembling material including voice recognition identification and further telephone material from the Attorney General's department.

"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blames the U.S. and 'wicked' British for creating the Islamic State group which has seized control of a swathe of Iraq and Syria . Iran's supreme leader has blamed the U.S. and 'wicked' British for creating the Islamic State terror group which has seized control of a swathe of Iraq and Syria. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's sharp remarks, in his first speech since prostate surgery last month, were a reminder of Iranian suspicions of the west despite the rise of a common foe. 'America, Zionism, and especially the veteran expert of spreading divisions, the wicked government of Britain, have sharply increased their efforts of creating divisions between the Sunnis and Shi'ites,' he said. Islamic State, known to its detractors by its Arabic acronym Da'esh, has overrun swathes of war-torn Syria and Iraq in recent months. Despite being adversaries for decades, Shi'ite power Iran and the U.S. both oppose the militants and have armed local groups fighting them. Senior officials from both countries have denied any plans to work together, however. 'They created Al Qaeda and Da'esh in order to create divisions and to fight against the Islamic Republic, but today, they have turned on them (Islamic State),' Khamenei said. The U.S. along with several Sunni Arab monarchies began a campaign of air strikes against Islamic State militants in Syria on September 23. Other Western countries, including Britain, have also taken part in bombing raids against Islamic State positions in Iraq. Khamenei's accusation appeared to be reference to Western support for the rebel forces fighting Tehran's close ally, Syrian President Bashar-al Assad. Hardline Islamists have emerged as the rebels' strongest military element. There are persistent rumours that many rebels trained and armed by the West have gone on to join Isis. A recent survey of armaments used by Isis found the U.S. was the third biggest source, after Russia and China. Conflict Armament Research worked alongside Kurdish forces to study small-calibre ammunition recovered from jihadi forces. Iran also believes the United States and Britain are using the Islamist threat to justify their renewed presence in the region. 'A careful and analytic look at the developments reveals that the U.S. and its allies, in efforts that are falsely termed countering Daesh, seek to create division and enmity among the Muslims rather to destroy the root causes of that (terrorist) current,' Khamenei said. 'Shi'ites and Sunnis must know that any action or remark, including insulting one another, leads to increased sensitivities and ignite flames. This will certainly benefit the common enemy of all Muslims.' Islamic State fighters fighting Kurdish forces in Kobane: Despite being adversaries for decades, Shi'ite power Iran and the U.S. both oppose the militants and have armed local groups fighting them . Khamenei's criticism was a counterpoint to an apparent thaw in British-Iranian relations when President Hassan Rouhani met British Prime Minister David Cameron in New York in September - a move that was criticised by hardliners at home. That meeting followed decades of strained relations which worsened when Britain closed its embassy in Tehran after hardliners stormed it in November 2011. Britain decided in June this year to reopen the facility, but the embassy has yet to open its doors.","Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says Isis is part of a divide and conquer strategy .

"St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch announced on Monday night that Darren Wilson would not be indicted in a bizarre press conference that instead found others to blame. In the 25-minute announcement, he slammed news outlets and social media - suggesting they were responsible for the tension after the August 9 shooting, rather than the shooting itself. 'The most significant challenge encountered in this investigation has been the 24-hour news cycle and its insatiable appetite for something, for anything to talk about, following closely behind with the non-stop rumors on social media,' he said. Scroll down for video . Lashing out: St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch is pictured at Monday's press conference in which he apparently blamed social media for the tension following the August 9 shooting . The users of social media promptly expressed their shock at the claim. 'Remember that time social media shot an unarmed teenager, and left his body on the street for four hours? Bob McCulloch remembers,' actor Wil Wheaton tweeted. Author Maureen Johnson said: 'Social media isn't the problem. Shooting children is the problem.' Writer and activist Kimberly C. Ellis added: 'Bob McCulloch is blaming social media again. Meanwhile, if it weren't for social media, we wouldn't even know about #MikeBrown #Ferguson.' McCulloch also turned on the witnesses, saying their statements were largely inconsistent and 'some were completely refuted by the physical evidence'. No charges: Michael Brown, left, was shot dead by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, pictured right in an evidence photo, in August but on Monday, it was announced that he will not be indicted . Fighting back: After the press conference, Twitter users ridiculed McCulloch's insinuation that the media and social media were to blame for the tension after the shooting, rather than the shooting itself . Annoyed: Another user, actor Wil Wheaton, also expresses his shock over the bizarre finger pointing . In another poor choice of words, McCulloch said the 12-person grand jury 'gave up their lives' while combing over the evidence and meeting with experts. CNN's legal expert Jeffrey Toobin called the press conference 'an extended whine' and said it was 'entirely inappropriate and embarrassing'. The grand jury ultimately decided that Darren Wilson would not face a trial for shooting dead 18-year-old Michael Brown in broad daylight in Ferguson, Missouri in August. Following the death, there were mass - sometimes violent - demonstrations in Ferguson and across the country as protesters called for the police officer to be held accountable. On Monday, McCulloch released details about the incident, including how Brown allegedly taunted Wilson in his police car, saying he was 'too much of a p***y to shoot me' after the officer asked him and a friend to walk on the sidewalk instead of in the road. A confrontation ensued and Wilson claimed he felt overpowered by the 6ft 5 teen, who he went on to fire at 12 times. Anger: Protesters parade in the parking lot of a burning auto parts store in Ferguson on Monday night after McCulloch announced that the police officer would not be indicted in the shooting . The New Republic also commented on how McCulloch's announcement, which detailed the police investigation and decision, also implicitly dismissed the need for a trial. 'The point of a grand jury isn't to determine beyond a shadow of a doubt what actually happened,' Noam Scheiber wrote. 'It's to determine whether there's probable cause for an indictment, which requires a significantly lower standard of proof. 'That McCulloch appeared to turn the grand jury into an exercise in sorting out the former rather than the latter suggested he wanted no part of a trial.' Wheaton added on Twitter: 'If only there were some process, perhaps a legal process, to present conflicting accounts and statements, weigh them, and come to a verdict.'","St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch announced on Monday that Darren Wilson would not be indicted for killing Michael Brown .

"A British Greenpeace activist facing charges of hooliganism in Russia has told how she felt so isolated in prison that she tapped out messages to fellow inmates on radiator pipes. Alex Harris, 27, said the code 'kept her going' during her time in jail where she was forced to spend 23 hours a day alone in her cell. She was among the so-called Arctic 30 protesters arrested on board a Greenpeace ship in September while demonstrating against oil drilling in the Arctic. Scroll down for video . 'Terrifying': Greenpeace activist Alex Harris speaks about her ordeal in a Russian prison after being released on bail on charges of hooliganism over a protest against oil drilling in the Arctic . Isolated: Ms Harris told how she communicated with fellow inmates by tapping messages on a radiator pipe . Ms Harris, from Exeter, Devon, said she was 'terrified' when she was first taken to the prison in Murmansk. But when she discovered there was a fellow activist next door, she devised a painstaking way to communicate. She told the BBC: 'There was a radiator pipe that ran all the way through the prison. 'We managed to have some conversation on the radiator pipes - one tap was A, two taps was B. Sometimes it took 23 taps to get out one letter. 'Even though we couldn't see each other, it felt like we were together.' British Greenpeace activists Kieron Bryan, left, . and Alexandra Harris, right, have been freed on bail following two . months in a Russian prison after being arrested for attempting to occupy . an Arctic oil platform . Ms Harris said the past two months in prison had been difficult, describing the conditions as 'awful' and the food as 'disgusting' The group were originally charged with . piracy, an offence that carries a 15-year prison sentence, which Ms . Harris feared would mean she could never have children. The new charge has a maximum term of seven years. A . Russian court yesterday granted bail to the last of 30 crew . members detained since their September protest. The decision to . free the ship's Australian radio operator Colin Russell reversed an . earlier ruling and is likely to take diplomatic pressure off Russia as . it prepares to host the upcoming Winter Olympic Games. Freed: Greenpeace activist Anthony Perrett, from Newport has also been released on bail . Russell . was the only member of the multinational Arctic Sunrise crew to have . had his bail request denied in a series of hearings held since November . 18. The campaigners' open-sea protest targeted what will be Russia's first operational oil . rig in the Arctic - a politically sensitive region that President . Vladimir Putin views as the future of the country's energy exporting . might. Earlier this month, Ms Harris skipped for joy when a judge in St Petersburg ruled could be granted bail. ‘This has been the hardest experience . of my life,’ she said afterwards, adding: ‘I will not dishonour . Greenpeace or my country by trying to flee Russia or the investigation.’ Activist Anthony Perrett and . journalist Kieron Bryan have also been bailed. They were among six . British nationals in the ‘Arctic 30’ who were imprisoned following the . protest against drilling in the Arctic. Ms Harris, 27, who acted as . communications officer on Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise vessel, said: ‘I’m . really happy. It’s not over yet but there’s light at the end of the . tunnel.’ In a recent letter to her parents, the activist had said she . was ‘trying very, very hard not to lose hope’. ‘Surely my future isn’t . rotting in a prison in Murmansk?!’ she wrote. Speaking at the family home in Dolton, . north Devon, earlier this month, her father Cliff said: ‘This is fantastic news for us. 'It . was nice to see her come into the courtroom with a smile on her face and . holding her head high. 'These must have been two incredibly hard months . for her, and we’re incredibly proud of how she has conducted herself . throughout this ordeal.’ Impounded: A crew member keeps watch aboard a Russian coast guard boat, left, as the Greenpeace ship 'Arctic Sunrise', right, is anchored next to it, in a small bay near Severomorsk, after it was seized by Russian forces . Mr Harris, 63, told how as a child, his daughter idolised David Attenborough and was fascinated by news about the environment. He said: ‘Anything that was detrimental to wildlife she would sit up and take notice. ‘I can remember when she was young she . had a poster up of David Beckham. All of a sudden Beckham was out of . favour and David Attenborough was her new hero. She didn’t actually have . any posters, but she really idolised him.’ Miss Harris joined Greenpeace two . years ago in an office-based role and was on her first field trip when . arrested by the Russians. Her father continued: ‘We didn’t envisage that . this whole situation was going to erupt like it did. We’ve found it . very frightening. These are just ordinary people who care about the . environment. The charges are ridiculous – what happened wasn’t piracy or . hooliganism.’ Greenpeace has warned a spill in . Arctic waters would be highly damaging to the environment and the . extraction of more fossil fuels would add to climate change impacts. Eleven Nobel Peace Prize laureates wrote to Russian president Vladimir . Putin calling for the original piracy charges to be dropped.","Alex Harris, 27, said she was 'terrified' when taken to jail in Murmansk .

"Hong Kong police moved in to clear barricades from pro-democracy protest zones today, in a sign of authorities' growing impatience as the student-led demonstrations continue into their third week. Appearing to use a strategy of chipping away at the three main protest zones, hundreds of police fanned out in the early hours to take down barriers the protesters had erected overnight. Officers used electric saws and bolt cutters to take down bamboo scaffolding built in the Admiralty area after a mob of masked men stormed some of the barricades the day before. The barricades have choked off traffic in Hong Kong's key business districts for more than two weeks.

Anger: A protester cries after police removed  barricades that protesters have set up to block off main roads in Central district . Fear: Police keep watch on protesters as officers carry out the task of dismantling the barricades which have blocked Central district . A few dozen protesters who sat guarding one entrance to the main occupied zone after the police came were exhausted but defiant. 'I'm feeling a bit lost. There is no dialogue with the government, and the truth is we are affecting people's lives. But we can't bear to leave without getting any results,' said Mark Li, a 21-year-old college student. Mr Li and his friends said they were not afraid of a crackdown but were weary of police tactics to weaken their movement. 'I just hope we can keep fighting in the long term. It won't end so quickly - it's just a stalemate at the moment,' said Jason Wong, 19. Police used sledgehammers to smash concrete used by protesters to secure the barriers to the road. They dismantled structures of plywood, rubbish bins, wooden pallets and other objects blocking the road, which runs parallel to a major highway that has become the protesters' main camp. Police also cleared out protesters' tents and took down other makeshift barricades of plywood, trash cans and items collected by demonstrators to block a busy road on the periphery of the main protest zone in the former British colony. Police negotiated with one last protester - who said he had an injured leg - to leave his tent. The bamboo and tents were scooped up into the back of a dump truck while the barricades and other safety barriers were piled into trucks and vans.

People photograph teams of police officers removing the barricades protesters set up to block off main roads in Central district . Hundreds of other officers held back protesters and bystanders watching the scene in front of the upscale Pacific Place shopping mall near the heart of the city's financial district. Some protesters chanted, 'Triads!' - a reference to allegations vehemently denied by police that they have been working with organized crime gangs. Before dawn, when protesters' numbers are fewest, police also removed metal barricades from another protest camp on a road in the nearby Causeway Bay shopping area to free up a lane for traffic. By gradually reducing the protest areas from the edges and acting during the quiet morning hours, police appear to want to avoid the sort of combative confrontation that backfired two weeks ago, when the street protests started. Then they went in with tear gas and pepper spray in an abortive attempt to clear the streets that caused international outcry. Hundreds of police began work in the early hours to begin taking down barricades when the fewest protesters were around . The barricades have choked off traffic in Hong Kong's key business districts for more than two weeks . Police forces keep vigil after the removal of the pro-democracy barricades, which have mainly been manned by students . Police spokesman Steve Hui said officers will continue to take down barriers set up by protesters. He said 23 men were arrested in yesterday's violent clashes, when masked men and taxi drivers led a crowd of several hundred who tried to rush the protest zone. The protesters want China's government to drop plans for a pro-Beijing committee to screen candidates in the territory's first direct elections, promised for 2017. They also demand that Hong Kong's deeply unpopular Beijing-backed leader, Leung Chun-ying, resign. Proposed talks between the two sides last Friday were called off by the city government, which said a constructive outcome was unlikely given their sharp differences. Mr Leung has said there is 'almost zero chance' that China's central government will change its rules for the 2017 election.

The couple sprint off to their wedding: Chinese state media has chided demonstrators for being naive and lacking life experience . Defences: The bamboo barricades were only put up by demonstrators in Admiralty district last night after an attack by masked men . Determined: Although their numbers have dwindled from the protest peak, many demonstrators say they will fight to the end . The Beijing government is eager to end the protests to avoid encouraging activists and others on the mainland seen as a threat to the Communist Party's monopoly on power. State media in mainland China has downplayed the crisis. In its noon report today, state broadcaster CCTV carried images of barricades being dismantled and street interviews with residents cheering the reopening of roads, complaining about the loss of business, and chiding the students for being naive and lacking life experience. At the main protest zone outside Hong Kong's government headquarters, a tent city has sprung up as dozens of demonstrators camp out to defend the highway they have taken over. Many said they will not budge. 'No one knows how long this will last. I'm not afraid of the police and I will fight to the end,' said Alan Yip, 24, who quit his job to join the movement. 'If they come in here I will sit down and let them take me away.'","Police used chainsaws and bolt cutters to dismantle bamboo scaffolding put up in Admiralty last night .

"After what seems to be a rather uncomfortable weekend for Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Russian president has applauded the Australian government's handling of the event in Brisbane. In an address to supporters in Moscow, Mr Putin had kind words to say about not only the atmosphere of the conference but also about Tony Abbott, despite the prime minister threatening he would 'shirtfront' the Russian leader over the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines MH17 before it started. '(Our) Australian partners created an extraordinarily welcoming atmosphere for work. I was surprised by the warmth with which normal Australian citizens received our delegation,' Mr Putin said, according to an official transcript. Scroll down for video . Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) has applauded Australians following the G20 summit in Brisbane . Mr Putin's seemed to fly in the face of media reports that the Russian president was so frustrated at being sidelined and subjected to tough talk by Western leaders that he left the summit early. Mr Putin's visit to Australia was marred by a series of diplomatic snubs and frostiness from Western leaders, sparking an early exit for the Russian strongman who flew out of Australia on Sunday afternoon, cutting his intended stay short. While Mr Putin's delegation claimed his swift exodus was as a result of the long flight back to Russia and his need to be well-rested for his return to official business on Monday morning, some have speculated whether a 'tense' meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron was the straw that broke the President's back. Another contributor to the strain between Mr Putin and other nations came when Mr Abbott, President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe used the G20 to criticise Russian's efforts to destabilise eastern Ukraine. Putin (above) shook hands with the police as he left Brisbane. In an address to supporters in Moscow he said he was surprised by the warmth of everyday Australians . The Russian leader's comments come amid rumours he left Australia early after frostiness from other leaders . But despite all this Mr Putin thanked the host country and its prime minister - who he described as a 'very businesslike person' - before his departure on Sunday and praised the 'constructive atmosphere' of the summit, news.com.au reported. Mr Abbott also backed down on the strong stance he had taken against his Russian counterpart before the G20 summit, putting differences aside and acknowledging President Putin was a guest in Australia. 'President Putin is a member of the G20 and I was happy to treat him with respect and courtesy while he was here in Australia,' Mr Abbott said.

"At least 20,000 people with dementia are put on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway every year, Parliament has been told. A national audit suggests that one in six of the people placed on the pathway each year have either a primary or secondary diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, or another form of dementia. Dr Philip Howard, a consultant gastroenterologist in London, said this raised huge concerns because these patients could not have been meaningfully consulted on whether life-saving treatment should be withdrawn. Some 130,000 people are believed to be placed on the pathway every year (posed) He said that, given the fact that another 45 per cent of people were unconscious when placed on the pathway, it meant more than half are never asked whether they want their life to come to an end. The doctor made his explosive comments at a meeting with peers in the House of Lords. The Liverpool Care Pathway aims to reduce suffering in the last hours and days of a dying person’s life. MP Norman Lamb has launched an inquiry . Doctors can withdraw fluids and drugs from patients if they are deemed close to death. Care services minister Norman Lamb has launched an inquiry into the way the pathway operates, following concerns that patients and relatives are often not consulted by doctors when people are placed on the scheme. Dr Howard said: ‘There is an urgent need to restore the confidence of the public in the medical profession and of individual patients and their loved ones in their doctors and nurses. ‘The most important person on the ward round is the dying patient. We should never walk away from the dying patient – either metaphorically or literally.’ Some 130,000 people are believed to be placed on the pathway every year. Dr Howard’s figures come from a national audit carried out by the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute in Liverpool. Baroness Knight, who called the meeting in the Lords, said the statistics were shocking. ‘If a patient has dementia, how can it be possible for them to agree to what is put to them? What we are seeing more and more is (doctors) putting people on the pathway without saying anything to them or their relatives.’ She added: ‘What is happening is that people are now afraid to go into hospital, and that is bad for doctors and bad for medical care.’ Dr Howard called for meetings between patients, relatives and doctors about the pathway to be recorded on video, as proof that people have been properly consulted. He said the pathway was ‘flawed in principle and practice’ because it came into play when doctors decided a person is close to death, yet there was no evidence that doctors can predict when that stage has been met.","Liverpool Care Pathway aims to reduce suffering in the last hours and days of a dying person's life .

"Thomas Cook has been forced to apologise to a family after their flight home from Turkey was delayed by 54 hours and they were put up in a 'disgusting' hotel. Lola Tomkinson, 32, of Chesterton, was returning from a week-long holiday in Bodrum with her mum, Carol, 55, and auntie, Alice Watt, 60, at a picturesque seaside resort. The trio had paid £296 each for an all-inclusive stay at the three-star Tuntas Beach Hotel to celebrate Carol's 55th birthday. Lola Tomkinson, 32, of Chesterton, was delayed 56 hours in Bodrum and put up in a 'disgusting' hotel . But their trip home turned sour after their initial return flight to Manchester Airport was delayed on Friday, October 24. They were eventually taken to the Milashan Hotel at 5am the following day and told to return to the airport at 9am for a replacement flight. Lola was on holiday with her mother Carol Tomkinson (left) and auntie Alice Watt (right) However, after three hours sleep, the family returned to the airport only for their second flight to be cancelled, forcing them to spend another night at the hotel. Unhappy with the standard of the accommodation, Lola took photos showing exposed wires, dirty marks on the floor and windowsill, and a filthy bathroom. The holidaymaker said she found bed bugs on the mattress and flies over the floor, as well as a toilet which leaked every time it was flushed. They were returned to the airport at 9am on the Sunday  and eventually arrived back in the UK at 4pm that afternoon. The flight delays, blamed on the combination of a broken-down plane and poor weather conditions, meant it took the family 54 hours to fly home. On Friday, single mum-of-two and carer Lola slammed Thomas Cook for putting them up in a dirty hotel while other travellers were taken to a four-star resort. She said the unsavoury end to their trip made it a holiday from hell. 'I am angry at how we were treated. I came back in tears,' she said. 'The holiday was completely ruined by those last days. We went together to celebrate mum's birthday so it was important that we had a nice time. 'Over those two days I was frustrated and tired so I can't imagine how the people with kids felt. We weren't looked after properly and treated the way customers should be. 'The hotel they took us to wasn't even a Thomas Cook hotel. There were bugs in the bed and there were flies all over the floor. 'The bed sheets were wet and you couldn't turn the air-con off cold. They also stank like they hadn't been washed for years. Your feet stuck to the floor and when you flushed the toilet the water was coming out of the bottom. 'We had no toiletries left so we couldn't shower and when we asked the staff they pointed at other hotel guests and told us to ask them so we had to scrounge. A dirty pipe (left) in the room and the view from the Milashan Hotel, where they were put up by Thomas Cook . 'It was disgusting. I kept crying my eyes out. Every time we asked for something the hotel staff either said ""no"" or that they couldn't speak English. You couldn't get any help.' When they arrived at the airport on Sunday Lola said fellow travellers were comparing notes and photos from a different hotel they were sent to and saying 'what a brilliant time they had'. 'I want an apology from Thomas Cook. They didn't look after our well-being at all. It was a real holiday from hell,' Lola said. Lola's mum, Carol, from Buglawton, Cheshire, who suffers from a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, added: 'I still feel stressed thinking about what happened. I have been on holiday with Thomas Cook for 20 years and never had a bad experience. Tomkinson took these images of exposed wires (left) and a power socket that is detached from the wall . 'We had such a good time until the flight was delayed and we were taken to a filthy hotel. I've never been treated like that before.' Holidaymakers are entitled to receive between £200 and £480 compensation for flight delays of at least three hours in countries within the European Union. The ruling follows a landmark legal victory by former teacher Jeff Halsall, who took Thomas Cook to court over a 22-hour flight delay in Tenerife. Lola (centre) with Carol (left) and Alice (right) during their holiday why . But Lola, Carol and Alice, from Crewe, Cheshire, have been told they will have to wait at least a month before finding out about their compensation claim. Thomas Cook has now apologised to all customers affected by the flight delays. A spokesperson for Thomas Cook Airlines said: 'We’d like to sincerely apologise to our customers for the long delay to their flight from Bodrum to Manchester, which was caused by an unexpected technical fault, after a diversion due to bad weather, which required repair overnight in Turkey. The Milashan Hotel, which Lola Tomkinson complained was below her expectations . 'We provided welfare and hotel rooms overnight for our customers. We know how frustrating these delays are, and we’d like to thank our customers for their patience and understanding.” 'We’d also like to apologise further to those customers that were moved from their hotel during the day on the 25th October – we have worked hard to ensure that they had suitable overnight accommodation for the evening of Saturday 25th October prior to their departure on the Sunday.' Later on Friday afternoon, the company added: 'Thomas Cook Airlines can confirm that the Tomkinson party have been in touch with regards to their delayed flight, and we will be contacting them promptly to fully address their concerns in an open and fair manner.'","Lola Tomkinson, her mum  and auntie were delayed 54 hours in Bodrum .

"Roberto Martinez was proud of his Everton side after they battled for more than an hour with 10 men before ultimately bowing out of the FA Cup on penalties at West Ham. The Hammers prevailed 9-8 in the shootout to go into the fourth round after the scores were tied at 2-2 after extra time, but Martinez drew comfort from the way his side responded to Aiden McGeady being sent off early in the second half. Enner Valencia had put the hosts in front before McGeady was given his marching orders, but Everton got back into the game through a wonderfully-struck Kevin Mirallas free-kick. Roberto Martinez was proud of his Everton side after they battled for more than an hour with 10 men . West Ham won 9-8 in the shootout to go into the fourth round after the scores were tied at 2-2 after extra time . Second-half substitute Mirallas then teed up Romelu Lukaku in extra-time to put the Toffees ahead, only for West Ham's Carlton Cole to poke home with his first touch and take the tie to penalties. Steven Naismith missed Everton's second but Stewart Downing passed up the chance to seal the win when his tame fifth effort was kept out by Joel Robles, who had made a string of impressive saves throughout the game. How cruel, therefore that the Spanish goalkeeper - who won the competition with Wigan two years ago - thrashed his own penalty against the bar and could not keep out Adrian's effort as West Ham made it through. 'We had to deal with the worst role in the game - going down to 10 men for over an hour. I'm extremely satisfied with the manner of coping with that,' Martinez said. 'The players showed the right manner and concentration and we didn't for a minute look like team with a man down. We showed a very good, strong mentality. It is just disappointing.

Everton striker Lukaku points to the sky to dedicate his goal against West Ham to Junior Malanda . West Ham manager Sam Allardyce saw his side win on penalties at Upton Park on Tuesday night . 'West Ham were really strong but I thought we deserved to go through. The effort and performance made us the better team tonight. Penalties really is a tough way to be eliminated from best competition in club football.' The Spaniard was also left bemoaning a decision to not award his side a penalty when they were 2-1 up in extra-time. 'You can see why he gave the two yellow cards (to McGeady) but there is no justification in how the referee has not seen (that) Mirallas' free-kick was in the box,' he added. 'He has given a free-kick outside the box and clearly it's in the box. The linesman has given it and should've seen the action in the box. ' Martinez's opposite number Sam Allardyce described the topsy-turvy contest as 'unbelievable' as it showcased the magic of the cup. 'The highs and lows in one particular game. It has been a long time since I experienced such highs and lows in one match. Such excitement. It was end to end from the first whistle - nothing like a Premier League game,' he said. Aiden McGeady is shown a second yellow card and sent off during the FA Cup third-round replay . Martinez on the referee's decision to send McGeady off: 'You can see why he gave the two yellow cards' 'Both teams went out and played and tried to win it. In the end we got what we deserved, there is no doubt about that. 'Unfortunately we missed too many chances, their goalkeeper made some fantastic saves. We had 23, 24 attempts. We missed and fluffed a few and had to rely on penalties in the end to win it. 'Everton have been a bit of a bogey team for us and when Stewart Downing missed it I thought 'here we go again'. 'But Adrian saved one brilliantly and took the last one, he was calm. He was determined and it was a victory we deserved over the two legs.'","West Ham beat Everton 9-8 in a penalty shootout to win the FA Cup tie .

"For fans of the cult film the Karate Kid, it is a familiar pose. However, in the latest video from the US military team developing a two legged fighting robot, the buildup to 'crane kick' is seen in a new way. The researchers taught the robot to stand on one leg - recreating a key scene from the film in the process. Scroll down for video . The Atlas robot has already shown it can walk, jump and even drive a car . According to Boston Dynamics, Atlas is a 'high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor, rough terrain. 'Atlas can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift, carry, and manipulate the environment. 'In extremely challenging terrain, Atlas is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet, to pick its way through congested spaces.' The Atlas robot created by Google-owned firm Boston Dynamics is a formidable figure at 6ft 2in tall and weighing in at 330lb. The robot boasts 28 hydraulically actuated joints and stereo vision, and is one of the most advanced robots ever created. However, it's not just karate - Ian has another trick up his sleeve - software written by the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Interaction which allows him to drive a car. 'To achieve this level of maneuverability in robots, researchers at IHMC look toward nature,' the team say. 'Inspired by the speed of cheetahs, the endurance of horses, the maneuverability of monkeys, and the versatility of humans, IHMC researchers are on a quest to develop legged robots that are fast, efficient, and graceful, with the mobility required to access many of the same places that humans can.' At the US Government's Robo-Olympics, Ian came second, despite competing as a virtual software simulation. Despite his lack of limbs, the world's most innocuously named 'bot was able to walk, carry a fire hose and, most impressively, get in a car and drive it. The 'crane' stance, being held by Karate Kid Daniel LaRusso (played by Ralph Maccio left) in the 1984 film inspired the latest movements of the Atlas robot.

"This is the adorable moment a baby elephant attempts to take on a bus load of tourists with its most ferocious charge - before thinking better of it and running back to its mum. The 12-month-old calf was caught on camera running full-on at the holidaymakers, who were visiting the Mfuwe Lodge in South Luangwa National Park, Zambia. It even attempts jumping up on its back legs practising its most terrifying moves. Getting ready: The calf stands by the herd as the tourists film from a nearby bus . But the rest of the herd carries on grazing, oblivious to its efforts. And when the calf realises its on his own, it thinks better of the bold move - and spins round and runs back to mum as fast as it can. Amy Alderman, from The Bushcamp Company, which runs the photographic safaris, said: 'It's pretty unusual to see a young calf behaving like this. Feeling brave: The baby elephant then takes a run up to the bemused tourists . It rears up on to its hind legs as it attempts to scare the holidaymakers . 'The babies usually stick pretty close to their mum's tummy until they're about a year old, and this little guy seems to be bold enough to be making his first moves in the world.

'But when the rest of the herd completely ignore the busload of tourists, and his attempt at scaring them off, he obviously still needs his mum - because it's not long before he runs back to her!

"Russia will increase its Black Sea fleet with more than 80 new warships by 2020 and will complete a second naval base for the fleet near the city of Novorossiysk by 2016, its commander said on Tuesday. In comments made to President Vladimir Putin as he visited the port city, Vice Admiral Alexander Vitko said a second Black Sea base was needed in addition to the main base on the Crimea peninsula annexed from Ukraine because of Nato expansion. 'Eighty ships and other vessels are expected to arrive (in Novorossiysk) before 2020. The Black Sea Fleet will have 206 ships and vessels by 2020,' Vitko told Putin. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a welcome ceremony in front of the 'Vice-Admiral Kulakov' large anti-submarine ship in the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, Russia, on Tuesday . 'Nato ships are constantly present in the Black Sea and it plans to establish a naval base in the Black Sea,' he added. The comments came amid fresh reports of fighting around Donetsk airport between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian government troops. Nato has regularly conducted naval exercises in the Black Sea, especially since Russia annexed Crimea, populated mainly by ethnic Russians, in March partly from fear that Ukraine's new pro-Western authorities might try to join the Atlantic alliance. A Nato official told Reuters in Brussels there were no alliance plans to build a Black Sea base but said it already had access to the resources of member states in the region. A stony-faced Putin inspects information stands on the development of the Azov and Black Sea region ports infrastructure in Novorossiysk . 'Our Black Sea allies have ports that we use from time to time but (there are) no plans to build a Nato base as suggested,' the official said. Three Nato members have a Black Sea coastline - Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. The former Soviet republic of Georgia, on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, has sought membership in the past but like Ukraine is very unlikely to be admitted any time soon due to Moscow's fierce opposition to Nato's further eastern expansion. During Nato exercises in western Ukraine earlier this month, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu promised to boost the number of troops in Crimea. On Tuesday, Shoigu was overseeing Russian military exercises involving 155,000 servicemen in the Far East.

Putin is seen visiting the Vice-Admiral Kulakov Russian Destroyer at the Naval Base of the Black Sea Fleet on September 23 . He told Putin in a video conference that the army's firepower and assault capabilities had increased lately as part of spending plans for the armed forces set to cost hundreds of billions of dollars. 'The firing, assault and manoeuvre capabilities ... have increased due to the supplies of modern weapons and equipment,' Shoigu said. Russia plans to spend 21 trillion roubles (£330billion) by the end of the decade on refurbishing Russia's armed forces. Some of those funds will be used to improve the defence infrastructure of Crimea. Russia has staged several military exercises this year, including near Ukraine's border, which have contributed to the tensions with the West, which sees the increased training as sabre rattling amid the persistent disagreements over Ukraine. Meanwhile, pro-Russian rebels defiantly announced Tuesday they would stage their own elections in November, raising the stakes in a standoff with Kiev despite both sides moving to end five months of deadly fighting. The prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, said the eastern separatist region would hold elections to choose a parliament and a leader on November 2. Smoke from a burning fuel dump at the Donetsk airport can be seen from a pro-Russia separatist checkpoint on Tuesday. The airport, occupied by the Ukrainian army, was hit by overnight shelling from rebel positions . The chairman of the 'Supreme Soviet', or parliament, in the neighbouring Lugansk People's Republic, Alexei Karyakin, told the TASS news agency that the region would hold polls on the same day. The surprise announcements came just hours after Zakharchenko told the Interfax news agency the insurgents were withdrawing their big guns from the frontline under a peace plan forged with Kiev aimed at ending a conflict that has killed around 3,000 people. AFP journalists said they saw tanks moving back from an area near Donetsk - the main rebel stronghold in the industrial east - although fighting was reported around the city's airport in the morning. 'We have withdrawn artillery but only in those areas where the Ukrainian regular units have done the same,' Zakharchenko said. 'Where Ukraine hasn't withdrawn artillery, we haven't done so.' Ukraine had said Monday it was starting a pullback under the terms of the deal signed in Minsk on Saturday that calls for both sides to withdraw from the frontline and establish a 30-kilometre (20-mile) wide demilitarised zone. The separatists launched their uprising against Kiev in April, seizing towns and cities across the eastern rustbelt and holding disputed independence referendums in May for Donetsk and Lugansk.","Russia will increase its Black Sea fleet with more than 80 new warships .

Foley, 40, was killed in a graphic propaganda video released in August by the terrorist organization, which calls itself the Islamic State - but new details from his two years in captivity are still emerging. Fellow captives have now spoken out about their time in prison with Foley, whom they referred to as a pillar of strength. They revealed that he received the most brutal treatment out of dozens of hostages because he was American. Scroll down for video . Tortured: Journalist James Foley, pictured left reporting on the ground and right in his ISIS beheading video, was waterboarded and hung upside down during his two-year captivity . Foley, from Rochester, New Hampshire, was captured not far from the Syrian border with Turkey in 2012 by a small jihadist group which would later swear fealty to ISIS. As the group gained strength, his treatment worsened, according to a lengthy account of his capture and captivity published by the New York Times. As early as August 2013 - before ISIS caught the world's attention with its huge land grab in Iraq - Foley would regularly be lashed to a metal bar by the ankles and left dangling from the ceiling for hours. This element of his torture was revealed by Jejoen Bontinck, a 19-year-old Belgian who shared a cell with him. He told the Times: 'You could see the scars on his ankles. He told me how they had chained his feet to a bar and then hung the bar so that he was upside down from the ceiling.' Grabbed by the border: Foley was seized by jihadists near the Syrian border with Turkey. The group was took him later swore fealty to ISIS, which now calls itself the Islamic State . Later, after Foley was handed over to a central ISIS prison in Syria, with dozens of other captives, the torture became more targeted and extreme. Initially dozens of Western captives were held together, but ISIS began to release those whose governments would pay large ransoms for them. Eventually only Britons and Americans - whose governments refuse to pay out - were left, and the regime grew harsher. Former cellmates have said that Foley was routinely the victim of mock executions - and even waterboarding. One told how when Foley was taken from his cell by his captors, they would pray for him to return covered in blood, as if he was unmarked it would be a sign of even more savage treatments, such as the waterboarding technique, which simulates drowning. Working: Foley is pictured above filming in Tripoli, Lybia, in 2011 . ISIS has said they employ that form of torture as a direct response to the U.S. government's waterboarding of Al-Qaeda captives as part of the war on terror. In particularly bleak periods of captivity, the prisoners would also be practically starved, given the equivalent of a teacup full of food every day. As the prisoners were often kept in almost total darkness, they would often spill what little food they had as they attempted to eat. Torture: ISIS has said it uses waterboarding because the U.S. did in the War on Terror. Pictured is an example waterboard at a torture museum . Despite all this, Foley would share his limited rations with other captives, and gave up his blanket to somebody else in the depths of winter, other prisoners said. In a letter to Foley's family smuggled out by a fellow captive, he gives a more positive outlook of his captivity, and makes no mention of torture. He wrote: 'I have had weak and strong days. We are so grateful when anyone is freed; but of course, yearn for our own freedom. We try to encourage each other and share strength. Threats: ISIS released the videos showing the deaths of captives such as Foley, pictured above. They have been exclusively from the United Kingdom and the U.S. - whose governments do not pay ransoms . 'We are being fed better now and daily. We have tea, occasional coffee. I have regained most of my weight lost last year.' However, the letter implies that he has an inkling of his fate to come - one sentence of the message instructs his family on what to do with any money in his bank account should he die. ISIS itself has freely admitted that it waterboards prisoners, though it claims that they are in general 'treated well'. In a new propaganda video released this week, British war photographer John Cantile was put in front of the camera to describe his captivity. He said: 'Now unless we tried something stupid like escaping or doing something we shouldn't, we were treated well by the Islamic State. Admission: A new ISIS video featuring British photographer John Cantile was released this week, in which he said captives are waterboarded if they try 'something stupid' 'Some of us who tried to escape were waterboarded by our captors as Muslim prisoners are waterboarded by their American captors. 'Our strange little community of prisoners had its share of problems but apart from the odd fight we lived together in relative harmony through uncertain times. 'We read books, played recreational games and gave lectures on our specialist subjects. It wasn't a bad life.' He then described how successive European prisoners - Spanish, French, German and Danish - were let go while the British and American governments 'stone-walled' ISIS attempts to acquire ransoms. Cantile is the latest Westerner whom ISIS have indicated they are going to murder. There are also fears for Peter Kassig, an aid worker from Indianapolis. Videos showing the murders of American journalist Steven Sotloff, British humanitarian Alan Henning and David Haines, another British aid worker, have also been released.","Foley, 40, was captured in 2012 and killed on camera this August in Syria .

"A Sydney teenager who ran away to join jihadists in Syria is the pawn of terrorists who 'groomed' him just like paedophiles groom victims, a terror expert says. Abdullah Elmir has turned up in a propaganda video for terror group Islamic State - also known as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) - after disappearing from his Bankstown home in June, saying he was going fishing. In the clip, the 17-year-old threatens Australia and any nation that would try to stand in the group's way. Scroll down for video . Abu Khaled frrom Australia, thought to be Abdullah Elmir, speaks flanked by other ISIS fighters in the latest ISIS propaganda video . Professor Greg Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, said Elmir was recruited by wanted terrorist Mohammad Ali Baryalei, an Australian based in Syria. He said terror recruiters lured targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators. 'It's like sexual predation,' Prof Barton told AAP. 'Somebody might strike up a friendship in an online chat forum and present themselves in a different fashion - to try to get them into their web. 'By the time they actually meet the people they're speaking with, they may be in too deep to know better.' Sydney teen Abdullah Elmir reportedly told his mother he was 'going fishing' when he disappeared from his home in Bankstown in June . He said the boy appeared as a 'pawn in the machine' in the chilling video. 'He thinks he's the star ... but the reality is, his new friends have got him a one-way ticket,' he said. 'He's not in charge of his own destiny at all, he's being used.' Prof Barton said young people were the easiest to radicalise. 'Teenagers, 20-somethings, particularly young men more than young women, are vulnerable to making rash judgments,' he said. 'They tend to be more rebellious toward [older] generations and sceptical of establishment figures.' Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the 1.43 minutes long video is full of threats against the west . Bearded ISIS fighters, holding rifles, flank the Australian jihadi as he preaches hate . As he finishes his diatribe the men all cheer and chant in Arabic . It is believed former Kings Cross bouncer Baryalei, 33, recruited Elmir through western Sydney street preaching group Parramatta Street Dawah. 'He's said to have recruited 30 plus young people - mostly in western Sydney through Street Dawah,' Prof Barton said. The terror expert's comments come as the ginger-haired teenager's family have condemned his involvement in the video in which he declares ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land'. Elmir and his friend Feiz are believed to have made their way to Syria and Iraq after crossing the border from Turkey, where they were last known to have contacted family members. They travelled via Perth, with stops in Malaysia and Thailand, to join the likes of Australia's most notorious terrorists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar. 'What a stupid idiot,' an unnamed relative told the Daily Telegraph. 'We never associated with him, that guy was brainwashed, I don't know what these kids get into. 'They don't know how to fight... they should be getting an education and building this country up.' Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf is wanted by the Federal Police for his activities in Syria . Former Sydney boxer Mohamed Elomar posted photos of himself holding up decapitated heads on Twitter . Elmir begins the video by saying 'this message I deliver to you the people of America, this message I deliver to you the people of Britain and this message I deliver especially to you the people of Australia'. Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the video which is 1.43 minutes long is full of heavily worded threats and taunts the US-led coalition that recently began air strikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq. 'I say this about your coalition: you threaten us with your countries, bring every nation that you wish to us, bring every nation that you want to come and fight us. Whether it's 50 nations or 50 thousand nations it means nothing to us,' Elmir says. Reading from a script, a black and white scarf wrapped around his head and a huge rifle in his hand, he warns: 'Bring your planes bring everything you want to use because it will not harm us because we have Allah which is something you do not have.' In this photo a member loyal to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) waves an ISIL flag in Raqqa . A man holds up a knife as he rides on the back of a motorcycle touring the streets of Tabqa city with others in celebration after Islamic State militants took over Tabqa air base, in nearby Raqqa city . A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: 'This video again highlights the threat posed by ISIL.' 'As the Prime Minister has said on many occasions, ISIL is a threat that reaches out to Australia and our allies and partners.' Elmir's family told the Sydney Morning Herald in June they were devastated their son had been 'brainwashed'. His family's lawyer Zali Burrows told the Australian Associated Press: 'The family went to the media today as a plea to the government to bring their boy back. 'We know they have the intelligence to pinpoint him. 'The concern is that he’s being used as a tracking device to gather further intelligence, to see where he's actually going to go.' Ms Burrows questioned how Elmir  was not stopped by Federal Police, who were thought to be monitoring him.","Abdullah Elmir has appeared in a propaganda video for Islamic State .

"Controversial: The Prince today highlighted the conflict in Ukraine while talking about the legacy of the First World war in Belgium . Prince William used a speech about the legacy of the First World War yesterday to highlight the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. In a rare foray into international diplomacy, the second in line to the throne suggested the Ukraine conflict was not just a localised war but a threat to the whole of Europe. ‘The events in Ukraine testify to the fact that instability continues to stalk our continent,’ he said. He spoke at the Cointe Inter-allied Memorial in Belgium, where he was representing the Queen to commemorate the start of the Great War. While his father frequently puts his head above the parapet on sensitive international matters, William normally shies away from such controversial issues. However, addressing the audience in Liege, among them dignitaries including King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium, French president Francois Hollande and German president Joachim Gauck, the young royal said: ‘Edith Cavell was a British nurse who saved soldiers from each side. 'On the night before she faced a German firing squad she said, “I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.” ‘It took another terrible war to learn the truth of her words, and even today we continue to learn that lesson. ‘The events in Ukraine testify to the fact that instability continues to stalk our continent.’ As the prince spoke, news was breaking that Russia’s air force is to begin drills involving more than 100 aircraft from bases close to the Ukraine border. Putin’s annexation of the predominantly ethnic Russian region of Crimea – the first by a major power in Europe since 1945 – has already sparked international condemnation. In April, the Mail reported how Prince Charles told a Polish woman, who had lost many of her Jewish family in the Nazi Holocaust: ‘And now Putin is doing just about the same [in the Ukraine] as Hitler.’ Scroll down for video . Addressing the crowd: William, bottom left at the podium, spoke to an influential audience including the French and German presidents and the royal family of Belgium . His remark, made during an official tour of Canada, was seen as hugely inflammatory by the Russians. Putin described it as ‘unacceptable’ and ‘not royal behaviour’. Warming to his theme, William did, however, go on to praise the power of reconciliation. He continued: ‘The fact that the presidents of Germany and Austria are here today, and that other nations – then enemies – are here too, bears testimony to the power of reconciliation. 'We were enemies more than once in the last century, and today we are friends and allies. We salute those who died to give us our freedom. We will remember them.’ Prince Charles flew the flag at a national service of remembrance for the Commonwealth in Glasgow, while the Duchess of Cornwall was guest of honour at a candlelit Vigil of Prayer Service in Westminster Abbey. Stalking our continent: The Prince pointed out the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Pictured above are tanks deployed by the Kiev government against rebel fighters in the east of the country . Prince Andrew was in Belfast, as the Earl and Countess of Wessex attended a ceremony at Guildford Cathedral, and Princess Anne attended a service of commemoration at Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight. Prince Harry attended a ceremony on the coast at Folkestone in full Blues and Royals No 1 dress before flying to Belgium to join his brother and sister-in-law. Harry was at the Step Short commemoration – so called because of the order given to servicemen to shorten their stride as they descended into the harbour of Folkestone, the port of embarkation to, and return from, the Western Front for millions. The prince unveiled a 50ft, 13-ton Memorial Arch, the only new memorial to be built in this WWI centenary year. In a hand-written message on his wreath, Harry paid tribute to their heroism. ‘For all those who went down this road and never returned,’ he wrote.","The royal made rare foray into world diplomacy at Belgian memorial service .

"A phone call in which Phil Rudd allegedly threatened to kill a man and his daughter is the basis for the AC/DC drummer's court charges. Rudd, 60, is before the courts on charges of threatening to kill and possession of methamphetamine and cannabis. The Tauranga-based drummer has denied the charges. Scroll down for video . Phil Rudd, seen here outside court on Thursday, allegedly threatened to kill a man and his daughter . In a summary of facts released to media on Friday, the Crown has given a brief outline of what led to the charges. It says Rudd made a phone call to a man he knew, whose name is suppressed, on September 26, threatening to kill both him and his daughter. This was consistent with another phone call made by Rudd earlier that morning, the summary of facts said. It says Rudd denied threatening to kill anybody and denied making any of the phone calls he was alleged to have made when he was interviewed by police. The Tauranga-based AC/DC drummer has denied the charges . Rudd was back in court on Thursday after a fracas with another man on a Tauranga street . The drug charges were laid after police executed a search warrant at Rudd's home on November 6. Police say Rudd had 0.71g of methamphetamine and 130g of cannabis in his possession. Rudd was also charged with attempting to procure a murder when he appeared in court in November, but it was dropped by the crown solicitor the following day. Rudd was back in court on Thursday after a fracas with another man on a Tauranga street. Rudd was filmed being handcuffed by police and brought back before the court on Thursday . The AC/DC drummer was pictured outside the High Court at Tauranga on his security guard's back (left) after appearing in court on November 26 (right) He was filmed being handcuffed by police next to a black sports car by the side of Cameron Road, on the North Island of New Zealand and was then taken to the local station. However, his lawyer Paul Mabey told Daily Mail Australia that Rudd is now back out on bail. ‘He’s appeared on a breach of bail by speaking to a witness and has been rebailed. He’s been to court and gone home,’ Mr Mabey said. He was given an extra bail condition ordering him not to take illicit drugs. The threatening to kill case is due back in Tauranga District Court on February 10, when a date for a judge-alone trial is likely to be set.

"A picture of U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden and his American girlfriend at a Moscow theatre has emerged - and the possibility of the pair marrying in Russia has been raised. The former National Security Agency contractor is 'happy' that Lindsay Mills is with him in Moscow. The pole dancer was recently shown with America's most wanted man cooking in his flat in a fly on the wall documentary. 'Edward Snowden is happy that his girlfriend Lindsay Mills came to Russia and that she is supporting him,' said lawyer Anatoly Kucherena. Reunited with America's most wanted man: The former National Security Agency contractor is 'happy' that girlfriend Lindsay Mills is with him in Moscow . 'It's hard to predict if they are going to have a wedding in Russia.' He spoke as the new picture was issued by state-owned news agency RIA Novosti of the couple on a night out at the theatre. As usual no details were given about the location for security reasons, and Snowden had a hand partially covering his face. Kucherena said he is ready to help U.S. citizen Mills get a Russian residency permit or temporary asylum. Reunited: A new documentary Citizen Four reveals footage (pictured) of Edward Snowden and Lindsay Mills cooking in their wood-paneled apartment in Moscow where the former NSA contractor has claimed asylum . Earlier reports indicated Miss Mills had deserted him after he betrayed the U.S. government and divulged secrets about America's mass surveillance programmes. 'She was not entirely pleased but at the same time it was... it was an incredible reunion because she understood me. That meant a lot to me,' he said at the weekend. ' Snowden also admitted in the webcam interview at the New Yorker Festival that he misses America - a place he may never return to, Politico reported. Leaker: Snowden, left, who has claimed political asylum in Vladimir Putin's Russia, has been reunited with his pole-dancing girlfriend Lindsay Mills, right . Dancer: Mills, pictured left and right in an online video, is filmed cooking with Snowden in the documentary . 'The question is what don't I miss, whether it's my family, whether it's my home, whether it's my friends, whether it's my work at the agency, I was fulfilled and happy,' he responded. 'Things as simple as having my old beat-up car, there's a lot to miss. It's a great country.' Mills had remained silent and her whereabouts were largely unknown after Snowden's release of tens of thousands of classified U.S. intelligence documents in 2013. Moscow living: Snowden pictured on the Moscow river in Russia's capital where he sought asylum from the US . In love: The pair are pictured frolicking together before he fled the United States . Together again: The two, pictured on a Hawaiian beach before Snowden fled the U.S., have moved to Russia . Citizen Four, made by U.S. film maker Laura Poitras, premiered on Friday in New York, revealing Mills's location in the process. It shows the couple cooking in their wood-paneled Moscow apartment, which is decorated with plants. The dramatic shift from his seemingly idyllic life in Hawaii was far greater than Snowden had predicted, he said last night. 'It was about getting the information back to people so they could decide if they cared about it, and on that account … I could not have been more wrong in thinking that people wouldn't care,' he explained. 'NSA employees have used this surveillance power to spy on exes, to spy on lovers, and that’s a felony, however none of them were prosecuted because it was considered that the value of the programs was greater than the interests of justice.'","NSA leaker reunited with dancer Linsday Mills, with whom he lived in Hawaii .

"Manchester City’s Samir Nasri has quit international football after a breakdown in his relationship with manager Didier Deschamps and some of the French players. Nasri, who was controversially left out of France‘s squad for this summer’s World Cup in Brazil, made his decision after alleging that some of his international team-mates had criticised him behind his back. He said ‘My family suffered from this and I don’t want them to suffer. ‘With the French national team, I don’t feel like it anymore. I don’t want to be there. I am not happy, I don’t want to go there any more.’ VIDEO Scroll down for Deschamps: SamiNasri doesn't play for France like he does for City . International: Samir Nasri of France scores  past Steven Gerrard  during the UEFA EURO 2012 group D match . Club duty: Nasri  controls the ball during the International Champions Cup match against the Olympiakos . Nasri, 27, has been involved in a number of previous incidents connected with playing for France. He launched a foul-mouthed rant at journalists after his country’s exit from Euro 2012 against Spain and earlier this year girlfriend Anara Atanes aimed expletives at Deschamps on Twitter after he left Nasri out of his group for South America. On the eve of Sunday's Community Shield game at Wembley against former club Arsenal, Nasri tried to outline his decision to retire after 41 caps. ‘I’ve been thinking about it since the 2012 European Championship. This is just a confirmation of what I’ve been feeling,' he said. ‘Let’s face it, as long as he (Deschamps) is going to be the manager I don’t think I have a shot after everything that happened. ‘He said he didn’t pick me for the World Cup because I wasn’t happy on the bench, but I don’t know one player who is happy on the bench, especially when you don’t understand the reason.’ Finished: Nasri made the annoucnement on the eve of the Community Shield game against former club Arsenal . Unhappy camp: Nasri has been involved in a number of previous incidents connected with playing for France . Nasri insisted he would not return for Les Bleus even if Deschamps left and a new manager came in. ‘The French national team doesn’t make me happy. Every time I go there, it’s more trouble. I face accusations and my family suffer for it, and I don’t want to make them suffer. I think it’s wiser to stop it and focus on my club career. ‘It’s not just about the manager. He did what he thought was best for his team at the World Cup. ‘The press in France reported that other players were complaining about me. Why would I want to be in a group where other players can’t even be honest and tell me to my face if they have a problem with me. ‘I really love everything about football and I’ve played it since I was five-years-old. I just want to have as much pleasure as possible and with the French national team, I don’t feel like it any more. So it’s better to be focussed on Manchester City.’ Snap happy: Nasri poses for a photograph during a City in the Community event at Carrington Training Ground . A leading French TV presenter said before the World Cup that Nasri brought a “disease to the squad” and that team-mates didn’t like his attitude around the camp. Nasri signed a new five-year contract with City this summer and will look to add to a trophy haul that already includes two Premier League titles and a Capital One Cup. He says he is a more mature person now than the youngster who wound up people earlier in his career. ‘I’ve made some mistakes like everyone but I’ve learned and don’t want to repeat them. So I am trying to be more calm, more relaxed about everything and just enjoy every day because I know I am lucky to be a footballer.’ Samir Nasri was speaking at Manchester City’s Community Shield Media Day at Carrington, where he joined in to helped the Club’s Community Coaches train children from local schools and sports clubs.","Samir Nasri has announced his retirement from international football .

"Extremists holding Briton Alan Henning tormented his wife yesterday by sending her a message of him begging for his life. After months of having her desperate pleas for his release ignored, Barbara Henning was sent an audio file – apparently in response to US attacks on Islamic State forces yesterday. The 47-year-old father of two was captured by the group’s fanatics last December while delivering aid in Syria. They have threatened to behead him. The message is thought to be the first time Mrs Henning has heard her taxi driver husband’s voice in almost nine months. Horrific: Barbara Henning released a statement calling on the terrorists to free her husband after receiving the recording . His wife said: 'We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan's imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life' No precise details of the message were released and it was not known if the digital file was recorded before or after the air strikes began. In a statement, Mrs Henning revealed her husband had been tried by a sharia court in Syria and found ‘innocent’ of spying and to be no threat to Islamic State. The file is assumed to have been sent to her by email and a statement confirming its existence was released to the media by the Foreign Office. It emerged as: . Mr Henning has been the subject of an increasingly high profile campaign for his release from captivity. Last week 100 Muslim leaders based in the UK condemned his continued captivity. Over the weekend a string of radical preachers called for his release. ISIS is threatening to murder the 47-year-old former taxi driver from Manchester (left) Mrs Henning said last night: ‘An audio file of Alan pleading for his life has just been received by me. I and people representing me continue to reach out to those holding Alan. Islamic State continue to ignore our pleas to open dialogue. ‘I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State over Alan’s fate. The voices of the people have spoken out loud and clear. ‘He was working with Muslims to help the most vulnerable within Syria. Nothing has changed. He went to Syria to help his Muslim friends deliver much needed aid.’ In a statement released by the Foreign Office, she said: ‘We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan’s imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life. Mr Henning had just arrived in Syria in December 2013 when he was kidnapped by ISIS terrorists . ‘I have been told that he has been to a Sharia court and found innocent of being a spy and declared to be no threat. I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system. Please release Alan.’ His plight was revealed in an IS video showing the murder of a fellow British hostage, David Haines. The extremist group has previously released footage showing the killing of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Mr Henning and other hostages were thought to be held in a network of tunnels under the IS stronghold of Raqqa, but his brother-in-law Colin Livesey said the US strikes could have forced his captors on the run. Mr Livesey told ITV News: ‘It scares me. They’ll just run away, they’ll take him with them, and no one knows where he is again.’ Asked if he thought the air campaign had put Mr Henning at greater risk, he said: ‘Yes. I don’t like saying that because it’ll feel like I’m losing faith.’ He added: ‘He’s a loving husband and a loving father to two beautiful kids… he’s just an amazing guy. To miss his own family’s Christmas to do what he’s done, speaks volumes to what kind of man he is.’ British captive David Haines was seen being murdered by an ISIS executioner in a video released last week .

Meanwhile, ISIS has released forty nine hostages who were seized by Islamic militants in Iraq have been freed and safely returned to Turkey, . Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the hostages had been returned to Turkey following intense negotiations. The hostages were seized from the Turkish Consulate in Mosul, Iraq on June 11, when ISIS overran the city in its surge to seize large swathes of Iraq and Syria. Their release contrasts with the recent beheadings of two US journalists and a British aid worker by the Islamic State group, but it wasn't immediately clear what Turkey had done to secure the safe release of the hostages. The U.S. and Arab began air strikes on militant targets in Syria overnight.

There was also a separate U.S. attack on a different band of Islamist militants in Syria - the mysterious Al Qaeda-affiliated Khorasan Group, who are said to have been planning an 'imminent attack' on a Western target. None of Washington's usual Western allies has so far joined the campaign in Syria.

"A British drone blew up Islamic State fanatics as they tried to plant roadside bombs, it was announced yesterday. It is the first strike by a British Reaper drone against IS in Iraq. The heavily-armed Reaper appears to have killed a group of jihadists involved in a battle near Iraq’s largest oil refinery north of Baghdad. A number of the remotely piloted aircraft – armed with Hellfire missiles – have been deployed to spy on the brutal IS terrorists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria. They had been conducting surveillance for the past couple of weeks but at the weekend one of them struck. The attack will help the Iraqi army which is fighting to regain control of the area around the city of Baiji and the nearby refinery. It follows the announcement that Britain was stepping up its military presence in Iraq by committing more troops to train Iraqi fighters. Aerial attack: British forces conducted their first drone attacks on ISIS militants in Iraq over the weekend, the Ministry of Defence has said . A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘This weekend saw the first air strike by a Royal Air Force Reaper… as British forces continue to assist the Iraqi government in their fight against Isil (IS). ‘The Reaper… successfully attacked the terrorists using a Hellfire missile.’ Once the drones are launched from an airbase in Kuwait, they are controlled from RAF Waddington, in Lincolnshire. The MoD said RAF Tornado jets were also involved in airstrikes near Baiji over the weekend. The town was seized by militants in June but they failed to capture the refinery and on Sunday, officials said government forces had regained large areas of the town.

An undisclosed number of Reaper drones were moved to Iraq last month after they finished watching over the final days of the British campaign in Afghanistan. That number is expected to be ‘ramped up’ in the coming weeks, according to Defence sources. They joined RAF Tornado GR4 fighter-bombers and US jets and drones already flying over IS territory. It is understood drones are also flying surveillance missions over Syria. Yesterday the MoD also released details of ten strikes by warplanes since October 5. Footage from a strike on November 3 shows an RAF Tornado destroying a jihadist vehicle. At the same time, US Central Command said there had been 23 airstrikes in Syria and 18 in Iraq by US-led coalition forces since Friday last week. On Sunday morning, Two Tornados used a Brimstone missile to destroy a shipping container near Al Anbar, west of Baghdad. The MoD said the container was being ‘used by the terrorists to store equipment to support extortion and control of the local population’. Other RAF aircraft, including tankers, transport and surveillance platforms continue to support coalition operations.

"Ten-man Lazio held on to beat struggling AC Milan 1-0 on Tuesday and reach the Italian Cup semi-finals, putting Rossoneri coach Filippo Inzaghi's job in jeopardy. In Serie A, Milan are 10th with a five-match winless streak and was beaten 3-1 by Lazio on Saturday. Inzaghi, a former standout striker for Milan, is in his first season as a top-division coach, having previously managed the Rossoneri's youth side. Lucas Biglia celebrates in front of the away fans after scoring the opener at the San Siro . Biglia opened the scoring for Lazio late in the first-half with this penalty after Albertazzi's handball . Lazio took the lead in the 38th with a penalty from Lucas Biglia after a hand ball by Michelangelo Albertazzi. Lazio defender Lorik Cana was sent off for fouling Jeremy Menez from behind in the 45th, after a second bookable offence. Milan had a goal from Giampaolo Pazzini waved off for a hand ball by the forward in the 69th. Lazio then nearly doubled the lead when Keita Balde Diao hit the post in the 78th and another potential goal from Milan's Alessio Cerci was waved off for offside in added time. AC Milan goalkeeper Christian Abbiati saves an attempt to score by Lazio's  Keita Balde Diao . Milan's under pressure head coach Filippo Inzaghi reacts during their Coppa Italia quarter-final against Lazio . In the semi-finals, Lazio will face the winner of next week's match between Inter Milan and Napoli. In the other quarterfinals, it's Juventus versus Parma and Roma against Fiorentina. At the San Siro, Lazio were in control from the start. Nine minutes in, striker Miroslav Klose took advantage of an errant pass from Ignazio Abate but missed the target. Milan's Sulley Muntari and Lazio's Nigerian Ogenyi Onazi vie for the ball during their Coppa Italia clash . Another defensive mistake set up a chance for Keita in the 15th but Milan goalkeeper Christian Abbiati charged forward to break the play up. Earlier on Tuesday, Milan defender Philippe Mexes was banned for four matches for grabbing Lazio captain Stefano Mauri by the neck on Saturday. On Monday, Milan reported that forward Stephan El Shaarawy broke a bone in his right foot at the end of Saturday's loss. The Italy striker will have to wear a brace for six weeks before beginning rehabilitation and could miss the rest of the season.","Lazio beat AC Milan 3-1 at the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday in Serie A .

"Prisoner: Shaker Aamer, whose family lives in South London, has been detained at the US base in Cuba without trial or charge since November 2001 . The last British resident still detained at Guantanamo Bay Bay could by freed in the new year as part of a fresh push by President Obama to empty the prison, it has been reported. Shaker Aamer, whose family lives in South London, has been detained at the US base in Cuba without trial or charge since November 2001. It is understood that he is one of 64 prisoners who have been cleared for release and will be released in the next couple of months. Insiders from within the Obama administration indicated earlier this week that the president would like to reduce the number of prisoners at the camp from 132 to 68 as soon as possible. And Mr Aamer, 46, is among those who will be freed after no longer being deemed a threat, the Sunday Times has reported. Clive Stafford Smith, Mr Aamer's lawyer, told the newspaper that he believes his client will be returned to Britain. He said: 'I cannot believe they will not include Shaker, as it would be totally irrational. It's very hard for them to come up with an explanation as to why this hasn't been done'. There had been debate as to whether Mr Aamer, who is a Saudi Arabian citizen, would be able to return to Britain, but Mr Cameron has said that he will accept him back. The move to release more prisoners is the latest step in the president's gradual push to close the facility by the time he leaves office in 2017. There has been a recent trickle of releases. The Pentagon said last week that four Afghans held for over a decade at Guantanamo have been returned to their home country. And six prisoners were transferred to Uruguay earlier this month. Guantanamo was opened by Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, to house terrorism suspects rounded up overseas. Most of the detainees have been held for a decade or more without being charged or tried. Family man: There had been debate as to whether Mr Aamer, who is a Saudi Arabian citizen, would be able to return to Britain, but Mr Cameron has said that he will accept him back. Above, with two of his children . In a shocking revelation written in the Daily Mail earlier this month, Mr Aamer said that he has been beaten and starved of sleep and food while being held at Guantanamo Bay. Lawyers say he is still being held at the US base in Cuba only because intelligence officials fear he will expose more evidence of torture by the West. Mr Aamer claims he was in the room when a detainee called Ibn Sheikh al-Libi was being abused in the presence of British intelligence officers. Mr Aamer aroused suspicion because he had moved to Taliban-held Afghanistan with his family and was arrested there in mysterious circumstances after the regime fell in November 2001. He insisted that he was in Afghanistan to work for an Islamic charity but the CIA said he was a senior Al-Qaeda operative. However his supporters say nothing can justify his continued detention without trial. Earlier this month, celebrities, civil rights campaigners and politicians called for Barack Obama to secure the release of Mr Aamer in an open letter that was published in the Daily Mail. Organised by the We Stand With Shaker campaign, the letter has been signed by MPs from across the political spectrum, including former Tory shadow home secretary David Davis, Lib Dem MP and former Home Office minister Norman Baker, and Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn. Celebrity backers include Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, TV presenter Janet Ellis and her singer daughter Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and the actress Juliet Stevenson. It was also signed by journalist and author Peter Oborne, poet Benjamin Zephaniah, and novelist Gillian Slovo as well as prominent human rights campaigners including the Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti.","Shaker Aamer, 46, has been detained without trial or charge since 2001 .

"Chelsea midfielder Willian says he is aiming  to win every single trophy on offer to the club this season. The 26-year-old Brazilian ended his first season at the club last campaign without silverware, and told chelseafc.com that he is hoping to make amends this time round. Jose Mourinho's side currently sit four points clear at the top of the Premier League table, as well as being top of their Champions League group and into the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup. Willian is targeting the 'quadruple' for Chelsea this season after last season's trophyless campaign . The Brazilian vies with Manchester United defender Chris Smalling during their match with Chelsea last week . ‘The aim is to reach the summer and be able to celebrate the Quadruple: the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and Capital One Cup,’ Willian told their official website. ‘Why should we aim for any less? It's a dream and we all know it won't be easy. In fact, we know it will be a lot of hard work, but that is what we are here for.’ Chelsea overcame Shrewsbury Town in the fourth round of the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night, and are set to face Championship side Derby County in the last-eight in December. And Willian is hoping that the Blues can continue to progress in the competition, as he would love the opportunity to play at Wembley. Willian tangles with fellow South American Angel di Maria during the game at Old Trafford . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will be hoping that his side can maintain their unbeaten start against QPR . ‘I've never had the pleasure of playing there,' he added. 'I've been before when I went to see Brazil against England, and it was fantastic. It just made me even more determined to play there myself, and I hope that will be with Chelsea.’ Chelsea are going into their 10th Premier League game of the campaign against QPR on Saturday in the hopes of maintaining their unbeaten start to the season. And despite his side being heavy favourites for victory, Willian maintains there is no such thing as an easy game in the Premier League. ‘Every match is so, so difficult and, even when you play a team which is near the bottom of the league, you know to expect a tough game. But the mentality always has to be the same – we have to win.’","Willian says he is aiming to win every trophy on offer this season .

"James Rodriguez is the poster boy who has illuminated this World Cup with five goals and two assists in his opening four games, leaving Neymar, Messi and Ronaldo trailing in his wake. And while he may not have the same stellar profile of his La Liga peers, he has been raking it in with a series of glossy commercials. The 22-year-old has featured in adverts for Adidas, as well as Colombian beverage Pony Malta, shampoo brand Clear and Nestle drink Milo. VIDEO Scroll down for a collection of James Rodriguez commercials . Star: James Rodriguez has lit up the World Cup and been instrumental in Colombia's progress . Moment: Rodrguez's strike against Uruguay at the Maracana was one of the best in the tournament . Up and coming: Rodriguez as a 12-year-old lifting the trophy that set his career in motion. He was playing for Academia Tolimense in Colombia's traditional youth football tournament Ponyfutbol in 2004 when he scored a goal directly from a corner as he led his team to win the title . In an interview given in Spanish with Colombia's Suso's Show last year, Rodriguez talked about his younger days in Buenos Aires, when he didn't even have enough money for a long phone call back home to his parents. 'My parents were always very supportive with me,' he said. 'The rest of my family as well. 'When I was 15 years old, I went to Buenos Aires, alone. It was hard, obviously, but when you want to be somebody in life, you must go and make some sacrifices. 'Back in those days, there wasn’t a lot of money, so when I called my parents to speak to them it was only for a minute. I was speaking to them and the phone call went off, because the money ended. I was sad when this happened. I missed home and family.' Transform energy: Rodriguez advertising Colombian drink Pony Malta . Serious: The Colombian rising star during one of his adverts for Adidas . After starting his career with Colombian team Envigado, Rodriguez moved to Buenos Aires in 2008 to play for Banfield. In 2010, Porto snapped up Rodriguez for £4.06million, a fee that seems like a bargain now, and he began to make a name for himself in Europe. It was in his third season, when Radamel Falcao had left to join Atletico Madrid and Rodriguez saw more playing time, that the 22-year-old really caught the eye. Last summer, Monaco paid £35.8million for Rodriguez's services, and now the Colombian is dreaming of another big move to Real Madrid to play alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. Before he came to Brazil and lit up the tournament, Rodriguez said: 'My first game for Colombia was against Bolivia, in 2011. I felt something wonderful, I felt proud, because I always wanted to play for my country and now I want to play in the World Cup. 'From my childhood the thing I remember the best is that I always wanted a ball, I was always thinking about playing football. It always was football. 'I always knew that my position would be attacking. I always wanted to score.' But Rodriguez's ability on the pitch is matched by his acting skills, if his adverts are anything to go by. Seeing clearly: Rodriguez advertises shampoo brand Clear in a dark studio . Ball control: Rodriguez heads the ball during his advert for Clear shampoo . In an advert for drink Pony Malta, Rodriguez shoots the ball at various targets on the streets of Porto and the advert eds with the slogan 'Transform your energy into attitude'. The 22-year-olds advert for Clear shampoo resembles an advert Ronaldo did for a shampoo. The scenery is dark with special lights that makes it seem like a lot of photographers are taking pictures of him. Rodriguez is wearing a shirt and on it is written ‘Clear’, the name of the shampoo. He enters a football field and starts to play. After the explanation of what the shampoo does, Rodriguez scores and celebrates and the crowd is also celebrating with him. Comercial Milo James Rodriguez from Sonido Azulado on Vimeo. Workout: The Monaco forward advertises for Nestle drink Milo . Through her paces: Rodriguez could have many more endorsements after his World Cup displays . His advert for Adidas miCoach begins with Rodriguez holding his football boots before inserting a special chip into the sole. He then trains with statistics and information on his performance flashing up on the screen. Rodriguez then watches the data back on an iPhone, and the slogan 'Proof that you are fast' ends the advert. There's no doubting he's fast, and with his excellent performances at this World Cup, there are many more endorsement deals awaiting the Colombian.","Rodriguez has been the star of the World Cup so far in Brazil .

"Around 1,000 anti-government demonstrators have stormed the Royal Thai army headquarters in Bangkok after a planned march to protest against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's ruling party on Friday. The protestors broke through a a padlocked perimeter fence before pouring into the compound and setting up a stage to hold a rally. Reports from the headquarters say the mob have now driven a truck into the quadrant of the army base and are staging a rally with a public announce system. They are calling for the overthrow of the regime after Yingluck survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote on Thursday. Anti-government protesters occupy the Thailand Army Headquarters after six days of protesting . The protesters have been marching in the capital for six days in opposition to their government's ruling party . Army spokesperson Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd said: 'They are inside the courtyard and have not entered any buildings.' The crowds have been allowed to remain in the compound by the army and are now staging an anti-government rally . Thousands of protesters are continuing to occupy and protest at strategic parts of the capital including the Finance Ministry and the US embassy . An Army spokesman confirmed the protesters broke a padlock at the gate of the . compound and then pushed their way inside today. Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd said: 'They are inside the courtyard and have not entered any buildings.' But armed forces on the ground are said to be standing by and letting the protestors have their say on the understanding that they do not break into any official buildings. The demonstrations that started on Sunday have raised fears of fresh political turmoil and instability in Thailand. They pose the biggest threat to Ms Yingluck's administration since she came to power in 2011. Groups . of protesters were scattered around Bangkok today. Some are still . occupying the Finance Ministry, which they stormed on Monday. Others are . holed up at a sprawling government office compound. Thai riot policemen guard at the Royal Thai Police headquarters where anti-government protesters have gathered . The demonstrations that started on Sunday have raised fears of fresh political turmoil and instability in Thailand . Activists are believed to be challenging the army to declare which side they will be on, if the government is defeated. The no-confidence vote has failed to pacify protesters . who accuse Yingluck of abusing her party's majority to push through laws . that strengthen the behind-the-scenes power of self-exiled brother and . former premier, Thaksin Shinawatra. Though the number of protesters appear to be dwindling since the start of the week, a hard-core had remained in the capital determined to target symbols of the 'Thaksin regime'. Yingluck has ruled out resigning or dissolving parliament. As the rallies drag on, questions are being raised about what lies ahead in a conflict that broadly pits urban middle classes against the mostly rural supporters of Thaksin, a divisive tycoon ousted in a 2006 military coup and central to Thailand's eight years of on-off turmoil. Anti-government protest leader Suthep . Thaugsuban vowed firm action earlier in the week but was unwilling to . say what that would be. He told Reuters news agency: 'The end game will happen in the next day or two. All will be revealed tomorrow night' Activists promised 'end game' action tonight after the Prime Minister   Yingluck Shinawatra survived a no-confidence vote . Yingluck Shinawatra on Thursday called on anti-government demonstrators to hold dialogue with the government, but so far they have refused . Government sources said they would not be provoked into a response which would jeopardise its legitimacy. Overnight, it has urged police and its supporters to avoid confronting demonstrators it says are running out of steam. 'The government will not instigate a violent situation because that is exactly what Suthep wants', said Udomdet Rattanasatein, a lawmaker from Yingluck's Puea Thai party. 'We will not be provoked.' A government spokesperson said they would not be provoked into violently disrupting the protest because that would be playing into the hands of the activists .","Activists marched on the army base after six days of protesting .

"A suburban Seattle couple who claimed a $90 million Powerball jackpot say they both will quit their jobs at Boeing and then travel, take care of their family and buy a new car. But perish the thought of Ferraris or other six-figure supercars. They've got their eye on a Subaru Forester. At a news conference Thursday, Lisa Quam said she took a break from cooking on Thanksgiving Day and ran to the grocery store with her husband to pick up a newspaper with the Black Friday ads and some pumpkin spice. Scroll down for video . Lucky pair: Lisa N. and Everett Quam of Auburn are the lucky winners of the $90 million Powerball ticket and said they will quit their jobs to travel and buy a Subaru .

I had never purchased a Powerball ticket before,' she said. Lisa Quam checked the numbers Sunday night. 'I yelled to my family, 'Get up here!' They all thought I was mad and angry about something.

"Sergio Aguero was booked for diving in the opening stages of Manchester City's trip to Southampton, despite Saints defender Jose Fonte making clear contact with him inside the penalty area. Referee Mike Jones booked the Argentine despite the appeal from City players, and the visitors had a right to feel aggrieved. Here, Sportsmail's resident refereeing expert Graham Poll gives his view on the decision. Jose Fonte makes clear contact with Sergio Aguero as the Argentine falls to the ground inside the box . Jones books Aguero as City players go to remonstrate with the official with Aguero pleading his innocence . Jamie Carragher said on Sky Sports at half-time: 'That could be one of the worst decision I have seen this season. How has he [the referee] missed that?' Mike Jones, often considered as the weakest member of the select group of referees, made one of the worst decisions of the season when he somehow missed Jose Fonte wipe Sergio Aguero out for a stonewall penalty. As if that was not bad enough Jones then rubbed salt in the wound by showing Aguerro a yellow card for diving! However, Manchester City won the match comfortably enough so does it really matter that Jones made such a blatant mistake – after all he is human? Well I think it does. Firstly Aguero has a yellow card to his name that, however wrong, cannot be over turned. He could end up being suspended for accumulating cautions. Next his booking will be recorded as simulation which will mar the Premier league statistics and be forever against Aguero’s record. So why did Jones make such a basic error and can he improve? His first decision of the game was a very good one but perhaps contributed to the error with the Aguero incident. When Victor Wanyama slid across Yaya Toure in just the seventh minute Jones, despite not having the best viewing angle, did not hesitate to give a free-kick and caution the Southampton player. This was despite Wanyama’s vehement denial that he had done anything wrong and had in fact played the ball. Other Southampton players pressurised Jones, querying his decision, perhaps hoping to influence the referee and get into his head early on. I think they succeeded. VIDEO Aguero is no cheat - Pellegrini . Aguero is clearly fouled inside the area by Fonte, but was booked for the dive inside the opening 10 minutes . Despite replays proving that Jones was 100 per cent correct to both award the free-kick and to caution Wanyama I think he doubted himself and so when called upon to make a big decision, a penalty kick, he got it wrong by doubting what he saw. Confidence is an important ingredient in good performances, whatever you are doing; if you are refereeing at the top level it is vital. Jones’ confidence has always been fragile which perhaps offers evidence as to why so many people question his ability to perform at this level. I question those who appoint him to such a high profile game, second versus third in the Premier League.","Sergio Aguero was brought down in the area by Jose Fonte early on .

"A newborn orangutan cuddles up and nestles in its mother’s arms as it enjoys a nice snooze in the sunshine. The little ape, less than a month old, appears to content in its mothers strong arms. The 18-year-old mother, Mali, poses for the camera with her baby at her home at Devon's Paignton Zoo. Motherly love: The baby girl snoozes in her mother's arms at Paignton Zoo in Devon . It was the first birth at the zoo for 18 years and workers are confident that the baby ape is a girl. Phil Knowling, a spokesperson for the zoo, said the the pair are doing well after the birth. He said: 'We are pretty sure it’s a girl. Keepers are 99.9 per cent sure that the baby, now a month old, is female. 'Mali and the baby are doing well. They have the largest of the orangutan islands and even have an off show den to themselves. On the brink: Orangutans are at risk because of human encroachment into their territory, notably by palm oil producers . 'We hope that visitors will be able to catch a glimpse of the youngster, which will become more mobile over the coming months.' The pair are Bornean orangutans and they have suffered declines where the population is estimated to just be 50,000. The baby will remain with its mother for up to 10 years - before it might move to another zoo as part of the European Endangered Species Programme. The expansion of oil palm plantations into high conservation value forests in their natural habitat is recognised as a leading threat to critically endangered species including orangutans, elephants and tigers. As well as being cute, the baby girl will most likely be smart too - orangutans are regarded as the most intelligent of the primates. They are known for being able to use a wide variety of sophisticated tools and make elaborate nests to sleep in. Experts have extensively studied the species for their learning capability. Bornean orangutans, which are native to the island of Borneo, belongs to the only genus of great apes native to Asia. They share around 97 per cent of their DNA with humans. Bornean orangutans live in tropical and subtropical forests in lowland and mountainous areas of Borneo. The species lives in the tree canopy and moves large distances in search of food. As well as the destruction of their natural habitat, they are also killed for the 'bushmeat trade,' while young orangutans are sometimes caught to be sold as pets. Around 55,000 Borean orangutans live in the wild, and a number are in preservation programmes throughout the world .","Pictures show mother Mali and her month-old baby girl at a Devon zoo .

"Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu will boycott the Ballon d'Or ceremony in protest at the transfer ban imposed upon the Catalan club by FIFA. The Catalans are not allowed to make any signings in the next two transfer windows because of a breach of rules relating to the signing of international players under the age of 18. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld FIFA's ruling after the Spanish giants failed with an appeal to overturn the ban, with Barcelona still relentlessly contesting the charge. Josep Bartomeu (above) will not attend the Ballon d'Or ceremony in wake of transfer ban . Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona was allowed while the club appealed against the ban on new signings, which is now in force after the CAS upheld the original sanction imposed by FIFA . Bartomeu has contacted Sepp Blatter to inform the FIFA president of his intended absence from the January 12 award ceremony and insists the club are to sever all ties with the governing body for the duration of the ban. 'FIFA has not told us who made the original charge and during the period of the sanction we will not maintain any institutional relations with them,' Bartomeu said at a press conference. 'I have sent a stern letter to Sepp Blatter and I will not be attending the Fifa Ballon d'Or gala set for January 12. Barcelona are not allowed to sign players for the next two transfer windows . Bartomeu said relations with FIFA will cease to exist during the period of the sanction . 'This is not the end of the matter. I foresee the Barca case becoming a watershed in the football world, just like the Bosman case. However long it lasts, we will not lose this case.'

"The family of American photojournalist Luke Somers held captive in Yemen broke their silence Thursday, releasing a video to plead for mercy after US officials confirmed they had tried and failed to rescue him. The brief YouTube clip featuring Somers’ brother, Jordan, and his mother, Paula Somers, came out just hours after al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate released their own video, threatening to kill the British-born journalist in three days' time unless the US government meets several demands. Somers, 33, was captured on September 17, 2013, in Yemen's capital of Sana'a. Scroll down for videos . Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said it will murder British-born hostage Luke Somers, pictured, within three days unless the United States agrees to a range of demands. Mr Somers was kidnapped in Yemen . Begging for mercy: Luke's brother, Jordan (left), and his mother, Paula Somers (right), released a video Thursday asking his al Qaeda captors to release him . 'Up to this point, we have no explanation as to why Luke was targeted as a victim, and we currently don't know why he's being held,' Jordan Somers says into the camera, directly addressing his brother's captors. 'Luke has spent the last two years making Yemen his home. He's a good person and he's only been trying to do good things for the Yemeni population. 'He goes out of his way to care for, and respects, the common person and he has made many lasting friends in Yemen.' Jordan Somers then goes on to claim that their family were unaware of the failed special operations raid on a cave in Yemen intended to liberate Luke. 'Luke is only a photojournalist and he is not responsible for any actions the US government has taken,' he says. 'Please understand that we had no prior knowledge of the rescue attempt for Luke, and we mean no harm to anyone.' The hostage's mother, Paula Somers, then speaks, thanking the al Qaeda group for taking a good care of Luke and keeping him healthy. 'Please, show mercy and give us an opportunity to see our Luke again; he is all that we have,' she says into the camera. 'Luke, if you are able to hear or see us, please know that we're doing everything possible to help you. Our hearts are with you, we miss you and we love you, and all we want to do is see you again and have you safely in our arms, all together again,' the mother concludes. Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement Thursday that eight days ago, special forces raided a cave complex in Yemen to free a number of hostages. Some of the captives were rescued, but others, among them Somers, were not present at the targeted location. Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, senior official in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, pictured, spoke for two minutes and thirty seconds during the video where he threatened to kill Mr Somers within three days . White House spokesman Bernadette Meehan said the mission was coordinated with the Yemeni government and carried out by a group including both American special operations forces and Yemeni military. 'The overriding concern for Mr. Somers' safety and the safety of the U.S. forces who undertake these missions made it imperative that we not disclose information related to Mr. Somers' captivity and the attempted rescue,' Meehan said, adding that the White House's 'thoughts remain with the Somers family. Meehan said the mission was being disclosed now because of the video released Thursday. The video was released this morning by the Al Malahem Media Center, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's propaganda arm, and discovered by the SITE Intelligence Group which monitors terrorist activity online. Mr Somers moved from London to Sana'a, Yemen in 2011 to become a teacher, but soon started taking pictures of public demonstrations and established himself as a photojournalist working for the Yemen Times . In this Monday, February 11, 2013 photo, Luke Somers poses for a picture during a parade marking the second anniversary of the revolution in Sanaa, Yemen . The broadcast features Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, who is a senior official in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Ansi warns President Obama that unless he accepts the terror group's demands, 'the American hostage held by us will meet his inevitable fate'. During the video, Ansi does not cover his face and is seen reading from a script in Arabic which accuses America of committing crimes against Muslims. Ansi remains vague about what specific demands need to be met by the U.S. government to ensure Somers' release, but says the Americans are 'aware' of the list. Unlike previous videos produced by ISIS and the Al Hayat Media Center, Mr Somers is not wearing an orange jump suit nor is he threatened with any form of weapon on screen. During the video, Mr Somers addresses the camera, saying: 'My name is Luke Somers. I'm 33 years old. I was born in England, but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life. 'It's now been well over a year since I've been kidnapped in Sana'a. Basically, I'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I'm certain that my life is in danger. 'So as I sit here now, I ask if anything can be done, please let it be done. Thank you very much.' 'It's now been well over a year since I've been kidnapped in Sana'a. Basically, I'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I'm certain that my life is in danger,' Mr Somers says in the video . American commandos tried to rescue Mr Somers in a raid on an AQAP camp late last month, but he had been moved by the time they arrived . The video was released eight days after American commandos carried out a raid on an AQAP camp, in an attempt to rescue Mr Somers. The raid took place on a cave complex in the remote Hadhramaut province where locals give terrorist cells safe haven. But by the time members of SEAL Team Six, the elite unit that killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011, raided the AQAP camp on November 26, he had already been moved. However, the special forces recovered a group of eight hostages including six Yemenis, a Saudi Arabian and an Ethiopian. One of the hostages rescued in the raid allegedly reported that Mr Somers may have been moved out with another group of prisoners two days before the raid took place. Mr Somers was believed to be a part of a group which included citizens from Britain, South Africa and Turkey. The New York Times reports that A Yemeni electricity company worker named Rasheed al-Habishi was also expected to be in Mr Somers' camp. On Thursday, his son told the Times that his father's dead body had been found in a town near where the raid took place. The Pentagon initially asked members of the media not to report on the raid, for fear it would jeopardize Mr Somers' life, but the story leaked anyway. It is understood that Mr Somers moved to Sana'a from London in 2010 to work as a teacher. However, he soon started taken photographs of anti-government protests in the city and established himself as a photojournalist working for the Yemen Times. Mr Somers was kidnapped in the Yemeni capital Sana'a in September 2013 by an Al Qaeda affiliate . Mr Somers also worked as a translator and as a freelance photographer, with his pictures appearing on websites like the BBC. The National Yemen newspaper published an article about Mr Somers this week, saying he was 'known as the most active photojournalist at Change Square' - a protest site at the center of Yemen's 2011 rebellion against former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. However, not much else has been said about Mr Somers, especially about his life before moving to Yemen. The U.S. government tries not to publicize the kidnapping of citizens, in an attempt to shield them from hostage situations like this. The three-minute video also features Ansi speaking about American activity in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq as well as recent air strikes in Syria. It follows similar videos by ISIS, which has already killed two British hostages and three American hostages in videos released on social media. Rival terror group ISIS has threatened to murder British journalist John Cantlie, pictured . ISIS has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig and two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning. Footage claiming to show Mr Henning's murder appeared on the internet just days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq. And official figures suggest around 500 Britons have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIS, while others have joined up with Kurdish groups to fight against the militants. The government last month announced a raft of new anti-extremist measures, including ensuring insurance companies can no longer foot the bill for terrorist ransoms, suspected foreign fighters will be blocked from returning to the UK and powers will be reintroduced to relocate terror suspects across the country.","Luke Somers, 33, was kidnapped in the Yemeni capital in September 2013 .

"When we feel ill, most of us ring the doctor or reach for a paracetamol. But former EastEnders star Michelle Collins embraces a far more unconventional approach when it comes to her health. The 51-year-old actress uses homeopathy - an alternative medicine - to treat her ailments and says she has been an advocate for almost 20 years. Flower power: Former EastEnders star Michelle Collins embraces an unconventional approach towards her health, opting for homeopathy over traditional medicines . Miss Collins also praises the ‘mind and body’ aspect of homeopathy and claims that it is especially helpful when dealing with stage fright and nerves. She was introduced to homeopathy - a practice that was discovered around 200 years ago and that treats symptoms with a ‘like for like’ approach - when her daughter Maia was born as a natural way of treating teething, chesty coughs and colds. And her daughter, now 17, still uses homeopathy, Miss Collins said. She continued: ‘Maia is soon off to university and still using homeopathy herself for anxiety when dealing with exam stress and hay fever.’ Miss Collins, who also starred in EastEnders’ rival soap Coronation Street for three years, said that homeopathy makes her feel more in control of her body and added: ‘I am passionate about personalised and approachable healthcare. ‘Homeopathy treats the individual as a whole, taking into account mind and body, which is important.’ Overcoming her nerves: Miss Collins also praises the 'mind and body' aspect of homeopathy and claims that it is especially helpful when dealing with stage fright and nerves . Miss Collins, who is currently starring . in The Glass Supper at the Hampstead Theatre in London, added: ‘I was . getting anxious about the opening and it [homeopathy] really helped . settle my nerves and keep my concentration.’ The actress has admitted to previously suffering from depression following her departure from EastEnders and splitting from Maia’s father, Fabrizio Tassalini. She said the pressure and stress got so much that she even attempted to take her own life while filming the BBC drama Sunburn in 1998. Tough times: The actress has admitted to previously suffering from depression following her departure from EastEnders and splitting from her daughter's father, Fabrizio Tassalini . Miss . Collins has said she has never attempted anything like that since and that . homeopathy should be more widely available on the NHS. Homeopathy is a system of medicine which involves treating a patient with highly diluted substances, aiming to trigger the body’s natural system of healing.It is based on a series of ideas developed in the 1790s by a German doctor called Samuel Hahnemann.Some of the most common conditions homeopathy is used to cure are asthma, mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety, dermatitis and arthritis.Remedies are made from plants - such as jasmine or witch-hazel, metals, minerals and chemicals. She added: ‘Homeopathy is very important to healthy living. It empowers you to take control of your health. ‘The NHS should be looking to things like this to help manage spiralling costs as it is soinexpensive and effective, plus conventional drugs can have horrible side-effects which make things worse.’ According to the British Homeopathic Association, one in eight Brits use homeopathy but the organisation, who Miss Collins has recently become an ambassador for, also said that the majority of the nation know very little about it as a complementary medicine. Homeopathy was discovered by German doctor Samuel Hahnemann, who was shocked at the harsh medical practices of his day and the harsh side effects. His aim was to find an alternative approach and he believed that by using highly diluted substances the body could potentially heal itself. Cristal Sumner, Chief Executive of the British Homeopathic Association, added: ‘We are thrilled to have Michelle on board, she is passionate about healthy living and has used homeopathy for years. ‘She is a household name, an amazing talent and someone we know will bring awareness of homeopathy to a new and greater audience.’ Taking control: Miss Collins, who also starred in EastEnders' rival soap Coronation Street for three years, said that homeopathy makes her feel more in control of her body .

"Caution: Socially mobile Pippa Middleton at Queen's Club watching the tennis . As the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister, she is guaranteed a place on every guest list in town. But Pippa Middleton has been quietly asked by Kate and Prince William to scale back her public appearances, The Mail on Sunday has learned. The 29-year-old is being encouraged to lower her profile amid concerns that she is leaving herself open to criticism. Last week, she was seen in Wimbledon’s Royal Box and at Sir David Frost’s annual summer party, where she mingled with guests including Stephen Fry, Sir Elton John and Sir Bruce Forsyth. She has also written for this week’s edition of The Spectator, is a contributing editor at Vanity Fair and has a monthly column in Waitrose Food Illustrated. But friends of Prince Harry have now revealed that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are advising caution. The friend said: ‘Pippa has been asked to tone it down. 'Kate and William didn’t want her to write her party planning book Celebrate, let alone a regular column in various magazines. ‘They have spoken to her about this.’ Pippa has since tried to cut back on the number of public events she attends.

It is a second regular magazine job for the aspiring lifestyle guru, which she will write in addition to her monthly Friday Night Feasts column in Waitrose Magazine.  It follows the publication of her first book, Celebrate: A Year of British Festivities for Family and Friends, last year. Sisterly advice: The Duchess of Cambridge with her sister Pippa Middleton (left) at Wimbledon last year . Published ahead of Wimbledon this year, the article sees Pippa describe the tournament as 'the highlight of my summer', and recalls her first visit to the All England Club at the age of eight. She says that she was an aspiring professional tennis player at the time, and remembers purchasing a postcard of the women's championship trophy and writing on it: 'I will win this one day.' She admits that as a child, she imagined she would get married in tennis whites, 'shorts with no pleats or frills.' Pippa, who is dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, 35, tells readers that she has now grown out of her tomboy phase, but that said, there will still be 'no white dresses this summer, apart from at my local tennis club.' She says a favourite Wimbledon memory was queuing with her sister on People's Sunday in 2004 to get £35 tickets for Centre Court - something that would be highly unlikely - and indeed unnecessary for them today.","Pippa has been ubiquitous at high profile social events this summer .

"Lionel Messi's vow to the late Tito Vilanova on his deathbed is why the Argentine superstar remains at the Nou Camp, former Barcelona assistant Henk ten Cate has claimed. The Dutch coach, who worked under Frank Rijkaard when Messi debuted at the club in 2004, said Messi promised close confidant Vilanova that he would stay at the Catalan giants. Ten Cate spoke to Holland's De Telegraaf amid speculation Messi is unhappy and looking to move elsewhere due to a rift with current boss Luis Enrique. Lionel Messi, who came off the bench against Real Sociedad, is said to be unhappy at Barcelona . Former Barca assistant Henk ten Cate says Messi is only at the Catalan club due to a promise to Tito Vilanova . Messi looks back at the late Vilanova (left) as he replaces Cesc Fabregas at the Nou Camp in 2013 . 'Messi is only still at Barcelona because he promised it to Tito Vilanova at his deathbed,' Ten Cate told De Telegraaf, adding there were signs of problems two years ago. Messi shared a close relationship with Vilanova, who stepped up to the main job at Barcelona in 2012 and together they won the La Liga on their first try. Vilanova stepped down due to ill health and died from cancer in April last year. Despite Messi apparently giving Vilanova his word, Ten Cate believes a move would be the best thing for both parties. Messi (second left)  started on the bench against Sociedad on Sunday but came on at half-time . Messi shakes hands with Sociedad manager David Moyes after the final whistle in San Sebastian . ""I think a transfer would be in everybody's best interest,' Ten Cate says. 'Lionel has been at Barcelona for quite a while and he needs a new challenge. He's still worth a lot of money now but his value will only go down from here on.' Messi didn't train on Monday, citing gastroenteritis, but returned on Wednesday. At a press conference Enrique refused to 'confirm or deny those reports' in relation to a clash with Messi and other senior players. 'Messi is the best player in the world and I have said this many times,' he said. 'I have the same relationship with all my players that I had at the start of the season.' Barcelona boss Luis Enrique says Messi is the best player in the world and their relationship is unchanged . Dutch coach Henk ten Cate was Frank Rijkaard's assistant at Barca when Messi debuted at the club in 2004 . Although Barcelona sit just one point from Real Madrid in the league, the club is enduring a tumultuous time behind the scenes. Messi started on the bench in the 1-0 loss to David Moyes' Real Sociedad on Sunday. Sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta has now been shown the door while club legend Carles Puyol, who was his assistant, also left. Club presidential elections have also been brought forward to the summer in a bid to 'reduce the tension at the club', said Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who confirmed he would run. Bartomeu also said Enrique would not be sacked.","Lionel Messi made promise to Tito Vilanova he'd stay, says Henk ten Cate .

"The news that Alan Pardew has quit Newcastle United to become manager at his former club Crystal Palace rocked football on Monday. Pardew will sign a four-year contract, worth around £2m-a-season, after a compensation package was thrashed out between the two clubs. As Pardew prepares to leave Toon, Sportsmail's Craig Hope gauged the reaction to his departure on the streets of Newcastle. And with the likes of Tim Sherwood, Tony Pulis, Eddie Howe, Steve McClaren and Steve Bruce in the frame to replace Pardew, we ask the fans who they would like to see come in. Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse leaves the club's training ground as the news sinks in that Pardew is to leave the club. Cisse accepted an FA charge of violent conduct for elbowing Everton defender Seamus Coleman . Pardew ducked the post-match press conference after Newcastle's 3-2 victory against Everton on Sunday and agreed to move to Selhurst Park once the clubs reached a deal. The 53-year-old boss has faced various campaigns calling for his resignation or dismissal by sections of Newcastle supporters throughout his turbulent reign at the club. Owner Mike Ashley, who did not attend the victory over Everton, has been plotting his next move from his holiday retreat in Barbados. The billionaire is wary of the upheaval when his manager quits the club and will also need to find a replacement prepared to work under his demanding ways. Pardew, who has a property in Surrey a short distance from Palace’s Beckenham HQ, is known to be frustrated after being told at a Newcastle transfer meeting four weeks ago that there would be no money to spend in January. Instead there is the possibility that Moussa Sissoko will leave in January after Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain declared an interest in the France midfielder. Newcastle's Chieck Tiote pictured at the club's training ground on Tuesday . Newcastle United's development manager Peter Beardsley pictured at the club's training ground on Tuesday . Newcastle are ninth in the Barclays Premier League following the victory over Everton and Ashley is happy with the team’s progress following their poor start to the season. Pardew, who wanted to progress and challenge for honours, expected Ashley to make funds available to strengthen the team. Instead the Newcastle owner, who had an excellent relationship with his manager, appears content with the current squad. Pardew, who  scored the winner in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool in 1990, is currently at his family home in Surrey. Reaction was mixed on the streets of Newcastle, with some fans saying Pardew was harshly treated and others saying it was the correct decision to leave . Sportsmail asked Newcastle fans for their reaction to Pardew's departure and who should replace him . Pardew has left Newcastle United after four years to become the manager of Crystal Palace . Pardew became Newcastle United manager in December 2010 and was on an eight-year contract . Meanwhile, Papiss Cisse has accepted a Football Association charge of violent conduct following his elbow on EVerton's Seamus Coleman on Sunday. The striker will now await confirmation of a three-game ban. With Cisse expected to play with Senegal in the Africa Cup of Nations next month, he could miss seven matches for Newcastle. A Newcastle statement read: 'Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse has accepted a charge of violent conduct from the Football Association. 'Cisse was involved in an incident involving Everton's Seamus Coleman during the Barclays Premier League fixture at St James' Park on Sunday December 28. 'Cisse has accepted the charge and will now serve a three-match suspension, which starts with immediate effect.'

"Veteran: Former Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning, pictured in 1997, has admitted 26 counts of indecent assault and three of gross indecency . One of the founding DJs of  BBC Radio 1 admitted sexually abusing 19 boys as young as nine yesterday. Chris Denning, 73, pleaded guilty to dozens of offences of indecent assault and gross indecency. One victim was molested in 1967, the year the DJ’s career took off when he joined the opening line-up for the flagship radio station. Denning worked alongside stars including Tony Blackburn, Kenny Everett, Terry Wogan and John Peel. He was included in the line-up for a famous photograph with a host of BBC stars outside Broadcasting House that year. Yesterday the former DJ, who is in poor health, admitted 29 offences during a hearing at Southwark Crown Court. In a grey tracksuit and blue striped T-shirt, he clutched the side of the dock as he stood up to enter his pleas. Denning hung his head but spoke in a clear voice. The sex attacks took place on boys aged between nine and 16, between July 1967 and December 1984. Denning is accused of abusing 22 victims in total, but he denied 12 other allegations relating to six of the boys. These include one of gross indecency with a child and eight of indecent assault on a male person.As a result Judge Alistair McCreath ordered that he go on trial on November 24 and remanded him in custody. The court heard Denning is frail and suffers from a number of illnesses including Parkinson’s disease and diabetes. He suffered a heart attack in 2009 and struggles to walk after fracturing his spine. Denning was arrested in April last year by detectives from Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile paedophile scandal. Scroll down for video .

His prosecution follows those of other celebrities such as Rolf Harris, Max Clifford and Dave Lee Travis, who faces a retrial in September. Denning left his London grammar school aged 15 and began his radio career at Radio Moscow after talking his way into the studios while on holiday. As a young man he boasted of being a . globetrotter who drove to India and broadcast from France, Germany, . Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal  and Czechoslovakia. He went on to work for Radio  Luxembourg . and Radio London before presenting Where It’s At  with Kenny Everett on . the BBC’s Light Programme. Abuse: Denning, 73, pleaded guilty to dozens of offences of indecent assault and gross indecency, and admitted sexually abusing 19 boys as young as nine . The former DJ admitted: . 26 counts of indecent assault . Three counts of gross indecency to a child. But denied: . Two counts of sexual assault . One of gross indecency with a child . Eight of indecent assault on a male person . One of attempted sexual assault . In 1964 he was a BBC2 announcer whose voice was the first heard when the TV channel took to the air. Three years later he became one of the original DJs on BBC Radio 1, where he continued presenting Where It’s At, had his own weekly show and deputised for Tony Blackburn. Denning left Radio 1 in 1969 and worked for record label Decca for  two years. He is said to have worked as a music producer for The Beatles and helped launch the careers of the Bay City Rollers and Gary Glitter. Over the years he has lived in Bracknell, Berkshire, Addlestone and  Weybridge in Surrey, and Teddington in South London. During that time he ran his own music and video production business, before moving overseas and spending time in the Far East. When he was arrested last year, Denning was staying at a hostel for the homeless in East London. Denning, 73, of Basildon in Essex, appeared at Southwark Crown Court today and was remanded in custody .

"A mother who thought her newborn son simply had hiccups was horrified to be told he was having a stroke. Archie Lyall was only a few hours old when he suffered a neonatal stroke which left him at risk of cerebral palsy and other debilitating conditions. As he was lying in his hospital cot on Boxing Day 2012, his mother Helen Bunker him twitching, but mistakenly dismissed it as hiccups. Danger: Archie Lyall, now 18 months (pictured with mother Helen), was only a few hours old when he suffered a neonatal stroke which left him at risk of cerebral palsy . But when midwives asked her how long Archie had been twitching, they became concerned - and a brain wave analysis confirmed he had suffered a stroke. Ms Bunker said: 'It was a really scary time, especially with Archie being our first child. 'A couple of hours after he was born, the midwife came round and pointed at his chest and asked me how long he’d been doing the twitching. 'I’d thought it was just hiccups, so she told me to tell her if it happened again. 'But an hour later, my partner Lee noticed he was doing it again.' Archie was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit at Hull and East Yorkshire Women’s and Children’s Hospital before Helen and Lee had even taken a photo. Brave: Archie has since made a recovery and hit all his development milestones . Instead, one the nurses kindly took one for the devastated couple and brought it down to them. Ms Bunker, from Hull, said: 'Archie had wires and tubes all over him and all sorts of machines attached to his body. 'He had monitors on his brain. When he twitched, he looked perfectly normal - like nothing much was happening - but on the machine, his brain waves were going ten to the dozen. 'He had an MRI scan and that’s when they told us he’d had a neonatal stroke.' Once Archie was well enough to leave hospital, he was given medication and his parents were told to watch his development closely. This is because not hitting any of the normal baby milestones - such as recognising faces and learning to crawl - could be a sign the stroke had had a lasting effect. But 18 months on, Archie has finally made a full recovery, to his family's relief. Fight: Archie in hospital. Doctors say newborns have a higher risk of as stroke as their blood is thicker . This week, consultants finally signed him off and said he would not need any more appointments. His mother said: 'The doctor told us us he was completely fine and he was doing everything a normal baby should be. 'When she said that would be our last appointment, and there shouldn’t be any problems in future, we were so happy. 'It’s a day we’ve been looking forward to since we found out he’d had the stroke. 'It was such a relief. It felt like a big weight had been lifted off our shoulders. 'He's now doing all the things a little boy should and is really showing his cheeky personality.' Stroke in the first 28 days of life is more common than parents realise. In fact newborns have as high a risk of stroke as the elderly, according to The Hospital for Sick Children, in Canada. Newborns are at risk of a stroke for a number of reasons. Proteins passed through the placenta can increase the risk of clots - and therefore stroke. If a clot travels to through the bloodstream to the brain, it can cause a stroke. Pressure on the arteries and veins in the head during childbirth can also lead to a clot forming. Newborn babies also have thicker blood - another risk factor for a clot. Symptoms of a neonatal stroke include: . Repetitive facial movements, including sucking, chewing, or eye movements . Rhythmic jerking movements involving the muscles of the face, tongue, arms, legs, or other regions . Quick, single jerks involving one arm or leg or the whole body . Unusual bicycling or pedaling movements . Pauses in breathing associated with slowing of the heart . Staring .

"Russian diplomats say the unnamed 17-year-old was 'seduced' by a homosexual couple in a church (file picture) An Russian high school student has found himself at the centre of diplomatic storm after he was adopted by a same-sex couple while on an exchange programme to the U.S. It is thought that the unnamed 17-year-old sought asylum in America because he is gay, following a surge in homosexual Russians migrating to the U.S. because of strict 'propaganda' laws legislated by Moscow in 2013. But the Russian government claims the boy was 'illegally' put up for adoption, and that he was 'seduced' by an older gay couple that he met at church. The mother of the boy travelled to Michigan, where he was studying, earlier this year in an apparent attempt to persuade him to come home. Lisa Coate, vice president of the organisation that runs the exchange programme, said the U.S. 'funded [the mother's] trip to allow her to speak to her son and tell him whatever she wanted to tell him', but the boy decided to stay put. The state-run Tass news agency said Russian diplomats had visited the boy, and found that the 17-year-old was 'seduced' by 'a pair of old homosexuals at church, former military men who had already adopted two American boys, and they offered to become his sponsor and even pay for his studies at Harvard University'. It was at this point that the boy handed himself over to immigration authorities, seeking asylum. The student had been due to return to Russia in the Spring of this year, but the country's authorities only made the case public this week. Russia's children's commissioner Pavel Astakhov said: 'A child, who has a mother in Russia, has illegally been placed under guardianship, and the boy has been handed over to a U.S. gay couple. 'The child hails from a decent family and is healthy so it's unclear what arguments those in the United States have been guided by.' The boy's attorney, Susan Reed, of the Michigan Immigrants Rights Center, told BuzzFeed that the Russian authorities were 'completely mischaracterising' what had happened, but gave no further details. Russia's children's commissioner Pavel Astakhov said it was unclear why the U.S. granted asylum to the boy as he 'hails from a decent family and is healthy' U.S. Ambassador to Moscow John F. Tefft said he regretted the Russian Government's decision to cancel the exchange programme (file picture) The spat has led to Russia cancelling the long-standing pupil exchange programme amid wider tensions between the two nations. The Future Leaders Exchange Program (FLEX) sponsored high school students from former Soviet countries to come to the U.S. to study. At least 15 Russian students have refused to return home since the programme's inception in 1993. Konstantin Dolgov, from the Kremlin's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: 'An unacceptable situation emerged as a result, when our [Russian] school students were in fact subjected to the legislature of American states, where minors were able to choose on their own and without their parents’ permission their place for living or being adopted'. U.S. Ambassador John F. Tefft responded in a statement via the Moscow embassy’s website. It read: 'We deeply regret this decision by the Russian government to end a programme that for 21 years has built deep and strong connections between the people of Russia and the United States.' Since the so-called 'homosexual propoganda' law came into effect in Russia in 2013, there has been a surge in citizens seeking asylum in countries with more equal rights for gay people, including the U.S.. The two countries were at loggerheads in 2012 after U.S. barred entry to all suspected human rights abusers, leading Russia to ban all adoptions of Russian children by Americans, as well as any other nations that allow gay marriages.","Russian student sought asylum in U.S. after finishing exchange programme .

"Becoming a mother makes women better at their jobs, according to a new study . It is a finding that will come as no surprise to mothers who are used to doing ten things at once while looking after their children. Because a study says becoming a mother makes women better at their job. The research indicates that raising a child improves the essential workplace skills of female workers. Nearly two thirds of working mums (62 per cent) say they become better at multi-tasking after having children. Nearly half (46 per cent) feel their time management improves, and around a quarter (27 per cent) become more organised. The research, carried out for Microsoft, asked 2,000 women and 500 employers how their performance had changed due to becoming a mother. And it seems employers agree, with more than half (57 per cent) saying mothers make better team players than women who do not have children. Nearly a third (29 per cent) see their employee’s team work improve after they give birth, while 35 per cent say their multi-tasking skills get better. One in three (34 per cent) also appreciate their colleagues and clients more when they become a mother, according to their bosses. The study also shows technology is playing a huge part helping mothers juggle their homelife with their work. More than a third (37 per cent) of working mums use technology to work from home when they cannot get into the office. The advancements in social media and new gadgets appear to help mothers every day. Researchers also found technology is playing a huge part helping mothers juggle their homelife with their work . New technology allows a third (29 per cent) to cram an extra 60 minutes in their busy daily schedule.And 23 per cent say they even manage to pack in an extra two hours. As a result, a quarter of mums (25 per cent) claim they are twice as productive as their husband or boyfriend. Skincare business owner and mother-of-five Liz Earle said women have an important role in the workplace. The 51-year-old said: 'The research findings are indicative of changes I have seen in business over the last decade. 'Mothers work wonders both in the house and home as they become an increasingly important resource to all those around them. 'I think businesses are becoming more accommodating for mothers. 'New technologies are saving time and making our lives easier in all sorts of ways, from keeping in touch with colleagues and friends to finding out where the closest baby-changing room is.' Celine Naude from Microsoft said: 'I couldn’t agree more with the research findings. My friends, family members and colleagues that are mums never cease to amaze me with their ability to achieve the unachievable on a daily basis. 'As a mum-to-be I’m inspired by these women and proud to be part of the Office 365 campaign which is all about celebrating those who work wonders.'","Becoming a mother makes women better at their job, says a new study .

"Peter Clarke had food poisoning caused by campylobacter bacteria . Peter . Clarke had invited his 19-year-old grandson, Cai, over for a meal and . had made a special effort with the menu, starting with home-made . vegetable soup, which was followed by roast chicken breast with new . potatoes and peas, then chocolate mousse. 'I see quite a bit of Cai . because he studies at university in Cardiff, which is where I live,' says  79-year-old Peter, a retired consultant structural engineer who . lives alone. 'I enjoy cooking when it's not just for me.' But that . night in February left Peter with a nasty stomach bug that kept him . housebound for nearly a week and led to him losing 9lb in just a few . days. He had contracted a campylobacter infection - and is thought to have caught it when he washed the chicken before cooking it. It was something he, like nearly half of the population, had always done, little realising how risky it could be for health. Yesterday . the Food Standards Agency  (FSA) warned people to stop washing chicken . before they cook it because of the risk of spreading the deadly . bacteria. Campylobacter bacteria are the most common cause of food . poisoning in the UK, affecting an estimated 280,000 Britons a year - and . are to blame for more cases than E.coli, salmonella and listeria put . together. 'Often people don't report their symptoms, so the true . number of cases is likely to be even higher,' says Bob Martin, a . microbiologist and head of food-borne diseases strategy at the FSA. Around . 80 per cent of these cases have been traced to contaminated poultry - . it's thought that two‑thirds of chicken carries the bacteria, says  Mr . Martin. Laboratory tests on samples from infected people have found . they contain the same campylobacter DNA found specifically in chicken. Other sources of the bacteria include raw meat, unpasteurised milk and . untreated water. Campylobacter is said to never be more than 3ft from . a chicken shed, he says, adding that the FSA is working with the . poultry supply industry in the UK to reduce the amount of the bacteria . on chicken. But a key problem is that many of us are unwittingly . spreading it by washing raw chicken. As many as 44 per cent of . people always wash chicken before cooking it, according to the FSA - . usually because they think it gets rid of germs or the blood. Washing . raw chicken seems to be something you either do or don't do, 'perhaps . depending if your parents did it', adds Dr Katie Laird, a microbiologist . at De Montfort University in Leicester. Scroll down for video . Caught common food poisoning bug after washing a chicken before cooking it . The problem is that . droplets of water carrying campylobacter, and other bugs such as . salmonella, can splash onto hands, work surfaces, sinks, clothing, . cooking equipment such as chopping boards, sponges and cloths - and even . other food that isn't then cooked, such as salad. 'We know the droplets from  washing chicken under a kitchen  tap can travel up to a metre,' says Mr Martin. And just a few campylobacter cells are needed to cause disease and food poisoning, adds Dr Laird. This . won't occur as soon as you've eaten the contaminated foods - it can . take between one and five days before you start feeling unwell. The . symptoms are caused when the bacteria reach the . epithelial cells that line the stomach - 'they have a toxic effect in us . which triggers inflammation, and that causes symptoms,' explains Dr . Laird. In around half of the cases, the illness starts with 24-hour . flu-like symptoms. It progresses to profuse diarrhoea that can contain . blood, vomiting, abdominal pains and cramps that may resemble . appendicitis. Typically, it lasts around a week. 'It is a severe illness that you don't get over after a day,' adds Mr Martin. Drinking . water helps, as this replaces the fluids lost through vomiting and . diarrhoea - the body's ability to fight the bug is compromised if it is . dehydrated. The worry is that in around a quarter of patients, the . bacteria can trigger a number of conditions, such as irritable bowel . syndrome (IBS). 'This is due to an irreversible change in the lining of the gut,' says  Mr Martin. This can last for years in some cases. One possible cause is a toxin produced by the bacteria - research has shown this can disrupt bowel function. The . infection may also damage nerves lining the gut, responsible for gut . motility (the normal movement of waste through the system) and . sensation, leading to altered bowel movements and increased awareness of . pain in the gastro-intestinal tract. In around 1 per cent of cases, . campylobacter can trigger 'reactive' arthritis, which is usually short . term but can sometimes become chronic, says Mr Martin. Here, inflammation - redness and swelling - are triggered in response to an infection. This . most commonly affects the joints (leading to pain and stiffness), the . eyes (causing conjunctivitis) and the urethra (leading to pain when . urinating). The joint pain typically comes on two to four weeks after the infection has passed. Another more alarming condition, Guillain-Barre  syndrome, is strongly linked to campylo- bacter.Although . rare, it usually occurs after a viral or bacterial infection, which may . trigger the immune system to attack nerve roots and peripheral nerves, . causing partial paralysis and sometimes even death. Around 1,200 people a . year suffer from it. While anyone can get campylobacter food . poisoning or the serious complications, the under-fives and over-60s are . at a slightly increased risk because their immune systems tend to be . weaker, says Mr Martin. There is no reason to clean chicken or wash off visible blood - it doesn't make it any more hygienic . Taking medications that affect production of stomach acid can also make you more vulnerable to a campylobacter infection. For . instance, those taking proton pump inhibitors, which reduce the . production of stomach acid, might be more susceptible because the acid . in the stomach can kill the bacteria. Usually drinking lots of water . and taking oral rehydration salts to avoid dehydration, resting and . eating easily digested foods if you feel up to it is enough to treat a . campylobacter infection. Antibiotics may be prescribed if symptoms are . severe. If the symptoms last more than a couple of days or are . particularly severe, such as blood being present in the stools, see your . GP or call the 111 helpline if you're worried about leaving the house, . adds Mr Martin. The consequences of washing chicken were not . immediate for Peter Clarke. He started feeling 'vaguely unwell' three . days later; his grandson Cai didn't become ill, possibly because the . bacteria only splashed onto Peter's food or hands. Peter woke that . morning with an upset tummy. For the next four days, he was rushing to . the lavatory so was stuck indoors and didn't feel like eating. He . decided to chance leaving the house to see his GP, who prescribed a . medicine to stop the diarrhoea. By the following day he had started to . improve. His doctor asked Peter to give a stool sample - standard . practice for anyone with severe symptoms - which was then tested and . found to contain campylobacter. Environmental Health contacted Peter . to try to determine the source of the bacteria - this usually happens . only when it's thought the cause might be linked to an establishment . that sells food. 'Someone mentioned raw chicken and asked if I'd . washed it,' explains Peter, who was back to full strength a couple of . weeks later. 'Because I hadn't been out to eat, it was the most obvious . cause. I was surprised something so routine was to blame. I stayed in . bed most of the time, as I felt so rotten. 'There should be notices on chicken telling people not to wash it because most don't realise. 'What . happened has made me wonder what goes on in kitchens, and I prefer . eating out at places where I can see the food being prepared. I haven't . eaten chicken since, but I certainly won't wash it again.' For days Peter was rushing to the lavatory so was stuck indoors and didn't feel like eating . There . are steps consumers can take to protect themselves from campylobacter, . says microbiologist Bob Martin, from the Food Standards Agency: .","Peter Clarke, 79, from Cardiff had a nasty stomach bug in February .
It followed a chicken meal, and kept him housebound for nearly a week .
Contracted a campylobacter infection - common cause of food poisoning .
Thought to have caught it when he washed the chicken before cooking it .
Don't wash raw chicken. There is no reason to clean chicken or wash off .
visible blood - it doesn't make it any more hygienic or remove bugs.
Use separate chopping  boards for chicken and other ingredients, such as salad  and vegetables.
Disinfect surfaces, dishcloths, sponges and utensils that raw chicken .
has come into contact with to avoid spreading the bacteria around the .
kitchen.
When possible, clean them in the dishwasher, as the .
combination of heat, water and detergent kills the bugs. Clean work .
surfaces or other items with hot water and an anti-microbial .
disinfectant, such as a bleach spray.
Make sure the chicken is .
cooked properly - either by checking with a temperature probe that it's .
70c or by making sure the meat isn't pink - and that the juices running .
out of it are clear ."
"A former veterinarian's clinic employee has had animal cruelty charges against her dropped after she was caught on camera slamming a dog against a wall in 2013.

Sheriff's deputies investigated the case and handed it to the state attorney's office, which filed two animal-cruelty charges. Scroll down for video . A video obtained by an Orlando television station shows a veterinary technician hanging a dog by its neck and repeatedly slamming the animal against a wall . The technician appears to be swinging the dog in the air using a rope that is tied around its neck .

Stasse . was working at the Emergency Pet Hospital of Orlando at the time of the . incident. She has since been fired, according to the owner of the . hospital, Dr. Mohammad Hassan. In initial interviews with WFTV, Hassan defended Stasse, saying she was handling the dog in such a violent manner because it had become aggressive. 'There was no damage whatsoever to the dog there,' he said. He said the video was 'obviously stolen' and manipulated to edit out parts where Stasse had handled the dog more gently. The person who 'stole' the video 'obviously has bad blood' with Stasse, he added. This is Stefanie Stasse, formerly the lead veterinary technician at Emergency Pet Hospital of Orlando . In initial interviews on the matter, the owner of the Emergency Pet Hospital of Orlando, Mohammad Hassan (pictured)  defended his employee's actions, saying she was handling the dog in such a violent manner because it had become aggressive . Hassan also said that two people on his staff had been injured by the dog before Stasse stepped in. 'Human safety comes first,' he said. 'If anybody gets injured its a big liability.' But a public outcry ensued once the video was released and Hassan eventually backed away from defending the employee, who he had earlier described as a 'good pet owner with multiple dogs and cats.' 'I want to apologize to all of the pet owners and animal lovers who were rightly shocked by the cruelty on the video,' Hassan said in a recent statement posted to the hospital's Facebook wall. 'I was similarly shocked and sickened. We will go forward in the upcoming weeks and months working hard to clear the name of this facility, which believes in the ethical treatment and care of animals, and works tirelessly against their mistreatment.'","Stefanie Stasse was fired from her workplace in Orlando, Florida, after a video showing the alleged abuse was discovered .

"Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl will be formally questioned by an Army investigator on Wednesday about his 2009 disappearance in Afghanistan. Bergdahl will be interviewed by Major General Kenneth Dahl, who was appointed to head up the AR 15-6 investigation into the circumstances leading up to his captivity. The pair have already met informally, though Wednesday will be their first formal interaction and the interview will take place at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. Bergdahl's attorney Eugene Fidell told the New York Daily News that he will meet with Bergdahl today to prepare for Dahl's questions, and will also attend on Wednesday. An Army lawyer assigned to Bergdahl's case will attend with them. Scroll down for video . Time to talk: Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, pictured, will be formally questioned by an Army investigator on Wednesday about his 2009 disappearance in Afghanistan . The former prisoner of war was released in May in a prisoner swap with the Taliban after five years in captivity. Soon after, accusations began to emerge that he deserted. Greg Rinckey, a former JAG officer and military practice lawyer, told the Daily News that he expects Bergdahl to answer Dahl's questions though Fidell may call a stop to the probing at any point. The news comes a week after bitterly divided House panel voted to condemn President Barack Obama for the swap of five Taliban leaders for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. The Republican-led Armed Services Committee backed a nonbinding resolution that disapproves of the exchange and faults Obama for failing to notify Congress 30 days in advance of the swap, as required by law. The vote was 34-25 with two Democrats - Reprentatives Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Mike McIntyre of North Carolina - joining Republicans in support of the measure. The bipartisan resolution raises national security concerns about the transfer of the five Taliban, who had been held at the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for more than a decade, and the 'repercussions of negotiating with terrorists.' The measure also expresses relief that Bergdahl has returned safely to the United States. The full House is expected to consider the measure in the fall, just a few weeks before the midterm elections. The Obama administration has come under harsh criticism from many in Congress, especially Republicans, who have said Bergdahl was a deserter and the United States gave up too much for his freedom. Several lawmakers have cited intelligence suggesting the high-level Taliban officials could return to the Afghanistan battlefield. Investigator: Bergdahl will be interviewed by Major General Kenneth Dahl, pictured, who was appointed to head up the AR 15-6 investigation into the circumstances leading up to Bergdahl's captivity . Five senior Taliban were released from detention at Guantanamo in exchange for Bergdahl, who had disappeared from his post in Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan on June 30, 2009. The five Taliban are to remain in Qatar for a year. The administration has defended the swap and its decision to keep Congress in the dark, saying concern about Bergdahl's health and safety required speedy action. The Joint Chiefs of Staff has unanimously supported the exchange, insisting that the United States has a sacred commitment to men and women who serve that it will never leave anyone behind on the battlefield. Army General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said the swap in May was 'likely our last, best opportunity' to free Bergdahl. During the hearing, Republicans on the Armed Services panel accused Obama of breaking the law, with Representative Trent Franks, Republican for Arizona, referring to a 'lawless presidency' in which the president has failed to live up to his oath of office. Representative Scott Rigell, Republican for Virginia, who pushed for the resolution, said if Congress fails to act now, future presidents will ignore the law. Democrats maintained that the resolution was one step toward impeachment of Obama, part of a broader GOP effort that includes the House lawsuit, led by Speaker John Boehner, Republican for Ohio, against the president for unilateral changes in the health care law.","Bergdahl will be interviewed by Major General Kenneth Dahl .

"It used to be that surrogacy was considered an option exclusively for infertile couples, but it appears more and more women are doing it for less medically urgent reasons. According to Elle Magazine, 'social surrogacy' is on the rise, with mothers choosing not to carry their baby themselves in order not to upset their work life or 'ruin' their bodies. 'I call these cases designer surrogacy,' said San Diego-based fertility doctor Lorni Arnold, whose patients have included a socialite 'who didn't want to get fat' and a runner about to do a marathon. To have or not to have: 'Social surrogacy' is on the rise, with more and more mothers choosing not to carry their baby themselves in order not to upset their work life or 'ruin' their bodies . Dr Arnold explained that pregnancy can also be a financial hindrance to women, since it can mean a months-long pause in their career. 'Some women work right up to the moment they deliver, but others can be bedridden for several months,' she said. That was the reason wedding photographer Mari Smith, who chose not to reveal her real name to the magazine, began considering surrogacy. At 36, Mari had been putting off having a baby with her husband because business was finally booming, and she couldn't bear to risk wrecking it. What's more, she was working 60 hours a week to build her brand and says she simply didn't have time for pregnancy, much less potential complications like morning sickness or being put on bed rest. With her baby clock ticking louder and louder, she spoke with a clinical psychologist friend named Jhutty who owns a surrogacy agency called Conceptual Options. Frustrated with all the complicated fertility math and ovulation tracking involved in trying to perfectly time her own pregnancy, Mari joked: 'I wish I could just use a surrogate.' 'I could be out of work for months. People could forget about me. I have to be out there . producing and being visible' Surprisingly, her friend was encouraging, and what started as a joke became an option she was determined to carry out. Even though the approximate total cost of surrogacy is a staggering $100,000, Mari sees it as the best and most reliable way for her and her husband to finally expand their family. And the fact that childbirth itself is painful and can affect the body certainly was something of a factor. Indeed, after visiting a friend who told her she'd been ripped 'head to toe' after delivering her ten-pound baby, Mari was horrified. 'Oh God!' she wrote in an e-mail to Jhutty. 'I don't want to go through that if I don't have to.' Risk of judgement: Rumors abounded when Sarah Jessica Parker announced in 2009 that she and Matthew Broderick were 'happily anticipating the birth of their twin daughters... with the generous help of a surrogate' Mari is one of a growing number of . women who are choosing not to carry their own baby, even if they are . medically capable of doing so. While it may seem somewhat morally questionable, the guidelines for surrogacy are vague and not always binding. Indeed, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, surrogacy should be used only 'when a . true medical condition precludes the intended parent from carrying a . pregnancy or would pose a significant risk of death or harm to the woman . or the fetus.' But the definition of 'harm' can vary from doctor to doctor, with some saying psychological setbacks - like the fear of being pregnant - are reason enough. Vicken Sahakian, a doctor at Pacific . Fertility Center in Los Angeles, says he's overseen about 20 'social' cases. 'They're for reasons most people would find offensive,' he explained, adding: 'I don't . ask these patients too many questions because I don't want them to feel . judged.' Celebrity mom: Nicole Kidman faced some skepticism after she and Keith Urban paid a gestational carrier to give birth to their daughter Faith Margaret (left) in 2010 . And judgement is certainly an issue for women who opt for surrogacy, with some people assuming they're doing it to maintain their figure or work life. Rumors abounded, for instance, when Sarah Jessica Parker announced in 2009 that she and Matthew Broderick were 'happily anticipating the birth of their twin daughters... with the generous help of a surrogate'. 'They're reasons most people would find offensive. I don't ask these patients too many questions because I don't want them to feel judged' And Nicole Kidman faced some skepticism after she and Keith Urban paid a gestational carrier to give birth to their daughter Faith in 2008. Of course, both of these women were in their forties at the time, when pregnancy is significantly more dangerous for both the mother and the fetus. For Mari, the risk of judgement by her peers or her family members (her husband's mother is far from impressed to have a 'stranger' carry her grandchild) are outweighed by the benefits of surrogacy. 'I could be out [of work] three or . four months,' she said of conceiving naturally. 'People could forget about me. I have to be out there . constantly producing and being visible.'","San Diego-based fertility doctor Lorni Arnold says her patients have included a socialite who 'didn't want to get fat' and a runner with an upcoming marathon .

"A San Francisco engineer has created a unique hi-tech ring to propose to his fiance - which lights up when he is nearby. 36 year old Ben Kokes, who works for an electronics firm, spent five months perfecting the ring before finally giving it his fiance Julie Nicolai, 35 - and said she was so excited by it she didn't let him finish his proposal speech. Hidden inside the ring are tiny LEDs which light up when Kokes is nearby, illuminating the stones in the titanium ring. Scroll down for video . The glowing ring contains tiny LEDs which light up when a transmitter is nearby - and took five months to build. Ben Kokes and his fiance Julie Nicolai - who accepted the hi-tech proposal . Embedded in the ring is a copper coild and a series of tiny LEDs. When they are in close proximity to an induced alternating magnetic field, which is housed in a special armband, the LEDs light up under the stones. However, the armband needs to be within 3-4 inches at the moment - something Kokes hopes to improve in the wedding ring. Kokes told MailOnline creating the ring took five months. 'I knew I wanted to build it, but didn't know how - I'm an engineer, so think about this kind of thing all the time,' he said. 'I spent a lot of time thinking about how to propose, and started to think about the ring you see today. I started work on it in January, and then finally proposed in mid-May.' Wrapped within the interior of the ring is a coil of copper, which generates a current when exposed to an alternating magnetic field. To supply the field, Kokes built a wrist-mounted device that he could wear and easily conceal, as well as surreptitiously activate when the time came. 'It is quite bulky, and you need to be within 3-4 inches, but I managed to hide it under my jacket, he said. 'Several designs were considered and were rejected because of exotic material requirements, machining geometry limitations or violating the laws of physics. 'It was a fun exercise to explore potential and unique designs, but at the end of the day, I still needed to make her something that I could present and that didn't look like it was carved with a spoon,' he said. The glowing ring is made from titanium - and contains tiny LEDs which light up when a transmitter is nearby . Inside the ring: Copper conducting wires and the LEDs are clearly visible as the ring was under construction . However, the proposal did not go according to plan. 'We live in San Francisco, and across . the bay is a hill, so I wanted to hike there at dusk, and propose. However, it was really foggy - so after hiking for an hour, we had to . abandon the plan, so we can back to the city and I proposed there.'

"Presumably nobody at Manchester United explained to Louis van Gaal how the English fixture list works. If they had, he surely wouldn't be complaining about the number of matches in December. United started a run of nine games in 36 days with the 3-0 win over Hull on Saturday and the Dutchman has had a good old whinge about the packed schedule and the fact he can't spend Christmas at home in the armchair in the corner. ‘I’m not happy but I cannot change it,’ said Van Gaal, whose team face Stoke on Tuesday. ‘I don’t agree with it because I don’t think that it is good for the players that they play another match within two days. In December, it shall be like that. A stern-faced Louis van Gaal before Manchester United's victory over Hull on Saturday . The Dutchman has had a whinge about the packed schedule in December . Manchester United face a busy Christmas schedule which could well define their season . ‘We also have families. I also have a wife and kids and grandchildren and I cannot see them this Christmas. 'But I want to work in the Premier League, I have to adapt and I shall adapt. But I don’t think it is good for players, neither for the families.’ Here's the smallest violin in the world Louis, just for you. What Van Gaal, who has now presided over a whopping 14 competitive fixtures in around four months, forgets is that it's the same for everyone. Liverpool, for instance, have 11 matches in the next month, including FA Cup third-round weekend. It's not like United's players will be overburdened in the new year, either, seeing as they failed to qualify for Europe and were dumped out of the Capital One Cup by MK Dons. There have been a lot of injuries but the ludicrously lop-sided buying policy (carried out by a Mr A van Gaal, no less) has not helped. And let's face it, when January rolls around Van Gaal could get another £100million to chuck around on new players if anyone picks up a bad injury, despite senior figures at the club insisting there will be no spending in the upcoming transfer window. The festive fixture list is one of the things that makes English football great, so the Dutchman will just have to lump it as he continues to adapt to his not-so new surroundings. And he can console himself with the thought that by the time this 36-day spell is over he will have earned £690,000 - plenty of money with which to buy presents for those neglected family members.

"Justin Rose will try to forget that he is on home soil as he looks to make the Open Championship his third victory in succession this week. Rose produced a flawless closing 65 to win the Scottish Open at Royal Aberdeen on Sunday, a fortnight after winning the Quicken Loans National on the PGA Tour. It is the first time in his career that Rose has won consecutive events and the 33-year-old knows making it a hat-trick will be a massive ask at Hoylake giving his previous Open record. Double delight? Justin Rose is aiming to win the Open Championship after victory at the Scottish Open . Perfect preparation: Rose celebrates on the 18th green at Royal Aberdeen after triumphing with a round of 65 . Since famously finishing fourth as a 17-year-old amateur in 1998, Rose has not recorded another top-10 finish in 11 attempts, missing the cut in three of the last four years. But perhaps there is a good omen in the fact that Tiger Woods was the last player to make a major championship his third consecutive victory, winning the Open the last time it was staged at Hoylake in 2006, then adding the Buick Open and the US PGA Championship in a run of seven straight strokeplay wins that season. 'I've tried to see it as my home major and I am not paying attention to that now,' Rose said. 'A major is a major. 'If Tiger is playing the US Open he doesn't think, ""This is my home major"", it's just another major championship. From that perspective I am just trying to deflect any extra pressure and although my recent Open record is not good, I do take confidence from Turnberry in 2009 for example. 'Even though the record book won't suggest it [he finished 13th], I was right in the hunt there. I played beautiful golf that week, good enough to win and I know that. There's been a few occasions where I've had good runs and a few occasions where I've been on the bad side of the draw. 'If you go out and play wonderful golf you can make up for the draw, but if you are sort of borderline the draw can make a big difference too. I am trying not to pay too much attention to it (my record) but I have played great links golf in my career in different times so I just have to put it all together next week.' On form: Rose's win in Scotland came after his victory in the Quicken Loans National on the PGA Tour . He's got previous: Rose is hoping to add a second major title to his collection after winning the 2013 US Open . Rose already has one major trophy in his cabinet thanks to last year's US Open triumph at Merion and added: 'I've got a nice trophy case with varying sizes to fit all options so hopefully there will be more. I'll build a new house if need be. That won't be a problem.' And he has been backed to add more trophies to his collection by the man he beat into second place at Merion and who performed the Scottish Open-Open Championship double 12 months ago. 'Prior to last year I think everybody would rule him out because he won the week before. But now that it's been done, and somebody has won the week before and followed it up with the Open Championship, I think it's an advantage,' Mickelson said. 'I think it's an advantage to play the Scottish Open on links golf, get acclimated to the time over here, get acclimated to seeing the ball bounce, and the fescue and thicker grasses on the greens and long lag putts that we are going to have, and putting in crosswinds.

"Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, Al Qaeda's chief bombmaker, is believed to have been killed in an ambush by U.S- backed special forces in Yemen . An Al Qaeda mastermind whose plots included a notorious aircraft underpants bomb is believed to have been killed by special forces in Yemen. Ibrahim al-Asiri, who was also suspected of concealing explosives in ink cartridges found on planes at East Midlands Airport, is said to have died in a shootout. Officials in Yemen said they were ‘confident’ the terror chief, who specialised in building devices for mid-air attacks, was one of the victims of the ambush. Efforts were yesterday being made to identify the body but, if confirmed, the strike will be the most high-profile against Al Qaeda leaders since Osama bin Laden and hate cleric Anwar al-Awlaki were killed in 2011. Saudi Arabian-born al-Asiri, 32, is believed to have made the underpants bomb carried by one-time British student Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in his attempt to blow up an airliner over the US on Christmas Day 2009. A US official described the target of the ambush as ‘high-value’. Al-Asiri is one of the CIA’s top two targets in the region. The other extremist heading the hit-list is Nasir al-Wuhayshi, leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and a former member of bin Laden’s inner circle. A Yemeni government official said: ‘The body of a high-value Al Qaeda target is being tested to confirm its identity.’ The shooting, on Sunday night, was part of a three-day operation against AQAP. At least 65 militants were killed in the offensive involving CIA-controlled drone strikes, bombing raids by Yemeni jets and missions by US and Yemeni special forces. The raids followed the release of a video showing al-Wuhayshi urging a large group of extremists at an open-air meeting to ‘eliminate’ America. Scroll down for video . People gather near a destroyed car that was carrying militants in the Sawmaa area of al-Bayda province, Yemen, Saturday .

The ambush took place on a road in the . lawless southern Shabwa province, east of the capital Sanaa. Al-Asiri . is Al Qaeda’s most notorious bombmaker and is the prime suspect in . several airliner plots. He . was named as the extremist behind a plot by foiled suicide bomber . Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian former student at University College London, . who tried to detonate explosives on a Northwest Airlines flight that was . en route from Amsterdam to Detroit in 2009. The . bomb was designed to be carried within the fabric of his underwear. It . contained no metallic parts, making it extremely hard to detect. After . this plot failed, al-Asiri tried in 2010 to conceal Semtex-style . explosives in Hewlett-Packard printer ink cartridges placed on a UPS . Airline cargo flight by two Yemeni women. They were discovered at East Midlands Airport and removed from a plane en route to Chicago. On Saturday and Sunday, several air strikes - presumed to be carried out chiefly by U.S. drones - were launched on central and southern provinces of Yemen . Al-Asiri . also built a bomb for his own brother Abdullah, 23, so he could carry . out a daring attack on Saudi prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdul Aziz, . the minister who led a programme to encourage jihadists  to reform.

"Mobile phones may have a significant impact on a man’s fertility, scientists think. Men who keep a phone in their trouser pocket could be exposing themselves to radiation which lowers their chance of becoming a father. Scientists at the University of Exeter found that electromagnetic radiation lowered the viability and movement of sperm by 8 per cent. The team said that 'cumulative' radiation from modern technology may be having a 'cumulative' impact on sperm . Most of the global adult population now own mobiles, and around 14 per cent of couples in wealthy countries have difficulty conceiving. A team led by Dr Fiona Mathews, of the University of Exeter, conducted a review of the findings from 10 studies, involving 1,492 men. Dr Mathews said the findings suggest that mobile radiation has an impact on fertility - but said much more research is needed to draw any firm conclusions. She said: ‘Given the enormous scale of mobile phone use around the world, the potential role of this environmental exposure needs to be clarified. ‘This study strongly suggests that being exposed to radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation from carrying mobiles in trouser pockets negatively affects sperm quality. ‘This could be particularly important for men already on the borderline of infertility, and further research is required to determine the full clinical implications for the general population.’ Sperm quality can be affected in three different ways: viability, or how much of the sperm is healthy; motility, or how well it moves towards an egg; and concentration of sperm cells in semen. Most men have 50 to 85 per cent of sperm with normal movement. The researchers found this proportion fell by an average of 8 per cent when there was exposure to mobile phones. The paper, published in the journal Environment International today, found similar effects were seen for sperm viability. Dr Allan Pacey, a leading fertility expert at the University of Sheffield, said he would be continuing to keep his iPhone in his trouser pocket . The authors warned that handheld gadgets may be combining with radiation from internet wifi and other technologies to lower fertility rates globally. They said that ‘cumulative’ radiation from modern technology may be having a ‘cumulative’ impact on sperm. The authors write: ‘For example, recent evidence found wifi from laptops also negatively affected sperm quality. A better understanding of the collective influence of environmental factors on sperm quality and subsequent fertility, will help improve treatment, advice and support for individuals seeking fertility treatment.’ Dr Allan Pacey, a leading fertility expert at the University of Sheffield, said he was not convinced by the study. ‘There have been some crazy and alarming headlines on this subject. ‘In my opinion, the studies undertaken to date have been somewhat limited. ‘That’s because they have either sperm kept in a dish irradiated at frequencies used by mobile phones - which is not realistic - or they have made assessments of men’s phone habits without adequately considering other aspects of their lifestyle. ‘What we need are some properly designed epidemiological studies where mobile phone use is considered alongside other lifestyle habits. ‘Until that time, I will be continuing to keep my iPhone in my trouser pocket!’","Scientists at the University of Exeter .

"It is often said that your name says a lot about you and it's probably true that people make assumptions about others based on them. So how would you feel knowing that your harder-to-pronounce name may affect your credibility? According to a new study the pronounceability of people’s names can influence how much we believe them when evaluating their claims. Credible actress: Actress Lupita Nyong'o poses with her Oscar earlier this year. Scientists say that harder-to-pronounce names make people less trustworthy . Mexican-Kenyan Luipita Nyong'o has said people often struggle to pronounce her name, but whether they believe her or not, it's not affected her outstanding career . The study by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, and Kwantlen Polytechnic University in Canada, asked undergraduate volunteers to rate the pronounceability of real . names from 18 countries across the word. Based . on these results, the team leading the research then made up their own . set of difficult-to-pronounce-names, such as Yevgeni Dherzhinsky and . Shobha Bhattacharya, and a set of ‘easy’ names, such as Putali Angami . and Bodo Wallmeyer. The undergraduate participants were then . given some straightforward trivia statements, such as ‘Giraffes are the . only mammals that cannot jump,’ each credited to one of the names that . they researchers had devised. The students then had to say whether or . not they thought the statements were true. The aim, according to Scientific American who reported the results, was to see if the names had any . influence over the believability of the statements. In their words: ‘To . what extent are our evaluations of people’s credibility swayed by how . easily we can pronounce their names?’ Would you trust Emily Ratajkowski? According to a new study, harder-to-pronounce names make the person less believable . Does your name affect your credibility? A study says yes, but model Emily Ratajkowski, pictured here, certainly hasn't seemed to have let that get in the way of her runway success . They predicted that those with ‘easier’ names would appear more credible. And their predictions proved correct. The results confirmed that a greater number of . statements paired with easy names resulted in a greater number of ‘true’ responses. If the findings are to be believed, what does that mean for popular celebrities whose names aren’t quite so easy to pronounce? Stunning model, Emily Ratajkowsk, above, who . shot to fame in Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines video last year and is has a . role in next year’s Fifty Shades of Grey, has just been voted fourth . Sexiest Woman in the World by FHM magazine. 'Tis but a name: Actors Chiwetel Ejiofor and Nikolaj Coster-Walda, right, might not be the easiest names to pronounce, but does that make them less credible? Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Walda stars in the hot show Game of Thrones as Jaime Lannister. His name certainly hasn't held back his career, but would you trust him? She’s of British descent and was raised in the US, and it seems her tricky to say surname hasn't set her back so far. This year’s Academy Awards saw rising star Lupita Nyong'o win Best Supporting Actress and . Chiwetel Ejiofor nominated for Best Actor. Game of Thrones heart throb Nikolaj Coster-Waldau hasn’t done too badly off his Danish name, either.

"Defendant: Siale Angilau, pictured, who reportedly belonged to Tongan Crip gang, was hospitalized with at least one chest wound, FBI spokesman Mark Dressen said. He later died in hospital of his injuries . A U.S. marshal shot and killed a defendant on Monday in a new federal courthouse after the man rushed the witness stand with a pen at his trial in Salt Lake City, authorities said. Defendant Siale Angilau, who reportedly belonged to Tongan Crip gang, was hospitalized with at least one chest wound, FBI spokesman Mark Dressen said. He later died in hospital of his injuries. 'During the trial this morning the defendant went after, engaged the witness stand, and when he engaged the witness at the witness stand, he was shot by the U.S. Marshals Service,' Dressen said. 'From what I understand, the defendant may have grabbed a pen or a pencil and charged the witness stand at that time.' The witness wasn't hurt. Angilau, . 25, was one of 17 people named in a 29-count racketeering indictment . filed in 2008 accusing gang members of conspiracy, assault, robbery and . weapons offenses. Along . with a string of robberies and assaults of local store clerks, the . 6-foot-3, 260-pound Angilau also was accused of assaulting two federal . officers and brandishing a firearm.

"In their heyday they might not have won the seal of approval from everybody, but now eight of our prime ministers are being honoured by Royal Mail in a new set of stamps. William Gladstone, Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher – three of the nation’s most respected politicians – make the list as do Labour stalwarts Clement Attlee and Harold Wilson, and the youngest ever premier, William Pitt the Younger, who took office aged 24 in 1783. Pitt’s last words when he died in 1806 were said to have been: ‘Oh my country, how I love my country!’ Seal of approval: Royal Mail is launching a new set of stamps with  Prime Ministers from Thatcher to Wilson . Men of letters: Wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill features, as does the Labour stalwart Clement Attlee . Robert Peel and Charles Grey from the 19th century complete the set of 97p and first-class stamps, approved by the Queen, to be released in October. Eyebrows will be raised, however, by some of the omissions. For example, Benjamin Disraeli – Gladstone’s great foe – was the architect of One Nation conservatism and confidant of Queen Victoria. David Lloyd George was a great social reformer before leading the country to victory in the First World War and into the 1920s. And, love him or loathe him, Tony Blair was in 1997 the youngest prime minister for almost 200 years and, after a decade in Downing Street, became the longest-serving Labour premier. William Gladstone held the office four times in the late 1880s, while Robert Peel helped create modern police . Charles Grey achieved more than just the name of a tea, while Pitt the Younger was just 24 when he took office . Paul Lay, editor of History Today magazine, said: ‘This is an intriguing selection. 'Some need little introduction, yet figures such as Charles Grey, though little known today, played crucial roles in some of Britain’s most important events, such as the Great Reform Act of 1832, which set the country on the path to mass democracy, and the abolition of slavery.’ A Royal Mail spokesman said the stamps were a historical look at prime ministers who had been ‘influential in their position’. He added: ‘As the UK is the one of the oldest parliamentary democracies in the world, it is fitting that we mark eight individuals who have held the role over the centuries.’","William Pitt the Younger and Clement Attlee also feature in new collection .

"The Queen has gone green and started using hydro-electric power to light up Windsor Castle . The Queen has gone green and started using hydro-electric power to light up Windsor Castle. In fact, nearly all the electricity at the historic castle is now being generated at a mini power station on a lock on the River Thames. After a series of trials earlier this year, a deal to provide the green electricity has started, and two giant water turbines have been installed at Romney Lock on the river at Windsor to generate the power. The Queen is the only customer and at times the generators produce so much energy that it is passed on from the castle to the rest of the town. David Dechambeau, managing director of Southeast Power Engineering, which installed the turbines, signed a 15-year deal with the Royal Household. ‘I was in wellies and couldn’t go into Buckingham Palace, so I signed it on the marble handrail of a fountain in the grounds,’  he says. ‘Fifteen years is a long time for a power contract. But it works as security for us and also for the Royal Household. ‘The turbines produce 2 million kwh per year, which is enough to power 400 houses — or one big castle. ‘To produce a similar amount in a conventional power station, you would have to burn  2 million lb of coal. 'There are times — during drought or flooding — when the castle will have to switch its supply, but the lion’s share is from the hydro-power turbines.’ Says a Palace spokeswoman: ‘The plant is providing a proportion of the castle’s daily requirements, but it is too early to say what proportion that will be over the course of the year, as the demand naturally varies between winter and summer. ‘The project is still in its infancy, so it is too early to assess the size of the carbon emissions saved.’ Nearly all the electricity at the historic castle is now being generated at a mini power station on a lock on the River Thames . Phone hijack: Thieves ripped the iPhone 5 from Katie Melua's hands as she walked home . Sultry songbird Katie Melua has become the latest celebrity victim  of street robbers targeting smartphone users  in London. Thieves ripped the singer’s iPhone 5 from her hands as she walked from a recording studio in Notting Hill to her home in nearby Holland Park earlier this week. ‘It was quite late, but with the weather being so gorgeous I thought a stroll would be great,’ says Katie, 28. ‘And because I’m not familiar with the backstreets, I was holding my phone out in front of me and following the directions on a map home.’ A shaken Katie, who last night sang for the Queen at the Coronation Gala at Buckingham Palace, tells me: ‘I heard running steps behind me and before I could turn to see who it was, I felt their hands grab mine and wrestle my phone out of my grip.’ Happily, the Georgia-born singer, who is married to superbike champion James Toseland, escaped unhurt. ‘I was spooked and shocked, but I’m relieved they didn’t take my bag, too. Afterwards, I went up to a couple nearby and asked them to walk with me and help me find a taxi,’ she adds. In recent months, mugging victims have included Annette Mason, wife of Pink Floyd star Nick, who had her phone ripped from her hands as she walked across Hampstead Heath. The affair between Leveson Inquiry lovebirds Carine Patry Hoskins and David Sherborne, which has resulted in them both being investigated by the Bar Standards Board, has hit another snag. Patry Hoskins has been unable to find a buyer for the house she shared in Islington with husband Mark Hoskins, from whom she is now divorced. The elegant Victorian building has been on sale since December with a price tag of £4.1 million. It boasts four bedrooms, a combined kitchen and living room, terrace, garden and laundry room. Meanwhile, a senior member of the bar tells me the couple have been spotted holding hands in El Vino, the famous Fleet Street wine bar. Hoofing it: Antalya Nall-Cain is the girlfriend of former matador-turned-writer- Alexander Fiske-Harrison . Last year, three people were gored. This year, two have been badly injured so far. But it hasn’t deterred adventurous Antalya Nall-Cain from taking part in Spain’s famous but risky Pamplona bull run. Antalya, 25, the daredevil daughter of Lord Brocket, joined a sea of runners as they sprinted ahead of a herd of angry bulls through the cobbled streets of the city during the San Fermin festival. ‘It was so scary,’ says willowy Antalya, who is also the girlfriend of former matador-turned-writer Alexander Fiske-Harrison, 11 years her senior. Even a stiff drink after the adrenaline-fuelled event couldn’t calm her nerves. ‘Brandy is a must, although I felt sick afterwards, considering it was 8.30am,’ she says. But Antalya, who is studying to become a nutritionist in London, is adamant she won’t be repeating her bull-running feat — made famous in Ernest Hemingway’s epic novel, The Sun Also Rises. She adds: ‘I’m glad for the experience, but I’m not inclined to do it again. At least I earned the T-shirt.’ Seven years ago, TV explorer Ben Fogle and James Cracknell caused a stir when they completed the world’s toughest rowing race across the Atlantic — in the nude. Now four polo-playing hunks are preparing to follow in their birthday suits. They are Viscount Melville, former England polo captain Henry Brett, James Glasson and Jamie LeHardy, who will set off from the Canaries in December aiming to arrive 3,000 nautical miles later at Nelson’s Dockyard in Antigua in around 40 days. Bobby Melville, 29, newly solo after parting from shoe heiress Melissa Lilley, is looking forward to the challenge for which he will raise money for children’s charity Right To Play. ‘It’s just as well I don’t have a girlfriend at the moment because, by the end, we’ll all have long hair and beards like Tom Hanks in Cast Away — which will be a scary sight,’ he says. Adds Bobby: ‘James Cracknell has given us lots of useful advice, including sitting on sheepskin while we’re rowing to prevent chafing.’ Few are missing the late Lord Campbell of Alloway more than the bar staff at the House of Lords. War hero Alan Campbell, 96, the oldest sitting member of the Lords, ascribed his longevity to a rigid diet of snifters. At around 12.30pm every day he took three generous pink gins before getting stuck into some wine with lunch. In the early evening, the heavy smoker would then sink four family-sized whiskies before toddling home, sometimes in his own car. He married for the third time two years ago. He will be much missed. PS Scottish Olympic swimmer David Wilkie takes a dim view of Alex Salmond’s saltire stunt in the royal box after Andy Murray’s tennis triumph at Wimbledon. ‘Bloody politicians. They’re always there,’ he says. ‘I thought it was a cheap, nasty political stunt.’ Stylish Wilkie, a gold medallist at the Montreal Games, says of his fellow Scot: ‘Salmond is using people for what they can give him. 'I’m sure he’s a cynical man and that shows the cynical part of politics. I don’t think it reflected well on Scotland.’","Nearly all the electricity at the castle is now generated at a mini power station on a lock on the River Thames .

"The Court of Auditors said billions of euros were handed out without proper checks, and errors are on the rise . The European Union is still wasting billions every year, spending watchdogs said today as they refused to sign off  official accounts - again. It is the 18th successive year that the Court of Auditors has said the EU’s finances were in such a mess that they could not be given a clean bill of health. In fact errors are still on the rise. It included a ‘special premium’ paid to a farmer for 150 sheep which did not exist and 200,000 euros paid for a two-storey ""laboratory"" for producing fruit in Lombardy, Italy which inspectors found had ‘predominantly the charters of a private residence’. The revelations will heap pressure on David Cameron who suffered a humiliating Commons defeat last week as Labour and Tory rebels united to demand he insist on a cut on the vast budget at talks next month. The 27 member states and the executive Commission stand accused of failing to do enough to track billions of pounds in spending at a time when countries are imposing deep spending cuts at homes. The Court of Auditors said that errors in EU payments had risen to 3.9 per cent from the 2011 budget of almost 130billion euros (£104billion). It added that there were ‘too many cases of EU money not hitting the target or being used sub-optimally’. Acknowledging the clamour for cuts in spending, ECA President Vitor Caldeira said it was essential for the EU to disburse its current budget ‘more efficiently’. He added: ‘Member states must agree on better rules for how EU money is spent, and member states and the European Commission must enforce them properly.’ Marta Andreasen, a UK Independence Party MEP, said: ‘If this report, outlining as it does the continued gross mismanagement of EU funds, doesn't set alarm bells ringing in Downing Street then nothing will.’ The former European Commission Chief Accountant added: ‘There is a new generation who will be voting later this month who have never known an EU with clean accounts.’ UKIP MEP Marta Andreasen, a former Accounting Officer for the European Commission, said today's report should set alarm bells ringing in Downing Street . Next month EU leaders will clash at a summit clash over calls from Eurocrats and MEPs for inflation-busting rises in EU spending, with Mr Cameron threatening to veto anything but a spending freeze. Tonight Mr Cameron faces the threat of another European rebellion in the Commons, amid concerns that closer banking ties in the eurozone could sideline the City of London. Veteran eurosceptic Conservative Bill Cash will lead the revolt, demanding that the Prime Minister vetoes proposals to create a single eurozone banking supervisor unless there are changes to the European Union's treaties. Mr Cash said: ‘The eurozone would be given the opportunity to outvote the non-eurozone countries, which would effectively mean Paris and Frankfurt versus the City of London. That would be singularly bad news for the City of London.’ Today's vote is unlikely to see the government defeated again, but will add to the pressure on Mr Cameron to take a tougher line with Brussels. The Court of Auditors report said the European Commission and EU governments ‘must manage spending better’. But the Commission responded that it was up to national and local authorities, who are responsible for disbursing about 80 per cent of the entire EU budget in regional, social and agriculture grants every year, to get their books straight.","Court of Auditors refuses to give accounts a clean bill of health... again .

"A UFO sighting was deemed so credible it convinced a government minister who investigated it. The sighting by an RAF fighter pilot on a training mission over West Germany in 1952 has been revealed for the first time by papers released by the Churchill Archive at Cambridge University. Flight Sergeant Roland Hughes was returning to base when he was followed by a 'gleaming silver, metallic disc' which flew alongside him before disappearing at incredible sped. Saucer Sam: Sgt Roland Hughes stands beside his fighter with its UFO  art painted on by colleagues after he spotted a UFO that was confirmed by radar . The object was caught by RAF radars, which confirmed it was travelling at speeds far greater than possible for any aircraft of the time. Hughes reported the sighting and was sent to visit Duncan Sandys, then aviation minister, to give his account in person. He described seeing a flash of 'silver light' which rapidly descended towards him until he could see that it was a 'gleaming silver-metallic disc'. He said its surface was shiny, 'like tin foil', and 'without a single crease or crinkle'. He could see, with 'astonishing clarity', the craft's 'highly reflective and absolutely seamless metallic-looking surface'. Flying at high altitude in clear visibility in his de Havilland Vampire, he estimated its size at 100ft across – 'about the wingspan of a Lancaster bomber'. None of the other three pilots - all returning to RAF Oldenburg in northern West Germany - saw the object because they were executing a 'banking turn' and not looking in the same direction. Silver disc: A mock-up of a UFO similar to the one that Sgt Roland Hughes said followed his craft before flying off at incredible speed . Six days later, Hughes was sent to RAF Fassberg in West Germany to give his account to senior RAF officers and Sandys. The minister's first question was how many beers Hughes had drunk the night before. However, in the end he was so taken by the then 23-year-old Hughes' story that he went on to brief senior civil servants, telling them he was convinced it was true. This goes against what British governments have said regarding UFOs in the past - in most cases, they have been keen to downplay suggestions that UFO sightings are seriously investigated. In one newly released document, Sandys tells the government's chief scientist Lord Cherwell that he found the story and radar evidence  'convincing'. Hughes reported the sighting and was sent to visit Duncan Sandys (above),  then aviation minister, to give his account in person . In reference to similar UFO sightings by US pilots, what became known as 'Foo Fighters', Sandys says in the document: 'I have no doubt at all that Hughes saw a phenomenon similar to that described by numerous observers in the United States.' Lord Cherwell had previously dismissed the US sightings as 'mass psychology'. Sandys, who later became Defence Secretary, went on: 'Until some satisfactory scientific explanation can be provided, it would be most unwise to accept without further question the view that ""flying saucers"" can be dismissed as ""a mild form of hysteria"".' Hughes was flying at high altitude in clear visibility on his way to RAF Oldenburg in northern West Germany when he spotted the UFO . He added that there was 'ample evidence of some unfamiliar and unexplained phenomenon'. The documents were investigated by David Clarke, a Sheffield Hallam University academic, while researching for a book on UFOs. Dr Clarke was contacted by Hughes' son, who recounted his father's version of events and gave him his log book. After the sighting, Hughes, who died in 2009 aged 79, was nicknamed 'Saucer Sam' and colleagues painted a flying saucer on his jet. Hughes' son Brian, 45, a Ministry of Defence civil servant  said: 'We knew about the sighting in the family when we were growing up but my father didn't talk about it a lot. We learned about it more from prompting him. 'If it was someone other than my father who had told this story, I would be sceptical. 'He once said to me ""People think you're mad if you say you've seen a flying saucer – I've only ever seen one once; I've never seen one since"".' Dr Clarke said: 'There is absolutely no doubt that something was seen by Hughes. He was not making this up. 'But the only honest position to take is that we don't know what it was. But there could be some sort of scientific explanation, before you start jumping to conclusions about alien visitors.'","Flt Sgt Roland Hughes was returning to base over West Germany .

"Malala Yousafzai, who won the . Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, is hailed around the world as a . champion of women's rights who stood up bravely against the . Taliban to defend her beliefs. But in her deeply conservative homeland, many view her with . suspicion as an outcast or even as a Western creation aimed at . damaging Pakistan's image abroad. Malala, now aged 17, became globally known in 2012 when . Taliban gunmen almost killed her for her passionate advocacy of . women's right to education. Winner: Human rights campaigner Malala Yousafzai, 17, has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . She has since become a symbol of defiance in the fight . against militants operating in Pashtun tribal areas in northwest . Pakistan - a region where women are expected to keep their . opinions to themselves and stay at home. 'The terrorists thought that they would change our aims and . stop our ambitions but nothing changed in my life except this: . Weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and . courage was born,' she told the United Nations last year. 'I do not even hate the Talib who shot me. Even if there is . a gun in my hand and he stands in front of me. I would not shoot . him,' she said in a speech which captivated the world. Malala has also won the European Union's human rights award . and was one of the favourites to win the Nobel Prize last year. Now based in Britain, she is unable to return to her . homeland because of Taliban threats to kill her and her family . members. The current Taliban chief, Mullah Fazlullah, was the . one who ordered the 2012 attack against her. Yousafzai has enrolled in a school in Birmingham and become . a global campaigner for women's right to education and other . human rights issues, taking up issues such as the situation in . Syria and Nigieria. Incredible journey: Malala Yousafzai is greeted by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, second left, Vuk Jeremic, President of the UN General Assembly, right, and Gordon Brown, United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, back to camera, at UN headquarters in New York last summer . In her native Swat valley, however, many people view Malala . - backed by a supportive family and a doting father who inspired . her to keep up with her campaign - with a mixture of suspicion, . fear and jealousy. At the time of her Nobel nomination last year, social media . sites were brimming with insulting messages. 'We hate Malala . Yousafzai, a CIA agent,' said one Facebook page. She was a young student in the Swati town of Mingora in . Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when she . became interested in women's rights. At the time, the Taliban were in power in the strategic . valley after they took control over the region and imposed . strict Islamic rules, including their opposition to women's . education. She wrote an anonymous blog describing her life under the . Taliban controlled the region. In October 2012, after the . Taliban were pushed out of Swat by the Pakistani army, she was . shot in the head on her way to school by a Taliban gunman. She survived after being airlifted to Britain for treatment . and recovered from her life-threatening wounds. 'The wise saying, 'The pen is mightier than sword' was true. The extremists are afraid of books and pens,' she told the . United Nations. 'The power of education frightens them. They are . afraid of women. The power of the voice of women frightens . them.'

"Gluten-free products must in fact be free of wheat, rye and barley starting today - after a new Food and Drug Administration rule took effect. The FDA rule comes amid a growing dietary trend in the U.S. in which an increasing number of people are ruling out foods that contain gluten. Starting Tuesday, food manufacturers must make sure that their products contain less than 20 parts per million of gluten — guaranteeing . that those products are technically free of wheat, rye and barley. That . amount is generally recognized by the medical community to be low . enough so that most people who have Celiac disease won't get sick if . they eat it. Scroll down for video . New rule: Starting Tuesday, manufacturers can only use the term 'gluten free' on a product if it contains less than 20 parts per million of gluten, ensuring that it's free of wheat, rye and barley . Until now, the term 'gluten-free' had . not been regulated, and manufacturers made their own decisions about . what it means. Currently, wheat must be labeled on food packages but . barley and rye are often hidden ingredients. The standard will ensure that companies . can't label products 'gluten-free' if they are cross-contaminated from . other products made in the same manufacturing facility. The rules don't . apply to restaurants, but the Food and Drug Administration is . encouraging them to comply. This . new requirement is especially important for people who suffer from . celiac disease and don't absorb nutrients well. They can get sick from . the gluten found in wheat and other cereal grains. Celiac disease causes abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea, and people who have it can suffer weight loss, fatigue, rashes and other long-term medical problems. Celiac is a diagnosed illness that is more severe than gluten sensitivity, which some people self-diagnose. Ten years ago, most people had never heard of celiac disease. But awareness and diagnosis of the illness have grown exponentially in recent years. It's not entirely clear why. Some researchers say it was underdiagnosed; others say it's because people eat more processed wheat products, such as pasta and baked goods, than in past decades, and those items use types of wheat that have a higher gluten content. Gluten-free foods have become big business in the last several years. Millions of people are buying the foods because they say they make them feel better, even if they don't have celiac disease. Alice Bast of the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness says the gluten-free trend has been good for those diagnosed with celiac because of the increased variety of options in the grocery store. But she said it also may have prompted some companies to lose focus on the people who need those foods the most. The new regulations are 'raising awareness that there is a disease associated with the gluten-free diet,' Ms Bast said. Steve Hughes, CEO of Boulder Brands, which owns leading gluten-free food companies Glutino and Udi's, says his company's products all have 10 parts per million of gluten, less than the new standard. He praises the FDA regulations for being a 'stake in the ground' that can increase the integrity of the gluten-free market. 'If consumers can't have confidence in the products long-term, it's going to hurt the overall trend,' Mr Hughes said.","Any food labeled .

"Google has become so much a part of everyday life many people now use the brand name as a verb for searching, but a new map highlights exactly how far and wide the site spreads across the globe. The map, created by researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute, used data from millions of people's browsing history worldwide and shows Google as the most popular site, in 62 countries.

The 50 Facebook countries account for about 280 million users, placing the social network in third. 'We are likely still in the very beginning of the Age of Internet Empires,' the researchers conclude.

"A map of the Earth, released by Nasa last year, revealed something fishy going on off the coast of Argentina. Around 300 miles offshore, a city of lights was appearing in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean. The strange lights were perplexing as there are no humans, fires or gas wells in that region. A global composite map of Earth's night lights revealed human activity well offshore from South America . What is there however, according to Nasa, are fishing boats with lights powerful enough to be seen in space. The lights were spotted using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite on the Suomi NPP satellite. According to Nasa, the night fishermen are hunting for Illex argentinus, a species of short-finned squid. The squid are found tens to hundreds of kilometres offshore from roughly Rio de Janeiro to Tierra del Fuego. The offshore illumination comes from arrays of green LED lights used to attract squid  to the sea surface . Illex argentinus are a species of short-finned squid. They are found tens to hundreds of kilometres offshore from roughly Rio de Janeiro to Tierra del Fuego. They live 80 to 600 meters below the surface, feeding on shrimp, crabs, and fish. Lights cause the squids food to be attracted to the surface of the ocean . This, in turn, this attracts the squid to the surface where they are easier for fishermen to catch with jigging lines. Scientists first noted such . night-lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s, while . compiling the first maps of the Earth at night. They live 80 to 600 meters below the surface, feeding on shrimp, crabs, and fish. ‘In turn, Illex are consumed by larger finfish, whales, seals, sea birds, penguins ... and humans,’ said Nasa. Scientists first noted such night-lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s, while compiling the first maps of the Earth at night. ‘Squid aggregate in high concentrations at the shelfbreak because it is a very productive area during austral spring and summer,’ explained Marina Marrari, a biological oceanographer with Argentina’s Servicio de Hidrografia Naval. At the shelfbreak front, microscopic plant-like organisms explode in population in various seasons. This ‘grass of the sea’ feeds zooplankton and fish, which then become food for Illex argentinus and other marine creatures. The map shows the distribution of chlorophyll in March 2012 along the coast of South America. The amount of chlorophyll is a measure of how much phytoplankton is growing near the surface. Brighter whites and yellows show the areas with the highest concentrations; blues and green have low concentrations . To draw the plankton and fish that the squid eat to the surface, fishermen use powerful lights, generating as much as 300 kilowatts per boat. Squid follow their prey toward the surface, where they are easier for fishermen to catch with jigging lines. For many squid, the zooplankton and fish they follow is the last meal they will eat. In the South Atlantic, Argentine and Falklands citizens have exclusive rights to fish out to 200 miles. As the map suggests, ships from other nations work as close to that border as they can to get a share of the squid fishing. Scientists first noted such night-lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s, while compiling the first maps of the Earth at night. In this image taken from space, over the course of nine nights, fishing boats shift positions while hugging the borders of the exclusive economic zones of Argentina and the Falkland Islands .","The lights shone in a region were there are no humans, fires or gas wells .

"An Air Canada passenger was rushed to hospital after a propeller broke loose, sliced through the cabin and smashed into her head. Christina Kurylo was aboard a short-distance flight from Calgary to Grande Prairie that was forced to crash-land after a tire burst during take-off on Thursday night. As the Jazz Aviation craft hit the ground in nearby Edmonton, the landing gear collapsed on the right side, sending one of five propellers through the wall of the plane. Scroll down for video . Horror crash: The propeller of this Jazz Aviation craft tore through the cabin of an Air Canada flight on landing . Hospitalized: Christina Kurylo (right) was rushed to hospital after the propeller hit her in the head and body . Treated for bruising and concussion, Ms Kurylo said she is lucky to be alive. 'I'm really lucky. It could have been a million times worse,' Kurylo told Global News. 'I could have died, you know, you never know what could have happened. 'All of a sudden I got hit in the head,' she said. 'It was pretty confusing for me. It's bits and pieces for me after that.' Melissa Menard, Kurylo's colleague at Rock 97.7 Radio in Grand Prairie, Alberta, was also aboard the flight, adding: 'Just from the blow of it happening she had quite a huge head lump and it was quite purple and lots of bruises and scratches.' Kurylo was one of four passengers aboard the 75-person flight to be treated in the University of Alberta Hospital following the crash in Edmonton, Alberta, about 200 miles north of Calgary, where they took off. They have since been released. The remaining 67 passengers and four crew members were evaluated by medical responders on the scene and released, Jazz Aviation said. Airline officials are now investigating the Q400 twin-engine turboprop for faults - though experts believe it could be back in service within months. Scared: Kurylo said she couldn't tell what was going on as the cabin filled with smoke and she was hit . Panic: The flight was forced to land in Edmonton after a tire burst during take-off from Calgary, Alberta . Emergency: Paramedics treated 67 passengers and four crew members at the scene and hospitalized four . Fears: This is not the first time a Jazz Aviation flight malfunctioned and Scandinavia Airlines grounded the craft . The craft blew a tire on takeoff and was unable to turn back to Calgary or continue the 450 miles to Grande Prairie, in north west Alberta. It comes after Scandinavia Airlines grounded the same model following similar incidents in 2007. Between March 2007 and August 2008, there were six incidents around the world. And in January 2013, a landing gear wheel fell off an Air Canada Jazz plane as it landed. David Deveau, vice president of Jazz Aviation, told CTV the firm has no concerns about the aircraft. 'The Q-400, both the original and the next generation aircraft, are extremely robust,' he told CTV Edmonton. 'So we have no concerns about the gear.'","Air Canada flight forced to crash land after tire burst on take-off in Calgary .

"Emmanuel Labram convinced his patient that she did not need further treatment by insisting she was cured of a tumour . A neurosurgeon who lied repeatedly to a patient, falsely telling her he had removed her brain tumour, has been struck off for 'reckless and deplorable misconduct'. Emmanuel . Kingsley Labram convinced his patient and her husband that she did not need further treatment . by insisting she was cured for two years after the failed operation at . Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in September 2008. He then lied to . colleagues and forged documents to keep up the deception, the Medical . Practitioners Tribunal Service has heard. When . Labram told her the lesion had ‘recurred’ in 2010 she then decided to . seek private treatment, which was partially successful, but the tumour . was inoperable. Labram . did not attend the professional disciplinary hearing in Manchester, . which resumed today after a three month delay. The . fitness to practise panel, chaired by Dr Howard Freeman, ruled the . doctor may have genuinely believed he had removed the lesion. But . he was found guilty of misleading and dishonest conduct for trying to . cover his tracks when he realised this was not the case. The panel today found him guilty of serious misconduct and ruled his fitness to practise medicine was impaired as a result. Labram’s name will be erased from the General Medical Council’s . register of doctors in 28 days, subject to his legal right of appeal, . although the panel decided to impose an immediate order of suspension so . he can’t work during that time. The case had heard that after . developing double vision on holiday in November 2007, the woman - known as Patient A . - consulted her optician and was referred to the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. An MRI scan revealed a . tumour about one inch in diameter in an area in her brain known as the . cavernous sinus and she saw Labram to discuss her options in June 2008. She decided to go ahead with an operation and underwent surgery at the hands of Labram on September 2, 2008. Giving . evidence earlier, Patient A said: ‘There was something going on inside . my head and I really needed to find out what it is so Mr Labram offered me . that. ‘If there was a good chance of removing the tumour that’s fantastic. That’s how I felt. ‘He . explained how he would open up my head and try to remove the tumour and . obviously the biopsy would be taken and sent to the pathologist and we . would find out what type of tumour it is.’ After . the operation Mr Labram told her it had been a success and explained to . her husband that he had removed ‘100 per cent’ of the tumour. But . he only removed four tiny hard pale fragments, which could not even be . used to determine what the tumour was as they were ‘non-diagnostic . samples’. But the operation at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (pictured) in 2008 had failed. He then lied to colleagues and forged documents to keep up the deception, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service has heard . Patient A said: ‘He said it’s all gone. He said it was just calcium deposits. That’s how he described it.’ Labram then sent letters to the patient’s GP telling him that no further treatment was necessary. In . January 2009, the surgeon altered a pathology report and sent a forged . copy to his patient in order to conceal the fact she might need further . treatment. In May 2010 he . told her he did not know the tumour was present when he operated on her . and gave her another doctored pathology report with the author’s . signature ‘cut and pasted’ in. Opening . the case Craig Sephton QC, had earlier told the hearing: ‘This is a case where . it is difficult to understand why Mr Labram initially told the patient . and her husband that he had completely removed the lesion when he must . have known that no such thing had happened. ‘He . then lied and lied and lied in order to cover up his initial failure . and the GMC will therefore invite you to conclude that is what has . happened.’ Patient A . made a complaint, and the hospital’s medical director ordered an . investigation - but the doctor was able to continue working until . October last year, when he took early retirement. When . quizzed about his actions during an internal disciplinary meeting in . January 2011, Labram admitted his deception but said ‘he did not want to . cause further stress to the patient,’ the tribunal heard. Panel chairman Dr Howard Freeman said: ‘The panel considers that Mr Labram’s misconduct put Patient A at serious risk of harm, he abused his position of trust and he violated Patient A’s rights. ‘The panel is satisfied that Mr Labram’s conduct constitutes a very serious departure from the fundamental tenets of good medical practice. ‘Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Labram’s misconduct relates to a single episode it is concerned that his dishonest behaviour was persistent and covered up. Dr Freeman said: ‘The panel considers that Mr Labram has displayed a reckless disregard for the principles set out in good medical practice. ‘The panel is of the view that patients and the public are entitled to expect medical practitioners to act with integrity. ‘It considers that Mr Labram has abused the position of trust which the public are entitled to place int he medical profession and that his behavior is unacceptable and fundamentally incompatible with his continued registration.’ Dr Freeman explained that the panel had taken into account Labram’s ‘long and distinguished career’ into account, including a period where he was the only surgeon involved in spinal intra-medullary lesions in the North East of Scotland. But his misconduct was so serious, the chairman said, that it was fundamentally incompatible with him continuing to work as a doctor. ‘The panel is of the view that Mr Labram’s behaviour would be regarded as deplorable by fellow practitioners and by the public.’","Emmanuel Labram told patient she did not need further treatment .

Anyone in the world could soon have access to a 3D printable gun through the internet thanks to  a U.S. start-up which plans to distribute schematics for the weapons free of charge. Defense Distributed, a company which wants to extend the U.S. Second Amendment rights to the entire world, hopes to test prototypes of the printable weapons by the end of the year. 'This project could very well change the way we think about gun control and consumption,' the organisation says on their website. 'How do governments behave if they . must one day operate on the assumption that any and every citizen has . near instant access to a firearm through the Internet? Let’s find out.' Cody Wilson, a spokesman for the so-called 'Wiki Weapon' project, told guardian.co.uk that the organisation is only waiting on a license to allow them to legally manufacture firearms in the U.S. They . have already come up with two blueprints for plastic firearms, but now . needs to test the designs to ensure they are safe to use when printed on . less-expensive 3D printers. 'These guns will be almost completely plastic, so melting and failing in your hand will be a concern,' Defense Distributed says. 'Only . after testing a few dozen designs to failure will we discover the right . limitations to be comfortable rating a WikiWep as safe for one use.' It adds: 'We want to minimize negative media about the safety concerns of untested firearms and the inevitable suggestions that governments should protect us from ourselves.' The group so far claims to have developed two prototype plastic handguns. The first, called Wiki Weapon type A, is a training gun with no moving parts. It relies on an electrical solenoid to fire bullets but the rest of the weapon is 3D printable. The more ambitious Wiki Weapon type B will have movable parts, but the organisation hopes to refine these to make it possible to print them on entry-level 3D printers that can be used at home. They promise that blueprints usable in computer aided design programs will be available to download from their website 'in the coming weeks'. A third project allows users to print the regulated part of an AR-15 submachine gun, then build the rest from unregulated parts freely available in U.S. gun shops. Open source: The organisation plans to distribute the schematics for 3D printable guns as files for computer aided design programs which are compatible with entry-level 3D printers . The researchers behind the Wiki Weapon project had initially hoped to create and test their prototypes without a licence, but intense media interest has led to problems which threatened to derail their progress. The group's account on crowd-funding website Indiegogo was in September frozen and nearly $2,000 already raised was returned to donors and last month the company from which they had planned to lease the equipment to create their first prototypes repossessed its printer, the Guardian reported. Two Texas-based companies, whose names are not known, have since volunteered space and a 3D printer for the Wiki Weapon team to carry out manufacturing and ballistics testing. The organisation, which began as a loose online collective, has restructured and registered with the U.S. government to ensure there are no more legal barriers. 'I have no interest in going to jail,' Mr Wilson said. 'I'll do it their way if I need to.' Bypassing regulation: Printable plans for this lower-end receiver part for an AR-15 submachine gun are already on offer from the organisation. Once printed, the rest of the gun can be assembled from parts freely available in shops in the U.S. Wiki Weapon's designs are intended for printing on the kinds of 3D printers available to hobbyists, such as the RepRap - a low-cost open source prototyping system designed to be easily distributed. The people behind the project see it as the ultimate expression of free speech, with the advent of 3D printing representing the kind of advance that the orginal printing press gave to society. Answering the question 'why guns?', Defense Distributed says on its website: 'Guns prove out some of our younger generations’ beliefs about information and sharing at an extremity. 'If we truly believe information should be free, that the internet is the last bastion of freedom and knowledge, and that societies that share are superior to societies that censor and withhold, then why not guns?' Mr Wilson added: 'Consider this: a CAD file containing the information for a 3D printable weapons system. 'If that file was seeded by 30 people, let's say, as long as there is a free internet thhat file is available to anyone at any time, all over the world. 'Now that gun can be anywhere. Any bullet is now a weapon.' 'But Defence Distributed's goal is not really personal armament, it's more the liberation of information. It's about living in a world where you just download the file for the thing you want to make. '[Just] As the printing press revolutionised literacy, 3D printing is in its moment.'","Defense Distributed hopes to begin testing prototypes this year .

"A woman has accused a barber shop of sexism after they refused to cut her hair - because she wasn’t a man. Alice O’Toole wanted to get her 5in-long blonde hair shaved off and patterns shaved into her hair but was left angry and confused' when staff at a barbers told her: 'We don’t do girls'. Miss O’Toole said she felt 'humiliated' after asking for a Grade 2 or 3 cut with hair stenciling at Razor’s Edge barbers in Portsmouth, Hampshire. Teaching assistant Alice O'Toole said she felt 'humiliated' after she was refused a Grade 2 or 3 cut with hair stenciling because the barbers did not 'do girls' The 21-year-old teaching assistant said: 'I do a lot of exercise and got a bit fed up with getting hot all the time. 'So I decided to get my head shaved and possibly get some hair art, with tribal patterns cut into it. 'I’d heard Razor’s Edge had a very good reputation so decided it would be the perfect place to nip into, but when I went in they refused to serve me. The 21-year-old later got a tribal pattern at another barber shop . 'They refused in front of a shop full of people, which was very embarrassing - on the grounds that I’m a woman. 'I already had very short hair, so it wasn’t a particularly big job I was asking them to do. 'I thought nothing of going to a barber’s, essentially I wanted a haircut that is typically given to men so surely the best place to go was a barber’s. 'But apparently not. I was told they would not give me essentially a male haircut as I am a woman. 'The receptionist looked very embarrassed as I asked for an explanation and all she could offer is ""We don’t do girls"", whatever the cut. 'When I asked wasn’t this a bit sexist even she admitted it was. It’s not like I asked for a perm or a girl’s haircut. 'My immediate reaction was: ‘Are you joking?’. It was so humiliating to be told that in front of a shop of 15 people, plus staff, all looking at me. 'I walked out and went to the nearest hairdressers and they gave me a Grade 2, but couldn’t offer the hair art so I didn’t get what I wanted. 'The staff there were disgusted at the way I’d been treated.' Under the Equality Act 2010, businesses must now justify giving a single-sex service. This means, for example, a barber shop might say they could not give a woman a perm because it was a style they would not normally do. Razor's Edge Portsmouth has apologised and the manager said the barber's does not operate a no-women policy or sexist agenda . Razor’s Edge, in Portsmouth, Hampshire, today apologised and insisted they do not have a 'sexist agenda'. In a statement, manager Lloyd Hughes said: 'We had a no women policy introduced 20 years ago after being threatened with legal action after trimming a girl’s fringe. 'If we have inadvertently broken the law we will endeavour to put this right immediately. 'The member of staff who served Alice has unfortunately shown ignorance of this change of law in 2010, which we support. 'We do not operate a no-women policy or sexist agenda. 'Cutting women’s and men’s hair does require very different skills and knowledge and hairdressers across the world are trained up specifically as a male or female cutter. 'However we should have provided that service because Alice asked for a men’s cut. 'I am deeply embarrassed and have apologised personally to her. 'She was let down by ignorance of the law and poor customer service.' Miss O’Toole, from Gosport, Hampshire, later got a tribal freehand pattern at another barber shop, which she is happy with. She added: 'I was angry and confused as to why I was refused service just because I am a woman. 'I was willing to pay good money for my haircut and give someone the opportunity to get creative with some stencilling in my hair. 'I’ve got no problem with going into a salon and seeing a man getting his haircut there, so why can’t I have the same treatment? 'Lots of women have said to me they have had a similar experience, but if a man can get the same cut there’s no way a business can justify turning a woman away.'","Alice O'Toole wanted her 5in-long hair shaved off and patterns shaved into it .

"Growing numbers of drug-resistant diseases could trigger an ‘apocalyptic scenario’ comparable to a catastrophic terrorist attack, Britain’s chief medical officer warned yesterday. Dame Sally Davies said there was risk that within 20 years people going for simple operations would die of routine infections because we may ‘run out of antibiotics’ that work. She told MPs the threat from infections that are resistant to antibiotics was so serious that the issue should be added to the Government’s national risk register of civil emergencies. There is a risk that within 20 years, people going for simple operations may die of routine infections due to a lack of effective antibiotics . The register was established in 2008 to advise the public and businesses on national emergencies that Britain could face in the next five years. The highest priority risks on the latest register include a deadly flu outbreak and catastrophic terrorist attacks. Speaking to MPs on the Commons science . and technology committee, Davies said she would ask the Cabinet Office . to add antibiotic resistance to the national risk register in the light of an annual report on infectious disease she will publish in March. A Department of Health spokesperson told . MailOnline the publication would coincide with a government strategy to . promote more responsible use of antibiotics among doctors. She said: 'We are broadly . concerned about antibiotic resistance and we are going to be publishing a . strategy in March with guidance on this.' Hospital superbugs such as MRSA are some of the best known antibiotic-resistant diseases, but MPs were warned about infections such as gonorrhea and TB that affect the general population. Some antibiotics have already been lost to resistance. Some antibiotics have already been lost to resistance, for example penicillin is no longer effective for some wound infections . Penicillin is no longer effective for staphylococcal wound infections, ampicillin (a form of penicillin) is no longer used for infections of the urinary tract and ciprofloxacin (a synthetic antibiotic) is now useless in treating gonorrhoea. Many more are under threat. New antibiotics are hard to find and to licence, the Health Protection Agency has warned. From the 1940s to the 1990s the answer was to develop new antibiotics, but this development has slowed. New antibiotics are less profitable than treatments for chronic diseases, and much of the pharmaceutical industry now concentrates on other areas of medicine. Dame Sally told the Commons Science and Technology Committee: ‘We need to get our act together in this country.’ She said: 'There are few public health issues of potentially greater importance for society than antibiotic resistance. It means we are at increasing risk  of developing infections that cannot be treated – but resistance can be managed. 'Antibiotics are losing their effectiveness at a rate that is both alarming and irreversible – similar to global warming. 'I urge patients and prescribers to think about the drugs they are requesting and dispensing. 'Bacteria are adapting and finding ways to survive the effects of antibiotics, ultimately becoming resistant so they no longer work. And the more you use an antibiotic, the more bacteria become resistant to it.' Changes in modern medicine have exacerbated the problem by making patients more susceptible to infections. For example, cancer treatments weaken the immune system, and the use of catheters increases the chances of bugs entering the bloodstream. David Heymann, Chairman of the HPA said: 'Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem and it requires an international solution to tackle it. sistance and suggests ways that could help to form a basis for action to address them. 'Bacteria will always evolve to become resistant and this is a natural part of the cycle of evolution but by reducing the pressures that cause resistance we can help to preserve the antibiotics that we do have and no-one can underestimate how important this is. 'Tackling this problem is going to require effort from individuals, organisations and nations alike. But by working together we can help to combat this problem.'","Dame Sally Davies said people may die from routine infections after surgery within 20 years .

"There is no link between mobile phones and any health problems, a decade-long report has concluded. The study also found no evidence that exposure to base station emissions during pregnancy increases the risk of childhood leukaemia. The Mobile Telecommunications and Health . Research programme was the UK’s largest research programme to look at . the possible health risks associated with mobile phone technology. There is no link between mobile phone use and cancer, new research suggests . Professor David Coggon, Chairman of MTHR, said: ‘When the MTHR programme was first set up, there were many scientific uncertainties about possible health risks from mobile phones and related technology. ‘This independent programme is now complete, and despite exhaustive research, we have found no evidence of risks to health from the radio waves produced by mobile phones or their base stations. ‘Thanks to the research conducted within the programme, we can now be much more confident about the safety of modern telecommunications systems.’ The £13.6 million, 11 year programme has been jointly funded by the UK government and the telecommunications industry. Its findings support 2012 research which showed mobile and Wi-Fi technology doesn't cause cancer and causes no damage to health. There is also no link between exposure to power lines during pregnancy and childhood leukaemia . After assessing health hazards from low-level electromagnetic fields generated by radio transmitters, researchers at the Norwegian Expert Committee found there is no scientific evidence that exposure  poses a health risk. These electromagnetic fields are found around mobile phones, wireless phones and networks, mobile phone base stations, broadcasting transmitters and other communications equipment. The latest research also supports a 2011 study from Imperial College London which found that living close to a mobile phone mast does not increase a child's chance of developing a brain tumour or a tumour of the central nervous system. In 2011 the WHO suggested that people try to text rather than making phone calls to reduce their chance of developing a brain tumour from phone use . Study author Professor Paul Elliott of Imperial College London, said: 'People are worried that living near a mobile phone mast might affect their children's health. 'We looked at this question with respect to risk of cancers in young children. 'We found no pattern to suggest that the children of mums living near a base station during pregnancy had a greater risk of developing cancer than those who lived elsewhere.' Research released just last week also revealed that children who live near overhead power lines do not have an increased risk of leukaemia. The University of Oxford researchers studied 16,500 children with the cancer in the UK and found living near power lines did not increase risk of the disease. Despite all of this evidence, some people may remain unconvinced. In 2011 the World Health Organisation warned mobile phone users to limit their use of the devices as they could cause cancer. The WHO suggested people use hands-free kits and that they text people instead of calling them to reduce their exposure to the phone. The comments were made after earlier research which suggested that just half an hour's mobile phone use a day could increase the risk of a brain tumour by 40 per cent.","There is 'no evidence' to suggest that exposure to base station emissions during pregnancy increases the risk of childhood leukaemia .

"Edward Snowden has revealed his long-term girlfriend was 'not entirely pleased' with the saga that forced them to flee their home in Hawaii. The former . National Security Agency contractor was finally reunited with pole dancer Lindsay Mills this July in Moscow, where he is claiming asylum. In a new documentary, the couple are pictured together for the first time in more than a year, looking settled and homely in their Russian apartment. But last night Snowden conceded that his other half did not take the life change lightly. 'She was not entirely pleased [with what happened],' he told an audience in New York from an undisclosed location via webcam. Scroll down for video . Reunited: A new documentary Citizen Four reveals footage (pictured) of Edward Snowden and Lindsay Mills cooking in their wood-paneled apartment in Moscow where the former NSA contractor has claimed asylum . 'Incredible reunion': The former NSA contractor gushed about the support he has received from his pole dancer girlfriend (pictured in 2012) since fleeing the United States in 2013 - although he concedes she wasn't pleased . 'But at the same time, it was an incredible reunion because she understood me, and that meant a lot to me.' His words came as a documentary about his time on the run from US authorities, Citizen Four, was premiered. It is more than a year since Snowden leaked classified details of the US government's surveillance programs - prompting a warrant for his arrest under the Espionage Act. Mills had initially stayed behind in Hawaii, where the two had lived together, in the wake of the political firestorm unleashed last summer. But now the couple look set to now stay in Russia for up to three years under the residency granted by Vladimir Putin who agreed to offer political asylum. Snowden also admitted in the webcam interview at the New Yorker Festival that he misses America - a place he may never return to, Politico reported. 'The question is what don't I miss, whether it's my family, whether it's my home, whether it's my friends, whether it's my work at the agency, I was fulfilled and happy,' he responded. 'Things as simple as having my old beat-up car, there's a lot to miss. It's a great country.' Leaker: Snowden, left, who has claimed political asylum in Vladimir Putin's Russia, has been reunited with his pole-dancing girlfriend Lindsay Mills, right . Leaker: Snowden, who handed over huge amounts of classified information from the National Security Agency, stars in a new documentary which reveals he is living with his girlfriend under Putin's protection in Russia . Together again: The two, pictured on a Hawaiian beach before Snowden fled the U.S., have moved to Russia . Mills had remained silent and her whereabouts were largely . unknown after Snowden's release of tens of thousands of . classified U.S. intelligence documents in 2013. Citizen Four, made by U.S. film maker Laura Poitras, premiered on Friday in New York, revealing Mills's location in the process. It shows the couple cooking in their wood-paneled Moscow apartment, which is decorated with plants. The dramatic shift from his seemingly idyllic life in Hawaii was far greater than Snowden had predicted, he said last night. 'It was about getting the information back to people so they could decide if they cared about it, and on that account … I could not have been more wrong in thinking that people wouldn't care,' he explained. 'NSA employees have used this surveillance power to spy on exes, to spy on lovers, and that’s a felony, however none of them were prosecuted because it was considered that the value of the programs was greater than the interests of justice.' Incredibly, he also revealed he disagreed with a number of the articles written by the journalists he leaked the data to. 'Do I agree with all of the stories that the journalists have presented? I don't,' he said. 'I would draw those lines a little differently, and I think much more conservatively than some of the journalists have,' without identifying specific stories. The film also suggests that there could be a second NSA leaker waiting in the wings, who had access to far more information that Snowden. It came as a top spy revealed how Snowden's leaked documents have made the job of monitoring terrorists far more difficult. Sir Iain Lobban, the outgoing head of the British government's NSA equivalent, GCHQ, revealed that since the revelations it now takes three times as long to complete routine monitoring tasks. An unnamed employee made the revelation as part of the interview and profile of the GCHQ service in the Daily Telegraph. Moscow living: Snowden pictured on the Moscow river in Russia's capital where he sought asylum from the US . In love: The pair are pictured frolicking together before he fled the United States . Secrecy: Snowden hid his identity when speaking to journalists, using the name Citizenfour - now the film's title . Hollywood treatment: The Snowden film will show in theaters later this month . Dancer: Mills, pictured left and right in an online video, is filmed cooking with Snowden in the documentary . The new film is a fly-on-the wall account of Snowden's tense days . in a Hong Kong hotel and his encounters with journalists from . the Washington Post and the Guardian as they prepared to print protected information on NSA activities. It puts a Hollywood glamour on the former contractor, who is shown wearing contact lenses rather than his traditional glasses, and wearing mousse in his hair. It also shows scenes of his relationship with Mills immediately after the links. She is shown telling him about agents showing up at their house after he didn't go to work - and also asking why his rent checks have stopped. At one point he tells the camera 'she has no idea' - but claims he used the cover of going to Hong Kong on vacation to protect her. Citizenfour takes its title from the email alias that . Snowden used when he first approached Poitras in early 2013 . through a series of encrypted emails - with a view to leaking . details of the top-secret programs to the media. Marketed as a 'real-life thriller,' it is the first of . several films in the works about Snowden, who is wanted by . the United States on charges brought under the Espionage Act. Speaking in the film, Snowden says: 'I already know how this will end for me, and I accept the . risk. Parents: Snowden's mother Karen, left, and father Lonnie, right, pose with director Laura Poitras, center, after the screening of the film . Poitras, speaking after the screening, said: 'This was a film we had to make as privately and secretly as . we could.' 'We very much wanted to communicate in this film that [it] was about people who take risks and come forward at huge . personal sacrifice.' Director: Citizenfour, the Snowden documentary, was made by Laura Poitras . Poitras, an American, now lives in Berlin, Germany. She has been . stopped and questioned when entering the U.S. numerous times in . the past 10 years. Snowden's revelations sparked a global debate on the limits . of privacy versus the needs of national security. His critics view him as a traitor who refuses to face trial in the U.S. for his actions, while supports see him as a hero who spoke up for civil . liberties. Journalist Glenn Greenwald, who along with Poitras was . Snowden's first points of contact with the media, said he hoped . that Citizenfour would allow the public to form their own . opinion about the man and his motives. He said: 'So much has been said about Ed Snowden, a lot of it bad but . a lot of it really good. 'I felt like this was really the first . time that people got to see who he really is so that they could . make up their own mind. 'I always felt... that the most powerful part of the story . was not going to be the documents and the revelations but the . power of the story and the acts of this very, kind of ordinary . young man, who decided very consciously to sacrifice his whole . life for a political principle.'

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits they cannot afford to give out-of-form striker Romelu Lukaku a much-needed rest. The Belgium international has scored just twice since he moved to Goodison Park from Chelsea on a permanent £28million deal in the summer. At this stage 12 months ago he had twice as many goals while playing on loan for the Toffees, but Martinez believes last season's exertions followed immediately by the World Cup have taken their toll on the 21-year-old. Romelu Lukaku has struggled for form since joining Everton from Chelsea this summer in a £28million move . However, with Arouna Kone still not fit after a serious knee injury almost exactly a year ago, Steven Naismith operating better in a slightly deeper role and 33-year-old Samuel Eto'o seen as a back-up, Martinez has had little option but to keep putting his club-record signing back in the firing line. The Spaniard admits he does not think leaving out Lukaku now will benefit him, but they will focus on getting him back to peak fitness in the next couple of weeks. 'Romelu is still finding his best moment of form,' he said. Everton manager Roberto Martinez said he will not rest the Belgian striker despite his poor form . 'Any player coming out of a World Cup always takes a transitional period to get their fitness back to normal. 'I think Rom has done incredibly to make himself available for the games we've had. 'Only (goalkeeper) Tim Howard has played the same amount of games and his desire to help the team has stopped him being able to concentrate on being fully fit. 'Over the next few weeks we are going to try to give him that physical element he needs, but he is a young man who will be an important player for us. The former Chelsea striker challenges Alberto Moreno during the Merseyside derby, which ended 1-1 . 'I think Rom needs to be playing and getting his match fitness and he is too important for, us so we can't afford to give him any resting period - I don't think that would help him.' Lukaku's lack of goals and defensive lapses have contributed to a haul of just six points from seven matches which has left Everton 17th in the table - a far cry from last season when they were in or just outside the top four for three-quarters of the campaign. Martinez accepts they have contributed to their own failings so far, but despite being much worse off position-wise than they were 12 months ago, he is not about to start re-evaluating his projections for the season. Martinez claimed that Lukaku's involvement in the World Cup was likely to have hindered his form this season . 'I still feel in the league we are still suffering from dropping four points in the two early games at Leicester and against Arsenal,' he said ahead of the visit of Aston Villa. 'It is not a moment to assess where we are in the league. It is a period where we are working to get ourselves in the best possible position before we start the final third. 'We're taking every game slowly and for us the only concentration is Aston Villa. 'Villa is the last team you want to play at home. They got a very good win at Stoke - we all know how difficult it is there - and then they went to Anfield and got an impressive result there.'","Romelu Lukaku has scored just twice since his £28million summer move .

"Chelsea old boy Frank Lampard admitted he was almost speechless after coming off the bench to deny former boss Jose Mourinho victory at Manchester City. The 36-year-old midfielder, who was serenaded by the visiting fans at the Etihad Stadium, struck five minutes from time after being picked out by James Milner to cancel out Andre Schurrle's 71st-minute opener. Lampard told Sky Sports: 'It's a really difficult one. I'd be unprofessional if I didn't come on and do my job, so I was trying to get into the box and it was a great ball back from Milly. Lampard arrives late in the box to score City's equaliser and deny Chelsea three points at the Etihad . The City midfielder looked close to tears after scoring a crucial goal against his former club . 'It's a tough one for me. I had 13 amazing years with the Chelsea fans, so I am mixed with it. I am obviously pleased the team I play for got a draw. 'I am a little lost for words. I didn't expect to come on and score like that. I came on and the Chelsea fans were singing, and that's emotional. Then I am playing for this club, who have taken me in brilliantly as well, so I am really stuck in the middle here.' Delighted City boss Manuel Pellegrini insisted he had no qualms about using Lampard after speaking to him before the game, during which City defender Pablo Zabaleta was dismissed for a second bookable offence. Lampard cannot bring himself to celebrate the all-important goal, his first for his new side, against Chelsea . Chelsea's travelling fans, though disappointed by the defeat, stayed behind to applaud their hero . He said: 'I asked him if he wanted to be involved, and of course he wanted to be involved. That shows how great a professional Lampard is. 'I am sure he was not happy to score against such an important team in his career, but he's a good professional, he is a very good player.' Opposite number Jose Mourinho, for whom Lampard was such a key figure during his first spell at Stamford Bridge, was pragmatic about the former England midfielder's contribution. Mourinho said: 'He is a Man City player. I don't believe in these histories of passion and heart, I don't believe in these. Maybe I am too pragmatic in football. 'When he decided to come to Man City, a direct competitor of Chelsea, love stories are over. He did his job as the super professional he is, and he did well.' Despite scoring against them, Lampard, Chelsea's record goalscorer, remains a legend to their fans . Lampard's former teammates Branislav Ivanovic and Andre Schurrle have seen him score all too often .

"A toddler has been left with a broken collar bone after he and his mother were attacked in broad daylight because the little boy appeared to be mixed race. The two-year-old was tipped out of his pushchair and injured when a black man started hurling racist abuse and then went for his 30-year-old mother at Highams Park railway station in east London. Police fear the suspect was attacking the unnamed woman, who is also black, because the child had lighter coloured skin and may have been mixed race. As the mother tried to get off the train the apparent racist grabbed her by the hair, dragging her to the ground and knocking over the pushchair, badly hurting the toddler.

"Lasse Schone's equaliser denied Zlatan Ibrahimovic victory on his old stomping ground as Ajax held Paris St Germain to a 1-1 Champions League draw. Denmark winger Schone levelled the match with Ajax's first shot on target, just when PSG were eyeing victory in their opening Group F encounter. Edinson Cavani blasted his 28th goal in 50 PSG appearances to hand the Frenchmen the lead, with Sweden striker Ibrahimovic looking likely to seal victory at his former club. Edinson Cavani opened the scoring after sweeping in the rebound from Zlatan Ibrahimovic's blocked shot . The 32-year-old former Ajax and Milan hitman mustered five of PSG's 10 shots on target, but his frustrations grew each time he was unable to find the net. Ajax found themselves in the fraught uphill struggle they had anticipated against the cash-rich French side, but were able to deny Ibrahimovic's men and salvage a creditable point. The Dutch hosts slipped behind after just 14 minutes when Cavani drove a low shot home following Ibrahimovic's blocked effort. Denmark winger LasseSchone levelled the match with a free-kick , which was Ajax's first shot on target . PSG players watch in horror as Schone's shot flies over the wall and into the back of the net . Laurent Blanc's visiting side have been tipped to feature among the contenders for this term's title given their spending power and all-star line-up. The potent Parisians were unable to find the right blend to see off Ajax however, and will view this draw as an early setback given their lofty tournament ambitions. Schone's equaliser stunned the visitors, the 28-year-old wrong-footing PSG keeper Salvatore Sirigu from a 20-yard free-kick.

"Jose Mourinho might not appreciate the comparison but right now his Chelsea team more closely resemble Newcastle United in their heady days under Kevin Keegan than anything he has assembled before. Chelsea so far are the great entertainers and have scored and conceded more goals after five matches than any previous Mourinho team. Wednesday night’s 1-1 draw against Schalke in the Champions League means Chelsea have found the net 16 times but had their own defence breached on seven occasions. VIDEO Scroll down to watch videos... Jose Mourinho is building a new Chelsea, who score goals but also concede more . Cesc Fabregas celebrates scoring against Schalke and (right) Diego Costa after a goal versus Swansea . Eden Hazard (left) is another of Chelsea's great entertainers and recently signed a new deal . Jose Mourinho's teams' records after five matches (Chelsea unless stated) 2014-15 - Goals Scored 16, Conceded 7 . 2013-14 - GS 6, GC 4 . 2012-13 - GS 7, GC 7 (Madrid) 2011-12 - GS 15, GC 6 (Madrid) 2010-11 - GS 8, GC 1 (Madrid) 2009-10 - GS 8, GC 3 (Inter) 2008-09 - Gs 10, GC 5 (Inter) 2007-08 - GS 8, GC 5 . 2006-07 - GS 9, GC 6 . 2005-06 - GS 10, GC 1 . 2004-05 - GS 6, GC 1 . 2003-04 - GS 10, GC 3 (Porto) For a man so focused on tactical tightness that total is anathema to Mourinho, even if his side remain unbeaten. Only in his 2011-12 season at Real Madrid has Mourinho started a season anywhere like this one at Stamford Bridge. Back then after five games in all competitions Real had scored 15 goals and conceded six. Ominous signals for the Premier League chasing pack; Real won La Liga that season, scoring a frankly ridiculous 121 times for a plus 89 goal difference to accrue 100 points. It was the season Lionel Messi bagged 50 league goals and Cristiano Roanldo 46. Radamel Falcao’s 24-goal offering for Atletico Madrid pales in comparison. Diego Costa has begun this campaign on such form, with seven goals in four starts before failing to find the winner against Schalke coming off the bench with 16 minutes remaining. His hamstrings prohibit excessive action each week and Mourinho must manage his £32million striker to ensure that if Chelsea fail to secure their backline, the Spain international can provide enough firepower to make amends. With Cesc Fabregas conducting from deep and Eden Hazard a devious presence further up, Chelsea will always carry a potent goal threat. Klaas Jan Huntelaar (obscured centre) scores for Schalke at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night . Gary Cahill (left) and John Terry (second right) are part of a settled Chelsea defence but they have let in seven . But those seven concessions will irritate Mourinho, who has opened this season with a settled back four in front of one of the world’s best goalkeepers. John Terry, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic, Cesar Azpilicueta, and Thibaut Courtois have started every Premier League game, with Filipe Luis slotting in at left back for Wednesday night’s game. That is a defence which should provide a solid base, but Everton penetrated it three times, Swansea twice and Burnley once. Their only clean sheet thus far has come at home to Leicester, who would have scored had David Nugent been cooler (or Courtois more panicked) when clean through. Nemanja Matic is the midfielder tasked with greatest defensive duty but he can bomb forward and leave spaces for counter-attacks to blossom. With Manchester City at the Etihad next up for Mourinho – the scene of a sophisticated 1-0 victory last term – it may be he returns to his favoured trivote formation of three deep midfielders, with John Obi Mikel recruited for added security. Mourinho’s first season at Chelsea saw six goals scored and just one conceded in the opening five games. They went on to win the title comfortably and efficiently. There is nothing efficient about scoring six to counteract three conceded, or four to beat two, and as the season progresses expect the Portuguese to tailor his team accordingly. Roman Abramovich has always wanted an exciting Chelsea team and it seems he is getting his wish .","Chelsea have scored 16 goals so far this season but have let in seven .

"Last night, Adrian Chiles got to step on the turf in Switzerland to begin his European Qualifying campaign on ITV. This he did alongside the three men with whom he had spent so much time on the Copacabana Beach in Brazil. Only now, Adrian and his crew of Glenn Hoddle, Ian Wright and Lee Dixon had stopped looking like four fellas at a stag weekend. And more like a quartet of ushers having a crafty fag outside the church before the bride turns up. And two of them, mind, in brown shoes with dark suits! Not naming names or anything, but shame on your Messrs Hoddle and Dixon! VIDEO Scroll down to watch England players stepped up - Hodgson . Larking about: Lee Dixon, Glenn Hoddle and Chiles see the funny side of their soaking . Knowing look: Adrian Chiles turns around to see what all the commotion is about . Getting wet: ITV's quartet trying and cover themselves from the sprinkler . However, this familiar line up’s take on Roy’s race for a qualifying slot was not necessarily the most interesting one on our boxes last night. That one was potentially over on Sky Sports. Where an overblown set that looked like University Challenge on steroids included the rather unique sight of the now internationally retired John Terry as a pundit. A potential banana skin? Well, of course yes. Even if by the simple fact of his being there. I’m sure JT will, as ever, ‘divide opinion’. But don’t be fooled into thinking that it was only Sky Sports who might end being the victim of a discarded custard-coloured carcass. ITV also had some crazy moves last night. And one of them, our host DEFINITELY saw it coming. Almost perfectly, as the pundits were setting up the game, you could see that Adrian had noticed out the corner of his eye that the pitch sprinklers were suddenly in full flow. And if there’s one thing Adrian enjoys even above telling ex-professionals about football (but wouldn’t we all?), it’s finding the funny thing. Yet in spite of the temptation before him, he still managed to stay on topic. Even if he was twitching away as if on hot coals, so eager was he to talk about what was going on off piste. Which is clearly his schtick, and something he loves to do. And what’s more, he delivered. Because just as the sprinklers came around again, there was a soaking for everyone. Adrian was in his element as the misty water showered down, and led into a break enthusing wildly about this slapstick moment. Short of a clown turning up pitchside in a collapsing car and slapping a custard pie in Lee Dixon’s face, this was clearly going to be his moment of the evening. Meanwhile over on Sky Sports, host David Jones seemed to think he had a bucket of water all ready to pour over John Terry’s head. Debut: John Terry was working as a pundit on television for the first time . Warm welcome: Terry said he'd had a 'great night' after posting this image to his official Instagram account . Opinions: Terry made an appearance in the Sky Sports studio to talk about Monday's international action . They were all watching Spain’s game against Macedonia. In which Sergio Ramos scored a rather audacious penalty. ‘How about that from a centre half?’, asked Jones - bucket poised under the cold tap. Swivelling uncomfortably in his chair, and looking across to his co-pundit Jamie Redknapp for reassurance, the best JT could muster in response was ‘the less said the better’. Clearly, it was STILL not time to talk about missed penalties. That phrase actually pretty much summed up John Terry’s international debut for Sky Sports. He always was has, and remains, the most stoic, no nonsense of centre halves. But if he intends to try and follow fellow defenders Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher into the broadcasting game, he’s going to have to learn a few more moves. The kind of mixture of media skills, hands on experience and steadfast opinion that his senior sidekick Jamie Redknapp has got nailed down, for me. It was fascinating watching Jamie and JT working together. Questions would be thrown at Terry, to which he would respond in a surprisingly quiet voice. Nerves were clearly an issue, which, yes, is fair enough at this stage in his experience. But even so, he rarely strayed from the ‘footballer’s handy cliches’ manual.

Morale-boost: Roy Hodgson celebrates during the 2-0 win, which lifted the post-World Cup gloom . VIDEO England players stepped up - Hodgson . So to help keep things moving, Jamie would pick up the thought, flesh it out with a bit of fact, and even, on occasion, turn it back into a question so that Terry could work with and pick up on. That clearly helped Terry settle down and give us a little more insight into what his actual thoughts were. And in the end, he would be right in thinking that he probably just about got away with that one. Although if he had been alongside Adrian and his box of tricks over on ITV, you may be right in thinking that would have been a different story!","Terry appeared alongside Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports on Monday night for his punditry debut .

Now captain under Louis van Gaal and celebrating a decade at Old Trafford, Rooney has thanked Ferguson for the pivotal role he played in his career. ‘He was vitally important,’ Rooney told MUTV in an interview to mark his 10 years at the club. ‘I’m grateful to him for having the faith to bring me in from Everton. ‘I think he’s an incredible person and manager, the way you see his desire for the game.

I remember being nervous but he was great and made me feel comfortable. ‘I’m a strong-minded person and sometimes you have to make tough decisions. No-one else could make it for me.

'He's built up from the lower reaches, he's handled every level and players want to play for him.' Warnock, who himself has been in management for 34 years, recalled a previous meeting he had with Martinez. 'I remember saying to him, ""do you ever shout?"" He is such a gentleman but he does care and he's very passionate. You see it occasionally, he just lets it slip. 'I think we all have our ways and I think everyone cares differently - it doesn't mean because you rant and rave on the touchline you're more passionate than somebody who never says a word.' Warnock and Palace travel to Goodison Park on Sunday looking to recreate their 2-3 win from last season, but are sweating on the fitness of Marouane Chamakh, who missed last week's draw against Burnley with a hamstring injury.

There seemed almost too many Real Madrid players in the six-yard box with Ronaldo even barging his own team-mate Coentrao as they attempted unsuccessfully to defend the corner. Real Madrid tried to hit back immediately but James Rodriguez blasted over from a Ronaldo pass and Benzema was also wasteful. Sections of the Bernabeu were booing Casillas’ every touch despite it being 15 years almost to the day since he made his debut for the club. The match was still scrappy with Ramos colliding with Mandzukic and Godin going into the book for a foul on Ronaldo. Bale’s free-kick was well saved by Miguel Moya. The next important foul would be inside in the area and would give Real Madrid a way back into the game. Siqueira brought down Ronaldo and was booked and the Portuguese scored from the spot. Real Madrid should have extended their lead but Benzema’s header was saved at point-blank range from Moya. Atletico had faded badly towards the end of the first period and when Mandzukic clattered his former Bayern Munich team-mate Kroos he became the third Atletico player to be booked.

Atletico Madrid enjoy taking the lead at the Bernabeu as Mario Mandzukic joins his new team-mates in celebration after Real Madrid went 1-0 down . Tiago's header gave Atletico Madrid a surprise lead at the Bernabeu on Saturday night as they silenced the Real Madrid crowd . Atletico Madrid reportedly took just 50 travelling fans to the Bernabeu but each one of those left more than satisfied by what they'd seen at the Bernabeu . The kicking continued into the second half with Gabi booked for a foul on James and Arbeloa yellow-carded for a foul on Gimenez. Neither side got into their stride and it was Atletico Madrid who made the first change with Arda Turan coming on for Gabi but it was not long before Javier Hernandez was stripping off and replacing Benzema. James headed a Ronaldo cross over but still both sides huffed and puffed with limited end product – maybe a symptom of having played each other seven times now this calendar year. Bale was the next to make way with Isco replacing him. But the midfielder’s first effort was a curling shot that floated harmlessly wide. Far closer was Turan’s shot at the other end after he was shown inside. And the Turkish midfielder went one better minutes later when Juanfran crossed from the right, Raul Garcia dummied and Turan shot past Casillas to leave Real Madrid floundering in midtable after three games played.

"If you have ever wondered what happens in the build-up to a Barclays Premier League match, wonder no more. The process is mapped out with military precision, from the time the line-ups have to be declared to when the coin toss is - to the second - and half-time is EXACTLY 15 minutes. Queens Park Rangers tweeted a picture of the regulations before their clash with Stoke, giving fans an insight into how their heroes prepare in those crucial minutes prior to a match. The sheet tweeted by QPR detailing the process before their match with Stoke . The teams have a half-an-hour warm-up period before heading back to the dressing room 15 minutes before the match.

"England captain Wayne Rooney has been holding player-only meetings in a bid to put the summer's disastrous World Cup behind them. This has been a long, testing summer for the Three Lions, whose miserable campaign in Brazil led to the development of an understandably downbeat mood in the camp. There were promising signs on Monday night, though, as Roy Hodgson's men kicked off their European Championship qualifying campaign with a 2-0 win against much-fancied Switzerland. Captain fantastic: England skipper Wayne Rooney has been holding player-only meetings . Rooney believes it was England's most accomplished showing since they overcame Brazil 2-1 at Wembley in February 2013 and was quick to praise his team-mates after the St Jakob-Park encounter. While the Three Lions skipper won his 97th cap, the rest of the line-up had just 186 appearances between them - a lack of experience which led him to hold player-led meetings. 'We have worked hard and, to be fair, the players have taken a lot of responsibility,' Rooney said. 'We have had meetings among ourselves, just players in the rooms, watching videos and discussing how we can do better as a team. Leading the way: Rooney revealed the England players have discussed how they can play as a better team . 'Obviously the manager gives us our game plan, but because we don't spend that much time together as a team we need to know and feel confident in what we're doing as a team together. 'In the meetings, you're having the players speak up who wouldn't normally speak up when coaches are there. 'They've been good and I think the players have really stood up. We've worked hard.' An outstanding performer in Basle was deep-lying midfielder Fabian Delph, starting his first match for England having only made his debut as a second-half substitute against Norway last week. Delph was booked early on and looked in danger of a red card at one stage, but grew in composure and presence as the game progressed. 'He was brilliant,' Rooney said of the Aston Villa midfielder. 'His energy, he took the ball. Early on he had to be a bit careful. Full of energy: Fabian Delph's display for England against Switzerland impressed captain Rooney . 'The referee said to me at half-time to have a word with him, but I think he knew anyway. 'I spoke to him and told him just to be careful because I think one more and he would have probably been off. 'But he played really well, took the ball, played with confidence and showed what a top player he is.'","Wayne Rooney has been holding player-only meetings with England squad .

"David Cameron today lashed out at Russia's 'illegal' intervention in Ukraine . David Cameron today accused Russia of sending its tanks across the border into Ukraine in a ‘completely unacceptable and illegal’ invasion. The Prime Minister threatened ‘further consequences’ if Vladimir Putin failed to pull back his forces. Mr Cameron’s remarks came as 1,000 Russian troops crossed the border into Ukraine, according to Nato. A further 20,000 Russian troops are stationed just across the border. The Prime Minister said Mr Putin's claims to desire a peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine are ‘not credible’ while tanks roll across the border. The Prime Minister said he was ‘extremely concerned’ about reports of major troop movements from Russia into south eastern Ukraine and warned the activity must stop immediately. The crisis in Ukraine will be at the top of the agenda of next week's Nato summit in Wales, where Mr Cameron will meet with other alliance members to discuss collective security at Europe's eastern border. In a statement, Mr Cameron said: ‘I'm extremely concerned by mounting evidence that Russian troops have made large-scale incursions into South Eastern Ukraine, completely disregarding the sovereignty of a neighbour. ‘The international community has already warned Russia that such provocative actions would be completely unacceptable and illegal.' He added: ‘President Putin has said that Russia is willing to find a peaceful solution to the conflict but this is not credible when Russia is supporting pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine with arms and troops. 'It is simply not enough to engage in talks in Minsk, while Russian tanks continue to roll over the border into Ukraine. Such activity must cease immediately. Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko (left) has accused Russia of invading. Vladimir Putin (right) has rejected the accusation, despite Nato saying 1,000 Russian troops had crossed the border . Attack: A video image said to show a Russian tank on Ukrainian territory yesterday . ‘We urge Russia to pursue a different path and to find a political solution to this crisis. If Russia does not, then she should be in no doubt that there will be further consequences.’ Earlier, Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko said: ‘Russian forces have entered Ukraine.’ Mr Poroshenko summoned his national security council as the strategic south-eastern town of Novoazovsk appeared firmly under the control of separatists and their Russian backers. The moves open a new front in the war in eastern Ukraine between the separatists and his government in Kiev. Speaking at Nato headquarters, Brigadier General Nico Tak, Dutch commander of Nato's crisis operations centre, said the ultimate aim of Russia was to stave off defeat for the separatists and turn eastern Ukraine into a ‘frozen conflict’ that would destabilise the country ‘indefinitely’.
