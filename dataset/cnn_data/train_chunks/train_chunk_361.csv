"(CNN) -- It seemed too good to be true. Andy Kaufman still alive. The Internet erupted with the buzz after Kaufman's brother read a letter purportedly from Andy at a comedy club on Monday night and introduced a 24-year-old woman as his brother's daughter. But almost as quickly as reports surfaced Thursday, the news seemed to fizzle, with Michael Kaufman telling CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that he believes he's the victim of a hoax. ""Now that it's Thursday, not Monday anymore, I believe I am part of a hoax,"" Kaufman said in a bizarre, rambling interview where he spoke in a monotone not unlike his brother. ""I don't believe she's acting on her own, though,"" Kaufman said of the woman he introduced Monday night.

"Kenner, Louisiana (CNN) -- BP and Transocean managers had a dispute over drilling plans the day of the explosion that destroyed the oil rig Deepwater Horizon and unleashed a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the rig's chief mechanic recounted Wednesday. Douglass Brown said he didn't pay attention to details of the dispute, ""because it's not my department."" But he told a Coast Guard-Interior Department investigative board that the ""scrimmage"" between BP's site manager and the Transocean team that ran the drill rig had to do with replacing fluid in the pipes that led to the undersea well, 5,000 feet below the rig. ""The driller was outlining what would be taking place, whereupon the [BP] company man stood up and said, 'No, we have some changes to that,'"" Brown testified. He said Transocean's team, including its offshore installation manager, or OIM, and drill operator, ""had a disagreement with that."" ""I remember there was a slight argument that took place, and a difference of opinions, and the company man was basically saying, 'Well, this is how it's going to be,' and the toolpusher and the OIM reluctantly agreed,"" Brown said. After the meeting, installation manager Jimmy Harrell told him, ""I guess that's what we have those pinchers for"" -- which Brown said he took as a reference to the rams on the rig's blowout preventer, a piece of equipment designed to slam shut the drill pipe and cut off the well in case of emergency. That blowout preventer failed in the April 20 explosion and fire that sank the rig, which BP leased from Brown's employer, Transocean. BP, Transocean and oilfield services contractor Halliburton, which ran cementing operations on the well, have blamed each other for the disaster, which left 11 men dead and uncapped an undersea gusher that BP has so far failed to stop. BP would not comment on Brown's account, citing the pending investigation. Harrell and the Deepwater Horizon's captain, Curt Kutcha, are scheduled to appear before the investigative board on Thursday. Carl Smith, a rig captain and consultant who appeared before the panel Wednesday, said arguments between oil companies and rig crews happen periodically, and sometimes the two sides become ""outright adversaries."" ""The people who are renting it want to go faster to drill and the people that are operating the rig want to maintain the integrity of the rig, which is a natural conflict,"" he said. But most oil company representatives he has worked with are ""very safety-conscious,"" he said. On Tuesday, congressional investigators reported that the oil giant had three indications of trouble aboard the rig in the 51 minutes before the explosion in the form of anomalous pressure readings and surges of drilling fluid from the well. Pressure on the drill pipe ""unexpectedly increased"" before the blast, the committee reported, citing BP's preliminary investigation. BP's findings also ""raised concerns about the maintenance history, modification, inspection, and testing"" of the blowout preventer. As other witnesses have testified, Brown said the explosion occurred shortly after a roar of gas erupted from the well. ""We started hearing gas alarms go off. Gas alarms kept piling up on top of each other, more and more and more,"" he said. ""Over the radio I heard the captain or chief mate, I'm not sure who, make an announcement to the standby boat, the Bankston, saying that we are in a well-control situation."" Shortly after that, the rig's engines revved up sharply and then tripped, leaving the platform in the dark, Brown said. ""Right on the end of that was the first explosion,"" he said. ""The first explosion basically threw me up against the control panel that I was standing in front of, and a hole opened up underneath me and I fell down into the hole, into the subfloor where all the cable trays and wires are located at."" Brown said he managed to reach the main deck with another crew member, where they saw the rig's derrick ablaze and found ""complete chaos"" on Deepwater Horizon's bridge. ""They were trying to get systems going. They were trying to get control back,"" he said. Kutcha told him to abandon ship, so he headed to the lifeboats. ""It was just complete mayhem. Chaos,"" he said. ""People were scared, they were crying. I heard later that some were jumping overboard.""

"(CNN) -- Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman will face charges in Mexico before any possibility of extradition, Mexico's ambassador to the United States said Tuesday. ""Mr. Guzman still has pending time to serve in Mexico from his original sentence and he also faces new charges in Mexico that will be processed in Mexican federal courts,"" Ambassador Eduardo Medina-Mora said in a statement. ""If and when we receive an extradition request, it will be analyzed by the appropriate Mexican legal authorities and if granted, Mexico will decide upon the right moment to execute that possible extradition request."" The ambassador's statement came on the same day that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called his counterpart in Mexico to congratulate him on Guzman's capture, according to the Justice Department. Also Tuesday, federal prosecutors in New York unveiled the latest indictment naming Guzman, alleging drug trafficking and money laundering. There are at least seven indictments against Guzman in various U.S. jurisdictions, and at least one U.S. attorney's office has said it plans to seek extradition. ""Bilateral security and justice cooperation between Mexico and the United States unfolds in a mature and serene way, and cases like Mr. Guzman's are processed with openness. I think that the charges he faces in Mexico will be processed first and an eventual extradition request would be considered at the appropriate time,"" Medina-Mora said. ""Mr. Guzman could eventually face the charges against him in the U.S., after facing the charges against him in Mexico."" When Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001, he had served seven years of a 20-year, nine-month sentence. There were eight warrants for Guzman's arrest when authorities captured him over the weekend: two tied to his 2001 escape, and six more for alleged crimes committed since then, Mexico's attorney general's office said. Guzman's attorneys have already filed a motion to block his extradition. Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Sunday that Mexican officials should consider extradition now. ""The normal sequence is Mexico, being a sovereign nation, has the first prosecution. However, there's a history here. He escaped from a prison in 2001. There is corruption in that country. And I would ask that the Mexicans consider extraditing him to the United States, where he will be put into a 'supermax' prison under tight security, where he cannot escape, and be brought to justice with a life sentence,"" McCaul told ABC's ""This Week."" ""I think that would be the best course of action for not only Mexico, but also the United States, in ensuring that what happened in 2001 does not happen again."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and CNNMexico's Rodrigo Aguiar contributed to this report.","Ambassador: ""Mr. Guzman still has pending time to serve in Mexico""

"(CNN) -- The embattled head of the Phoenix VA was formally fired Monday. Sharon Helman was in charge of the Phoenix VA Health Care System and the facility at the center of the VA scandal; she was put on administrative leave following a CNN interview in April, in which she denied the existence of a secret list used to cover up delays in patient care. When asked by CNN's Drew Griffin if the Phoenix VA intentionally covered up long wait times, Helman responded, ""It's never come from me."" Related: Veterans languish and die on VA hospital's secret wait list . The VA's Office of Inspector General confirmed in August 3,500 veterans had been waiting for appointments on secret lists at the Phoenix VA. At a congressional hearing in September, the VA inspector general Richard Griffin said long wait times at the Phoenix VA, some of which were hidden from VA headquarters, contributed to patient deaths. With the announcement of Helman's termination, VA Secretary Robert McDonald said in a statement ""lack of oversight and misconduct by VA leaders runs counter to our mission of serving Veterans, and VA will not tolerate it."" Since President Barack Obama in August signed into law an act making it easier for the VA to fire top officials, three senior officials from Pittsburgh, central Alabama and Phoenix have now been fired. Timeline: The VA's troubled history . Two other officials were ""proposed"" for termination but then retired with their pensions intact. The VA says it has ""proposed disciplinary action"" against 45 employees nationwide for issues related to data manipulation or patient care. Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs Jeff Miller previously criticized the VA for stalling the firing of Sharon Helman, noting that she continued to be paid after she was placed on leave in May. On Monday, Miller called on the VA to fire additional officials. ""Sharon Helman's removal is a positive step, but there are still many more VA scandal figures who also must be purged from the department's payroll in order for veterans and families to receive the closure they deserve,"" Miller said.

"(CNN) -- For the second time in two years, the U.S. Navy is parting with one of its aircraft carriers for a penny. The Navy announced Thursday it's paying ESCO Marine of Brownsville, Texas, one cent to take the former USS Saratoga off its hands for dismantling and recycling. The warship was decommissioned in 1994. It is now at Naval Station Newport in Rhode Island and is expected to be towed to Texas in the summer, the Navy said. The 56,000-ton Saratoga was commissioned in 1956 and saw action off North Vietnam in 1972 and 1973. In 1985, fighters from the Saratoga helped capture terrorists who hijacked the cruise ship Achille Lauro in the Mediterranean, forcing a jetliner carrying them to land at an air base in Sicily. The carrier was also part of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and air operations over the Balkans in 1992, 1993 and 1994, according to Navy records. The Saratoga will follow the former USS Forrestal to dismantling in Texas. That ship was towed to All Star Metals of Brownsville earlier this year, with the Navy paying a penny to the ship recycler under a contract awarded last October. The recyclers make money from selling the metal they salvage from the warships. A third carrier, the former USS Constellation, is expected to meet a similar fate soon, according to a Navy statement.","The former USS Saratoga is to be recycled in Texas .

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton would topple Gov. Chris Christie in New Jersey, and Garden State voters don't think America wants a ""Jersey Guy"" president, according to a new poll released Thursday. The Quinnipiac University Poll indicates that the former secretary of state would carry New Jersey, 50%-39%, over the state's two-term, incumbent governor if the election were held today. While Christie won convincingly in his re-election bid as a Republican governor last year, the odds are still stacked against him electorally. The state has a plurality of Democratic voters, and it hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. Poll: Hillary Clinton ahead in 5 would-be GOP match-ups . In fact, the same Quinnipiac survey shows Clinton has been ahead of Christie in hypothetical match-ups since February 2013. Still, a majority of New Jersey voters (53%) says Christie would not make a good president, slightly down from April, when 57% felt the same way. Interestingly, nearly half (49%) say American voters aren't ready for a ""Jersey Guy"" president like Christie. ""Shades of Woodrow Wilson. The last Jersey guy who got elected president did not carry the state in his 1916 reelection,"" Maurice Carroll, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a news release. ""And this poll shows we haven't changed in the last century."" Christie: U.S. 'missing an enormous opportunity' on Keystone . If he does make a White House bid, a decision he's said he'll make ""well into 2015,"" more than six in 10 New Jersey voters think he should resign his governorship, something his aides have said he won't do. Christie had sky-high approval ratings following the devastation from Superstorm Sandy in 2012, but his numbers have been slipping since the George Washington Bridge scandal unfolded earlier this year and as the state's economic struggles have garnered more attention. He also saw criticism in New Jersey for his frequent travels out of state this year as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, a job that took him around the country campaigning for 2014 Republican candidates. For the poll, Quinnipiac surveyed 1,340 registered voters in New Jersey over the phone from Dec. 3-8. The sampling error is plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.","A new poll shows Hillary Clinton would defeat Chris Christie in New Jersey .

"(CNN)  -- Movie director John Landis is suing Michael Jackson, accusing the reclusive entertainer of fraud in his handling of profits from the iconic ""Thriller"" video the two made together more than 25 years ago. ""King of Pop"" Michael Jackson, seen in 2005, made the ""Thriller"" video with John Landis more than 25 years ago. Landis claimed his 1983 contract with Jackson gave him 50 percent of net profits from the 14-minute video and the documentary about the making of it, both works that he directed and co-wrote with Jackson, court documents say. Jackson ""wrongfully refused to pay or account for such profits,"" the suit, filed against the singer and Optimum Productions, says. The suit characterizes Optimum as ""a defunct corporation"" Jackson has used as an alter ego. The suit accuses Jackson of ""concealing the extent of net profits"" by not giving an annual accounting for at least the past four years, and maintains that Jackson is ""guilty of fraudulent, malicious and oppressive conduct."" Jackson's lawyers have not responded to the suit, which was filed on January 21. The video was based on Jackson's 1982 album by the same name, one of the top-selling of all time. Landis, best known as director of ""Animal House"" and ""An American Werewolf in London,"" made the song into a short horror movie, complete with Vincent Price adding narration. Word of the suit comes just after an announcement that Jackson has signed a deal to take the dancing zombie story to the Broadway stage. The Nederlander Organization, a Broadway production company, announced Tuesday that it had signed a contract with Jackson to produce ""Thriller"" on stage. The show, which Jackson is to be involved with, also is to include music from other Jackson albums, the company said. The court has set May 11 as the date for lawyers to hold a conference with a judge concerning the lawsuit.","Director John Landis, Michael Jackson made ""Thriller"" video 25 years ago .

"Editor's Note: Sunny Hostin is a legal analyst for CNN and is also a managing director of business intelligence and investigations at Kroll Inc. Previously, Hostin served as an assistant U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., where she received a Special Achievement Award for her work as a child sex crimes prosecutor. She also served as a trial attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division. Sunny Hostin says prostitution is not a victimless crime and johns should be charged. (CNN) -- We finally heard from Ashley Dupre -- or ""Kristin"" as former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer knew her. But did we really hear much? I didn't. I wanted to know more about Eliot Spitzer, the man. I wanted to know how the former Sheriff of Wall Street became the Sheriff of Nottingham -- a do-gooder gone bad. A john. ""Client No. 9."" I wanted to know how he got such a sweetheart deal. How did a ruthless prosecutor get the type of mercy from the government that he rarely, if ever, was willing to give to those he went after? But when Diane Sawyer during her ""20/20"" interview got even close to that topic, Dupre replied, ""legally I've been advised not to discuss that."" And that makes sense, since she doesn't have an iron-clad immunity deal. If she has nothing in writing, she has to be careful. But what was striking about what I did hear was that Ashley Dupre is no different than the many prostitutes I had met during my time as a prosecutor. Her story, as told to Sawyer and People magazine: Her father left when she was 3; her mother remarried; her older brother, who she described as her best friend, ran away from home when she was 12; she then ran away when she was 17. She became a high school dropout. A life of drugs, alcohol and heavy partying followed. She was raped. Visions of music stardom danced in her head. Music groupie led to high paid ""escort"". But let's call it what it is simply.... prostitution.  Watch Hostin on why Spitzer shouldn't have gotten a pass » . But Spitzer doesn't have to be careful, because he got a pass. A complete pass. He even got to keep his law license, the same one he used relentlessly and mercilessly when he went after wrongdoers. So the question I have is why? Why did the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the very same office that zealously went after Martha Stewart for lying to some of its prosecutors, give him a complete pass, a proverbial get-out-of-jail free card? U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia explained there was no evidence that campaign or public funds were used. Of course there wasn't evidence of that, Mr. Garcia -- Spitzer is rich. The U.S. Attorney also claimed that his office had also determined there was ""insufficient evidence to bring charges against Mr. Spitzer for any offense relating to the withdrawal of funds for, and his payments to, the Emperors Club VIP...."" Really? Since it seems to me (and many other lawyers I have spoken with) that there was evidence that Spitzer violated the Mann Act, which makes it a federal criminal offense to knowingly transport any individual, male or female, across state lines for the purpose of prostitution or sexual activity. The indictment made it clear that Client No. 9 met Kristin, who was based in New York but traveled to Washington, at the Mayflower Hotel, Room 871 to be exact, ""for her tryst."" It was also alleged that Client No. 9 paid for Kristin's train tickets, cab fare, mini-bar and room service, travel time and hotel. In the way Spitzer paid for her services, it appears that there was also evidence of ""structuring,"" a crime which involves creating a series of financial movements designed to obscure the true purpose of the payments. Prosecutors reportedly had a series of e-mails and wiretapped phone conversations of Spitzer, in addition to financial records. Sounds like good evidence of criminal activity to me. But Garcia finally admitted what was behind his office's decision not to prosecute Spitzer when he said ""[i]n light of the policy of the Department of Justice with respect to prostitution offenses and the longstanding practice of this office, as well as Mr. Spitzer's acceptance of responsibility for his conduct, we have concluded that the public interest would not be further advanced by filing criminal charges in this matter."" The policy he referred to is that prosecutors don't go after ""johns"" or ""customers"". But why not? What better way to cripple a business than to cut out its customers? Just look at the state of our economy -- when people aren't buying, businesses are in trouble. Pure and simple. Prostitution is not a victimless crime. Look at Ashley, really look at her. She really looks like every other prostitute -- a victim of her upbringing, a victim of her circumstance and now a victim of the government's policy. So there you have it. You can't lie to a federal prosecutor, but if you wire your own money to the accounts of an international prostitution ring, and arrange to have paid sex in the nation's capital, it's all good. You see, Martha. You should have paid for sex in Washington.

"(CNN) -- The annual Thanksgiving debate over your mother's turkey-roasting method and your uncle's political sideswiping is just about over. Even that storm that snarled up travel on the East Coast during the busiest travel time of the year has passed. It's nearly time to go home. More than 46 million people are estimated to be traveling this Thanksgiving, according to AAA projections, and 90% of them are traveling by car. With a little luck, some patience and planning, they'll make it home this weekend. #ATL24: The invisible army behind the world's busiest airport . Here are several ways to stay sane this busy holiday season: . Check your flight, no matter where you're going. Think you don't have to worry about bad weather because you're returning home to a sunny spot like Florida or California? Not so fast. That airplane you're picking up in San Diego may have been coming from Minneapolis or Chicago. If your aircraft is coming from a city hit by foul weather, it can hold up your warm weather travel. Check your aircraft's journey on your airline website, or pick an app to track your aircraft's path. Don't drive into a storm. Monitor your local and regional forecasts. If you're driving home to Buffalo and that city is expecting another seven feet of snow (hypothetically speaking), stay put. If there's a possibility that bad weather could hit while you're on the road, make sure to have cold-weather clothing and shoes, extra water and snacks, charged-up devices, diapers for the little ones, a full tank of gas and flares in case you get stopped by weather. Charge your devices. Expect crowds surrounding the electrical outlets at your departure airport to increase if your flight is delayed. And don't expect rest stops to share their outlets with you. Have a car charger and stash a power pack or a few battery chargers for your portable electronic devices (useful for driving or flying). Rebook your flight for free. Many airlines have teams devoted to tracking the weather and rearranging flight schedules to avoid bad weather. If the weather proves too dangerous for flight, airlines will often offer customers the opportunity to rebook their flights free of charge, before you leave for the airport. Sometimes, the airlines will even waive fees to rebook customers who see the writing on the wall and call before the bad weather hits. Track winter weather . Act quickly. Rebook your itinerary as soon as possible. While you mull over a new itinerary, other passengers are snapping up open seats. Be sure your airline has your e-mail address and phone number, advises Rick Seaney, CEO of airfare tracker FareCompare.com. If you didn't provide this information when you purchased the ticket, go online and add it. Elite fliers should use their loyalty program hot lines and head to frequent flier lounges for better access to airline reps. Buy a one-day lounge pass for the better service if you're not a member. Follow your airline and airport on social media. Follow your airlines and airports via Twitter and Facebook. Many airlines and airports post the speediest updates to their Twitter feeds, so start following them now. Sign up for your airline alerts to get flight updates e-mailed to your smartphone. Don't debate flight attendants about smartphones vs. computers. Your aircraft will probably be packed, and flight attendants will be busy helping infrequent travelers get settled into their seats. Yes, you now have the right to use your iPad and other portable electronic devices in airplane mode below 10,000 feet on some flights. But maybe your tablet looks big enough to look like a laptop? You may be on vacation, but your flight crew is working the holiday. Do you want to argue with people who can throw you off your flight? Be one of the nice ones. Stock up on snacks. Stock up on nonperishable snacks and drinks for the car (if you're flying, avoid the drinks, but carry an empty water bottle to refill after you clear airport security). Granola bars, beef jerky, nuts and dried fruit, and other protein-rich snacks can keep you and the children going without spending a fortune at rest stops or the airport. If you get stuck at the airport. If you get stranded, multitask. Don't only go to the ticket counter. Use the NextFlight app and type in your city pair to get the next flights for the major airlines, travel blogger Benet Wilson suggested. Then, call the airline on your cell phone and give them your preferred options. You might get booked on another flight before you reach the front of the line. (Also consider nearby cities where you can rent a car and drive to your final destination.) Stay home next year. Really, you gave the extended family Thanksgiving this year. Maybe work will ""require"" that you work the rest of that holiday week next year, and you just won't be able to make it. Just don't post pictures from sunny Barbados.","A big storm is threatening the East Coast during this busy holiday week .

Single hipsters and others without (and sometimes with) kids complain about being asked to watch their language, to not smoke outdoors near strollers and to keep their drunk friends under control so as not to scare the little ones. They don't want to feel pressure to play peekaboo. They want to cry over their beers, they say, without having an infant drown them out. If anyone is spitting up, they want it to be them. ""I will get up on the subway for kids. I will be tolerant of them kicking the back of my seat while seeing a G-rated movie. But let me have my bars,"" said Julieanne Smolinski, 26, who feels guilty sucking down suds in front of staring 5-year-olds. The adults who bring their offspring to bars, she suggests, are ""clinging to their youth."" Parents, on the other hand, say that as long as they're responsible and their kids behave, they deserve the right to grab a quick drink with friends. And, they might add, in a place like New York -- where the cost of baby sitters can be prohibitive and tight living quarters can make hosting guests at home difficult -- they need places to hang out, too. ""As a stay-at-home dad, it can be kind of isolating. Bars, as much as they're places to drink, they're places to socialize and meet people,"" said Gross, 35, a freelance writer, an editor for the blog DadWagon and the columnist behind the Frugal Traveler in The New York Times. ""I long for adult contact. ... I don't want to be excluded from the adult world."" But the divide remains wide in the blogosphere. Around 150 readers weighed in recently when someone posted on the Brooklynian, a neighborhood blog, the simple query: ""Which bars are child free?"" One writer shared the tale of a drunk father standing at a bar while his beer sloshed on his stroller-strapped kid's face. Another poster announced a bar crawl in which ""no crawlers"" would be allowed. The public debate about babies in bars ignited about two years ago when the bar Union Hall, a popular stomping ground, banned strollers from the premises, Gross said. ""At a certain point, owners said, 'Hey, enough,' "" he explained. ""Strollers take up a lot of room, especially the nice strollers. Your average Bugaboo is a beast."" This ban on buggies in a neighborhood where ""kids rule"" caused an ""uproar,"" said Erica Reitman, the 36-year-old married -- but not a ""breeder,"" she insists -- marketing director who is behind the blog F****ed in Park Slope. ""There wasn't a march on the street, but there could have been. [Union Hall] relented under pressure and got rid of the policy."" The owner of Union Hall would not talk to CNN, but an unnamed bartender -- who mentioned the bar had been issued tickets by the fire department at one point because strollers blocked exits -- confirmed that there is no such policy in place. In a part of the city where Greg Curley says he sees ""a sense of entitlement on both sides,"" and where people don't hold back their opinions -- ""This is Brooklyn,"" he said -- he and his partners at The Double Windsor instituted a no-kids-after-5 p.m. rule. ""We're a neighborhood gathering place, not a hard-drinking bar, and we're not jerks about it"" said Curley, a co-owner and the general manager. ""But the overwhelming clientele that spends quite a lot of money here can't deal with babies."" Rules like this, simple compromises, don't bother Gross as they might other parents. He's not interested in taking Sasha out till all hours of the night anyway. But when he gets a little stir-crazy in their apartment, he likes to head out to grab a stout with his little girl. He's not taking her to punk dive bars where the music is loud, fights break out and patrons make out or pass out. They gravitate to mellow hangouts, and only in the late afternoon or early evening. ""I'm not going to keep her out past 7 p.m. When the bar starts filling up, that's when we head home,"" he said. ""It's responsible parenting and responsible adult behavior. I'm not knocking back double vodkas while my daughter is stumbling around.""","Babies in bars are the subject of heated discussion in Brooklyn, where strollers rule .

"(CNN) -- Not everyone gets a second chance. Billy Smith and Christopher Scott know that all too well. They appreciate it all the more because they have been given such a chance. Smith and Scott are among the men whose stories are featured in the new book ""Tested: How Twelve Wrongly Imprisoned Men Held Onto Hope,"" which is due for release October 12. The subjects served anywhere from 18 months to 26 years behind bars for crimes they did not commit. Ultimately they were freed -- many of them thanks to DNA evidence. The book is the team effort of a mother and daughter, Dorothy and Peyton Budd. Dorothy Budd is a former child sex crimes prosecutor for the Dallas County District Attorney's Office in Texas. But it was ultimately her role as a deacon in an Episcopal church that led her to this project, she said. ""The role of a deacon is to give voice to the needs of the poor and the oppressed,"" said Budd. ""Prisoners -- people whose voices might otherwise not be heard. When I heard a woman at a Bible study talking about how she thought these men in Dallas who had been exonerated were a powerful voice for justice in the world, I wanted to meet them."" Although Budd had no writing background, her daughter Peyton Budd did, having been selected for the University of Virginia's Young Writers Workshop. With her help, they began interviewing the 12 men who would go on to be featured in ""Tested."" Although these men all shared something in common, it turned out each had his own way of coping. ""For some of them it was the unconditional love of a family member or girlfriend,"" said Peyton Budd. ""For some it was the power of music or faith in God."" It took Billy Smith time to get to that point, though. Smith was arrested in 1986 at age 35 and charged with aggravated sexual assault. The girlfriend of the building manager of Smith's Dallas, Texas-area apartment had accused Smith of robbing and raping her. A search of Smith's belongings revealed no clothing matching the description given by the victim. There was no physical evidence tying him to the crime. Both Smith and his sister testified he was home when it occurred. Still, the eyewitness identification led him to be convicted and sentenced to life in prison. ""There was a time when I fell into deep depression and despair,"" says Smith, 58, about his nearly 20 years behind bars. ""I became so despondent I considered suicide, even though I know I didn't do the crime."" Throughout much of his term, Smith admits to giving way to anger and bitterness. However, he eventually came to an important realization. ""I was tired of being angry, and I knew if I stayed angry I would have nothing to look forward to or hold onto,"" said Smith. If you hold on to anger, you can't see what's up ahead."" Before Smith actually achieved his freedom, he found spiritual peace through faith. Smith entered prison a practicing Christian, but converted to Islam while serving time. ""I found the discipline that I was looking for,"" Smith said. Through having discipline I was able to find serenity."" Smith was eventually given access to DNA testing proving he did not rape the victim. He was released in July 2006 and officially exonerated December 13 of that year. Unlike Smith, Christopher Scott did not have the benefit of science in maintaining his freedom, and DNA evidence played no role in his name being cleared. He was convicted of capital murder in 1997 and sentenced to life in prison. Scott spent the next 12 years of his life behind bars before being exonerated in 2009 after another man confessed to the crime. Scott insists that like Smith, he refuses to give in to anger when looking back on his experience. ""In the growing process, we can't be angry about it,"" said Scott, 39. ""We have to keep on moving. I was the one out of a million chance that came through. I kept my sanity and fought hard for my freedom. Now I'm free, doing things I thought I'd never do."" ""Tested"" also addresses what life after incarceration has been like for these 12 men. Some emerged from behind prison walls to find themselves like Rip Van Winkle -- in a world they did not recognize. ""I didn't know anything about cell phones,"" said Smith. ""When I saw people talking on them with headsets I thought they were talking to themselves."" Smith admits he was traumatized when he got of prison and had to learn how to live life as a free man once more. While happy about his freedom, he was scared and confused as well. Dallas had changed a great deal in nearly 20 years, and most of his friends were either dead, in prison or had moved away. Once again, he pondered suicide. Normal, mundane situations for most people became a challenge for Smith. ""I would ride the bus, and I would be afraid to have a woman accidentally brush up against me, because I know how easy it is to be caught up in a lie,"" Smith said. While faith had saved Smith while in prison, love saved him in freedom. ""I've got a good life now,"" said Smith. ""I met a woman and married her. I'm starting to come alive, and I'm having the kind of life I think was meant for me all along."" Dorothy Budd says her book isn't meant to be an indictment of the U.S. justice system. To the contrary, she calls it a ""great"" system. However, she adds ""Tested"" sends a message that mistakes can be made, even in a great system. ""It's easy to say all criminals say they are innocent so they all must be lying,"" Dorothy Budd said. ""These 12 men prove there are people in prison who really are innocent. It begs us as a society to take responsibility for that and look again."" It's a thought echoed by Smith. ""If someone is in prison and they say they are innocent...believe them,"" Smith said. ""Give them the benefit of the doubt. Hear what they have to say and work with the evidence that they have, because someone is telling the truth."" Scott said he believes the path to vindication lies in more than just outside help. ""Life is full of doubters, but you have to make those doubters believe you were innocent,"" Scott said. ""Doing that is just being yourself and fighting for what you believe in"""" While ""Tested"" is designed to highlight the stories of the exonerated men, Peyton Budd insists its message is something all readers can take to heart and learn from. ""It can help anyone through dark times in their lives, Peyton Budd says. ""Their stories give you tools on how to deal with issues of despair and really get to a place of hope and forgiveness.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Oscar given Orson Welles for ""Citizen Kane"" some 70 years ago sold for $861,542 in an online auction that ended Tuesday, a Los Angeles auction house said. The best screenplay award for 1941 was the only Academy Award for the legendary writer, director, actor, although he was given an honorary award ""for superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures"" nearly 30 years later. Nate D. Sanders Auctions did not identify the winning bidder, but the company did reveal that illusionist David Copperfield was an unsuccessful bidder. ""Orson Welles was not only a magician of the cinema, but also a performing magician himself,"" Copperfield said, according to a news release from the auction house. Welles was 25 when he wrote, directed and starred in ""Citizen Kane,"" which the American Film Institute picked in 2007 as the top film of the previous century. The golden statuette's controversial history includes a court fight with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which tried to stop another auction in 2003. An academy official testified then that the award's value was at least $1 million. A judge cleared the way for auction with a ruling in 2004 that Welles never signed the academy's agreement not to sell the trophy, according to Nate D. Sanders Auctions spokesman Sam Heller. The academy, which aggressively challenges efforts to sell Oscar trophies, was successful three years ago in stopping the sale of two Oscars awarded to silent film star Mary Pickford. A Los Angeles jury ruled the descendants of a woman who was married to Pickford's third husband could only sell the statuettes back to the academy for a price of $10. Heller would not identify the seller, although it was known to be in the hands of Beatrice Welles, the actor's youngest daughter, after she recovered it from a planned auction in 1993. It had been ""assumed to be lost"" for decades but was apparently in the hands of a cinematographer who got it from Welles, Heller said. An attempt to sell it at auction in 2007 failed to draw a buyer, Heller said. It was included in a lot of historical manuscripts, not movie memorabilia, he said. ""Citizen Kane,"" Welles' first feature film, was nominated for nine Oscars but won just for best screenplay, which Welles shared with co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz. Welles, who portrayed a fictional media tycoon, lost to Gary Cooper in ""Sergeant York"" for the best actor award. John Ford's direction of ""How Green Was My Valley"" beat Welles for best director.","The ""Citizen Kane"" best screenplay Oscar is the only Academy Award for Welles .

"(CNN) -- Theology is unnecessary. So says Stephen Hawking, the world-famous physicist who controversially argues in a new book that God did not create the universe. ""God may exist, but science can explain the universe without the need for a creator,"" Hawking told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" in an interview that aired Friday. Hawking, 68, says in his book ""The Grand Design"" that, given the existence of gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. ""Spontaneous creation,"" he writes, is the reason why the universe and humanity exist. ""Gravity and quantum theory cause universes to be created spontaneously out of nothing,"" Hawking told Larry King. King asked Hawking why he thinks people have reacted so strongly to his book. ""Science is increasingly answering questions that used to be the province of religion,"" Hawking replied. ""The scientific account is complete. Theology is unnecessary."" Hawking said his book is an attempt to give a ""broad picture of how the universe operates and our place in it. It is a basic human desire and it also puts our worries in perspective."" The idea behind it is ""M-theory,"" which, he says, allows there to be many universes that were created out of nothing, none of which required the intervention of God. That's because if there are many universes, one will have laws of physics like ours -- and in such a universe, something not only can, but must, arise from nothing, Hawking says. Therefore, he concludes, there's no need for God to have played a part. That's the point of his book, Hawking told King -- ""that science can explain the universe, and that we don't need God to explain why there is something rather than nothing, or why the laws of nature are what they are."" Hawking said that if he could travel through time -- which he said is theoretically possible -- he would go to the future to ""find if M-theory is indeed a theory of everything."" Hawking has ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which has confined him to a wheelchair and leaves him unable to speak without the help of a computerized voice synthesizer. The disease is also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease in the United States and motor neuron disease, or MND, in Britain. He told King he's doing ""pretty well"" with the disease, 45 years after he was first diagnosed. The disease has a life expectancy of two to five years, according to the ALS Association.","Hawking talks to CNN's ""Larry King Live"" about his new book .

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- The European Union's Internal Markets Commissioner says a planned ""Robin Hood"" tax on financial trades is ""only right,"" and he would like to see it enforced worldwide. Michel Barnier told CNN's Richard Quest at the World Economic Forum in Davos that capitalism had ""become a caricature of itself,"" and it was ""politically and morally"" right that the financial sector should be taxed. ""The financial crisis ... broke the back of growth and after all we helped out the financial sector, it's perfectly right and fair that it should give something back,"" he said. The controversial tax on trading in stocks, bonds and derivatives came a step closer on Tuesday when European Union finance ministers allowed some member states to proceed with the plan, intended to reap billions of euros for struggling European nations. Barnier said the tax was ""perfectly bearable,"" and could be ""applied fairly easily in technical terms."" Barnier acknowledged the fact the tax would be limited to Europe was a weakness. ""I would prefer it of course if this tax were a worldwide tax,"" he said. ""I would prefer it if the UK and even the U.S. were on board."" He said he wanted to see the rules applying to the financial sector more stringently applied to bring about ""a more moral attitude"" in the industry. ""What I challenge is all the sorts of manipulations and toxic products and excessive bonuses that can hardly be justified that we've come upon over the past few years,"" he said. ""We've seen ... the capitalist system go off the rails... We've got to bring it back on track and ensure that financial services... for the economy and for our regions.""","European Commissioner Michel Barnier has endorsed a planned ""Robin Hood"" tax .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Barack Obama sometimes gets ribbed for his outsized ideas, like the massive stage built in Denver, Colorado, to accept the Democratic presidential nomination. But an artist in Barcelona, Spain, may be about to outdo the candidate himself. Large-format sketches have long been a focus of artist Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada's work. The artist plans to create a gigantic face of Obama sculpted from gravel and sand, which will cover nearly 2.5 acres (1 hectare) of Barcelona beachfront before the U.S. elections. ""The size of the piece is intrinsic to its value,"" the artist, Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada, said Saturday. He hopes it will be big enough to be seen on Google Earth. ""Obama's personality -- his youth, personal history and message of a new politics -- has fused with the historical moment to create someone larger than life,"" says the artist's dossier about the work, titled ""Expectation."" The huge size also alludes ""to the global impact of this election,"" the dossier adds. iReport.com: What do you want to ask Sen. Obama? Rodriguez-Gerada, 42, is a Cuban-born American who grew up in North Plainfield, New Jersey, near New York, and now lives in Barcelona. The artist, who has long focused on large-format sketches and other designs, said he had been planning to put an anonymous face on Barcelona's Mediterranean beachfront but shelved the idea. Then, six weeks ago, he decided it should be Obama's face. ""Everybody's doing work about Obama,"" he said. ""I was talking to my wife about the importance of this election internationally. It all came together."" The idea, that is. The execution of the project is still a work in progress, but with a lot of help pouring in. The artist has created what he calls a ""vectored image"" from different photos of Obama, showing the candidate's face looking left over his shoulder. He will use 500 tons of material -- mainly gravel but also sand and possibly some soil in black, brown and white tones -- to create the image on a flat piece of land slightly raised and overlooking the Mediterranean, near downtown Barcelona. The artist and a Barcelona newspaper say the city has temporarily ceded use of the land for the project. The portrait of Obama's face will be 445 feet long by 264 feet wide (139.28 by 82.67 meters) and the artist hopes to have it done by late next week or no later than November 3, the day before the U.S. elections. The materials have been donated, along with bulldozers and their drivers. The crews will initially spread the materials along white lines, and other markers that will be laid out according to the sketch. Then, the artist's technical team will direct volunteers with garden rakes to put the final touches on the materials, making sure the various colors are spread properly on the ground in order to depict Obama's eyes, hair, cheeks and collar, according to the plans. Rodriguez-Gerada said he'll need to raise about $18,700 (15,000 euros) for other costs, such as rakes and gloves for volunteers, documentation, even portable toilets for the crew. He said it's his ""biggest work ever, in scale and complexity."" He's a self-described political independent until recently, when he joined Democrats Abroad in Spain. But he added that the art project is his alone, without help from any political organization or campaign, and he won't be paid for it. Rodriguez-Gerada said this project also aims to address the issue of ""trying to find heroes with empathy for the problems of the world. We really need empathy from Barack Obama. There's a need to do positive things for the future."" Obama's giant face would be environmentally friendly, with all natural colors, so the materials could be recycled, the artist said. Rodriguez-Gerada's not sure how long the face would remain in place in Barcelona, because the site is slated to be used for a new municipal building. But even if the face isn't permanent, it might be the start of outsized artistic images of Obama. Barcelona journalist Matt Elmore contributed to this report.","Cuban-American artist plans to finish work before U.S. elections .

"London (CNN) -- For visitors and newcomers, the mention of London conjures up images of the queen, gray skies, Big Ben and Parliament. But the opening of the Games of the 30th Olympiad will confront millions around the world with unfamiliar scenes of London's East End, the vibrant and distinctly proletarian heart of the capital. East London has long housed the capital's working, criminal and creative classes. And Stratford, where the Olympic Park now stands, has been regarded by many as little more than a post-industrial wasteland, a relic of the city's bygone manufacturing era. When I moved to London from Arizona in 2006, I thought the East End might look like the gilded west London settings I'd seen during my first trip to the capital in 2001. But Mile End, where I settled, one train stop from Stratford, was no one's destination of choice. Nor was Stratford -- unless, that is, you needed to buy flimsy housewares from the Poundland discount store in the grim outlet mall flanking the train station. Read more: Olympic park sets gold standard for sustainability . This may sound obvious, but one of the first things I realized when I moved to London is how old everything is when compared to Phoenix, where I was born and raised. For those who haven't been, Phoenix is a sprawling expanse of scalding hot desert and cactus-lined asphalt in southwest Arizona. Almost nothing has been around for more than a hundred years. London, on the other hand, has been lived in for thousands of years. An East End bell foundry made the Liberty Bell, that famous icon of American independence, in the 1750s, before the U.S. even became a country. Read more: Is the Olympics worth more than Google? The areas surrounding Queen Mary University in Mile End were miles from the well-kempt tourist attractions of central London. While many west London neighborhoods have aged gracefully, large eastern swathes of the capital merely look dilapidated and rundown. Fortunately, what the area lacked in towering monuments to British glory, it made up for in gruesome historical footnotes. Forget Big Ben, the London Eye and St. Paul's Cathedral. East London's top tourist attraction is the Jack the Ripper tour -- a guide around the dark streets and alleys in Whitechapel where an unidentified madman stalked, murdered and disemboweled prostitutes in 1888. Not quite the same as a double-decker bus tour past Parliament. Read more: London's World Heritage Sites . For someone who spent years piloting a car down Phoenix's broad, unclogged desert boulevards, taking a bus through the traffic-choked East End was a more adventurous prospect -- and I developed a theory early on that the number 25, cutting a path east from the West End, London's default nightlife center, had to be London's worst route. I once saw a drunk man get his face split open during a fistfight aboard the 25, a long, single-decker accordion-style monstrosity, the back section of which regularly turned into a smoking section for gangs and drunks and the only bus that ever made me truly miss my car. The only thing more surprising than the fight was that no one moved a muscle, or seemed to think it was unusual. Rather than call the police, the driver simply opened the doors to let the man off, leaking blood across the floor as he limped away. Read more: UK faces security questions ahead of Olympics . The 25 also passes the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel. It was outside this historic old boozer that William Booth delivered his sermon that established the Salvation Army -- and inside it that notorious Cockney gangster Ronnie Kray shot George Cornell through the forehead in 1966 in front of shocked drinkers. East London has always been rough around the edges, but that's what makes it interesting. Waves of immigrants have settled amongst the white working-class locals in the East End for generations -- Bangladeshi communities in Mile End and Whitechapel; Afro-Caribbean communities in Hackney; and Turkish, Kurdish and Orthodox Jewish communities in Dalston -- and the area's extreme diversity means that virtually anything you want is only a bus stop away. On a single morning at Roman Road market in Bow, you'll pass designer clothes, donuts the size of your head, pirate DVDs, and the stall whose chief product appears to be thermal socks (my personal favorite), before nipping into east London institution G. Kelly for the area's signature dish: handmade beef pies, served with mashed potatoes drenched in parsley sauce. Read more: Orbit Tower unveiled at Olympic Park . If you run out of money, you can walk across the street to an ATM that offers Cockney rhyming slang as an alternative to English. Depending on how flush you are, you can enter your huckleberry finn (PIN) and withdraw anything from a speckled hen (Â£10) to a nifty (Â£50). Ten minutes down the road, along the south end of Brick Lane, fabric shops sit alongside dozens of Bengali curry houses; at the north end, you can rummage through vintage clothing shops before tucking into a salt beef bagel at the world-famous Beigel Bake, a 24-hour reminder of Jewish migration to the area more than a century ago. A steady stream of educated, creative types have gentrified Shoreditch and Dalston in a generation, and the dozens of cafes, bars and nightclubs that sprouted up have turned the rundown road connecting the two neighborhoods into London's most fashionable destination for a night out. The smartening-up of these working-class neighborhoods -- with their cheap rent, relatively large spaces and newly opened train lines -- was inevitable in a way, but it has only added to, not dimmed, the cacophony of eclectic voices ringing through the streets. Video: Olympic spending to boost London economy . Gentrification is going on in unimaginable parts of east London today. In Hackney -- voted Britain's worst place to live by Channel 4 in 2006 -- a recently refurbished theatre and new boutique cinema flourish alongside the Vietnamese restaurants dotting Mare Street, just hundreds of feet from an area previously known as Murder Mile for a string of gangland killings which took place around 2000. But opening a series of glossy gastropubs and flower markets doesn't change the fact that three of the five official Olympic boroughs (Hackney, Newham and Tower Hamlets) are among Britain's poorest districts -- a fact which became painfully clear during last summer's riots. The shooting in August 2011 of a young black man by police in north London set off days of the worst rioting across the capital in 30 years. The epicenter of the chaos in Hackney was on Mare Street, where rioters set cars alight, battled police and took everything from shops they could carry. Read more: Four billion reasons to watch the Olympics . Today, the riots stand as a reminder that the deep-seated poverty in many parts of east London can't be wiped out by a three-week international sporting event any more than it can be eradicated by a handful of college kids moving into the neighborhood. Last summer's riots showed the worst London is capable of. But what happened the day after, when hundreds of volunteers turned up with brooms to help clean up east London's broken neighborhoods, showed an extraordinary sense of community that might have surprised some people in the capital. No one's sure yet what the Olympics will mean for the East End. Roughly Â£9.3 billion ($14.5 billion) of the public's money has been spent on the Games, three-quarters of which has reportedly been invested in long-term regeneration. But while the Olympic stadium is visible from much of east London, how many people there will actually see tangible benefits from the Games? Regardless of its future legacy, the Olympics are here now, and east London has much to be proud of. As for whether the Games can mark a turning point in the fortunes of some of Britain's poorest areas, the verdict on that won't be returned until long after the athletes have gone and the world's eyes have again turned away. Read more: London prepares for an Olympics to remember .","East London has long been home to the capital's working, creative and criminal classes .

"(CNN) -- In honor of the one-year anniversary of her groundbreaking self-titled work, Beyonce has taken us by surprise yet again. The superstar singer gets personal in a nearly 12-minute short film titled ""Yours and Mine,"" which was released Friday without warning, much in the same way she unleashed her album ""Beyonce"" in December 2013. The result is a visually arresting piece that also includes nuggets of insight from Bey, who speaks on a range of topics from feminism to fame to marriage. Here's what we learned: . 'Humanist' rather than 'feminist' One of the biggest hits from ""Beyonce"" is the track ""***Flawless,"" which uses a snippet from a 2013 TEDx talk given by writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie called ""We Should All Be Feminists."" Though Beyonce's always been a proponent of female empowerment, even going back to her Destiny's Child days, she admits in her short film that she was initially skittish around the word ""feminist."" ""I've always considered myself a feminist, although I was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it,"" Beyonce says. ""When honestly, it's very simple. It's just a person that believes in equality for men and women. Men and women balance each other out, and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other."" When it comes to men and the cultural pressures they face, ""I have a lot of empathy,"" Beyonce continues. ""I have the same empathy for women and the pressures we go through. ... I consider myself a humanist."" 'The property of the public' No one is immune to the price of fame, and that includes Beyonce. With global stardom, ""you become the property of the public,"" she laments. ""There's nothing real about it."" To be honest, ""I sometimes wish that I could just be anonymous and walk down a street like everyone else,"" she adds. ""Before I was famous, I was the girl on the hill with the guitar. I was the girl that just wanted a beautiful view of the beach. And now that I'm famous, it's really, really difficult to do very simple things. I think it's the hardest thing to give up."" CNN 10: Beyonce and more of 2014's most influential entertainers . 'Never make excuses' That said, Beyonce is never one to play the victim. ""My mother always taught me to be strong,"" she says. ""Never make excuses; never expect anyone else to provide for me things that I know I can provide for myself. I have dreams, and I feel like I have a power to actually make those dreams become a reality."" 'We're supposed to depend on each other' There are those who think they'll ""lose something when they get married, but it doesn't have to be that way,"" Beyonce, who's been married to Jay Z for six years, reflects. ""There's nothing more exciting about having a witness to your life."" And beyond that, she sees something powerful in partnership. ""You know, everybody's not good at everything. It's OK to depend on someone; it's actually what we're supposed to do,"" she says.

"(CNN) -- A whirling black and yellow mechanical beast swoops in to battle a deadly wildfire. For victims, it's like the cavalry coming to the rescue. They call it the Firehawk.Â . Los Angeles County Fire Department senior pilot Tom Short talks about this helicopter like it's a super chopper. ""Having been in all of the aircraft that are out there fighting fires, the Firehawk is the best firefighting machine I've ever seen -- simply because of what it does,"" Short told CNN on the phone this week. ""It does everything: fire, rescue and air ambulance."" Basically it's a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter outfitted with a giant water tank. This thing is engineered to get hellishly close to the heat of a raging inferno. Its dual souped-up engines can lift 9,000 pounds -- about the same weight as a large recreational travel trailer. In preparation to dump water over flames, the Firehawk's snorkel can suck 1,000 gallons of water into its storage tank in the span of one minute. ""We really work these machines very hard. During some fires, Short said, ""I've made over 100 drops in one day."" A firefighting super-chopper is especially valuable now, as California braces for what may be one of the worst wildfire seasons on record. How worrisome is it? The state's firefighting agency, Cal Fire, has responded to more than 2,500 wildfires in 2014 -- a huge increase in the average number of fires at this point in the year, the agency says. In May, several fires in San Diego County forced thousands of residents from their homes and charred more than 31 square miles. The season usually doesn't ramp up until summer or fall.","The Los Angeles County Fire Department uses three Firehawks to combat wildfires .

"(CNN) -- Pay-as-you-go products may be synonymous with mobile phones but a solar energy service in Africa is harnessing the popular business model to bring affordable electricity to the continent's remotest communities. IndiGo solar enables rural households far removed from their country's electrical grid to generate their own power via a photovoltaic panel and battery pack. Users then have the option of purchasing the energy the device produces for as little as $1 a week. The technology aims to replace environmentally harmful lighting practices such as burning kerosene oil, which contributes 190 million tons of annual CO2 emissions according to studies conducted by the Berkley Laboratory at the University of California and can cost users up to 10 times as much. ""Pay-as-you-go solar is a good system as we now have light inside,"" says Nyungura James Ode, a farmer from Mantarra Village in South Sudan and one of the first to sign up to the project. ""(We) can do more work at home and be more productive farming. Light is better (and) mothers can tend to baby at night more easily, give medicine, change clothes and diaper,"" he adds. See also: Solar lamps replacing kerosene . The system -- which can light two small rooms for seven hours at a time and charge small portable devices such as mobile phones -- has been designed and manufactured by British based solar technology company, Eight19. It works in a similar fashion to mobile phone top-up cards. When users want to purchase electricity produced by their solar pack they buy a scratch card from a local vendor. The card costs roughly $1 and reveals a code that grants access to the electricity for a week when dialed into the battery. This allows users to keep a close eye on the amount they spend and consume. ""We don't have to spend more money,"" says Ode. ""[I am] saving three to five South Sudanese Pounds a week,"" -- between $1.20 and $1.80. So far, remote towns in Kenya, Malawi, South Sudan and Zambia have adopted the IndiGo electrification scheme. Yet while the practical gains for villagers used to living without electricity are obvious, the environmental benefits have thus far been harder to gauge. The first solar packs were only introduced in September 2010, making verifying claims as to their long term green credentials difficult. See also: Amazing solar powered gadgets . But according to Steve Andrews, CEO of UK based charity, SolarAid, pay-as-you-go solar could revolutionize rural African development. ""(This) approach has the potential to bring electricity supply to these people without a traditional grid; just as mobile phones have brought telephony to those people without a need for a telephone landline system,"" says Andrews. ""Indigo is a potential game changer in bringing clean, safe lighting and electricity to the world's poorest people,"" he adds. Such enthusiastic proclamations as to the technology's environmental potential are echoed by Dr Simon Bransfield-Garth, CEO of Eight19. He says that his company hopes to make a considerable dent on global carbon emissions through IndiGo. ""We (Eight19) aim to eliminate the use of kerosene for lighting in Africa by the end of the decade,"" he explains. But in order to meet such ambitious targets, Bransfield-Garth is quick to cite the need to keep improving and developing the IndiGo product. ""At the moment we've focused on the entry product as we want to get scale but as time progresses we want to encourage people to install larger solar systems with greater capabilities,"" he says. ""So, in the future, if you pay a little extra you will be able to generate enough electricity to power items such as televisions, radios and fridges. This could mean providing access to similar levels of electricity that you get in most big cities,"" he adds.","Pay-as-you-go solar aims to bring affordable electricity to rural Africa .

"Washington (CNN) -- The House of Representatives censured veteran New York Rep. Charlie Rangel on Thursday -- a stunning downfall for a man once considered one of the most powerful members of Congress. The 333-79 vote required Rangel to stand in the well of the House as a formal censure resolution was read aloud by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California. The House ethics committee recently found the 20-term Harlem Democrat guilty on 11 counts of violating House rules, including failing to pay taxes on a vacation home in the Dominican Republic and improperly using his office to raise money for an educational center bearing his name. On November 18, the committee voted 9-1 to recommend that the House censure Rangel and that he pay restitution for any unpaid taxes. The committee's rules require that its report be presented to the House for a vote. ""It is painful to sit in judgment of our colleague"" but the punishment is appropriate, said California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the Democratic head of the ethics committee. ""While I feel for [Rangel] as a human being, I feel more strongly that a public office is a public trust,"" said Texas GOP Michael McCaul, also a member of the ethics committee. Addressing the House, Rangel admitted he had made ""serious mistakes,"" but asked for a lighter penalty than censure, which is the most serious punishment the House can impose short of expulsion. ""I brought it on myself, but I still believe that this body has to be guided by fairness,"" he said. ""Nobody has ever suffered the humiliation of a censure when the record is abundantly clear [that there is] no evidence at all of corruption."" Rangel, a former chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, insisted he never used his office for ""self-enrichment."" After being censured, Rangel ripped the decision to impose censure as a ""very, very, very political vote."" But ""at long last this two-year nightmare is over,"" he said. Several congressmen publicly backed Rangel's assertion that the censure penalty was too severe. ""Charlie Rangel is a friend and colleague. We disagree on virtually every issue,"" New York GOP Rep. Peter King said shortly before the vote. But I've never heard ""anyone question Charlie's integrity"" or seen him treat anyone with disrespect. There is no proof of activity involving ""moral turpitude"" or ""criminal intent,"" said Rep. John Tanner, D-Tennessee. Rangel, a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus, became the twenty-third House member in history to be censured. Nine others have been reprimanded. The last House members to be censured prior to Rangel were Reps. Gerry Studds, D-Massachusetts, and Daniel Crane, R-Illinois, in 1983. Both men were found guilty of sexual misconduct with House pages.","Rangel calls the censure vote ""very political""

"(CNN) -- Australia's navy Monday opened two weeks of hearings into the World War II sinking of the cruiser Sydney II, an effort to formally close the book on the country's worst naval disaster. The gun turret of Sydney II was discovered with the rest of the vessel in March 2008. The ship's entire crew of 645 died when it was sunk by the German commerce raider Kormoran. About 15 relatives of the lost men attended Monday's opening session, said Cmdr. Jack Rush, the lawyer presenting the evidence gathered by investigators to a commission of inquiry led by a retired judge. ""I don't think until today -- until you actually get to hear the evidence of the impact of a bombardment of the ship and the nature of the injuries -- I think there are some pretty mixed emotions as a consequence of it,"" Rush said. The inquiry could produce its report on the sinking by April, he said. In March, researchers discovered the Sydney's wreckage in the Indian Ocean, about 207 km (128 miles) off Australia's west coast. At the time it sank, searchers found only two floatation belts and an empty life raft -- and the only accounts of its November 1941 destruction came from survivors of the Kormoran, an armed cargo ship flying a false flag. The German ship inflicted ""enormous damage"" on the Sydney during a battle that is believed to have lasted about 35 minutes and left 70 percent of its crew dead or incapacitated, Rush said. ""It is likely that the captain, the navigator, all the senior officers were taken out on the first salvo,"" he said. A torpedo tore into the Sydney's bow, flooding the forward end of the ship, while the Kormoran fired an estimated 87 rounds from its 15-cm (5.9-inch) guns into the Australian cruiser. The Sydney limped away and sank sometime between two to four and a half hours later, Rush said. During the battle, however, the Kormoran was hit by an Australian shell that damaged its engines and set the vessel ablaze. With hundreds of mines aboard, its captain ordered the crew to abandon ship, fearing the fire would set those off. A search began only five days after the battle, when the Sydney had failed to return to port in Fremantle. And an 11-day delay by Australia's government in announcing the ship's loss fueled what a 1999 parliamentary report called ""a proliferation of theories"" about the fate of the crew -- that the ship was actually sunk by a Japanese submarine, that survivors were machine-gunned in the water or that the government hid bodies after they washed up on the beach. Rush said some of the proponents of those theories will be allowed to present their cases to the inquiry as well. ""We're not hearing from everyone, but we are giving an opportunity to people to make those arguments,"" he said.","The wreckage of Sydney II was found in March 2008 off Australia's western coast .

"(CNN) -- ""I did not really realize I was getting life until the date of sentencing. When my attorney told me, I told him that I wanted to take back my guilty plea... they denied me."" Timothy Tyler says his life ended when he was 23-years-old. That was two decades ago, when he was arrested and later sentenced to a mandatory double-life term in prison without the possibility of parole for conspiracy to possess LSD with intent to distribute. A self-described ""Deadhead,"" Tyler was busted after mailing five grams of the hallucinogenic drug to a friend who was working as an informant for the federal government. He's had more than 20 years to fixate on that moment, years of ""what ifs"" and ""whys."" More than 20 years of feeling like he died, until now. Changes on the horizon . Though the Obama administration has been campaigning for prison reform for some time, it has recently begun to take concrete steps to alleviate overcrowded federal prisons that are flooded with non-violent offenders. The Justice Department announced changes to its clemency criteria this week, a move that will likely lead to a wave of sentence commutation requests being sent to President Barack Obama by thousands of prisoners who've been convicted of non-violent drug crimes. ""We are launching this clemency initiative in order to quickly and effectively identify appropriate candidates, candidates who have a clean prison record, do not present a threat to public safety, and were sentenced under out-of-date laws that have since been changed, and are no longer seen as appropriate,"" Deputy Attorney General James Cole said at a news conference Wednesday. The clemency changes would be open to prisoners who have met a set of specific conditions: they must be low-level, non-violent offenders without a significant criminal history and must be serving a federal sentence that would likely be shorter if they were convicted today. They must have served at least 10 years of their sentence and have demonstrated good conduct in prison, with no history of violence before or during their prison term. The pending changes are the latest step in an ongoing effort Attorney General Eric Holder calls ""Smart on Crime,"" which also seeks to remedy the once-common wide disparity in sentences handed down over powder versus crack cocaine, based on guidelines first enacted by Congress more than 25 years ago. In January, Holder urged Congress to pass the bipartisan ""Smarter Sentencing Act,"" which would allow judicial leniency in the sentencing of those convicted of federal non-violent drug crimes. And in April, the U.S. Sentencing Commission voted unanimously to back a Justice Department proposal to change the sentencing formula for drug offenders that could shorten prison stays for as many as 70% of federal drug defendants. ""This reduction in the federal sentencing guidelines, while modest, sends a strong message about the need to reserve the harshest penalties for the most serious crimes,"" Holder commented. Of the more than 200,000 inmates in the federal prison system, some estimates show the new clemency criteria could apply to about 2,000 prisoners. But the number is likely to fall to perhaps hundreds after government lawyers review the applications. Sentencing guidelines . The history of federal mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses dates back to the 1950s, when a mandatory 10-year sentence could be imposed for crimes such as selling heroin to a juvenile. In the 60s, then-President Richard Nixon proposed sentencing reforms that would eventually result in nearly all mandatory minimum penalties for drug offenses being repealed. But the alarming rise of cocaine use, particularly crack cocaine, in the 1980s sent Congress scrambling to react to the epidemic and prompted the hasty revival of the laws that had been viewed so unfavorably two decades before. Though the primary goal of legislation such as The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 was to target and successfully prosecute ""kingpins"" or major drug traffickers, thousands of low-level offenders, like Tyler, have been swept up and imprisoned based on outdated guidelines. While he understands why some may have trouble sympathizing with a three-time drug offender, Tyler offers perspective. ""A life sentence, people don't really understand it. A man raped his daughter, got probation. A man killed people with his car, got probation. They don't understand. If they did 10 days in jail they would understand... they can't comprehend."" In 1991, Tyler was a fixture in the Grateful Dead fan community. His days were often spent crisscrossing the country alongside fellow ""Deadheads."" Now, his days are spent alongside convicted murderers and rapists, his nights locked down at 9:45 p.m. ""I actually thought that I would get 262 months-327 months, which is a lot of time, but it had a release date,"" he explained. Tyler was arrested on his way to a Grateful Dead concert in California and was eventually extradited back to Florida, the state in which he mailed his LSD delivery. On the day he was sentenced, he tried his best to conceal his emotions for the sake of his sister, who was present in the courtroom. But ""once I walked out of the courtroom while seeing my sister's eyes tearing up, I could not hold back my own,"" he remembered. Crack cocaine at heart of once-common sentencing disparity . Wouldn't take plea deal . Tyler was initially offered a plea bargain with a 10-year sentence in exchange for testimony against his co-defendants. Had he accepted the deal, he would have been released about 10 years ago. But the decision wasn't that easy. One of his co-defendants was his own father. Tyler maintains that his father had never ingested LSD, but like his son, was only assisting a friend in obtaining the drug. Tyler did not testify against his father, who was convicted on a lesser offense. ""My dad was just helping his friend acquire some because he knew I was able to get it,"" Tyler told CNN over the phone from Canaan Federal Prison in Pennsylvania. ""He certainly did not think he could get 10 years for a simple envelope."" Admittedly, Tyler was an avid user of LSD and was often called upon by friends to procure the illegal drug, which was often in abundance at Grateful Dead concerts. ""When I was arrested, me and my friends considered LSD to be sacred or a sacrament,"" he said. And though his two previous encounters with law enforcement for similar crimes had resulted only in probation, his third offense triggered the federal government's mandatory sentencing guidelines that would ensure he never spends another day as a free man. According to Tyler, his public defender never explained to him the federal minimum mandatory guidelines, and by the time he did learn about them, it was too late. The guidelines did not allow the judge to take into consideration Tyler's age, mental state, drug addiction, or the absence of violence when he decided his punishment. The guilty plea he thought would soften his sentence and spare his father effectively ended Tyler's chances of ever stepping outside of prison again. ""I loved my father just like I loved my adopted family at the concerts, so I could not go against him or them."" Following sentencing they sat together in prison, father and son, contemplating the bleak future that awaited them both. ""He did tell me after sentencing while we were in the same jail together that he would not live long enough to complete his sentence,"" Tyler remembers. His father's premonitions proved true when he passed away in federal prison in April of 2001, with only 18 months left to serve. Does the punishment fit the crime? Tyler's supporters -- including his most ardent advocate, his sister Carrie -- don't think his punishment fits his crime. ""I don't think I've done more wrong to society than has been done to me,"" Tyler explains. He can't help but get emotional thinking of his father. ""My dad died in prison, how much blood does society feel they need?"" Many of his supporters believe that minimum mandatory sentencing is an inhumane and inefficient way to fight the war on drugs. More than 300,000 people have signed a change.org petition calling for clemency in Tyler's case. In addition, groups such as Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the ACLU, and the Clemency Project are lobbying for his release. ""People have been becoming more aware, evolving it seems. Based on that and the current President and Attorney General Holder, maybe there is hope for others too because there are about 3,700 others who are doing life for non-violent [offenses],"" Tyler explains. And though legislation such as the ""Smarter Sentencing Act"" is a perfect example of the turning tide on the issue, Tyler says only one person can help him gain his freedom. ""The only thing I can wish for now is a commutation of sentence from the President."" Considering that Obama issued clemency in December of 2013 for eight non-violent drug offenders, and the recent changes in clemency criteria, this isn't out of the realm of possibility. While daydreaming about freedom may be a nice thought for Tyler, he's cautiously optimistic about his chances of actually being released. ""I never thought about it 'til recently. I never thought about it but I have some supporters out there and maybe I will. I know my sister is wishing that would happen."" As he waits, Tyler -- or Inmate #99672-012 -- takes it one day at a time. ""I hold out, live day to day, stay healthy, keep a positive attitude."" ""I can beat any man around in handball, which is a big thing in prison."" Rules change means more drug offenders eligible for clemency . CNN's Evan Perez contributed to this report.","Tyler is among the thousands serving life sentences for non-violent drug crimes .

"(CNN) -- Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania, a longtime fixture on the House subcommittee that oversees Pentagon spending, died after complications from  gallbladder surgery, according to his office. He was 77. The Democratic congressman recently underwent scheduled laparoscopic surgery at National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to remove his gallbladder. The procedure was ""routine minimally invasive surgery,"" but doctors ""hit his intestines,"" a source close to the late congressman told CNN. Murtha was initially hospitalized in December and had to postpone a hearing with Defense Secretary Robert Gates on the administration's strategy in Afghanistan. The congressman returned to work after a few days in the hospital and helped oversee final passage of the 2010 defense appropriations bill. The National Naval Medical Center issued a statement saying Murtha was admitted January 28 for surgery, but declined to reveal additional details, citing his family's request for privacy and federal privacy laws. In a written statement, Ray Mabus, secretary of the Navy, and Adm. Gary Roughead, chief of naval operations, expressed sympathy and condolences. Murtha had a ""tough-as-nails reputation"" and a ""passion for service,"" President Obama said in a written statement. He was ""a steadfast advocate for the people of Pennsylvania"" and ""a respected voice on issues of national security,"" Obama said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a longtime ally of Murtha's, said in a statement that he always put ""the troops and their families first."" Murtha was ""incredibly effective in his service in the House,"" said Wisconsin Rep. David Obey, chairman of the Appropriations Committee. ""Every person who serves in the military has lost an advocate and a good friend."" Murtha ""will be missed,"" said House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""The House of Representatives has lost one of its own."" Murtha had represented Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District since 1974, making him the chamber's eighth most senior member. According to his biography on the House of Representatives Web site, Murtha was the first Vietnam War combat veteran elected to Congress. He was considered one of ""the kings of pork"" on Capitol Hill by taxpayer watchdog groups for requesting tens of millions of dollars in earmarks. On his House Web site, Murtha strongly defended earmarks, saying, ""I believe that elected representatives of the people understand their constituents and districts best."" Supporters said his efforts helped bring thousands of jobs to western Pennsylvania. Other controversies dogged Murtha's career. Critics alleged that he steered Pentagon contracts to businesses that hired his brother as a lobbyist, but Murtha insisted that his brother was treated like everyone else. Murtha also turned up in the FBI's Abscam investigation in 1980 when undercover agents offered bribes to several members of Congress. Murtha was videotaped turning down a bribe, saying he wasn't interested ""at this point."" He was not charged. Murtha came under fire during the 2008 election campaign for saying that part of his state was a ""racist area"" where constituents would not vote for Obama because he was black. He later apologized and said, ""While we cannot deny that race is a factor in this election, I believe we've been able to look beyond race these past few months."" Murtha won 58 percent of the vote in 2008, his last re-election; Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain won the district by less than 1,000 votes. Murtha, a former Marine, also earned a reputation as one of Congress's loudest anti-war voices. He initially supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but he stunned much of Washington when he called for a swift U.S. pullout in November 2005, saying, ""U.S. and coalition troops have done all they can. ... It's time for a change in direction."" In 2006, Murtha seemed on track to become the House Majority leader, but he lost to Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland. Murtha said he was subject to ""swift boat-style attacks"" on his ethics record, blasting critics who raised concerns about ""unfounded allegations that occurred 26 years ago."" Born June 17, 1932, in West Virginia, Murtha moved with his family to Pennsylvania as a child. Before joining the House, he was in the Pennsylvania state Legislature. He also served 37 years in the Marines and Marine Corps Reserves. He retired from the Reserves in 1990 and received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. Murtha attended Washington and Jefferson College, but dropped out in 1952 to enlist in the Marines. He later graduated from the University of Pittsburgh. He is survived by his wife, Joyce, and three children.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's move to relax travel, trade and economic restrictions with Cuba set off a firestorm from opponents on Capitol Hill, who immediately vowed to block the new policy. Top Republican leaders and other key lawmakers were furious they were kept in the dark about the secret mission orchestrated by the White House to bring home Alan Gross, an American hostage held in Cuba for the last five years. Although they supported Gross' release they denounced the Obama administration's sweeping changes to a policy that isolated the communist country for over 50 years, arguing these steps would only make it harder to force a more democratic government in Cuba. What can Congress do to roll back Obama's actions? Defund a new U.S. Embassy in Cuba . Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, whose parents emigrated from Cuba, said he would use every tool at his disposal -- including using Congress' power of the purse to block funding for a new U.S. embassy in Havana. But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, who was part of the U.S. delegation that flew down to pick up Gross, batted aside the funding threat, noting there are already diplomatic personnel working in a U.S. ""Interests Section"" in Havana. ""The horse is out of barn,"" Leahy said. The spending bill that Obama signed on Tuesday night funds the State Department's operations through September. That measure includes funding for the U.S diplomatic facility in Cuba's capital. GOP leaders are discussing whether to strip that money out as part of their debate on spending bills early next year. Republicans will control both chambers of Congress next year and both top leaders -- House Speaker John Boehner and Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell -- made statements critical of the President's actions. In an interview on Wednesday the incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he deferred to Rubio, effectively agreeing to fight back aggressively to reverse the administration's Cuba policy. ""Sounds like the correct response to me,"" McConnell told The Associated Press about Rubio's pushback to the President's new policy. ""I think he knows more about this than almost anybody in the Senate if not everybody in the Senate and I wouldn't differ with his characterization."" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he wasn't sure the votes were there in the Senate, but he would be part of an effort to try to unravel the new rules. ""I am hopeful that we will prevent a bad deal and a bad decision,"" Cruz said on CNN. Block the nomination of the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba . Obama instructed Secretary of State John Kerry to ""to re-establish diplomatic relations that have been severed since January of 1961."" But Rubio, who is expected to chair a key Senate panel that would consider a presidential pick for U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, immediately vowed to block any nomination. Democrats again point to existing diplomatic personnel in place to keep an embassy running in Havana. RELATED: The wait for Cuban beaches and cigars continues . ""There are lots of countries where we don't necessarily have a confirmed ambassador in place right now, but we have full diplomatic relations with them,"" Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said. Retain current U.S. embargo . The President outlined a series of changes such as new travel rules, allowing American tourists to use debit cards while visiting Cuba, permitting relatives to send money to family members living in Cuba. But he admitted the current embargo passed by Congress restricts the scope of what he could do. He called on Congress to lift the embargo -- something Rubio and other top Republicans said wouldn't happen in the next Congress. While he was confident Congress wouldn't repeal the embargo, Rubio acknowledged there are limitations to what Congress can do to stop the President's plans from moving forward. ""Many of the changes that have been today such as diplomatic relations fall within the purview of the presidency. My criticisms are largely based on the fact that these are unwise decisions,"" Rubio said. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this story .","Congressional Republicans are upset with the Obama administration's new policies with Cuba .

"(CNN) -- When David Kronmiller wakes up and sits down at his computer in the morning, he usually checks the Huffington Post, the Drudge Report, Politico and the polls on RealClearPolitics. But the day after the election, he realized he didn't need to check those polls. There weren't any. David Kronmiller will focus on writing and filmmaking now that he doesn't have election polls to check. ""There is some sadness to that,"" said Kronmiller, a North Hollywood, California, resident who frequently contributes his views to iReport.com. Although he supported President-elect Barack Obama since the primaries, the end of the presidential election means he won't have a race to follow anymore. ""I expect serious withdrawal, like, tonight or tomorrow,"" he said Wednesday. After two intense years of campaign ups and downs for both major U.S. political parties, the nation has finally settled on a president. Although initially, Obama's victory brings celebrations for supporters, experts say the let-down that voters of each side may feel after the campaign is akin to postpartum depression. ""There's this run-up: OK, it's nine months, and then the baby is delivered,"" said Rosalind Dorlen, a clinical psychologist in Summit, New Jersey. ""All of the waiting is over, and the focus of the attention is no longer on the pregnant woman, but there's all kinds of feelings about the loss of the pregnancy. ""Maybe we will have some people who will have post-election depression because they have been expectantly looking forward to this blessed event that they participated in,"" she said. Nancy Molitor, a clinical psychologist Wilmette, Illinois, started seeing some post-election despair even before the final results came in. Some of her patients wondered what they would do with their time in the absence of polls and campaign coverage. ""This lady is in her 80s, and she told me she's never in her life been excited about a campaign as she is about this campaign, and she knows it's filled this void in her life,"" she said. Supporters of the winning candidate may feel as if they are going through withdrawal from a drug, Molitor said. They may also develop anxiety over what will change with the new president or become cynical about anything changing at all. By contrast, someone whose favored candidate lost may go through something similar to grieving: starting with numb disbelief and then moving to anger, sadness and, eventually, recognition of the need to move on, she said. Mourning over a lost campaign resonates with Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor who worked on Al Gore's campaign in 2000. In a column for CNN.com, she recalled feeling lost and disillusioned at first, and had no idea what to do with her life. ""It hurts like hell,"" she wrote. ""It is like death of someone close to you -- the difference is no corpse or casket to help bring closure, just more election analysis and pundits spewing out what you did wrong."" She advises staff members, volunteers and supporters of candidates who lost on Tuesday to let out their grief: ""Grieve. Mourn. Let it out."" Read Donna Brazile's 'A letter to the losers' To combat the letdown of the period after the election, Molitor advises people to put routine back into their lives. Political junkies who lost their sleeping and eating routines should get back on schedule, she said. They should also take part in community activities, such as book clubs or other interest groups. Even supporters of winning and losing candidates may feel a little off for two weeks or more, she said. For some, the excitement will continue for a couple of weeks, until the reality sets in that the candidates they elected won't be able to do anything until January, said Jana N. Martin, a licensed psychologist in Long Beach, California. Anyone who feels depressed, hopeless or powerless after the election should realize that they as individuals have the ultimate control over their everyday lives, she said. ""The president is not going to find you a job; the president is not the one who manages your individual budgets,"" she said. ""If people want changes, they can do that in their day-to-day lives. They don't need a candidate to do that."" Those who feel truly overwhelmed should see a psychologist who can help them think out loud, she said. Aric Butler, a Pennsylvania State University student who supported Sen. John McCain, said he's not upset that Obama won but does feel a sense of withdrawal. ""I love discussing and debating politics, and now that the election is over it seems like nobody wants to discuss politics anymore, which is very disappointing (in) this short (time) after the election,"" he said in a recent e-mail. But for some, the end of the election season brings feelings of relief. Alex Khanye, a student at California State University in Sacramento and a McCain supporter, said Thursday that he feels better now than throughout the campaign because of the bitterness and anger that it sparked in some people. A few weeks ago, when he was at a rally, someone slashed the tires of his car, which had a McCain bumper sticker. ""We had all kind of accepted that Obama was going to win probably, for the last month for so, so it wasn't like we were really that hopeful going into the election, so we had come to grips with it, at least I had,"" he said. ""I'm ready for everything to kind of go back to normal."" Others say the end of the election simply means they'll have more time to focus on other aspects of their life. Adam Sieff, a Columbia University student who supported Obama, said he'll now have more time to concentrate on schoolwork and maintains that his ""withdrawal"" will not be of postpartum proportions. With more free time in the absence of campaign-following, Kronmiller said he's going to get focused on his own writing and filmmaking. iReport.com: 'Obama won -- now maybe we can move forward' ""As (Obama) said (Tuesday) night, it's time to get to work, and get things moving forward again, instead of all this fighting, all this resistance that we've had,"" he said.","Supporters of both winners and losers in the 2008 elections may feel let down .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday warned consumers to stop using certain Zicam nasal cold remedy products, saying they can cause users to lose their sense of smell permanently. Zicam Cold Remedy Nasal Gel and two other products are the subject of a new FDA warning to consumers. The agency says that since 1999, it has received more than 130 reports of loss of smell associated with Zicam Cold Remedy Nasal Gel; Zicam Cold Remedy Nasal Swabs; and Zicam Cold Remedy Swabs, kids size. The products have been linked to long-lasting or permanent loss of smell called anosmia. In some cases, the loss of smell occurred after the first dose. ""Loss of sense of smell is a serious risk for people who use these products for relief from cold symptoms,"" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""We are concerned that consumers may unknowingly use a product that could cause serious harm, and therefore we are advising them not to use these products for any reason.""

A number of lawsuits have already been filed against Matrixx over the products. On its Web site, however, Matrixx says the allegations are ""unfounded and misleading."" The company contends that ""there is no known causal link between the use of Zicam Cold Remedy nasal gel and impairment of smell.

"(CNN) -- To most owners of the new iPhone, the voice-activated feature called Siri is more than a virtual ""assistant"" who can help schedule appointments, find a good nearby pizza or tell you if it's going to rain. She's also a she. Siri answers questions in a part-human, part-robot voice that's deep, briskly efficient and distinctly female. (At least in the U.S. and four other countries. In France and the UK, Siri is male.) People describe the app using female pronouns. Her gender has even prompted some users to flood blogs and online forums with sexually suggestive questions for Siri such as ""What are you wearing?"" (Siri's baffled response: ""Why do people keep asking me this?"") The fuss over Siri's sex also raises a larger question: From voice-mail systems to GPS devices to Siri and beyond, why are so many computerized voices female? One answer may lie in biology. Scientific studies have shown that people generally find women's voices more pleasing than men's. ""It's much easier to find a female voice that everyone likes than a male voice that everyone likes,"" said Stanford University Professor Clifford Nass, author of ""The Man Who Lied to His Laptop: What Machines Teach Us About Human Relationships."" ""It's a well-established phenomenon that the human brain is developed to like female voices."" Research suggests this preference starts as early as the womb, Nass said. He cites a study in which fetuses were found to react to the sound of their mother's voice but not to other female voices. The fetuses showed no distinct reaction to their father's voice, however. Another answer lies in history. According to some sources, the use of female voices in navigation devices dates back to World War II, when women's voices were employed in airplane cockpits because they stood out among the male pilots. And telephone operators have traditionally been female, making people accustomed to getting assistance from a disembodied woman's voice. When automakers were first installing automated voice prompts in cars (""your door is ajar"") decades ago, their consumer research found that people overwhelmingly preferred female voices to male ones, said Tim Bajarin, a Silicon Valley analyst and president of Creative Strategies Inc. This may explain why in almost all GPS navigation systems on the market, the default voice is female. One notable exception has been Germany, where BMW was forced to recall a female-voiced navigation system on its 5 Series cars in the late 1990s after being flooded with calls from German men saying they refused to take directions from a woman. ""Cultural stereotypes run deep,"" said Nass, who details the BMW episode in his book. Voice casting . Most companies that produce automated voices hold auditions for voice actors and collect recordings of them speaking. Then they invite focus groups to listen to the recordings and rate the voices on how well they convey certain attributes: warmth, friendliness, competence and so on. ""It's casting,"" Nass said. ""It's something Hollywood has known for a long, long time."" Look no further than examples of automated or artificial-intelligence voices in sci-fi movies and TV shows. Voices of authority or menace tend to be male: the homicidal HAL 9000 computer in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" the computer program in ""WarGames,"" or Auto, the spaceship's autopilot function in ""Wall-E."" More subservient talking machines, such as the onboard computer from the ""Star Trek"" TV series, skew female. Bajarin, the Silicon Valley analyst, believes that more computerized voices would be masculine if not for the associations with HAL, whose malicious intent in the 1968 Stanley Kubrick film was made even creepier by his soothing tone. ""A lot of tech companies stayed away from the male voice because of HAL,"" he said. ""I've heard that theory tossed around multiple times."" (One prominent exception: The chipper ""You've got mail!"" voice from AOL's dial-up days.) When it comes to consumer applications of computerized voices, the sex of the voice is usually determined by what service or product is employing it. For example, transit systems such as the San Francisco Area's BART often use higher-pitched voices because they are easier to hear over the clatter of the train cars. Nuance, a Massachusetts-based company that develops speech technologies for Ford vehicles' SYNC system, Amazon e-readers and other clients, creates both male and female voices. It's then up to the client to choose which voice, and gender, best fits their product, said chief creative officer Gary Clayton. ""As these products become part of our everyday lives, there's a huge opportunity for personalization,"" added Brant Ward, the company's director of advanced speech design. ""I could have an approximation of my wife's voice read me a text message in my car."" Siri: Brilliant or sexist? Siri, the iPhone 4S's voice, grew from a five-year research project that was funded by military agency DARPA and led by SRI International, a Bay Area research institute. The project spawned a company, also called Siri, that launched an iPhone app in February 2010 and was acquired by Apple two months later. That original Siri voice-to-text app -- powered in part by Nuance's technology -- also worked by people speaking commands into their phones, although it didn't talk back. And it had no gender. In fact, the app was originally conceived to speak in a gender-neutral voice, said Norman Winarsky, vice president of SRI and a co-founder of Siri. ""What Apple did is absolutely brilliant,"" said Winarsky, who calls speech ""the most natural of all human interfaces."" ""They took Siri and gave it more of a personality,"" he said. ""It's the first real artificial intelligence working in millions of people's hands."" An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on why the company gave Siri a female voice in the U.S. Nor would she say why Siri speaks like a man in the UK, where iPhone 4S owners have swarmed online forums to request a female voice instead. ""Eww!! Hope UK gets female voice soon,"" wrote one commenter. ""I don't think anyone in the US cares about male voice option."" Many GPS devices and computer text-to-speech programs now offer multiple voice options. And someday soon, voice-technology experts say, Siri will probably speak in a variety of voices, too. Until then, some bloggers have wondered: Are computerized female ""assistants"" sexist? Not necessarily, said Rebecca Zorach, director of the Social Media Project at the University of Chicago's Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality. ""I think they have to be understood in a broader context in which they're one small piece,"" she wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""Voices intended to convey authority (such as voice-over narration in films) tend to be male. So yes, probably these compliant female robot voices reinforce gender stereotypes, not just because they serve the user but because the technology itself is about communication and relationships (areas that women are presumed to be good at). ""I wouldn't automatically claim any sexism in individual companies' choices, though. Most such decisions are probably the result of market research, so they may be reflecting gender stereotypes that already exist in the general public."" Zorach listened to some sound clips of Siri online, then e-mailed back again. ""What's interesting to me is how they seem to intentionally make her speech sound artificial -- they could choose to make her speech more seamless and human-like, but they choose instead to highlight the technology,"" she said. ""That makes you aware of how high-tech your gadget is.""","Studies have shown people generally find women's voices more pleasing than men's .

"(WIRED)  -- The end of the internet comes not with a bang or a procession of four lolcats of the apocalypse, but just with two blinking lights on a modem. At least that's how it came for Andre Vrignaud, a 39-year-old gaming consultant in Seattle, when Comcast shut him off from the internet for using too much data. Vrignaud, it seems, committed the foul of using more than 250 GB of data on Comcast two months in a row, triggering the company's overage policy that results in a year-long ban from using its services. ""It's one of those things I never thought would hit me,"" Vrignaud said. ""They didn't even call. I just got double blinking lights on my modem."" ""If I'd been foolish enough to depend on something like Skype or some other VOIP service for 911, I would have been hosed,"" Vrignaud said, arguing that internet service has become a utility much like water and electricity -- services that can't easily be turned off, due to regulations. It was the second month in a row that Vrignaud got those blinking lights. The first time he called in and tried to figure out what the problem was. So he turned off the router he had that was open to the public, and asked his roommate to go a bit lighter on data usage, since his household is heavy on streaming media, including YouTube, NetFlix and Pandora. WIRED: Shed a tear, the age of broadband caps begins . What he didn't count on, Vrignaud said, was that Comcast, who he was paying $60 a month for a 15Mbps download speed, was counting uploads against the quota as well. Just recently he'd switched his online backup system from Mozy to Carbonite, after Mozy put an end to its unlimited back-up service. Carbonite has no such limit, but does throttle users' uploads once it hits a high level. And Vrignaud, a hardcore geek who at one point worked as a Microsoft technology evangelist for XBox 360 and XBox live, has a lot of data he shares with the cloud. He's got his music ripped into lossless FLAC format, in addition to lower rates, amounting to about a gig a disc -- which he stores in a basement RAID server that can handle 12 TB of data. (He says it has plenty of empty space.) WIRED: AT&T puts broadband users on monthly allowance . As an amateur photographer, he saves his photos in RAW format, which can run to about 10MB per image. And when Amazon last week opened up its cloud music service to unlimited storage of music files in AAC, Vrignaud batch-converted his collection and began uploading it. The music is what he assumes caused the problem, but he's not sure. He admits to doing a little bittorrenting in the last month, but says it was limited to getting a few episodes of a famous British sci-fi show that's not totally available in the U.S. And all Comcast is saying is that he's kicked off -- and under the terms of the ban, he can't even switch to a uncapped, higher-priced, lower-speed business connection. Comcast told Wired.com that Vrignaud is at fault for not monitoring his bandwidth better. Spokesman Charlie Douglas says the 250 GB limit, which it imposed in October 2008 after agreeing to not throttle peer-to-peer traffic, is intended to keep users like Vrignaud from impacting their neighbors. Median data usage for its cable internet customers is 4 to 6 GBs per month, according to Douglas. WIRED: Verizon halts unlimited smartphone data plans . ""Looking at the facts, it appears that it is a straightforward story,"" Douglas said. ""There's not much we can say. We called and reiterated the policy and told him if he did exceed it again in six months, he would face suspension. That is our policy."" ""If someone's behavior is such that it degrades the quality of service for others nearby -- that's what this threshold is meant to address,"" Douglas said. ""It can negatively affect other people."" That's in part because cable internet connections work off a loop of cable shared by a collection of customers. The more data being used, the slower everyone's speed gets, unless the company spends the money to break a loop into smaller loops. (This is why cable connections can get very slow in the evening, when many people go online for entertainment.) You might think that Comcast is trying to save money on bandwidth by capping the GBs. But data usage is not very expensive for a large ISP. It's somewhere around 2 cents per GB of traffic sent to or received from the greater internet, and the prices keep dropping. WIRED: Comcast rolls out broadband meters coast and coast . Oddly though, the 250 GB cap hasn't increased at all since '08, even as Comcast has aggressively adopted better technology called DOCSIS that lets them send more and more data through the same size pipes, which the company has used to increase the speed of customers' connections, mostly without charge. The policy is ostensibly meant to help with congestion at peak times, but it makes no differentiation between data used in the evenings and that used from midnight to 8 a.m. when internet usage typically falls off. That's a model that Americans are very familiar with, thanks to mobile phone calling plans that discourage calling during weekday business hours, when minutes are counted against a preset quota, while making nights and weekends calls free. However, the simple total bandwidth model is the one that's become popular. AT&T recently slapped a 150 GB per month cap on its DSL service, while Time Warner Cable trialed services with extremely low caps, only to retreat after intense protest by customers and politicians. On the mobile front, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile all have caps on mobile data usage (with varying penalties and overcharges), leaving only Sprint without any real cap. Vrignaud, like many others, thinks Comcast's limits are really about trying to protect its core video cable business from people switching to online alternatives such as Netflix and Hulu. Vrignaud says he's weighing his other connectivity options -- which are limited to some relatively slow DSL connections and the troubled Clearwire 4G to the home servie. Verizon laid some fiber near Seattle, but Comcast's franchise agreements with the city prohibited Verizon from laying fiber in the city proper -- and Verizon has since given up on the area. So for now he's using neighbors' open access points and internet cafes to do his business, many of which are powered by Comcast. But he's vowing not giving up quietly and has already posted about the cutoff on his blog, which attracted more than 130 comments by Wednesday -- not all of them supportive. Vrignaud vows to plead his case to politicians and regulators. ""I struggle when I watch Comcast raising broadband speeds, and at same time, saying they can't afford all this internet usage, without doing deep packet inspection and other invasive things,"" Vrignaud said. ""They haven't laid new cable in 15 years. I'm pretty much a nonregulation guy, and I'd just rather let the market be competitive. But I get really frustrated in situations like this where what is truly a bad company is not being forced to improve because it doesn't have to. I really don't have any choices here."" Comcast sees it differently. ""People should be careful if they have a terabyte of data to back-up,"" Douglas said. ""They should manage their consumption carefully, and do it over time.""

"(CNN) -- The last time Mark Sanford held public office, his political career was thought to be over after he admitted to an extramarital affair. The South Carolina governor said he was looking for forgiveness when he began his bid for the congressional seat he held from 1995 to 2001. On Tuesday, it appeared that his push for political redemption was working, as he took a 13 percentage point lead in a Republican primary runoff for the seat, according to early, unofficial reports from the South Carolina State Election Commission. His opponent, Charleston City Councilman Curtis Bostic, conceded to Sanford. Whether to forgive him, the Republican told CNN in January, would be a personal decision for each voter. ""There's an amazing reservoir of human grace out there, there's a reservoir of God's grace that each of us have to access ourselves as best we can,"" he said during the interview on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight. Sanford wins GOP nomination for House seat . Some voters, Sanford said, told him they will consider his background before deciding their vote. ""Forgiveness really is in the hands of the other, and I think it's incumbent upon each of us to make that decision for ourselves,"" he said, citing his 52 years in the state and two decades in politics. Last month it appeared the political scales were once again tipping in Sanford's favor after he came in first in a 16-candidate primary. He finished with 37% of the vote, far short of the 50% needed to avoid a runoff, but he said that his first-place finish was ""incredibly humbling."" Sanford, 52, had taken heat from his opponents in the crowded GOP primary field who criticized him for his past and for being a ""career politician."" Sanford's re-entry into politics comes after an extramarital affair derailed his marriage and political career. As governor, he infamously told the public in 2009 he was hiking the Appalachian Trail while he was actually traveling to Argentina to carry on the affair. He and his then-wife, Jenny, divorced in 2010, and Sanford finished his second term in January 2011. The experience, he told CNN, changed his perspective. ""If you went through the level of destruction that I brought about it my own life, you have this yearning to construct something,"" he said in 2011. ""We get our priorities mixed up in life. Fundamentally life is about relationships -- relationship to God and relationship to those around us."" He and his ex-wife, Jenny, were almost pitted against one another on the GOP primary ballot in March after both indicated their interest. But in January, Jenny Sanford said she would not seek the nomination, leaving Mark Sanford to formally announce his bid. He is currently engaged to Maria Belen Chapur, the woman with whom he carried on the affair. Chapur, who rarely appears in public with Sanford, was by his side during his victory speech. The seat is up for a May 7 special election after Rep. Tim Scott resigned it upon his appointment to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by Jim DeMint's resignation. Sanford is expected to face a tough bid for the seat against Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch, the sister of TV political commentator Stephen Colbert. And this time around, Sanford pitched himself as a fiscal conservative who spoke out on the issues of debt, deficit, and federal spending years ago, issues that are now very much at the forefront. ""We're having a new fiscal crisis, it seems, every couple months,"" he said. ""So what I want to do is take what I've learned and hopefully apply it to again a great conundrum that now exists in Washington, which is how do we get our financial house in order."" CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Catherine E. Shoichet, Jim Acosta, Paul Steinhauser, Kevin Liptak, Peter Hamby and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","NEW: Sanford's fiancee appeared with him during his victory speech .

"(CNN) -- Could sewage be recycled to provide water that's cleaner than what comes out of your tap? The place to find out is the small yet highly urbanized city-state of Singapore. The South-east Asian island country has a population of 5 million residing on less than 750 square kilometers of land. Whilst known for its strong economy, Singapore is lacking one essential asset -- water. Water security has long been a national priority in Singapore as half of its current water supplies are imported from neighboring Malaysia. ""We are preparing for the day that should the water agreement expire, we should be ready to fulfill our own needs,"" says Chew Men Leong, Chief Executive of the Public Utilities Board. The agreement with Malaysia is due to expire in 2061, so the country has time to be ready. Singapore's strategy for a hydrated nation is four-fold: as well as importation, it includes desalinization plants, efficient catchment of rainwater and recycling of sewage. Rainwater is collected through a network of drains, canals, rivers, storm water, collection ponds and reservoirs with the aim to catch water across two-thirds of the country. But the real hope lies in the membrane technology to treat wastewater known as 'NEWater', created by the country's public utilities board. Through a four-step series of barriers and membranes, wastewater is made free of solids, microorganisms, and contaminants resulting in potable water supplies for use by humans and industry. After one decade, the technology meets 30 percent of Singapore's water needs, with plans to triple volumes by 2060. ""The level of quality we receive from the Public Utility Board meets and exceeds the expectation,"" explains Jagadish CV, CEO of Systems on Silicon Manufacturing, where the water is used in their processing of silicon wafers. ""We are using the water three times before we let it into the drain,"" he says. The demand by industry is being further met by a new collaboration with Japanese firm Meiden that will supply factories with recycled industrial water. One and a half Olympic-sized swimming pools of water are currently filtered and treated every day. The goal is to more cost-effectively treat industrial waste streams in the long run. Professor Asit Biswas from the Lee Kuan School of Public Policy feels other countries should follow the example set by Singapore and even the current standards can be improved to eventually re-use every last drop of water. ""There are two major future challenges,"" he says. ""First is how to make the water system less energy intensive and the second one is consumer behavior with respect to water."" If these challenges can be overcome, this small country will continue to flourish, long into the future. Read more from Future Cities: . Shared space, where the streets have no rules .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Ethnic clashes in India's northeastern Assam province have left 32 dead as of Wednesday and sent an estimated 150,000 fleeing their homes to escape the violence, police said. Long-standing tensions between the predominant Bodo tribes people and minority migrant Muslim settlers erupted into bloodshed nearly a week ago and has largely gripped the province's Kokrajhar district, which borders on neighboring Bhutan to India's north, said Assam police chief J.N. Chaudhury. What sparked the mayhem is not yet known and under investigation, he said. But it has resulted in incidences of attacks and counter attacks between the two groups, CNN sister network CNN-IBN has reported. Five of those killed died when police fired on mobs engaging in rioting and arson, according to Chaudhury, who said that the district had witnessed similar fighting in the 1990s and the early 2000s. ""For now, our priority is to stop the violence and arson. It may take some days to rebuild trust,"" he said. Peace committees were set up between tribal and migrant communities when clashes erupted in the past, Chaudhury said. Angry mobs disrupted rail service by attacking train cars with bricks and sitting on tracks, bringing service to a standstill. R.S. Virdi, general manager of Northeast Frontier Railway, told CNN that 34 trains were held up at various stations. ""We are not originating any new trains until we have clearance from the state authorities,"" he said, adding that train service was being gradually restored as security personnel moved in. The Assam region, known around the world for its tea production, is also a major petroleum supplier, but the region has remained particularly poor. India is known for its diverse mixture of cultures, religions and ethnic backgrounds, which at times has led to conflict between groups. Assam has a high concentration of extremist groups of varying backgrounds, reflecting a checkerboard of ethnic and political interests. But police have not blamed any insurgent group in this week's violence, citing instead rioting mobs. Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi and Ben Brumfield, from Atlanta. CNN's Sumit Galhotra contributed to this report.","Tribes people and Muslim settlers have attacked and counter-attacked .

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities have an American citizen in custody who they say is suspected of trafficking firearms and grenades to a major Mexican drug cartel. According to Mexico's attorney general's office, Jean Baptiste Kingery Moinssonm was allegedly smuggling firearm and grenade parts into the country. Once the goods were in Mexican territory, Moinssonm allegedly assembled and sold the weapons to the Sinaloa cartel. Mexican federal police took Moinssonm into custody in Mazatlan, a beach resort in the Pacific state of Sinaloa, authorities said. According to a news release Tuesday from the attorney general's office, Moinssonm was the target of a joint investigation by Mexico's Anti-Organized Crime Unit (SIEDO) and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) on suspicion of smuggling grenade components and firearm parts through the border cities of Calexico, California; and Mexicali, Baja California. ATF officials were not immediately available for comment on the attorney general's statement. The statement said Moinssonm allegedly bought grenade components and firearm parts in gun shops in the United States and through the internet, and the weapons subsequently would be smuggled into Mexico for sale there. A Mexican judge issued an arrest and search warrant targeting an address in Mazatlan, where the suspect was living.  Mexican federal police said they seized a Hummer truck, three .22 caliber rifles and two collectible firearms. Mexican federal police said they searched five other addresses in Mazatlan tied to the suspect and found an active fragmentation grenade, gunpowder, parts for high-caliber rifles, bullets and grenade parts. Last April 13, Mexican police detained two Mexican suspects in the state of Baja California who were in possession of 192 inactive grenades, eight bullet-proof vests, and multiple firearm parts. The two suspects detained in Baja California blew the whistle on another American citizen who was detained August 11 in Mexicali, Baja California.  That suspect, identified by the Mexican attorney general's office as Habib Sayb Mujica, is being held under a 40-day detention order issued by a judge. Tuesday's statement from the attorney general's office said Mujica gave police information later used to capture Moinssonm in Mazatlan.","Mexican authorities say firearms and grenades were told to cartel members .

"Kokrajhar, Assam, India (CNN) -- On July 21, Abdul Kuddus was resting after a day of teaching his 82 primary school students. He reclined in the shade of his family's home in the Kokrajhar district of Assam, a state in northeast India bordering Bhutan and Bangladesh. Suddenly, his village came under attack. Men wielding guns, fired shots into the air and torched houses including his. Kuddus and his family ran to the forest and waited for the attackers to leave, watching their village burn to the ground. ""As we left the village later, I saw the school where I taught,"" said Kuddus. ""It was also gone -- burned."" More than 300,000 people, including Kuddus and his family, fled the riots that lasted for two weeks and burned their villages in western Assam. The riots started after the killings of two Muslims and four Bodos, a politically powerful tribal group in Assam, that heightened tensions between the two groups, according to local news reports and a human rights report. While the July riots were not the first violent incidents in Assam, the subsequent displacement is being called the biggest since India's independence. Ethnic clashes in India kill dozens, displace thousands . Many residents scattered in search of safety and fled to relief camps set up in schools in neighboring communities. As a result, the start of the academic year for tens of thousands of students has been canceled as classrooms became dormitories for the displaced. ""My students left for a one-month summer holiday on July 1,"" said Munir Islam, a principal whose school is a relief camp. ""They never came back."" Two months after the riots, hundreds of schools remain relief camps. Both the local people and the displaced are feeling the pressure. The Basugaon Higher Secondary School in Assam's Chirang district, enrolled 1,300 students and now houses more than 6,000 people. In early September, local students held a rally demanding that their school re-open, said Subal Roy, the principal. Even during the protest, Roy said, ""No one had an answer for how to get these people back to their villages safely."" Photos: Aftermath of ethnic riots in India . Ali Mohammed, a father of four, has lived in a relief camp at nearby Motilal Bogoria School for two months. ""The local people complain that their school is being used for the camp,"" he said. He worried about the disruptions in his children's lives, but did not think it was safe to return to their village yet. Texts trigger mass panic in Assam . ""Look at this situation,"" he said, gesturing at a group of children splashing through a puddle with garbage floating in it. ""Why would we want to stay here? ""It makes us feel bad to take the school from other people -- but where do we go?"" he asked. His 14-year-old son Ahmed added: ""We are using this school for a living place, not a school. We live in uncertainty day to day, just surviving here."" Experts are concerned that a gap in schooling could have immediate and long-term effects on children. ""Even if education is interrupted for just a few months, it can be difficult to get children back into schools,"" said Rebecca Winthrop, director of the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institute in Washington, D.C. ""Just a daily gathering of teachers and students to read together or discuss the fragile situation around them -- this sense of regularity helps."" Some schools have begun to improvise. At the Lakhiganj Higher Secondary School, administrators set up alternative sites for classes to take place. Some students have classes in a local sports club building, a small concrete structure near the school campus. When the monsoon rains stop and the ground dries, administrators said they plan to hold classes in nearby fields. But the alternative facilities are not an ideal substitute. ""There is no academic atmosphere,"" said teacher Rofyul Sheik, as he stood next to his corroded chalkboard in a small thatched building as the ceiling drooped in over his head. ""The students get distracted."" Observers say continuous education is crucial for the future stability of the region. ""Delaying the education of a student in a village because some other people burned it down -- the child will remember that. It will inform his politics for the rest of his life,"" said Berlao Karjie, professor of political science at Kokrajhar Government College. ""The memory of your school being taken over by desperate people fleeing violence can have a similar effect,"" he said. Monirul Hussein, head of the political science department at Gauhati University in Assam's capital, said: ""Education is the only hope for children to have a future, especially if their family's land is getting squeezed."" The July violence fomented amid the long history of political tension and land disputes in Assam. For decades, indigenous people, most prominently the Bodo tribe, have fought for autonomy. Bodos were granted territorial and political sub-autonomy by the Indian government in 2003. Since then, Muslims in the area claim they have been pushed off the land. The local issues in Assam have become touchstones for political debates across India. Rumors send thousands fleeing in India . ""We have failed as a state to manage our diversity,"" said Hussein. A recent report on the violence by the Delhi-based Asian Centre for Human Rights claims that a lack of political will to intervene allowed the July riots to take place and that this permits the suffering of students to continue. ""What we're seeing now in the government's lack of action on the education issue is the same kind of negligence,"" said Suhas Chakma, the center's director. About 200,000 people remain in the cramped relief camps. Most are Muslim families; some are undergoing verification to prove they are Indian citizens, which could take months since many lost documents in their scorched homes. Unavailable to speak with CNN, Assam's education minister stated in late August that schools must re-open, but no official decision has been implemented.","300,000 people fled villages in Assam after ethnic tension and riots .

"(CNN) -- Willie Nelson said Friday that he felt he had no choice but cancel a gig at SeaWorld, given public pressure and his own conviction that the way the aquatic entertainment giant operates is not acceptable. ""I don't agree with the way they treat their animals,"" Nelson told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""It wasn't that hard a deal for me."" The country music legend's comments come one day after SeaWorld Orlando spokesman Nick Gollattscheck said Nelson would not be part of next year Bands, Brew & BBQ events ""due to scheduling conflicts."" But the 80-year-old crooner didn't mention scheduling having played any part in his rationale. Rather he nixed the show because he does not agree with SeaWorld's treatment of its orca, or killer, whales and other sea creatures -- a sentiment that has spread among those who have seen ""Blackfish"" documentary that aired on CNN on the topic. He isn't alone. The Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies also pulled the plug on their show at the Florida theme park for similar reasons, a decision made two days after drummer Tyler Stewart tweeted the group was ""looking at options"" after seeing ""Blackfish"" and after an online petition urged them to do so. SeaWorld responds to questions about captive orcas, 'Blackfish' film . Nelson pointed to similar efforts asking him to follow suit. The most meaningful, even if it had just a few hundred signatures, may have come from one of Nelson's grandchildren, with ""people she knew asking me not to play this venue."" Another petition had 9,000 names attached to it on Change.org, with author Danielle Legg writing that Nelson's ""activism for animals, the environment and other good causes"" made it imperative that he cancel his show, in light of the documentary. When his decision became public, Legg declared ""victory"" and said she hoped his and the Barenaked Ladies' decisions ""will inspire other artists to stay away from performing at SeaWorld because at least they've got the choice -- unlike the animals trapped there."" Such public pressure wasn't insignificant, but Nelson said he acted because he felt it was the right thing to do. Many zoos can be considered ""cruel"" for how they hold animals, the singer said, adding that he wouldn't blame a captive monkey ""for wanting to throw stuff at you."" ""I understand that there are some natural-habitat zoos out there, which is probably OK,"" Nelson added. ""But what they do at SeaWorld is not OK.""

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer strengthened his grip on the top spot in the world rankings with a crushing 6-0 7-6 victory over Novak Djokovic Sunday in the final of the Cincinnati Masters 1000 tournament. The Swiss maestro needed just 80 minutes to clinch his fifth title at the hard court tournament and claim the 1,000 ranking points on offer, against 600 for Djokovic, the world number two. Federer took ruthless advantage of claiming three of his four break point opportunities to sweep through the opener without dropping a game. The second set was closer, but Djokovic was unable to force a single break point on the Federer service as it went to a lengthy tiebreaker. Djokovic held a set point at 7-6 but Federer saved it with bold play and swept the next two points to clinch a morale boosting victory ahead of the final grand slam of the season in the U.S. Open at Flushing Meadows. The scoreline was similar to the last time the pair met in the Cincinnati final in 2009 when Federer won 6-1 7-5 and he has extended his career lead over the Serbian to 16-12. Federer, who claimed the Wimbledon crown and took silver in the Olympic singles to Andy Murray, has charged back to number one and reached the Cincinnati final without dropping a set. ""I've had a magical summer. I feel good about New York -- but I'm going to savor this one for a bit."" Federer said in his post-match interview. Djokovic, who took the season opening grand slam in Australia, will be defending his U.S. Open title when it starts in New York on August 27. Federer's victory in the final gives him his 21st Masters 1000 title, drawing level with Rafael Nadal of Spain, who is sidelined by a knee injury. Defending Cincinnati champion Murray made a shock early exit to France's Jeremy Chardy. China's Li Na later won the accompanying WTA tournament with a 1-6 6-3 6-1 victory over Anqelique Kerber of Germany in the final. It was the ninth seed's first title since her French Open triumph 15 months ago.","Roger Federer beats Novak Djokovic to win Cincinnati Masters .

"Capitol Hill (CNN) -- The politics of fear. Until recently, that seemed so 10 years ago, right after September 11, 2001. That is, until ISIS started beheading Americans. Now, just six weeks before Election Day, security concerns could be a September surprise that shakes up the midterms. Across the country GOP candidates on the ballot in November are using the threat posed by ISIS to dust off an old playbook -- attack Democratic opponents as weak on national security. The sun had barely come up Tuesday after a night of new United States and coalition airstrikes in Syria, when New Hampshire Republican Senate challenger Scott Brown released an ad using an ominous image of a fighter holding a black ISIS flag, while Brown talks about the threat from ""radical Islamic terrorists."" Brown, a retired member of the Army National Guard, touts his own experience in the ad before putting up side-by-side pictures of his Democratic opponent, Jeanne Shaheen, and President Obama, saying, ""President Obama and Senator Shaheen seem confused about the threat, not me."" This ad could hit particularly close to home in New Hampshire; James Foley, the American journalist beheaded by ISIS, was from the Granite State. Related: James Foley's mother ""appalled"" by U.S. government . But Republican strategists tell CNN that ads like this are driven by voter data from focus groups and polling all over the country, which signals that security is a rising priority among voters, especially with married women who Republicans rely on in midterm elections. Neil Newhouse, a GOP pollster who does work in several competitive races this year, tells CNN security is now a ""top-tier issue that no one saw coming."" CNN Poll: Spike in terror fears . In addition to his work for campaigns, Newhouse has polled for years on what he calls ""Walmart Moms"" -- female voters with children 18 or younger at home and shop at Walmart at least once a month. During focus-group interviews Newhouse and colleagues conducted earlier this month in Arkansas and Iowa, two key battleground states this November, ""Walmart Moms express specific concern about ISIS,"" Newhouse said in a memo about the data. ""This is an unusual for swing voters and not a common theme we have heard in previous groups,"" the memo said. Rep. Greg Walden, the Oregon Republican in charge of getting more House Republicans elected in November, also told reporters last week that national security issues were ""popping"" in opinion polls. The National Republican Congressional Committee is jumping on that -- rolling out four security-related television commercials last Friday in competitive races, including spots that warned Democrats' positions make them ""dangerous"" in the face of new threats from ISIS. Walden cited ""security moms"" as a key group he believes are already gravitating towards Republican candidates. The issue, however, could ensure they go from supporting Republicans to actually making sure to vote. Two new ads were released on Tuesday -- more proof that Republicans are all in on this new security strategy. Back to the Future? Both Republican and Democratic campaign strategists say this mirrors the approach the GOP used effectively in 2002 and 2004. To former Georgia Sen. Max Cleland -- it is eerily familiar. ""That's exactly what they did to me,"" Cleland told CNN in a telephone interview. In 2002, the year after 9/11, his GOP opponent Saxby Chambliss ran ads calling him weak on national security. Despite the fact that Cleland was a Vietnam War veteran who lost three of his four limbs on the battlefield, Chambliss' attacks resonated with Georgia voters and Cleland lost his Senate seat. Cleland says there were a lot of other reasons for his defeat, but that certainly was a factor. So what is his advice to Democrats like Shaheen who are coming under fire on the New Hampshire campaign trail now? ""Fight like hell and tell the people of New Hampshire this is b*llsh*t,"" said Cleland. ""The Republicans will use any advantage. If the economy was sucking air they would do that now,"" Cleland added. Shaheen did in fact release a statement Tuesday pushing back on Brown's ad questioning her national security chops, saying ""I have supported and will continue to support aggressive action to destroy ISIL in Iraq and Syria."" She's not the only Senate Democrat under attack on security. Republicans in North Carolina are hitting Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan for failing to focus on the terror threat. Hagan is locked in a tight race with GOP candidate Thom Tillis. The National Republican Senatorial Committee and Tillis tweeted out a chart on Monday that showed that Hagan had missed half of the hearings on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and as chair of a subcommittee on emerging threats, had not held a hearing on the terror group ISIS at all. A spokesman for Hagan acknowledges she did miss Armed Services Committee hearings because they conflicted with other Senate work. But Democrats deny that Kagan ignored ISIS in the subcommittee she chairs, saying she held several hearings on counterterrorism, and that Iraq and al Qaeda have been a major focus of all of them. ISIS is such a big threat, the Armed Services Chairman wanted to chair hearings on the issue before the entire committee. Hagan aides are fighting back by slamming Tillis for not taking a position on whether to arm and train Syrian rebels, which Hagan voted for. Obama offers 'broad vision of American leadership' in U.N. speech . Democrats Push Back . There is some evidence Democrats are worried that what they call ""the politics of fear"" could work against them. Former Iowa state Rep. Staci Appel, who was targeted by the NRCC on Friday, scrambled an ad of her own on the air to respond. The GOP used footage of Appel's response to a question in a recent debate, and suggested she would not support taking away U.S. passports from suspected terrorists. Appel responded in her new ad by speaking directly to camera and calling her GOP opponent David Young's charge ""a lie."" ""I support revoking passports for terrorists,"" said Appel in the ad. Still Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg argues the concept of a ""security mom"" -- the kind of voter being targeted in these new ads -- doesn't exist. She says it's a myth. ""We should not conflate an expression of concern about terrorism with it as a driver of vote choice,"" says Greenberg in a blog for the Huffington Post. ""Voters typically look to the President and to the military for security, not to members of Congress,"" says Greenberg. ""Moreover, there is a world of difference between where we are now and where we were just after the 9/11 attacks."" On that, GOP pollster Neil Newhouse agrees, calling today's security concerns much lower than they were in the two elections after 9/11. Still, he insists it has resonance -- especially given how close the ISIS beheadings happened to Election Day. The chairman of the Democratic Campaign Committee, Rep Steve Israel of New York, says he still believes that middle class economics, not national security, is the dominant factor in how most people will vote. Share your view on the airstrikes . Israel also argues that this GOP strategy will turn off independent and swing voters in key races. ""They [independent voters] want to be united during a time of threat and don't want a political party to divide Americans,"" Israel told CNN. ""Using ISIL as a political tool is meant as a strategy to turn out their base, but the inherent problem in pushing partisanship is losing persuadable voters,"" he said, predicting it would ""backfire"" But Walden, Israel's GOP counterpart, says talking security on the campaign trail is a legitimate issue and fair game. Walden told reporters that its' important for GOP candidates to engage voters on issues they are talking about, and recent developments in the Mideast have made national security one everyone is talking about. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","GOP reviving politics of fear as nation worries about terror threat .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City are the champions of England once more after clinching the EPL title on the season's final day. City defeated West Ham 2-0 at the City of Manchester Stadium Sunday putting them out of reach of second placed Liverpool who themselves defeated Newcastle United 2-1 at Anfield. Samir Nasri and Vincent Kompany scored the goals for City on a day that was less dramatic than the last time the blue half of Manchester secured the Premier League crown (City scored two injury time goals against QPR to win the title in the final game of the 2012 season) but the celebrations were just as jubilant and colorful. Triumphant City fans invaded the pitch to congratulate their heroes at the final whistle, setting off flares and blue smoke bombs before clearing away so the trophy could be presented. ""It's an amazing feeling. There is no word to explain our feeling right now,"" City's French midfielder, Nasri told Sky Sports after the final whistle. ""I'm just so happy for the manager (Manuel Pellegrini) as well because its his first title in Europe. He's done an amazing job. He remained calm all season."" The triumph marks City's second title win in three seasons but just the fourth in the clubs 134-year-history. Bankrolled by the immense wealth of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and the Abu Dhabi Investment Group, City have been a near unstoppable attacking force all year. Big money signings such as Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero, Alvaro Negredo, David Silva and Samir Nasri -- all brought to the club in the time since Sheikh Mansour's reign began in 2008 -- have each been outstanding. ""I manage a great group of players and a great institution,"" said City manager, Pellegrini. ""(It's a) very special group. Maybe they were in a difficult moment when I arrived. They believe in the way I play and we try to play the year in the right way."" ""This whole year comes from a lot of work without and within ... at the last, this was the best team in the league. City's captain Vincent Kompany added to his manager's sentiments: ""I'm so happy. I think this team has more than just talent. It's got heart and real soul."" Liverpool fall short . Over at Anfield, the mood was decidedly less celebratory despite the home side coming from behind to beat Newcastle United 2-1. Eleven consecutive victories had made Liverpool favorites for the title before they dropped points at home to Chelsea and then away Crystal Palace in recent weeks. Victory on the final day means they finish the season two points behind City in second place. Liverpool Captain Steven Gerrard was magnanimous in defeat although put perspective on what was ultimately a successful year for the Anfield club whose main aim was to finish in the top four and secure a Champions League place for next season. ""(I'm) absolutely devastated, I can't sugar coat it. (But) we can't be too down its been a fantastic season. We need to bounce back and try go one better (next year)."" ""We have to congratulate Manchester City. They been the best over 38 games so congratulations to them."" Manager Brendan Rodgers echoed Gerrard's sentiments: ""We've been on an incredible journey this year."" ""To get to the top four was the aim. Its a real compliment that people have seen us challenging,"" Rodgers added. Final day roundup . Elsewhere in England, Norwich City's relegation was confirmed by a 2-0 defeat at home to Arsenal. The Canaries required victory and a massive swing in goal difference to have any chance of beating the drop. Goals from Aaron Ramsey and Carl Jenkinson, however, ensured Arsenal would go into next week's FA Cup final with Hull in buoyant mood. The only team that Norwich could have caught, West Brom, lost 2-1 at home to Stoke although the result was of little relevance due to Arsenal's victory. Ryan Giggs' time in temporary charge of Manchester United came to an end with a 1-1 draw at Southampton. England striker Rickie Lambert gave the Saints the lead before Juan Mata equalized for United. Giggs is widely expected to be replaced in the United hotseat by current coach of the Dutch national team, Louis van Gaal in the coming weeks. Everton secured fifth position and a place in next season's Europa League with a 2-0 victory away to Hull City while Tottenham overcame Aston Villa 3-0 at White Hart Lane. In the day's remaining fixtures, Chelsea came from behind to beat already relegated Cardiff City, Fulham and Crystal Palace drew 2-2 while Swansea defeated in-form Sunderland 3-1 at the Stadium of Light.","Manchester City defeat West Ham to secure EPL title .

"(CNN) -- Andres Iniesta pipped Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo to win the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award Thursday. The 28-year-old midfielder was named Player of the Tournament as Spain won Euro 2012 and was in brilliant form for the Catalan giants all season. Iniesta received his trophy from UEFA president Michel Platini at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco where earlier the Champions League draw had been made. ""I am very honored and I dedicate this award to my Barcelona and Spain teammates,"" said Iniesta. ""I am privileged to be here with two such great footballers as Leo and Cristiano.""

Iniesta broke Emilio Butragueno's record of 50 La Liga matches without defeat during the course of last season but he was on the losing side in game 56 as Ronaldo's Real won 1-0 at the Camp Nou in April to clinch the La Liga crown. He has won every honor in the game in a glittering career, scoring the extra time goal as Spain beat the Netherlands 1-0 in the 2010 World Cup final in South Africa.

"(CNN) -- The World Health Organization vowed Saturday to make public a full review of its response to the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa once the crisis is under control. But the United Nations health agency, which is among those leading the battle against a scourge that has claimed more than 4,500 lives in West Africa, declined to comment on a scathing internal document, cited in an Associated Press report, describing its response as botched and riddled with incompetence. ""Nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall,"" WHO said in the document, according to the Associated Press. ""A perfect storm was brewing, ready to burst open in full force."" WHO called the leaked document a first draft that had not been fact-checked or reviewed by its staff as part of its continuing review of the response. ""We cannot divert our limited resources from the urgent response to do a detailed analysis of the past response,"" WHO said in a statement. ""That review will come, but only after this outbreak is over."" A timeline of the outbreak showed that WHO missed opportunities to stop the spread of the disease after it was first diagnosed in West Africa, the Associated Press reported. The document also said WHO experts failed to recognize that traditional containment methods wouldn't work in the region. The leaked document said that Dr. Bruce Aylward, normally in charge of polio eradication, alerted WHO Director-General Margaret Chan via email in June that national health organizations and charities believed the U.N. agency was ""compromising rather than aiding"" the Ebola response. ""None of the news about WHO's performance is good,"" Aylward wrote, according to the Associated Press. According to the WHO, there have been more than 9,200 confirmed, probable or suspected Ebola cases since the outbreak began months ago, with more than 4,500 deaths. Those figures -- documenting cases in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States -- likely underestimate the impact, since many cases were never diagnosed, especially in locales that are more remote, do not have a vibrant health care system or do have stigmas that may have led some not to seek treatment. And, authorities warn, it could get exponentially worse if the world doesn't step up. Opinion: Where's the empathy for Ebola's African victims? Appeals for countries to do more in Ebola fight . This response goes well beyond the World Health Organization. The United Nations last month appealed to countries to contribute $1 billion toward corralling the outbreak in West Africa. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday that only one-third of that figure has been raised. Without a concerted effort by the international community, Kerry said, ""Ebola has the potential to become a scourge like HIV or polio that we will end up fighting -- all of us -- for decades."" The secretary made the remarks to a room of foreign ambassadors at the State Department in Washington. He called on them to use their influence to bring stronger commitments to the Ebola fight, which has plagued Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, and has spread as far as the United States and Europe. Despite the political differences between Cuba and the United States, the Caribbean island has also joined the fight against the deadly virus. In an editorial published on Saturday, former leader Fidel Castro said he would ""gladly cooperate with American personnel on this task."" ""We understand that in carrying out this task with the maximum preparation and efficiency, we will be protecting our people, and our brothers in the Caribbean and Latin America, and prevent its spread, which sadly has been introduced and could spread further in the United States, which has so many personal links and interchanges it maintains with the rest of the world,"" said Castro in Granma, the official newspaper of the central committee of the Cuban Communist Party. Castro also emphasized this is ""not in search of peace between the two countries that have been adversaries for so many years, but, in any case, for world peace, an objective that can and should be sought."" On Saturday, British Prime Minister David Cameron joined those appealing for aid in urging the European Union to invest 1 billion Euros ($1.3 billion) and send 2,000 aid workers to fight it. Canada contributed not money, but potentially life-saving medicine, to the cause on Saturday. Its Public Health Agency announced it will ship 800 vials of an experimental Ebola vaccine to the WHO in Geneva beginning Monday. ""Our nation didn't waste a minute to respond to international organizations' call for help to fight against the brutal epidemic unfolding in West Africa."" ""We understand that in carrying out this task with the maximum preparation and efficiency, we will be protecting our people, and our brothers in the Caribbean and Latin America, and prevent its spread, which sadly has been introduced and could spread further in the United States, which has so many personal links and interchanges it maintains with the rest of the world. We will gladly cooperate with American personnel on this task, and not in search of peace between the two countries that have been adversaries for so many years, but, in any case, for world peace, an objective that can and should be sought."" The results of clinical trials for the vaccine, which started at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland this month, are expected in December. The vaccine showed promising results in animal research, the agency said. Germ-zapping robot sets its sights on Ebola . France starts screening passengers on Guinea flight . Other countries, meanwhile, are focusing on combating or preventing Ebola within its border. This includes the United States -- which has seen a handful of cases, including one that ended in the death of Thomas Eric Duncan. Fears of an outbreak there led President Barack Obama to appoint an ""Ebola czar."" Ron Klain is a former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden and former Vice President Al Gore. France began screening air passengers, on the single daily flight arriving from Guinea, for symptoms of Ebola. Passengers were given forms to fill out and had their temperatures checked. In Spain, a nurse's assistant who contracted Ebola after caring for a missionary with the virus is being treated at the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid. Teresa Romero Ramos helped treat one of two Spanish missionaries who were brought to the hospital after becoming infected in West Africa. Both missionaries eventually died at the hospital. A special committee set up by the Spanish government to handle the outbreak said 87 people were being monitored for Ebola in Spain. Of those, 67 were at home under observation and have not displayed symptoms. At Carlos III Hospital, two patients with symptoms were being monitored along with 15 others who have not displayed any symptoms. In the Canary Islands, three other people were under observation. Romero was the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa in the current outbreak. Another Spanish missionary, who had returned from Liberia last week and was being monitored, has been released from the Carlos III Hospital, the special committee said Saturday. After the preliminary Ebola test came back negative earlier this week, the second test on the missionary also came back negative, a hospital source with direct knowledge said.

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- Raúl Castro has lived all his life in the shadow of his older brother Fidel. Raúl Castro has a reputation for ruthlessness but pushed for a move toward more capitalism in Cuba. Even when Fidel Castro underwent intestinal surgery in 2006 and Raúl Castro became Cuba's acting president, Raúl didn't make a public appearance for two weeks, until after photos assured the country that Fidel was alive. Smaller, less imposing and less charismatic than his brother, Raúl Castro has known for years that he was the man designated to take over. Yet the world knows fairly little about the longtime Cuban defense minister -- or what he would do as Cuba's new president. ""Is there going to be a transition here toward something?"" Raúl Castro once commented to reporters asking about post-Fidel Cuba. ""Yes, toward a better form of socialism and -- here's something you'll like -- toward a more democratic society."" What did he mean by ""more democratic society""? The world may soon know.  Watch how Raúl Castro has helped shape Cuba » . On Tuesday, Fidel Castro announced plans to resign as president and commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces after 49 years in power. It's widely expected that Raúl Castro will be named as the country's new president when the 31-member council of ministers meets Sunday. Always together . Fidel and Raúl Castro planned the Cuban revolution together. The brothers were born in Biran, the sons of a Spanish immigrant -- a rich landowner -- and the housemaid he eventually married. Raúl Castro was always by his older brother's side. Together, they plotted the 1950s uprising that became the Cuban revolution, brought Fidel Castro to power and gave birth to the first communist nation in the Western Hemisphere. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, which left Cuba on the brink of bankruptcy and starvation, it was Raúl Castro who insisted on allowing free enterprise farmers markets. He declared that ""beans have as much importance as cannons, if not more."" Analysts say the world may see more of that pragmatism. Six months ago, Raúl Castro began a ""national debate"" on the problems of the country, acknowledging high unemployment and other economic concerns. Raúl Castro is ""a man who's quite capable of showing flexibility when needed and quite capable of being hard-line when needed,"" said Harold Klepak, a professor at the Royal Military College of Canada. ""So it will be what is best for Cuba. What's best, I think, in his mind for the revolution and its continuity."" Different personalities . Known as a fiery public speaker, Fidel Castro is said to be rather stiff in social situations. Raúl Castro is seen as the more down-to-earth brother. He has a more common touch and enjoys parties and a good joke, according to those who have known him well. He's considered more the family man. And sister Juanita, who defected to the United States in 1964 and lives in Miami, says it is Raúl, not Fidel, who is the patriarch of the Castro clan. ""He's kept the family together,"" said Ann Louise Bardach, author of ""Cuba Confidential."" ""[Juanita] said he remembers everybody's birthday. He remembers everybody's anniversary. He goes to the graduations. He takes care of the gifts."" Still, in many ways, Raúl Castro is seen as more of a hard-liner than Fidel Castro. During the early years of the revolution, the younger Castro earned a reputation for being ruthless with his enemies. Grainy black-and-white video shows him making impassioned speeches in the early days of the revolution. Even before his brother announced his retirement, Raúl Castro said Fidel would be a hard act to follow. ""No one will ever again have as much authority as Fidel Castro has had, because of who he is, because he made a true revolution,"" 76-year-old Raúl Castro said. Still, he says only the Communist Party can guarantee continuity. And, as the architect of the Cuban army and its leader for 50 years, Raúl Castro has the military firmly behind him.

Shortly after the plane landed, an ambulance rushed Dr. Kent Brantly from Dobbins Air Reserve Base to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital. He's one of two Americans sickened by the deadly viral hemorrhagic fever last month while on the front lines of a major outbreak in West Africa. Video from Emory showed someone in a white, full-body protective suit helping a similarly clad person emerge from the ambulance and walk into the hospital. Hospital visitor: 'Oh, my God' Emory has said it will treat Brantly, 33, and fellow missionary Nancy Writebol in an isolation unit. The plane equipped with an isolation unit can only transport one patient at a time. It will now pick up Writebol in Liberia and bring her to Georgia early next week, said Todd Shearer, spokesman for Christian charity Samaritan's Purse, with which both Americans were affiliated. Brantly's wife, parents and sister cried when they saw him on CNN walking from the ambulance into the hospital, another representative of Samaritan's Purse said on condition of anonymity. His wife, Amber, later said she was relieved that her husband was back in the United States. ""I spoke with him, and he is glad to be back in the U.S.,"" she said in statement. ""I am thankful to God for his safe transport and for giving him the strength to walk into the hospital."" Brantly's wife visited with him from behind a glass wall for about 45 minutes, the Samaritan's Purse representative said. Kent Brantly was described as ""in great spirits and so grateful."" Tennessee doctor who worked with Ebola patients quarantines self . Brantly, who has ties to Texas and Indiana, and Writebol, of North Carolina, became sick while caring for Ebola patients in Liberia, one of three West African nations hit by an outbreak. Treatment in isolation . This will be the first human Ebola test for a U.S. medical facility. The patients will be treated at an isolated unit where precautions are in place to keep such deadly diseases from spreading, unit supervisor Dr. Bruce Ribner said. Everything that comes in and out of the unit will be controlled, Ribner said, and it will have windows and an intercom for staff to interact with patients without being in the room. Ebola is not airborne or waterborne, and spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. There is no FDA-approved treatment for Ebola, and Emory will use what Ribner calls ""supportive care."" That means carefully tracking a patient's symptoms, vital signs and organ function and taking measures, such as blood transfusions and dialysis, to keep patients stable. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Ebola will go global . ""We just have to keep the patient alive long enough in order for the body to control this infection,"" Ribner said. Writebol was given an experimental serum this week, Samaritan's Purse said, though its purpose and effects weren't immediately publicized. The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. They later progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function -- and sometimes internal and external bleeding. Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA, a Christian mission organization with which Writebol also is linked, said Saturday that both were seriously ill but stable. ""My last report (on Brantly) was yesterday. ... He was ambulatory, being able to talk, converse, and get up. So that was encouraging,"" Johnson said Saturday morning. On Writebol, Johnson said: ""She's responsive, and we're encouraged at how she's doing."" Emory's isolation unit was created with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based down the road. It aims to optimize care for those with highly infectious diseases and is one of four U.S. institutions capable of providing such treatment. The World Health Organization reports that the outbreak in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea is believed to have infected 1,323 people and killed more than 729 this year, as of July 27. Fear, conspiracy theories . As officials worked to bring the two Americans home, the idea of intentionally bringing Ebola into the United States has rattled many nerves. ""The road to hell was paved with good intentions,"" wrote one person, using the hashtag #EbolaOutbreak. ""What do we say to our kids When they get sick& die?"" On the website of conspiracy talker Alex Jones, who has long purported the CDC could unleash a pandemic and the government would react by instituting authoritarian rule, the news was a feast of fodder. ""Feds would exercise draconian emergency powers if Ebola hits U.S.,"" a headline read on infowars.com. Ribner repeatedly downplayed the risk for anyone who will be in contact with Brantly or Writebol. ""We have two individuals who are critically ill, and we feel that we owe them the right to receive the best medical care,"" Ribner said. The fight against Ebola . All concerns about the United States pale in comparison to the harsh reality in the hardest-hit areas. Even in the best-case scenario, it could take three to six months to stem the epidemic in West Africa, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC. There's no vaccine, though one is in the works. There's no standardized treatment for the disease, either; the most common approach is to support organ functions and keep up bodily fluids such as blood and water long enough for the body to fight off the infection. The National Institutes of Health plans to begin testing an experimental Ebola vaccine in people as early as September. Tests on primates have been successful. So far, the outbreak is confined to West Africa. Although infections are dropping in Guinea, they are on the rise in Liberia and Sierra Leone. In the 1990s, an Ebola strain tied to monkeys -- Ebola-Reston -- was found in the United States, but no humans got sick from it, according to the CDC. Experts: U.S. health care system well-prepared for Ebola . CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Greg Botelho, Deanna Hackney, John Branch, Danielle Dellorto, Barbara Starr, MaryLynn Ryan and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Kent Brantly visited with his wife, separated by glass wall, for 45 minutes .

"(CNN) -- In a shocking article on TheAwl.com, author and mother Amy Sohn writes that moms in her affluent Brooklyn neighborhood are going through something called ""the 40-year-old reversion."" The tedium of raising children, she says, is driving moms in her circle out at night to party to the extreme as if they were 25 again. Sohn likens the scene to the HBO show ""Girls,"" which depicts life in New York for the post-college crowd: ""...We're masturbating excessively, cheating on good people, doing coke in newly price-inflated townhouses, and sexting compulsivelyâ€”though rarely with our partners. Our children now school-aged, our marriages entering their second decade, we are avoiding the big questionsâ€”Should I quit my job? Have another child? Divorce?â€”by behaving like a bunch of crazy twentysomething hipsters. Call us the Regressives."" It's a grim portrait of parenthood and marriage. And cringe-worthy tales of a drunk mom falling down the stairs while leaving a party and a mom who went to third base in the back of a minivan with a man who wasn't her husband could make a person who's thinking about getting pregnant hit the pause button. Sohn's salacious revelations have some people suggesting she made it all up: Her new novel comes out in August, after all. (When I contacted Sohn directly and asked if everything she wrote was true, she referred me to her publicist, who said the author wasn't doing interviews until the book releases.) But when I think about it, I've encountered plenty of this mischief myself, particularly the cheating. A former co-worker once described how a mom of three threw herself at him on a business trip, claiming she was having a hard time at home and really needed to have sex with him or she'd die. Sort of like he was a missing vitamin. If there's an uptick in Moms Gone Wild behavior among the Brooklyn co-op set, it wouldn't be anything new. Heck, if ""Mad Men"" is any measure, this generation's mommies were regularly tucked into bed by parents already three sheets to the wind before heading out to the neighborhood key party. Cultural depictions of modern motherhood tend to be much tamer, however. When I became a mom, I never expected I'd go out nearly as much as I do. I thought I'd always be home knitting mittens, singing lullabies and falling into exhausted sleeps on top of my husband. Sure, I do all that stuff (except the knitting). But I also go out for cocktails and adult conversation every couple of weeks or so. Mind you, the first time I hit the town post-baby was a bit of a disaster. New York was in the grips of the worst blizzard it had seen in decades. But I was oblivious; I'd barely been outside since my daughter's birth three weeks earlier. And the intensity of new motherhood combined with winter confinement was seriously tugging at my sanity. A kind of courtship: Finding a mom friend in the big city . ""It's snowing pretty heavily out there,"" my husband cautioned. ""It is? We'll see,"" I said, zipping up my boots. As soon as I stepped outside, I was waist-deep in snow. But instead of going back indoors like a normal person, I waded oafishly through the powdery sea of white to get to the cab. Over drinks with friends at a bar downtown, I shared baby pictures on my phone, my eyes misting with pride. I laughed loudly at everyone's jokes -- even the average ones. It felt so wonderful to be out in the world again! But by the time the joint was clearing out, the storm had progressed mightily. Cabs and subways could no longer operate. I was stranded. So I did what every good parent warns you not to -- I accepted a ride from a stranger who was voluntarily circling the city in an off-road vehicle rescuing lost souls and delivering them home. My eyes scrunched shut the whole way uptown, I prayed that this nice man wasn't going to feed me to his rottweiler. I also prayed my daughter would never do anything this stupid. There's something about New York City that makes misbehaving seem a little less like misbehaving. It's like the city dares you to take risks and try new things while seductively whispering in your ear, ""I won't tell anyone."" I once struck up a conversation at a bar with two ladies in their early 40s, both married with kids, who were very comfortable admitting they were having affairs. ""My one piece of advice,"" one of them told me like it was a given I'd eventually need to know the ins and outs of cheating. ""Delete ALL your text messages. Delete, delete, delete."" I'm jealous of my baby -- a Mother's Day confession . Another sliver of wisdom, this time from a PR executive and mother of two grown children, was that if I was ever tempted by another man I should ""jump in with both feet"" regardless of my marital status. ""Falling in love isn't something you should ever pass up,"" she said. Even if it might tear my whole family apart? Of course it's not just a New York thing. When having dinner at a pub in Montclair, New Jersey, my girlfriend, a local, started pointing out patrons she knew who were at the bar cheating on their spouses. They were all parents and none of them seemed to be looking over their shoulders. Later she introduced me to a couple with kids who decided to make their marriage an open one after the wife's affair with a neighbor was exposed. Perhaps it's not so hard to see how some of this happens. To save money on sitters, it's often just one parent who goes out. After a few rounds at the bar, mom might start to actually feel a little on the single side. And her susceptibility to do something nutty might correlate to the challenging -- even desperate -- day she had. While I've not made out with a bartender or snorted cocaine off the back of a toilet seat recently, there has definitely been some less-than-honorable after-dark behavior since I became a mother. Sometimes you've just got to blow off a bit of parental steam. Nights out with my newly single friend Claire are often something to behold. One time we got into a heated, alcohol-fueled argument at a SoHo bar with a bunch of lawyers because one of them told me my dress was awful. The argument concluded when Claire threatened to take all the lawyers outside and ""hit their faces."" Then there was the time, emboldened by a couple of glasses of white, I told a stranger his girlfriend reminded me of a prostitute I'd seen in the paper. Claire scolded me and said I needed to work on channeling my inner Kate Middleton. Celebs and civilians alike expected to 'bounce back' after baby . While there's nothing wrong with a mom embracing her precious moments of freedom, there is certainly an old-fashioned expectation swirling that once thou hast procreated, thou shalt be home by 8 p.m. While enjoying the conversation at a concert after-party well past midnight a few months back, I kept getting worried glances from a dad. ""Shouldn't you be at home?"" he said. ""Should we get you into a cab soon?"" Clearly his wife doesn't go out. After a while he just went quiet around me, as though he suspected that my partying was indicative of deep problems at home. Au contraire. Truth be told, I actually enjoy going out more now, simply because I'm a parent. There's a sense of accomplishment that I haven't felt before, having co-created this awesome little creature who giggles her way through the day. These days I feel lighter and happier when I'm on the town. I laugh more because my baby constantly reminds me how funny we all are. I relax more because I know it's useless wasting rare moments away from the house on being uptight. Also, the pressure's off. I'm one of the lucky ones who doesn't have to size up every dude in the bar to see if they fit the husband mold. My husband is at home playing video games or dozing peacefully in the room next to my sleeping kid. Or, even better, it's date night and he's right in front of me topping up my wine. My nights out end the same way, with me going back to a home that makes me happy. I'd like to think I'm progressing, not regressing. Sure, I'm not perfect, as a few benders with Claire can attest to, but I seem to be getting the balance down. Meanwhile, the party moms who delight in taking things into the danger zone didn't invent the art of smoking illicit joints and having tawdry affairs. They're just keeping the torch (or bong, or hot sex flame, whatever the case may be) alive. Yes, it's all been done. The question is, will it be their undoing? Revisiting battlegrounds of the sexes .

"(CNN) -- And so au revoir, Normandy. The seventh FEI World Equestrian Games proved the biggest and best yet as records tumbled, crowds soared and the excitement never seemed to end. The picturesque French coastline welcomed almost 570,000 spectators to the Games as a record 12 nations took part in a competition which was beamed to 200 territories across the globe. But which were the highlights to savor? Here, CNN looks back over five of the most memorable moments from the past fortnight. Dujardin delight . There is not a hotter rider in the world of dressage at the moment. Charlotte Dujardin is a serial winner and she underlined that with two individual gold medals and a team silver in Normandy. Dujardin is Britain's most successful dressage rider in history and holds the Olympic, world and European titles. She also owns all three world record scores in freestyle and set tests, so it was little surprise that she grabbed victory in Caen. On her beloved Valegro, she won the individual grand prix and freestyle events as she showed why she's the undisputed No. 1 once again. Dubbeldam's double . Jeroen Dubbeldam's biggest career highlight might still be his jumping gold medal at the Olympic Games in Sydney 14 years ago but he turned on the style to steal the show in Normandy. The Dutchman won titles after triumphing in both the team and individual events, becoming the first rider from the Netherlands to achieve such a feat. In the final, each of the four riders take their own horse around the course before repeating the run on each of their rivals' mounts. After going clear on Zenith SFN, Dubbledam held his nerve to complete three more flawless rounds and edge out Frenchman Patrice Delaveau. ""With all three horses I had a fantastic feeling, totally different but all felt they wanted to jump the fences clear,"" he told reporters. ""Three minutes isn't long enough to change any horse, so what I did was try to find their strongest points and then bring those forward. ""Luckily I found the strong points of all three horses and they gave me wonderful clear rounds."" Vaulting victory . Great Britain's golden girl Joanne Eccles produced an electrifying performance to secure a second successive world vaulting title. The 25-year-old dentist, who hails from Kinross in Scotland, won gold in Kentucky four years ago but was even more impressive this time around after performing with her family's 20-year-old horse W.H. Bentley. A series of acrobatics and handstands wowed the judges following a four-day competition. ""It's an amazing feeling. We've been working hard this year but we wanted to come here and have a good time,"" Eccles told the BBC. ""We had nothing to prove. We wanted to show off what we could do."" In the men's competition, European titleholder Jacques Ferrari upstaged defending champion Nicolas Andreani as France won its first medals of the fortnight. ""This is a sign that I have reached the limit and the pinnacle of my career so I don't know what will follow after this,"" Ferrari said. The host nation then won a team medal in the discipline for the first time, behind champion Germany and Switzerland. Fabulous Flarida . Shawn Flarida, reining's only rider to break the $5 million milestone, enjoyed another golden Games after winning another two world titles in Normandy. The U.S. star followed up team gold by sealing top spot in the individual competition. Riding seven-year-old Spooks Gotta Whiz, Flarida denied Andrea Fappani in the final run -- while their U.S. teammate Mandy McCutcheon became the first woman to win an individual medal with bronze. Two golds at the 2002 Games in Jerez and another team gold in Kentucky four years ago, means Flarida will go down in history as one of the finest riders in Games history. The 45-year-old celebrated by giving his medal to son Sam. ""He's a real horse enthusiast and he told me we'd have to work hard for this tonight, so I thought it would be fitting if I handed it to him,"" Flarida told reporters. Exell excels . It may look like a scene out of a movie but there was no twist in the plot in the final of the driving competition. Boyd Exell clinched a third consecutive world title after recording an astonishing clear round much to the delight of the watching fans. The UK-based Australian beat second-placed American Chester Weber and European champion Theo Timmerman of the Netherlands to secure gold. ""It was a huge relief,"" Exell told reporters. ""We had a good show throughout the weekend, but not a perfect show. The cones went really well for me although the arena was moving a lot. ""I knew Chester would have a clear round because he has been driving clear rounds all season. He has the best cones team. ""It is great to be the world champion again and I would like to thank my entire team for their great support."" What do you think?

"(CNN) -- Autonomous vehicles, levitating trains and supersonic tubes have all been suggested as radical ways to transport us faster as the new urban age approaches, but it seems the real secret to a faster commute has been with us all along -- the bus. Bus rapid transit (BRT) systems are paving the way for sustainable, efficient, and affordable travel and now operate in 181 cities worldwide. But they're not just your regular bus service. Exclusive bus lanes dominate the center of roads, prepaid tickets prevent delays when boarding and raised platforms at bus stops make you level with the bus floor to get on. These small details all make for a smooth, slick service to help you reach your destination in record time and its nothing new, the first system was pioneered 40 years ago. The Rede Integrada de Transporte (RIT) in the town of Curitiba, Brazil began service in 1974. Industrial growth saw the city's population grow by 5.3% per year in the 1970's and this rapid influx of new people living and working in the city called for new urban design and led to this innovative use of buses in their own infrastructure by the mayor and architect Jaime Lerner. His design of a 'subway on wheels' transported 50,000 people daily back in the 80s and today sees over 2 million passengers step on board each day. Six circular routes radiate around the city in both directions and in dedicated lanes, enabling frequent services. Colour-coding of buses also makes it easier to know if you;re on the right track. This bus-based infrastructure is significantly cheaper to build than going underground like the metro systems seen in other cities such as London and New York. Thirty-three cities in Brazil now host a BRT, as well as a further 26 across the rest of Latin America. The continent is setting the example for the field but has its own social challenges to overcome with its users. One of the main goals of these systems is to remove the social snobbery associated with taking the bus by offering a faster service that people can't refuse. This was accomplished in Curitiba when the buses first appeared but new high-income earners are offering resistance. Curitiba has one of Brazil's highest per capita ownership of private cars. The city's mayor Gustav Fruet is concerned he must convert a new generation. ""Cars are so accessible and relatively accessible,"" says Fruet. ""We have to convert a new public and how? Mainly with speed"". The lure is still faster travel but also convenience, with bus stops every 400 meters. But as with every growing city, populations begin to live further and further away from its epicenter. Human rights activist Luana Xavier Pinto feels the system no longer accommodates the working class who can no longer afford to live in the city and therefore within easy access to the BRT. ""They have been pushed to the metropolitan region where you don't have good integration with the system...they have to take longer and longer trips to get to work,"" says Pinto. The city has tried to overcome this with bigger, longer buses which encompass three buses in one. The result is a high-capacity bus capable of carrying 250 passengers at once -- as many as a Boeing 787. The priority now it to get people on board. The tried and tested technology of Curitiba has proven successful and the city has long been known as a laboratory for sustainability. So as the future approaches with daydreams of jetpacks and hovercrafts, the reality for us all may be not to miss the bus. Read more from Future Cities: .

"(CNN) -- While on a television program several years ago, I recounted a story about moving with my family into a new home in the suburbs of Washington. As a black family, we were welcomed to the neighborhood with a shocking sight. My mother and I looked out the kitchen window the morning after we moved in to notice that someone had driven across our new lawn, skidding over mom's cute dogwood tree, and placed a cross there to intimidate us. Not being wanted in this neighborhood based on the color of our skin made a fearful and lasting impression on me as a 9-year old. About a week after the show a letter came to my office. Penned by a man who identified himself as a ""White Fundamentalist Supremacist Christian,"" the letter was a fiery missal responding to my television appearance and underscoring his disdain for black people and his glee over the fact that I had a ""burning cross"" (I never said it was burning) in my front yard. I have this letter posted on the back of my office door with a note I wrote across it with a black sharpie: ""This is why God has called us to be gracists and ambassadors of reconciliation!"" As whites become minorities in America, traditional minority groups like mine will be called upon to graciously build bridges to help whites adjust to their new minority status without malice or vengeance. Diversity is an ever-evolving, rotating movement of new people and new perspectives in America. While the term may have been largely about blacks at one time, and more recently, Latinos, we find Koreans, Chinese and Filipinos filling up the melting pot. In some areas of the country, as in Michigan, it's the burgeoning Muslim population, or in Minnesota and Ohio, the growing populations of Somalis. Diversity is here to stay. Welcome to the realization of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. Yet, when King gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech, I wonder if he ever envisioned a day when whites in America would actually be the minority. Judging people by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin is altogether as important as it is for blacks. This will become increasingly the case in the decades to come. Integrating whites into the mosaic of American society is an important ideal to embrace, because integration has always been construed as mixing other minorities into a white-dominated world. Whites will become a minority within three decades, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If this happens as predicted, within little more than one generation, whites will be the largest minority group in America. In the United States we are in for a new age of diversity that all Americans should be aware of with eyes wide open. For the first time in U.S. history, the majority rule of whites will be threatened, which means the concept of rugged individualism that worked so well for whites in America in centuries past may be threatened. The rules of personal responsibility and relational networking (some call it the ""good old boy"" network) as an avenue for success will no longer be sufficient in a multicultural and global society. I predict the new minority whites will break into at least two groups: diverse whites, those who are culturally aware and multiculturally proficient, and reverse whites, those who will fight doggedly to hold on to whatever superior status they can. Other minorities, especially blacks, have a choice to be what I call ""gracists,"" people who extend favor, kindness, forgiveness and grace to others regardless of, and sometimes because of, color, class or culture. Whites will have the choice of retreating into fear and loathing or embracing their new status with understanding and grace. The integration of whites is not their sole responsibility. Gracism is the powerful assertion that each group should extend grace toward other groups, including minorities extending it to their former oppressor and whites extending it to others rather than protectionism out of fear. The more perfect union will become a reality if that union of gracists will realize that the dream of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. extends to all multicultural configurations and presupposes the coming together of all people as equally human. The factional system of dysfunctional diversity, where power structures are reserved for a majority race to dominate others, is being dismantled one generation at a time. The mosaic of more Americans sharing power beyond one or two dominating racial groups will demand new partnerships based on sociological-political ideas that will drive robust debates, giving birth to innovation and collaboration. The ugly beast of race baiting and power hoarding will not easily die, at least not without a vitriolic fight. In the not-so-distant future, we can expect that diverse whites and reverse whites will be at odds. Gracists must be present to step into the divide and integrate them both. Reverse whites who want to go back to the way things were will still write letters applauding fear mongering. White interest groups may subversively advocate for sustaining institutional structures that perpetuate inequality. The fear of loss of racial dominance may give birth to a growing number of whites feeling cultural disequilibrium. But diversity is here to stay. Immigration is our history. Unity has a chance at being our destiny. If we enter into this brave new world with a spirit of grace, our success as a multicultural, multi-ethnic nation will be a dream realized. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Anderson.","David Anderson: America sees diversity in many forms .

"(CNN) -- The United States will withdraw another 4,000 troops in Iraq by the end of October, the U.S. military commander in Iraq said in prepared testimony for a congressional hearing Wednesday. The top military commander in Iraq says the U.S. is on track to end its combat mission in Iraq by next year. U.S. Gen. Ray Odierno is expected to tell the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee that there has been a significant drop in violence in Iraq recently, according to the statement obtained by CNN. President Obama has said the U.S. combat mission in Iraq will end by August 31, 2010. Obama also said he plans to keep a range of 35,000 to 50,000 support troops on the ground in Iraq after combat troops are out. ""We have approximately 124,000 troops and 11 Combat Teams operating in Iraq today. By the end of October, I believe we will be down to 120,000 troops in Iraq,"" Odierno said in the remarks. Odierno said statistics show violence has dropped in Iraq. ""Overall attacks have decreased 85 percent over the past two years from 4,064 in August 2007 to 594 in August 2009, with 563 in September so far,"" Odierno said. ""In that same time period, U.S. military deaths have decreased by 93 percent, Iraqi Security Force deaths have decreased 79 percent."" Odierno said there were still security questions. ""Although security is improving, it is not yet enduring. There still remain underlying, unresolved sources of potential conflict,"" Odierno said. Odierno pointed to the August 19 bombings in Baghdad that targeted the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs that killed more than 100 people as an example of ongoing challenges in Iraq. However, Odierno gave a vote of confidence to the Iraqi forces who had taken over security for Baghdad after U.S. forces handed over control. ""The Iraqis wanted to be in charge; they wanted the responsibilities; and they have demonstrated that they are capable,"" he said.","Thousands more troops in Iraq expected to return to U.S. in October .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russia's president is fighting back: No, he did not steal a Super Bowl ring. And no, he's not rocking the diamond-encrusted prize on his finger, either. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman denied that the leader kept a Super Bowl ring that New England Patriots' owner Robert Kraft wanted back. Both sides agree that the ring, with its 124 diamonds, changed hands during Kraft's visit to St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2005. The New York Post reported on remarks made by Kraft, 72, at a New York awards gala Thursday. ""I took out the ring and showed it to (Putin). And he put it on and he goes, 'I can kill someone with this ring,'"" Kraft said, according to the New York Post. ""I put my hand out and he put it in his pocket, and three KGB guys got around him and walked out."" In the quotes used by the Post, Kraft did not specifically say that Putin stole the ring; the paper characterized his remarks that way in the headline and story. Kraft did say, however, that he had wanted the ring back. ""I had an emotional tie to the ring. It has my name on it."" The Patriots' owner said he then received a call from the White House at the time telling him it would be in the best interest of U.S.-Russian relations to claim it was a gift to Putin, the Post reported. Kraft said Thursday he played along. A few days after the 2005 incident, amid confusion as to whether the ring was a present or was kept by mistake, Kraft issued a statement saying it was a gift. That's the way Putin sees it, the president's spokesman said Sunday. ""What Mr. Kraft is saying now is weird,"" Dmitry Peskov said. ""I was standing 20 centimeters away from him and Mr. Putin and saw and heard how Mr. Kraft gave this ring as a gift."" The 4.94-carat ring is in the Kremlin's library, where all official state gifts are kept, he said. It is worth more than $25,000, according to multiple reports from 2005. A Kraft spokesman said Sunday the story is a humorous anecdote that Kraft ""retells for laughs."" ""He loves that the ring is at the Kremlin and, as he stated back in 2005, he continues to have great respect for Russia and the leadership of President Putin,"" said Stacey James, a spokesman for The Kraft Group. ""An added benefit from the attention this story gathered eight years ago was the creation of some Patriots fan clubs in Russia,"" he said. There is some solace for Kraft, as he also received rings for the Patriots' Super Bowl victories in the 2001 and 2003 seasons. Super Bowl rings can fetch much more when they are auctioned, depending on who wore them. The 1991 Super Bowl ring of Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor sold last year at auction for more than $230,000. There were rumors Charlie Sheen bought the ring, but the actor denied it. At least one ring has been used to raise money for charity. In 2008, former Patriots defensive player Je'Rod Cherry raffled off one of his three rings to raise $150,000 for several children's charities. Putin announces marriage split .

"(CNN) -- South African runner Caster Semenya took second place in her Olympic debut Wednesday, three years after a gender controversy sidelined her career and overshadowed her victory in the world championships. She qualified by finishing behind USA's Alysia Johnson Montano in the 800-meter heats. Semenya, 21, was the subject of a gender test by the International Association of Athletics Federations following her 2009 victory in Berlin at the world championships. She has since been cleared to compete. The controversial tests followed her explosion into the international scene when she won the world title at age 18. She crushed her rivals by streaking away to secure victory in a record 1:55.45 -- a time especially highlighted by her sudden rise from obscurity. Her masculine build, chiseled abs and deep voice fueled rumors about her gender, sparking an international outcry. Outraged South Africans rushed to her defense and accused the world of invading her privacy. Read more: Indian athlete under pressure to prove her gender . The organization's handling of her case also sparked widespread criticism over accusations that it was unclear what standards the world body was using to determine her gender. ""The questioning of her gender is based on stereotypical view of the physical features and abilities attributable to women. Such stereotypes demonstrate the extent of patriarchy within the world's sporting community,"" South Africa's minister of women, Noluthando Sibiya, said at the time. Officials for track and field's world governing body sidelined her for nearly a year before she was cleared to run against women in 2010 after undergoing gender and drug tests. While the governing body said it had cleared her to run as a woman, it declined to provide medical details on the case, citing confidentiality. Expert: Gender testing 'imperfect' for female athletes . ""I am thrilled to enter the global athletics arena once again and look forward to competing with all the disputes behind me,"" Semenya said after her clearance. ""Running is everything to me. When I am running, I am happy."" In addition to the gender scandal, she has suffered a series of setbacks, including withdrawing from the 2010 Commonwealth Games because of a back injury. She finished second in the 800 meters at the worlds in South Korea last year. But all the firestorm was in the past as Semenya -- who is coached by 2000 Sydney Olympics 800m champion Maria Mutola --carried the South African flag in the opening ceremony in London.

"(CNN) -- Weeks after a firefight in southern Afghanistan's Helmand Province, a story has emerged of a British pilot who was struck in the head by a bullet and still managed to safely land a helicopter full of casualties, medical personnel and troops. British TV host Mike Brewer says he was onboard the Chinook that day as Flight Lt. Ian Fortune, 28, was shot in the helmet, just above his eyes. Brewer, who was accompanied by a cameraman, was filming a series called ""Frontline Battle Machines"" for the Discovery Channel and was aboard Fortune's helicopter because it is the only surviving aircraft from the Falklands War, making it the oldest serving Chinook in the fleet. He told CNN Saturday that he expected that flight that took off about three weeks ago to be a relatively routine trip to pick up wounded Afghan soldiers. ""Instead, the Chinook ""landed in a firefight,"" Brewer said. ""There was a battle going on. On the way in we could never have imagined it would become this kind of mission."" Immediately after takeoff, the aircraft ""took a big shudder,"" someone called ""mayday, mayday"" on the radio, Brewer said, adding that he heard Fortune saying he had been shot in the face. Brewer said at this point, ""I was thinking it as the end of my days, and I was about to plummet to my death."" Still, Fortune was able to get the 20 or so people aboard the Chinook -- including a half-dozen injured Afghan troops -- back to Camp Bastion safely, he said. ""The aircraft controls were damaged. It was a lot of trouble to keep us in the air,"" Brewer said. ""I spoke to the co-pilot later. He said Ian would not let go of the controls. Even with blood pouring into his eyes, he would not let go."" A spokeswoman with Britain's Ministry of Defence confirmed that Fortune's helmet was struck by a bullet in an incident in the region several weeks ago, and that he sustained minor injuries. While she couldn't confirm the number of people aboard the helicopter, she did say Fortune landed the aircraft safely at Camp Bastion -- the main British base in Helmand province. The spokeswoman said Fortune was not speaking publicly about the incident. The story was first reported by London, England's ""The Sun"" on Friday, though why it was published weeks after the incident was not immediately clear. Brewer's documentary was originally slated to air in May, but has been rescheduled for the end of this year. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid a surprise visit to British troops in Afghanistan on Saturday, his office said. He went to Camp Bastion, the main British base in Helmand Province, as well as a police training college and a British forward operating base, or outpost, according to 10 Downing Street. Brown's office told news outlets of his visit to Afghanistan while he was in the country but asked that it not be reported until he left. CNN complied with the request. As Brown was making his visit, the Ministry of Defence announced a British soldier had been killed in Afghanistan on Friday. CNN's Jennifer Deaton, Khadijah Rentas and Caroline Paterson contributed to this report.","British pilot, struck in the head by a bullet, manages to land helicopter full of casualties .

"(CNN) -- The case of  two 12-year-old girls accused of stabbing their friend multiple times to impress a fictitious Internet bogeyman raises so many questions for parents: How can we be sure our children can truly separate reality from fantasy? What are the warning signs that children are confusing the two? And how on Earth can we keep tabs on everything they're consuming online? Police said the girls told them they attacked their friend on Saturday to win favor with Slenderman, a make-believe online character the girls said they learned about on a site called Creepypasta Wiki, which is filled with horror stories. Children of all ages are consumed with fantasy in books and movies such as ""Harry Potter, ""Twilight"" and ""The Vampire Diaries,"" and don't seem to have a problem making the distinction between what's real and what's not. But a story like this makes any parent wonder: Whoa, maybe my kid doesn't get it? Mary Ellen Cavanagh of Ahwatukee, Arizona, mom to an almost 14-year-old daughter and a 19-year-old son, said she sees the line between fantasy and reality ""thinning drastically among our youth."" ""I worry about it with my own daughter and her friends,"" Cavanagh said on Facebook, adding that her daughter and her friends enjoy relatively innocent fantasy shows on television and online. Still, she worries that their ""obsession"" could shift to a ""more violent genre at any moment."" ""I think today's generation has been desensitized by the various forms of media, and we as parents (myself included) have done a piss-poor job giving them proper guidance,"" Cavanagh said. Professor Jacqueline Woolley of the University of Texas at Austin's department of psychology studies children's thinking and their ability to make distinctions between fantasy and reality. She has found that by the age of 2Â½, children understand the categories of what's real and what's not, and over time, they use cues to fit things like unicorns, ghosts and Santa Claus into the real and not real boxes. By age 12, the age of the girls in question in this case, Woolley said, she believes children should have as good an ability to differentiate fantasy from reality as adults. ""I don't think that a 12-year-old is deficient or is qualitatively different from an adult in their ability to differentiate fantasy from reality, so I don't think they're lacking any basic ability to make that distinction at age 12,"" she said. Woolley did suggest, adding that she was purely speculating, that the fact that the frontal lobe of the brain is not fully developed until age 25 could be relevant in this case. The frontal lobe controls what's called executive functions, which include impulse control and planning in the sense of anticipating all the different aspects of an outcome. ""It may be kind of an inability to hold the potential consequences and reality in mind at the same time as you're holding potential consequences within your fantasy world in mind, whereas possibly an adult could sort of manage thinking about the consequences of both of those worlds at the same time,"" she said. On the other hand, she said, many children can create imaginary worlds and are able to differentiate what's happening in their make-believe worlds with what's going on in real life. ""I really don't think that you can put your finger on a cognitive deficit entirely,"" she said about this case. ""I mean it may have played some kind of role, but I think there's more going on."" When teens are 'temporary sociopaths' Criminologist Jack Levin, a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University, points to another possible trigger: the relationship between the two girls accused in the stabbing. ""I think it's the chemistry between these two girls. It was insane. Not in their minds but in their relationship,"" said Levin on CNN's ""@This Hour."" It may turn out that one of the girls was more troubled and that caused the relationship to take a tragic turn, he added. ""I call some teenagers and preteens temporary sociopaths,"" he said. ""They commit a hideous crime at the age of 12 or 13 that they wouldn't dare commit if you can get them to the age of 25, when their brain has developed more and they no longer have this kind of character disorder. And when you put them together with another youngster, you may ask for big trouble."" Linda Esposito, a licensed clinical social worker and psychotherapist in Los Angeles, said she has provided counseling to hundreds of 12-year-olds over the years, treating children in inner-city schools, foster care, protective custody and through private practice. ""And I've yet to encounter such cold-blooded minds,"" said Esposito, who hosts a blog on psychotherapy called Talk Therapy Biz. ""I imagine as the story unfolds, many red flags will be uncovered. Nobody just snaps, not even innocent-looking kids."" The role of media . Beyond any issues the girls were facing, their relationship and their ability -- or inability -- to separate reality from fantasy, there is another issue: the media, according to the leader of a watchdog group for children's media. ""What you see is kids who are at risk for violent actions or depression or anxiety and who feel those feelings more strongly can sometimes be motivated to act on them by images and stories in the media,"" said James Steyer, chief executive officer and founder of the nonprofit child advocacy group Common Sense Media. ""I think that the research is clear that there is a correlation between repetitive viewing of violence, for example, and increased aggressive behavior, as well as desensitization to violence,"" he said. OPINION: Do violent video games play a role in shootings? OPINION: Don't link video games with mass shootings . No one is blaming the media, Steyer said, but, ""We're also not saying it doesn't matter, because it does matter."" ""This is an issue and an ongoing issue. It's been true for many years. In a 24/7 digital media universe, it's that much more prevalent because it's so much harder to monitor."" What can parents do? That raises the question of what parents can do, especially when it seems impossible to know everything our children are doing online. ""Parents have to be involved and proactive before even allowing young children to become active online and must continue to monitor, educate and discuss behavior and situations throughout their teen years,"" Anna White Berry said on Facebook. She's a mom of two in Littleton, Colorado. ""Too many parents take a back seat because they either don't want to bother learning 'new' technology and sites or feel like they need to give their children privacy,"" she said. Warning signs for parents that their children may be having trouble absorbing what they're engaging with online, or differentiating fantasy from reality, include withdrawing from real friends, not engaging with other aspects of their lives, self-injury and injury to others, experts say. Steyer of Common Sense Media said the takeaway from this latest tragedy is the need for every parent to talk with their children, but he concedes that isn't always enough. ""I think that the key is you need to have an ongoing dialogue with your kids and learn what they're doing, and what they're watching, surfing and playing with and you can't always unearth everything,"" Steyer said. ""You try to be involved. You try to set context. You try to know, but it's not easy,"" he added. ""You can't blame the parents. There's no one factor involved. There's no one simple factor.""

"Banda Aceh, Indonesia (CNN) -- Ten years ago, a towering wall of water engulfed cities across the Indian Ocean, ravaging communities as far afield as Thailand, Indonesia, Somalia and Madagascar. The 2004 tsunami was sparked by a massive, 9.1 magnitude earthquake which struck off the western coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on Boxing Day. Aceh, Indonesia, located at the northern tip of Sumatra, bore the brunt of the tsunami, with an estimated 130,700 killed, 565,384 internally displaced while 199,766 houses were destroyed or damaged. Plan International, a children's rights organization was one of the first organizations to provide humanitarian aid to the city. Lamnga Elementary School, in Aceh, was reduced to a crumbled shell after the four-meter-high wave roared inland. How did school principal, Muhammad Saleh, struggling to cope with the loss of two daughters -- and nearly half his students - find the strength to rebuild a devastated school? Reliving the tsunami . It was early Sunday morning, when the now 54-year-old school principal was making breakfast for his wife and three daughters. The ground started to shake beneath their feet, and they realized that it wasn't like any other earthquake. Panicked, they ran -- Muhammad with his four-year-old daughter cradled in his arms, while his two other daughters followed hand in hand. Then the wave came. Ten years later, Muhammad still remembers the moment he watched the wave pull his youngest daughter under, right before his eyes. ""In that instant, it was as though my breath escaped me,"" says Muhammad, tears trickling down his face. He eventually stumbled across his wife, and news came that his eldest daughter was safe. For the next four days, he continued to wade through the devastation in search for his two younger daughters. ""All I could see were dead bodies, swollen like balloons. I left it in the hands of god and I released my two daughters to him,"" says Muhammad. ""Up until today, I have been unable to find the bodies of my two daughters,"" he says. ""My wife is still traumatized and she refuses to go back to our old house, so now we stay in a house that was given to us by an NGO."" Moving on . The past ten years have been difficult for Muhammad and his family. There were many days after the tsunami that he spent just feeling numb. While he was grieving for the loss of his two daughters, he had to return to the devastated school, where he had been principal since 1999. A temporary school was erected in the immediate aftermath, he and his students then began to work with Plan International to design their dream school. Amrullah Amrullah, child protection and participation program adviser for Plan International in Indonesia, was posted as chief of mission for the child rights organization's emergency response at the time. ""When I arrived in Lamnga, they told me this empty area used to be a school and that the local community wanted Plan to rebuild this school<"" he said. ""As a child rights organisation, we wanted to do everything we could to ensure children were able to return to school and to support Muhammad."" ""They wanted their school to be resilient and earthquake-proof, and we tried to incorporate their ideas as much as we could,"" he said. In May 2005, six months after the tsunami, their new school was opened. Returning to school . ""We used to have 207 students here at Lamnga -- when we reopened there were just 115,"" says Muhammad. Instead of diving back into lessons and homework, the school was a place where teachers and students could go to for counseling and support. ""I encouraged the teachers to be spirited. I told them it wasn't necessary to go straight back to the curriculum and that it was OK to read fun stories to them. It took time, but we all slowly got back to normal,"" he says. Megawati, an 18-year-old former student at the school, lived in the hills for five months after the tsunami. She was grateful to return once it was rebuilt. ""I was so happy. To me, school is very important, because without education we do not know anything,"" she said. Life today . Today, the brightly painted Lamnga Elementary School is rich with laughter and activity. Young school children are also taught about the dangers of disasters and regularly participate in evacuation drills. Cahaydi was just two years old when the tsunami tore his village apart. ""I lost my sister,"" he says. ""She was only three. My grandmother was carrying her to safety, but both of them fell and she was unable to keep hold of her."" Now 12, he lives with his mother and father and is a keen student at Lamnga Elementary School. He also knows what to do if an earthquake or tsunami strikes again. ""At school, we are taught about where to evacuate if a disaster strikes and how we can help one another. We have also been taught to hide under a table if an earthquake strikes. I feel better prepared because of these classes and I can also tell my friends what to do,"" he says. The tsunami still haunts him though -- as well as others. ""I am ready, but I cannot imagine another tsunami, as I still feel scared when I think about it,"" says Cahaydi. As for Muhammad, he is proud of the way his school has been rebuilt. He is also flush with pride when he talks about his eldest daughter. Now 25, she is a mother to a little boy and has recently graduated with a Masters degree. While the scars are still there to see, Muhammad, his family and his students, have rebuilt their lives as best they can. The children of Aceh have been given the opportunity to return to a school, designed by them, just for them, so they too can achieve their hopes and dreams.","The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the most devastating natural disasters .

"Florence, Italy (CNN) -- Amanda Knox vowed Friday to fight her conviction for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher ""until the very end"" and said she ""will never go willingly"" back to Italy. Speaking on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Knox said news of the guilty verdict Thursday ""really has hit me like a train."" ""I did not expect this to happen. I really expected so much better from the Italian justice system,"" she said. ""They found me innocent before. How can they say that it's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?"" An appeals court found Knox and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, guilty of murder in the Italian city of Florence after a retrial. Her attorney, Ted Simon, told CNN's ""New Day"" that he had been in touch with Knox and her family all day as they awaited the court's decision. ""It was terrible news,"" he said. ""She understands more than anyone that a wrongful conviction is unjust, not just for the accused but for the victim, their family, as well as society, and she feels this very personally."" Knox's conviction has raised questions about her possible extradition to Italy to serve her 28Â½-year sentence, handed down in absentia, since she has been in the United States throughout the retrial. But Simon said it was too early to talk about extradition since there is still an appeals process to go through, which will probably last another year. Citing privacy and confidentiality issues, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf declined to say whether Italy has requested Knox be extradited. Knox, 26, told ABC she would fight every step of the way. ""I will never go willingly back to the place where I -- I'm gonna fight this until the very end,"" she said. Asked how she was coping with the situation, her attorney highlighted her strength of character. ""While she accepted that very difficult news, she has rebounded. She has shown great resilience and fortitude. And with a great deal of family support, they're going to go forward and appeal what we would characterize as a completely unjust conviction,"" Simon said. The attorney argued there was ""no evidence"" implicating his client in the murder and never had been, adding that it was ""incomprehensible"" that the court had found her guilty. Sollecito stopped near border . Earlier Friday, Italian authorities stopped Sollecito near the border with Austria and Slovenia, Italian police told CNN. Sollecito, who is not allowed to leave Italy while the legal process continues, was halted in the northern Italian town of Udine, police said. The Slovenian border is less than 20 miles east of Udine, and the border with Austria lies about 55 miles to the north. Sollecito's lawyer, Luca Maori, said his client was indeed in Udine with his girlfriend. They were driving to the town of Treviso, where his girlfriend lives, and because of the snow had to stop, the lawyer said. Maori told CNN it was not Sollecito's intent to flee the country. Prosecutors said the couple killed Kercher, a British student, in November 2007. Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Both denied murder. Kercher, 21, was found partially nude in a pool of blood in the house she shared with Knox in the picturesque town of Perugia, where both women were exchange students. But despite years of courtroom battles over her death, many aspects of the crime still remain unexplained. 'Journey to the truth' On Friday morning, Kercher's siblings spoke in Florence about their family's long ordeal. Her sister, Stephanie Kercher, said the family might never know exactly what happened on the night of her death. ""I think we are still on the journey to the truth,"" she said. ""I think it may be the fact that we don't ever really know what happened that night, which is obviously something we will have to come to terms with."" Lyle Kercher, Meredith's brother, said the family may have to wait until spring 2015 for a final resolution, since the verdicts reached Thursday can still be appealed at Italy's Supreme Court. ""Nothing is going to bring Meredith back, nothing will take away the horror of what happened to her,"" he said. ""The best we can hope for is finally bringing this whole case to a conclusion, having a conviction, and everyone can move on with their lives."" If the Supreme Court upholds the murder conviction, he expects to see Italian authorities make an extradition request to the United States so that Knox serves her sentence in Italy, he said. Stephanie Kercher said that she had been told of a letter written by Knox to the Kercher family but that she had not seen it. She also appeared to rule out meeting with Knox in the future, despite the American's overtures to the family and whatever the final outcome of the case. ""We've asked to have our wishes respected in that we would like to be together as a family to remember Meredith,"" she said. ""A lot has happened over this length of time. It would be very difficult to meet someone having had all that happen."" Read more: Six things to know about Amanda Knox retrial verdict . Pair first convicted in 2009 . Knox and Sollecito were first convicted in 2009, but those charges were overturned on appeal in 2011 and the pair were freed, having spent four years in prison. In March of last year, Italy's Supreme Court overturned the pair's acquittals, leading to the retrial that resulted Thursday night in their convictions for murder being reinstated by a Florence appeals court. Knox, who remained at home in Seattle, Washington, while the retrial was held, said in a written statement Thursday that her conviction would bring no consolation to the Kercher family.

"(CNN) -- Hey Star Trek fans, how much do you know about Capt. James Kirk? Were you aware that he was born in Bethesda, Maryland, and raised in Hershey, Pennsylvania? That he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy? Doesn't sound familiar? We're talking about the real James Kirk, who, like the fictional Star Trek character James T. Kirk, commands a ship of the most cutting-edge technology. Shields up! Scientists work to produce 'Star Trek' deflector device . Capt. James A. Kirk will be commander of the Navy's new USS Zumwalt, the first of the DDG-1000 class of destroyers. It is longer, faster and carries state-of-the-art weapons that will allow it to destroy targets at more than 60 miles away, according to the Navy. Much of the ship's superstructure is wrapped in a huge canopy made of lightweight carbon fiber composite. Navy owes $1.5 million for damage to reef, Philippines says . The Zumwalt can't travel into deep space like the Starship Enterprise, but it does have a feature that the fictional Capt. Kirk coveted. On the television series, the captain once stole a ""cloaking device"" from a Romulan ship that effectively made the Enterprise ""disappear"" from their enemies' eyes. While the Zumwalt cannot completely disappear, its canopy and the rest of the ship is built on angles that help make it 50 times harder to spot on radar than an ordinary destroyer. When its begins missions, the Zumwalt will be the largest stealth ship in the Navy. This man cost the Navy a submarine . CNN's Larry Shaughnessy and Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","Capt.

"(CNN) -- In the midst of heated political campaigns and real wars abroad, it is noteworthy that two columnists writing for the most consequential newspaper in the world, The New York Times, took a different tack on Sunday and ended up in the same place: A discussion of sexual nihilism and the modern woman. They are on to something. Maureen Dowd's column, titled ""She's Fit to Be Tied,"" looks at E.L James's ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" a trilogy of erotic, bondage-themed fiction. Dowd expressed surprise over the popularity of the books in which a 21-year-old innocent girl becomes a sexual ""submissive"" of a rich, powerful 27-year-old businessman. While we're steeped in a so-called ""war on women,"" Dowd wonders ""why women are thronging to the story of an innocent who jumps into the arms of a Seattle sadist with a 'Red Room of Pain' full of chains, clamps, whips, canes, flogs and cuffs, falling in love to the soundtrack of the Police's 'King of Pain.'"" Dowd cites the remarkable success of the trilogy among Generation X women -- the contemporaries, allies and beneficiaries of the modern feminist movement. And yet, the narrative flies in the face of women's progress. For example, a contract that the girl signs with the man stipulates that ""the Dominant may flog, spank, whip or corporally punish the Submissive as he sees fit, for purposes of discipline, for his own personal enjoyment or for any other reason, which he is not obliged to provide."" If this is progress for women, what would regression look like? Dowd's colleague, Frank Bruni, reflected on a similar subject in his column, ""The Bleaker Sex,"" on Lena Dunham's new HBO series ""Girls."" In this unglamorous, dull version of ""Sex in the City,"" Dunham stars as a contemporary, twenty-something woman playing second fiddle to the bizarre, dominating sexual fantasies of her boyfriend. Her first sex scene opens with her back to her boyfriend, inertly and joylessly submitting to his commands. Bruni recoils at the idea of this. He writes, ""You watch these scenes and other examples of the zeitgeist-y, early-20s heroines of 'Girls' engaging in, recoiling from, mulling and mourning sex, and you think: Gloria Steinem went to the barricades for this?"" Bruni goes on to grapple with Dunham's loveless sex scenes and wonders whether today's onslaught of pornography and easy sex has desensitized men to the point where they view women, to recall the words of an earlier day, only as objects. Even the act of sex itself is boring to some men unless it is ratcheted up in some strange, deviant fashion -- all at the expense of the thoroughly humiliated and debased woman. In the act of degrading women, men are also degrading themselves. And the voyeurism, inspired by such entertainment, debases men and women even more. This is a parlous, dreadful outcome for both sexes. (As I have written previously, men in our time, particularly young men, are having trouble in many ways.) As Bruni asked: Is this what feminism fought for? In the 1970s we were told to respect women, treat them as more than sexual objects and treat their humanity the same as ours. Is any of this still true today? The insightful Hanna Rosin, author of the forthcoming book, ""The End of Men,"" wrote in The Wall Street Journal recently, ""Studies do indeed show that women are no more happy than they were in the 1970s."" Wharton School economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers confirmed this in a 2009 study that argues women's happiness appeared to be in decline despite advances in education and the workforce. Well, how could women be happy with what is described in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" and ""Girls""? Take note that this disheartening and dismal tableau of modern liberated sex comes not from pro-family conservatives, who have been condemning this turn in our culture for some time, but from two stars of the liberal commentariat. Dowd and Bruni leave us wondering the same thing Peggy Lee did a generation ago in her song, ""Is That All There Is?"" Is there no alternative to the ""Red Room of Pain"" and Dunham's demoralizing sexual encounters? Yes, there is. Consider one of the most well regarded writers of the Victorian era, Mary Ann Evans, better known to us by her pen name, George Eliot. In her novel, ""Daniel Deronda,"" she says of love, ""For what is love itself, for the one we love best? -- an enfolding of immeasurable cares which yet are better than any joys outside our love."" In an enfoldment of immeasurable cares in a real and true love, there is immeasurable intimacy too, including a richly satisfying sexual intimacy that finds no equal or parallel in a callous and casual hookup culture. It is worth pointing out that this desideratum -- deep sexual satisfaction -- is found most often, as has been empirically verified over and over again, in what is often called, derisively, traditional marriage. Given the possibilities and fantasies presented in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" or ""Girls,"" some of which have been so graphically laid out and laid bare in our oversaturated TV and Internet culture, can it not be argued that what Eliot described is the option most worth considering again, at least once everything else has been tried and found so painfully wanting? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: An erotic trilogy and a HBO series paint discouraging portraits of women .

"(CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday issued a sharp warning to ISIS militants, saying after the United States is done grieving the death of two American journalists, their killers will have to answer for their actions. ""They should know we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice,"" he forcefully told an audience at an event on the New Hampshire-Maine border. ""Because hell is where they will reside. Hell is where they will reside."" Biden opened his remarks in memory of Steven Sotloff, the journalist who was beheaded by ISIS militants Tuesday, two weeks after James Foley was executed in the same horrific manner on video. Foley was from New Hampshire, while Sotloff lived there for boarding school. ISIS video shows beheading of American journalist . Describing the perpetrators as ""barbarians,"" Biden vowed that Americans would not be frightened or intimidated by the heinous acts. ""We came back after 9/11. We dusted ourselves off and we made sure that Osama bin Laden would never, ever again threaten the American people,"" Biden said. ""We came back Boston strong, blaming no one but resolve to be certain that this didn't happen again."" ""As a nation, we're united, and when people harm Americans, we don't retreat,"" he later said. ""We don't forget."" ISIS executions heighten fears for Western hostages . The vice president, who's mulling a 2016 presidential bid, made his remarks at the Portsmouth Naval Yard in a speech about the economy. He was accompanied on stage by U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who's running for re-election this year. Previewing Biden's trip, the campaign for former Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who's challenging Shaheen for her seat in this year's midterms, released a Web video that shows footage of the vice president supporting President Barack Obama's foreign policy, an agenda the Brown campaign labels a ""failure."" 'Degrade and destroy' After Sotloff's killing, Obama faced a chorus of bipartisan calls from Congress to act more aggressively and come up with a concrete strategy to combat ISIS, beyond the already ongoing targeted air strikes. Speaking Wednesday, Obama addressed his much criticized statement last week that he has no strategy on ISIS. He said he was referring to a military strategy in Syria that ""might"" require congressional approval. ""Our objective is clear. That is to degrade and destroy (ISIS) so it's no longer a threat,"" he said. ""We can accomplish that. It's going to take some time, it's going to take some effort."" Obama: U.S. won't back down to ISIS . The president said the world needs a regional strategy to defeat the group. ""We've been putting together a strategy that was designed to do a number of things... What we have to make sure is we have a regional strategy in place,"" he said.","Of the U.S. journalists' killers, vice president says, ""We will follow them to the gates of hell""

"(CNN) -- If you're dreaming of a white Christmas -- much like the one Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen used to know at the Columbia Inn in Pine Tree, Vermont -- the humbug of the matter is: Neither the inn nor the town exist. You better not pout, though. There are still a few of the season's favorite film locales that you can visit in real life: . The Parker family's house in ""A Christmas Story"" If you find yourself in the vicinity of Cleveland and a fanatic of the 1983 cult holiday classic ""A Christmas Story,"" make a pit stop at the Parker family's house, which is open for public tours complete with a museum and gift shop directly across the street. If fawning over the ""I-can't-put-my-arms-down"" snowsuit and the ""Oh fuuuuuudge!"" family Oldsmobile isn't quite enough movie magic, visitors can buy leg lamps at the gift shop for their very own ""soft glow of electric sex gleaming in the window."" Or if you're feeling extra rebellious, Red Ryder, carbine action, 200-shot range model air rifles are also available. Bedford Falls from ""It's a Wonderful Life"" The town of Bedford Falls in the 1946 classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"" may have been fictional and created on soundstages for filming in Encino, California, but the folks in Seneca Falls, New York, claim their tiny mill town was director Frank Capra's inspiration for the cinematic community. (He is believed to have visited the town in 1945.) Visitors are encouraged to celebrate the film's ties each December by taking part in a movie-themed walking tour and judging the similarities for themselves. Stand on the steel Bridge Street Bridge, similar to the one that Jimmy Stewart's character, George Bailey, leapt from in the movie to ""save"" his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody, or stroll down the streetlamp-lined main street.

The McCallister residence from ""Home Alone"" While you can't go through all Buzz's private stuff (or inside the house for that matter, unless you're in the market for a new home), you can do a drive-by like your favorite Wet Bandits, Harry and Marv, of the McCallister residence approximately 15 miles north of downtown Chicago in the Winnetka suburb. The home, built in the 1920s, is listed for sale at $1,950,000, and still features the recognizable staircase just inside the front door in case indoor sledding is one of your favorite pastimes. Serendipity restaurant from ""Serendipity"" Part holiday movie, part romantic comedy, this 2001 film starring John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale opens during the peak of the holiday shopping rush with the then-strangers attempting to buy the last pair of black cashmere gloves at Bloomingdale's. After initial sparks, the smitten characters, both in relationships, spend the rest of the evening together in New York. The title of the movie itself is equal parts definition of serendipity -- Merriam-Webster lists it as ""the faculty or phenomenon of finding valuable or agreeable things not sought for"" -- and the New York restaurant where the two fated lovers partake in frozen hot chocolate and eventually part ways (only to be reunited by a series of fortunate accidents by the end of the film). If you've got a sweet tooth and an even sweeter romantic side, the cafe, Serendipity 3, is open until midnight Sunday through Thursday, 1 a.m. on Fridays and 2 a.m. on Saturdays.

Macy's from ""Miracle on 34th Street"" The actual miracle on 34th Street in the 1947 movie, as well as the 1994 remake, takes place at 151 West 34th Street to be exact, Macy's flagship store in New York's Herald Square. Since 1924, the department store kicks off the Christmas shopping season with its annual Thanksgiving Day Parade, culminating with the arrival of Santa Claus at the parade's finale. After the parade and until Christmas Eve, children can visit the ""nice man with the white beard"" like Susan Walker and tell Santa what they'd like for Christmas. If you can't make it to New York, every Macy's across the country has a letterbox for stamped letters to the North Pole.

"(CNN) -- Deidre Robinson's cheeks flushed as two ride attendants tried to push her safety guard into the lock position. At 310 pounds, Robinson knew she'd have restrictions at the theme park, but that didn't make her feel any less humiliated when she was told she couldn't ride the roller coaster with her daughter. ""There was a big guy next to me and his snapped,"" she said. ""I thought, 'There's something wrong with that.' Obviously I was a lot bigger than he was."" The 2007 event was one of several turning points for Robinson, now 31, who was eventually inspired to join Weight Watchers and start doing Zumba, a Latin-inspired dance fitness class, in February 2009. Less than two years later, the South Carolina native had dropped more than half her body weight -- going from a size 24 to a size 2 -- and was ready turn her healthy lifestyle into her livelihood. Childhood scars . ""My mom always called me thick,"" Robinson said. ""Back in the fourth grade, I remember my mom measuring my cereal ... three-fourths a cup of Cheerios."" Nobody in her family had ever battled weight problems, she said. They couldn't understand why she gained weight while eating the same things as her sister, who ""to this day is just genetically thin."" By high school, she had tried just about every diet out there: from eating only chicken and rice every day for a month to ""the no-carb thing."" The quick results were nice, she said, but nothing ever stuck. Weight loss helps mom battle cancer . Things didn't get any easier after graduation. Robinson's parents and sister, who she said she's very close with, tricked her into attending a weight intervention under the false pretense of discussing a bill. She showed up with her boyfriend at the time, who wasn't overweight. A few years ago, they tried again, giving Robinson a gym membership for Christmas. ""For my family to come at me like that ... they didn't intentionally try to hurt my feelings, but they were trying to wake me up,"" Robinson said. ""They didn't know what it was like. They never had weight problems. They ate the same food (as me). They're the ones who took me to the restaurants."" Robinson said her family's well-meaning gestures did nothing to motivate her to lose weight. Rather, they made her defensive and caused tension. Robinson's dad wasn't overtly hard on her, but she could tell he was disappointed -- ""like he thought I let myself go,"" she said, which might have been unfair considering he had his own vice. Just as Robinson considered eating a habit that she had little control over, her dad had smoked cigarettes since he was 20. He died at 45 in 2004 from coronary artery disease, five years before Robinson lost the weight. ""The one thing I hate the most is that my dad never got to see (me thin),"" she said. ""I know how proud he'd be that I got that weight off. He was always so proud of me for my job accomplishments, but he could never understand why I couldn't get that part right."" Family wins $10K after losing 255 pounds . The tipping point . From what she could wear and drive to where she would sit at restaurants, Robinson's size dictated many aspects of her daily life. ""I didn't have one pair of shoes that had laces,"" she said. ""It put me out of breath to tie them. ... I would go into a restaurant already determining in my head whether I'd need a table or booth. I couldn't drive a sports car. I literally couldn't fit behind the wheel."" And the theme park incident is just one bad memory of a too-snug safety belt. Robinson hadn't been on an airplane in about five years when she jetted off to Miami for a work trip with her husband in 2005. She cringed as a flight attendant yelled out for someone to bring a seat belt extension over. ""In that situation, you almost feel like ... yes, you are a human being, but not only do you not fit into society because you look different and you stand out, but you literally do not fit,"" she said. ""I wouldn't even go to a concert because the seats (were) too small. You don't want to put yourself in those situations because they're so embarrassing."" Robinson said her daughter McKenzie, who turns 10 in November, is the main reason she ultimately decided to get fit. Up until McKenzie was 6, Robinson hadn't been in a pool with her because she didn't feel comfortable in a bathing suit. ""She started asking me, 'Mom, why are you not swimming with me?' "" And as parents slid down the giant slide at the carnival with their children, Robinson waited for her daughter at the bottom. ""Why won't you go down with me?"" McKenzie would ask her mom. ""I felt like I was missing out,"" Robinson said. ""I was there. I would take her to the events, but I couldn't participate. I'm at all the events, but I'm in none of the pictures."" Shake it . Thanks to Weight Watchers and Zumba DVDs, the weight started to fall off, Robinson said. After losing 30 pounds and gaining confidence, she began taking Zumba classes at a gym. She started going a few times a week and loved it so much she continued to go every day. More than 150 pounds later, Robinson decided to open her own fitness studio in Greenville, South Carolina. Within two months of opening Fitness Shakers in May 2011, Robinson said she quickly lost another 15 pounds -- bringing her total weight loss to 170 pounds in two years -- just from being the only instructor at the time. ""It's amazing to think I used to have these huge round chubby thick arms and now I've got this muscle definition,"" she said. ""Pounds don't even bother me anymore. Now it's body fat percentage."" FDA: Dietary supplements dangerous . Her studio, as well as her story, now helps inspire others to be active and healthy, if the testimonials on her website are any indication: ""I could never thank Dee Dee Robinson and her team enough for all they have done for me through Fitness Shakers,"" Jessie E. writes. ""I immediately felt love, support, and acceptance walking into my first class."" ""They trust me because they know where I've been,"" Robinson said of the members at her gym. ""They know I can relate."" She now has a staff of 10 and a second location in Taylor, South Carolina, which opened in November 2011. ""I work out every day of my life,"" Robinson said, who also credits her fit physique to knowing what foods to eat. Salmon is one of her favorites because it's filling, yet low on the Weight Watchers' PointsPlus system. ""Do I have my one cheat day a week? Yeah,"" she said. ""Is one cheeseburger going to make me gain weight? No."" Robinson has also noticed some other positive changes in her life since losing the weight. In addition to strengthening the bond she has with herself -- gaining confidence and happiness -- she said her relationship with her family has flourished. ""They say, 'We finally got our Dee back. Her personality is back. She's her bubbly normal self,' "" Robinson said. ""We're definitely closer."" She said she used to remove herself from situations, such as family cookouts, because she wasn't comfortable with her size, but now she's a lot more involved. ""I did it for me,"" Robinson said of losing the weight. ""But maybe this whole weight loss process wasn't just for me. Never did I think I could inspire others. ... I get more gratitude from that than just knowing what I've done for myself."" Have you lost weight?

"Baton Rouge, Louisiana (CNN) -- It's Sunday morning at the New Life Baptist Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, but the man preaching to the choir is no minister. ""My God is not finished with me yet,"" he tells the congregation. The man speaking is Edwin W. Edwards -- ex-four-term Louisiana governor, ex-four-term congressman and ex-con. ""I may be old and rancid butter, but I'm on your side of the bread,"" he proclaims from the altar. Unrepentant and unapologetic, Edwards is in church not looking for forgiveness. The 87-year-old is looking for votes. After almost nine years in prison, the flamboyant showman of Louisiana politics has a fresh act -- running for Congress -- co-starring his 35-year-old wife, Trina, and their 1-year-old baby. This is his third marriage. Ex-governor, convict Edwin Edwards to run for Congress . Fifty years after his first stint on Capitol Hill, Edwards would no doubt rather be running for governor again. But he's running for a seat in Congress because Louisiana law doesn't allow felons to run for state office -- until they've been out of prison for 15 years. By then, Edwards would be 98 -- so he's taking this shot instead. Former Louisiana governor released from prison . His chances? The district is now bright red, but never mind. Political experts think Edwards at least has a good shot of making it into a runoff because of his universal name recognition and the size of the field: he's running against nine Republicans, two other Democrats and one Libertarian. If no candidate gets 50% in November, the top two then will face off in December. ""He is gonna make the runoff hands-down unless some kinda Christmas morning miracle happens and pushes him out,"" says Jeremy Alford, publisher of LaPolitics.com. Edwards won the backing of state Democrats last week. While Edwards was happy to re-enter the political arena, his wife of four years wasn't fully on board. Did she want him to run? ""Not particularly. I would naturally support him in whatever he chose to do,"" Trina Edwards says. ""But it's not really my thing."" Edwards' relationship with Trina began as his prison pen pal, which led to love at first sight when she visited him. ""I was expecting him to be angry or bitter, and he just wasn't,"" she tells us. As for Edwards he recounts what she told him when they met. Edwards: Never profited from taxpayers . ""She said, 'If you don't mind, I only live 30 minutes from here. I'd like to come back and visit you.' That's like throwin' a rubber raft to a drowning man."" He went to prison in 2002 after a felony conviction of extorting millions in exchange for riverboat casino licenses -- and served his time. To this day, Edwards says he never took a dime from the taxpayers. ""In all this claptrap about how crooked I am and what I stole, nobody's ever charged me, or accused me, of taking money from the taxpayers,"" he tells CNN. ""It had nothin' to do with my career as a public official. Nothin."" Former Louisiana Gov. Edwards gets 10 years in corruption case . After getting free in January 2011, he and Trina married. Last year they had a son. So now Edwards is the father to children in their 60s, a wife half their age and a baby. ""He gets up with him in the morning,"" Trina Edwards says. ""He changed diapers. He bathes him, He puts his clothes on. He feeds him."" If this seems like a reality TV show it was -- briefly -- entitled ""The Governor's Wife"" on the A&E network. What was it like for them doing it? ""It's horrible,"" she says. His take: ""it was unbelievable."" The couple now says the whole thing was kind of annoying. The critics and viewers agreed. They admit they are bit of an odd couple -- and it's not just age. Trina is a Republican. Edwards is an old-time populist Democrat who wants to return to Congress exactly 50 years since his first stint there. When the 6th District congressional seat became open, he says he thought, ""That's my chance. I've got a second chance, and I'm going to take it. And I'm gonna surprise everyone."" As for what he would say to those who ask about sending a convicted felon to Washington, ""People say, well, they're all crooks anyhow. You might as well send an experienced one.""

"(CNN) -- Despite the many questions surrounding a reported altercation between Solange Knowles and her brother-in-law Jay Z, you wouldn't know it based on how the rapper and his wife Beyonce are acting. A recent surveillance video which appears to show the singer, fashionista and younger sister of Beyonce attacking the ""Magna Carta Holy Grail"" rapper has not only sparked an avalanche of memes, but also much speculation as to what led to the alleged incident, initially reported by TMZ, in the first place. So far none of the trio are speaking about it directly. Monday night, Beyonce and Jay Z appeared together courtside -- as they often do -- at a Nets game. The rapper formerly had a minority ownership stake in the team. Following the alleged incident, Beyonce posted a prayer on her official Instagram account. ""Help me to choose my friends wisely so I won't be led astray,"" it says. ""Give me discernment and strength to separate myself from anyone who is not a good influence."" For her part, Solange Knowles has reportedly deleted a picture of her sister from the night of the Met Gala from her Instagram account. And you thought your family had issues. As crisis communications expert Howard Bragman told CNN, ""Jay Z and Beyonce have all the money and power in the world, and they couldn't keep it under wraps apparently. So that tells you."" Not that it's easy for such public figures, he added. ""How do you keep it under wraps? You go in your private limo with a chauffeur that's signed a nondisclosure agreement, you go to a private home behind gates, you never go out in public,"" Bragman said. ""Once you step out of that cocoon, you're fair game, and there are paparazzi and media that have a price on your head like a hunted animal."" The younger Knowles, 27, grew up in the spotlight also, though it was a bit dimmer than the one on her famous sister. As a young teen, Solange Knowles danced backup for her sister's former group Destiny's Child, and at the age of 16 released her debut album, ""Solo Star."" Knowles told Harper's Bazaar in a recent interview that despite her now-divorced parents' being a driving force in Beyonce's career, they were more cautious when it came to her. ""My parents constantly tried to talk me out of being an artist,"" Solange said. ""They had gone through the whole journey with my sister and just wanted me to have a normal teenage life."" That didn't quite pan out, as the aspiring artist got pregnant at the age of 17 and soon married her son's father. They divorced a few years later. Knowles has been quoted as saying her family was instrumental in helping her survive the rigors of being a young single mother and that she and Beyonce have an especially tight bond. ""It definitely was tough, having your sister have a built-in BFF (Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland, who lived with the Knowles family when she was younger) and me being five years younger,"" Solange told the London Evening Standard. ""But my sister was very protective of me, and we were very sweet with each other. I'm sure if we were closer in age we wouldn't have gotten along so great. But we've been super-close ever since I was about 13."" So close that Knowles has written hit songs for her sister, including ""Upgrade U."" But despite the pair's shared love of music and fashion, Beyonce told the New York Times in 2012 that there was one area her younger sister refused to bend on. ""My sister will not record with me,"" the elder Knowles said. ""She's her own woman."" So much so that Buzzfeed has rounded up some of Solange Knowles' most outspoken moments, including the time she snapped at a TV interviewer, ""I have to say, that was not a very professional introduction before. Please don't tie me into family and my brother-in-law's establishment."" According to Us Weekly, such behavior as what allegedly happened inside The Standard Hotel elevator is nothing new for Beyonce and Jay Z. The magazine quotes an anonymous source as saying, ""Solange has flipped her lid like that before."" People magazine quoted an unnamed source as saying Solange was ""provoked"" prior to the alleged incident.

"(CNN) -- To Sam McNair, a 17-year-old high school senior in Duluth, Georgia, it was an innocent hug. ""You never know what someone's going through,"" McNair told CNN affiliate WGCL in Atlanta. ""A hug might help."" It didn't in this case because after McNair hugged a teacher, he ended up with a year-long suspension from Duluth High School, putting his college plans in jeopardy. ""He's a senior; he plays football. He was getting ready for lacrosse season, and you are stripping him of the opportunity to even get a full scholarship for athletics for college,"" April McNair, Sam's mother, told WGCL. The elder McNair, who says she and her son call themselves huggers, said she was dumbfounded to learn of her son's suspension after hugging a teacher. Surveillance video captures the hug in question, showing Sam placing his arms around the teacher and giving her a hug. The teacher then pushes him away. According to a discipline report obtained by WGCL, the teacher said Sam's lips and cheeks touched her neck and that she had warned Sam about hugging in the past. Asked if he kissed the teacher, Sam told the television reporter he did not. He said he has hugged teachers many times before, including this teacher, and has never been warned. In a statement, Sloan Roach, a spokesperson for the Gwinnett County Public Schools, told CNN, ""Hearing officers consider witness testimony, a review of the known facts, and a student's past disciplinary history -- including long-term suspensions that result in alternative school placement -- when determining consequences."" ""If a parent has concerns about the outcome of a panel, he or she is entitled to appeal the decision to the Gwinnett County Board of Education,"" Roach added. Since this is a discipline issue, the law prohibits the district from sharing details about the student's situation or the student's past discipline history, said the spokesperson. Sam told WGCL he does have a discipline record and previous suspensions but not for sexual harassment. ""I have five months left in my senior year. I don't see why they would take that away from me,"" said Sam. His mother plans to appeal the school board's decision and said the school should have notified her if there were any problems with his hugging before suspending him and threatening his college future. On her Facebook page, she posted a Change.org petition, calling for the school district to ""revisit a year-long suspension for hugging a teacher."" The petition had more than 200 signatures as of Monday evening. Reaction online has been mixed, with many believing the punishment might be severe but raising questions about Sam's prior history. ""Our zero tolerance is taken a bit too far, but I have to reserve my comments since I am curious what his 'previous records' of suspension were about, as well as his disciplinary record,"" said Sue Scheff, a parenting advocate. ""But I don't think hugging constitutes sexual harassment unless he has intent otherwise and it doesn't seem that way,"" said Scheff. Some commenters said the allegation that the teacher raised the issue before with Sam was a key point. ""If she has warned him before and he did it again and his hand or face touches her where she believes it's inappropriate, like (the) neck or breast, it's textbook sexual harassment,"" said a viewer on WGCL's website. But said another commenter, ""This is crazy. Now we can't hug people anymore. What in the world?"" ""Something so, so innocent can be perceived as something totally opposite,"" said Sam.

"(CNN) -- Online classified service Craigslist's decision to censor its adult services section could be a model for other websites, a leader in the fight against prostitution ads said Saturday. ""This step is very much in the right direction,"" said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who spearheaded a letter from 17 attorneys general who recently banded together to urge Craigslist to discontinue its adult services section. The embattled website has been under fire for allegations that it promotes prostitution. ""These prostitution ads enable human trafficking and assaults on women,"" said Blumenthal. ""They are flagrant and rampant. Craigslist has lacked the wherewithal or will to effectively screen them out."" The section that usually reads ""adult services"" on Craigslist was replaced by the word ""censored."" It was not immediately clear whether Craigslist removed the adult services and replaced them with the ""censored"" section, which had a link that was not active. But for users who accessed the account outside the U.S., the erotic services link was still active. Craigslist representatives told CNN on Saturday that they will release a statement at a later time. ""The message here is put people over profits,"" said Blumenthal, who is running for the U.S. Senate from Connecticut as a Democrat. He said officials will continue monitoring Craigslist and other websites for such content. ""The increasingly sharp public criticism of Craigslist's Adult Services section reflects a growing recognition that ads for prostitution -- including ads trafficking children -- are rampant on it,"" the attorneys general had said in an Aug. 24 letter to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster and Founder Craig Newmark. A Craigslist spokeswoman said at the time that the site agreed with at least some of the letter. ""We strongly support the attorneys general desire to end trafficking in children and women, through the Internet or by any other means,"" said Susan MacTavish Best, who handles press inquiries for Craigslist. ""We hope to work closely with them, as we are with experts at nonprofits and in law enforcement, to prevent misuse of our site in facilitation of trafficking, and to combat such crimes wherever they appear, online or offline."" In their letter, the attorneys general highlighted an open letter, which appeared as a Washington Post ad, in which two girls said they were sold for sex on Craigslist. When the ad came out, Buckmaster wrote a blog post in response that said, ""Craigslist is anxious to know that the perpetrators in these girls' cases are behind bars."" The letter also highlighted a report in May by CNN's Amber Lyon, who posted a fake ad for a girl's services in the adult section. She received 15 calls soliciting sex in three hours. Earlier this month, Lyon interviewed a woman named ""Jessica"" who sells sex on Craigslist. The woman said a Craigslist ad was ""the fastest, quickest way you're for sure going to see somebody that day."" In a later blog post, Buckmaster said Craigslist implemented manual screening of adult services ads in May 2009. ""Since that time, before being posted each individual ad is reviewed by an attorney,"" the post said. He said the attorneys are trained to enforce Craigslist's posting guidelines, ""which are stricter than those typically used by yellow pages, newspapers, or any other company that we are aware of."" Attorneys general from Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia made the request a week after accused ""Craigslist killer"" Philip Markoff committed suicide in jail. Markoff was charged with the April 2009 killing of Julissa Brisman. Boston Police said that Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, and Markoff might have met her through the website. In 2008, under pressure from state prosecutors, the website raised the fees for posting adult services ads. In 2009, it started donating portions of the money generated by adult ads to charity. A CNN investigation of Craigslist's adult services section, which replaced ""erotic services ads"" two years ago, counted more than 7,000 ads in a single day. Many offered thinly veiled ""services"" for anything from $50 for a half-hour to $400 an hour. CNN's Deborah Doft and Nicky Robertson contributed to this report.","Connecticut attorney general praises action .

"(CNN) -- The University of Oklahoma in Norman briefly shut down Wednesday after a report of a possible shooting that apparently turned out to be a false alarm, the university's president said. ""At this time, there is no evidence that shots were fired. Classes are going on as normal in all other buildings except Gould Hall,"" President David Boren said Wednesday afternoon. ""Additional search of Gould Hall being conducted just in case. It appears to have been a false alarm."" Earlier Wednesday, no evidence had been found of any shots being fired, and no injuries had been reported, school spokeswoman Catherine Bishop said. After telling students to take shelter for more than 30 minutes, the school later announced that normal campus operations had resumed -- except at Gould Hall, the site of the reported shooting, ""where additional checking is continuing,"" the school tweeted. Gould Hall houses the university's College of Architecture. Both the Norman and campus police responded quickly as did emergency personnel, the school tweeted. Boren told students the incident may have been a false alarm caused by a machinery backfire, independent student newspaper The Oklahoma Daily reported on Twitter. Maj. Bruce Chan of campus police told CNN there was a report of shots fired in the Gould Hall area of campus. The incident took place at around 11:20 a.m. local time (12:20 p.m. ET) while classes were in session. Students and faculty were alerted via text.

"(CNN) -- Everyone wants answers. And, for some strange reason, they think Ethan has them. Ethan, in this case, is the creator of the TextEthan app. Ethan, who told CNN via email he doesn't want his full name used out of privacy concerns, says he originally wrote the eponymous app as a way for his friends to get in touch with him. It was a simple, novel idea that spiraled into something much bigger and more bizarre than that. His friends started turning other friends onto it, then their friends found out and so on. It's gotten so popular that Ethan says the app gets more than one download per minute. He says his first email from someone he genuinely didn't know was from an anonymous girl saying she was a ""princess from Pandora."" They had a fantastical exchange about dwarves and love, and it signified to Ethan the moment when the app had truly gotten out in the wild. ""I thought there was something magical about the whole crazy conversation I had with a random person,"" he said. Turns out, people liked the idea of silly, light-hearted conversations with a seemingly nice stranger. Ethan doesn't mind answering, and enjoyed chatting up these strangers, so he released TextEthan to the public. However, Ethan decided some ground rules were in order, which include: . -Ethan can't respond when he's asleep . -No emergency messages . -Don't ask Ethan to do your work . -Don't fall in love with Ethan . Now, people Ethan has never met are depending on him to help them address the minor conundrums of life: this dress or that one? Italian or Chinese? Stay home or work out? Due to the attention, some people have even started pushing Ethan to see if he could build them their own app. It's possibly the next step in social software: from everyone on the same app to everyone with his or her own app. As for Ethan, he recently crossed a new threshold: he'd been answering every question but finally succumbed to sleep and couldn't get to them all. Which may have led to another rule for users of the app: ""Be patient. He'll respond eventually.""","TextEthan began as a way for Ethan to stay in touch with friends .

"(CNN) -- A North Carolina man has been charged with murdering a pregnant Fort Bragg soldier, police said Tuesday. Fayetteville detectives arrested Edgar Patino, a fellow soldier, at his home in Hope Mills, North Carolina, about 15 miles south of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He is accused of killing Spc. Megan Lynn Touma, 23, found dead on June 21 in a hotel near Fort Bragg. She was seven-months pregnant at the time of her death, authorities said. Touma, a five-year veteran of the Army, had served with the U.S. Army Dental Activity Clinic in Bamberg, Germany, and in Fort Drum, New York, before her stint at Fort Bragg. Two of Touma's friends told CNN that Touma and Patino had been stationed together in Germany and dated in the past. Touma's friends said Patino proposed to her in Germany before Touma learned, on her return to North Carolina, that Patino was still married. The two friends, female soldiers who said they were stationed with Touma in Germany, asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the case. Touma is is the second female soldier from Fort Bragg to die under suspicious circumstances since June. Army 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc was killed in early July. Her Fayetteville, North Carolina, apartment was torched July 10 and her charred body was found nearby a few days later. Her husband, Marine Cpl. John Wimunc was charged with arson and first degree murder in connection with the death. Another Marine, Lance Cpl. Kyle Alden, was charged with arson and felony accessory after the fact to first-degree murder.

"(CNN) -- History has its holy wars. Economic wars. Civil wars. World wars. Six-Day War. Hundred Years' War. The latter a toddler on the line of time compared with the Christmas war. Almost 1,700 years -- and counting -- on when, and how, to celebrate Christmas. If, at all. We're not talking the Grinch here. Stealing Christmas. No, no, no. Obliteration. Elimination. Eradication. In the early centuries of Christianity's existence, there was no consensus on the date of Jesus' birth, or even on whether the day, whatever it was, should be celebrated as a holiday. Elesha Coffman, writing in Christianity Today, notes that early Christians contended that the date was, variously, May 20, April 18, April 19, May 28, January 2, November 17, November 20, March 12 and March 25 -- and that December 25 probably didn't emerge as the favored date until late in the third century. That, intentionally or not, grafted the new Christmas onto the old Saturnalia, the most popular celebration of Roman times. The seven-day festival that started December 17 to honor the god Saturn and welcome the winter solstice gave us today's tradition of holiday greenery, gift giving and the office party (or variations thereof), for the Saturnalia was a time of much drinking, some carousing, certainly unrestrained revelry. The yin and yang of that has come down to us through the centuries and can be seen today in the battles over the commercialization of Christmas, the popularity of yuletide parties, too many martinis oiling the voices raised in song. A little too much ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" and not enough ""O Holy Night."" Having enjoyed wonderfully merry and happy Christmases through the years, as I was growing up and making my way in the world, I took those concerns in stride and kept ""Ho! Ho! Ho!"" at the ready. Then, in my early 40s, when I was living in New England, while leafing through a book as part of my research for a story, I hit the subtopic: Christmas Under the Ban. Because it happened to be facing a page with an old-fashioned illustration of a little girl standing under a living room archway trimmed with greenery, I thought the rope of greens was the ban. Not so. Complaints about how to celebrate Christmas had started early, threaded through the Dark Ages, the Middle Ages and then came into their own in Tudor England. Christmas in Merrie Olde England was seen by the Puritans as a bit too merry. The holiday had come to be marked by bearbaiting, beer and ale, and other spirits flowing in the taverns on Christmas Eve, rowdy crowds celebrating ""the Lord of Misrule."" Come Christmas morning, minstrel-like parades would march down the aisles in churches where services were being held. Unable to rein in the excesses, the Puritans turned their back on Christmas altogether. Not just the celebrations and traditions, Christmas Day itself. It would be just another day. Their no-Christmas policy -- no way, no how, spelled N-E-V-E-R -- crossed the Atlantic with them on the Mayflower. When the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth in December 1620, they observed the Sabbath on Sunday, but, come Christmas Day, went ashore to work. Opinion: Does Texas need a 'Merry Christmas' law? Back in England, when the Puritans came to power under Cromwell, a proclamation was issued in 1652 decreeing that stores should remain open on December 25. In New England, such a law was formally on the books in Boston -- duly enacted by the Legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony on May 11, 1659, and not repealed until 1681. But Christmas had its appeal. The Rev. Increase Mather felt it necessary to address its evils in 1687: ""The generality of Christmas-keepers observe that Festival after such a manner as is highly dishonourable to the name of Christ. How few are there comparatively that spend those Holidays (as they are called) after an Holy manner. But they are consumed in Compotations, in Interludes, in playing at Cards, in Revellings, in excess of Wine, in mad Mirth; Will Christ the holy Son of God be pleased with such Services?"" In 1711, the Rev. Cotton Mather -- like father, like son -- railed against the holiday merriment: ""I hear of a Number of young People of both Sexes,"" he wrote, ""belonging, many of them, to my Flock, who have had on the Christmasnight, this last week, a Frolick, a reveling Feast, and Ball, which discovers their Corruption, and has a Tendency to corrupt them yet more."" It wasn't just the Mathers in their pulpits keeping a watchful eye out for signs of Christmas. Judge Samuel Sewall, who kept a diary that has given historians a rare look at daily life in Boston in the 18th century, has numerous diary entries expressing his elation at the sight of people going about their regular, daily business on Christmas Day, equally disdainful of any signs of awareness or recognition, much less celebration, of Christmas. A 1697 entry: ""Decemb- 25. 97. Snowy day: Shops are open, and Carts and sleds come to Town with Wood and Fagots as formerly, save what abatement may be allowed on account of the weather."" The Puritans were so vigilant, watchful for the slightest sign of ""keeping Christmas,"" because they saw any breach as the first step toward falling back under the domination of the Church of England from which they'd fled. And anyone who ""kept Christmas"" became an outcast, literally or figuratively. The tide started to turn in the late 18th century. The first waves of immigration to lap at the New England shores, like the flood tide that would come in the 19th century, tended to be from countries that observed Christmas. Not to be underestimated in its importance to the holiday, the ratification of the U.S. Constitution removed the fear of falling back under the heel of the Church of England when it decreed no establishment of a state religion, in fact, proclaimed a separation of church and state. But the Puritan hold on New England was strong. As late as 1856, December 25 was a common workday in Boston, and those who refused to go to work on Christmas Day were often dismissed. Some factory owners would even change the starting hours on Christmas Day to 5 a.m. -- workers who wanted to attend church services would either have to forgo them or be dismissed for being late to work. Opinion: Where Christmas really came from . Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote in a journal entry dated December 25, 1856: ""Not a very merry Christmas. We are in a transition state about Christmas here in New England. The old Puritan feeling prevents it from being a cheerful, hearty holiday, though every year makes it more so."" Across the pond, Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol,"" published December 19, 1843, was reconciling the centuries-old war over Christmas, the two sides clearly shown, battle lines drawn, in the opening pages when Scrooge's nephew drops by. ""A Merry Christmas uncle! God save you!"" cried a cheerful voice. .... ""Bah!"" said Scrooge. ""Humbug!"" ... ""Don't be cross, uncle!"" said the nephew. ""What else can I be,"" returned the uncle, ""when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon Merry Christmas! .... If I could work my will,"" said Scrooge indignantly, ""every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!"" ""Uncle,"" pleaded the nephew. ""Nephew,"" returned the uncle sternly, ""keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine."" ""Keep it!"" repeated Scrooge's nephew. ""But you don't keep it."" That, of course, was before the visits from the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come that wrought the 180-degree turn in Scrooge that, with the help of the Cratchits and Tiny Tim, gave us the Christmas we know and love today. But pockets of resistance lingered in Boston. In the early 1900s, a bride from Virginia, where Christmas was celebrated, married a man from Boston, where it was touch and go, and they settled into a place on Beacon Hill. As Christmas drew nigh, she asked around for a group that went caroling and found there was none. Thinking to start one, she found a problem. As the folks put it when they declined: ""Someone might hear us."" As late as the 1930s, some churches in Boston would be closed, a printed notice on the doors saying there would be no services Christmas Day. Today, the old Puritan concerns have been reduced to occasional outbursts about the commercialization of Christmas and the liquid aspect of the good cheer ... while the old carols and the newer songs by such songwriters as Irving Berlin can be heard in malls, large and small, mingling with the ringing of the bells at the Salvation Army collection kettles, or on the radio. If ""White Christmas"" is the best known of the newer songs, the one that conveys how much Christmas has come to mean to us may be the one that came out soon after when millions of World War II servicemen were still overseas -- ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"" (also recorded by Bing Crosby). The lyrics added to the poignancy: . I'll be home for Christmas . You can plan on me . Please have snow, and mistletoe . And presents on the tree. Remember, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" ends when George Bailey's brother, who has been away in the service, returns home Christmas Eve -- joining the family and friends around the Christmas tree in time to hear the bell ring when Clarence, the gentle angel, gets his wings. Dickens would be proud. And I'm keeping Christmas.","Val Lauder: How and when to celebrate Christmas has been debated for centuries .

"(CNN) -- A sun-starved Norwegian town has finally seen the light -- by installing giant mirrors on the surrounding mountains to reflect rays onto its market square. The small town of Rjukan sits deep in the narrow Vestfjord Valley, in the Telemark region south-west of Oslo. The towering peaks that surround it rise to almost 2,000 meters above sea level and block out the sunlight for half the year, meaning Rjukan residents live in a permanent shadow from September to March. But all that changed this week, with the official launch of a project first mooted a century ago. Three high-tech mirrors, with a combined reflective surface of 50 square meters, have been put into operation on a ridge on Gaustatoppen mountain, brightening up the previously gloomy town center by flooding it with up to 600 square meters of sunlight. Twenty-first century technology has made the $850,000 project possible, with heliostats -- computer-powered mirrors -- shifting every 10 seconds to track the movements of the sun during the day. But the idea to lighten up the dark town actually dates back 100 years. Rjukan was originally founded as a company town for Norsk Hydro, which set up a fertilizer plant here to utilize the hydro power from the nearby 104 meter Rjukanfossen waterfall. The story goes that the aluminum and renewable energy company's founder, Sam Eyde, wanted a way to brighten up the existence of his shadowed laborers -- and also to make them work more effectively during the winter. The local newspaper published a suggestion by local bookkeeper Oskar Kittelsen to use a mirror to reflect sunlight onto the town, and Eyde picked up on the idea. Technological limitations of the day meant the scheme never came to fruition, however, and instead northern Europe's first cable car (known as Krossobanen) was built in 1928 to give Rjukan residents sunlight exposure at the top of the mountain. More: Inside the cold heart of an Icelandic volcano . And that was that -- until the sun mirror concept was revived nearly a century later in 2005 by local artist Martin Andersen, who raised the sponsorship funds (mainly from Norsk Hydro) and interest in the project. Solar Tower Systems, a company that builds mirror systems for solar thermal power plants in hotter climes, was drafted in to install the mirrors on the mountain wall -- not an easy task. ""There's no road leading to the construction site,"" says CEO Joachim Maass. ""You can hike there in an hour or so, but there was no alternative than to carry heavy equipment there by helicopter."" There was no way to get a heavy crane up there, so Maass had to improvise to maneuver the six-meter high mirrors into place. ""We used ancient tools, such as tripods made from wood nine meters long which we could bend together. We lifted this modern equipment with technology that people used 100 years ago, and it worked really well."" As well as improving the vitamin D intake of residents, tourism officials hope that the sun mirrors will boost the city's winter visitor numbers. More: 10 things to know before visiting Sweden . ""It's magnificent now that it's in place,"" says Tracy Murphy, owner of town center business CafÃ© Nye Tider. ""[This week's] mirror reveal was something that has never happened before -- sun in the middle of Rjukan. ""It's amazing and it gives the town a real draw in the winter time. Most of tourism in the winter is focused on snow sports in the mountains and ice climbing in the local areas around us. The fact that people will come to town just to see if the sun is shining is fantastic."" Rjukan's mayor, Steinar Bergsland, agrees. ""The sun mirror means a lot to Rjukan, both for tourism and for industry, which is our origin,"" he says. ""It's a perfect combination of technology and art -- and of course it is a great welfare activity for the citizens of Rjukan."" Not that Rjukan is without its attractions already. As well as the cable car (Krossobanen; +47 35 09 00 27) and the winter sports on Gaustatoppen Mountain, the town is near the vast mountain plateau of Hardangervidda National Park, good for hiking, cross-country skiing and reindeer spotting, among other activities. The area is also the location of the World War II sabotages made famous by the 1965 movie ""The Heroes of Telemark."" Rjukan's industrial heritage is celebrated in the Norwegian Industrial Workers Museum, and could even see it earn UNESCO World Heritage status by 2015 (it's currently on the 'nominated' list). Thanks to a 100-year old idea, visitors can also come for a spot of sunshine, too. Getting there: . Rjukan is a 2.5 hour coach journey from Oslo Airport. Coaches run five times a day.

"(CNN) -- Amidst loving squeezes and oohs and aahs (from her), and slobbery kisses and a wagging tail (from him), Nina Pham was reunited Saturday with her beloved King Charles spaniel and ""best friend,"" Bentley. ""It feels like Christmas literally,"" Pham said Saturday. ""I just can't imagine just having my best friend back. It's an amazing feeling.""

"(CNN) -- I have a memory of standing by the fence in my neighbor's yard. I was 6. My sister and I have had to run next door because mom's been wasted for weeks on end, and now she's got a shotgun. She's fired it once already. Two of the taller neighborhood kids are nearby, one standing on top of the other's shoulders, peering over the fence and describing what she sees. ""Your grandpa's got a 2 by 4 and he's going into the house."" The scene ends. I could tell you dozens of stories like this. Years later, I learned that grandpa had broken down the door to find mom on the bed with a shotgun and a suicide note, maybe too scared to pull the trigger. My mother was a lifelong addict -- from heroin to alcohol and pills to methadone and pills. If you asked her why, she would tell you she just liked getting high. If you were inclined to believe the prevailing sentiment about addiction as a kind of degenerate hedonism, you could hate her for being a junky screw-up, and for never managing to put anyone or anything before her addiction. Watch video: Living with my mother's addiction . And it wasn't just my mother. Mental illness, drug addiction and suicidal tendency ran so thick in my family that as a teenager I just waited for the day when I would get mine. The medical professionals in those days just focused on the genes. They didn't talk as much about the life circumstances surrounding the addicts. But a few years ago, I started to hear some different ideas. ""Addictions always originate in pain, so the question is never really why the addiction, but why the pain,"" said Dr. Gabor Mate, a Canadian physician who specializes in the study and treatment of addiction. He went on to say that nearly every single one of his skid row junkies had a severe history of childhood trauma. How heroin kills you . This idea was new to me. I began to learn more about the effects of trauma on the human psyche, and I found my family on every page of the literature. Mental illnesses of all kinds, suicidal tendency and addiction are all the remnants of a past severely marred by abuse, neglect and the utter lack of control over one's circumstances. I learned that unresolved trauma fractures the psyche, and hardwires the brain to permanently elevated levels of stress. The result is that chronically traumatized people no longer have any baseline state of calm or comfort. Owing to these chronically elevated stress levels, substances like alcohol and heroin, which offer an intoxicating buzz to the average person, give the chronically traumatized individuals their first taste of soothing and calm, which make them feel normal for the first time in their lives. I went from heroin addict to PTA mom . Letting some of this new understanding take root, I found that I could begin to forgive my then ailing mother for the harm she and her addictions had caused over the years. I could grieve for the difficult life she must have lived before my birth, even if I didn't understand the details, and I could offer her a compassion that I didn't think I was capable of before. And then something unexpected happened. Released from the firewall of my rage, she was able to open up and tell me about her own history of trauma. Caught between a sexually abusive uncle and an emotionally abusive mother, she had turned to black-out binge drinking at age 14, and it had been one substance or another every day ever since. And here's where the light went on. Talking to my mother, I realized that nothing that our punitive systems and shaming culture might inflict on her would ever be greater than the internal suffering that compelled her to constantly seek obliteration of her own life with substances and suicide attempts. I now believe that punishing those who are already suffering will never foster the kind of change we all so desperately need these individuals to make. Because this particular addict was my mother, I had the incentive to do the hard work of finding the human being behind the nightmare, of letting go of the disgust and blame, and seeing an incredibly wounded person in need of our support. This is much harder to do when the person is a stranger on the street, or in the prison system. My mother died of lung cancer six months ago. I can't speak to what may have happened if she had access to truly empathetic health care and trauma counseling. I can say that understanding her pain, and the roots of her addiction, has been incredibly healing for me. Opinion: We can prevent fatal ODs like Hoffman's . We need a society that focuses less on retribution and more on recovery for its most troubled members. We need to design policies that enable people to end their cycles of violent and addictive behaviors. Punishment is not an end in itself, and may lead to more damage, and the exacerbation of these cycles. What if we were to take a moment to realign our values toward seeing the injured human behind the unconscionable actions? Could we then do better at creating systems within which people can actually heal and change and recover? I believe that by starting with the right questions -- simple and compassionate -- like ""Why the pain?"" we can come up with better solutions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Caledonia Curry.","Caledonia Curry: My mother was a lifelong addict -- from heroin to alcohol to pills .

""In light of this news, AC/DC asks that Malcolm and his family's privacy be respected during this time. The band will continue to make music."" Young, 61, formed the group in 1973 in Sydney, Australia, with his brother Angus. The statement did not reveal what his illness was, though rumors have swirled since an e-mail was sent to a Perth, Australia, radio station earlier this week. Mark Gable, a fellow musician, told Australia's ABC Radio that Malcolm Young ""is sick. ... It's not just that he is unwell, it's that it is quite serious."" Gable's remarks were reported in the Sydney Morning Herald. The hard-rocking group, whose albums include the multimillion-selling ""Back in Black"" and ""For Those About to Rock (We Salute You),"" quickly rose in the music world thanks to their terse riffs and tireless touring. Lead guitarist Angus Young, then and now, is known for wearing a schoolboy uniform on stage. Bon Scott, who sang lead for the band in the '70s, died in 1980 just as ""Highway to Hell"" became AC/DC's breakthrough album. He was replaced by Brian Johnson, who sang on AC/DC's biggest chart hits, including ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" and ""Thunderstruck."" The group has continued putting out million-sellers to the present day. AC/DC's most recent studio album, ""Black Ice"" (2008), debuted at No. 1 in 29 countries -- including the United States -- sold 6 million copies and produced the Grammy-winning track ""War Machine."" It was the second biggest-selling album of the year. Malcolm Young's guitar has been a major part of the AC/DC sound -- a sound often slammed by rock critics but beloved by fans of hard rock and heavy metal. Other guitarists, including Megadeth's Dave Mustaine, rank him highly. Young has said he's proud of the band's straightforward, powerhouse crunch. ""People can go out and hear R.E.M. if they want deep lyrics, but at the end of the night, they want to go home and get f*****! That's where AC/DC comes into it,"" he once said.

"(CNN) -- When George Washington Vanderbilt, a descendent of the prominent Vanderbilt family, moved into his expansive new home in Asheville, North Carolina, back in 1895, he invited friends and family over for a lavish party on Christmas Eve. The holiday tradition continues to this day at Biltmore House, as the 250-room French Renaissance-style chÃ¢teau celebrates the holidays with an elaborate Victorian era-inspired spectacle boasting 56 hand-decorated Christmas trees, 1,000 poinsettias, 300 luminaries and miles and miles of fresh garland. But the Biltmore isn't the only grand U.S. estate that puts on a show come December. Here's the scoop on what Biltmore House and five other historic homes are doing to commemorate this special time of year. Biltmore Estate . Asheville, North Carolina . Widely considered one of the South's most beloved holiday destinations, the Biltmore attracts visitors from near and far for its seasonal tribute covering practically every inch of the 135,000-square-foot manse and surrounding 8,000 acres. But the celebration doesn't stop at the decorations. In addition to the usual daily self-guided tours of America's largest home, where you can view the Vanderbilts' original collection of furnishings, art and antiques, there are special nightly candlelight tours, visits with Santa, holiday decorating seminars led by the Biltmore's floral and gardening experts, a gingerbread house tea, musical performances and more. Adult tickets start at $49 for daytime entry in December. Evening visits start at $69 for adults. Reservations may be required on busy days. 8 great places to completely unplug . Winchester Mystery House . San Jose, California . In 1884, Sarah Winchester, a New England rifle heiress grieving the loss of her husband and child, started construction on an unusual California mansion she believed would appease evil spirits. She continued to add on to the sprawling Victorian house until her own passing 38 years later. Today, the estate is a popular tourist attraction for both its extravagant design (it boasts 160 rooms, 2,000 doors, 10,000 windows and 47 stairways) and the supposed paranormal activities surrounding it. But each holiday season, it's the spirit of Christmas that takes over. Daily tours show off the more than 20 designer Christmas trees and other colorful embellishments, with roving carolers, violinists and other performers making select nighttime tours even more joyous. Visitors can also enjoy the hot chocolate bar, snap family Christmas photos and shop in the boutique for ornaments and other gifts. Daytime holiday tours are $33 for adults. Adults pay $20 for evening admission to holiday events. Best affordable island hotels . The Breakers, The Elms and Marble House . Newport, Rhode Island . The town of Newport has multiple properties on the National Register of Historic Places, all of which were once the summer ""cottages"" of wealthy silver heiresses, senators and the like. Three of these decadent Gilded Age dwellings deck their halls each December for the annual Christmas at the Newport Mansions event, where festival goers can chat with jolly ol' Saint Nick (eggnog and cookies provided), attend evening concerts, capture pics of the gingerbread masterpieces created by local pastry chefs and more. The opulent ""cottages"" hosting holiday events are The Breakers, an Italian Renaissance-style palazzo finished in 1895 for Cornelius Vanderbilt II; The Elms, a summer house completed in 1901 for coal magnate Edward Julius Berwind; and Marble House, which was inspired by the Petit Trianon at Versailles and completed in 1892 for Mr. and Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt. The homes will be open for tours as well, each of them festooned with holiday finery as they would have been back in their heyday. A Winter Passport for admission to all three houses is $28 for adults. Hillwood Estate, Museum & Gardens . Washington, D.C. The name Marjorie Merriweather Post is familiar to many as the former owner of another one of this country's most impressive estates -- Mar-A-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida. But it was at this neo-Georgian-style mansion surrounded by 13 acres of formal gardens in northwest D.C. where she would live out the rest of her life. In 1977, it became a museum showcasing both her impeccable taste and worldly possessions, including one of the most comprehensive collections of Russian imperial art outside of that country. In keeping with Post's interest in Russian culture, Hillwood hosts, among other Christmas-themed events, an annual Russian Winter Festival. Grandfather Frost (Russia's version of Santa Claus) and his granddaughter, the Snow Maiden, are on hand for the festivities, which include traditional bands, choirs, and dancing and the chance to make an authentic ladies' kokoshnik (headdress) or gentlemen's winter hat. This year's festival will be held December 14 and 15. Admission to the festival is $18 for adults. Oak Alley Plantation . Vacherie, Louisiana . This gorgeous antebellum plantation along the banks of the Mississippi, named for the row of centuries-old live oaks leading up to the main house, has its share of stories -- there's an old slave quarters on site -- but the setting is hard to beat. The estate is even more enticing when embellished with fresh fruit, lush greenery and other Creole touches as it would have been in holidays past. The 1850s Christmas decor is on view all month. Another yearly tradition here is the lively Christmas Bonfire Party, complete with costumed hostesses, a brass quintet, carolers, dancing and nonstop food and drink, culminating with hot chocolate and beignets from 11 to midnight. This year's bonfire event on December 7 is already sold out, so if the idea is enticing, mark December 6 on your calendar for next year's blaze. Eats and beats also dominate the Christmas Sunday Jazz Brunch held a couple of weekends later on December 22 and reservations are still available. The brunch is $50 per person and $25 for children under 12. Admission to the house is $20 for adults. Hearst Castle . San Simeon, California . It's been said that Christmas was one of William Randolph Hearst's favorite holidays and that an invitation to the decadent holiday parties he threw at his magnificent West Coast compound was quite the get. Luckily you don't have to wait for an invite to experience Hearst Castle in all of its seasonal splendor. Decorated as it would have been back in the 1920s and 1930s during the famed newspaper magnate's reign, this 165-room Moorish castle is a sight to behold, from the grand social rooms on the ground floor to the private rooms on the upper levels. The Grand Rooms Tour ($25 for adults) and the Evening Tour ($36 for adults) are recommended for viewing the holiday decorations.","Lavish estates are prime spots for soaking up lavish holiday displays .

Newport, Rhode Island's Gilded Age ""cottages"" are not too shabby either ."

"(CNN) -- Irish lawmakers overwhelmingly passed new legislation early Friday that allows abortions if the mother's life is at risk. Members of Parliament in the devoutly Catholic country spent hours before its passage debating the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013. The vote was 127-31 in favor of the bill. Conservative and progressive lawmakers argued over amendments to the draft law. Religious lawmakers and church leaders are upset over a provision allowing abortion if a pregnant woman is acutely at risk of committing suicide. They called it a ""Trojan horse"" leading to easy abortion access and wanted it removed, but the provision was included in the final bill, according to The Irish Times. A woman can't just threaten to commit suicide and expect to receive an abortion, according to the bill. Two psychiatrists and an obstetrician must certify that the risk of suicide is ""real and substantial."" Female lawmakers introduced an amendment to permit abortions if a woman becomes pregnant after incest or rape, but later shelved it when it ran into resistance, the Times reported. In its final provisions, the bill underlines existing Irish laws to protect the fetus. ""It shall be an offense to intentionally destroy unborn human life,"" it reads. A woman who violates the law could face a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. The bill has proved divisive even within the government. European Affairs Minister Lucinda Creighton, who was opposed to elements of the legislation, resigned Thursday, Prime Minister Enda Kenny confirmed. Doctors and hospital personnel involved in illegal abortions face the same punishment, according to the bill. Woman's death in Ireland abortion case ruled 'medical misadventure' The issue was brought to the forefront last year when a 31-year-old woman died after doctors refused to perform a life-saving abortion. Savita Halappanavar went into a hospital in Galway, Ireland, in October, complaining of severe back pain. Doctors established Halappanavar, who was 17 weeks pregnant, was having a miscarriage. But they did not terminate the pregnancy, afraid the law would not allow it. Three days after the request for a termination was made, the fetus died and was removed. Four days later, Savita died of a blood infection. Public outrage over her death likely hastened the passage of the new legislation. It was proposed after a 2010 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, but had been moving slowly through the legislative system. The European Court of Human Rights found that Ireland's failure to regulate access to abortion had led to a violation of its human rights obligations. Twenty years ago, the Irish Supreme Court ruled abortions are allowed when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. But the ruling was never enacted into law, meaning there was little clarity for doctors or patients as to when an abortion could not take place. Human Rights Watch said the new legislation failed Ireland's women by not going far enough to reform the country's abortion laws. It did ""the bare minimum"" to comply with the European court ruling, and did not address other issues such as the rights of women who are pregnant as a result of rape, it said in a statement. ""The new law does add clarity, but requiring women to seek multiple approvals from health professionals may delay or defeat access to legal abortions,"" said Gauri van Gulik, women's rights advocate for Human Rights Watch. ""Ultimately it does little to improve the draconian restrictions on abortions."" Husband testifies his wife died after abortion was denied in Ireland . Opinion: If Ireland had abortion rights .

"(CNN) -- The United States stepped up preparations for a possible swine flu epidemic, and Canada confirmed its first cases on Sunday as researchers worked to determine how contagious the virus could be. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano briefs reporters at the White House Sunday. Keiji Fukuda, the assistant director-general of the World Health Organization, called the outbreak ""serious"" on Sunday. Researchers are still trying to determine how easily the virus is transmitted person to person and it's too early to predict whether there will be a mild or serious pandemic, said Fukuda. Dr. Alejandro Macias, an epidemiologist and adviser to the federal Ministry of Health, told CNN en Español that the official death toll was at 86. Macias said five more deaths in Mexico City had been reported to federal authorities by local authorities in the city. Earlier, Mexican President Felipe Calderon said 81 deaths were suspected to be from the outbreak and 374 people remained hospitalized. Another 929 people have been examined and sent home, he said. ""These people have shown up at some medical institution in the country with respiratory symptoms that required to be studied and diagnosed,"" he said. Mexico City closed all of its schools and universities until further notice because of the virus, and troops passed out filter masks outside the National Cathedral on Sunday morning. No masses were scheduled at the cathedral, but dozens of worshippers put on masks and went inside the church to pray on their own. Mexican Finance Minister Augustin Carstens said Sunday that the World Bank was lending Mexico $205 million to deal with the outbreak. ""We are getting an immediate loan of $25 million for the requisition of medicines, medical equipment and epidemiological equipment and in addition, $180 million to build up strategic operational and institutional capacities to deal with this issue,"" he said. Russia announced it is banning meat imports from Mexico and the southern United States due to the outbreak of swine flu, the Interfax news agency reported. Passengers arriving in Russia from Mexico and the United States also will be screened for swine flu, the news agency reported, by having their temperatures taken upon arrival. Canada confirmed six cases of mild illnesses on Sunday, and the United States reported 20. Meanwhile, Spain, Israel and New Zealand were investigating possible but unconfirmed cases. In Washington, the head of the Centers for Disease Control said 20 cases had been confirmed in five U.S. states by noon Sunday. The largest number of cases was in New York, where the CDC confirmed cases in eight students at a preparatory school in that city, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Sunday. Another seven cases have been confirmed in California, two each in Kansas and Texas and one in Ohio, said Dr. Richard Besser, the CDC's acting director. Only one person has had to be hospitalized, but Besser said authorities are likely to see ""a broader spectrum of disease"" in the days ahead. ""Given the reports out of Mexico, I would expect that over time we're going to see more severe disease in this country,"" he said. Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones said the symptoms seen there -- headaches, fevers, coughs and muscle aches -- were mild by the standards of serious flu cases. But he added, ""It's still pretty miserable."" The U.S. government declared a public health emergency -- a step Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said ""sounds more severe than really it is."" ""This is standard operating procedure and allows us to free up federal state and local agencies and their resources for prevention and mitigation,"" she said. The outbreak ""is of great concern to the White House,"" said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, but, he added, ""It's certainly not a time to panic."" ""If you're sick, stay home, get treatment, go see a doctor,"" Gibbs told reporters. ""The government is taking all the steps it needs to and must do to take the precautions to deal with whatever size and scope we may be facing,"" he said.  Watch how public health officials grade phases of pandemic alerts » . Meanwhile, the U.S. military issued a worldwide caution, telling its medical personnel to be on the lookout for troops with signs of swine flu and reiterated the need for public health precautions. The WHO ordered countries worldwide to look out for ""unusual"" outbreaks of flu following an emergency meeting Saturday. WHO official Gregory Hartl said the strain of the virus seen in Mexico is worrisome because it has mutated from older strains. iReport.com: Do you think we should be worried about swine flu? ""Any time that there is a virus which changes ... it means perhaps the immunities the human body has built up to dealing with influenza might not be adjusted well enough to dealing with this new virus,"" he said. A spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association, which represents the U.S. airline industry, said the group is taking the matter seriously. Airport employees and flight crews are on the lookout for any passengers who show signs of illness, and procedures are in place for determining whether ill passengers may fly, Andrus said. At Los Angeles International Airport, custodians have been instructed to pay additional attention to sanitizing door knobs, handrails and faucets in airport restrooms, according to a statement from Los Angeles World Airports. ""In addition, public education signs with general tips on preventing the spread of illnesses -- that are posted throughout the airport during regular flu season -- are being re-posted,"" the statement said. The H1N1 strain of swine flu is usually associated with pigs. When the flu spreads person to person, instead of from animals to humans, it can continue to mutate, making it a tougher strain that is harder to treat or fight off. Symptoms of swine flu include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, coughing, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, the CDC said.  Learn more about swine flu and how to treat it » . In New Zealand, officials said 22 students and three teachers, who returned from a three-week language trip to Mexico, may have been infected with the swine flu virus. The group remains quarantined at home, and Health Minister Tony Ryall said 10 students tested positive for influenza A -- the general category of strains that includes the H1N1 swine flu. In Spain, six people, all of whom had recently returned from Mexico, were being isolated in hospitals, the country's health ministry reported. And in Israel, doctors are running tests on a man who recently returned from Mexico with light flu symptoms.

"(CNN) -- Director Paul Feig might find himself leading a ""Ghostbusters"" reboot with an all-female cast, according to reports from Variety and The Hollywood Reporter. Feig, who helmed high-performing, female-led comedies ""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat,"" is said to have caught the eye of studio Sony to direct a new ""Ghostbusters"" film. It would be a reboot of the comedy, with actresses taking on the lead ""Ghostbuster"" roles. According to Variety, it's unclear whether this project would take the place of the previously announced ""Ghostbusters 3"" movie, or if this is a separate project altogether. ""Ghostbusters 3"" was announced in 2011, and Sony's Columbia Pictures told Vanity Fair in June 2014 that it's ""currently working hard to re-create the magic of the original in order to bring a new 'Ghostbusters' adventure to life."" Still, the project hasn't been without its stumbling blocks. Bill Murray has declined to participate, the script has changed hands, and the passing of ""Ghostbusters"" star and co-writer Harold Ramis in February 2014 was another blow. Following Ramis' death, director Ivan Reitman, who helmed both 1984's ""Ghostbusters"" and 1989's ""Ghostbusters II,"" decided not to direct the third ""Ghostbusters"" feature but has remained with the movie as a producer. While reports warn that no formal negotiations between Feig and the studio have taken place, it does seem that Feig is intrigued by the idea. On Twitter over the weekend, he re-tweeted reaction to the news that he could lead an all-female ""Ghostbusters,"" and also appeared to respond to those who've scoffed at the all-women concept as a ""gimmick.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama renewed his push for comprehensive immigration reform Thursday, calling for bipartisan cooperation on an issue that has repeatedly proven to be a major cause of deep social and political division. The president tried to find what has often proven to be an elusive middle ground on the subject, highlighting the importance of immigrants to American history and progress while also acknowledging the fear and frustration many people now feel with a system that seems ""fundamentally broken."" He asserted that the majority of Americans are ready to embrace reform legislation that would help resolve the status of an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. ""I believe we can put politics aside and finally have an immigration system that's accountable,"" Obama told an audience at Washington's American University. ""I believe we can appeal not to people's fears, but to their hopes, to their highest ideals. Because that's who we are as Americans."" The president targeted Arizona's controversial new immigration law, which requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there's reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. It also targets businesses that hire illegal immigrant laborers or knowingly transport them. The measure -- currently under review by the Justice Department -- has ""fanned the flames of an already contentious debate,"" Obama said. It puts pressure on police officers to enforce rules that are ""unenforceable"" while making communities less safe -- in part, by making people more reluctant to report crimes. It also has ""the potential of violating the rights of innocent American citizens and legal residents, making them subject to possible stops or questioning because of what they look like or how they sound."" Arizona's Republican governor, Jan Brewer, responded Thursday that Obama was failing to secure the border with Mexico, which forced her state to act on its own. ""Do your job. Secure the border,"" Brewer said of the president in a speech to a Republican group. She pledged to ""defend this law against every assault, including attacks by the Obama administration."" In his speech, Obama warned that rounding up everyone in the country who has entered illegally would be both ""logistically impossible"" and ""tear at the fabric of the nation."" At the same time, the president indicated it would be wrong to offer blanket amnesty for people who came into the United States unlawfully. To do so ""would suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision. And this could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration. ... It would also ignore the millions of people around the world who are waiting in line to come here legally."" Ultimately, he said, ""our nation, like all nations, has the right and obligation to control its borders and set laws for residency and citizenship. And no matter how decent they are, no matter their reasons, the 11 million who broke these laws should be held accountable."" Obama said those who entered the country illegally must admit they broke the law, register with the appropriate authorities, pay taxes, pay a fine, and learn English. They must ""get right with the law before they can get in line and earn their citizenship."" The president urged Congress to tackle immigration reform legislation, but stressed that it would require support from both Democrats and Republicans. ""That is the political and mathematical reality,"" he said. Obama's remarks, however, immediately received a cold reception from one top Senate Republican. Obama and congressional Democrats ""made a strategic decision to put immigration on the back burner, and they now claim they can't even propose immigration legislation without a Republican,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. ""It's time for the president and congressional Democrats to stop the charade. Op-eds, outlines and speeches won't cut it anymore."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, in turn lashed out the GOP, arguing that ""instead of matching the leadership of Democrats to solve this problem and engaging in good faith negotiations, Republicans continue to engage in political grandstanding and polarizing rhetoric that encourages intolerance of our vibrant immigration population."" Reid, who is facing a tough reelection fight this year, is hoping for a strong turnout among Latino voters in November in his home state. Despite Obama's call for bipartisan immigration reform, several senior Democratic sources said Thursday that they see virtually no chance of Congress taking up such a measure before November's midterm elections. Though some hold out hope for potential movement during a lame-duck session of Congress after the election, most sources say the more realistic earliest target is next year. But even that, according to one source, may be ""happy talk."" Still, these sources said that, politically, it was crucial for the president to give a speech like he did Thursday in order to put pressure on Republicans and, more importantly, to reassure angry Latino voters that Democrats haven't forgotten about the issue. A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation national poll conducted in late May indicated that public support for beefing up security along the U.S. border with Mexico had grown significantly. According to the survey, nearly nine out of 10 Americans want to beef up U.S. law enforcement along the border with Mexico. Eight in 10 questioned also supported a program that would allow illegal immigrants already in the United States to stay here and apply for legal residency if they had a job and paid back taxes. But only 38 percent say that program should be a higher priority than border security and other get-tough proposals. Six in 10 said border security was the higher priority. Obama's speech followed a highly anticipated meeting this week in which the president discussed immigration reform with grass-roots reform advocates. ""From our meeting, it is clear that the president is committed to comprehensive immigration reform and understands that congressional action is needed urgently,"" said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum and a meeting attendee. Other topics discussed at the meeting included concerns the grass-roots leaders had about reforms to current detention and deportation procedures, Noorani said.

"Washington (CNN) -- When Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, pronounced this week that ""17 angry old white men will wake up and realize they've just bought the country,"" after the elections, he echoed the distaste many Americans feel at the secrecy surrounding the flood of money pouring into campaigns. Political experts estimate $6 billion will be spent during the 2012 presidential elections — a large chunk of it via anonymous donors thanks to a Supreme Court ruling which allows unlimited corporate campaign donations. That's enough money to give 6/7ths of the world's population $1 each. Politicos and even comedians have made much ado about the influence of anonymous super rich donors and well heeled super PACs, groups that can raise money from a number of sources and spend unlimited amounts independent of and in support of political campaigns. Democrats on Capitol Hill bemoaned failed efforts this week at forcing out of the shadows political campaign donors who give more than $10,000 to independent groups. Republicans called Democratic efforts a disingenuous attempt to silence critics by going ""after the microphone instead, by trying to scare off the funders,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, long an advocate of campaign donations as a form of free speech. Senate Republicans block DISCLOSE Act for second straight day . ""We are determined to prove that transparency is not a radical concept,"" Sen. Tom Udall, D-New Mexico, said of the bill to force groups to reveal big donors' identities. ""Our bill is as simple and straightforward as it gets -- if you are making large donations to influence an election, the voters in that election should know who you are. The American people are blessed with common sense. They know that when someone will not admit to something, it is usually because there is something to hide."" It's an issue that's chock-ful of sermonizing and spin. ""Every election we have a lot of hand-wringing... but this issue has been with us a long time,"" said Michael Toner, a former Federal Election Commission chairman and a veteran campaign finance attorney. The fact is the Supreme Court has found that this practice qualifies as free speech. The fact is lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have punted -- repeatedly -- on forcing big donors to disclose their identities. Lawmakers such as McConnell once supported transparency for these types of donations but later vociferously advocated anonymity to protect donors from harassment. The fact is both major political parties and conservative and liberal groups alike have benefited for decades from money donated from the shadows. ""Yes, there are some pretty rich people who support super PACs because they have some strong ideas. The super PACS are not the evil so many people portray them to be,"" said Joel Gora, a Brooklyn Law School professor who worked on Buckley v. Valeo, the landmark 1970s Supreme Court case that determined spending money to influence elections is a form of free speech. Pro-Obama super PAC raises $6.1 million in June . ""Just because some people can speak more than other people, the solution is not to prevent them to speaking,"" Gora said. ""It's to help...level up free speech for everybody."" Still, something about it, for many folks, just feels, well, wrong. A poll conducted in April of roughly 1,000 likely voters by the the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that ""one in four Americans — 26% — say they are less likely to vote because big donors to super PACs have so much more influence over elected officials than average Americans."" Pro-Romney super PAC brings in $20 million in June . For some voters, big dollars means big trouble for the electoral process. ""Of course that kind of money spells trouble! If nothing else, it leaves the suspicion that the office is for sale to the highest bidder,"" Phil Clouser said on CNN Politics' Facebook page. ""Campaign spending should be limited to whatever the office will pay for that term."" Others feel the bluster over anonymous donors is a red herring. President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney ""will each spend a lot on advertising as is usually done. This election is much more important to conservatives so they are making a lot of contributions to Romney,"" Judi Purcell said on CNN Politics' Facebook page. ""Obama has gone to a lot of fundraisers so he has a lot of money too. That's the way is it and those who don't like it don't have to like it."" Why Democrats need labor unions .","Roughly $6 billion will be spent on presidential election -- much through anonymous donors .
The Supreme Court has ruled that this practice qualifies as free speech .

"Deauville, France (CNN) -- President Barack Obama landed in France on Thursday for meetings with the leaders of the world's top economic powers after a high-profile visit to London. Obama discussed a range of security and economic issues during a one-on-one meeting with Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev. He also met with Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and participated in a full day of talks with other leaders of the Group of Eight nations. The G8 includes the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and Russia. Obama told Kan that Americans were ""heartbroken"" by the devastation created by Japan's recent tsunami and subsequent nuclear disaster. ""The United States will stand by Japan for as long as it takes for Japan to recover,"" Obama said. ""And I'm confident it will recover."" Kan thanked Obama for American disaster recovery assistance. The two men agreed Kan will make an ""official visit"" to Washington in September, according to Daniel Russel, a senior U.S. National Security Council staff member. Obama is in the middle of a six-day, four-nation trip to Europe that began in Ireland and will end in Poland. Obama's meetings in France came on the heels of a visit to London, where he became the first U.S. president to address a joint session of the British Parliament at famed Westminster Hall. During his speech, Obama argued that Western leadership of the world remains ""essential to the cause of human dignity."" ""The longing for freedom and human dignity"" is ""universal, and it beats in every heart,"" Obama said. Obama linked this year's uprisings against regimes across the Middle East to the fall of communism in Europe, of white minority rule in South Africa and of dictatorships in Latin America and Southeast Asia, saying they reflect ""a longing for the same freedoms that we take for granted at home."" He also contended that the rise of China, India and Brazil was linked to their acceptance of free markets on the British and American models. Their ascendance does not mean that Western leadership is in decline, he insisted, saying: ""The time for our leadership is now."" Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron turned up the heat on Moammar Gadhafi in a joint appearance Wednesday, with the president saying that ""ultimately,"" the Libyan leader will go. The United Nations-endorsed mission to protect Libya's people from their leader means making sure Gadhafi ""doesn't have capacity to send in a bunch of thugs to murder innocent civilians and threaten them,"" Obama said. Queen Elizabeth II hosted a state dinner for Obama on Tuesday night.  The president and first lady also toured Buckingham Palace and visited Westminster Abbey, where crowds that had gathered along the roads outside cheered their arrival.

"(CNN) -- Thomas Eric Duncan traveled from Liberia to Texas before testing positive for Ebola. The first Ebola case diagnosed in the U.S. has raised many questions and concerns, which CNN has been responding to on social media using the hashtag #EbolaQandA. You can check out the latest updates on the story at CNN.com/Health. We'll continue to answer them online and on TV, but here are some of your most frequently asked questions: . How long can Ebola live on a surface? In one study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Ebola virus lived on a surface in a perfectly controlled environment for up to six days. But the environment at an airport, for example, or a school is not perfectly suited to support viruses. Studies done in Ebola Treatment Units in Africa, CDC spokeswoman Abbigail Tumpey says, show the virus can live on surfaces for a few hours at most. ""Ebola is a vicious virus inside the body, but it dies very quickly on surfaces,"" she said. ""It' s not a hardy virus. It's a very wimpy virus."" Ebola is easily destroyed outside of the body, experts say. UV light, heat and exposure to oxygen all deactivate the virus over time. CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said that while it's theoretically possible for someone to catch Ebola by touching a surface that an infected patient sneezed on, for example, past outbreaks have shown that direct contact with a patient's bodily fluids is the way the virus is spread. What kills the virus? Health care workers -- and CNN's reporters -- in West Africa rely on bleach. But the CDC says any EPA-approved disinfectant -- Chlorox, Lysol, etc. -- will work on a nonporous surface. A dishwasher or washing machine will also kill it, Tumpey says. Would any bodily fluids this patient flushed contaminate the water system? The virus wouldn't survive long in water, Jean-Paul Gonzalez at Metabiota, a company that tracks global infectious diseases, told NPR. The virus depends heavily, he said, on its host -- either a human or animal -- to stay active. U.S. sanitary sewers and our waste water treatment system will kill the virus, Tumpey agrees. ""There's no concern there."" Could the virus become airborne? Right now, ""common sense and observation tell us that spread of the virus via coughing or sneezing is rare, if it happens at all,"" the World Health Organization says. It's possible Ebola could eventually be transmitted through the air. Experts say the chances are relatively small that Ebola will make that jump. But every time a new person gets Ebola, the virus gets another chance to develop new capabilities. Ebola is an RNA virus, which means every time it copies itself, it makes one or two mutations. Yet WHO says, ""Speculation that Ebola virus disease might mutate into a form that could easily spread among humans through the air is just that: speculation, unsubstantiated by any evidence."" Will Duncan receive an experimental drug? Maybe. Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday the Dallas hospital was discussing all treatment options with the patient and his family. There is no approved drug or vaccine for Ebola. The experimental drug given to Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, the first Ebola patients flown to the United States, is called ZMapp. The company that produces ZMapp has said it is out of doses, though it is working to create more. Dr. Rick Sacra, the American doctor treated for Ebola in Nebraska, was given another experimental drug called TKM-Ebola. There are reportedly still doses of this drug available. Only the facts: Ebola experimental drugs . Are the people who were on his flights at risk? No. The Ebola virus spreads only when someone is exhibiting symptoms. This patient arrived in the United States on September 20, according to the CDC, and didn't get sick until several days later. So he wasn't contagious on the flight. He was put in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28 and will not be released until he is free of the virus. But how can they be sure he wasn't sick earlier? That's a fair question. They can't be 100% sure. But the first sign of Ebola is generally a high fever. And everyone leaving Liberia has their temperature checked before they're allowed to board a plane. Plus, health experts have said that anyone who is sick enough to be contagious probably doesn't feel well enough to travel in the first place. Why didn't the hospital release Duncan's name and photo earlier? The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act's Privacy Rule prevents hospitals or medical providers from releasing identifiable patient information without the patient's permission. When do Ebola symptoms start, and what are they? Ebola symptoms typically appear eight to 10 days after infection. But they can start anywhere from two to 21 days after infection. Early symptoms include a high fever, muscle aches and chills -- similar to early symptoms of the flu. The virus then progresses to severe vomiting and diarrhea, with a possible rash and painful cough. Patients near death sometimes bleed from their eyes, mouth or other orifices as they begin to bleed internally. Why aren't U.S. borders being closed to travelers from this region? The easiest way to prevent an Ebola outbreak in the United States is to prevent travelers from the region from flying here in the first place, right? ""We cannot make the [Ebola] risk zero until the outbreak is controlled in west Africa,"" Frieden said Thursday. He says isolating those countries completely through travel restrictions would make it more difficult to assist in controlling the outbreak and would eventually put the United States at greater risk. Think about all the health care workers, volunteers and military personnel who are selflessly going to West Africa to offer assistance. Should they be forced to stay overseas until the outbreak is over? Would as many go if they knew they wouldn't be allowed back? ""The international community is really asking us to continue operations,"" said Gert Sciot, a spokesman for Brussels Airlines. ""We are a vital link for logistics and all kinds of material that need to go into (Liberia)."" The CDC has warned against any nonessential travel to the region. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have been trained to spot common Ebola symptoms. Temperatures are not checked on arrival, but if a passenger arrives who is exhibiting symptoms, major international airports have the ability to quarantine him or her immediately. Customs agents have also begun distributing a CDC fact sheet on Ebola to travelers at major international airports. How the Ebola virus spreads . I'm traveling to Dallas soon. Should I be worried? Not really. The CDC and local health departments are working to find anyone Duncan came in contact with while he was contagious, and monitor them for symptoms. If any of them become contagious, they will be placed in isolation as well. But just to be safe, follow the basic rules of infection prevention: Avoid people who are sick and wash your hands frequently.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Blackwater USA guards have used deadly force weekly in Iraq and have inflicted ""significant casualties and property damage,"" according to a congressional staff report released Monday that cites internal company and State Department documents. Blackwater's contractors fired their weapons 195 times -- or an average of 1.4 times a week -- from the beginning of 2005 through the second week of September, the Democratic staff of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee found. In over 80 percent of the cases, Blackwater reports that its forces fired first, according to the staff report. The committee will hear from Blackwater's CEO Erik Prince on Tuesday. Read Prince's prepared statement (PDF) Records of the company and State Department show Blackwater's use of force in Iraq has been ""frequent and extensive,"" the report says. Though Blackwater is authorized to use force only defensively, ""the vast majority of Blackwater weapons discharges are pre-emptive, with Blackwater forces firing first at a vehicle or suspicious individual prior to receiving any fire,"" the report states. A Blackwater contractor wrote an initial U.S. government report describing contractors' involvement in a September 16 incident in which Iraqi civilians were shot, government and industry sources told CNN. The Iraqi government claims Blackwater contractors, who were guarding a U.S. diplomatic convoy, killed as many as 20 civilians in western Baghdad's Nisoor Square. The incident elicited outrage in Iraq and raised questions about the accountability of foreign security personnel in the country who, under an order by the U.S.-led occupation government, are not subject to Iraqi law. Blackwater said its employees responded properly to an insurgent attack on a convoy, and the State Department ""spot report"" written by the Blackwater contractor underscores that and doesn't mention civilian casualties. However, the contractor's account is at odds with Iraqis' version of the incident. A senior Iraqi National Police official participating in the Iraqi governmental probe of the shooting said the Blackwater gunfire was unprovoked and random, killing and wounding several civilians. Blackwater contractor Darren Hanner drafted the two-page spot report on the letterhead of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security for the embassy's Tactical Operations Center, said a source involved in diplomatic security at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Hanner, listed on the report as the center's watch officer, was working for Blackwater at the time the report was written -- just after the shooting occurred, said a highly placed industry source. He was to rotate out of Iraq last week, the source said. The center tracks and monitors all incidents and movements involving diplomatic security missions and has outsourced positions to Blackwater and another private firm, the embassy source said.  Watch aftermath video of the shooting obtained by Newsweek » . The State Department is conducting an investigation, and deputy spokesman Tom Casey called the spot report ""a first-blush account of those on the scene."" He said the ""report has no standing whatsoever."" ""It was not intended to be used as an analysis, investigation, review or any detailed assessment of the situation. To assert that is untrue,"" Casey said. A State Department agent took sworn statements from the participants in the shooting after receiving the spot report, the embassy source said. A joint U.S.-Iraqi commission is expected to examine security and safety issues and will receive results of the State Department investigation and a separate Iraqi investigation, the U.S. military said. The senior Iraqi police officer said Blackwater team members were questioned by Iraqi police immediately after the incident. The contractors first said they opened fire in response to a mortar attack, the officer said. However, the contractors then changed their story at least twice during the 90 minutes they were held, the officer said. Iraqi police released a video of the aftermath of the shooting which shows a car that had damage consistent with a rocket-propelled grenade. The video shows what appears to be the spent casing of a rifle-fired grenade, and the embassy source said the Blackwater guards were armed with a rifle-fired M-203 grenade. The embassy source said a New York Times story reporting investigators were told that at least one guard drew a weapon on a fellow guard who did not stop shooting after colleagues called for a cease-fire was ""pretty much true."" Blackwater previously denied reports that one Blackwater employee drew a gun on another.  Learn more about private contractors working in Iraq » . The embassy source, meanwhile, said Blackwater is suffering a staffing shortage as it tries to meet its mission of guarding U.S. diplomats moving around Baghdad and other sections of Iraq. Anne Tyrrell, a spokeswoman for Blackwater, denied that assertion. ""To my knowledge that's inaccurate,"" Tyrrell said. ""I would urge caution in trusting the source."" As State Department investigators arrived in Baghdad from Washington to investigate the shooting, many of the guards involved had ended their contracts with Blackwater and were leaving Iraq, the embassy source said, speaking anonymously because he is not authorized to speak to the media. The State Department official said as of Friday all guards that were involved in the incident were still in Iraq, except for one who had to be evacuated for medical reasons. ""It would be hard to do an investigation without the principal players there,"" the official said, referring to the State Department inquiries into the issue. ""We cannot take anybody out of the country during an investigation without U.S. government approval,"" Tyrrell said. ""It is inaccurate that the 19 men being investigated have left Iraq."" Several of the guards involved in the shooting have requested disability severance and others have not renewed their expiring contracts, the State Department source said. None of those involved are being sent on security missions, he said. The Iraqi government said it will file criminal charges against the Blackwater employees, according to Iraq's Interior Ministry. It's not clear how Iraqi courts would attempt to bring the contractors to trial.  E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- The Australian federal government has approved a plan to dump 3 million cubic meters of dredge spoil in the Great Barrier Reef Park. The dredged material will come from the proposed expansion of the coal port at Abbot Point, south of Townsville on the Queensland coast. Final approval came from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and is subject to ""strict conditions."" The proposal, while controversial and opposed by environmental groups including Greenpeace, had already been approved by Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt last month. Tony Abbott's government has come under fire for a raft of environmental decisions lately, including an election pledge to rescind expansion of Tasmania's World Heritage-listed forest reserve which has united environmental campaigners and the forestry industry, who see the plan as unworkable and damaging in the long term. The reef is the largest living structure on the planet, and is a hugely diverse ecosystem stretching 2,300 kilometers along the Queensland coast. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is 345,000 square kilometers in size and home to thousands of species of coral, fish, molluscs, jellyfish, sharks and whales. A statement released by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said the proposal was in line with directives to limit development of ports on the coast to existing facilities. ""As a deepwater port that has been in operation for nearly 30 years, Abbot Point is better placed than other ports along the Great Barrier Reef coastline to undertake expansion as the capital and maintenance dredging required will be significantly less than what would be required in other areas,"" said Dr Russell Reichelt, Authority Chairman. ""It's important to note the seafloor of the approved disposal area consists of sand, silt and clay and does not contain coral reefs or seagrass beds."" The Authority's General Manager for Biodiversity, Conservation and Sustainable Use, Bruce Elliot echoes the statement, saying that the environmental safeguards -- 47 in total -- insisted upon by the Authority would protect the reef and seagrasses, along with the social and heritage uses of the marine park. ""By granting this permit application with rigorous safeguards, we believe we are able to provide certainty to both the community and the proponent while seeking to ensure transparent and best practice environmental management of the project,"" he said. The plan has attracted widespread criticism and WWF Australia spokesman Richard Leck said the approval from the marine park authority marked a ""sad day for the reef and anyone who cares about its future."" The Great Barrier Reef was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1981 and environmental group Greenpeace warned that the move to allow dumping in the park may lead to that organization listing the site as ""in danger"" this year. ""This go-ahead for dumping is one more body blow for the Reef which further threatens marine life, its World Heritage status and Australia's tourism and fishing industries,"" Greenpeace Reef Campaigner Louise Matthiesson said on the group's website. ""Green lighting the reef's destruction makes a mockery of the Authority's charter which obliges it to protect the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the World Heritage Area.""","Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority approves plan to dump millions of tons of dredge spoil .

"(CNN) -- A suspicious fire early Thanksgiving morning destroyed another home in Detroit's popular Heidelberg Project, an internationally known art installation plagued by six suspected acts of arson in recent months. The latest blaze, at about 6 a.m. Thursday, engulfed ""The War Room,"" a vacant home decorated with colorful paintings, a Detroit fire official told CNN. The project transforms rundown houses into works of art. Project officials said the fire occurred dangerously close to the homes of local residents. ""Our only concern at this point is the safety of residents,"" Jenenne Whitfield, the project's executive director, said in a statement. ""We are working in full cooperation to do everything we can to put an end to this madness."" In the last two months, Heidelberg properties were hit with six suspicious fires that destroyed four vacant buildings -- ""Obstruction of Justice,"" ""House of Soul,"" ""The Penny House"" and ""The War Room,"" according to the project. Only three properties remain in the installation, which reportedly draws about 300,000 visitors from around the world each year. Investigators with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are working with Detroit fire officials in the probe. ""We see the fires as highly suspicious,"" ATF Special Agent Donald Dawkins told CNN. ""We are trying to get to the bottom of this."" The project last week started a campaign aimed at raising $50,000 in a month to install a security system at its properties. It has raised half the amount. In a statement Thursday, the Heidelberg Project said a man in dark clothing was seen fleeing the property by security guards in the area. State and federal officials said they have no suspects. The Heidelberg Project was created by artist Tyree Guyton in 1986 in an attempt to bring decaying homes back to life with decorations and transform the dilapidated properties into art installations. One of Detroit's top tourist attractions, the project was recently featured by CNN's Anthony Bourdain on ""Parts Unknown: Detroit.""","Suspicious fire destroys another Heidelberg Project property in Detroit .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Denver Post Editorial Board endorsed Republican House Rep. Cory Gardner on Friday, just six years after it backed Gardner's opponent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall for the position. ""Congress is hardly functioning these days. It can't pass legislation that is controversial and it often can't even pass legislation on which there is broad agreement. Its reputation is abysmal, and even its members rarely dispute the popular indictment,"" the editorial board said in a statement. ""It needs fresh leadership, energy and ideas, and Cory Gardner can help provide them in the U.S. Senate."" The surprising decision could give Gardner the significant edge he needs to pull ahead of Udall in the closely contested race. Just last week, a CBS/New York Times poll found Gardner six percentage points ahead of Udall. Real Clear Politics rules the race a ""toss up."" Udall is starting to trail his GOP opponent, two polls say . Earlier this week, both candidates argued over immigration, foreign policy, reproductive rights, and the Ebola outbreak. The board sided with Gardner, saying that his ideas largely reflect Colorado's interests, especially in the next two years. ""Gardner has sound ideas on tax reform that could help the economy take off and has expressed willingness to compromise on immigration despite a fairly hard line over the years. And his stance on defense spending appears closer to those of Rep. Mike Coffman, who favors restraint, than to those in the GOP who view the military as sacrosanct,"" the statement said. Yet the Denver Post went defensive against Gardner's conservative opinions on same-sex marriage and abortion rights. His position on the controversial issues didn't deter their endorsement, saying that the issues will likely be irrelevant soon since the Supreme Court is establishing an acceptable norm. Will same-sex marriage become a 2014 issue? The editorial board called Udall ""a fine man with good intentions"" and admitted that their views align closer with him than Gardner. However, they say that Udall has not been a prominent fighter on current issues, suggesting that Gardner's growing leadership in the House ""would very likely match"" Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet's influence in the upper chamber. They did praise Udall for being an active member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, particularly when he spoke out against the government for spying on the public. The Denver Post endorsed President Obama in 2012 and 2008, but did not make any specific mentions against his policies as a reason for supporting Gardner.

"(CNN) -- This week, Colin Powell, a retired four-star U.S. Army general perhaps best known for having served as Secretary of State under President George W. Bush, endorsed Barack Obama's bid for re-election during an interview with ""CBS This Morning."" Given that Powell had enthusiastically endorsed Obama in 2008, his decision to back him yet again shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Yet Powell's endorsement of a Democratic candidate is seen as significant because he describes himself as ""a Republican of a more moderate mold,"" who laments that GOP moderates are ""something of a dying breed."" Powell expressed discontent with the Republican stance on climate change, immigration and education, and he seemed more comfortable with Obama's approach to achieving fiscal balance than Mitt Romney's. Powell is also, among other things, a defender of racial preferences in college admissions and abortion rights. While it is certainly true that Powell's views were not uncommon among moderate and liberal Republicans of an earlier era, it is not entirely clear why he chooses not to identify as a Democrat or as a liberal-leaning independent. One assumes that Powell has some residual loyalty to the party of Nelson Rockefeller and Gerald Ford, which is, of course, fair enough. But would American democracy be better and healthier if we had more Republicans such as Powell and more Democrats such as, say, former U.S. Sen. Zell Miller, the Georgia Democrat who famously endorsed President George W. Bush at the 2004 Republican National Convention? LZ Granderson: Both parties have a race problem . Some believe that blurring the boundaries of the two major political parties would be a very good thing as it would make legislative compromise more likely. Historically, it is certainly true that avowedly centrist legislators, such as the Southern congressional Democrats who worked closely with Republican presidents such as Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, have played an important role in shaping policy. There is, however, a significant downside to this blurring of boundaries. Political scientists Richard Lau, David Anderson and David Redlawsk have argued that while we tend to focus on voter turnout as an important aspect of democratic citizenship, we should also pay attention to whether citizens are voting correctly. To vote correctly, in the view of Lau and company, is to vote in accordance with your fully informed preferences. And one of the surest ways to increase correct voting is to give voters races in which candidates are reasonably ideologically distinct. If, like Colin Powell, you strongly believe that we need more regulation of carbon emissions, an approach to deficit reduction that involves substantial increases in federal taxes as well as spending cuts, an immigration policy that gives unauthorized immigrants the opportunity to become lawful permanent residents without first requiring that they return to their country of origin, and an education policy that emphasizes higher levels of public spending over competition among educational providers, it wouldn't just be unusual to back Mitt Romney over Barack Obama -- it would actually be, in the sense articulated by Lau and his co-authors, incorrect. In light of the first-past-the-post nature of our electoral system, and the dominance of the two major political parties, candidates do tend to try to blur distinctions as general elections approach, thus raising the risk of incorrect voting. But as Democrats and Republicans have grown more ideologically coherent, as liberals have joined the Democrats and as conservatives have joined the Republicans, this risk has decreased considerably. One might still object to partisan polarization on the grounds that it makes compromise extremely difficult. Oddly enough, the best solution to this problem might not be weaker political parties, in which individual officeholders are less likely to toe the party line and more likely to cross the aisle, but rather stronger political parties. In ""Better Parties, Better Government,"" Joel Gora and Peter Wallison argue that successive legislative efforts to reform campaign finance have left the United States with a candidate-centered rather than a party-centered political system. Specifically, restrictions on the extent to which candidates can coordinate fundraising and campaigning efforts with party organizations have essentially left candidates to fend for themselves. While this might sound more attractive than a system with powerful party bosses, a candidate-centered system leads to a situation in which candidates have to spend enormous amounts of time and effort raising money, particularly if they are challenging incumbents. This in turn makes candidates dependent on donors, whether they are wealthy individuals or special interest groups. One result of a candidate-centered system is that many people who would make excellent public servants are effectively shut out of the political process. In a party-centered system, in contrast, candidates rely on the party for financial and organizational support. This gives the central party organization considerable leverage over candidates, which they can use to enforce some measure of party discipline. Parties would also be more resistant to capture by special interests than individual legislators, as they would be in a position to balance the needs of a much broader array of interests. So how would stronger parties improve the quality of governance? Whereas individual candidates are primarily interested in their own short-term survival, party organizations have a longer-term perspective. Stronger party organizations would, for example, have a strong incentive to develop a coherent legislative program, as doing so would help build the party brand. If the White House and Congress were controlled by the same party, this coherent legislative program could be implemented more easily under a party-centered system, in which legislators know what they've been put into office to accomplish, than under a candidate-centered system, in which its every legislator for herself or himself. Consider Obama's first two years, in which large numbers of congressional Democrats from marginal seats kept frustrating the party's agenda. These rebellious Democrats feared that sticking with the White House would cause them to lose their seats, but their efforts made Obama look weak, which in turn contributed to the GOP takeover of the House. Had these congressional Democrats been subject to stronger party discipline, the party as a whole might have been much better off. A party-centered system also works better in a divided government, as opposition parties wouldn't be solely dedicated to frustrating the president's agenda. Rather, they'd dedicate themselves to achieving their longer-term legislative objectives, which would often entail working with the other side. A stronger Republican party organization might have exerted more pressure on newly elected congressional Republicans to compromise on the debt limit, as the perception of GOP extremism may have damaged the party's brand in potentially winnable suburban districts outside of the South. Rather than blur partisan boundaries, what American democracy needs is a healthy dose of responsible partisanship.

"(CNN) -- The prosecutor in a rural California agricultural community says that police officers there preyed upon the poor, impounding their cars then selling the vehicles when the owners couldn't afford the fees. Six officers, including the former police chief of King City and his acting replacement, were arrested Tuesday in the corruption scheme, as was the owner of a towing company. Monterey County District Attorney Dean D. Flippo said the alleged scheme worked liked this: Sgt. Bobby Carrillo would impound a vehicle -- at least 200 of them -- and, though he was supposed to equally use one of four towing companies, he would call Miller's Towing 87% of the time. Carrillo targeted poor Latinos who couldn't pay the money required to retrieve their vehicles, prosecutors alleged. Brian Miller, the tow company owner, would provide the unclaimed vehicles to Carrillo, Flippo said in a news release. Many of the cars and trucks were sold by the officers, who kept other vehicles for personal use, prosecutors said. The FBI aided in the arrests. Carrillo was charged with conspiracy, bribery and accepting a bribe. Former chief Nick Baldiviez and Officer Mario Mottu were charged with embezzlement, while acting chief Bruce Miller -- Brian Miller's brother -- was charged with accepting a bribe. Brian Miller was charged with conspiracy to commit a crime. CNN affiliate KSBW spoke to the acting chief as he left court Tuesday. ""I'm completely surprised. Accept a bribe? I've never done that. I'm blown away, I did not know this was coming,"" said the chief, who, like the other officers, is on paid leave. Officers Mark Baker and Jaime Andrade were booked on other charges. The defendants will be arraigned Monday. KSBW reported that all seven had posted bail. The King City Police Department has only 17 officers. City Manager Michael Powers told KSBW that the police department's front office cannot remain open because so many officers were arrested. The Monterey County Sheriff's Department will help patrol the city, the news release said. Baldiviez was chief for nine years until last year, when he disappeared for months, according to the station. He then reappeared and announced his retirement in September. King City is in southern Monterey County in the Salinas Valley. Its economy centers on agriculture and food processing. About 88% of the city's 13,000 residents are Latino, and about one in five of the people there lives below the poverty line. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this story.","DA says officers would impound cars of people who couldn't pay release fees .

"Manila to Tacloban, the Philippines (CNN) -- The weather forecasters had warned that Hagupit was one of the most unpredictable storms in memory. Three of the world's leading weather agencies came up with three different paths for the storm as it slowly, but relentlessly, bore down on the Philippines packing winds in excess of 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph). For me, that unpredictability turned traveling from Manila to Tacloban from a routine 90-minute flight into a 31-hour slog. I needed to be there to cover the typhoon's impact on a town traumatized by the impact of Super Typhoon Haiyan last year. It looked pretty simple at the beginning. Jump on the Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong, head straight for domestic departures, where I would then board a flight to Tacloban -- a flight of little more than an hour. Except it wasn't. TYPHOON TRACKER: Follow Hagupit . Planes... 10:30 a.m. came and went with no sign of a boarding call. I began to meet other journalists waiting for the same flight who were equally at a loss as to what was happening. We were eventually approached by a Philippines Airlines manager, apologizing profusely. ""Technical difficulties"" had apparently grounded the aircraft but we were assured there would be another flight at 1.30 p.m. All other flights to different parts of the Philippines were on schedule, so we were confident about this next take-off time. But as the time approached, no boarding call came. A brief announcement informed us the flight was canceled because of continuing ""technical difficulties."" And so it went. Another airlines staff member presented us with new boarding passes for a 3.45 p.m. flight. Fifteen minutes before departure we were sitting patiently on the airport bus waiting to be taken out to the apron and it looked as if we would finally be on our way. But the bus didn't move. We sat for 30 minutes until another announcement of another delay. We trudged back to the boarding gate, very frustrated. Other routes were being discussed but all ferries had been canceled and the direct flight still looked the best bet. More than an hour later we learned that all flights were canceled because of the weather conditions in Tacloban. We appeared to be stuck where the story wasn't. Blades... And so to Plan B. A hasty conference call with the Hong Kong news desk and a new plan: Charter a light aircraft. Initial indications were good. A private operator thought they could get a few of us into Tacloban at first light Saturday. The final decision on weather conditions would be made at 4 a.m. At the appointed time the news came through: Conditions were too dangerous to risk it. Another call to Hong Kong and we decided that it could be possible to fly to Cebu and take the short hop to Tacloban by helicopter. I boarded my flight at 11 a.m. and was on the island inside the hour to be met by the helicopter crew. I knew I was in good hands when I met my pilot, retired military man Col. Andy Largo. His flying career included flying four former Philippine presidents around the country, as well as the late Pope John Paul II. He had already flown two sorties that morning to Tacloban but my anxieties grew as he described the flights. He was forced to touch down early on both journeys because of the conditions -- and they were growing worse by the hour. The biggest worry, he said, were strong wings that could literally break the rotor blades. If we encountered excessive winds he would reduce the flying speed and edge ahead, waiting for a break in the weather. I was his only passenger but he took along an engineer to help ""just in case."" I buckled into the front seat next to Col. Largo and off we went into a murky cloud-filled sky. It was surprisingly smooth. We flew at between 1,000 and 2,000 feet over a white-capped sea, towards increasingly thick clouds. Our pilot seemed unworried until we got to the tip of Leyte Island and the town of Beybey, which lies at the foot of a range of mountains separating us from Tacloban. One look at the cloud ahead and he tapped me on the arm and indicated the flight had come to an end. We put down on a playing field and I jumped out. And automobiles.. I was soon surrounded by a group of locals, who managed to rustle up a van. Ten minutes later we on the road driving along a virtually deserted road in heavy rain, towards the mountains and Tacloban. It took two hours to make the 100 kilometer (62 mile) journey. At 4 p.m., 31 hours after touching down in Manila, I finally arrived at my destination.","CNN's Andrew Stevens was trying to get to Tacloban ahead of Typhoon Hagupit .

"Detroit, Michigan (CNN) -- Dave Bing was once the kind of guy who might sing a little Motown in the shower, or even club-hop with actual Motown artists. What different times those were for the mayor of Detroit. Bing was born and raised in Washington but long ago built a life in the city symbolic of the country's rise and crash. He was drafted by the Detroit Pistons in 1966 and played with the team for nine seasons. After his basketball career ended, he returned to the city to launch an automotive supplier, Bing Group. He spent 29 years building the business, he said, and by 2008 he thought maybe it was time to retire. Wrong. Bing had once supported former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, but not after Kilpatrick tumbled deep into scandal that led to his resignation and a jail sentence. A small group of friends convinced Bing to run, he said, and he won the chance to finish Kilpatrick's term in 2009. Later that year, he secured a full term. Sports, Bing said, taught him how to work on a team, to understand skills and weaknesses. Business showed him how to find and grow talent, how to recognize his own skills and weaknesses. None of it could have prepared him to run Michigan's largest city. Bing hasn't announced yet whether he'll run for re-election next year. ""It was in much worse condition than I ever anticipated,"" Bing said of Detroit. ""We're working through the process as I speak, but it's probably the second most difficult job in this country behind the president."" Indeed, he's facing the threat of bankruptcy, stalemates with city council and hard, sometimes raucous talks with Detroit residents and city workers. This summer hecklers riled about city pay cuts shouted him down during a community meeting. One day later, Bing was calm, too busy to think long about chants and criticism. There's no time for it, he said. No time anymore to sing, no time for late nights on the town. There's hardly time to sleep, he said. But it doesn't change his belief in the city that fills his memory and dominates his thoughts. So, CNN asked Bing: In a city notorious for its troubles, what would you want visitors or residents to see? Here are some of his answers. Detroit's riverfront . ""We have something that's distinct from almost any city in the country,"" Bing says, a view across a waterway and into another country. ""It's beautiful,"" he said. Detroit's riverfront draws together public space, art and events, especially along the River Walk. Within a few years, he expects there to be more attractions, commerce and living space along the water. It's the Motor City, but the city needs to give more people more reasons to get out and walk, he said. Detroit Institute of Arts . High on Bing's list of must-sees for Detroit is a trip to the Detroit Institute of Arts, a 658,000-square-foot, 100-gallery museum founded in 1885. Its collection features American, African-American, European, African, Asian, Native American, Oceanic, Islamic and ancient art, as well as collections of modern and graphic art. ""I think the Detroit Institute of Arts is probably renowned worldwide,"" Bing said. Earlier this year, metro Detroit voters went for a property tax increase that will supply the museum with an estimated $23 million annually for 10 years. The funding is expected to help stabilize the museum's budget and dodge dramatic cuts to exhibitions, education and hours. The museum now offers free admission to residents of the three counties that approved the tax. ""Huge investments had been made in a lot of our cultural institutions,"" Bing said. Even as other parts of the city struggled, ""I think that's one thing we've held on to."" Motown Museum . When Bing moved to Detroit in the 1960s, he came as a basketball player, a celebrity of sorts. He slipped right in to the nightlife of the time, and that meant Motown. ""The athletes, we always thought we were entertainers, and the entertainers thought they were athletes,"" he said. ""We really got together quite often."" Smokey Robinson, the Temptations, the Four Tops, the Supremes -- he said he knew them all well. ""You fell in love with them because they were true entertainers,"" he said. He's too busy now to sing, but anybody who comes to town should know that history, he said. Some of it is kept up at the Motown Museum, a music-studio-turned-museum known as Hitsville, U.S.A., founded in 1985. ""People don't realize how Motown got started, where it got started. I mean, it was a little house,"" Bing said. ""For all the success they had out of that one little place, people need to see that."" Detroit's Tigers, Lions, Red Wings -- and Pistons? Bing is proud to call Detroit home to four professional sports teams -- the Tigers, Lions, Red Wings and Pistons. He loves the energy of a game, the pride teams bring to the city and the crowds in stadiums and restaurants. But as an NBA Hall of Famer who came to Detroit for basketball, he'd rather the Pistons move back to the city from their suburban home, the Palace of Auburn Hills. He didn't lay out a plan for how to make it happen, but he said it's a goal. ""My whole career in basketball was downtown, and I think that's where it belongs, and I'll do everything I can to try to get it back downtown,"" he said. The future . ""There are several very strong neighborhoods in our city,"" he said, the areas around Midtown and Detroit's downtown, especially. But he's optimistic about what comes next. Here's his prediction for what visitors and residents will see in a decade: . ""Instead of seeing the vast amount of empty land where there's nobody there, I think we've got to do some different things. Urban farming is something we've been talking about for some time. We will probably see some of that. ""We would see people living out in neighborhoods where there's only one or two homes. We're not going to see that. We're going to try to convince those people to move so there's density in all of our neighborhoods, so we can really look out for each other, we can help protect each other, we can bring people and families back together again like it used to be. Where we care for each other, where we support each other. That's the kind of city I see.""","NBA Hall of Famer Dave Bing became Detroit's mayor in 2009 .

"GAZA CITY (CNN)  -- Gaza's main hospital, already overloaded with Palestinians wounded in the week-long Israeli air assault, has reached critical mass, according to a Norwegian doctor volunteering at Shifa Hospital. A Palestinian father carries his wounded baby daughter into a hospital in Gaza City Sunday. ""The injured patients are mainly civilians, a lot of children with dreadful injuries,"" Dr. Erik Fosse told CNN on Monday, estimating that 20 percent of the more than 500 people dead were children. ""This figure is rising, and I think it has to do with the development of the war as it moves into the city,"" he added. After a weeklong series of air strikes, Israel launched a ground assault Saturday night. Palestinian medical officials said Israeli forces have killed 37 Palestinians -- both civilians and militants -- since moving into the territory. With those deaths, at least 507 Palestinians have been killed in the military operation, including about 100 women and children, officials said. In addition, 2,600 Palestinians have been injured, most of them civilians, officials said. ""We've had a steady stream (of patients) every day, but the last 24 hours has (been) about triple the number of cases,"" Fosse said late Sunday. Fosse said he estimated that about 30 percent of the casualties at Shifa -- Gaza City's main hospital -- on Sunday were children, both among the dead and wounded. The increase in casualties at Shifa followed Israel's ground incursion into Gaza. Fosse said 50 patients were ""severely wounded"" when an Israeli air strike hit a food market in Gaza City.  Watch Palestinians describe fearful life in Gaza » . ""We were operating in the corridors, patients were lying everywhere, and people were dying before they got treatment,"" he said. Most of the casualties were due to the air strikes that preceded the ground incursion. Other hospitals in Gaza could not treat the wounded because of a shortage of supplies and staff. Israel has said the military operation is a necessary self-defense measure after repeated rocket attacks from Gaza into southern Israel by Hamas militants. Israeli leaders say they are trying to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza. Last week, Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, a psychiatrist who runs Gaza's mental health program, said Gaza was headed for ""a major humanitarian disaster"" unless the fighting ended soon. Meanwhile, at the Gaza-Egypt border, nearly 25 trucks carrying aid and medical supplies were unable to pass through the Rafah border crossing on Sunday, CNN's Karl Penhaul reported. Egyptian authorities said the guards who were manning the Palestinian side of the border had abandoned their posts. Aid workers and drivers banged on the gate to protest the closure.  Watch ""absurd"" situation at border crossing » . An official with the humanitarian group World Vision also confirmed that report, saying: ""Unfortunately today, they closed the border, so no aid entered Gaza today."" ""There are food shortages ... The health system is overwhelmed. The people here don't have electricity,"" added Mohammed El-Halaby, program manager for World Vision, adding that several power lines and water pumps were damaged by last week's air strikes. On Saturday -- before Israel launched its ground incursion -- old Palestinian ambulances had carried the wounded across the border, where patients were loaded into modern ambulances. Most of those taken into Egypt were civilians, including a teenage boy with his arm blown off, as well as a 4-day-old baby, who was not injured but needed to be kept on a ventilator and in an incubator. iReport.com: Share reactions to the crisis in the Middle East .

"(CNN) -- The bodies of six men -- including a California educator -- were found Thursday in the north-central Mexican state of Durango, hours after they had been abducted from a nearby restaurant, the man's relatives said Friday. ""He was needlessly and senselessly murdered,"" said Carlos Salcedo, 37, about his brother, Augustin Roberto ""Bobby"" Salcedo, of El Monte, east of Los Angeles. Bobby Salcedo, 33, had traveled with his wife to visit her family in Gomez Palacio, his brother said. They were eating in a restaurant Wednesday night when armed men barged in, forced everyone onto the floor and abducted all six men who were in the party, Carlos Salcedo told CNN in a telephone interview. At 7 a.m. Thursday, police notified his sister-in-law that they had found her husband's body in a local ravine with bullet wounds to the head and chest, he said. ""All indications are that this was just random, a violent act, just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" he told reporters in El Monte. ""What we really want to do is just shed a light on this incident and the senseless, violent acts that are happening across the border from us and really just put a spotlight on this and make sure that we find justice."" ""He was a brilliant, a bright star for our community, and he as taken from us,"" said El Monte Mayor Andre Quintero of Salcedo, who served on the city school district board. ""He was stolen from us and now we need to hold them accountable for what they did."" A man who answered the phone at Gomez Palacio's Secretariat of Protection and Roads said no one was available Friday to discuss the matter. Violence in Mexico has been heightened in recent years by drug-related disputes. The country ended 2009 with a record number of drug-related deaths, exceeding the record tally reached in 2008, unofficial counts indicate. The government has not released official figures, but national media say 7,600 Mexicans lost their lives in the war on drugs in 2009. Mexican President Felipe Calderon said earlier this year that 6,500 Mexicans died in drug violence in 2008. The vast majority of the deaths have been among criminals, not civilians, Calderon and other Mexican officials have said repeatedly. Though the family has received no official word about whether the killing was related to drugs, ""We imagine it had something to do with it,"" Salcedo's sister, Griselda, said in a telephone interview. The siblings' father was a Mexican laborer in the 1950s who emigrated to the United States with his wife and made home in East Los Angeles. As their family grew, ""education was a number one priority,"" Carlos Salcedo said. ""Every single one of us went to university and graduated -- a bachelor's and four master's."" Roberto Salcedo, who was in the middle of his dissertation on educational leadership, took that a step further and was a doctoral candidate at UCLA, served on the El Monte elementary school board and worked as assistant principal at El Monte High School. Carlos Salcedo served on the high school board. When the soccer team of a high school where Roberto Salcedo had worked won a regional championship, ""he raised money to get them all championship rings"" at $500 apiece for 30 players, Carlos Salcedo said. Among his younger brother's legacy are former students who have gone on to become teachers in the school district, he said. And his focus on education has left an even stronger imprint on at least one former student. ""Somebody had posted on his Facebook, 'I'm going to finish my Ph.D. in your honor,' "" Salcedo said.","NEW: Body of Augustin Roberto Salcedo found in Durango with bullet wounds to head, chest .

"Washington (CNN) -- 'Tis indeed the season to be jolly for Americans, who are experiencing their lowest levels of holiday stress in years, according to a new CNN/ORC nationwide poll. The poll suggests they've already decked their halls with boughs of holly, as only 30% of the public said they're feeling a great deal or fair amount of stress from all the things they need to do to get ready for Christmas. RELATED: Read the entire CNN/ORC poll . That's a steep drop from 2005, when a vast majority of Americans must've left the tree-trimming to the last minute, as 86% said they felt a great deal or fair amount of stress that year. In 1989, 76% felt the same, perhaps because they waited too long to buy the new Nintendo Game Boy, the hot toy released that year. Americans may be feeling less stress this year in part because they're not dealing with the often messy hassle of putting up a natural tree, and the pressure to make sure far-flung extended family members get their Christmas cards in time. The survey found a slight majority of Americans -- 51% -- plan to have an artificial Christmas tree this year, up from just 39% in 1996. And only 58% of Americans planned to send holiday cards this year, down from 74% in 2006. But that doesn't mean Americans are losing their holiday spirit: 95% say they celebrate Christmas. But the country is split on whether observers view it more as a family holiday -- 47% -- or as a religious holiday, 46%. That's a shift from 1992, when a slight majority of Americans said Christmas was more of a religious celebration. For most Americans, the holiday moment to look forward to is Christmas Day -- that's when 58% of the nation opens their presents. A lucky 20% of the nation opens them both on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The poll also found Americans aren't as concerned as they used to be about a terrorist attack will hitting over the holidays. SEE ALSO: Harry Reid threatens to steal Christmas a lot . Now, just 39% say a terrorist attack is very or somewhat likely, down from more than half in 2010. The survey was conducted through live interviews of 1,011 adults nationwide via landlines and cell phones and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; no attempt was made to reach Santa Claus about his stress levels, which presumably peak this time of year.","Americans are experiencing lowest levels of holiday stress in years, a new CNN/ORC poll says .

"(CNN) -- Concerns about an impending terrorist strike are at the lowest point on record since the attacks of September 11, 2001, according to a new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll. Sixty percent of Americans thought a terrorist attack was likely after the first anniversary of 9/11. Furthermore, only about one in 10 Americans says terrorism is the most important issue in deciding their vote for president, the poll found. Seven years after the attacks of September 11, just 30 percent of Americans said they think an attack on American soil is likely over the next several weeks, down 11 points since this time last year and down 30 points since the first anniversary of September 11. Only 14 percent of Americans say an impending terrorist attack is likely in their community. And Americans do appear to be more confident that Osama bin Laden will eventually be captured or killed: Just about half say the U.S. will ultimately find the September 11 mastermind, up 7 points from this time last year. But in frustrating news for the White House, Americans appear to give little credit to President Bush for the lack of a terrorist strike over the last seven years: Only 37 percent believe that the president and his policies are the chief reason there has not been a strike on U.S. soil. Overall, he has a 28 percent approval rating, tying his all-time low in CNN/ORC polling.  Watch how the Pentagon is memorializing 9/11 » . Opinions on the war in Iraq, on the other hand, have changed slightly, with a slight majority (52 percent) now saying that the war is an essential part of the war on terrorism. That represents a shift from 2006, when a majority of Americans said the war in Iraq was a distraction. Support for the Iraq war is also up slightly over the past six months, from 30 percent in June to 37 percent now. But as Americans increasingly approve of the war, it becomes less of an important issue in their choice for president: Now, only 13 percent of registered voters said it was most important to their vote, compared with the 56 percent who named the country's economic woes as their chief concern. Just over 60 percent of Americans continue to oppose the conflict, however. Two-thirds want the next president to remove most U.S. troops from Iraq within a few months of taking office, numbers that appear to put Republican presidential candidate John McCain on the opposite side of most voters on that issue. ""The good news for John McCain is that most Americans think he would be better at handling terrorism than [Barack] Obama,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""The bad news is that terrorism seems to matter most to the people McCain already has squarely in his camp: Republicans. Just over 20 percent of Republicans say that terrorism is their number one issue; for Democrats and independents, that's in single digits.""","Poll: About 1 in 10 say terrorism is the most important issue in voting for president .

"(CNN) -- Colombian and Mexican drug cartels have jumped the Atlantic Ocean and expanded into West Africa, working closely with local criminal gangs to carve out a staging area for an assault on the lucrative European market. Authorities destroy cannabis found in Ivory Coast. West Africa is appealing to drug traffickers from Latin America. The situation has gotten so out of hand that tiny Guinea-Bissau, the fifth-poorest nation in the world, is being called Africa's first narco-state. Others talk about how Africa's Gold Coast has become the Coke Coast. In all, officials say, at least nine top-tier Latin American drug cartels have established bases in 11 West African nations. ""The same organizations that we investigate in Central and South America that are involved in drug activity toward the United States are engaged in this trafficking in Western Africa,"" said Russell Benson, the Drug Enforcement Agency regional director for Europe and Africa. ""There's not one country that hasn't been touched to some extent."" The calculus is simple: bigger profits in Europe than in the United States, less law enforcement in West Africa than in Europe. The driving force is the booming European market for cocaine. ""The exponential rise in the number of consumers has made Europe the fastest-growing and most-profitable market in the world,"" said Bruce Bagley, dean of the Graduate School of International Studies at the University of Miami. While the European market has been expanding, use in the United States has declined from its peak in the 1980s, the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime said in its 2009 annual report, issued in July. ""Cocaine use prevalence in the USA is 50 percent lower than it was two decades ago, while Spain, Italy, Portugal, France and the United Kingdom have all seen cocaine use double or triple in recent years,"" the U.N. report said. About 1,000 tons of pure cocaine are produced each year, nearly 60 percent of which evades law enforcement interception and makes it to market, the report said. That's a wholesale global market of about $70 billion. Criminals traffic about 250 tons to Europe each year, though not all of it makes it there, the U.N. said. The European market totals about $11 billion. About 27 percent of the cocaine that entered Europe in 2006 came from Africa, the United Nations said. Huge profits make Europe particularly attractive. Two pounds of uncut cocaine can sell for $22,000 in the United States but for $45,000 in Europe, analyst Ashley-Louise Bybee wrote in a policy journal this year. The Justice Department said the price in Europe can be three times more than in the United States. ""It's a significant market for them to exploit,"" Benson said. A strong euro and weaker dollar also make Europe attractive to traffickers because of favorable exchange rates. There's also the fact that the European Union recently issued a 500 euro note, currently equivalent to about $700. The largest U.S. denomination in circulation is the $100 bill. Traffickers prefer the large euro notes because they are easier to carry in large quantities. For example, Benson said that $1 million in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds, while $1 million in 500 euro notes weighs 3.5 pounds. ""It's a huge difference,"" he said. Though Europe is highly attractive to traffickers, it can have tight, Western-style security. So the Colombian and Mexican cartels have discovered that it's much easier to smuggle large loads into West Africa and then break that up into smaller shipments to the continent -- mostly Spain, the United Kingdom and France. West Africa is a smuggler's dream, suffering from a combination of factors that make the area particularly vulnerable. It is among the poorest and least stable regions in the world. Governments are weak and ineffective and, as a top DEA chief testified to the U.S. Senate this summer, officials are often corrupt. Law enforcement also is largely riddled with corruption. Criminal gangs are rampant. Foot soldiers can be recruited from a large pool of poor and desperate youth. ""It's a point of least resistance,"" Benson said. West Africa refers to Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. ""This area of the world is ripe,"" Bagley said. ""There has been very little attention paid to it. The United States is loath to give aid to these countries because they are corrupt."" U.S. authorities find themselves at a great disadvantage fighting cartels that have much more money and guns. The DEA has four offices -- in Egypt, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa -- to cover a continent that spans 11.7 million square miles and has nearly 1 billion people. ""It's a big place,"" Benson acknowledges, noting that there are 54 countries on the continent. Local police also are vastly outgunned. Guinea-Bissau offers an alarming example. ""The Judicial Police ... have 60 agents, one vehicle and often no fuel,"" analyst Bybee wrote in a journal called New Voices in Public Policy, published by the George Mason University School of Public Policy. ""As a result, when culprits are apprehended, they are driven in a taxi to the police station. They just recently received six sets of handcuffs from the U.K., which were badly needed. In the military, one rusty ship patrols the 350-kilometer (217-mile) coastline and 88 islands."" Even when criminals are caught, Bybee said, ""the near absence of a judicial system allows traffickers to operate unimpeded."" For example, she said, ""because the police are so impotent, the culprits are often held for just a few hours before senior military personnel suddenly attain extraordinary judicial powers to demand their release."" The few officials who stand up to the traffickers receive death threats or are killed. West Africa also is particularly attractive to traffickers because it is near ""the soft underbelly of Europe,"" said retired four-star Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who was drug policy director for President Clinton. Geography plays another role because West Africa is fairly close to the three South American nations that produce nearly all of the world's cocaine -- Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. Many of the shipments depart from Venezuela, which shares a 1,273-mile (2,050-kilometer) porous border with Colombia and is even closer to Africa. ""They go right dead-ass across the shortest route,"" McCaffrey said. Most of the cocaine shipments cross the Atlantic in large ""mother ships"" and then are off-loaded to small vessels near the coastline, the United Nations said. Small planes modified for overseas flight that can carry a 1-ton cargo also have been used. Most of those come from Venezuela, the United Nations reported. A report issued in July by the Government Accountability Office said traffickers use go-fast boats, fishing vessels and commercial shipping containers as the primary means of smuggling cocaine out of Venezuela. McCaffrey also noted the use of go-fast boats and special planes. DEA Assistant Administrator Thomas Harrigan testified before the Senate in June that authorities in Sierra Leone seized a cocaine shipment last year from a twin-engine aircraft marked with a Red Cross insignia. The flight originated in Venezuela, he said. The GAO report noted that ""U.S. government officials have observed an increase in suspicious air traffic originating in Venezuela."" In 2004, the report said, authorities tracked 109 suspect flights out of Venezuela. In 2007, officials tracked 178 suspicious flights. Then there's the crime connection in West Africa. ""Colombian and Venezuelan traffickers are entrenched in West Africa and have cultivated long-standing relationships with African criminal networks to facilitate their activities in the region,"" Harrigan told a Senate subcommittee on African affairs. ""These organizations don't operate in a vacuum,"" Benson said. ""They have to align themselves with West African criminal groups."" The cartels also have aligned themselves with terrorists, Harrigan said. ""The threat of narco-terrorism in Africa is a real concern, including the presence of international terrorist organizations operating or based in Africa, such as the regional threat presented by al Qaeda in the Lands of Maghreb,"" he said, referring to al Qaeda activists in North Africa. ""In addition, DEA investigations have identified elements of Colombia's Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia [FARC] as being involved in cocaine trafficking in West Africa."" Benson said the groups operating in Africa are ""primarily narcotics organizations"" but acknowledged that the Marxist FARC guerrillas in Colombia are a force to be dealt with. The rebels have waged war on the Colombian government for more than 40 years. ""The profit potential is such that the FARC is one of the largest cocaine-trafficking operations globally and is also a terrorist organization,"" he said. Bagley and McCaffrey see less evidence of terrorist connections with the traffickers in Africa, both using nearly identical language. ""I'd be really skeptical of those kinds of assertions,"" McCaffrey said. ""I'm quite skeptical about linkages between cartels and terrorists,"" Bagley said. ""The criminal groups seek profits. They're not interested in taking over governments."" Still, Bagley said, traffickers and terrorists may use some of the same criminal networks. Analysts note that the surge of cartel activity in West Africa is a fairly recent development. The U.N. report said it started around 2005. Bybee places it around 2006. McCaffrey, who was in the Clinton White House in the 1990s, said he saw the problem coming a long time ago. ""I've been warning people in Europe and Latin America starting 10 years ago where this issue was going to move,"" he said. ""The Europeans absolutely blew me off."" The U.N. report offers some hope, saying that cocaine seizures in Europe peaked in 2006 and topped out in West Africa in 2007. Overall seizures have declined since 2006, the report said. ""This trend appears to be continuing in 2009 and includes declines in the number and volume of seizures made in the region and in the number of air couriers coming from the region in Europe,"" the report concluded. For example, authorities seized 11 large shipments in Africa in 2007, four in 2008 and none so far this year. The report does not specify whether there are fewer shipments or smarter criminals avoiding detection. But if there is a decline, the DEA's Benson said he has not seen it. ""In the last three or four years, it's increased quite dramatically,"" he said. ""The Colombian organizations have been active there longer than that. In the last two years, we've also seen Mexican involvement in the area as well.""","Guinea-Bissau, fifth-poorest nation in the world, is called Africa's first narco-state .

"(CNN) -- Detroit elected Mike Duggan mayor Tuesday. And he's white. Of course, he has numerous qualifications for the job -- experience as a hospital CEO, county executive, former prosecutor, etc. -- but in a city where four of five residents are African-American and no Caucasian has held the city's highest office in almost four decades, the headline is that Duggan is white. The last white mayor to take the city's helm was former sheriff and prosecutor Roman Gribbs, who served from 1970 to 1974. Duggan, 55, will replace outgoing Mayor Dave Bing after defeating his opponent, Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon, by a margin of 55% to 45%, according to CNN affiliates WXYZ and WDIV. His campaign slogan was ""Every neighborhood has a future,"" and he ran on a platform of financial turnaround, crime reduction and economic development. He told the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday that his first priority will be cutting police response time. ""If you don't feel safe in this community, people don't want to live here and don't want to open a business here,"" he told the newspaper. He'll have his work cut out in a city the FBI says saw 15,011 violent crimes and 386 murders last year. It also has more than 30,000 vacant buildings, WDIV reports, a telling mark of the fiscal crisis through which the city is struggling. It filed for bankruptcy in July. Duggan may have to operate through consensus until at least September, as Gov. Rick Snyder in March appointed Kevyn Orr to serve as emergency manager for at least 18 months. While Duggan told WDIV he'd liked to ""shorten Kevyn Orr's stay,"" most of the authority in city matters lies with Orr while he's emergency manager. Snyder has said that will be until Detroit emerges from bankruptcy and repairs its finances. Duggan's campaign website touts his record of fiscal turnaround: As president and CEO of Detroit Medical Center, Duggan led the hospital to its first profit since 1997; as general manager of the SMART bus system, he eliminated the deficit and increased bus service by 50%; and as deputy Wayne County executive, he eliminated a $130 million deficit and assisted in creating 15 straight balanced budgets. The married father of two and former Wayne County prosecutor attended Detroit Catholic Central High School before graduating from the University of Michigan as an undergraduate and as a law student.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Consumers should be skeptical of health and weight-loss claims of the increasingly popular Brazilian fruit, acai, and the free trial offers that ask for their credit card information, a nonprofit health group said Monday. Companies selling acai fruits are under investigation after numerous consumer complaints. The Center for Science in the Public Interest said companies offering free trials of diet pills made with the acai berries have bilked thousands of consumers using fake celebrity endorsements and blogs to lure customers. Consumers are asked to provide a credit card to pay shipping and handling charges, but begin almost immediately receiving $80 to $90 monthly charges. Thousands of consumers have had trouble stopping those charges once they canceled the free trial offer. Acai (pronounced a-sigh-EE) comes in a number of forms including juice, pulp, powder and capsule. The berry has been touted as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and an antibacterial. The fruit is said to contain Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, which are essential to human health. Claims of weight loss are unfounded, said the CSPI. ""There's no evidence whatsoever to suggest that acai pills will help shed pounds, flatten tummies, cleanse colon, enhance sexual desire, or perform any of the other commonly advertised functions,"" according to the organization's press release. Acai's popularity has surged on bogus marketing claims, said Jonny Bowden, a certified nutrition specialist and author of several health books. ""Virtually every berry -- blueberry, strawberry, goji, acai -- are anti-inflammatory and high in antioxidants,"" Bowden said.  ""This particular one is exotic. It's found in Brazil. It's been marketed to have more of a magic ingredient. It's been over-hyped and marketed to death. There are claims to curing cancer, curing baldness that is all over the place."" Like most berries, acai has good nutritional qualities, but ""there is not a drop of research"" that supports marketing claims that it prevents weight gain and facial wrinkles, Bowden said. Acai juices sell for as much as $40 per bottle. ""The expensive acai berry is triumph of marketing over science, that's the bottom line,"" Bowden said.  ""It's not useless, but it's not anything that people are claiming it is."" Companies including FWM Laboratories of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Hollywood, Florida, Advanced Wellness Research of Miami Beach, Florida, and other acai companies are accused of using fake diet blogs to steer consumers to sites plugging the free trials. After a doctor listed acai as a healthy food on the Oprah Winfrey show last year, and a guest on Rachael Ray's cooking show mentioned the fruit, ads popped up directing consumers to sites selling acai weight loss products as if endorsed by the celebrities. Winfrey and Ray have publicly disassociated themselves from those sites. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is investigating numerous complaints and said a lawsuit against FWM Laboratories is very likely. According to the Better Business Bureau, FWM Laboratories received an F rating, the BBB's worst. Other acai companies with the BBB''s F rating include Advanced Wellness Research, AcaiBurn, FX Supplements and SFL Nutrition. ""There are no magical berries from the Brazilian rain forest that cure obesity, only painfully real credit card charges and empty weight loss promises,"" Blumenthal said. ""Aggressive acai berry pitches on the Internet entice countless consumers into free trials promising weight loss, energy and detoxification. These claims are based on folklore, traditional remedies and outright fabrications unproved by real scientific evidence."" Keri Gans, dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, recommends that customers turn to fruits and vegetables at their local produce markets. ""If you're going on the Internet to find them and paying shipping fees, you should go to a market and buy local vegetables and fruits,"" she said.  ""It'd be a lot less expensive."" Acai berries could be part of a well-balanced diet of different fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Gans said consumers should be skeptical whenever any one food seems too good to be true and should not rely on one ""miracle food"" to boost health. ""If [people] hope to find answers in one food for longevity, I would say they're mistaken,"" she said.","Companies offering free trials of acai pills accused of bilking consumers .

"(CNN) -- George Carlin was ""the total package of what a comedian's skills could be,"" Jerry Seinfeld said Monday in a ""Larry King Live"" tribute to the comedian. ""He was a brilliant writer, a brilliant performer,"" Seinfeld told CNN's Larry King. ""He literally could train his eye on something very kind of mundane and regular -- he could talk about a couch pillow or he could take on, you know, abortion or politics or religion. ""So there was no subject that his mind was not able to dissect and make fun. ... He had an amazing breadth of subject matter,"" Seinfeld added, calling Carlin ""one of the Mount Rushmore guys in our profession."" Carlin, who died of heart failure Sunday at age 71, was known for his observational skills and talent for language. His famous routines compared baseball and football, fast-moving ""maniac"" drivers with slow-moving ""idiots,"" and included a list of ""people I can do without.""  Slideshow: The life of George Carlin » . He also fearlessly used profanity, scatology and irreverence in making his points about the absurdities of human life. His ""Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television"" routine prompted a landmark indecency case that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In November, Carlin was slated to receive the 2008 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, given by the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.  Watch Carlin discuss ""Napalm and Silly Putty"" » . ""I think the things he said and the guts he had to say them, it was just breathtaking,"" comedian Roseanne Barr told King. ""He really didn't care, you know, if it was going to rub anybody the wrong way,"" observed Seinfeld, who credited Carlin as a huge influence. ""I used to love this routine he would do about how whenever the UFO people come on television, everyone in this studio audience laughs at them. But when they talk about religion and the man in the sky with the white beard and the robe, everyone is very reverent and which one is really more absurd? And, you know, obviously, that's going to get religious people upset."" Bill Maher, who as the host of ""Politically Incorrect"" and HBO's ""Real Time With Bill Maher"" has raised hackles himself from time to time, noted that Carlin probably would have dismissed much of the praise he was receiving in death. ""I bet you if he was here now, what he would be saying is, 'Why do people say nice things when you die? That's the stupidest thing to do. They can't hear you, you know?' "" Maher said. But Maher added that, for him, ""there's nobody higher"" in the comedy pantheon. ""Look, there's many ways to get a laugh. To me, this is the highest way. It's also saying something,"" Maher said. ""If you took the jokes out of his act, it would still be a very interesting speech that made you think."" Carlin may have seemed angry and indignant onstage -- and there was that side of him, the comedians agreed -- but he was personally a kind, gracious man, said ""The Daily Show"" contributor Lewis Black. When Black was a struggling performer, he recalled getting a call from Carlin, a man he'd never met, out of the blue. ""He said, 'Listen, Lewis, this is George Carlin. First, let me tell you, there's nothing I can do for your career.' And then he went on to say he'd heard my stuff, and he really liked it and I made him laugh,"" Black said. ""If I had any things to send it to him, because he had friends who liked to laugh. That was what he could do. That alone really was for me, it was huge, absolutely huge. ""It shut my mother up,"" he added. Carlin's daughter Kelly Carlin McCall called her father ""a great dad."" ""People see him onstage in his stage persona and his grumpiness and crotchetiness,"" she said. ""Yet he was the kindest, most generous, incredible man when it came to meeting people one-on-one and knowing people."" The family is planning a private memorial for this weekend, McCall and Carlin's brother Patrick told King. That service will be followed by a public event in a few weeks.  Watch an appreciation of Carlin » . The comedians and family members were caught off guard by Carlin's death. Though Carlin was in the preliminary stages of congestive heart failure, his health had seemed in ""a good place,"" McCall said. The peripatetic Carlin, who constantly toured despite a history of heart problems, had played a show the weekend before in Las Vegas, Nevada. Seinfeld said he had talked with Carlin a few days ago, not long after the death of ""Meet the Press"" host Tim Russert. ""We were actually joking about death,"" he said. ""We were kidding about how, you know, they kind of come in groups. It was like Bo Diddley and Tim Russert. And he was saying how I feel safe now for a little while because, you know, there should be a lull before they come after the next person."" Seinfeld marveled at Carlin's output. ""This guy did 14 HBO specials -- 14. I've done two. And, you know, very few comedians do more than three or four -- I mean, plus the books,"" he said. ""I don't think we'll ever see someone who, in their lifetime, creates as much comedy as this man did."" Patrick Carlin, who described his relationship with his younger brother as ""two peas in a pod,"" said ""he was born hip and never stopped growing,"" never forgetting those he loved. ""He sure left a beautiful trail across the universe,"" he said. ""And I'm going to miss him forever, forever, man.""","Jerry Seinfeld: George Carlin ""one of the Mount Rushmore guys"" in comedy .

"(CNN) -- Doing your holiday shopping online is generally preferable to braving the season's frantic mall crowds, slow moving checkout lines and tiresome holiday background music. But don't get too relaxed. There are still some security precautions everyone should take before sharing payment information online. Increasingly, people are using their smartphones and tablets for online shopping. There was a 190% in mobile purchases this year on Cyber Monday, and 193% jump on Black Friday, according to mobile payments company PayPal. The shift to mobile presents its own unique security challenges, including malware apps and text phishing scams. Here are online shopping security tips to keep in mind all year round, on all your devices. Check for ""HTTPS"" Not all webpages are equally secure. Before entering any personal or payment information, make sure to look up at your browser bar. The URL should start with HTTPS, not HTTP. That one letter on the end, S, is the difference between a secure site and an unsecured site. Bing takes on Google in fight for holiday shoppers . A secondary thing to look for is the small lock icon in your address bar. This lock indicates that you have an SSL (secure sockets layer) connection. The icon is standard for most popular browsers, including Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari and Firefox. On mobile devices, the address bar is tinier and easier to overlook. Do a little pinch-and-zoom to locate the S before sharing your payment information. Watch your WiFi . Shopping from mobile devices means an increased chance you'll be on an unfamiliar WiFi network. ""Only window shop on public WiFi,"" recommends Derek Halliday, lead security product manager at Lookout, a mobile security company. Holiday shoppers share tips for buying American . Avoid entering your credit card number or other private information when you're on an unsecured, public WiFi connection where people could snoop. Wait until you are back at home or work. Vet the vendors and apps . The Internet is packed with stores, some reputable and others downright shady. While bargain hunting, it can be tempting to make your purchase from the site offering the lowest price, but take a moment to research any vendors you're not familiar with. ""If something seems to good to be true, it probably is,"" says Claudia Lombana, a PayPal shopping specialist. Before you hand over your payment information, do a quick search for reviews of the vendor. Calculate the total cost of an item, including shipping and tax, when determining the lowest price. The same tips apply when you're using a mobile app. Only download apps for your smartphones and tablets through official stores, like the App Store for iOS or Google Play for Android. The occasional unsavory app has been known to slip through these proper channels. Always check the reviews in the app stores to see what other users have to say. If there are bunch of one star reviews or warnings, don't download the software. Another option is to download a mobile security app to scan new software and links. Beware of phishing, SMiShing and other scams . By now most people know to keep an eye out for phishing scams -- e-mails disguised as legitimate companies or organizations that ask for payment or password information. But every now and then, one comes along that looks incredibly convincing. To be safe, copy and paste all links into a fresh browser window instead of clicking on the hyperlink, check the originating email address and when in doubt, contact the company to verify the e-mail. SMiShing (a lovely portmanteau of ""SMS"" and ""Phishing"") has taken off recently, catching people off-guard who don't expect to receive this type of spam as a text message. Earlier this year, scammers sent texts telling people they had won a $1,000 gift card from Walmart. The texts linked to a page that asked for credit card information to cover the cost of shipping the prize. As a general rule, legitimate companies will never ask for your private information over email or text message, including payment information, usernames, passwords, mother's maiden name or social security number. Password protect mobile devices . This was the number one mobile tip from the experts we talked to: turn on the passcode on your phone or tablet. It's an easy and important precaution, but only 54% of Americans do it. Yes, it will take a few more seconds to access your email or open an app, but smartphones often contain more valuable information than what's in your wallet. ""Many shopping apps archive your credit card information after your make a first purchase, and many apps don't require that you enter your password every time you use it,"" explained Halliday. If your phone or tablet is lost or stolen, anyone can access the wealth of data you have stored on your device. Even if individual apps require passwords, someone can use your email and phone number to try and reset them. Update often . Many operating system and application updates address security issues, plugging holes and fixing errors that could be exploited by hackers. On your computer, update the operating system when prompted, and make sure you're running the latest version of your browser. For mobile devices, the routine is easier because the apps come through a central app store. You can see exactly what mobile apps need updating at a glance. Use a credit card instead of a debit card . Credit cards are a more secure online payment option than your debit card. The majority of credit cards offer purchase protection in case your card number is stolen, or if you make a payment at an online store that delivers a bad product, or no product at all. We know you're very busy this time of year, but also take an extra moment to comb over your statements. Should any of these security precautions fail, you'll want to catch suspicious charges as soon as possible.","Check your address bar for ""https"" before entering payment information .

"(CNN) -- I met Shannon last year when she had just arrived in Los Angeles from her hometown of Salt Lake City with her 10-month-old baby. I was surprised to learn why she left the predominantly Mormon state known for its clean, healthy lifestyle to move to a city known for life's excesses. The young mother said she was trying to escape from what she called ""an epidemic."" She said that Utah ""was drowning in prescription pill addiction."" Shannon divulged that she had actually been abusing heroin for some time, but -- as with most people with addiction problems in Utah -- it all started with pills. Out of all 50 states, Utah ranks eighth in the number of prescription drugs overdose deaths, according to Susannah Burt with the state's Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health. And, despite a dip in 2008, the number of pill-related deaths in Utah over the past decade has increased by 400%, according to Burt. I have always thought Utah had low levels of addiction because of the influence of its large Mormon population -- more than 60% of those living there are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I've even known Mormons there who don't drink coffee in deference to their religion's ""Word of Wisdom,"" a health law that strongly discourages people from consuming things that are harmful to their bodies. You'd have to be hiding under a rock to not know how highly addictive prescription pills can be. And people in Utah, who have statistically speaking been successful at maintaining healthier lives, are no less vulnerable. In fact, because medications are prescribed by a physician, the assumption often is that they're OK. Many people who've been able to maintain diligence in upholding the LDS Word of Wisdom have fallen victim to pill addiction because of the gray area that doctor-prescribed pills inhabit. While the Mormon church hierarchy certainly isn't proud of the exploding numbers, it didn't hide from the issue, giving us access to talk to those dealing with the struggles of addiction. Earlier this year, we spent 12 days in Utah with church leaders and people in recovery as well as people deep in the throes of addiction. I met people who wore their hearts on their sleeves who shared some of their most painful moments. They allowed me into their worlds because they acknowledge pill addiction is a huge problem within their community and they know they need help. The people I spent time with are incredibly brave -- particularly Shannon who I'm happy to report has been clean for quite awhile now. I will always be grateful for their courage in sharing their stories.","Utah has seen a dramatic increase in pill-related deaths .

"(CNN) -- Forget everything you know about what's making us fat. We hear a lot about Americans being fast food-addicted couch potatoes, and while that does play a role in the nation's expanding waist lines, a new study concludes it's not the driving force behind the obesity epidemic. Instead all Americans -- no matter what income level they have and no matter what neighborhood they live in -- are getting bigger because food is cheaper than ever before, the study authors say. Simply put, we're spending less of our total budget on food so we're buying more. The study, published in the June edition of the journal CA Cancer, found that people in 1930 spent about a fourth of their disposable income on food. Today food takes up about a tenth of our disposable income. Food is also easier to prepare and easier to purchase than it was in 1930. That means Americans aren't just eating more high-calorie food, they are eating more of a variety of foods. Consequently, Americans have consumed, on average, about 20% more calories since the 1970s. Lead study authors Roland Sturm and An Ruopeng hope it will lay to rest some myths about obesity. He lost 125 pounds, but still felt fat . ""If you look at the data over time, you actually see a slight increase in exercise. And Americans have more access to fruits and vegetables,"" said Roland Sturm who is a senior economist at the RAND Corporation. ""It's not Southern hospitality that is driving this trend, nor is it income or education. Really nothing protects us from this challenge of obesity."" On average, Americans have been getting fatter since at least the 1950s, maybe even longer. While the data isn't perfect, experts looking at health records for men between the ages of 40 and 49 see a steady increase in body mass index since 1900. Obesity isn't only a problem for people who want to wear bikinis to the beach. Excess body fat can raise a person's risk for heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke and chronic illnesses. ""What this article reinforces is that we need to continue our research to find what combination of strategies will be most effective long term in helping all of us live healthier lives,"" said Colleen Doyle, director of nutrition and physical activity for the American Cancer Society. Doyle suggests a better built environment where it is easy for people to engage in physical activity -- meaning sidewalks and bike lanes and safer streets. Also helpful would be changing social norms so that families will expect healthier school meals and calorie counts are readily available on restaurant menus. ""No one thing is the solution to this problem we are having,"" Doyle said. Can you really control where you lose fat? This latest study points out a few positives. Americans are exercising more: Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show an uptick in the number of people who say they get 30 minutes of moderate exercise five or more days a week, or 20 minutes of vigorous activity on three or more days (about 51% in 2009, compared to 46% in 2001). The availability of fresh produce has also increased over the last 40 years, with a 27% increase in fresh fruit and a 21% increase in fresh vegetables per capita from 1970 to 2010. But the number of people who actually eat fruits and vegetables has stayed flat. That may be one area where public policy could help. Agriculture policy ""has a huge impact on what people eat,"" said study co-author An Ruopeng. ""Maybe instead of promoting commodity food like corn and soy, we could instead incentivize small farms to grow more fruits and vegetables."" ""We don't want food to become really expensive again; that is not the answer,"" said Sturm. ""The markets were successful in solving a really old problem"" of food scarcity. ""Now we have a new problem in the works with obesity, so we may need the market forces now to nudge in a different direction."" How to break your junk food addiction . Sturm believes a policy South Africa has tried may help. In some 800 supermarkets in the African country, healthy foods were subsidized and available at a 25% discount. The price did ""nudge people in the right direction"" to eat healthier. A tax on sugary foods and sodas in Mexico was also introduced last year, but experts are still waiting to see what impact that policy will have on eating habits. Here in the United States, some members of Congress have introduced similar taxes, but haven't been able to get them passed. It will take more than public policy to end the obesity epidemic, the study authors say. ""There is no silver bullet,"" Sturm said. True change would have to come from the ground up.

"(CNN) -- Andrew ""Goofy"" Saunders is like no stripper you've ever seen before. For one, he's built like a wrestler with a rainbow afro that ""Krusty the Clown"" could only dream of. For two, his stage is a hurtling train. And for three -- this is the clincher -- the only item of clothing he's likely to shed is his baseball cap. But boy, does this 20-year-old from the Bronx know how to dance around a pole. ""We tell people we're part time strippers,"" he says over the phone, the sound of cars blaring in the background of his native New York. ""It's just a little joke, it gets people to laugh."" ""We call it Lite Feet"" Saunders is the founder of WAFFLE (We are Family for Life Entertainment), a group of 15 dancers whose gravity-defying pole pirouettes -- accompanied by thumping beatbox tunes -- have earned them quite a reputation on the city's subway. Every week the young men -- aged between 17 and 21 -- perform their special brand of breakdancing turned ballet on the underground trains; delighting, bemusing, and sometimes infuriating commuters. The urban acrobats swing from handrails or backflip down aisles, with the ease and bravado of youngsters who grew up using the city as a giant dance floor. ""Chicken Noodle Soup,"" ""Needle and Thread,"" ""Walking on Air"" -- these are the names of some of WAFFLE's signature moves, performed with a cheeky swagger to their own mish-mash recordings of hip hop, funk, and electro beats. ""The way we move -- our energy, our shoe tricks, our hat tricks -- is something that's completely new,"" said Saunders. ""We call it 'Lite Feet' -- it's a mixture of dances put together,"" he added. ""There's this dance, the 'Charleston' (made popular in the 1920s), and that's one of the closest things we've been able to find to it."" ""Everyone has an opinion"" ""It's showtime!"" has become something of a rallying cry for the buskers, who usually split into smaller groups of three, targeting the busiest carriages to earn up to $100 a day. Watch one of the many YouTube clips of the dancers expertly twirling their caps on a perfectly poised elbow or nonchalantly ""Moonwalking"" along a trundling train, and the reactions are as varied as New Yorkers themselves -- grandmothers cheer, hipsters appear bored, and tourists scramble for their phones. ""There are a lot of copycats out there now,"" says Saunders, who first started busking seven years ago. ""Everyone has an opinion. But this is how we make a living, so we don't have to ask our parents for money or have a boring job. We're just trying to do something positive."" Not everyone sees their shows in the same light, with a New York Times article on the troupe attracting some unfavorable comments. ""They definitely have some impressive moves. They are also extremely annoying, and more importantlyâ€”dangerous,"" wrote Josh F. Has Saunders ever hurt anyone during his act? ""No. Just a little graze, but I've never really hit anyone,"" he said. ""People don't know I've been doing it for years. I know what I'm doing."" From Bronx to big time? It was as young teens growing up in low income households in Harlem, Brooklyn and the Bronx, that Saunders and his fancy-footed friends first came up with the idea of busking as a way to raise money to attend local dance competitions -- or ""battles."" ""You had to pay $10 to get in, so asking your mom every week got annoying. Or they probably won't have the money to give to you right away."" ""We had an idea to go on the train and make the money ourselves. And the money was good -- we made over the amount we needed. So we just kept on going."" The troupe has since appeared in various video clips and mini documentaries, with member ""Kid the Wiz"" even taking his deft hat tricks and comedic style across the country on ""America's Got Talent."" ""My main goal is to get off the train and work with more people,"" said Saunders. ""I want to bring Lite Feet to the world.""","Teens perform gravity-defying dance moves on New York's subway .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in some Afghan prisons are torturing detainees into confessions, using methods that meet the international definition of torture, according to a new U.N. report. The practices documented ""are among the most serious human rights violations under international law, are crimes under Afghan law and are strictly prohibited under both Afghan and international law,"" the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) says in the report. ""Detainees described experiencing torture in the form of suspension (being hung by the wrists from chains or other devices attached to the wall, ceiling, iron bars or other fixtures for lengthy periods) and beatings, especially with rubber hoses, electric cables or wires or wooden sticks and most frequently on the soles of the feet. Electric shock, twisting and wrenching of detainees' genitals, stress positions including forced standing, removal of toenails and threatened sexual abuse were among other forms of torture that detainees reported. ""Routine blindfolding and hooding and denial of access to medical care in some facilities were also reported. UNAMA documented one death in government custody due to torture in April 2011, the report says. The report contains quotes from various prisoners, not identified by name, describing their experiences in detail. The report comes from interviews with 379 pre-trial detainees and convicted prisoners at facilities operated by different branches of the Afghan government between October 2010 and August 2011. The Afghanistan government responded that the report ""is to some extent not close to reality"" and ""not entirely in compliance with the facts."" ""Torture methods such as electric shock, threat of rape, twisting of sexual organs etc. are methods that are absolutely non-existent in the NDS (National Directorate of Security),"" the government said. But the government added that the report may help draw attention to needed improvements. ""Despite their cruel and barbaric acts,"" terrorists are being treated ""humanely and in accordance with the law,"" the Afghan government said, in a response included in the UNAMA report. ""Beginning from their arrest and investigation to the final verdict of the court they are treated in accordance with the Islamic and humanitarian norms."" UNAMA said officials with Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security ""systematically tortured detainees in a number of detention facilities across Afghanistan. Torture does not appear to have been practiced systematically in each NDS facility UNAMA observed."" ""UNAMA's detention observation report found compelling evidence that 125 detainees (46%) of the 273 detainees interviewed who had been in NDS detention experienced interrogation techniques at the hands of NDS officials that constituted torture,"" the report said. Nearly all the detained reported that the abuse was during interrogations and aimed at obtaining a confession or information. ""In almost every case, NDS officials stopped the use of torture once detainees confessed to the crime of which they were accused or provided the requested information."" Torture was used on some children under 18, the report said. UNAMA recommended that the NDS and the police take immediate steps to prevent torture and allow regular, unhindered access for independent monitors. The report also called on the government and the supreme court to take action. Countries with troops in Afghanistan should suspended transfer of detainees to facilities ""where credible allegations or reports of torture and ill treatment have been made pending a full assessment,"" the report said. Canada and the United Kingdom ceased transfers of detainees to facilities in Kandahar and Kabul at various times based on reports of torture and ill treatment, the report said. And in July of this year, the United States and NATO'S International Security Assistance Force stopped transferring detainees to authorities in certain areas based on reports of consistent torture and mistreatment, the report said. UNAMA took steps to ensure that the information it collected was credible, the report said. It ""rigorously analyzed patterns of allegations in the aggregate and at specific facilities which permitted conclusions to be drawn about abusive practices ... and suggested fabricated accounts were uncommon."" ""The nationwide pattern of allegations is inconsistent with a substantial proportion of detainees interviewed having been trained before their detention in what lies to tell about their treatment if detained."" In its response, the government said it ""is committed to observe the whole enforced laws of the country; international human rights treaties; the Convention against Torture and approved articles and put to use all its efforts towards their realizations."" It added, ""Maybe there are deficiencies with a country stricken by war and a wave of suicide attacks and other terroristic crimes, we do not claim perfection and that we are doing things 100% in accordance with how things should be. Some of these deficiencies, however, are due to a lack of experience within our staff and their lack of access to proving equipments and facilities and in part due to isolated incidents of individual violations. We are happy that this report also testifies in a part that torture did not take place in a systematic manner in all NDS headquarters."" It also noted that organizers of attacks use children in their plots, and that ""most of the anti-government elements do not hold ID cards which makes it challenging for NDS to identify underage individuals... Once it is confirmed that the arrested person is underage, NDS immediately transfers him/her either to the Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre or Juvenile Prosecution Office to investigate the case.""","NEW: Such practices are ""absolutely non-existent"" in the National Directorate of Security, the government says .

"(CNN) -- There's Michael Sam, the football player. And Michael Sam, the man who could soon become the National Football League's first openly gay player. Speaking Saturday at the NFL Combine, the University of Missouri star defensive end said he wished reporters would think of him in the former terms and ask him about schemes, his performance and his potential. ""But,"" Sam conceded, ""it is what it is."" And so Sam patiently fielded question after question that, directly or indirectly, related to his sexuality and topics such as gay slurs, bullying and more. The All-American defensive lineman from the University of Missouri publicly revealed that he's gay in an ESPN interview that aired on February 9. The revelation stirred a flurry of talk and debate about whether pro football players would accept a homosexual teammate, and whether Sam's announcement could hurt his chances of being drafted and ultimately making a team. ""I understand how big this is,"" Sam said then. ""It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL."" The NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis marks a chance for Sam, like any other prospect, to be evaluated and answer questions from representatives from the league's 32 clubs. While it started as a behind-the-scenes affair, the combine has transformed into a big event that's even broadcast extensively for millions of fans to track. Facing the media is part of that process. In his opening comments, Sam -- who has since spoken to many other news outlets besides ESPN -- lightly said that he'd ""shown you guys enough the last couple of weeks. But I'm learning, with the media, that you guys want more."" So the questions came, like how he felt about gay slurs flying around among teammates. Sam responded that he'd ""been in locker rooms with all kinds of slurs (being) said,"" but didn't take it personally believing that those players using such language were probably ""a little naive."" But going forward, he expects this to become less of an issue. ""As time goes on,"" Sam said, ""everyone will adapt."" What about joining the Miami Dolphins, which -- according to recently released Wells Report -- had been marred by harassment, offensive language and more involving its offensive line? If Miami drafted him, Sam said he would be ""excited,"" not fearful. ""I'm not afraid about going into that (kind of) environment,"" he added. ""I know how to handle myself, I know how to communicate with my teammates, I know how to communicate with the coaches and the staff -- whomever I need to communicate with."" Repeatedly, Sam talked about his future in the NFL as a player, as much as being a gay role model. After all, this past season, he was named the top defensive player in the Southeastern Conference, considered the nation's best league. And teammates named him Missouri's most valuable player. Still, there's no doubt that Sam has become a national figure not because of his play, but because he came out. Not all of the attention has been good, like reports that some teams might avoid drafting him now and that he might not be welcomed in NFL locker rooms. Still, Sam insisted Saturday, ""the positive outweighs the negative."" He gave special thanks to members of the Missouri community -- stating ""I am M-I-Z-Z-O-U, I'm a Tiger forever"" -- while also expressing appreciation for many more people who he's never met. ""I'm kind of surprised, actually,"" Sam said. ""There's a lot of support, there's a lot of people who want this.""","Michael Sam talks to reporters at the NFL Scouting Combine .

"(CNN) -- They don't call it ""Twi Crack"" for nothing. Lisa Hansen, for example, thought she had lost her mind the first time she read ""Twilight."" Partly because she's 36. ""I was absolutely worried that something was wrong with me,"" the Utah mother of two said. ""I just couldn't put it down -- I was obsessed completely."" She picked up the first of Stephenie Meyer's vampire novels -- recommended by a teen neighbor -- with few expectations. After devouring it, she couldn't get the images of doomed love between a vegetarian vampire, Edward, and an awkward teenage girl, Bella, off her mind. Hansen thought about the books so much she seriously wondered if she was experiencing some sort of midlife crisis. ""I thought I was the only woman in the world who was my age and was just obsessed with books,"" she said. In reality, far from it. Hansen is just one of the thousands of women around the world who have gotten caught up in the vampire frenzy. While they resemble the youthful, squealing ""Twilight"" fans on occasion -- Kellan Lutz, who plays vampire Emmett Cullen in the films, admitted some of the mail he gets from older fans makes him blush -- they're still not the typical fan girls. For starters, being so in love with ""Twilight"" when you're ""of a certain age"" can come with a healthy dose of shame. ""The stigma of it being a teenager's book was the biggest issue,"" Hansen said. ""Everyone felt the same way I did, like, 'What's wrong with me? Why am I obsessing over this teenager thing?' "" But, one by one, the women began to find each other online, relieved that they weren't the only ones. ""As grown women we know that we never forget our first love, the first time our heart was really broken,"" Hansen explained of the often indescribable pull of Meyer's work. ""I just think that so many women can kind of identify with the experiences and emotions and underlying message of how difficult it is to make choices in life."" Since so many of ""Twilight"" fan sites were overrun with teenagers, adult women have erected their own digital havens for fans who could take only so much of the ""OMG Edward's so hot!!!"" reaction to ""Twilight."" There's Hansen's Twilight Moms Web site, which she started for married women and mothers who want to revel in their ""Twilight"" fandom, and sites like 49-year-old Patricia Kopicki's, which is for any adult ""Twilight"" fan, parent or not. Both of them say they get steady streams of messages from women thanking them for helping them come out of their ""Twilight"" closet. ""Many of us [fans] are happily married with kids, some as old as the male leads in 'Twilight.' Some of them jokingly refer to themselves as 'cougars' because of this, but it's used as a humorous way of saying we realize we are old enough to be Robert Pattinson's mother [and] we still find him attractive,"" Kopicki said. The cougar comes out of the closet . Historically, any woman nearing menopause was expected to be at home, raising kids and uninterested in sex, said Valerie Gibson, who claims credit for the concept of the ""cougar."" ""I wrote a book about older women and younger men in 1990, and let me tell you, the world was not ready for older women having sex with younger men,"" Gibson said. ""Older women have always been indoctrinated to believe that they would get to a certain age and they were no longer wanted and sexy and desired. I think older women who have found their sexuality have always lusted after younger men but they were never, never allowed to say so."" She hopes the love and lust many of these women display for the ""Twilight"" characters and the much younger actors who play them will turn the stereotype on its head. ""We've got a whole new social phenomenon of older women saying, 'Who told me sexuality would die? It hasn't! Here it is still burning away, maybe not for the guy I've been with for 30 years, but it's still there,' "" Gibson said. ""They're embracing it now."" Indeed, the ""Twilight"" fans are very aware of the age gap between themselves and the objects of their oft-sexy fantasies, and, when given the space to express it, they aren't the least bit ashamed. Jenny, a 32-year-old financial administrator who runs an adults-only ""Twilight"" blog mature enough to make her shy away from providing a last name, said women have thanked her for being so openly crass about her love of ""Twilight"" because it frees them to express desires in a way they wouldn't in real life. ""We love to talk about how sexy Rob Pattinson is and what we would do if we got close,"" she said. ""We feed off each other -- we can be these racy, silly, just kind of goofy women about this. No one's being judged for being married and saying, 'I'm 54 and I think this 23-year-old is absolutely delicious.' "" Jenny, who runs the ""Twitarded"" site from New Jersey with her 41-year-old friend Debbie, said the books and movies have given her a new creative outlet. ""I get excited over things that I never have before,"" Jenny said. ""I've never followed celebrities before and all of a sudden I'm talking about E! Online and Access Hollywood, and my boyfriend is like, 'You don't even watch TV.' "" If Robert Pattinson is on, she does now -- and her boyfriend doesn't mind. Neither does Debbie's husband. These women, for the most part, aren't desperately single and looking for love through a fictional book about teens, Debbie said. ""I wouldn't go back to dealing with teenage love in a million years. I'm happily married and I have a great relationship, so it's not that I feel that 'Twilight' is filling a void,"" Debbie added. ""The appeal is that it's very simple and pure and it outlines this love story of someone who's average and normal with this stellar, amazing person who has eyes for no one but her and could save her from anything."" Fans camp out for ""New Moon"" Edward & Bella do S&M . It's the fantasy romance of Edward and Bella -- which all of the women acknowledge could never actually happen, a sign of maturity younger fans don't often express -- that inspires them to put some intensity back into their real-life relationships. ""It's helped relationships, because [the fans] are happier nowadays. They have more friends, even if it's just online friends, [and] they're racier now. We hear all the time that people's sex lives haven't been the same since,"" Debbie said. Oddly enough, there's no sex in Meyer's novels, at least nothing that couldn't be replicated in the PG movies they're based on. That hasn't stopped the fans from creating their own sex scenes in copious amounts of fan fiction, some of which have themes like ""Edward and Bella do steamy office affair,"" or ""Edward and Bella try out S&M."" ""It's a rekindling of old feelings, because when you're married and you've got kids and you're running around to the soccer and basketball and football games, [and you've got] work, bills ... the relationship gets pushed off to the side,"" explained Kopicki, herself a mother of two teenagers. ""Your husband may not look exactly like Edward, but just as men have their fantasies, women do too and they need to be able to express it,"" she added. ""A book like 'Twilight' has brought that out."" Twilight Moms, by contrast, aims to keep things family-friendly. Hansen said she wanted the site to be something a woman can browse while in the presence of her kids. Nevertheless, Hansen acknowledges that even the more subdued older ""Twilight"" fans admit feeling attracted. ""Edward is just in a 17-year-old body, but he's actually 108,"" Hansen said with a laugh. ""I have a friend who said she's able to justify her love for Jacob because she counts his age in dog years."" But when the actors are under 18, like Taylor Lautner, the 17-year-old who plays Jacob, is, all of the women agree that a line has to be drawn on the swooning. ""We're very careful about that, because even to me that would feel creepy,"" Hansen said. ""And then we have the mothers who say, 'oh my gosh he's the same age as my son!'"" But, the fans said, no one's actually expecting to date Lautner, Pattinson or Lutz. In the end, the obsession with ""Twilight"" is all in the name of a good time between mothers and daughters, or new friends. ""We're having a really, really fabulous time being 30, 40, or 50. We're very unapologetic of our age,"" Jenny said. ""Women are saying 'so what, I'm 45, I'm married, I have children, but there's no reason why I can't say that Robert Pattinson is hot.'""","Adult female fans of the ""Twilight"" series are just as in love with it as teen girls .
They often take it a step further, spicing up Stephenie Meyer's chaste sex scenes .
They created communities where they can express their ""Twilight"" love without judgment .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- On a clear morning in Kabul, I'm standing on top of a wind-swept mountain, taking in the beauty around me. In the distance, I can see the snow-capped Hindu Kush mountains towering over the sprawling, dusty capital of four million people in front of me. The ruins of the King's and Queen's Palaces -- destroyed during the civil war in 1992 -- are within mortar firing range from where I'm standing. This was where Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the militia leader, and other warlords positioned their tanks against the northern alliance firing relentlessly on the city -- a four-year war that would decimate Kabul, claiming tens of thousands of lives. But Afghanistan has a long history of war and Hekmatyar wasn't the only fighter to have stumbled across this strategic position. Protected by low-lying hills, the crater directly beneath me at the base of the mountain, has been used by the British, the Soviets, the Americans and now the Afghans to fight their enemies. Training side by side . In the past seven years, it has been transformed into Camp Commando where Americans and Afghans work side by side to produce the country's best soldiers. So far, they've trained 10,500 Afghan Commandos who proudly wear the red beret. Among them, 1,000 have gone on to become the country's elite Special Forces. As the U.S. prepares to withdraw troops by the end of the year, the focus has turned to training, advising and assisting the Afghan security forces. Second Lt. Commando Samsoor Ehdiman, 21, is currently midway though his four-month training to join the Special Forces. ""When I see the American Special Forces, I got an idea to be a Special Forces soldier for Afghanistan to help our people in our country so that I can bring peace,"" he said. He is paid a base wage of U.S. $400 per month, but if he qualifies for Special Forces, he will receive an extra U.S. $100-$200 a month in his pay packet. U.S. Commander of the Commando Special Operations Advisory Group (SOAG) Joint Task Force is Colonel Brian Petit. Born and raised in southern California surfing up and down the West Coast, the former Special Forces soldier, who has fought in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan, is now in charge of making this program a success. ""These guys who've done the hard fighting have an incredible track record. If there is a campaign or battle in this country that has been hard fought, the Afghan commandos have had their footprint on it,"" Petit said. Combat to training . While fighting and tactical operations were once carried out by U.S. soldiers, America's role in its longest war has now transitioned into training the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), made of 350,000 army and police. Petit acknowledges it's been a long and difficult journey -- one that is far from over. But they are having successes and Camp Commando is testament to that. The ability of the Afghan Special Forces is outstanding, he said. ""When the formation decides to go and attack an enemy position, take a hill, they will be successful 10 out of 10 times. But we have to remember that the ANSF are 12 years into building their army, and only seven to eight years into building special operations capability. ""So the real treasure is their human capital,"" he said. ""And we have to help them so they can build better systems, better people, better leaders and have the formation so that they can move forward in very tough times and fight and win every time."" Petit's partner in this mission is Major-General Sayed Abdul Karim, Commander of the Afghan National Army Special Operations Command (ANASOC). Seven years ago, 95% of the instructors at Camp Commando's School of Excellence were American, he said. The overwhelming majority now are Afghan. 'America's help essential' While he believes the ANSF can stand on its own feet, it still needs America's help for critical air support, heavy weaponry and intelligence gathering. And while he refuses to get caught up in the political debate about the damage caused by President Hamid Karzai's refusal to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement that would guarantee an enduring U.S. presence after the 2014 pull out, he admits the U.S.-Afghan partnership is essential. ""We still need America's help,"" Karim said. ""If we keep building and improving our forces with their help, one day in the future, we will be part of multinational forces to go somewhere else in the world if there is a conflict. That is what I hope for."" Petit agrees. ""It's a partnership that certainly politics pending that we want here. We have great partners, long standing partners,"" he said. ""This is a strategic partnership that we think will help the Afghan government sustain, hold on, govern properly and protect it's borders. So with a small investment here, I feel confident we could keep transnational terrorists or others that would want to harm us. I think we could keep them pushed back into their caves."" As for a war-weary United States that just wants its troops to come home, Petit can't help but respond as a man who has loved and lost fellow soldiers across this harsh and inhospitable terrain. ""For the people back home, I would just have them remember what they felt on September 11, 2001,"" he said. ""The attacks on the U.S. emanated out of this country, not from this country, but from international terrorists who found this to be a hospitable place. That could happen again.""","For seven years, Americans and Afghans work together to produce country's best soldiers .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- A federal judge has temporarily blocked a controversial Florida law requiring all welfare applicants to be drug-tested. U.S. District Court Judge Mary Scriven issued a temporary injunction Monday evening against enforcement of the law's ""suspicionless drug testing"" of adults seeking federal welfare. The law went into effect July 1, but a single father and the American Civil Liberties Union contend in a lawsuit that the new law is unconstitutional and violates Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure. ""Perhaps no greater public interest exists than protecting a citizen's rights under the Constitution,"" the judge wrote, quoting a 1997 Hawaii case. Under the law, the Florida Department of Children and Family Services requires the drug tests of adults applying to the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. The aid recipients are responsible for the cost of the screening, which they recoup in their assistance if they qualify. Those who fail the required drug testing may designate another individual to receive the benefits on behalf of their children, but they do not receive a refund for cost of the test. Florida Gov. Rick Scott has championed the law, saying it provides ""personal accountability."" He added it was ""unfair for Florida taxpayers to subsidize drug addiction."" Florida is not the first state to pass such legislation. Michigan passed a similar law that was found to be unconstitutional by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2003 for violating the Fourth Amendment. The ACLU filed a class-action suit on behalf of an Orlando single father who opposed the drug test. Luis Lebron, an unemployed adult college student who cares for a 4-year-old son and disabled mother, was denied temporary cash assistance because he refused to be drug tested. The Navy veteran, an undergraduate at the University of Central Florida, contends the law violates his rights and adds he has never used illegal drugs. The judge, sitting in Orlando, agreed to halt the drug testing until the ACLU lawsuit is settled. But the judge denied the plaintiff's request to make the matter a class-action case. ""I'm delighted for our client and delighted to have confirmation that all of us remain protected from unreasonable, suspicionless government searches and seizures,"" said Florida ACLU attorney Maria Kayanan in a written statement. The GOP-controlled legislature passed the bill, and Scott signed it into law in May 2011. ""The governor obviously disagrees with the decision and he will evaluate his options regarding when to appeal,"" said his deputy press secretary Jackie Schutz. Since campaigning for governor, Scott has said that the drug-testing of welfare recipients ""will help to prevent misuse of Florida tax dollars"" and make sure the money goes to the children. ""Research shows higher drug use among individuals receiving government assistance, and drug abuse also forces children into welfare assistance,"" Scott said while signing the bill into law. The ACLU said the state's own study found that of the 2,000 people who took the state drug test, only a small percentage tested positive. ""It shows that a little bit more than 2% of the welfare applicants tested positive for drugs where it's about 8Â½% in the general public,"" said Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida. Lane Wright, the governor's press secretary, said the study is flawed. ""It doesn't take in the deterrent effect,"" Wright said. Wright added there's no way to factor how many people avoided taking the test fearing they would test positive for drugs. After being approved for temporary cash assistance, Luis Lebron was shocked by the mandatory drug test. He then contacted the ACLU. ""This is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, that you can't condition getting some benefit from the government by surrendering your constitutional rights,"" Simon said. Attorneys for the state say pre-employment drug testing is commonplace and that the Navy vet himself could have been subjected to random drug testing while in the military. The governor's office said it is confident the judge ultimately will uphold the constitutionality of the law, contending it's popular among the people of Florida. But Judge Scriven said in her ruling that based on the evidence, ""there is a substantial likelihood"" that Florida's law could be found unconstitutional. Added the ACLU's Simon: ""We're the only state in the country that has this (law).""

"(CNN) -- If volunteer work is a requirement, is it really volunteer? Of course not. But that didn't stop Michigan state Sen. Joe Hune from writing a bill that would require certain welfare recipients to do community service in order to receive public assistance. ""The whole intention is to make certain folks have some skin in the game, and I don't feel that there's any problem with making folks go out and do some kind of community service in order to receive their cash assistance,"" Hune said. Now as a former welfare recipient, I don't have a problem with expecting people to work to earn money. But where I come from we call that a job, not volunteerism. Hunes' bill bastardizes the word while positioning those who challenge it as pro-moocher. It's a political parlor trick designed to fire up the kind of voters who saw nothing wrong with Mitt Romney's infamous statement that 47% of Americans are basically freeloaders. And it reeks of the Reagan Republican worldview that characterizes welfare recipients as parasites or inner-city welfare queens who vote Democratic -- even though seven of the 10 states the U.S. Department of Agriculture reports rely the most on food stamps have Republican governors. The same misdirection applies to the sister bill Hune wrote, which requires drug testing. Reports such as the National Survey of Drug Use and Health suggest drug abuse among welfare recipients is hardly widespread. Many states have tried drug testing for welfare recipients with practically nobody testing positive. In Arizona, for example, in 2012, after three years and 87,000 screenings, one person had failed a drug test. Utah's drug screening program spent $30,000 on testing and only 2.5% of recipients turned out positive for illicit drugs. Florida's program had the same results. In all cases, the testing -- which assumes all welfare recipients are druggies -- cost much more than the savings in welfare payments. And the United States Department of Agriculture found fraud -- selling food stamps illegally -- accounts for a little more than 1% of all food stamp spending nationally. But that doesn't matter. Arguing against testing makes it appear as if you're pro-illicit drug use. Are there people who abuse the system? Yes. And growing up I saw them around me. As Paul Ryan once suggested, the safety net can become ""a hammock that lulls able-bodied people into lives of dependency and complacency."" But it was my experience that people who were working but couldn't make ends meet far outnumbered the abusers. This is what happens when inflation outpaces wage growth for the better part of 40 years. The richest 20% of working families took home nearly half -- 48% -- of the income in 2011. The bottom 20% only took in 5%. These are the sort of details these faux fiscal hawks rarely, if ever, bring up. Which makes today's demonization and humiliation of poor people even more unethical than when Reagan did it. This characterization of poor people as lazy drug abusers is often cast in the narrative of Democrats representing urban areas with large minority populations fighting Republicans from predominantly white regions. It's impossible to ignore a racial component here that neither party should foster. There are ways to put people in a position to earn the aid they receive without trying to rebrand exploitation as volunteerism. For example, establish a program similar to the work-study on college campuses, in which qualified people could have access to jobs designated specifically for them. Transportation for America reported that more than 13% of Michigan bridges are considered structurally deficient, nearly 40% of the roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 161 dams have been classified as ""high hazard."" There is work the state needs done, and not all of it requires a degree in civil engineering. More important, polls indicate Michigan voters at least are willing to support a tax increase to address some of the state's infrastructure needs. If politicians are committed to helping people who are struggling financially but want to discourage sloth, there are creative ways to do that without demonizing the folks who are struggling. But let's not pretend that work in exchange for money is anything other than a employer-employee relationship. To do otherwise is dehumanizing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","Michigan bill would require some welfare recipients to do community service .

"(CNN) -- What will the internet of the future look like? And what purpose will it be used for? From augmented reality, which anticipates the information you'll want just by looking at an object, to smart services that use artificial intelligence to help us manage our workloads, the look, feel and utility of the internet of 2040 is a wide open field. Already advances in virtual reality technology - Facebook notably bought the virtual reality start-up Oculus VR for $2bn this year - are beginning to change the way we deal with everything from medical science, to military training, to learning difficulties. To what extent, however, we'll have control over our own data is one of the future's great unanswered questions. For many the future of the internet is already here; and it looks a lot like it did in 1990s. Called the Darknet, this anonymised section of the net allows everyone from copyright pirates, to drug dealers, to dissidents to communicate and do business without fear of leaving their digital fingerprints. Special browser . Jamie Bartlett, whose book ""The Dark Net"" investigates the digital underworld, told CNN that this opaque and subversive world is inaccessible through normal browsers, and requires special software. ""A special browser called Tor allows a user to browse the internet without their IP address being given away,"" Bartlett said. ""It uses a clever encryption system that means no one can see what computer a user is on."" This same encryption system also affords anonymity to the websites that inhabit this corner of the web, meaning that governments and law enforcers have no idea where the site is being hosted. That doesn't mean that the individuals running these operations can forever remain hidden, as the capture of the creator of ""Silk Road"", a famous illegal online marketplace, by the FBI in 2013 demonstrates. Still, the tools to make life difficult for law enforcement seem to be there: ""Anyone can set up these websites which are almost impossible to shut down and censor,"" he said. ""As a result it's a bit of a Wild West -- more or less anything goes. ""You've got illegal pornography there, these drugs markets there, assassination markets and hit men for hire. All sorts of terrible stuff but also all sorts of good stuff too. ""Democratic revolutionaries, whistle blowers, human rights activists who are also concerned about giving away their location also want somewhere where they can post stuff illegally and anonymously."" U.S. military . Bartlett said the browser was initially developed by the U.S. military as a way of traversing the internet secretly, but since then had become an open source project. He suggests the military released the encrypted browser as a way of providing cover for their operations. Because the Tor browser uses a non-standard protocol, people observing network traffic can identify it easily even if they can't see what the user is looking at. ""They realised that this is not a good idea if the only people using it are the US military -- it's going to be obvious who they are. For that reason, they turned it into an open source project."" Today, the Darknet is moving from fringe to mainstream, attracting anyone who wants anonymity -- be they hired killers or humble bloggers. Back to the future . For Bartlett, the Darknet is a return to the labrynthine recesses of the first days of the worldwide web. He said the future of the net is likely to be an increased proliferation of these non-standard protocols that provide ever deeper levels of anonymity. ""It really feels like the early days of the internet ... (everything) is hosted on these rudimentary networks. It's like the internet of the early 90s when things weren't indexed the way they are now. ""Everything is hyperlinked together and Google can find everything, but back in the day the whole internet was dark -- you didn't know what you were doing or where you were going. ""You even used to write down web addresses on pieces of paper and pass them to each other."" Art project . Just what can be found on the Darknet is often the subject of wild conjecture, but a recent project launched by the !Mediengruppe Bitnik art collective -- called ""The Darknet -- From Memes to Onionland"" - shows exactly what is on offer on the Internet's underbelly. Arming an automated internet bot with US$100 in bitcoins (the crypto-currency accepted as legal tender on many illicit marketplaces) the ""Random Darknet Shopper"" trawls its murky corners and every week buys one item at random. So far, the bot has purchased a ""stash can"" of Sprite that doubles as a hiding place for either drugs or money, a platinum Visa card for $35, 10 Ecstasy Pills from Germany for US$48, 10 packets of Chesterfield cigarettes from Moldova, and many other items such as jeans, ""designer"" bags, and books. One of the most intriguing pieces for the exhibitors at the Kunst Halle St. Gallen gallery in St. Gallen, Switzerland -- where all the parcels arrive -- has been a fireman's set of skeleton keys from the United Kingdom. ""Our first question was what do you do with this? What does it open?"" Carmen Weisskopf, co-founder of the art collective, told CNN. On the Darknet, the keys are advertised as useful for unlocking toolboxes or ""gaining access to communal gates and storage areas."" 'Thrilling and scary' She said receiving the parcels at the gallery was at once ""thrilling and scary."" ""The motivation for the artwork really came in the light of the Snowden revelations - for internet artists it meant we had to re-evaluate the networks we work in. We became really interested in looking at these anonymous and encrypted networks from an artistic point of view."" She said the starting point for them had been how to build trust in an anonymous network. The project has already dented the levels of trust at the art collective who early on in the project called in the services of a lawyer to shore up their legal position should the bot turn up anything that puts them outside the law. Fortunately, Weisskopf said, firearm sales are limited to clients within the United States. ""That's why we got the idea of going into marketplaces because trust is something you need to build in markets."" The artists have already gained notoriety by sending a parcel to fugitive whistleblower Julian Assange. The parcel was equipped with a cam that recorded its journey through the postal service to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Assange is currently holed up. Read more from Tomorrow Transformed: .

"New York (CNN) -- Beyond the unhealthy influence that our demand for factory-farmed meat has in the area of food-borne illness and communicable diseases, we could cite many other influences on public health, most obviously the now-widely recognized relationship between the nation's major killers -- heart disease, No. 1; cancer, No. 2; and stroke, No. 3 -- and meat consumption. Or, much less obviously, the distorting influence of the meat industry on the information about nutrition we receive from the government and medical professionals. In 1917, while World War I devastated Europe and just before the Spanish flu devastated the world, a group of women, in part motivated to make maximal use of America's food resources during wartime, founded what is now the nation's premier group of food and nutrition professionals, the American Dietetic Association. Since the 1990s, the group has issued what has become the standard we-definitely-know-this-much summary of the healthfulness of a vegetarian diet. The association takes a conservative stand, leaving out many well-documented health benefits attributable to reducing the consumption of animal products. Here are the three key sentences from the summary of the relevant scientific literature. One: Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood and adolescence, and for athletes. Two: Vegetarian diets tend to be lower in saturated fat and cholesterol, and have higher levels of dietary fiber, magnesium and potassium, vitamins C and E, folate, carotenoids, flavonoids and other phytochemicals. Three: Vegetarians and vegans, including those who are athletes, ""meet and exceed requirements"" for protein, the paper notes elsewhere. And, to render the whole we-should-worry-about-getting-enough-protein-and-therefore-eat-meat idea even more useless, other data suggest that excess animal protein intake is linked with osteoporosis, kidney disease, calcium stones in the urinary tract and some cancers. Despite some persistent confusion, it is clear that vegetarians and vegans tend to have more optimal protein consumption than omnivores. Finally, we have the really important news, based not on speculation, however well-grounded in basic science such speculation might be, but on the definitive gold standard of nutritional research: studies on actual human populations. ""Vegetarian diets are often associated with a number of health advantages, including lower blood cholesterol levels, lower risk of heart disease"" (which alone accounts for more than 25 percent of all annual deaths in the nation), ""lower blood pressure levels, and lower risk of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index"" (that is, they are not as fat) ""and lower overall cancer rates"" (cancers account for nearly another 25 percent of all annual deaths in the nation). If it's sometimes hard to believe that eschewing animal products will make it easier to eat healthfully, there is a reason: We are constantly lied to about nutrition. Let me be precise. When I say we are being lied to, I'm not impugning the scientific literature but relying upon it. What the public learns of the scientific data on nutrition and health, especially from the government's nutritional guidelines, comes to us by way of many hands. From the start, those who produce meat have made sure that they are among those who influence how nutritional data will be presented to the likes of you and me. Consider, for example, the National Dairy Council, a marketing arm of Dairy Management Inc., an industry body whose sole purpose, according to its Web site, is to ""drive increased sales of and demand for U.S. dairy products."" The council promotes dairy consumption without regard for negative public-health consequences and even markets dairy to communities incapable of digesting the stuff. As it is a trade group, the dairy council's behavior is at least understandable. What is hard to comprehend is why educators and government have, since the 1950s, allowed the dairy council to become arguably the largest and most important supplier of nutritional-education materials in the nation. Worse, our present federal ""nutritional"" guidelines come to us from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the very same government department that has worked so hard to make factory farming the norm in America. The USDA has a monopoly on the most important advertising space in the nation, those little nutritional boxes we find on virtually everything we eat. Founded the same year that the American Dietetic Association opened its offices, the USDA was charged with providing nutritional information to the nation and ultimately with creating guidelines that would serve public health. At the same time, though, the USDA was charged with promoting industry. The conflict of interest is not subtle: Our nation gets its federally endorsed nutritional information from an agency that must support the food industry, which today means supporting factory farms. The details of misinformation that dribble into our lives (like fears about ""enough protein"") follow naturally from this fact and have been reflected upon in detail by writers like Marion Nestle. As a public-health expert, Nestle has worked extensively with government -- on ""The Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health,"" for one -- and has had decades of interaction with the food industry. In many ways, her conclusions confirm what we already expected, but the insider's perspective she brings has lent a new clarity to the picture of just how much influence the food industry, especially animal agriculture, has on national nutrition policy. She argues that food companies, like cigarette companies, will say and do whatever works to sell products. They will ""lobby Congress to eliminate regulations perceived as unfavorable; they press federal regulatory agencies not to enforce such regulations; and when they don't like regulatory decisions, they file lawsuits. Like cigarette companies, food companies co-opt food and nutrition experts by supporting professional organizations and research, and they expand sales by marketing directly to children."" Regarding U.S. government recommendations that tend to encourage dairy consumption in the name of preventing osteoporosis, Nestle notes that in parts of the world where milk is not a staple of the diet, people often have less osteoporosis and fewer bone fractures than Americans do. The highest rates of osteoporosis are seen in countries where people consume the most dairy foods. In a striking example of food industry influence, Nestle argues that the USDA has an informal policy to avoid saying that we should ""eat less"" of any food, no matter how damaging its health impact may be. Thus, instead of saying ""eat less meat,"" which might be helpful, it advises us to ""keep fat intake to less than 30 percent of total calories,"" which is obscure to say the least. The institution we have put in charge of telling us when foods are dangerous has a policy of not (directly) telling us when foods, especially if they are animal products, are dangerous. We have let the food industry craft our national nutrition policy, which influences everything from what foods are stocked in the health-food aisle at the local grocery store to what our children eat at school. In the National School Lunch Program, for example, more than half a billion of our tax dollars are given to the dairy, beef, egg and poultry industries to provide animal products to children, despite the fact that nutritional data would suggest we should reduce these foods in our diets. Meanwhile, a modest $161 million is offered to buy fruits and vegetables that even the USDA admits we should eat more of. Wouldn't it make more sense and be more ethical for the National Institutes of Health, an organization specializing in human health and having nothing to gain beyond it, to have this responsibility? The global implications of the growth of the factory farm, especially given the problems of food-borne illness, antimicrobial resistance and potential pandemics, are genuinely terrifying. India's and China's poultry industries have grown somewhere between 5 and 13 percent annually since the 1980s. If India and China started to eat poultry in the same quantities as Americans -- 27 to 28 birds annually -- they alone would consume as many chickens as the entire world does today. If the world followed America's lead, it would consume more than 165 billion chickens annually, even without an increase in population. And then what? Two hundred billion? Five hundred? Will the cages stack higher or grow smaller or both? On what date will we accept the loss of antibiotics as a tool to prevent human suffering? How many days of the week will our grandchildren be ill? Where does it end? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan Safran Foer.","Safran Foer:  Food industry influences what stores stock, what schoolchildren eat .

"(CNN) -- The federal government will give $1 billion in grants to law enforcement agencies in every state to pay for the hiring and rehiring of law enforcement officers, Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder announced Tuesday. Police officers in Chicago, Illinois, patrol the streets in November 2008. The money comes from the stimulus bill -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 -- the officials said. The law is designed to help pull the U.S. out of its recession by providing and saving jobs, and helping those most affected by the downturn in the economy. Beneficiaries can include state, local and tribal governments. The Department of Justice received more than 7,200 applications for more than 39,000 officer positions, representing a total of $8.3 billion in requested funding. ""The tremendous demand for these grants is indicative of both the tough times our states, cities and tribes are facing, and the unyielding commitment by law enforcement to making our communities safer,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder in a statement. Biden spoke of the bravery of police officers who never know when they might be shot, even on a simple call. With rows of police officers standing behind him, he pointed out the hazards and uncertainty of police work. ""It's just astounding to me how much we take for granted what you do, and thankfully how much you take for granted what you do,"" said Biden. ""We ask you to go out to defend us, and you're entitled to be equipped to defend us,"" he added. The Recovery Act includes $4 billion in Department of Justice grant funding to local law enforcement. Some of this money was distributed to states previously to help crime victims, women who are targets of violence, Internet crimes against children and other needs. The current round of grants will be awarded to 1,046 law enforcement agencies in all 50 states, and will provide 100 percent of the approved salary and benefits for 4,699 officers for three years. Police departments that receive the money must retain the grant-funded positions for a fourth year. The grants will be administered by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). Funding decisions were based on reported crimes for the previous calendar year, community policing activities, budget changes, and poverty, unemployment, and foreclosure rates in the area. ""These officers will go to the places where they are needed  the most,"" Holder said. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, who attended the news conference, said five police officers were killed in the line of duty in his city between May 3, 2008, and February 13, 2009. ""So violence is very much a concern here in Philadelphia,"" he said. ""There is far too much violence taking place every day on the streets of our city."" Pennsylvania plans to create or save 93 law enforcement positions statewide by awarding more than $20 million to 19 law enforcement agencies. The Philadelphia Police Department will be able to create and or preserve 50 jobs, according to the statement explaining the grants. Pennsylvania is one of the hardest-hit states in terms of economic decline, officials said. More than 19 percent of the families in Philadelphia live in poverty, and the unemployment rate jumped from 6.4 percent in 2008 to 8.8 percent in 2009.","Stimulus bill funds will pay for officers in every state .

"(CNN) -- It could be the worst mass poisoning in history. And the terrible irony is that it may all be due to an idealistic push to clean up drinking water for some of the world's poorest people. A new study published in British medical journal The Lancet says that up to 77 million people in Bangladesh are being exposed to toxic levels of arsenic, potentially taking years or decades off their lives. An international team of researchers from Chicago, New York and Bangladesh followed 12,000 people over the past decade, monitoring their arsenic intake and mortality rates from contaminated wells. By the end of the study, one in five deaths were determined to be directly related to elevated arsenic levels in their system. Stretch that over the entire population that takes its water from wells, and the impact is daunting. The problem has been known about for years, if not the overall deadly impact. As far back as a decade ago, the World Health Organization called it ""the largest mass poisoning of a population in history... beyond the accidents at Bhopal, India, in 1984, and Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986."" Well-meaning development groups had encouraged remote villages across Bangladesh to dig wells over the past decades, rather than rely on potentially contaminated surface water and dirty rivers. But now potentially a much worse problem has been found far below the surface. Arsenic is a deadly poison with a history of use in intrigue and assassination. Some have even theorized that Napoleon Bonaparte succumbed to long term poisoning with the substance by his enemies while in exile on the island of St. Helena. But the element and its derivatives are also used in many industries, such as metal smelting and as a component in products ranging from insecticide to micro-chips. And unfortunately, it is also found in abundance in the soil and rock in Bangladesh. It's leached up through the water table in tens of millions of water wells across the country. The study showed that the top quarter of those exposed had a 70 percent higher mortality rate than would be expected in the population as a whole. The authors hope for more study, and a long term plan to deal with the damage already done. But a solution for those already poisoned may remain decades away. Other long term health studies have shown it takes 20 years for the negative morbidity effects of arsenic poisoning to dissipate, even after they stopped using contaminated wells.","Contamination taking years off lives of up to 77 million in Bangladesh .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- A former University of Central Florida student found dead in his dorm room of an apparent suicide, alongside weapons and a backpack of bombs, planned a larger attack, officials said Monday. School spokesman Grant Heston identified the student as 30-year-old James Oliver Seevakumaran. He was at the university from fall 2010 through fall 2012 but was not enrolled for the spring semester and was in the process of being removed from the dorm room where he lived. ""While the crime scene processing was under way in that room, we found some notes and some writings that indicated that this was a planned attack,"" UCF Police Chief Richard Beary told reporters. He said Seevakumaran's plan appeared to be set in motion as early as February, when weapons and ammunition purchases were made. Seevakumaran developed an outline for the attack, but that never came to fruition, thanks in part to the rapid response of law enforcement, Beary said. The chief told CNN's Erin Burnett that he believes Seevakumaran built the bombs himself, but authorities were still trying to figure out how Seevakumaran was going to carry out his plan and whom he was going to target. ""It wasn't exactly clear what the attack was going to consist of. However, he did have a time line of how he was getting ready and preparing and then in the end, he would just 'give them hell' is the quote that he used,"" Beary told CNN. When police entered the dorm room, they found Seevakumaran dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, a handgun, an assault weapon, a couple hundred rounds of ammunition and four homemade bombs in a backpack. An Orange County Sheriff's bomb squad team examined the explosives and rendered them harmless. Federal agents have joined the investigation, and the bombs were sent to an FBI lab to determine what materials were used. It all started around 12:20 a.m., when a fire alarm went off at the Tower 1 dormitory. Beary told CNN that Seevakumaran pulled the fire alarm, perhaps to draw many people out into the open. Police believe that Seevakumaran then went to his room to pick up the weapons. There, he encountered one of his roommates, who told police that Seevakumaran pointed a weapon at him. The roommate ran into a bathroom and called 911. Officers arrived within minutes to rescue the roommate. They found Seevakumaran's body in his bedroom. Beary said police are still investigating to find out ""what made him tick,"" but early indications were that Seevakumaran had very few friends and had anger issues. According to Heston, the school spokesman, Seevakumaran had never been seen by UCF counselors and had not had any student conduct issues. He had one prior contact with law enforcement -- a traffic arrest in 2006 -- the police chief said. The dorm, home to about 500 students, was evacuated. ""The way they handled it was disappointing because it started as a fire alarm,"" said dorm resident Antionette Thompson. ""Nobody said what was going on with a bomb and the shooting. So we were left in the dark."" Thompson was among five dorm evacuees sitting together on a campus bench, some of them bundled up in a blanket, others still dressed in their pajamas. Another student dorm resident, Ashley Graham, said they received a text from authorities warning about a ""suspicious death in Tower 1."" ""It's really horrible that someone had to die,"" said Nathalie Sils-Aine. ""It just makes me feel more unsafe."" The university said it was providing food and counseling for the evacuated students at its Veterans Academic Resource Center. Tower 1 reopened later Monday. Firearms are prohibited at UCF, which is home to about 59,000 students at its main Orlando campus and 10 regional facilities. As the evacuated students waited for hours to return to their building, worst-case scenarios raced through their heads. ""He was just above us,"" Graham said. ""What if the roof caved in because a bomb went off and everyone in the building got hurt? That's just the crazy part."" John Couwels reported from Orlando. Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Marlena Baldacci also contributed to this report.","NEW: James Oliver Seevakumaran, 30, had built four homemade bombs, police chief says .

Or maybe they were drunk while shopping? Regardless of the reason, there are too many good people getting bad gifts. This isn't about being ungrateful. It's about being honest. We have all received gifts that require us to fake a smile as our eyes dart around desperately hoping to locate the receipt. I'm not alone in feeling this way. Earlier this week, I posted a simple question on Twitter and Facebook: Have you ever received a bad holiday gift? The responses were off the charts. Christmas, Hanukah, Eid, etc. -- it didn't matter, you pick the holiday and I can list you a bunch of bad gifts. So, I humbly offer to be your gift-giving guide --sort of like the ghost in Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol."" And in keeping with that classic holiday tale, we will start by looking at holidays past in the hopes that you won't replicate the gift-giving catastrophes of bygone days. 1. Don't give gifts that imply the recipient is fat or needs to improve his or her looks . This came up numerous times. People thought they were being helpful by surprising their friend or loved one with a gift certificate for a weight loss program like Jenny Craig or for a personal trainer. The most astounding gift was a voucher for a Botox treatment given to Hanadi Kalla -- she was 26 years old at the time. Only give these types of gifts if discussed in advance or prepare yourself for the consequences. 2. Overly practical gifts . These were typically given by husbands or boyfriends to their wives or girlfriends. Here are a few of the gems: an ice scraper for the car, a battery organizer, Pyrex dishes, and my favorite was this gift to Beth Richardson: A replacement car antenna -- yes, installation was included. These gifts are fine if a person asks for it. But barring a specific request: No electric can openers as holiday gifts. 3. Re-gifting nightmares . Look, we have all re-gifted things. But there's a right way and a dreadfully wrong way to do this. Here are examples of what not to do. A person received a sweater that was not only clearly used, but it smelled like cigarette smoke. (Yes, the gift-giver was a smoker.) And then there's Sarah Elbatanouny, whose boyfriend gave her a used Palm Pilot that had been owned by his ex-girlfriend. But it gets worse: He actually wrapped it with an old Playboy magazine because he couldn't find wrapping paper. Re-gifting should be in the original packaging and the gift should look new. 4. Gifts that have no connection to the person . I have a Muslim friend who was given a holiday gift of a 12-pound baked ham. I'm not kidding! Another person received thick wool ski socks even though she had never skied and lived in Southern California. And then there was the box of chocolates given to @maverick_kris -- only problem was that he's diabetic. Today, most people are on Facebook, so you can easily see their interests and shop accordingly. So if the person has posted on Facebook ""I hate the outdoors,"" don't buy them camping equipment. Now let me morph into the ghost of holiday gift future and offer you some tips that may be helpful in your gift selection process: . 1. Ask the person what they would like . Wow, pretty simple right? Yet for some reason in this world of instant communication where we are all connected via e-mail, text, and/or social media, some would prefer to just guess at what the person may like. 2. Yes, gift cards are fine . If you still have no idea what to buy, then pick up a gift card to a major chain store. There may have been a time when these seemed like the least thoughtful gift, but I think most would prefer these over cinnamon flavored candles or a re-gifted fern. Hopefully, my efforts as the ghost of holiday gifts past and future will help you navigate this holiday season. After all, if you are going to expend the effort to get someone a holiday gift, then why not give a gift they will truly enjoy and appreciate?

"(CNN) -- A thick pall of chemical smoke hung over a crowd in Cairo on Friday afternoon. People ran, covering their noses and mouths to escape yet another volley of tear gas. The same scene was being played out elsewhere in Cairo, in Alexandria and Suez. And several weeks back, Tunisian police used tear gas to try to quell protests there. It is one of the most common ways to used to disperse protests -- but not everyone runs. In both Tunisia and Egypt, some protesters stopped to pick up canisters, and posted photographs online. A few inches long, blue and silver, they include warning labels and then a set of initials: CSI, followed by ""Made in the U.S.A."" The photograph posted in Tunisia was of a 40 mm riot CS smoke projectile, made by a company called Combined Systems Inc., which describes itself as a ""tactical weapons company"" and is based in Jamestown, Pennsylvania. CSI's website describes the projectile as ""a launched burning extended-range single projectile round that dispenses smoke or chemical agents via rapid burning. Used effectively during riots at safe stand-off distances to disperse groups or deny areas."" Its warning label reads: ""Danger: Do not fire directly at person(s). Severe injury or death may result."" That warning is apparently not always followed. Lucas Mebrouk Dolega died in Tunisia on January 17, three days after being hit by a tear gas grenade at close range. The 32-year-old was a photographer for the European PressPhoto Agency. On Thursday, a similar picture was posted on Twitter by a someone in Egypt, only this time it was of a grenade, not a canister. It, too, was made by CSI. The grenade appears to be an ""Outdoor 52 Series Large Grenade"" that ""discharges a high volume of smoke and chemical agent through multiple emission ports. Specifically for outdoor use,"" the website says. CSI's website (www.less-lethal.com) bills the company as the ""premier engineering, manufacturing and supply company of tactical munitions and crowd control devices globally to armed forces, law enforcement, corrections and homeland security agencies."" Clients include the U.S. Army, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, and the U.S. Department of State, as well as Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israeli Military Industries -- both of which are weapons companies based in Israel. On January 1, Jawaher Abu Rahmah died in the West Bank during a weekly protest against a security barrier being built in Bilin. Israel considers the protests violent and illegal. Rahmah died of severe asphyxiation and cardiac arrest after Israeli soldiers fired tear gas canisters into the crowd. In April 2009, Rahmah's brother was killed participating in the same weekly protest when a tear gas canister struck him directly in the chest. A spokesman for CSI says the company is operating well within the law by selling tear gas to countries like Tunisia and Egypt. According to the Chemical Weapons Convention, riot control agents are not considered chemical weapons unless used during a time of war. This means that it's perfectly legal to manufacture and sell tear gas, so long as countries don't stockpile a large amount of the chemical compounds. The spokesman declined to say how much tear gas CSI had sold to countries in northern Africa, but said it is a small company. He also said CSI could not control how its products are used once sold. Social media reaction to the ""Made in the U.S.A."" label on the canisters was scathing, with some suggesting it meant the U.S. government itself was somehow involved in suppressing the protests. Some Twitter users demanded to know ""why so many weapons used against Egyptian protesters read 'made in the USA'."" Others advised ""Maybe U.S. weapons manufacturers should stop printing ""made in USA"" on their weapons especially the ones we send to brutal autocrats."" Whether CSI is operating within the law hasn't stopped protestors from voicing their dissatisfaction with the company. After Rahmah died in Israel, demonstrators gathered outside Point Lookout Capital Partners' Manhattan offices. Point Lookout owns a majority interest in CSI. The protesting group -- the New York Campaign for the Boycott of Israel -- demanded that CSI stop providing tear gas that could be used on Palestinians by Israeli forces. Israeli authorities are still investigating Jawaher Abu Rahmah's death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are several compounds that are considered to be riot-control agents. Two of the most common are chloroacetophenone (CN) and chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS). Others include chloropicrin (PS), bromobenzylcyanide (CA), and dibenzoxazepine (CR). Riot control agents temporarily disable those affected by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin. Long-lasting exposure to these compounds can cause blindness and chemical burning of the throat and lungs resulting in death, as well as respiratory failure, which can also result in death.","Tear gas canisters fired at Egyptian protesters are marked ""Made in the U.S.A.""

"(EW.com) -- Mariah Carey is clarifying her feelings about working on Fox's ""American Idol."" ""Honestly, I hated it,"" she said during a Hot 97 radio interview when asked about her time judging season 12 of the talent competition earlier this year along with Randy Jackson, Keith Urban and — most infamously and contentiously — Nicki Minaj. So how much did she hate it? ""I was led to believe — I was the first person signed on,"" Carey said (video below). ""Heaven forbid I look like I'm saying something negative, but honestly I thought it was going to be a three-person panel. They gave me a nice dangling monetary moment. I was like, okay, Randy Jackson will be there, I've known him forever. This isn't a big deal. This will be nothing. But it wasn't that. It was like hell. It was like going to work every day in hell with Satan."" So, yes. She apparently really despised being on Idol. As Carey laughed and covered her eyes at her last comment, the host asked, ""Really?"" And then Carey added: ""Nah, I'm just playing. It didn't affect me that much."" Oh, okay, she was pretty cool with it? ""I was disappointed,"" she added-added. So she was disappointed then? ""I loved the contestants. And some of them were so good, and also really good people."" So dealing with the contestants — that part Carey liked? ""It was disappointing when they would — for political reasons — not put [contestants] through. And I'm like, I'm not going to sit here and do this. I would prefer to put this person in a studio and record a record with them."" ""Idol"" really hired Carey as a judge? She can't even clearly state her own opinion — about her own opinion! The singer just released a new single titled, ironically, ""The Art of Letting Go.""

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- A man who stayed in a Las Vegas hotel room where ricin was found is in critical condition at a hospital, where he has been since mid-February, said a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department official. A man is in critical condition after exposure to ricin at a Las Vegas, Nevada, hotel. Deputy Chief Kathy Suey said the man called from the hotel asking for medical help on February 14, saying he was suffering from respiratory distress, and was transported to the hospital. Since he was gone from the extended-stay hotel and not paying his rent, managers began eviction procedures, Suey said at a news conference. A friend or relative of his who came to remove his belongings from the room found the ricin Thursday, she said.  Watch Suey describe how the ricin was found » . Tests confirm the substance found in the room was ricin, police said, but it remains a mystery how it got there. Suey said the man hospitalized was not a suspect and police don't know whether the ricin was his, or if he even knew it was there. The FBI said it was treating the matter as a criminal investigation and terrorism was not suspected. Pets were found in the room, Suey said. ""Two of those pets are fine. One of the pets is deceased or was put down,"" she said. There was no evidence that the animal died from ricin exposure, Suey said.  ""The dog that was in there was without food and water for a week."" She said the man was unable to speak to police, but a doctor at the briefing said he held out hope the man might recover enough to provide information. ""Usually, if [ricin victims] survive the first three to five days, they usually do fine,"" said Dr. Lawrence Sands of the Southern Nevada Health District, emphasizing that he didn't know specifics of the case. As little as 500 micrograms of the toxin -- an amount the size of the head of a pin -- can kill an adult.  Watch how ricin poisoning affects people » . Suey said seven people -- including apartment management and police officers -- had been taken to the hospital to be checked out after the ricin was discovered.  None showed signs of poisoning, and all had been released, she said. Symptoms of ricin poisoning can include anything from difficulty breathing, fever, cough, nausea and sweating to severe vomiting and dehydration. ""We did have enough ricin to be of concern,"" said Capt. Joe Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Lombardo said areas of the hotel exposed to the toxin have been decontaminated. The discovery of ricin alarms law-enforcement agencies because authorities in several countries have investigated links between suspect extremists and ricin. Ricin is a poison that can be made from waste left over after processing castor beans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The toxin can come in the form of a mist or pellet and can be dissolved in water or weak acid, according to the CDC. The agency also said the toxin works by getting inside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need. Lombardo said authorities found castor beans in the room and also powder in a small vial. He said ricin is not illegal to own, but it's illegal if processed to be used for poisoning someone. Ricin has limited medical uses -- it can be used to kill cancer cells and bone marrow transplants. CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, said that while a small amount can kill somebody if injected, tons of it would be needed to use as a mass terrorism tool. Gupta said there are three ways of exposure to ricin: inhalation, ingestion or injections. If inhaled, people may develop fever, a cough, nausea, fluid in the lungs and organ failure. There is no specific test for exposure and no antidote once exposed, he said. There have been other reported cases involving ricin in the United States. In January 2005, the FBI arrested an Ocala, Florida, man with no known ties to terrorists or extremists after agents found ricin in the home he lives in with his mother. Ricin was found in February 2004 in the mailroom of the Dirksen Senate Office Building in Washington. The mailroom handles correspondence addressed to U.S. lawmakers. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.","NEW: Hospitalized man not a suspect, police say; it's unknown if ricin was his .

"(CNN) -- Mad cow disease has caused a fourth death in the United States, health officials say. Lab tests have confirmed that a patient in Texas who recently died had Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. Variant CJD is a fatal brain disorder linked to eating beef from cattle with mad cow disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a press release. Variant CJD was first identified in the United Kingdom in 1996, according to the CDC. Worldwide more than 220 cases have been reported, the majority in Europe. CDC officials said this is only the fourth case to be reported in the United States, and that each U.S. infection is believed to have happened while the patient was traveling abroad. The Texan patient traveled ""extensively"" to Europe and the Middle East, the CDC said. ""There are no Texas public health concerns or threats associated with this case,"" the Texas Department of State Health Services posted to its website. Variant CJD is different than what the CDC calls classic CJD, which is not related to mad cow disease. Classic CJD strikes less than 400 Americans each year. It is also fatal. Case of CJD confirmed in New Hampshire . Mad cow disease is officially called bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE. Animals with BSE have infectious prions in their brain, spinal cord and some parts of the central nervous system. These prions can be spread to humans who eat those specific parts of the cow, or who eat meat that has come in contact with infected tissue or that has been processed in contaminated machinery. Eating meat contaminated with the disease is thought to be the cause of Variant CJD in humans. The first case of mad cow disease was confirmed in a cow in the United States in December 2003.

"BILOXI, Mississippi (CNN) -- While most voters this year have said the economy or Iraq is their top priority, some Mississippi voters have a different focus -- recovering from Hurricane Katrina. Hurricane Katrina ravaged Biloxi, Mississippi, when the storm tore through in 2005. Mississippi, which holds its primaries on Tuesday, was hit hard by the storm in 2005. Two-and-half years later, the evidence of the damage is all too clear. ""Some folks care, some people just don't,"" said John Nutter, who lives in Biloxi. His brother Derrel cries as he speaks of the house his father built. The mortgage company just foreclosed on the family home -- the home he grew up in.  Watch the brothers talk about their struggle » . Mark Jones, president of Urban Life Missions, moved to the battered Gulf Coast region to help people in need. Jones says his organization doesn't have the money to help the Nutter family. ""Everything the candidates are talking about is important to the candidates, but I don't believe it's hitting the pulse of what's happened to the Gulf and the people here,"" he said. Katrina was ""the single most catastrophic natural disaster in U.S. history,"" according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It devastated more than 90,000 square miles, led to the displacement of 270,000 Americans and inflicted more than $81 billion in damage. But the irony is as families are still struggling to get back on their feet, casino business in Biloxi is booming. Biloxi Mayor A.J. Holloway says the casinos raked in more than a billion dollars in gross revenue this year. That money has gone toward new schools, but individual homeowners need something else. ""We still need to have some type of stimulus, that the government could come in, that they could put in some businesses. ... Something like that, that can bring more people in here, more money and better jobs,"" he said. A recent poll shows Sen. Barack Obama leading Sen. Hillary Clinton 58-34 percent in Mississippi. The American Research Group poll questioned 600 likely Democratic primary voters and has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The poll was conducted March 5-6. Clinton and Obama have been talking about their plan for Gulf Coast recovery as they've campaigned in Mississippi, which has 33 delegates at stake. ""When Katrina and Rita struck the Gulf Coast, the president did not respond,"" Clinton told supporters in Canton, Mississippi. ""I have said that I will do whatever I can to make up for lost time as your president."" Clinton said she would have someone in the White House who is responsible for updating her on the rebuilding process every day. Obama on Monday vowed that the ""failed policies of the last 7 years"" -- including Hurricane Katrina -- will be over next year. ""If we're spending $12 billion a month in Iraq, we can spend some of that money right here in the United States of America, rebuilding roads and bridges and hospitals and schools and putting people back to work all across Mississippi, rebuilding the Gulf Coast, rebuilding after the storm -- that work is not yet done,"" he said in Columbus. Looking ahead to Tuesday's primary, voters along the state's Gulf Coast say the next two years must be better regardless of who wins the White House, because things can't get any worse. ""I'm going to be honest with you, I think in a few days we're going to be out on the streets. We've got nowhere else to go,"" John Nutter said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband wants his 94-year-old wife to become a mother again using an egg donor, artificial insemination and a surrogate mother, Prince Frederic von Anhalt told CNN Thursday. ""I've gone through the initial steps of donor matching and blood work and next week the donation process will begin,"" von Anhalt said. Gabor's only child, Francesca Hilton, described herself as shocked when told of the plan Thursday. ""That's just weird,"" Hilton said. Von Anhalt, 67, said he is working with Dr. Mark Surry of the Southern California Reproductive Center in Beverly Hills. CNN calls to the center have not been returned. CNN Health: Relax! It won't happen . Gabor has suffered major health problems in the last year, including hip replacement surgery and a leg amputation. She has been unable to walk since a 2002 car accident. ""I'm a retired guy,"" von Anhalt said. ""I can take care of it."" Gabor talked about adding a new baby to the family when they got married 25 years ago, and she brought the topic up again in recent months, he said. One reason is their desire to have someone carry on the famous Gabor name. None of her two sisters left an heir and her only child does not use the Gabor name, von Anhalt said. Francesca Hilton, 64, is Gabor's only child, the product of her second marriage to hotel magnate Conrad Hilton. She told CNN that her full name is Constance Francesca Gabor Hilton. The process, which includes finding an egg donor and a surrogate mother to give birth to the baby, will cost about $100,000, von Anhalt estimated. The prince, who acquired his royal title when he was adopted as an adult by a German woman, is Gabor's ninth husband. He has complained in recent months about financial burdens caused by his wife's hospitalizations. While he put their Bel Air, California mansion up for sale earlier this year, he said he is not actively marketing it. ""In life you need something to live for,"" he said. ""If my wife passes away before me, I have nothing to live for."" The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is famous for her many marriages and strong personality as well as her acting prowess. Her more prominent films include John Huston's Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge,"" in 1952, ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953, ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957, and Orson Welles' 1958 cult classic, ""Touch of Evil.""","Gabor's husband says he's looking for an egg donor and surrogate to carry Gabor's baby .

"Washington (CNN) -- Outgoing Rep. Michele Bachmann, true to form, attributed the United States' economic rise through history to ""the Ten Commandments"" in her final speech on the House floor Tuesday night. The Minnesota Republican cited to the U.S. motto, officially adopted in 1956, of ""In God we trust,"" and saying it's ""fabulous"" that the United States decided to ""declare, in full voice, that it is in God that we as a nation put our trust."" She pointed to a statue of Moses that sits above the House chamber's doors, calling the prophet important to Judaism, Christianity and Islam ""the greatest law-giver."" ""Here in the United States, the Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses is the very foundation of the law that has given happiness and the rise of the greatest prosperity that any nation has known before,"" Bachmann said. ""It could be no coincidence that this nation, knowing and enjoying the heights of such great happiness and such great prosperity, that it could be built upon that foundation of the Ten Commandments and by the law given by the God in whom we trust,"" she said. Bachmann, a four-term congresswoman who's been closely aligned with the tea party, sought the GOP presidential nomination in 2012. She's since been accused of campaign finance law violations, and is being investigated by the House Ethics Committee. That investigation, though, stops when she departs Congress in January. Bachmann also used the speech to thank her campaign's donors, Minnesota voters, her ""prayer warriors,"" her family, her staff, military veterans and God. But much of her speech was focused on the themes of God and the role of government -- where ""there are things"" that policy makers ""can't touch,"" she said, without delving into specifics. ""No government gave me rights that only God can give, and no government can take away the rights that only God can give,"" Bachmann said.","Rep.

"(CNN) -- Alarming findings related to women's safety have come to light with the release of a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey that looks at harassment on public transportation systems in the world's largest cities. According to the new report, six in 10 women in major Latin American cities report they've been physically harassed while using transport systems, with Bogota, Colombia, found to have the most unsafe public transportation, followed by Mexico City and Lima, Peru. At the other end of the safety spectrum, New York was rated as the best of the 16 cities studied followed by Tokyo, the world's largest capital with 38 million people, then Beijing and London. The poll was conducted in 15 of the world's largest capitals, as well as New York, the most populous city in the United States, in collaboration with UK polling company YouGov. Here are the results, from ranked from worst to best: . 1. Bogota, Colombia . 2. Mexico City . 3. Lima, Peru . 4. New Delhi . 5. Jakarta, Indonesia . 6. Buenos Aires . 7. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . 8. Bangkok . 9. Moscow . 10. Manila, Philippines . 11. Paris . 12. Seoul . 13. London . 14. Beijing . 15. Tokyo . 16. New York . In total, 6,555 women and experts were surveyed. Results are based on the respondents' answers as well as surveys of experts in women's rights, gender equality, urban planning and gender-friendly urban spaces in each of the cities. The Thomson Reuters Foundation said polling could not be conducted in five other large capitals -- Cairo, Dhaka (Bangladesh), Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Tehran and Baghad -- due to conflict or an inability by polling company YouGov to guarantee the necessary online sample of women. The group says it did survey 10 experts in Cairo, the world's fifth largest capital, but those findings were not included in the overall ranking as YouGov could not carry out the public poll. Had they been included, it would have put Cairo in the top five most dangerous transport systems, said the Thomson Reuters Foundation. What constitutes harassment? The foundation says the survey was conducted in many different cultures, and allowed respondents to judge what constituted harassment in their own society. Women were asked six questions relating to: how safe they felt traveling alone at night; the risk of being verbally harassed by men; the risk of being groped or subjected to other forms of physical harassment; trust that other passengers would assist a woman being physically or verbally abused; and trust in authorities to investigate reports of sexual harassment or violence. Have you been harassed? Share your experience in an open letter . In Moscow, respondents reportedly had little confidence that authorities would investigate an abuse report, while 85% of Paris women doubted fellow public transport users would come to their rescue if they were in trouble. In an accompanying Thompson Reuters Foundation report based on the survey, Mary Crass, head of policy at the International Transport Forum, an OECD think tank, said it was worrying that women were scared to use public transport in some major cities and the poll highlighted the need for more action. ""When there is not frequent, reliable, accessible transport, this can affect women and anyone's ability to access opportunity and notably employment in urban areas, which can make a big difference for women in particular,"" she said. ""(Women) tend to be more reliant on public transport and on non-motorized means, particularly in low-income or middle-income countries, in emerging economies."" Women-only cars a short-term fix, say experts . Tokyo's high standing may come as a surprise to those familiar with the highly publicized problems women have faced when riding Japanese subways, with widespread reports of groping consistently making headlines. The Thompson Reuters Foundation said experts attributed Tokyo's second place ranking to a raft of measures taken in the city over recent years to combat such incidents in often overcrowded buses and trains. These include the introduction of women-only trains in 2000, which are color-coded in pink, and transit police to enforce rules. Women-only sections on public transport are now also found in Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Delhi, Cairo and Manila. Thomson Reuters Foundation said other cities, including London, are considering this option and introducing CCTV on platforms and improving lighting. However, gender and city planning experts have raised concerns over whether women-only transport is effective. Julie Babinard, senior transport specialist from the World Bank, says they're a short term fix and not a panacea for harassment of women. ""The emerging interest in several countries on women-only initiatives should be seen as an opportunity for improving security in cities but not as a silver bullet for dealing with gender-based violence in transportation and urban settings,"" Babinard told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""Women-only initiatives are not likely to provide long-term solutions as they only segregate by gender and provide a short-term remedy instead of addressing more fundamental issues."" Although experts remain critical of single-sex transport, most women favored the idea, according to the survey.","Thomson Reuters Foundation says six in 10 women in major Latin American cities report having been physically harassed while using transport systems .

"(CNN) -- As wars become increasingly automated, we must ask ourselves how far we want to delegate responsibility to machines. Where do we want to draw the line? Weapons systems have been evolving for millennia and there have always been attempts to resist them. But does that mean that we should just sit back and accept our fate and hand over the ultimate responsibility for killing to machines? Over the last few months there has been an increasing debate about the use of fully autonomous robot weapons: armed robots that once launched can select their own targets and kill them without further human intervention. Some have argued that robots could be more accurate on the battlefield than human soldiers and save more civilian lives. But this is speculation based on assumptions about future developments of computer hardware and software. It is no more than ""hopeware"" -- since the 1950s, Artificial Intelligence has moved at a snail's pace compared to what proponents have predicted. Others argue that even if robots could be more accurate under some restricted circumstances at some unknown time in the future, we just shouldn't grant machines the decision about who lives or dies. At this point, we cannot rely on machines having the independent facility to conform to international law. Current sensing systems are not up to the task. And even if machines had adequate sensing mechanisms they would still be missing the vital components of battlefield awareness and common sense reasoning to make decisions about who and when it is appropriate to kill. Robots do not have the agency to decide if striking a target is proportional to the expected military advantage. There is no metric for this. Much of war is art and not science. A military commander must make a qualitative decision about the number of civilian lives that can be risked for a particular military objective. And that commander can be held accountable. A robot doesn't have the moral agency to be held accountable. Some would argue that the commander who sends a robot on a mission would be responsible (last point of contact). But that could be unfair since it could be the fault of the mission programmer, the manufacturer or one of dozens of little companies providing components. Maybe it should be the senior staff or policy makers who had the idea to use robots. Or the device could have been tampered with in the industrial supply chain or even damaged in action. Forensics are extremely difficult with such complex devices. Yet a recent U.S. DoD directive (November 2012) gives a green light to research and development of autonomous weapons systems while presenting a cautious route to their deployment. This is borne from a culmination of U.S. military road maps dating back to 2002 and it is a bad move. It sends the wrong message to other nations. As the most militarily advanced nation on the planet, the U.S. has the opportunity to take the take the lead in halting these developments. Thanks to the U.S.'s use of drones, more than 70 other countries have acquired the technology in a new arms race. It is simply blinkered to think that they will not follow suit with autonomous weapons. Is anyone thinking about how an adaptive enemy will exploit the weaknesses of robot weapons with spoofing, hacking or misdirection? Is anyone considering how unknown computer programs will interact when swarms of robots meet? Is anyone considering how autonomous weapons could destabilize world security and trigger unintentional wars? In April this year in London, a group of prominent NGOs will launch a large civil society campaign to ""Stop Killer Robots."" They are seeking a new legally binding preemptive international treaty to prohibit the development and deployment of fully autonomous robot weapons. The aim is to stop these weapons getting into the arsenals of the world's militaries while there is still an opportunity. Once there has been large national investments in the technology, it may be too late. Do you think autonomous robot weapons should be outlawed? Leave your comments below.

"(CNN) -- I'm a Generation X mom who works outside the home, and I've always felt strongly that women who have a choice about whether to work or stay home after having children should feel completely comfortable with either decision. Should a mom choose to work, her children will be fine as long as there's a good child care situation in place. You know the mantra, ""happy mommy (who wants to work), happy baby."" Based on that thinking, I have to say I was fairly blown away when I read one of the top findings of a new report by Working Mother Media, which examined the attitudes of millennials (born 1981 to 2000), Generation Xers (1965 to 1980) and baby boomers (1946 to 1964). Millennials scored highest, over Gen Xers and baby boomers, when asked whether they believe one parent should stay home to care for the children: Sixty percent of millennials said yes, vs. 55% for boomers and 50% for Gen Xers. What? Are we moving in the wrong direction here, ladies? Are we harkening back to an ""Ozzie and Harriet"" time when mom stayed at home, dad worked, and that was the complete family story? What millennial women want now . Jennifer Owens, editorial director of Working Mother Media, says no. She points to what else the millennials said in the survey of more than 2,000 moms and dads: that both parents should make a significant contribution to the household income, that mothers and fathers should share equally in daily household activities and that a mom who works outside the home sets a positive example for the children. ""I think many men and women want ... the ability to step in and out of their careers and not be stigmatized for it, and I think the millennials are saying this, too,"" said Owens, who notes that most millennials currently have children who are younger than those of of Gen Xers and baby boomers. ""Many men and women want to stay home with that little guy in the first years,"" she added. They're saying ""somebody should be home with that little tiny baby, but they do want a career."" In conversations with millennial moms across the country, I was struck by how much they believe the decision to work or stay at home is personal rather than political, how many would stay at home if they could and how they don't seem to feel the pressures of feminism driving their decisions. They are charting their own course. Moms 'opting in' to find work doors shut . Aliah Davis-McHenry, 33, president and chief executive officer of her own public relations firm, has two sons, ages 8 and 11. She's done it all: stayed at home when the boys were young, worked part-time and consulted during their preschool years and now works full-time from home, which means she can be there when her sons get off the school bus. ""I feel like it's a very personal decision,"" Davis-McHenry said. ""In a perfect world, with all the variables being aligned, who wouldn't want to be home every day? ... But that's not the world we live in."" Miriam Lane, 25, who works in sales for a television station in Huntsville, Alabama, says she or her husband could probably stay home with their 2-year-old daughter, but that wouldn't support the kind of lifestyle they want for their family. ""I think it's great if a parent can stay home,"" Lane said, ""but there are a lot of situations where it's just not feasible to be able to do that. I know specifically in our situation, we do have to have both parents working to be able to afford beyond just our basic needs."" Brace yourself, Mom: Millennials move back home . Christine Esposito's feelings are influenced by her own mom, who didn't work. ""I always had the image of me being like her and staying home,"" said Esposito, 30, who works in the e-learning field in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, and has a 2-year-old daughter. ""But I really feel like things have changed a lot,"" she added. ""I don't want to stay home and never be able to go out to dinner and never be able to go on vacation."" For Patricia Downs, a 31-year-old mom with a 2-year-old boy in day care, the issue is clear-cut: She thinks a parent should be home with the child, and she wishes it could be her. ""I think that's the best thing for my child,"" said Downs, an account manager in the cosmetics industry in Stony Point, New York. ""I feel like he misses out on time with myself, my husband. ... There are times he needs Mommy, and I'm just not able to go."" I wondered whether the views of millennials on this question of whether one parent should be home with a child were influenced either by their own upbringing as children of dual-income Gen Xers and boomers or by the experiences of people they know. Meghan Lodge, 24, whose daughter is just 8 weeks old, said her views are definitely shaped a bit by the childhood of some of her friends. ""I have some older friends who ... had to stay in day care, or they had to come home by themselves"" when they were older, Lodge said. The Thomasville, Georgia, woman believes that one parent should stay home with the child if they can afford it. ""I mean, they turned out fine, but they always talked about how much they wished they had more time with their parents."" Survey: Reluctant breadwinner moms are less happy . Beyond the question of working versus staying at home as parents, millennials told us something else in this survey: that they are a whole lot happier than previous generations (PDF). They reported more satisfaction with their jobs, their family finances and their relationship with their partners than Gen Xers and baby boomers. ""I think we're more motivated towards achieving satisfaction and balance,"" Davis-McHenry said. ""I don't think it's only about making money. I believe it's more about fulfillment: feeling like we're making a difference and making sure that everything from home to work, those needs are being satisfied, and I think that's what's making us happier."" Many millennial moms say they are thankful to the women who came before them, the Gen Xers and baby boomers, who broke down barriers, allowing them to make the choices they want to make for their lives. But at the same time, they don't seem to feel any of the pressures of fulfilling anyone's expectations other than their own. ""We do things more according to what we see fit for our family, what's best for the family, rather than what other people think about it,"" Lodge said. Owens, of Working Mother, believes that this optimism on the part of millennials has definite implications for the workplace. ""They're going to demand more. They're already asking questions about the 24/7 always on (work life),"" said Owens, herself a Gen Xer. ""They're asking for flexibility already as a given, and you know what, they're not even asking for it. They just expect it. And amen to them."" From this Gen Xer as well, amen indeed! Do you think one parent should stay home to care for the children?

"Auburn, Maine (CNN) -- A quiet lobbying campaign by a low-key man from Maine could determine which party controls the Senate next year. Sen. Angus King, a Maine Independent, is holding private conversations with Independent Senate candidates to urge them against siding with Democrats or Republicans before the election. In a narrowly divided Senate, this group of Independents could tip the balance of power -- and wield tremendous clout. ""If you announce in advance which party you're going to caucus with, you may as well just sign up and say I'm one or the other,"" King told CNN. King recently advised Independent Kansas Senate candidate Greg Orman on how to be most effective running outside the two party system. Another Independent candidate, Larry Pressler of South Dakota, got similar pointers from King, who strongly suggested that Pressler evade questions about which party he he will caucus with -- just as King did when he first ran for the Senate two years ago. After his 2012 election as an Independent, King decided to caucus with Democrats, who currently control the Senate. But he's taking the same advice he's giving the candidates, refusing to rule out joining Republicans if they capture the Senate. ""I'm not going to answer that question,"" King said. ""I'll make that decision at the time based upon what i think is in the best interest of Maine."" He added: ""My first priority is to try to make the Senate work better and to the extent that as an Independent I can help to do that, that's my goal,"" said King. King admitted he has been in talks with other moderate Senators in both parties for ""the past six months or so"" to form a centrist caucus. However, he said it would be an informal group, and he does not envision breaking away any time soon from organizing around the two parties, as the Senate does now. POWER OF THE INDEPENDENT . When King got to the Senate in 2013 there was only one other Independent, Bernie Sanders, a proud progressive who knows how to work across the aisle, like negotiating a Veterans Affairs overhaul. But Sanders has always caucused with Democrats. It used to be that Independents were titling at windmills, almost sure to lose to either the Democratic or Republican candidates. ""The hardest thing for an Independent is to get across an invisible credibility line and they're not wasting their vote,"" said King. But he crossed that invisible line in part because he had proven himself as a successful Independent governor here, but also because people were so desperate to send an alternative to Washington. ""When I was campaigning in Maine two years ago and people came up to me on the street they never started the conversation with health care, the Affordable Care Act, Syria, or anything else. What they started with was 'why can't those people down there talk to each other and get something done?'"" recalled King. That overriding disgust appears more potent in 2014. Strategists in both parties say their data show the most effective candidates this election year are those who can genuinely separate themselves from today's partisan politics. That's why candidates like Orman, and to a lesser extent Pressler, a former Republican, are doing well, and Independent candidates in other states are doing well enough to make an impact on their races. ""What I think it says is that the public is tired of the choices that they're being given and they're very tired of the gridlock and they're looking for alternatives,"" King told us. KING DID NOT ENDORSE FELLOW INDEPENDENT . Orman is running in a tight race against sitting Sen. Pat Roberts. King told CNN that in his conversation with Orman, he explained that he couldn't provide an endorsement because he made a pledge not to campaign against a sitting colleague. Still, he told Orman that he was happy to give him advice and is encouraged by his strong Independent candidacy. And while King is careful to say he is not sure there is a major trend towards Independent candidates quite yet, he openly dreams of Orman and Pressler actually winning and what that would mean for the future of Independents in politics. ""It's going to encourage other people in other states who are going to say 'look there are guys in the Senate who are doing this and it's not unthinkable. They're getting these done,"" said King. INDEPENDENT - SPOILER? The reality is that Independent candidates in most campaigns still register in single digits at best, and are viewed by party leaders as mere spoilers taking away votes from GOP or Democratic candidates. In the governors race here in Maine, if incumbent Republican Paul LaPage wins, he can likely thank Independent Eliot Cutler for pulling votes away from Democrat Michael Michaud. ""I prefer the term winner to the term spoiler,"" King said generally of the sentiment. ""There is always a risk but you can't calculate these kinds of things. you gotta say who is the best candidate,"" he added, perhaps wishfully. WATCH: All eyes on S. Dakota, Kansas, Georgia .","Angus King is urging Independent Senate candidates against siding with either party .

"(CNN) -- Skiing superstar Lindsey Vonn led an historic sweep of a World Cup podium for the United States with a stunning comeback victory in the downhill at Lake Louise Saturday. Vonn has endured a miserable 22 months since sustaining career-threatening injuries in a high speed crash at the world championships in February 2013, but returned to the top of the podium with a commanding performance in the Canadian Rockies. A promising eighth in Friday's opening downhill at the resort, Vonn called on all her experience on the slope to record a time of one minute 50.48 seconds. It left her 0.49 seconds ahead of teammate Stacey Cook, with Julia Mancuso in third completing a triumphant race for the American team, the first time it has achieved such a feat at this level. It was the 12th World Cup downhill victory for Vonn, who was unable to defend her 2010 Olympic downhill title at the Sochi Games earlier this year because of her injuries. ""I am extremely happy to be on top of the podium again and also with my two teammates. It couldn't be a better day,"" she told the official FIS website. Vonn is nicknamed ""Lake Lindsey"" because of her liking for racing at this venue, wrapping up her 15th victory there in all disciplines since her first win in 2004. ""I think I am as much excited for the whole experience of the three of us being on the podium as I am for myself,"" said the improving Cook. Stefan Abplanalp, who coaches the U.S. squad in the speed disciplines, said their hard work ahead of the season had paid off. ""I'm very proud of the team. They really succeeded and achieved their goals. It was a pretty big day for the U.S. Ski Team, with a podium sweep,"" he told CNN. Vonn's boyfriend Tiger Woods, who has been battling fever and indifferent form on his comeback to golf after injury, summed up their respective fortunes on Twitter. ""I competed and Linds won,"" he posted. Slovenia's Tina Maze, who jointly claimed Vonn's Olympic title with Switzerland's Dominique Gisin in Sochi, had won Friday's opener, but could only manage eighth in the second race. Gisin was back in 29th as she battles to return to her gold medal form. Vonn can also gain encouragement from her second place in the super-G competition Sunday which concluded the weekend's racing at Lake Louise. She was edged out by Olympic bronze downhill medallist Lara Gut with World Cup overall points leader Maze in third to complete her fine weekend.","Lindsey Vonn wins World Cup downhill at Lake Louise .

"Diepsloot, South Africa (CNN) -- In a country where several rapes are said to occur every minute, in a township where violence is commonplace, this was a crime that shocked the entire community of Diepsloot, South Africa. Two girl cousins, aged two and three, were taken from their doorstep -- kidnapped in broad daylight. And when Yonelisa and Zandile Mali were found a few days later in the township north of Johannesburg, the news only got worse. The two girls had been raped and murdered, their lifeless bodies dumped in a public toilet in Diepsloot. Pistorius case brings South Africa gun culture to global spotlight . Since that discovery October 15, five men have been accused of kidnapping, raping and killing the two little girls. The suspects appeared briefly in court in Pretoria Thursday but the trial has been adjourned until November 1 while investigations continue, Medupe Simasiku, a spokesman for South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority, told CNN. Investigators are currently analyzing DNA evidence and awaiting official identification of the five men, he said. A confession from one of the suspects was legally obtained and will be used in court, according to Simasiku, but the other suspects have not confessed to the alleged crimes. All five will defend themselves in court. Residents of Diepsloot demonstrated outside Pretoria Magistrate's Court as the men made their appearance, voicing their anger over the killings. The sprawling, densely populated township on the outskirts of Johannesburg is one of the most violent places in the country, making it a challenge for any parent to keep their child safe here. But Yonelisa's mother, Thokozani Mali, tried her best. She was at home with the girls on the day they were taken, checking on them every five minutes as they played together. Why brutality is ingrained in psyche of South Africa . She discovered they'd vanished after going to check when all went quiet. Family, neighbors and the police joined a frantic hunt for the toddlers. Ten days after their bodies were found, Thokozani finds it hard to talk about the loss of her only child. ""I am trying to be strong,"" she told CNN. ""When I am sleeping, she always next to me, so when I think of that I feel like crying."" A box of the girls' shoes is outside her home, waiting to be given away to those in need. But for the moment, the pain is still too raw. 'Gruesome incidents' South African President Jacob Zuma last week condemned the girls' murder, as well as the apparent torture and abuse of a young boy whose body was found in a field in Katlehong, east of Johannesburg. ""These gruesome incidents of extreme torture and murder of our children do not belong to the society that we are continuously striving to build together,"" he said in a statement. ""Whilst we appeal to the communities not to take the matters into their hands, we also want to urge them to work with law enforcement authorities to find the perpetrators and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law."" Arrests for rape are rare in South Africa, and only 6% of rape cases lead to convictions. But rape itself is far from uncommon. South Africa has one of the highest rates of sexual violence in the world, with an average of 55,000 reported cases a year. The true figure is likely much higher, though, since many victims stay silent, according to Prof. Rachel Jewkes of the South African Medical Research Council. Surveys of adult women in South Africa's Gauteng province, which encompasses Johannesburg, Diepsloot and Pretoria, suggest that 25 women are raped for each one who reports it to the police, she said. ""If you take into account that rape is so under-reported, there are several rapes every minute in this country by our estimate,"" she said. While some 60% of the women raped in South Africa are adults, about 15% are children under the age of 11, she said. ""We do see rapes of children of age 3 and 2 every year but obviously not that many,"" Jewkes said. She has seen a disturbing increase in cases where those attacked are both raped and killed. About a quarter of girl children who are murdered are raped, Jewkes said. The police station in Diepsloot has one of the highest rates of reported rapes in the country, she said. She believes that to change this, authorities will need to tackle the root causes -- poverty, lack of policing, and the problem of men's attitude of sexual entitlement toward women.

CNN's Karen Smith contributed to this report.","Two toddlers aged 2 and 3 were kidnapped, raped and killed in Dietsloop township .

"(CNN) -- Fifteen years ago, men who were suffering from impotence received a beacon of hope in the form of a little blue pill. Wednesday marks the 15th anniversary of Viagra's FDA approval in the United States. Viagra currently holds 45% of the sexual dysfunction market share, with competitor Cialis in close second, according to industry researcher IMS Health. There were 8 million Viagra prescriptions written in 2012 with total sales of about $2 billion. But how did a drug that was originally tested for the treatment of heart problems end up in bedrooms across America? Take a look back at Viagra's history. 1989:  British Pfizer scientists Peter Dunn and Albert Wood create a drug called sildenafil citrate that they believe will be useful in treating high blood pressure and angina, a chest pain associated with coronary heart disease. The drug is classified as UK-92480. 1991: Dr. Nicholas Terrett is named in the British patent for sildenafil citrate, or Viagra, as a heart medication. Terrett is often considered the father of Viagra, according to ViagraBox.com. Early 1990s: Pfizer completes several early trials of sildenafil citrate that provide little hope for its use as a heart disease treatment. But volunteers in the clinical trials are reporting increased erections several days after taking a dose of the drug, according to researcher Ian Osterloh. ""Around the same time, other studies were revealing more information about the biochemical pathway involved in the erection process,"" he writes for Cosmos magazine. ""This helped us understand how the drug might amplify the effects of sexual stimulation in opening up the blood vessels in the penis. With UK-92480â€²s chances of treating angina now slim, we decided to run pilot studies in patients with erectile dysfunction."" Testosterone: 'Viagra for the boardroom' 1996: Pfizer patents sildenafil citrate in the United States. March 1998: The FDA approves the use of the drug Viagra to treat erectile dysfunction. In the following weeks, experts estimate, U.S. pharmacists dispense more than 40,000 Viagra prescriptions. May 1998: TIME magazine's cover story, ""The Potency Pill"" quotes Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione as saying he believes Viagra will ""free the American male libido"" from the emasculating doings of feminists. Feminists are not amused. On CNN's Larry King Live show, former presidential nominee Bob Dole admits he took part in experimental trials for Viagra, calling it ""a great drug."" June 1998: Newsweek calls Viagra the ""hottest new drug in history almost everywhere in the world."" At the time Viagra is only legal in the United States, Brazil, Morocco and Mexico, but Newsweek reports growing black market sales in other countries. December 1998: Pfizer announces it has hired Bob Dole for a television campaign aimed at raising awareness of male impotence. The Washington Post reports that the CIA is using Viagra to gain friends in Afghanistan. ""While the CIA has a long history of buying information with cash, the growing Taliban insurgency has prompted the use of novel incentives and creative bargaining to gain support in some of the country's roughest neighborhoods, according to officials directly involved in such operations."" July 25, 1999: Popular TV show ""Sex and the City"" airs ""The Man, The Myth, The Viagra,"" in which character Samantha dates a wealthy older man who uses the little blue pills. In the next season, Samantha takes the little blue pill herself to enhance her sexual experiences. PE: The 'other' male sexual problem . 2000: Dr. Sanjay Kaul presents research at the 49th Annual Scientific Session of the American College of Cardiology that suggests 522 patients died while taking Viagra in the first year the drug was on the market. ""Our data appear to suggest that there's a relatively high number of deaths and adverse cardiovascular events associated with the use of Viagra. I want to emphasize that in no way are we trying to imply a cause-and-effect relationship,"" Kaul told WebMD at the time. August 19, 2003: The FDA approves Bayer Corporation's vardenafil hydrochloride, sold under the brand name Levitra, to treat erectile dysfunction in men. November 21, 2003: The FDA approves pharmaceutical company Lilly USA's tadalafil, or Cialis, for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The side effects for Cialis are similar to Viagra, and men with heart problems or abnormal blood pressure are advised against taking it. 2006: Rush Limbaugh is detained at a Florida airport after a bottle of Viagra is found in his luggage. The name on the prescription bottle does not match his. Limbaugh's attorney says his doctor had prescribed the Viagra under a different name ""for privacy purposes,"" according to Forbes. 2010: Actor Michael Douglas makes headlines when he admits to AARP magazine that he has used erectile dysfunction drugs with wife, actress Catherine Zeta-Jones. ""Bless her that she likes older guys,"" he says. ""Some wonderful enhancements have happened in the last few years -- Viagra, Cialis -- that can make us all feel younger."" 2011: A federal judge extends Pfizer's U.S. patent for Viagra, making sure generic brands cannot come to market until 2019, according to the Wall Street Journal. April 2012: The FDA approves a new erectile dysfunction drug called avanafil, which will be sold under the brand name Stendra.

"(CNN) -- The pictures might be NSFW -- at least if you're looking at them over lunch -- but Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson was certainly working it on Sunday. Donning red lipstick, a flight attendant's skirt and high heels, the maverick businessman served drinks, made intercom announcements and chatted up passengers on an AirAsia X flight from Perth, Australia, to Kuala Lumpur. A little recap. Two years ago, Branson and AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes wagered on their Formula 1 racing teams, each man betting his own team would finish ahead of the other's in the 2010 Formula 1 Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi. The loser would have to serve as a female flight attendant on the winner's airline. Branson lost. On Sunday, he honored the bet by serving on a special AirAsia X charity flight. Branson wore heavy makeup, including fake eyelashes and bright red lipstick. At a cocktail event in Perth the night before the flight, he had his legs shaved, but managed to keep his mustache. ""This has been a real first for me but I have enjoyed the experience and I have nothing but respect for what our fabulous flight attendants do every day to keep us safe,"" said Branson after the flight. ""He is an entrepreneur, visionary, knight and adventurer, Sir Richard can now also add AirAsia flight attendant to his long list of credentials,"" joked Fernandes. During the five-and-a-half-hour flight, Branson poured coffee and tea, served meals, distributed merchandise, made in-flight announcements and entertained the passengers, according to an AirAsia statement. He also accidentally (read: deliberately) tipped a tray of drinks over Fernandes during the flight. The two are close friends. For each seat sold for the event, AirAsia X is donating A$100 ($100) to Starlight Children's Foundation, an Australia-based organization dedicated to seriously ill and hospitalized children and their families. The event raised approximately $200,000 for the charity.","Virgin Group chairman and founder Sir Richard Branson honored a lost bet by serving as flight attendant on AirAsia X .

"(CNN) -- President Obama on Wednesday called for a reform of the much-maligned federal earmarking process. President Obama says future earmarks should be made public on lawmakers' Web sites. Earmarks are unrelated pet projects that members of Congress insert in spending bills. The president maintained that earmarks can serve a useful purpose, but he said it is time for Congress and the White House to embrace a new set of guiding principles. His remarks came the day after the Senate passed a $410 billion spending bill that included nearly 9,000 earmarks, which are projects designed to benefit individual legislators' districts. The earmarks in the spending bill are worth nearly $8 billion. Many critics have deemed them as wasteful, and some observers have questioned Obama's pledge to end such spending. Some lawmakers urged Obama to veto the bill -- saying it goes against the president's campaign pledge.  Watch what's in the spending bill » . Obama said that while he would sign the bill, which funds the government for the remainder of the current fiscal year, future earmarks should ""have a legitimate and worthy public purpose."" CNNMoney: The truth about earmarks . Earmarks sought by members of Congress, he said in an appearance at the White House, should be aired on those lawmakers' Web sites in advance ""so the public and the press can examine them and judge their merit for themselves."" Each earmark, he added, also should ""be open to scrutiny at public hearings, where members will have to justify their expense to the taxpayer."" The president also said that any earmark benefiting a for-profit private company ""should be subject to the same competitive bidding requirements as other federal contracts."" ""The awarding of earmarks to private companies is the single most corrupting element of this practice,"" he said. ""Private companies differ from the public entities that Americans rely on every day -- schools, police stations, fire departments -- and if they are seeking taxpayer dollars, then they should be evaluated with a higher level of scrutiny."" Obama added that earmarks should ""never, ever be traded for political favors."" The president pledged to seek to eliminate any future earmark that has ""no legitimate public purpose."" Obama has broken with many of his more conservative critics in opposing an elimination of the earmarking process. If done right, he argued Wednesday, earmarks ""give legislators the opportunity to direct federal money to worthy projects that benefit people in their district, and that's why I have opposed their outright elimination."" He conceded, however, that some earmarks ""have been used as a vehicle for waste, fraud and abuse. Projects have been inserted at the eleventh hour, without review, and sometimes without merit, in order to satisfy the political or personal agendas of a given legislator, rather than the public interest."" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, called Obama's earmark announcement an ""opportunity missed."" ""The president's rhetoric is impressive, but his statement affirms we will continue to do business as usual in Washington regarding earmarks in appropriations legislation,"" McCain said in a statement. ""The president could have resolved this issue in one statement -- no more unauthorized pork barrel projects -- and pledged to use his veto pen to stop them."" White House officials have tried to dismiss the current spending bill legislation as ""last year's business"" that Obama is dealing with reluctantly. Top Democrats, including House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland, have suggested lawmakers do not appreciate being dictated to on an issue that is a congressional prerogative. Asked last week about the administration's plan to put forth guidelines to overhaul earmarks, Hoyer said flatly, ""I don't think the White House has the ability to tell us what to do."" He paused and quipped to reporters, ""I hope you all got that down."" Obama's budget director made a vow Sunday that the president will bring a halt to pork-laden bills. ""[Such bills] will not happen when the president has the full legislative and appropriations process in place,"" Peter Orszag, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told CNN's ""State of the Union With John King."" He argued that the White House had little choice but to support the omnibus spending bill, which it inherited from the previous administration. ""This is like your relief pitcher coming into the ninth inning and wanting to redo the whole game,"" Orszag said. ""Next year we're going to be the starting pitcher, and the game's going to be completely different."" But House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, rejected this argument and said that Obama had vowed to take action against earmarks during the presidential campaign. ""If you make a promise, people expect that you live up to it. And that's why this administration's refusal to go in and change this bill, I think, is a false position,"" Cantor told ""State of the Union."" ""There is no way anyone could take what Mr. Orszag has said with any credibility."" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Tuesday that Obama can't just say the bill is last year's business. ""I've asked the president to veto this bill,"" he said. ""Listen, this is a new Congress, and this is a new president."" CNN's Ed Henry contributed to this report.","NEW: Earmarks must have ""legitimate and worthy public purpose,"" president says .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. airstrikes have killed two top-level and one mid-level ISIS leader, a senior U.S. military official tells CNN. Haji Mutazz was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's deputy in Iraq; Abd al Basit was his military emir in Iraq; and Radwan Talib was his Mosul emir. Their deaths resulted from multiple strikes going back to mid-November -- it has taken until now to determine conclusively they were killed. Obama says U.S. 'hammering' ISIS . ""I can confirm that since mid-November, targeted coalition airstrikes successfully killed multiple senior and mid-level leaders within the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant,"" said Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby, in a statement on Thursday. ""We believe that the loss of these key leaders degrades ISIL's ability to command and control current operations against Iraqi Security Forces, including Kurdish and other local forces in Iraq,"" he said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Japan women's national football team will square off against favorites the United States Sunday in their first appearance in a World Cup final. Regardless of the result, Japan's surprise progress in Germany is a much-needed boost for a country recently devastated by massive tremors and a subsequent tsunami. It is also putting women's sport in the shop window like never before. ""This is a breath of fresh air, because everything out of Japan has been negative over the last few months,"" said Tom Byer, a youth soccer instructor in Japan for over 25 years and former soccer instructor of starter Aya Miyama. ""Now, you turn on every channel and there are big segments about women's soccer... it's huge for women's sports here."" Can World Cup spark women's soccer surge? Known as Nadeshiko -- or beautiful flower in Japanese -- the women's national team has been the underdog throughout this year's tournament. They are unlikely to relinquish this role in Sunday's final in Frankfurt, with a star-studded and battle tested U.S. squad -- which took home the cup in 1991 and 1999 -- standing in their way. But what many people may not know, Byer said, is that the Japanese squad has enjoyed a high level of success on the international scene over the last 20 years. In addition to their fourth-place showing at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Nadeshiko has appeared in each of the six women's World Cups since 1991, and are coming off a recent win at the 2010 Asia Games held in Guangzhou, China. Yet their success has not had a significant impact on the women's game generally in Japan. ""Women's soccer is grossly underfunded,"" said Byer, who once played in Japan's professional soccer league. ""It wasn't until five or six years ago that the Japanese Football Association (JFA) got together and decided to put more resources behind women's soccer."" He added that recent success from Japan's national team has not increased the number of young girls interested in playing organized soccer. There are just 25,000 girls registered to play youth soccer in Japan, a country of more than 125 million people, Byer said. This compares to around 200,000 girls registered with the American Youth Soccer Organization in the U.S. State of California alone. So why are Japanese women enjoying such a successful period? ""It's not like New York, where you play soccer from the summertime until Thanksgiving,"" Byer said. ""In Japan, you play 365 days a year and you play only one sport. And you train and train until you fall down."" But the culture of sport in Japan is far different that in the U.S., Byer said. Women's youth soccer in the U.S., especially for girls under 12, is ""purely recreational,"" he said. In Japan ""they are already trying to find who can be on the national team at the age of 12."" Watching the final game? Send us video of your viewing parties. Unlike the U.S. Women's Professional Soccer League, Japan's L. League is non-professional. In fact, many of the league's players work normal day jobs to pay their bills. ""Aya [Miyama] and some of the other players from the team are from Mimasaka, a hot spring town. A lot of those women work in the hot spring resort hotels during the day, after the job they go and train,"" said Byer. Andrew McKirdy, a sports writer for the Japan Times, an English language newspaper in Japan, said the success of the women's national soccer team has reinvigorated a nation plagued by recent tragedy. ""The women take a lot of pride in the fact that everything is staked against them,"" he said. ""Looking at Germany and Sweden -- the last two teams they beat -- those teams are among the best in the world...that is a source of inspiration for the country."" The time difference with Germany has made watching this year's World Cup difficult for many Japanese fans, and the final match -- broadcast at 3:15 a.m. in Japan -- is no different. Nonetheless, diehard Nadeshiko fans are expected to crowd Tokyo's sports bars, cheering on their ladies as they reach for history. ""I'm so happy. I was moved very much that Nadeshiko Japan played such a great game,"" one Japanese male fan told CNN, following the team's semifinals win against Sweden. ""I want Nadeshiko to let us dream again at the final game."" For Byer, a Bronx-native, the outcome of Sunday's U.S.-Japan final is less important than the buzz Nadeshiko has already generated in Japan about women's sport. ""It's going to lift the whole nation if they win the World Cup,"" Byer said. ""Even if they don't, the fact that they got to the final has had a residual effect in Japan... winning it would just be the icing on the cake."" CNN's Junko Ogura and Kotoe Oshima contributed to this report.","The Japan women's national soccer team is also known as Nadeshiko -- or beautiful flower in Japanese .

"Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has notified Congress of plans to allow women to serve aboard submarines, a Defense Department official said Tuesday. Letters of intent were sent Monday to Congress, which has requested briefings on the matter, said the official, who asked not to be identified. There will be no vote on the matter in Congress. The change was recommended by the chief of naval operations and the secretary of the Navy in addition to Gates, the official said, adding that there was no opposition to the move among Navy leaders. A phased approach is being considered under which officers -- who already have separate living quarters -- would be the first to go co-ed, followed by crews, with the women bunking together, the official said. Crew space would have to be modified prior to that happening, the official added. The submarines expected to carry women initially would be the larger ones -- nuclear-powered, missile-carrying submarines known as SSBN and SSGN, the official said. Women joined the crews of the Navy's surface ships in 1993, but officials had previously cited limited privacy and the cost of reconfiguring the vessels in arguing against their joining sub crews. Last September, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead described himself as ""very comfortable addressing integrating women into the submarine force."" ""Accommodations are a factor, but not insurmountable,"" he said.","DoD official: Letters of intent sent to Congress, which has requested briefings .

"(CNN) -- Jacques Villeneuve has not competed in the Indy 500 since his 1995 triumph in one of motor sport's most iconic events but at the age of 42 the Canadian will return to the famous Brickyard for this year's race. Villeneuve will drive for the Schmidt Peterson Motorsports team and, if he qualifies for the race proper on May 25, he will set a new record for the biggest gap between starts, the 19 years surpassing the old mark of 17, jointly held by Cy Marshall and Roland Free between 1930 and 1947. Villeneuve went on to claim the 1995 IndyCar season championship before moving to Formula One, claiming the 1997 world title and a total of 11 wins from 34 grand prix starts. Currently an F1 commentator as well as competing in World Rallycross, Villeneuve said he was excited by the prospect of another chance of Indy 500 glory. ""To have the opportunity to return to IndyCar racing and the Indianapolis 500 is something I never thought possible,"" Villeneuve told his official website. ""The memories I have there will stay with me for the rest of my life, and I'm excited to create new memories in 2014."" Villeneueve will partner the ambitious team's full-time IndyCar drivers Simon Pagenaud of France and Mikhail Aleshin of Russia for the 500-mile (800 km) race on the 2.5 mile (4km) circuit in Indianapolis. Team principal Sam Schmidt said the acquisition of Villeneuve underlined their ambition as they enter just their third season in IndyCar. ""We're very pleased to have a driver of the caliber of Jacques in our lineup in May,"" Schmidt said. ""He's a former winner in the event and brings tremendous experience from his success in the world's top racing series."" Co-owner Ric Peterson was in the crowd when Villeneuve won the the Indy 500 in 1995. ""Having grown up in Canada, the name Villeneuve is synonymous with winning. and Jacques being the only Canadian to win that huge event, it gave me a huge sense of national pride,"" he said. Villeneuve's father Gilles won six races during a brief but storied F1 career - until losing his life in an accident at the Belgian Grand Prix in 1982. His son inherited his flair for motor sport and upon graduating to the IndyCar series in 1994 made an early impression by being named Rookie of the Year. His 1995 triumphs made him hot property and he was signed by the then dominant Williams team for the 1996 F1 season, finishing runner-up in the title race to teammate Damon Hill of Britain. The next season came his title success after a titanic battle with Germany's Michael Schumacher, the seven-time world F1 champion. It was to prove the pinnacle of his career and after leaving Williams to drive with BAR, Renault and Sauber, Villeneuve switched to NASCAR racing in 2007. He is one of only two drivers to have competed in IndyCar, NASCAR Sprint Cup and Formula One. The other, Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is returning to IndyCar for the 2014 season with Team Penske. ""I've been fortunate enough to compete in several of the world's top racing series, and nothing excites me more than entering the IndyCar series at its current level of competitiveness,"" Villeneuve said. Villeneuve's place in Indy 500 history is already assured after his epic drive to win in 1995. He recovered from a mid-race two-lap penalty to beat Brazilian Christian Fittipaldi by over two seconds. He is likely to be joined on the start line by three-time winner Helio Castroneves of Brazil, two-time winner Scott Dixon of New Zealand, Montoya, who won in 2000, and Brazil's Tony Kanaan, the defending champion. If he was to enter Victory Lane, Villeneuve would break Al Unser's record for the longest gap between first and last victories. Unser went 17 years between his 1970 and 1987 triumphs.","Jacques Villeneuve to race at this year's Indy 500 .

"(CNN) -- In 2007, when the London property market was booming and former headhunter Kristian Jeffrey was between jobs, he received an interesting request. ""I was asked to put ads on the pavement in front of (real) estate agents' offices,"" he said. Advertising was something he'd started thinking about in his already budding entrepreneurial streak. Gumtree -- the UK equivalent of Craigslist -- the free online classifieds where viewers can buy and sell almost anything, wanted to do a ""clean advertising"" campaign in seven UK cities. The goal was to get consumers to advertise directly through Gumtree instead of going through a real estate agent. The ads were literally cleaned onto dirty pavement at target locations. ""It was cheeky, a bit more edgy than the normal campaign,"" said Jeffrey. ""I'm not sure they (real estate agents) appreciated it."" The campaign went extremely well, sales of homes advertised directly on Gumtree went up by 800%, he said. What happened next was an explosion of media attention. One thing led to another and he found himself doing campaigns for ING Bank in the Netherlands and Belgium, among others. Jeffrey says those jobs let him grow his ""Street Advertising Services,"" a company focusing on outdoor advertising campaigns including 3D street art, street graffiti and grass advertising. One of its best-known campaigns was the ""World's Biggest Shave,"" a giant Roger Federer face spray painted on a hill in Wimbledon for Gillette. The business has grown swiftly and this year Jeffrey decided he needed to hire an experienced sales director and also move his Midlands-based company to a bigger office to house his dozen employees. Before doing this: ""I wanted to make sure we had the money in the bank,"" explained Jeffrey. Local banks didn't seem to grasp his business plan, he said. So in August he put his company on Funding Circle -- the largest peer-to-peer business lender in the United Kingdom -- applied for £40,000 ($70,000), watched investors bid and within days he had his loan. It has a 9% interest rate, he says, as opposed to the commercial banks who wanted to charge 10-13%. There are many different models of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, but essentially P2P websites let businesses borrow money directly from individuals, without going through a traditional financial institution such as a bank. Funding Circle has 5,500 businesses registered and has lent more than £300 million ($488 million) since it started. The company is projecting massive growth. While banks still provide the majority of lending in the United Kingdom -- over 85% -- Funding Circle is confident it can seize a big percentage of that. ""We look to take a large chunk of that over the next five to 10 years,"" said Natasha Jones, a company spokeswoman. Funding Circle says the P2P business lending industry is tripling in size every year, and has the potential to be worth over £12 billion ($19.5 billion) a year in the United Kingdom in the next 10 years, according to research by Nesta, a charity focused on innovative businesses and ideas. Lending Club and Prosper are the two largest P2P lenders in the United States, with a majority of the market. They issued $2.4 billion in loans in 2013, up significantly from $871 million in 2012. What's more, a recent report by venture capital firm Foundation Capital predicts the global market for P2P lending could be worth over $1 trillion by 2025. Different P2P websites advertise different levels of returns, but Funding Circle said whether it's a small one-off investment (there is a £20 ($34) minimum) or a large investment from a savvy lender, the net return on average is about 6.4% after fees and bad debt are accounted for. Bad debt is a hazard of this kind of lending, as is the possibility that the P2P website itself will go bust, but the industry is becoming increasingly regulated and P2P services include various risk mitigation systems. ""There is a risk. It's an investment product, not a savings product,"" said Jones. Despite this, many investors want to lend locally, or support a particular industry or an ethical business and can do this easily in the P2P model, she said. For another creative company, it was a matter of cash flow and not being paid on time which prompted it to look at another P2P lender, MarketInvoice. This online marketplace allows businesses to ""auction"" their invoices to investors, who bid to provide capital against the as-yet-unpaid earnings. London-based Cada Design Group, an interior and graphic design company for the food and beverage industry, said it turned to MarketInvoice in 2012 as a way to get finance against its design invoices. ""We've always looked at various forms of funding apart from conventional banking. But unfortunately in the design business, because we're not doing anything tangible, our services are time and ideas,"" said Ashley Smith, financial director for Cada Design. ""MarketInvoice was the first company that came up with a viable option and said 'you can sell your invoices and release that cash very, very quickly',"" said Smith. Cada Design, whose client list is long and includes major UK brands Pret A Manger, Boots and Marks & Spencer, as well as Dean & Deluca gourmet food shop in the United States, said facing late payments from clients in its business ""could be catastrophic."" ""People still don't pay their bills on time, but it (P2P) has given us an avenue to remove that stress,"" said Smith. ""It's our painkiller.""","Peer-to-peer finance lets businesses bypass bank loans .

"(CNN) -- Right now, two-thirds of Americans are suffering from ""Fear-bola,"" according to a new Washington Post poll. It's a hyper-contagious disease that affects the brain, making sufferers fear a widespread Ebola outbreak in the United States. Fear-bola is an airborne disease that spreads through conversation, entering your brain through your ears. Fear-bola is so contagious that some victims have contracted it by simply seeing images and videos about Ebola. Once inside your body, Fear-bola attacks the part of the brain responsible for rational thinking. It starts with a low-grade concern about the two health care workers diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas and slowly builds into fear of a widespread epidemic in the United States. Almost half of the people affected by Fear-bola are also ""very"" or ""somewhat"" worried they themselves will catch the virus. Fear-bola is dangerous because it leads to confused decision-making and illusions. People who favor travel bans, for example, suffer from Fear-bola. Anyone convinced Ebola is an airborne virus is suffering from the disease. If the news that a second health care worker in Dallas diagnosed with Ebola made you think you're in a real-life ""Contagion"" or ""Outbreak"" movie, you suffer from Fear-bola. Fear-bola can also affect institutions. Navarro College, a small community college outside Dallas, has contracted Fear-bola and has stopped accepting students from countries with confirmed cases of Ebola, according to The Daily Beast. Navarro has rejected every student application from Nigeria, a country with 174 million people and 20 cases of Ebola. By the way, after ""world-class epidemiological detective work,"" that outbreak was traced back to a Liberian-American. Nigeria is five days away from being declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organization. To put this story in perspective, it would be like Harvard suddenly sending rejection letters to every high school applicant from Texas, stating: ""Unfortunately Harvard is not accepting applications from students in states with confirmed cases of Ebola."" As you can see, Fear-bola is extremely dangerous at an institutional level because it leads to widespread discrimination. I almost caught Fear-bola from a good friend when he told me: ""You better believe I'm worried about Ebola. Sure, the docs say, 'Don't worry. It's not airborne. You must touch fluid to get it' ... but what if a person on plane or subway sneezes, sending fluid particles at me or a few drops on the seat. ... That's not airborne to docs ... but that's fluid and now I have Ebola. Yeah, I'm very afraid."" That was all it took to contract Fear-bola. Suddenly, I felt the urge to Google ""how far does a sneeze travel?"" (It's 200 feet, by the way.) Once you contract Fear-bola, you can't help but spread it to others. After talking to my friend, I called my mom -- who luckily gave me a dose of common sense. As she put it, ""I don't know what everyone is so worried about Ebola. If you're in West Africa, yes, you should be afraid, but here? It's ridiculous. ""One person has died in the United States from Ebola and that's awful. But if you want to worry about a contagious disease that can kill you, worry about the flu. Did you know tens of thousands of people died from the flu last year, tens of thousands? I don't see people stampeding to CVS to get a flu shot."" She's right. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 1997 to 2007, flu deaths ranged from a low of about 3,500 to a high of 49,000 deaths a year. The flu reached epidemic levels in last year's season. And just like that I was cured of Fear-bola with a dose of the facts. Unless you are a health care worker or family member caring for an infected patient, you are not going to contract Ebola in the United States. You have nothing to fear. We cannot allow Fear-bola to take over America because the world needs our help. We need to think rationally, and we need to think globally. In West Africa, the facts are grim -- more than 4,000 dead, and the outbreak is doubling in size every three weeks. The World Health Organization says West Africa could see 10,000 new Ebola cases a week by December. It's spreading quickly in West Africa because the affected countries are politically unstable and recovering from war, and they lack the public health infrastructure to quarantine people properly, provide health workers with protective gear and educate the population about risks and best practices. We're right to be concerned about the welfare of the medical professionals who were treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who died from Ebola in Dallas. But an outbreak is not likely. Our public health and communication infrastructures are yet another reason why there will never be a major Ebola outbreak here. The spread of Ebola overseas has more to do with the social and political realities in West Africa than the reality of the virus. It is vital to mobilize our health care experts and nongovernmental organizations overseas quickly. The best way to prevent Ebola in the United States is to protect people in West Africa. Here, two people are infected with Ebola in Dallas; in West Africa, more than 8,000 are infected. The fewer people who get it in West Africa, the less likely it will spread here. It's counterintuitive, but a travel ban driven by Fear-bola would actually spread Ebola, as this article in Forbes explains. A travel ban would also seal us off when invaluable resources from the CDC and the National Institutes of Health need to be deployed to help stop the spread of Ebola on a global scale. If a ship is sinking, what good does it do to lock ourselves below deck in our cabins? In 2002, we were invaluable in fighting SARS and in 2009, working with China to curb the swine flu outbreak. If you live in West Africa, you have reason to be afraid. If you care for Ebola patients, you must be extraordinary careful. If you have been placed in quarantine, you better remain there until you are cleared. For the rest of us here in the United States, it's time to eradicate Fear-bola and focus on how you can help those who are suffering from the Ebola outbreak overseas. And while you're at it, you should probably get a flu shot.","Poll finds two-thirds of Americans fear a widespread epidemic of Ebola in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- People of the Internet, make yourself comfortable on the couch. Google would like to psychoanalyze you. OK, not really. But an interactive doodle on Google's search page Friday invited users to take a Rorschach test. Traditionally the test requires a person to look at a series of abstract inkblots and describe what they see. Some mental-health experts believe the answers can reveal personality characteristics and disorders. The doodle celebrates the 129th birthday of Hermann Rorschach, the Swiss psychoanalyst who developed the famous test. Google's page allowed users to click through a series of inkblot images and share their interpretations of them on social media. Some ink blotches were abstract, while others clearly depicted things such as cats (this is the Internet, after all). By mid-morning Friday, feeds on Facebook, Twitter and Google+ were filling with Rorschach answers, or jokes (Rorschach, the spotted-faced character in the Watchmen graphic novel and movie, was a popular one).

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Just seven days after the world woke up to the shock of yet another South African police brutality scandal, the story has already moved to the inside pages of newspapers. Here in South Africa we are not much surprised by the brutal death of Mido Macia, the taxi driver who was allegedly dragged by a police van to his death last week. The only surprise is that South Africans -- and knowledgeable observers of the country -- were surprised by this outrage at all. Macia's tragic death is merely the latest in a long and growing list of innocents suspected of being perpetrated by our police. Macia's name is preceded by others that reflect the re-militarization of the SA Police Services over the past four years, and the consequences of that process. We remember very well, here, the name Atlegang Aphane. He was three years old when police shot him dead in 2009, allegedly because the policeman thought the toddler was carrying a gun. He was just playing with a piece of iron pipe in a settlement where toys are hard to come by. Then there was the activist and teacher Andries Tatane: he ran to stop policemen abusing an old man. Eleven of them beat him to death with batons in front of television cameras and shot him with rubber bullets at point-blank range. And so it goes on. Last August 34 striking mineworkers at Marikana were mowed down in under 30 minutes by police, who later bizarrely charged their surviving comrades with murder of their own colleagues. As if that was not enough, the commissioner of police later told her members that they should not feel sorry for what had happened. More than 13 of the Marikana dead were shot in the back. The reason for the increase in cases of police brutality in South Africa is not hard to find. It goes straight to the heart of the administration of President Jacob Zuma, which since its inauguration in May 2009 has beaten the drum of ""tough action"" against the admittedly high and rampant crime in our country. South Africa fury over shooting tests Zuma . In 1994 the Nelson Mandela administration actively started demilitarizing the apartheid police force. Military ranks were abandoned, and the word service was added to the police's name to make it the SA Police Services. Civilians were encouraged to be more active in police structures, with community policing becoming the norm. Not so under Zuma. A process of re-militarization of the police started, coupled with tough talk from politicians and police top brass. Zuma's administration was particularly enamored with the word ""bastard."" ""We cannot say to the police, retreat. We cannot say to South Africans, despair. Our job is to give people hope. Yes. Shoot the bastards. Hard-nut to crack, incorrigible bastards,"" said then-deputy police minister Fikile Mbalula in 2009. He was echoing words used by the justice minister, Susan Shabangu, who had said the year before: ""You must kill the bastards if they threaten you or the community. You must not worry about the regulations. That is my responsibility. Your responsibility is to serve and protect."" In the period since 2009 military nomenclature has returned to the SAPS. The police commissioner now carries the rank of general. Crack units have been established, and the para-military unit ""AmaBherete"" is notorious for its brutality in enforcing the law in townships. Victims have provided numerous footage of their brutality, in one case beating up restaurant patrons without any provocation, but no action has been taken. Police brutality is rarely punished in South Africa. City Press newspaper reports that in the 2011/12 financial year 720 deaths allegedly at the hands of police were investigated by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate. Only five officers were dismissed and 13 convicted of crimes during that period. In the 2008/09 financial year 912 deaths at the hands of police were investigated. Just three officers were dismissed. It is not just that the police do not want to act. As demonstrated by the sheer buffoonery of the investigation carried out by Hilton Botha -- the investigating officer in the Oscar Pistorius case and himself facing seven charges of murder for shooting at a taxi with seven passengers in it -- our police services are terrible at investigation. Out of 65,000 sexual offences reported every year in South Africa in recent times, the police are fortunate to record more than 4,000 convictions. It is almost just not worth reporting the crime. So where does that leave us, a country still reeling from international coverage of Pistorius' shooting of an innocent woman in his own bathroom? Where does all this rape, murder and brutality come from? Many point to apartheid, others to the gun and violent culture of that system. Others point to its effects: the dehumanization of the black man and the dehumanization of the white man too. The sociologists are kept busy with all this -- how does one explain an international athlete living in a secure estate sleeping with a gun by his bedside and a rifle at his windowsill? How does one explain a rape every four minutes? The here and now is that we are not doing enough to push back against our historical problems. Men are not being taught in schools and communities that rape is wrong. Police are being re-militarized. All this points to one thing: You will be hearing of another violent, police or gun-related or rape-related, scandal out of South Africa before long. After all, Zuma has already promised tough action against protesters this year. Our police are ready, and waiting, to ""shoot to kill."" Editor's note: South Africa's acting police minister has said tough action will be taken against those involved in the death of Mido Macia and called for a speedy independent investigation. Moses Dlamini, a spokesman for the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), an independent government agency that looks into possible crimes by police, said officers who carry out crimes do not reflect the police service as a whole. ""There are many other officers who are dedicated, who uphold the law and arrest criminals all the time,"" he said. Dlamini also said the statistics cited by the City Press were misleading when viewed out of context. Not all of the 720 deaths reported in 2011/2012 were caused by police action, he said. Some were due to natural causes or injuries sustained before arrest. ""In fact, the number of deaths in custody as well as deaths as a result of police action have been declining significantly over the last four years."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Justice Malala.","Taxi driver Mido Macia allegedly dragged by a police van to his death last week .

"(CNN) -- You likely know that being overweight increases your risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. But did you know it also increases your risk for cancer? If you didn't, you're not alone. While around 90% of Americans know that smoking is linked to higher rates of cancer, Dr. Clifford Hudis says, the inverse is true for obesity and cancer; less than 10% of us realize how fat is related to this chronic disease. ""Obesity is a major, under-recognized contributor to the nation's cancer toll and is quickly overtaking tobacco as the leading preventable cause of cancer,"" Hudis and his colleagues at the American Society of Clinical Oncology write in a new position paper. In fact, as many as 84,000 cancer diagnoses each year are linked to obesity, according to the National Cancer Institute. Excess fat also affects how cancer treatments work and may increase a cancer patient's risk of death, either from cancer or from other related causes. The key word, Hudis says, is preventable. While we can't change the fact that we're all getting older (incidence rates for most cancers increase as patients age), we can change our weight through diet, exercise, sleep and stress management. The link . In 2003, the New England Journal of Medicine published the results of a study that included more than 900,000 American adults. Researchers followed the healthy study participants for 16 years, and found the heaviest participants were more likely to develop and die from cancer than participants who were at a healthy weight. After their analysis, the study authors concluded that excess fat ""could account for 14% of all deaths from cancer in men and 20% of those in women."" Since then, research has simply strengthened the link between obesity and cancer. Studies have found a relationship between weight and the risk of as many as 12 cancers, says Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, including endometrial, colorectal, esophageal, kidney and pancreatic cancers. A recent report published in the American Association for Cancer Research's journal predicted the top cancer killers in the United States by 2030 will be lung, pancreas and liver -- in part because of rising obesity rates. The science behind it . ""It's not enough to say there's an association between obesity and cancer. We need to know why,"" Hudis says. ""With the why, we can do something about it."" Scientists are exploring several hypotheses on how excess fat increases a person's risk for cancer. The answer may be slightly different for each type of cancer, but the encompassing explanation seems to be that obesity triggers changes in how the body operates, which can cause harmful cell growth and cell division. Many of these changes may be linked to inflammation. In general, inflammation occurs when your body is reacting to something out of the norm -- say a virus or a splinter in your foot. Obesity seems to cause chronic inflammation, which in turn may promote cancer development. Take for example, Hudis says, hormone-sensitive breast cancers. Chemicals in the body meant to regulate inflammation also increase production of the hormone estrogen. And studies have shown excess estrogen can cause breast cancer tumors. Fat tissue also produces hormones called adipokines, which can stimulate or inhibit cell growth, according to a fact sheet from the oncology society. If these hormones are out of balance, the body may not be able to properly fight cell damage. Let's talk about sex... and cancer . Treatment and mortality . Obesity can affect a cancer patient's outcome from diagnosis to remission, Hudis says. Obesity-related pain or unbalanced hormone levels may distract patients from the early warning signs of some cancers. Fatty tissue can also make it difficult for doctors to see tumors on imaging scans. And a late diagnosis often means a lower chance for survival. The relationship between cancer and obesity also matters after diagnosis. Cancer treatments, such as radiation or chemotherapy, may be hindered by a patient's size. If the patient needs surgery, studies show excess fat puts them at a higher risk of complications, infections and death. Tumor Paint: Changing the way surgeons fight cancer . A recent study of 80,000 breast cancer patients found that pre-menopausal women with a BMI over 30 had a 21.5% chance of dying, compared to women with an average BMI who had a 16.6% chance of death. Remaining obese as a survivor can also increase your risk of developing what's called a secondary cancer, the authors of this new position paper say. What you can do to reduce your risk . In general, ""people should be aware that overweight and obesity, as common as they are in our population, have serious consequences,"" Hudis says. ""Cancer is really just another one."" Start reducing your risk now: Stay active. Eat nutritious foods that are low in calories. Get seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Manage your stress levels. All these behaviors will help you reach a healthy weight. 11 simple weight loss tips . If you or someone you know is a cancer survivor, talk to your oncologist. He or she should be aware of the link between cancer and obesity, Hudis says, and able to help you find resources in your community. The American Society of Clinical Oncology is recommending more research be done on weight loss in the cancer survivor population to determine the best intervention method -- and whether losing weight after a diagnosis improves patient outcomes. The results of these future studies could help persuade insurance providers to reimburse patients for weight management programs.","ASCO: Obesity may overtake tobacco as leading preventable cause of cancer .

"(CNN)  -- The future is ""girl."" Imagine girl is a cell that each of us -- boys and girls -- are born with. Imagine this girl cell is central to the evolution of our species and an assurance of the continuation of the human race. Now imagine that a few powerful people, invested in owning this world, understood that the oppression of this cell was key to retaining their power, so they reinterpreted this cell, undermining its value and making us believe that it is weak. They initiated a process to crush, eradicate, annihilate, humiliate, belittle, censor, reduce and kill off the girl cell. This was called patriarchy. Imagine girl is a chip in the huge microcosm of our collective consciousness, which is essential to the balance, wisdom and future of humanity. Imagine that girl is the part of each of us that feels compassion, empathy, passion, intensity, association, relationship, emotion, play, resistance, vulnerability, intuitive intelligence, vision. Imagine that compassion informs wisdom. That vulnerability is our greatest strength. That emotions have inherent logic and lead to radical saving action. Now remember that those in power essentially taught us and conditioned us to believe the opposite: . Compassion clouds your thinking. Vulnerability is weakness. Emotions are not to be trusted. Don't take things personally. To be a boy means not to be a girl. To be a man means not to be a girl. To be strong means not to be a girl. To be a woman means not to be a girl. To be a leader means not to be a girl. It must be very powerful to be a girl if everyone Is taught not to be one. Having traveled the planet for 12 years, visiting more than 60 countries and living in the rape mines of the world, I have been with girls. I have witnessed their realities. I have seen girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns, treated like garbage, beaten by their brothers and fathers and boyfriends and mothers, starving themselves to death to look the way they are supposed to look -- which is close to invisible. We are so accustomed to prohibiting girls from being the subjects of their own life that we have turned them into objects: commodities in the marketplace, bodies to be bought and sold and plundered and married off or raped in war. Buying a girl is cheaper than buying a cow in many places. I have been with boys as well, watched as they have been ridiculed, censored and abused for their tenderness, their doubts, their grief, their need for comfort and protection. I have seen how the tyranny of masculinity has forced boys and then men to cut off their hearts and cast them into a brutal, lonely state of disassociation and isolation. The state of girl, the condition of girl -- in the world and in us -- will determine if this species survives. I believe unleashing the intensity of girl, the outrage of girl, the passion of girl, is the only way to chip away the thick sludge of denial, oppression and indifference that has led to our insane acceptance of a world spinning us toward our end. What I have witnessed across this planet is the wild natural resiliency, fierceness, grace and nobility of girl. The girl cell is our greatest resource, a renewable, untapped energy field like the wind. It is there for us, if we activate it and allow it to resist, dare, challenge, feel and connect.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Amanda Bynes is ""making great strides towards recovery"" from mental illness, her parents said Monday. The actress has been moved from UCLA Medical Center, where she had been treated since late July, to a private treatment facility outside Los Angeles for ""specialized treatment,"" the statement from Rick and Lynn Bynes said. The transfer was recommended ""by the skilled health care professionals at UCLA,"" they said. Bynes, 27, was placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold two months ago after she was involved in a disturbance in a residential neighborhood in Thousand Oaks, California. Her mother was granted conservatorship over her daughter under a California mental health law. She has since dropped her petition for conservatorship in probate court ""in an effort not to duplicate conservator rights,"" the statement said. The actress, who got her start on Nickelodeon with programs ""All That"" and ""The Amanda Show,"" faces three misdemeanor charges relating to an incident involving a bong allegedly tossed from her Manhattan apartment in May. In addition, she also has a DUI case pending in Southern California, while a pair of separate hit-and-run charges against her were dismissed last year.

"Washington (CNN) -- The harshest critics labeled them ""virtual strip searches."" Airport passenger screening that produced particularly realistic full-body images using backscatter technology. Others also expressed health concerns about low doses of radiation from the X-rays underpinning those scans. Well, it's all over now as the Transportation Security Administration says it has met a June 1 deadline to remove all 250 backscatter machines from U.S. airports. Travelers will still go through other full-body scans that rely on a system that uses radio waves and produces less detailed body imaging. The millimeter wave machines raise fewer privacy and virtually no health concerns. ""I think from the privacy perspective, that (the elimination of backscatter machines) has to be considered a victory,"" said Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. The TSA maintained that the backscatter machines, manufactured by Rapiscan Systems, were safe and effective. The agency had developed protocols to assure that screeners who saw imagery of passengers never saw the passengers themselves. But Congress voted to require all body scanners to have privacy-protecting software, and the TSA announced in February it was phasing out backscatter systems because they could not meet the new standard. The last backscatter machines were removed about two weeks ago, a TSA spokesman said. All 250 units were removed at Rapiscan's expense, the agency said. Currently, there are more than 700 body scanners at about 165 airports, all with Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) software, which display items on a generic body outline. Rotenberg said he still has privacy concerns about millimeter wave machines, including what information is captured by the machine -- even if unseen by screeners -- and how long that information is retained. ""We'd like to see clearer rules about the collection of the images,"" Rotenberg said. ""Are they deleted? Are they saved? Is some analysis being done and can they be linked to passengers?"" Most countries do not use body scanners, he said, preferring to use a combination of metal detection and technology that can identify explosives. Backscatter machines could return one day if the company develops required software, the TSA has said.","Backscatter full-body scanners generated controversy .

"(CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot on Friday asked for more time to ""reflect"" on what plea he will make during his murder trial, shortly after his attorney indicating the 24-year-old Dutch man suddenly had changed his strategy in relation to the killing. Earlier in the day, his attorney said van der Sloot was expected to plead guilty to all charges, but when it came time to tell the court, he asked instead for more time. When asked for a plea by the magistrates, van der Sloot said he wanted to give a ""sincere confession"" -- a type of guilty plea that can qualify him for a reduced sentence -- but did not agree with all of the charges against him. When the judge asked for clarification, he said he needed more time to decide his plea. The trial is postponed until Wednesday, when van der Sloot is expected to finally give his plea. He is charged with ""qualified murder"" and simple robbery in the killing of 21-year-old Stephany Flores. On Friday, prosecutors went over all the evidence and witnesses they had and gave a summation of the case against van der Sloot. The Dutch national was considered the prime suspect in the case of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, who vanished in 2005 while on a graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba. She was last seen leaving a nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men. Van der Sloot was arrested twice but never charged in connection with Holloway's disappearance, which is still unsolved. He now stands accused of killing Flores in his Lima hotel room in May 2010. Police say he took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. Van der Sloot faces a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. Flores' family later tried -- unsuccessfully -- to convince three judges from the superior court of Lima to impose an even more serious slate of charges that could have included a life sentence. The victim's family, including her father, Ricardo Flores, had pushed for stiffer charges and said that van der Sloot hasn't looked ""remorseful"" in court appearances. ""He had an indifferent and prideful attitude. He looks as if he has everything under control. He looks better than when he appeared on TV after he was arrested,"" Ricardo Flores told CNN last year. Three judges are presiding over van der Sloot's trial, and there is no jury. Besides the Flores murder trial, van der Sloot also faces extradition to the United States. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother. He was given a total of $25,000, and authorities believe he used that money to travel to Peru and participate in a poker tournament, where he met Flores. Holloway's father told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" show on Friday night that he felt van der Sloot appeared intent on trying to ""cause ... issues and problems"" during his court appearance. The father said he that believed the Dutch national seemed to be trying to manipulate the Peruvian system, saying he felt he'd done the same in court appearances in Aruba surrounding his daughter's disappearance. ""He's done this many times before,"" Dave Holloway said. ""I think this was all planned out.""

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- A massive two-week food distribution effort aimed at reaching 2 million people began Sunday in Haiti's quake-ravaged capital. Slightly more than 376 metric tons of rice were distributed to 100,368 people at nine locations during the day, World Food Programme spokesman Marcus Prior said. The food distribution plan, coordinated by the United Nations World Food Programme, international aid agencies and the Haitian government, was to hand out food at 16 identified points across the city. But on Sunday, people at only nine of those places were able to collect, Prior said. More time was needed to prepare ration coupons at five sites, Prior said. The other two distribution points, located in the dense slum of Cite Soleil, were a no-go for security reasons. ""The area has been extremely volatile recently with a significant increase in gang violence, but we are hopeful we will be able to reach them soon,"" he said. Distribution was orderly elsewhere, Prior said. Only women were given tickets to collect a 55 pound (25 kilogram) bag of rice per family. Forty-two metric tons of rice will be distributed each day over the next two weeks. At Champs de Mars, the city's central plaza which has turned into a sprawling makeshift camp for the quake displaced, women formed a long line that snaked up to trucks carrying the rice. Full coverage . One by one they stepped up and walked away with a white bag on their heads. A smile blossomed on some faces. U.S. soldiers were out in force to guard against chaos. ""There was no way we could do this without them. There's no way we could push back people without the troops,"" said Jacques Montouroy, a logistical planner for Catholic Relief Services, one of eight aid agencies participating in the two-week food plan. Prior said the WFP will work with its aid partners to ensure that men in need of assistance are not excluded. Women are receiving the food vouchers because they tend to be responsible for the household food supply, Prior said. ""Our long experience in food distribution tells us that by delivering food into the hands of women, it is more likely to be redistributed equitably among the household -- including the men,"" he said. Montouroy said most men have someone -- a wife, a sister, a mother or girlfriend -- who will be able to feed them. He said it was safer to deliver the rice to the women. But things didn't sit well with some men. ""What about me? I didn't get anything. I need food,"" said Johnny Sanon Stevenson. ""Many people could not participate."" The missing, the found, the victims . With tight security, it was impossible for crowds to enter cordoned off areas where the food trucks were emptied. The WFP said the specified drop sites are a key step in establishing food security. At the central plaza, Master Sgt. Ranny Lewis helped a woman carry her bag of rice and then led women waiting in line in singing ""Glory, Glory Hallelujah."" Lewis, a native of the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda who serves in the 478 Civil Affairs Battalion, said gospel was the lifeblood of the region. Song was a way of overcoming frustration and calm fears. Lewis said it was a dream come true for him to be able to help the people of Haiti in their greatest hour of need. ""This is the ultimate civil affairs mission,"" Lewis said. ""This is where the rubber meets the road."" ""It was difficult to control my tears,"" he said. ""It brings me home, to my roots. I was one with the people."" WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran said the January 12 Haiti earthquake was the ""most complex challenge"" the agency has confronted. ""But this distribution system will not only allow us to reach more people, it will give us the qualitative step we need to facilitate the delivery of all kinds of humanitarian assistance in the weeks and months to come,"" Sheeran said in a statement. The food aid plan involves at least eight private humanitarian agencies: Samaritan's Purse, Catholic Relief Services, CARE, World Vision, ACTED, Save The Children, GOAL and ADRA. ""Together with our NGO [non-governmental organization] partners we are working with the local authorities, churches and other civil society organizations to ensure that all male-headed households and others with special needs are not excluded from these distributions,"" Prior said. Details of the plan were finalized at a meeting attended by WFP, the aid agencies and senior members of the Haitian government, said Ken Isaacs, vice president of programs for Samaritan's Purse. He said those attending the meeting were given coupons, which were being handed out to needy families in the districts drawn up around each distribution point. The two-week effort aims to reach 2 million people in Port-au-Prince but does not expand to those living in other quake-devastated cities like Leogane. Ongoing emergency aid distributions to outlying areas will continue, Prior said. ""Up until now the nature of this emergency has forced us to work in a 'quick and dirty' way simply to get food out,"" Sheeran said. ""This new system will allow us to provide food assistance to more people, more quickly through a robust network of fixed distribution sites.""

"Jining, China (CNN) -- Four months after he built a new, two-story brick house in his village in northern China's Shandong Province, Xiao Guoqiang was alarmed to find a huge crack on the living room wall. Having seen homes in neighboring villages sink, Xiao realized his long-held fears were coming true. ""I knew the day was coming, but I didn't expect it to happen so soon,"" said Xiao, who has been forced to move from the land -- on which four generations of his family have lived -- as a consequence. Xiao's hometown, Jining, is one of China's ""coal cities,"" whose mineral wealth helps light up the night skies of the world's most energy-hungry country. The land here is honeycombed with coal mines, which can form massive sinkholes that leave thousands of homes uninhabitable every year. Ten years ago, the area where Xiao lived was a vibrant farming community on the North China Plain. But sinkholes are devouring 20 million square meters (7.7 square miles) of land here a year, according to the Jining Land Resource Bureau, and have displaced an estimated 100,000 people, mostly farmers and their families, over the past decade. By 2090, the bureau predicts one third of the city -- an area as large as Los Angeles -- will fall into the earth, and an estimated 5 million people will have been forced out of the region by the problem. Those figures worry government-affiliated sinkhole researcher Gu Mei, who said tensions over migration may lead to social unrest. ""Schools in some districts are overwhelmed with migrant students, while in other districts, classrooms are half empty,"" she told CNN. Sinkholes: Common, costly and sometimes deadly . In this low-lying area, most sinkholes quickly fill with water. ""I am afraid the city is turning into the Venice of the East,"" former mayor Li Guangsheng told the Qilu Weekly, a local newspaper, earlier this year. When coal was discovered in the region in the 1960s, it proved a boon for the local economy. State-run miner YanKaung Group Ltd. grew from a local coal company to a multination-listed energy giant, employing about one of every two workers in town. Meng Lingjun, a coal company employee, remembers the city as an underdeveloped backwater thirty years ago. ""When I was young, the town did not have a single factory, shopping mall or train station,"" he said. ""Now we are one of the most affluent regions in North China."" But that prosperity has come at a price. Each day, Meng passes hundreds of sinkholes on his way to work. Like many urban residents, he believes it is too late for the city to withdraw from the lucrative coal business. ""We are nothing without the coal company,"" he said. ""All we can do is keep mining and fixing the sinkholes."" In recent years, local officials tried several creative solutions for the sinkhole crisis, transforming the gaping holes into water theme parks, fishing ponds and lakes. One has been turned into a wetland park, a major spot for bird watching in the northern part of the city; another is now a fish breeding pond powered by solar panels. But more than 50% of the subsided land remains abandoned, often polluted and emitting a pungent aroma. ""The fund from central government for fixing sinkholes can barely cover expenses,"" government official Han Xizhong told CNN. While China's Mine Subsidence Compensation Act gives clear guidance for how much a coal company should pay displaced residents for damages, it fails to take into account the problems that follow, Han said. ""The sinkhole issue is more complicated than removing a village and refilling the sinkholes,"" said another local official, who asked his name not be used because of the sensitive nature of the issue. ""Many deep sinkholes have been sinking for over 10 years. You don't know the right time to treat them. Also communities removed from the subsidence area still need government support after moving to a new place."" But government-affiliated researcher Gu Mei claims the government has done a poor job addressing the problem. ""Local government would not consider filling sinkholes,"" Gu said. ""Think about it. If you can easily turn a flooded subsidence into a water theme park, would you take pains to reclaim the land?"" Some farmers have attempted to fill the holes themselves -- only to find the cost is too high. It costs at least US$15 per square meter to drain a hole and put in new soil. But according to Xiao Guoqiang, villagers only get compensated to the tune of US$5 per square meter from the coal company. The Yankuang Group declined CNN requests for comment, citing the sensitivity of mining-induced farmland losses and migration issues. For Xiao, the move to his new home has hit the family's dinner table as they can no longer raise their own pigs or grow their own vegetables. ""The pork price is rising and we cannot afford it. Having fresh vegetables and meat had never been a problem before because we grew and bred what we wanted to eat,"" Xiao said. Another villager points out the lack of jobs in the new location. ""Our new home is 20 miles (32.1 kilometers) from the nearest town. It is hard for us find a decent job,"" said Kong Jian, who operates a street noodle stand. ""Young people flock to bigger cities, looking for factory jobs. Those who stayed are doing small businesses like operating noodle restaurants,"" Xiao said. ""But for the next generation, nobody will know how to farm."" The 50-year old gets emotional when talking about his old village. ""As I get older, my nostalgic feeling for the old village grows stronger. I try not to think about it -- about the fact that it is a lake and the village only lives in my memory.""","When cracks appeared in Xiao's house he feared the worse .

"(CNN) -- European Union leaders have hailed an agreement to use funds from both Europe and the International Monetary Fund to help financially-crippled Greece as important for the euro zone. So what's the problem in Greece? Years of unrestrained spending, cheap lending and failure to implement financial reforms left Greece badly exposed when the global economic downturn struck. This whisked away a curtain of partly fiddled statistics to reveal debt levels and deficits that exceeded limits set by the eurozone. How big are these debts? National debt, put at €300 billion ($413.6 billion), is bigger than the country's economy, with some estimates predicting it will reach 120 percent of gross domestic product in 2010. The country's deficit -- how much more it spends than it takes in -- is 12.7 percent. So what happens now? Greece's credit rating -- the assessment of its ability to repay its debts -- has been downgraded to the lowest in the eurozone, meaning it will likely be viewed as a financial black hole by foreign investors. This leaves the country struggling to pay its bills as interest rates on existing debts rise. The Greek government of Prime Minister George Papandreou, which inherited much of the financial burden when it took office late last year, has already scrapped most of its pre-election promises and must implement harsh and unpopular spending cuts. Will this hurt the rest of Europe? Greece is already in major breach of eurozone rules on deficit management and with the financial markets betting the country will default on its debts, this reflects badly on the credibility of the euro. There are also fears that financial doubts will infect other nations at the low end of Europe's economic scale, with Portugal and the Republic of Ireland coming under scrutiny. If Europe needs to resort to rescue packages involving bodies such as the International Monetary Fund, this would further damage the euro's reputation and could lead to a substantial fall against other key currencies. So what is Greece doing? As already mentioned, the government has started slashing away at spending and has implemented austerity measures aimed at reducing the deficit by more than €10 billion ($13.7 billion). It has hiked taxes on fuel, tobacco and alcohol, raised the retirement age by two years, imposed public sector pay cuts and applied tough new tax evasion regulations. Are people happy with this? Predictably, quite the opposite and there have been warnings of resistance from various sectors of society. Workers nationwide have staged strikes closing airports, government offices, courts and schools. This industrial action is expected to continue. How are Greece's European neighbors helping? Led by Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, all 16 countries which make up the euro zone have agreed a rescue plan for their ailing neighbor. The package, which would only be offered as a last resort, will involve co-ordinated bilateral loans from countries inside the common currency area, as well as funds and technical assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to a joint statement on the EU Web site, a ""majority"" of the euro zone States would contribute an amount based on their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population, ""in the event that Greece needed support after failing to access funds in the financial markets."" This means Germany will be the main contributor, followed by France. Although the announcement did not mention any specific figure, a senior European official quoted by Reuters said that the potential package may be worth around 20 billion euro (US$26.8 billion). However any European-backed loan package requires the unanimous approval of European Union members, meaning any euro zone country would have effective veto power.","Greece's national debt is now bigger than the country's economy .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former Nickelodeon star Amanda Bynes is now a former defendant thanks to a plea deal Monday that resolved a drunken driving charge. The actress must serve three years on probation, attend an alcohol education course and pay a fine after entering a no-contest plea to reckless driving, a court spokeswoman said. The DUI charge was dismissed in exchange for the plea. The DUI charge was filed in June 2012 after Bynes' BMW allegedly sideswiped a police cruiser in West Hollywood in April 2012. She picked up two hit-and-run cases in the next several months, along with a charge of driving with a suspended license. All of those charges were eventually dropped. The DUI case was delayed while a doctor reported to the court on Bynes' mental condition. It got back on the calendar in November when a judge found her to be mentally competent to stand trial. A New York criminal case relating to an incident involving a bong allegedly tossed from her Manhattan apartment window was dropped last month. The troubled 27-year-old actress spent four months in residential psychiatric care last year after a bizarre incident in a neighbor's driveway last July. A judge placed her under an involuntary psychiatric hold which was extended at her parents' request. Bynes was released from a Malibu treatment center in December and now lives in the custody of her parents. He parents issued a statement at the time saying that she would continue outpatient treatment several times a week. She was just 10 when she joined the cast of Nickelodeon ""All That"" in 1996.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal's hopes of successfully defending his U.S. Open title have been dealt a serious blow after the Spaniard revealed he has sustained a wrist injury during a practice session. The world No. 2 says he will be out of competitive action for ""at least two-three weeks,"" ruling him out of the upcoming ATP Tour 1000 events in Toronto and Cincinnati and possibly out of this season's final grand slam tournament which starts on August 25. Nadal won both Masters events last season before beating Novak Djokovic in the final at Flushing Meadows in New York. In a statement released by organizers of Toronto's Rogers Cup, Nadal expressed his dismay at missing out this year. ""I'm extremely disappointed that I am unable to defend my Rogers Cup title this year,"" said Nadal, who beat home favorite Milos Raonic in last year's final. ""I was looking forward to coming there and playing again in Toronto as I have always loved to play in Canada and had great results in the past at a very important event. ""Unfortunately I injured myself yesterday (Tuesday) during practice and after checking with my doctors I will have to stay out of competition for at least two-three weeks. I am sorry to the tournament and to all of the fans."" The 28-year-old last missed the U.S. Open in 2012 when a knee injury forced him out of action for seven months in total. Nadal has endured fluctuating fortunes on court this year winning four tournaments so far including the French Open in June. His four-set win over Novak Djokovic clinched a ninth title at Roland Garros, but this was tempered by disappointments at Melbourne Park and Wimbledon. At the Australian Open in January, Nadal injured his back in the warm up before the final and went onto to lose in four sets to Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka. Normal service was resumed in Paris before Nadal exited early for the third year running at SW19. After being dumped out in round's two and one in 2012 and 2013 respectively, Nadal made it to the last 16 before succumbing to Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios.

"(CNN) -- It's been building for months. And now, according to some, Russia has launched a ""full-scale invasion"" of Ukraine. U.S. officials say Russian troops were directly involved in the latest fighting, alongside pro-Russian rebels. ""Russia is responsible for the violence in eastern Ukraine. The violence is encouraged by Russia. The separatists are trained by Russia; they are armed by Russia; they are funded by Russia,"" President Barack Obama told reporters Thursday. Moscow, meanwhile, has said it would do everything possible to protect ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine, but denies direct involvement in the fighting. It says the United States must stop interfering. A Russian senator and the deputy head of the Committee on Defense and Security in Russia's upper house of Parliament, Evgeny Serebrennikov, dismissed reports of a Russian incursion as patently untrue. ""We've heard many statements from the government of Ukraine, which turned out to be a lie. What we can see now is just another lie,"" he told the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. As the stakes seem higher than ever in Ukraine, what does this latest development -- a significant one, most believe -- mean? CNN.com breaks down some basics: . How did we get here? Last December, then-President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych backed out of a trade agreement long in the works with the European Union and chose to take a $15 billion loan from Russia for his economically hurting nation. That move angered many Ukrainians who wanted their country to move more in line with the EU, and who also saw their president as a corrupt politician who'd done little to help the nation's limping economy, experts say. Protests broke out in the streets of Ukraine's capital, Kiev. Shortly afterwards Yanukovych lost power, and Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered military exercises in Russia, just across Ukraine's border. Before February was over, armed men had seized regional parliament and government buildings in Crimea, a peninsula in southern Ukraine Russian whose population is mostly ethnic Russian. In March, Russian troops annexed Crimea. At one point, a security camera at Ukrainian military base captured a bizarre sight -- a Russian armored personnel carrier busting through a base gate. Since then, fighting between Ukraine's military and pro-Russia rebels has continued to rage in eastern Ukraine. Why does Russia care so much what happens in Ukraine? There are strong cultural and historical ties between Ukraine and Russia. More than 100 years ago, Ukraine was part of imperial Russia. In March, Putin gave a speech at the Kremlin in which he said Russia planned to ""welcome back"" Crimea. ""Crimea has always been an inseparable part of Russia,"" he said. A New Yorker piece by journalist George Packer argues that Russia will ""risk almost anything"" to keep Crimea while the United States and Europe have minimal interests there and won't expend the risk to reverse the annexation. A former ambassador to Ukraine explained in June to Congress why the United States should care about the nation, ranging from the fact that it's been a solid international partner on nuclear issues and in the war in Iraq. Steven Pifer said that the ""illegal seizure of Crimea is the most blatant land-grab that Europe has seen since 1945."" If Europe and the United States don't adequately respond, ""the danger is that Mr. Putin may pursue other actions that would further threaten European security and stability,"" he said. What has the West done, what can it do? The West can always do something. But what is realistic and practical? Most experts believe that answers are diplomacy and sanctions. Charles Kupchan, a professor of international affairs at Georgetown University, says the United States and allies can keep trying to isolate Russia diplomatically -- prohibit Russian leaders from attending major summits or temporarily halt trade talks, for example. ""The dialogue should continue,"" Kupchan said, on a conference call initiated by the Council on Foreign Relations. ""We have to look at this crisis with a certain amount of sobriety, in the sense that we still need Russian cooperation, if we can get it, on a lot of issues."" Keeping communication open with Russia is important to help deal with situations that aren't directly related to Ukraine -- nuclear talks with Iran, the continuing crisis in Syria, energy supplies and prices in the region and the Afghanistan war. What's going on with sanctions the United States previously imposed on Russia? Back in March, interim Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said that he was afraid diplomatic pressure isn't enough. So far the United States and allies have relied largely on sanctions to punish and influence Russia. Sanctions have been imposed on major Russian banks making it hard for those institutions to provide new medium and long-term financing in the United States, senior administration officials have said. Obama imposes new sanctions on Russia over Ukraine . There have also been sanctions that sought to freeze any U.S. assets in Russia and prohibit American business contacts for eight Russian arms companies that make weapons. Some of those arms are the type being used by the pro-Russians separatists in Ukraine. Specific Russian government officials have also been the targets of sanctions. Russia sanctions: West's top 15 targets . But global economist Robert Kahn, of the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN Thursday that sanctions can cut both ways. When sanctions were stepped up after Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was downed in Ukraine -- a tragedy the West blamed on Russia-backed separatists (a charge Russia has denied), Putin attempted to retaliate by banning food and agricultural imports from countries such as the United States, Norway, Canada and Australia. The ban was enacted to help ensure ""the security of the Russian Federation."" Russia is Europe's largest importer in value of animals, meat, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, according to the European Union. That forced the EU to pay for temporary storage of butter, skim milk powder and some cheese to help farmers who would be take an economic hit. Kahn said sanctions can work but the ones currently imposed are engineered to produce long-term results. Sanctions aren't moving, he said, at the pace that matches Putin's actions. What about military options? President Obama has reiterated that Russia's military moves in Crimea violated international law. It's a line the administration has often said -- that no nation can send troops into another country without provocation. While the rhetoric has been hard, it definitely does not mean military might in the force of America's own troops will ever be on the table. Using military force to undo Russia's military control in Crimea is ""out of the question,"" Kupchan said. ""I don't think anybody believes that it is of significant enough interest"" to bring in NATO or U.S. forces. Even Ukraine's leadership has said military might is a mistake. In March, interim Prime Minister Yatsenyuk told CNN that military force ""is the way to nowhere."" Retired U.S. Army Col. Peter Mansoor, who served as Gen. David Petraeus' executive officer in Iraq from February 2007 to May 2008, told CNN on Thursday the United States can ""send a message to Russia that their conduct is unacceptable without sparking a war"" with Russia. What could happen next? Col. Mansoor said he was surprised by recent incursions in Ukraine. ""For a while this summer it seemed that Russia was backing off,"" he said. It's possible that Putin recognized gains Ukrainian government security forces made in August against the pro-Russian militias. A U.S. official told CNN on Thursday that intelligence suggests that up to 1,000 Russian troops have moved into southern Ukraine with heavy weapons and are fighting. Satellite imagery, both commercial and from NATO, purportedly support that. Kahn said he thinks what's happening now could go on for some time -- a stalemate. The United States could ramp up equipping Ukrainian armed forces to fight the pro-Russian separatists and the United States could also station troops in Baltic states and in Poland which borders Ukraine. The Poles would be receptive to that, he said, and doing that would ""reassure our allies that we could defend them."" There could be more sanctions, too. But any moves made must be strong, experts agreed. Putin must be made to understand ""his actions are not increasing Russia power,"" Mansoor said, ""but actually bringing U.S. power closer to Russia."" Because, right now, what's happening in Ukraine Thursday ""shows that Putin's desires in that region have not yet been satisfied,"" Mansoor said, ""and he's willing to risk further sanctions and further war.""","The United States and allies blame Russia for the violence .
Moscow denies direct involvement in the fighting .
Diplomacy and sanctions must play a role, experts say ."
"(CNN) -- A U.S. Marine reservist who has been held in a Mexican prison for more than six months on a weapons charge is ""highly despondent"" and his mental health has dramatically deteriorated in recent days, his mother said. Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi is currently in the El Hongo Penitentiary in Tecate, Mexico, where he was transferred after allegations of torture at the prison where he was first incarcerated. While his family says cell conditions have improved, Tahmooressi's communication with the outside world has been limited in the last week after the prison phone he was using to talk to friends and family broke, limiting his contact, his mother Jill Tahmooressi told CNN. Meanwhile, over the last six months his court case has dragged on and been unpredictable, with no certainty or timetable for his release. ""He is lacking confidence that this will end soon and expeditiously,"" his mother told CNN in an exclusive phone interview. ""All we have ever asked for is an expeditious due process since he is a current Marine under contract until 2016. And the merits of the case surely point to accidental entry."" Tahmooressi was arrested March 31 at a Tijuana, Mexico, checkpoint after Mexican customs agents found three firearms in his truck, including a .45-caliber pistol, a pump shotgun and an AR-15 rifle. Mexico's strict federal gun laws prohibit anyone illegally bringing weapons into the country. Since his arrest, Tahmooressi has maintained that he took a wrong turn on the California side of the border into Tijuana. His mother told CNN in May that Tahmooressi, who served in Afghanistan, had moved to the San Ysidro, California, area to get treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. ""He has unresolved, or untreated PTSD, and he cannot get the cognitive therapy behavior that veterans of America receive ... in a Mexico jail, where there is no such thing,"" his mother told CNN. ""He's highly discouraged there is no light at the end of the tunnel."" Opinion: Should Marine be in Mexican prison? Doubts about his story . The day of his arrest, Tahmooreesi spent the day in Mexico hanging out with other Marines. He also rented a hotel in Tijuana where he had spent the previous night, he told CNN in an interview this summer. That detail has led some to doubt his story, including some in the State Department, who believe instead that he intended to cross into Mexico the day of his arrest, a State Department source told CNN. Tahmooressi's mother called any doubt about her son's story ""highly concerning"" and said, ""There is not one piece of evidence brought forward by the prosecution that would substantiate an intentional entry."" When asked by CNN, a State Department official did not respond to the question of doubt, but did release a statement. ""We continue to provide extensive consular assistance to Mr. Tahmooressi, and will do so until his case is resolved,"" it said. ""Consular officers have visited Mr. Tahmooressi 20 times since his arrest on March 31. While we won't go into detail about our private diplomatic discussions on this case, U.S. officials, including the Secretary, have talked to Mexican officials at the highest levels regarding Mr. Tahmooressi's case."" The statement closed by saying, ""We would like to point out that the Mexican authorities have been extremely accommodating and willing to engage on this issue."" Fueling speculation of wrongdoing, Alejandro Gonzalez Guilbot, the director of the Tijuana checkpoint, told Mexican media in June that border agents gave Tahmooressi a chance to surrender his weapons and return to the United States without incident. ""Never, and I want to say this categorically, never did he say that he had made a mistake,"" Gonzalez was quoted as saying. ""He never said, 'I got lost.' He never said, 'I am a Marine.' "" Tahmooressi told CNN in a phone interview from jail this summer that Gonzalez's statement is ""a lie"" and added, ""That's not true at all. They never told me anything of that sort."" Tahmooressi said the Spanish translator provided to him at the border added to the confusion. ""After I had got off the phone with 911 and I felt like there was no one there to help me, I even told them, I said, 'You can take my guns, take my truck and take all my possessions. Just let me go back to America.' And they shook their head no in frustration."" Admittedly, Tahmooressi had traveled into Mexico several times before his arrest, but only on foot, according to his mother. Opinion: A mother's worst nightmare: My son is detained in Mexico . 911 tape backs story? In his latest evidentiary hearing, Tahmooressi's third official appearance before the judge, his defense submitted surveillance video that ""coincided with Andrew's truthful and forthcoming statement of accidental entry,"" defense attorney Fernando Benitez told CNN. The video, which has not been made public, is said to show Tahmooressi hesitate and ""appear lost"" in his car at the border before driving up to the port of entry, his attorney said. The night of the incident, Tahmooressi called 911 to request assistance because he had accidentally crossed into Mexico. An operator can be heard telling the Marine that there was nothing that the U.S. could do since he was already on Mexican soil. ""That 911 tape has not even yet made it to the hands of the judge,"" his mother told CNN. Part of what's complicated things for Tahmooressi is the drama surrounding his defense. The first two attorneys hired by the family were fired, one after trying to coach Tahmooressi into lying about prior visits to Mexico, his mother told CNN. There were also ""missed opportunities,"" something Benitez, his current defense attorney, said is one of the reasons the Marine is still in Mexican custody. ""For anybody being involved in a criminal case in Mexico ... those first 96 hours are crucial,"" Benitez told CNN in a July interview. ""A lot can be done, and releases can and are obtained regularly, but you have to aggressively address a defensive strategy."" Now, Benitez says, his client is at the mercy of the Mexican judicial system, and there is no timetable for his release. Marine says he'd walked into Mexico before his arrest on gun charges . Celebrity takes up cause . Over the last few months, there has been a groundswell of support for the jailed Marine from a wide range of people. Not all of them have the Tahmooressi family's backing. One rogue supporter has gone so far as to start an online petition for people to help her shut down ports of entry in the Southwest until Tahmooressi is released. TV talk show host and mental health advocate Montel Williams does have the Tahmooressis' support and is working closely with the family to secure the Marine's release. A retired U.S. Navy lieutenant commander, Williams has written letters to Mexico's president and others, calling for an end to the incarceration, citing concerns for Tahmooressi's declining mental health. ""Yes he broke the law, but he didn't have the capability mentally at the time,"" Williams told CNN. ""It's very easy for you to make one wrong turn. He knows he made a mistake."" As for those who don't believe Tahmooressi, Williams said, ""How about those who say that, you have a right to say it because he spent two tours in Afghanistan protecting your Constitution, which gives you the right to say anything you want."" Pushing back tears, he continues, ""All I'm saying is, Why don't we look at this a little differently. He's a sick young man, he's an American. He paid the price for us! He's this way because of us! Bring him home!"" Williams is among a list of people expected to testify at an October 1 hearing on Tahmooressi chaired by Congressman Ed Royce, head of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Just as support for Tahmooressi's release has grown, so has criticism of President Barack Obama for his inaction on the case. Congressman Matt Salmon of Arizona said he urged Vice President Joe Biden to ask Obama to request Tahmooressi's release during a June meeting with Mexico's president. The president never brought it up, Salmon said. On the Mexican side of the border, high level meetings regarding Tahmooressi are also taking place, according to a source in Mexico's attorney general's office. Within the last week, senior Mexican administration officials and others have met to discuss Tahmooressi's mental health and whether his condition could be cause for his release, the source told CNN. Ultimately, the decision of what to do with Tahmooressi is in the hands of the district judge hearing the evidence. If convicted, Tahmooressi is facing up to 21 years in prison. His next court hearing is September 29. Marine tells of abuse in Mexican prison, but says he's still hopeful . CNN's Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","Andrew Tahmooressi has spent six months in a Tecate, Mexico, prison on a gun charge .

"La Paz, Bolivia (CNN) -- Bolivian leader Evo Morales says he's worried that U.S. authorities will plant something on his presidential plane to link him with drug trafficking when he attends Wednesday's United Nations General Assembly meeting. ""Do you know what? I think they have to be preparing something,"" he told a convention of female farm workers over the weekend. ""So much that I'm afraid to go with our airplane to the United States. Surely when we arrive, they can plant something and detain the presidential plane."" Morales said he was still planning to attend the meeting, but feared a U.S. plot. ""They are preparing something to discredit us with drug trafficking,"" he said. The U.S. Embassy in La Paz declined to comment on Morales' assertions. But some opposition Bolivian lawmakers criticized the president's proclamation. ""The president has to understand that these types of messages are not good, because he who has not done anything wrong has nothing to be afraid of, and when the president shows these fears it makes the population worry and it harms his international image,"" Rep. Jaime Navarro said. But Morales' supporters said political opponents have long used such strategies to bring down his government. ""They have always tried to harass the president, since he was a lawmaker they wanted to connect him with drug trafficking and they never could prove anything, and he has always faced the accusations,"" Rep. Edwin Tupa said. ""And now that he's president, it isn't an accident that anyone, especially the U.S. government, would try to ruin his image."" Bolivia and the United States have had diminished relations since September 2008, when each country expelled the other's ambassador. Morales, a strong proponent of the cultivation of coca plants -- the source of cocaine -- expelled the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration a month later. He also delivered a strong verbal criticism of the U.S. government at the United Nations General Assembly that year.

"(CNN) -- Bolivian President Evo Morales said Saturday that he was suspending the work of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Bolivia and that the government will take control of its activities in the war on drugs. Bolivian President Evo Morales, seen last month, says his government will control its anti-drug activities. Morales made the remarks in a speech in a remote part of Bolivia, carried on national television and radio stations. The announcement comes more than a month after Morales kicked DEA agents out of the country's coca-producing Chapare region, saying the government could no longer protect them amid a growing revolt. At least 30 people died in the violence, and Morales accused Washington of fomenting the unrest. Bolivia and the United States each expelled the other's ambassadors in September as well, and Morales launched a verbal assault against the U.S. government at the United Nations General Assembly. For its part, the United States accused Bolivia of not doing enough to stop the flow of drugs out of the country. Last month, President Bush said he had proposed cutting off special trade deals with Bolivia ""until it fulfills its obligations."" As he left Bolivia after his expulsion, U.S. ambassador Philip Goldberg warned the Bolivian government that reducing ties with Washington was ""a grave mistake."" Morales' accusations that the United States had helped foment the violence in his country are ""false and baseless,"" Goldberg said in September, and Morales ""insulted us."" The DEA has not been officially notified of any suspension or expulsion, spokesman Garrison Courtney said Saturday. He would not say how many agents are in Bolivia for security reasons but said it was not a significant presence. ""If this is true, it is an unfortunate situation,"" Courtney said. ""We've been working with our counterparts for over 30 years and have a tremendous working relationship with our Bolivian counterparts."" The violence broke out in September as Morales, the nation's first Indian president, battled an autonomy movement in the natural gas-rich eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Pando, Beni and Tarija. The movement was triggered by Morales' pledge to redistribute wealth from the eastern departments to the country's poorer highlands. Some of Latin America's leaders have supported Morales. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, long a critic of Bush and the United States, expelled the U.S. ambassador from Caracas in solidarity with Bolivia and recalled his own ambassador from Washington. In late October, Bolivia's Congress approved an agreement between the government and opposition leaders to hold a referendum on a constitution that would grant more power to the nation's Indian majority, according to the Bolivian Information Agency, or ABI, the state news agency. To spur the negotiations, ABI reported, Morales agreed to seek only one more term as president. The agreement followed weeks of negotiations between the government and political opponents, including the governors of the eastern provinces. CNN en Espanol's Felipe Barral and CNN's Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.","Evo Morales says he has suspended DEA's work in Bolivia .

"(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius claims that when he heard noises in his home, he mistook girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp for an intruder and accidentally shot her with his 9 mm pistol. Plausible? The courts will decide. In the meantime, the killing has highlighted South Africa's history of gun violence and high crime. And it's shown the world that many South Africans live with a palpable, almost paranoid, fear of having their homes broken into. In 2012, more than 50% of South Africans told the country's police force that they're afraid. The number of home burglaries across the country of 50 million have more than doubled. They totaled 9,063 in a 12-month period spanning 2002/2003; seven years later, it was up 18,786. And in a similar period ending in 2012, reported break-ins dipped to 16,766, according to South Africa's crime reporting body, the Institute for Security Studies. The international group Gunpolicy.org reports that there are about 6 million licensed firearms in South Africa. ""The paranoia about being a victim of a house robbery is understandable,"" said the group's small arms researcher Lauren Tracey. ""Victims are relatively helpless against these attacks."" READ MORE: Who is ""Blade Runner"" Oscar Pistorius? It's common to see armed guards patrolling gated, middle-class neighborhoods. Hiring a private security firm is not the exception but the norm. Workaday people install panic buttons, closed-circuit televisions, man trap doors, boom gates and outdoor point-to-point infrared motion-sensing beams on their houses. Also unique to South Africa: When burglars break in, they likely aren't after a flat-screen television or jewelry, experts say. They want the homeowner's guns. That's in part because it's very hard to acquire a gun legally in South Africa, but it remains, many say, relatively easy to get a gun illegally. A history of violence . To understand South Africa's gun culture, it's crucial to go back nearly two decades. In 1994, apartheid ended. The official system of racial segregation, in place since 1948, took rights away from black Africans and gave virtually all power in every aspect of life to whites. For generations, violence born out of apartheid spawned a kind of arms race; blacks and whites fought against each other, and everyone else armed themselves, afraid to be caught in the cross fire. READ MORE: Reeva Steenkamp, from model to law graduate . Gun violence was at a record high as the country made its first effort to become what archbishop and peace crusader Desmond Tutu envisioned -- a rainbow nation. Other spiritual leaders around the country began campaigning to reduce violence. ""Before 1994, there was a low-key civil war in South Africa,"" said Claire Taylor, a spokesperson for Gun Free South Africa, a non-profit group that grew out of a movement to cut down on crime born from years of inequity during apartheid. ""Both sides -- white and blacks -- were armed soldiers in a way."" READ MORE: South Africa's legal system in the spotlight . The roots of gun culture in South Africa are not unlike those of the United States, she said. ""There is a history of colonization, of taking, of settling,"" she said. ""For black people, the AK-47 was a symbol of liberation, of fighting back. There is huge meaning attached. Gun are about fighting and superiority."" Unlike the United States, the right to own a gun is not written in the country's constitution. Police have confiscated and destroyed hundreds of thousands of unlicensed guns, but it's unclear how many illegal guns remain on the street. Researcher Tracey also believes that criminal violence is rooted in South Africa's historical traumas. There was rampant proliferation of firearms in the nation before the end of apartheid, and liberation movements stockpiled them. Many of those weapons, she said, were never recovered. Laying down the guns . As Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first black president, took office in 1994, there was a tremendous desire to put the guns down. ""There was a national feeling that we had lived under the gun for so many years during apartheid, and we had to do something to signal that beginning anew was possible,"" said Claire Taylor, the non-profit's spokesperson. Taylor was personally motivated to act. At the time, one of her closest friends was shot to death during a break-in. In 2000, South Africa passed the Firearms Control Act. Since then, violence by handguns, Taylor said, has dropped steadily, often by double digits. Among the law's rigors: Before it was enacted, 16 was the minimum age to own a gun; today it's 21. To apply for a gun, you have to take competency tests, akin to a driver's license test, which demonstrates that not only can you shoot straight, but that you also know the law and how to store your firearm safely. Next, law enforcement conducts a background check that runs an applicant's criminal history and also tries to assess whether the applicant has a propensity for violence, may be mentally ill or suffers from an addiction that might cloud their judgment. An applicant must give references whom the authorities will interview, including relatives and a spouse, if that's possible, Taylor said. Authorities go a step further, checking medical information and digging into any instances of domestic violence or employment issues. Once licensed, gun owners must reapply and requalify for their licenses every two to 10 years. South African law also helps ensure that only one gun per person is approved. If someone is a sport shooter or has a reason that for needing to own more than one gun, he must file a separate application and explain, Taylor said. The law isn't a fix-all . The law isn't perfect. As one South African correspondent put it, guns are still very much a part of the culture. Signs at South African airports and casinos point to where consumers should drop off their weapons. And gun ownership advocates say that is why people are still incredibly afraid of hearing someone creeping in their house at night. There are about 2,000 guns stolen from legal gun owners in South Africa every month, according to Gun Free South Africa. Between April 2005 and March 2011, more than 18,000 police firearms were reportedly stolen or lost. Guns have gone missing from police stations. There's also a severe backlog in gun license applications, some of which date back several years. A task force has been appointed to look into the problem, Taylor said. All of this has highlighted one fact for the country gun rights organization Gun Owners of South Africa. Executive Wouter de Waal told CNN that it is ""dead easy"" to get weapons illegally. And there's little reason for armed burglars to think they'll be caught and punished. The rate of arrest and prosecution in the country is 7%, said former detective Rudolph Zinn, who wrote a book about home invasions and now trains South African police. He believes there's one chief reason for that: Few South Africans trust law enforcement because in recent years, the police force has become politicized, with higher ranking officers who are politically appointed. ""In 1994 there was a push to have policing more community-focused, there was more legislation to focus on that,"" he said. ""There was a distrust related to our heritage,"" he says, referring to apartheid, ""and unfortunately, over the years, we've gone back to that. I saw it often when I was a detective. There are undoubtedly more home invasions, he said, than are officially counted. ""People don't even want to report a crime,"" he said, ""because they don't believe anything is going to come of it.""

"La Paz, Bolivia (CNN) -- Bolivia's constitutional court voted unanimously to allow President Evo Morales to run for a third term in office, a decision that the opposition decried as abusive. Bolivia's constitution limits presidential terms to two five-year periods, but Morales was elected under a previous constitution with different rules. Morales' current term may be his second, but it is his first under the new constitution and therefore he is allowed to run for re-election, the court ruled Monday night. It's a maneuver that has been used in the past by Latin American presidents on both the left and right to extend their time in office while adhering to the word of the constitution. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ushered in a new constitution and also successfully argued that his first term under the old one did not count against his re-election. In the 1990s, Peru's Alberto Fujimori stretched his time in office in the same manner. Morales' quest for a third term faced criticism from the opposition, which saw the move as a manipulation of the system. ""This court has proved that it is working outside of the constitution and the law,"" opposition leader Samuel Doria Medina of the National Unity party said. He accused the government of having stacked the judiciary in favor of Morales. When the new constitution was passed by referendum in 2009, the opposition was already accusing Morales of having the 2014 election on his mind. At the time, there were reports that the president had agreed not run again in 2014 in exchange for the constitution being passed. Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, won his first election with a campaign that promised a government focused on the needs of the country's poor. But as an ally of the late Hugo Chavez, he has been accused of using the system to concentrate power. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed and wrote the story from Atlanta. Journalist Gloria Carrasco reported from La Paz.","A Bolivian court clears the way for Evo Morales to run again for the presidency .

"This week it was reported that Steve Jobs, the CEO and cofounder of Apple, underwent a liver transplant two months ago. One detail concerning Jobs's transplant seemed odd: The surgery took place at a hospital in Tennessee, some 2,000 miles from Jobs' home in northern California. Why Tennessee? Steve Jobs (pictured in October 2008) has been on a health-related leave of absence since January 2009. The answer sheds light on the intricacies of the organ transplant system, as well as why it's sometimes easier for people with significant financial resources to get an organ transplant. (Jobs' estimated net worth: $5.7 billion.) Livers are a scarce resource. In any given year, only about one-third of the people on the national transplant waiting list receive one, and as of late June, more than 16,000 people were on the list. Yet it sometimes seems that celebrities in need end up at the front of the line when they need a transplant, and people often assume they get preferential treatment. (Rumors about special treatment circulated after baseball player Mickey Mantle's liver transplant in 1995, for example.) Health.com: The real gift of life: How medical donations help . The truth is more complicated. No one can actually buy an organ in the United States (legally, that is). But getting a liver transplant, it turns out, is a lot like getting into college. Once you're on the waiting list, your chances of getting off it depend largely on your personal circumstances -- how sick you are and whether you are a good donor match. But getting on the list in the first place -- or on more than one list, as the case may be -- requires resources and know-how that most people don't have. Can some people 'cut the line'? There are 127 centers in the U.S. that perform liver transplants. If you need an organ transplant, your doctor will refer you to one of these centers, where you will be evaluated, given a score based on the severity of illness, and placed on the center's waiting list, if you are indeed a candidate for transplant. The center's waiting list feeds into a national database managed by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), a nonprofit organization that contracts with the federal government to manage the nation's organ transplant system. UNOS works with 58 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) that coordinate organ distribution in their region of the country. When an organ becomes available, the OPO in that region searches the UNOS database for a local match using blood type (and other biological considerations), the patient's severity score, and the time spent on the waiting list. If a match can't be made within that region, the organization expands its search to neighboring regions. The problem -- or the advantage for some patients -- is that not all OPOs are created equal. Some regions contain nearly 15 times as many people as others, and their waiting list times vary widely. Patients in the smaller OPOs tend to be less sick and experience shorter wait times before getting an organ. In the Tennessee OPO where Jobs received his transplant, the median wait for a liver between 2002 and 2007 was just over four months. The national average was just over a year, and in some OPOs it was more than three years. Though there is always the possibility of preferential treatment once a patient is on a waiting list -- UNOS conducts periodic audits of transplant centers for exactly this reason -- it is unlikely that someone like Steve Jobs can ""cut the line"" of the transplant waiting list. Health.com: Three sisters find kidney donor for dad using craigslist . The reason that some people might be able to get transplants more quickly is that they're standing in more lines. Nothing prevents someone from being evaluated and listed at multiple transplant centers. As long as a patient has the wherewithal to fly around the country -- and be available at the drop of a hat if a liver becomes available (this is where the private jet comes in handy) -- a patient can, in theory, be evaluated by all the transplant centers in the country. ""The system works at two levels,"" explains Arthur Caplan, Ph.D., the chair of the department of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania. ""One, who gets in to a center. Two, who gets transplanted off a particular center's list when an organ becomes available. Most of the attention goes to stage two, but the biggest ethical challenges are really at stage one."" Jobs underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2004. (He reportedly had a type that grows more slowly -- and has a better prognosis -- than others.) He was said to have recovered, but last year he appeared in public looking thin and sick. He took a leave of absence in January and underwent a liver transplant a few months later. However, it's not clear how long he was on the transplant waiting list, or whether he was on the waiting list for a center other than the one in Tennessee. Insurance matters too . Since 2003, UNOS has required that transplant centers inform all candidates that they can be evaluated and listed at more than one center, and that they can also transfer their care from one center to another without losing the time they have accrued on the waiting list. However, not everyone can afford to fly around the country and be evaluated at more than one transplant center. In fact, many people can't afford a liver transplant, period. According to the most recent estimates, the cost of a liver transplant is $519,600 -- a price tag that excludes roughly one-third of Americans because they don't have sufficient insurance (or any insurance), Caplan estimates. According to data collected for UNOS, only about 5 percent of liver transplants are paid for out of pocket. Health.com: Where the money goes: A breast cancer donation guide . ""What your insurance covers is very different from everyone else's,"" says Anne Paschke, a spokesperson for UNOS. Some insurance companies won't cover evaluations at multiple transplant centers, Paschke explains, and in at least one case, an insurance company has restricted its coverage to a single transplant center that the company itself owned. Moreover, your insurance continues to be important during the evaluation process. The decision to accept a transplant candidate takes place before UNOS enters the picture, and the committees that determine whether a patient is added to the transplant center's waiting list have access to a patient's full medical and financial history. ""There's a huge triage involved in getting in,"" says Caplan. ""If you're a homeless alcoholic sleeping on the streets of L.A., and you're going toe-to-toe with Steve Jobs, you're going to lose."" For most people, the ability to pay is a precondition for acceptance at more than one transplant center. Wealthy people who are, in effect, financially ""pre-approved"" for a liver transplant, can shop around and identify the transplant centers that will give them the best chance of receiving a new organ. Reforming the system . Despite the apparent problems with the transplant system, past efforts at reform have generally failed. Health.com: Could painkillers be hurting your heart? In the late 1990s, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued new regulations that would have given priority to the sickest patients, regardless of region. This would have eliminated the geographic disparities that make approval at multiple transplant centers advantageous, but Congress blocked the regulations and instead asked the Institute of Medicine, an advisory organization that belongs to the National Academy of Sciences, to consider the issue. The IOM's proposal was less far-reaching, but it did recommend standardizing the size of the organ donor pool for the sickest patients. Congress failed to implement this measure as well, however. Some transplant centers advocated the shift away from the OPO system, but others vigorously lobbied Congress to oppose the new policy. The smaller transplant centers were concerned that in a national organ allocation system, they would receive fewer transplants and be driven out of business. The larger transplant centers, meanwhile, wanted to maintain the size and geographical reach of the OPOs in their areas. ""There was a huge split in the transplant community,"" says Paschke. ""It was very territorial at the time, and there was a lot of maneuvering going on. There were a lot of business interests on the part of the transplant centers."" UNOS itself has been split on the issue of multiple listing. The organization's board of directors has voted on whether to restrict multiple listing three times in the past 15 years; the first vote resulted in a tie, and in the others the proposal was rejected by a divided vote. The inequity revealed in the liver transplant process is symptomatic of the larger inequalities in the American health-care system, says Caplan, who also cochairs a United Nations task force on organ trafficking. In countries such as Canada or Switzerland that have national health-care systems, a patient's finances don't influence access to organs to the same extent, he says. ""Money doesn't play such a big role in entry into the system,"" he says. ""Steve Jobs' transplant is relevant to why we need some health reform.""

The British world No. 6 has popped the question to his long-standing girlfriend, his management confirmed. The good news for the 27-year-old Scot is that she said aye, do! Murray got himself into hot water in January with a spoof tweet in reply to a fan's question saying he and Sears planned to marry after Wimbledon.

His tweets need a sarcasm disclaimer,"" she responded. It may be game, set and match in Murray's love life but the 2013 Wimbledon champion has decided to split from coach Dani Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green. ""We sat down at the end of the season and decided that a change would be best for all of us,"" Murray said on this website. ""My off season training and Australian Open preparations have already begun and I am very excited for the new year."" There is still another woman in Murray's life, however. He will continue to work with French double grand slam winner Amelie Mauresmo, who he appointed as his new coach in June.

"ST. PAUL, Minnesota (CNN) -- John McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, dealt with two startling disclosures Monday. She announced that her 17-year-old unmarried daughter is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. And Palin has hired a lawyer as Alaska investigates the firing of her public safety commissioner. Bristol Palin, second from right, holds infant brother Trig at Friday's announcement of their mother's candidacy. Palin hired a lawyer three weeks ago to act on her behalf as state legislators investigate whether she may have abused her power in firing the state public safety commisioner for refusing to fire her ex-brother-in-law, a state trooper, CNN confirmed. A report of findings of a legislative inquiry that began several weeks ago is expected to be released just days before Election Day. Palin also revealed that her daughter Bristol is pregnant and will marry the baby's father. John McCain was aware of Bristol Palin's pregnancy before he chose her mother for his running mate, a top adviser to the Republican presidential candidate said. The adviser, Doug Holtz-Eakin, said Monday that Palin ""was completely vetted by the campaign"" before she was chosen. ""Sen. McCain knew this and felt in no way did it disqualify her from being vice president,"" said an aide who asked not to be named. ""Families have difficulties sometimes and lucky for her she has a supportive family."" The McCain aide emphasized that Bristol decided to keep the baby, a decision ""supported by her parents."" iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Palin . Senior McCain advisers said Palin told McCain about her daughter's pregnancy in one of their ""private conversations"" last week before he officially asked her to run with her. However, McCain aides said he already knew, having found out about it earlier in the vetting process. ""She was very upfront about it,"" one aide insisted. Asked how the unmarried teenager's pregnancy would be received by the American people, another senior McCain adviser, Steve Schmidt, replied, ""I don't know; I'm not a psychic."" Delegates to the Republican convention in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, said the disclosure of Bristol's pregnancy would not hurt the Republican ticket and may make Palin ""a real person like all the rest of us."" ""I have a 17-year-old daughter, and they start making choices without us,"" said Annette Ratliff, a delegate from Texas. ""I appreciate the choice she is making to have the baby, but it just makes her a real person. It happens every day in America."" ""I think, if anything, it shows the Republican Party is a real American party,"" said Rex Teter, another Texas delegate. ""Every family has to deal with children, and sometimes children make decisions that parents wish they would not have been made, and things happen. But I think children are a blessing from God."" Sen. Barack Obama said firmly that the news should not have any bearing on the campaign for president. ""Let me be as clear as possible,"" Obama said. ""I think people's families are off-limits, and people's children are especially off-limits. This shouldn't be part of our politics. It has no relevance to Gov. Palin's performance as governor or her potential performance as a vice president."" Bristol Palin, a senior in high school, is about five months along, according to the aide who asked not to be named. The aide said the Palins and the McCain campaign decided to reveal the information now because of Internet rumors that Sarah Palin's 4-month-old baby, who has Down syndrome, was actually Bristol's. ""In the course of correcting that, we needed to get the truth out,"" the McCain aide said. iReport.com: Share your thoughts . Sarah and her husband, Todd Palin, issued a statement saying they are ""proud of Bristol's decision to have her baby and even prouder to become grandparents."" ""Bristol and the young man she will marry are going to realize very quickly the difficulties of raising a child, which is why they will have the love and support of our entire family,"" they said in a statement issued by McCain's campaign. They also asked the media to respect their daughter's privacy, a request echoed by McCain adviser Schmidt. ""The one thing that all the candidates agree on is this: Leave the kids alone.

""Fortunately, Bristol is following her mother and father's example of choosing life in the midst of a difficult situation.

"(CNN) -- He's one of the leading movers and shakers in the tennis world -- and he has set his sights on world domination. Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) chairman Chris Kermode believes tennis has never been in better health, with spectator numbers booming and new players bursting through to challenge established crowd-pullers Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray. That fan interest was evident at London's O2 Arena this month as crowds of up to 17,000 packed the venue to watch the world's top eight do battle in the ATP World Tour Finals. After next year's edition, the event could be on the move as Kermode and his colleagues look to bring live tennis to more fans worldwide. ""We are one of the few sports that does have a truly global footprint -- it's played globally, the interest is global,"" the 49-year-old Kermode told CNN's Open Court. ""You look at our top stars now and they have almost transcended their sport and become global icons."" The challenge now for Kermode is to discover if there's any part of the world that hasn't fallen in love with tennis. ""We've got to look at our own business and try to extend the boundaries of where we can get into new markets, new territories, new audiences --we've just got to explore everything,"" added Kermode, who is approaching the end of his first year as ATP chairman. ""What we did in London with the ATP World Tour Finals was to try and attract an audience that maybe had never seen tennis before. ""To see it live is very different from seeing it on television, and being indoors highlights the drama and the dynamism of these top players. ""We wanted to put something on that was very different to Wimbledon in order to attract this new audience,"" said Kermode referring to the grass grand slam, which emphasizes a more traditional approach to the game. A former player who has been involved in tennis for the past three decades, Kermode believes interest in the game in Asia, both on and off the court, is surging, with the emergence of Kei Nishikori as Japan's first-ever top 10 male player a key factor. ""I think it's just the beginning in Asia,"" says the ATP chairman. ""The calibre of men's tennis is so strong -- the depth is just extraordinary -- that I think it would be successful in almost any region now, but when you have that domestic player it adds the wow factor. ""Kei Nishikori is very aware of that. He is a young kid, he is a lovely lad... but that level of expectation on his shoulders, it's a whole country looking at him, that's pretty tough."" Kermode's enthusiasm for growing tennis is based on a belief that he took over at an opportune moment -- ""I inherited the game in probably the best health it's ever been,"" he says -- and a fascination with what lies ahead. ""We've got this mixture of the old guard of players and the young guns coming up, so on the court our product is the most exciting it's ever been for years,"" he explains. ""We are doing an internal review of the business, but last year we had record crowds, and this year we are going to beat that record again."" It's not just crowds that are on the up. According to Kermode, television audiences for tennis are increasing, ""digital has gone through the roof,"" while the sport has grown commercially by 200% since 2009. The ATP chairman is particularly intrigued by the potential changing of the guard -- what happens when Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Murray are displaced from the top of the tree? But he doesn't see that as something to worry about, arguing the field is now so strong that other players will step in to provide box-office appeal. ""We talk about the young guns coming in, and there are so many of them, but the old guard aren't going down easily,"" says Kermode. ""Roger is there and that's after people had written him off a couple of years ago. ""Lots of people talk doom and gloom about how tennis is going to be finished [when the current big four finish their careers], but I heard that when I grew up in the John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg era. ""Everyone said it would never be the same again, but then along comes an Andre Agassi, along comes a Boris Becker. There is always someone."" And the secret of these players' appeal? ""Sport is a very simple business model -- it's about caring who wins over someone else, and that's all it is,"" Kermode explains. ""If you don't care, it's not that interesting. If you know a bit more about their lives, I think that helps as well -- you buy in to them as a person."" If his vision of the future for tennis is correct, people will soon be doing just that all over the world.","Chris Kermode is chairman of the Association of Tennis Professionals .

"(CNN) -- It is one of the painful ironies of our time that in the same season Martin Luther King Jr.'s memory is finally honored with a memorial in our nation's capital, the state where he began to lead the civil rights movement is once more the center of an ugly conflict over racial injustice. The passage of Alabama's anti-immigrant legislation, HB 56, invokes inhumanity reminiscent of the Jim Crow South. And the police state it has created is equally cruel. If the law stands, children will be denied admission to public schools if they can't prove their citizenship, and schools will be turned into enforcement operations. Poor people of color will be ripped from their families if they are caught in public without their papers in order. Samaritans and people of conscience who employ, harbor or help undocumented workers will be severely punished. Already, opportunistic corrections firms are standing by to pocket money off prejudice and terrified families are selling off their meager possessions and fleeing the state. Our immigration system is broken, but our answer as a nation cannot be to terrorize and criminalize families. Our immigration policy must be consistent with our core values and our moral obligation to treat all people with dignity and respect. For all the differences that divide us, we are in this together. In these harsh economic times, we are more than ever wearing the ""single garment of destiny"" of which King wrote in his ""Letter From Birmingham Jail."" When communities suffer discrimination and degradation, we all suffer. When some citizens are denied fair treatment, we are all denied. When any group of workers can be underpaid and overworked, all workers are victimized. When families are threatened if they dare organize or speak out, America is threatened. ""Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application,"" King also wrote in ""Letter From Birmingham Jail,"" where he was imprisoned for nonviolent civil disobedience. Much about our nation's immigration practices echoes that observation. We call on President Barack Obama to oppose and terminate all programs -- including collaboration between state and local law enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security -- that result in racial profiling and target immigrant communities. Our focus should be on comprehensive immigration reform. And we must focus simultaneously on fixing our broken economy, an economy that is forcing 99% of the people to compete for a smaller and smaller piece of the receding American Dream. We also hope the good and righteous people of Alabama will rise up, oppose and repeal the abomination that is HB 56. Theirs is the state where our historic civil rights movement began, where King and his followers developed a model of nonviolent activism that changed not only Birmingham and Alabama and the South, but our entire nation. This week, a delegation of African American labor and civil rights leaders are visiting Alabama to support Latino families who face hostilities all too familiar to what King saw in 1963. Perhaps the ugly problems in Alabama can once again play a part in building a new understanding about the strains of division that weaken the fabric of society for all of us. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","Writers: MLK began fight for civil rights in Alabama; now state is denying rights again .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Eight current and former Bell, California, city officials arrested and charged Tuesday with misappropriation of funds and making or receiving illegal loans demonstrated ""corruption on steroids,"" the Los Angeles County district attorney said. The charges allege the officials misappropriated more than $5.5 million, including being paid for phantom meetings, District Attorney Steve Cooley said at a news conference. High salaries paid to officials of the city sparked local outrage and national attention when they came to light in July. Bell City Manager Robert Rizzo, Police Chief Randy Adams and Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia resigned after media reports that they were making several hundred thousand dollars a year each. Adams was not charged, Cooley said. ""The complaint alleges they used the tax dollars collected from the hard-working citizens of Bell as their own piggy bank, which they looted at will,"" Cooley said at the news conference. Arraignment is scheduled for Wednesday. In addition to Rizzo and Spaccia, those arrested were Mayor Oscar Hernandez, Vice Mayor Teresa Jacobo, council members George Mirabal and Luis Artiga; and former council members George Cole and Victor Bello. Bail ranged from $3.2 million for Rizzo to $130,000 for Cole. A battering ram was used to secure the arrest of Hernandez, Cooley said. Rizzo, who was being paid nearly $800,000 annually, is charged with 53 counts of misappropriation of public funds and conflict of interest. Among the allegations are that he wrote his own employment contracts and that they were never approved by the City Council, prosecutors said. Cooley alleges that Rizzo, hired as Bell's chief administrative officer in September 1994, gave nearly $1.9 million in unauthorized loans to himself, Spaccia, Artiga, Hernandez and dozens of others. Rizzo is responsible for $4.3 million of the city's losses, Cooley said. Rizzo's attorney, Jim Spertus, said Cooley ensured that reporters witnessed the arrest of his client and called it ""grossly unprofessional."" ""Candidate Cooley wants some good campaign material,"" Spertus said, making reference to the district attorney's candidacy for California attorney general. ""[Rizzo's] salary was openly transparent to the City Council, and the council approved it,"" he said, adding that his client will fight the charges. Spertus also said the city's loan program followed procedures and that Cooley's office did not interview many pertinent witnesses. Prosecutors charged Hernandez, Jacobo, Mirabal, Cole, Bello and Artiga with nearly two dozen counts of misappropriating approximately $1.2 million of public funds. Cooley alleges that they held ""bogus meetings"" that lasted only minutes at a time -- or not at all -- and collected payment. ""The [council] for their part provided no checks, no balances,"" Cooley said. ""The council members were busy enriching themselves for collecting money for meetings that never occurred."" California Attorney General Edmund G. Brown recently sued several of the former officials ""to recover the excess salaries"" that Bell officials were being paid. He also was pursuing a reduction of their pension benefits. ""This is a very serious matter when public officials breach their duty to the public and enrich themselves with enormous obscene salaries which then trigger pensions of similar magnitude,"" Brown said. The suit accuses officials of fraud, civil conspiracy, waste of public funds and breach of fiduciary duty. It also alleges they deliberately misled citizens about the accurate amount of their pay. Bell, in southeast Los Angeles County, had 36,624 residents as of the 2000 census. The median annual income is less than $35,000. Rizzo's last annual base salary was $787,638, Adams earned $457,000, and Spaccia received $336,000, according to Brown's office. Before recently cutting their pay, Bell city council members received $96,000 a year, compared with $4,800 a year earned by council members in similar-sized cities. Since 1993, the council raised Rizzo's salary 16 times, with an average jump of 14 percent yearly, the attorney general said. In 2005, he received an increase of 47 percent. Since 2001, city council members also awarded themselves 16 percent raises yearly. Brown, who is running for governor, said Rizzo prepared a memo for the public saying council members received $673 a month and he was paid $15,478 a month, which would amount to annual salaries of about $8,000 and $185,000 respectively. Brown said his suit is separate from a criminal probe, and he added that he plans to widen a statewide investigation of public salaries and benefits, and called for legislative reform. He said he was serving a subpoena on the city of Vernon, which is near Bell, ""to obtain compensation records for city officials and employees."" News articles have reported that one Vernon city official received an annual salary of $785,000, and another received a total of $1.6 million in compensation in a single year, according to Brown. Vernon has a population of less than 100 people. Also last week, acting California Gov. Abel Maldonado signed legislation to return ""illegal and excessive taxes"" to Bell residents. California State Controller John Chiang said last month that property owners in Bell paid and estimated $3 million in extra taxes over the past three years. Bell passed an ""illegal resolution in 2007 that resulted in a 50 percent increase in the tax rate over the course of three years,"" according to the governor's office. Chiang said Bell began raising property tax rates in 2007 to pay for pension obligations, even though state law caps those taxes at the rate used in fiscal year 1983-84. The lower rates would deliver, for example, an estimated $250 in annual savings on a property worth $275,000. Cooley said the citizens of Bell did not act as a watchdog. ""The electorates of these cities have to be involved if they really care about their city. That did not happen in this instance.""

"(CNN) -- Sprawling online bulletin board Reddit is especially popular with young men, according to a new study. Six percent of all adults on the Internet use Reddit, and it is most popular with men between 18 and 29 -- 15% of whom frequent the site. The survey was conducted by the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project, an ongoing effort to study the how Americans' use of the Internet is evolving and the impact it has on their lives. In a telephone survey of 2,252 adults, Pew found that men were twice as likely as women to use Reddit and that the site's popularly dropped significantly with the 50-and-older age group. Reddit: Gifts for men . On the social news site and meme factory, people share links, photos and original content in themed sections, called subreddits. The posts are then voted up or down by the community. The 5,360 active subreddits cover a wide range of topics, including politics, corgis, Starcraft, conspiracy theories and parenting. Reddit co-founder urges tech leaders to fight CISPA . Recent news events have pushed the site into the spotlight. Redditors helped uncover pieces of Aurora, Colorado, shooter James Holmes' online identity. Its boards are being used to organize protests against NSA privacy violations for the Fourth of July. And after the Boston Marathon bombings, members of the community attempted to do amateur investigating using public photos from the scene. Should criminal investigations be crowdsourced? Multiple people were wrongly identified as suspects by the community, prompting an apology from Reddit's general manager. One of the most popular and visible Reddit features is the Ask Me Anything (AMA) question-and-answer session. It has featured big-name actors, politicians, CEOs, an astronaut still in space, and even President Barack Obama. Launched in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, Reddit has grown into an influential site with a wide reach.

"(CNN) -- More than two weeks after four Americans -- including the U.S. ambassador to Libya -- were killed in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, FBI agents have not yet been granted access to investigate in the eastern Libyan city, and the crime scene has not been secured, sources said. ""They've gotten as far as Tripoli now, but they've never gotten to Benghazi,"" CNN National Security Analyst Fran Townsend said Wednesday, citing senior law enforcement officials. Exclusive: Senior al Qaeda figure 'living in Libyan capital' Last Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters that an FBI team had reached Libya earlier in the week. ""In fairness to the secretary, it may be that she wanted to be coy about where they were in Libya for security concerns. That's understandable. But the fact is, it's not clear they've been in Libya for very long,"" Townsend said on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360Â°."" Obama stresses diplomacy, humanity in speeches to U.N., Clinton foundation . ""They had difficulty, and we understand there was some bureaucratic infighting between the FBI and Justice Department on the one hand, and the State Department on the other, and so it took them longer than they would have liked to get into country. They've now gotten there. But they still are unable to get permission to go to Benghazi."" FBI agents have made a request through the U.S. State Department for the crime scene to be secured, Townsend said, but that has not happened. ""The senior law enforcement official I spoke to said, 'If we get there now, it's not clear that it will be of any use to us,'"" Townsend said. The FBI team has conducted interviews of State Department and U.S. government personnel who were in Libya at the time of the attack, Townsend said, but the FBI's request to directly question individuals who Libyan authorities have in custody was denied. Clinton praises Libya for its move to rein in militias . Libyan officials have said they have brought in dozens of people for questioning since the September 11 attack, which officials said occurred amid a large protest about a U.S.-made film that mocked the Muslim Prophet Mohammed. U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was one of four Americans slain in the assault, which has fueled increased global scrutiny of the North African nation and increased political sparring in the United States over the investigation into who was behind it. Speaking to reporters last Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the assault was a ""terrorist attack."" At the United Nations Wednesday, Clinton referenced the attack in remarks about violent extremism. ""Now, with a larger safe haven and increased freedom to maneuver, terrorists are seeking to extend their reach and their networks in multiple directions,"" she said. ""And they are working with other violent extremists to undermine the democratic transitions underway in North Africa, as we tragically saw in Benghazi."" On Wednesday, Townsend said a law enforcement source told her investigators from day one ""have known clearly that this was a terrorist attack."" U.S. post in Benghazi had less than standard security before attack . But officials have offered conflicting assessments of the attack, with initial accounts alleging that protesters angry about the film fueled the violence. That approach has drawn sharp criticism from Republican lawmakers. On Sunday, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee told CNN there was no proof indicating the attack was related to protests over an anti-Islam video. Republican lawmakers echoed that argument on ""AC 360"" Wednesday. ""I do not understand the continuance of the president to look the other way and not admit the fact that this was obviously a terrorist attack,"" said U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Georgia.

"Washington (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton backed President Barack Obama's historic easing of decades-old sanctions against Cuba on Wednesday and said she is ""deeply relieved"" by the release of U.S. contractor Alan Gross. Clinton, who was secretary of state when Gross was arrested in 2009, backed Obama in a statement Wednesday night that was in stark contrast with her Republican counterparts in the field of potential 2016 presidential contenders. ""I support President Obama's decision to change course on Cuba policy, while keeping the focus on our principal objective -- supporting the aspirations of the Cuban people for freedom,"" Clinton said in a statement. She called Gross's release ""great news,"" and noted that as secretary of state, she pushed for his release, stayed in contact with Gross's family and ""called for a new direction in Cuba."" ""Despite good intentions, our decades-long policy of isolation has only strengthened the Castro regime's grip on power,"" Clinton said. ""As I have said, the best way to bring change to Cuba is to expose its people to the values, information and material comforts of the outside world,"" she said. ""The goal of increased U.S. engagement in the days and years ahead should be to encourage real and lasting reforms for the Cuban people. And the other nations of the Americas should join us in this effort."" Her comments largely echo Obama's remarks. But Republicans, like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, called the move to ease the two countries' diplomatic strain a mistake, saying it would weaken the United States' negotiating position in pushing for democracy in the communist nation.","Hillary Clinton endorsed President Barack Obama's announcement to normalize relations with Cuba .

"(CNN) -- Forget Christmas. December is all about defense for Manchester City. The reigning English Premier League champions maintained their eight-match unbeaten run in all competitions with a 3-0 victory over Crystal Palace, Saturday. City drew level on points with table toppers Chelsea, who will be eager to put daylight between themselves and the defending champions against Stoke City, Monday. ""December is a key month to be in the fight for the title,"" City manager Manuel Pellegrini told reporters after his side's home win. ""If you want to be involved you must be very near the top of the table. I hope we continue playing like this. It was a very good win, a very good performance."" Crystal Palace had frustrated City during the first half, coming close to scoring themselves, before mercurial forward David Silva sparked into life after the break. The Spaniard broke the deadlock for City -- who are missing key strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko --when his shot deflected off Scott Dan and past Palace keeper Julian Peroni. Silva swept in a second soon afterwards before Yaya Toure drilled in at the near post to make sure of the victory for Man City. Their north of England neighbors and rivals, Manchester United, had to settle for a point from their away trip to Aston Villa. United had been on a six-match winning streak and would have expected more from their trip to Villa Park where they had not lost in 18 matches. Villa's talismanic striker Christian Benteke hit a curler into the corner to give the home side the lead after 18 minutes and deny United a magnificent seventh win. On-loan Colombian striker Radamel Falcao -- who played his first full 90 minutes after being given a place in the starting XI -- scored the equalizer in the second half when he headed in from close range. Villa were reduced to 10 men when Gabriel Agbonlahor was sent off with 25 minutes still to play but the advantage did little for United. ""I'm very frustrated,"" summed up Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal, whose side are third in the table and seven points off the leaders. Barcelona said Christmas had come early as Luis Suarez scored his first goal for the Spanish La Liga giants, Saturday. The Uruguayan ace, who joined Barca from Liverpool in a tasty $127m deal, had to wait until October to make his debut following his four-month biting ban. Suarez finally got off the mark for his new employers in a 5-0 thrashing of Cordoba, slotting in from close range to end his seven-game goal drought. Pedro Rodriguez opened the scoring at the Nou Camp, Gerard Pique headed in a third before Lionel Messi polished off the five-star performance with a brace. The victory saw Barcelona draw to within one point of league leaders Real Madrid -- who are playing in the Club World Cup final this weekend -- before the winter break. There was a nightmare before Christmas for Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga. The German side slid to their 10th league defeat of the season, losing 2-1 to fellow strugglers Werder Bremen, and dropped to second from bottom in the table. Jurgen Klopp's side, who face Juventus in the last 16 of the Champions League in February, will have to wait until the end of January to try to contain their dismal domestic run. Bayern Munich head into the extended winter break sitting pretty at the top after a 2-1 victory against Mainz, Friday. Pep Guardiola's side broke another Bundesliga record for the fewest goals conceded in the first half of the season. Bayern have conceded a miserly four goals so far. In the French Ligue 1, champions Paris Saint-Germain succumbed to the pressure again as they played out a goalless draw with mid-table Montpellier. Marseille can consolidate their place at the top of the table if they beat Lille, Sunday. PSG had made an impressive unbeaten start to the season but are on a downward spiral after losing to Barcelona in the Champions League and then lowly Guingamp in the league. At least footballers playing in France can put their feet up over the festive period and enjoy a 12-day break from competition before the French Cup swings into action.","Manchester City draw level on points with Premier League leaders Chelsea after 3-0 win over Crystal Palace .

"(CNN) -- Terrorists in Benghazi, Libya, ""essentially walked right into the Benghazi compound unimpeded and set it ablaze,"" a special Senate report on the September 11 attack that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans says. The bipartisan report, ""Flashing Red: A Special Report on the Terrorist Attack at Benghazi,"" released Monday by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, cites ""extremely poor security in a threat environment that was 'flashing red.' "" The State Department comes in for the major portion of blame for failing to respond to, even ignoring, repeated requests from U.S. staff in Benghazi for more security resources, especially more personnel. Read more: Hillary Clinton hospitalized after doctors discover blood clot . The department, the report says, left it to Libyan security personnel to protect U.S. diplomats, even though those guards were unreliable and had ""conflicting loyalties,"" a problem that it says was ""deeply troubling, especially since this problem was recognized long before the attack."" Read the report (pdf) In her preface to the Senate report, Sen. Susan Collins, ranking member of the committee, says the committee also found fault with the intelligence community, the Defense Department, the Obama administration and Congress. ""While the Defense Department attempted to mobilize its resources quickly, it had neither the personnel nor other assets close enough to reach Benghazi in a timely fashion,"" Collins says. The report also underscores the need for the intelligence community to ""enhance its focus on violent Islamist extremist groups in the region to improve the likelihood of obtaining such intelligence."" Read more: Benghazi report threatens to tarnish Clinton's legacy . Lack of adequate funding for security also played a role, the committee found. ""We have seen finger pointing about the lack of resources for embassy security,"" Collins writes, ""but the budget is a shared responsibility. The inadequate security in Benghazi was a product of both budgets approved by Congress and of the desire of the Administration for a light footprint."" Critics say the administration gave conflicting and misleading statements on what sparked the attack, and the report agrees, concluding that the intelligence community recognized it as terrorism ""from the beginning."" ""Nonetheless, Administration officials were inconsistent in stating publicly that the deaths in Benghazi were the result of a terrorist attack,"" the report says. ""If the fact that Benghazi was indeed a terrorist attack had been made clear from the outset by the Administration, there would have been much less confusion about what happened in Benghazi that terrible night. The attack clearly was not a peaceful protest in response to a hateful anti-Muslim video that evolved into a violent incident. It was a terrorist attack by an opportunistic enemy.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. warplanes attacked a convoy near Mosul in Iraq this weekend in an attempt to kill ISIS leaders, said a spokesman for U.S. Central Command. Col. Patrick Ryder, in a statement Saturday, said he could not confirm that top ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was in the convoy. Ryder issued that information in response to news reports indicating the ISIS leader may have died or been injured. ""I can confirm that coalition aircraft did conduct a series of airstrikes yesterday evening in Iraq against what was assessed to be a gathering of ISIL leaders near Mosul, destroying a vehicle convoy consisting of 10 ISIL armed trucks,"" Ryder said, using another acronym for ISIS. Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, is crucial to ISIS. Besides having material resources, such as Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam, Mosul is the site of one of ISIS's greatest battlefield victories . In June, the Sunni Muslim extremist group overran the city, causing soldiers and police officers to drop their weapons and flee, according to numerous witnesses. ISIS announced plans to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state, in Mosul after the takeover. In another airstrike against an ISIS stronghold, at least 15 people were killed and 31 were wounded when planes hit the town of Al-Qaim, in Anbar province, on the border with Syria, a witness said Saturday. The town is 286 kilometers (178 miles) from Mosul. The strike hit a market near an ISIS checkpoint in the town, according to the resident who cannot be named for safety reasons. The resident, who went to a local hospital after the strike and saw the wounded, did not know whether there were any ISIS casualties from the strike. Al-Qaim became a stronghold for ISIS, the Sunni Muslim extremist group, after militants took control in June. U.S. officials in Washington declined comment Saturday when CNN asked whether coalition or U.S. forces carried out the airstrike. Car bombs in Baghdad . Elsewhere in Iraq, car bombs hit four areas of Baghdad, including a busy commercial street, killing at least 21 people, police officials said. No public claims of responsibility were immediately made. But the attacks come after years of sectarian violence in the country, including some recent Baghdad car bombings that were claimed by ISIS. One of Saturday's bombs struck the busy al Sinaa commercial street in central Baghdad, killing at least 10 people and injuring 27 others, Baghdad police officials said. The other bombs hit predominantly Shiite Muslim neighborhoods. One exploded near an outdoor market in eastern Baghdad's Sadr City, killing one and injuring seven others, police said. Two other bombs exploded outside a fuel station in southwestern Baghdad's al-Amil neighborhood, killing at least seven people and injuring 22 others, according to police. And a car bomb struck near a restaurant in eastern Baghdad's al-Ameen neighborhood, killing three people and injuring 15 others. 1,500 more troops to Iraq . On Saturday, Iraq welcomed the U.S.-led coalition decision to provide more support in training and arming the Iraqi armed forces to help fight ISIS, but added ""this step is a little late."" The comment comes a day after the Obama administration announced the deployment of 1,500 more soldiers to Iraq to train Iraqi and Kurdish forces to confront ISIS. Iraq has allocated four to five training centers and U.S.-led coalition members have started sending trainers, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's office said in a statement. Meanwhile, al-Abadi's office added that the arming of Iraq tribes is done exclusively through the Iraqi government, with the supervision of its armed forces.

"(CNN) -- The headline screaming from the front page of Wednesday's Toronto Sun said it all: ""Rob Ford: Global Stuporstar."" Above the text, Ford -- the mayor of Toronto -- beamed out at readers from the news conference where he had just admitted smoking crack cocaine. In a drunken stupor. ""Probably, approximately about a year ago."" Despite the controversy, Ford is clinging to office, confounding critics and delighting supporters who say he's done plenty of good for the city -- despite headlines around the world that have splashed a bit of mud on the image of the gleaming lakeside city that's arguably the cultural center of English-speaking Canada. ""He's human. We all make mistakes,"" one resident told Canadian broadcaster CBC Toronto. ""If he smokes and saves me money, I'll vote for him â€” even if he's a bum,"" said another. In fact, some polling data suggested Ford's approval ratings had actually climbed in the days before his stunning announcement Tuesday after months of denials -- as they had in September with the scandal in full swing. At that time, some 10,000 cheering supporters packed the Ford family's annual barbecue -- even with all the lurid accusations of drug use and purported links to street criminals, CBC reported. ""He's a remarkable individual and a lot of people have put their faith in him,"" City Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong told CNN's Piers Morgan on Tuesday. ""The question is when will the public feel that he's basically taking advantage of them and that he has abused that trust that they've given him."" Tuesday's admission followed months of sometimes heated denials prompted by reports this spring by the U.S. website Gawker and the Toronto Sun newspaper revealing the existence of a video that purportedly shows Ford smoking crack. The scandal widened amid a police investigation and the arrest of one of Ford's friends on drug charges. He denied the allegations -- until Tuesday -- when he emerged from his office and shocked reporters with his sudden admission. ""Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine. But no, do I? Am I an addict? No,"" he said. ""Have I tried it? Probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago."" He has not been charged with any wrongdoing. ""I actually was completely surprised,"" said Robyn Doolittle, city hall reporter for the Toronto Star. Reporters had expected him to resign, she said. Toronto mayor won't resign . The admission was the only the latest oddity in what Toronto Life magazine called ""the weirdest mayoralty ever."" Among other things, Ford has been called out for comments some have interpreted as racist, homophobic and misogynistic, and he has had several brushes with city ethics regulators, according to the Toronto Star. But he has also scored successes, including fiscal reforms that have endeared him to supporters, columnist Philip Preville wrote in Toronto Life magazine. ""While the entire city has been distracted by the giant blowhard on the screen, the man behind the curtain has accomplished some impressive wizardry,"" he said. For some, the drama surrounding Ford echoes that of Marion Barry, who was mayor of Washington when a police sting operation captured him smoking crack with an informant in 1990. After a spectacular fall from grace and six months in prison, Barry successfully ran for a seat on the Washington, D.C. City Council under the slogan, ""He may not be perfect, but he's perfect for D.C."" He then ran for mayor again in 1994 and served a four-year term before returning in 2002 to the City Council, where he remains. A common tie between the men: a penchant for controversial quotes and an unquestioned love of their communities. ""He loves the city and wants to represent the city as mayor,"" City Councillor Jaye Robinson said Wednesday, speaking of Ford. Can he? Doolitle says she thinks so. There's no impeachment law or recall process to force him from office, she says. But Robinson says that despite continued support among his base, it's time for Ford to step aside -- at least temporarily -- and deal with his personal issues. ""It doesn't really reflect well on the city and the residents, many of the residents, most of the residents are fed up and they would like to see him resign,"" she said Wednesday. Ford, however, seems to have other things on his mind, Doolittle said. ""As far as he's concerned, the election for 2014's started,"" she said.

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- The global ""war on terror"" can't be won if people are living in ""desperate"" conditions, Archbishop Desmond Tutu told CNN. Archbishop Desmond Tutu says ""war on terror"" will be thwarted by poverty, disease and ignorance. ""You can never win a war against terror as long as there are conditions in the world that make people desperate -- poverty, disease, ignorance, et cetera,"" the Nobel laureate said. Tutu is in Hong Kong, where he is due to give a lecture on conflict resolution, reconciliation and forgiveness. He said the disparity between the rich and poor in parts of the world causes instability and insecurity, but added that he was hopeful the relationship between the two was becoming clear. ""I think people are beginning to realize that you can't have pockets of prosperity in one part of the world and huge deserts of poverty and deprivation and think that you can have a stable and secure world,"" he said. The former head of South Africa's Anglican church is an advocate of reconciliation, and he often speaks out against violence and is a frequent critic of human rights abusers. Tutu also discussed with CNN the military junta in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Tutu described the rulers of that southeastern Asian county as ""a military dictatorship that is running dead scared of a woman."" He was referring to fellow Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, a leading dissident and pro-democracy activist there. Aung San Suu Kyi's politics have led to her being held in varying degrees of detention off and on since 1989. ""The fact of the matter is she has nothing except her moral authority,"" said Tutu, adding that he believed recent street protests against the junta could signal an end to military rule. Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his vocal opposition and leadership against South Africa's apartheid system -- a government-sanctioned policy of racial separation which ended in 1994.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Herndon, Virginia-based Triple Canopy has been awarded the security services contract in Baghdad, a State Department source told CNN Tuesday. Triple Canopy is taking over the expiring Iraq security contract of Blackwater/Xe, a source tells CNN. The order is effective Tuesday, the source said, but Triple Canopy's ""in-country performance"" won't begin until May 7. Triple Canopy will take over the expiring contract of Blackwater, which changed its name to Xe last month. The State Department decided in January not to renew Blackwater/Xe's contract when it expires in May. That followed a refusal by the Iraqi government to renew the firm's operating license because of a September 2007 shooting incident in which the Iraqi government says security guards -- then employed by Blackwater -- fired upon and killed 17 Iraqi civilians. As part of a contract to protect American diplomats and other employees around the world, the State Department hired Blackwater for a multiple-year assignment in Iraq, renewable once a year. Blackwater/Xe, one of three security firms working for the United States in the country, had one of the biggest security contracts in Iraq. Triple Canopy already has a State Department contract in Iraq. The new contract will increase its share of the security work there. DynCorp International also has a State Department contract for work in Iraq. Losing the contract is considered a huge blow to Blackwater/Xe. While the company is privately held, the Iraq contract has been estimated to make up one-third to one-half of its business. Blackwater/Xe has about two dozen aircraft in Iraq, as well as 1,000 personnel. Earlier this month, the company's founder, Eric Prince, resigned as head of the company. Five former Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty in January to charges of voluntary manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from their involvement in the September 16, 2007, incident in a Baghdad square. A sixth former security guard has pleaded guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter. Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents, but an Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation. The Iraqi government maintains 17 civilians were killed, although the indictment alleges 14 died. The company does not face any charges. But the Baghdad incident exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life. The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act. The act was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services ""in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas."" Last year, the State Department renewed Blackwater's contract over strong objections from the Iraqi government. Starting January 1, the Iraqi government has mandated that all contractors obtain Iraqi licenses to operate.","Triple Canopy awarded contract, State Department source tells CNN .

"Near San Cristobal, Cuba (CNN) -- Fifty years ago, 15-year-old Omar Lopez knew a secret that governments around the world would have killed to learn or safeguard: Soviet troops were building hidden military installations in Cuba. One of those installations was on the farm where his family raised chickens and pigs. In 1962, Fidel Castro's revolution was just beginning to reshape Cuba. Thousands of Cubans had fled the country, and the year before, Castro's troops had routed a U.S.-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs. Read more: Should the U.S. fight or befriend Cuba? But little of the drama of those times reached the remote Lopez farm in western Cuba, where palm trees vastly outnumber human residents. ""Our life was getting up every day to take the livestock out to pasture,"" Lopez remembers a half-century later. ""We watched them, worked, did our chores and went to sleep to do it again the next day."" That routine was interrupted when Lopez and his father, Manuel, returned to their farmhouse one day to find a uniformed Cuban comandante waiting for them on the porch. Read more: Raul Castro again says Cuba willing to talk with U.S. ""He said they needed the farm,"" Lopez recalled. ""It wasn't right, but this was a time of war and they needed for us to move and would give us a bigger farm and build us a new house."" Seventy-two hours later, Lopez said, a house had been built for them, no small feat in a country beset by shortages. Lopez, his brother and parents left their farm with all their animals and earthly possessions. ""As we drove out,"" he said, ""the troops started coming in."" Read more: Should the U.S. raise a fist or offer a hand to Cuba? ""The troops"" were thousands of Soviet soldiers and technicians who had been secreted into Cuba as part of a confidential agreement between Castro and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev to place nuclear missiles on the island and upend the dynamic of the Cold War. On his family's new farm two miles away, Lopez might not have ever known that a large military operation was under way where they once lived -- if not for the pigs. The Lopez family's pigs kept wandering back to the old farm. Omar was dispatched to bring them home. Sneaking past the Cuban guards, Lopez said, he encountered tall, blond visitors who had commandeered his wayward porkers. ""They ate our pigs,"" Lopez said. ""When you said, 'Hey, that's mine,' they said, 'No comprende.' "" Read more: Pope calls for greater freedoms in Cuba as he ends two-country tour . As Lopez left with the livestock he could rescue, the Russians asked the teenage Cuban farm boy to come back with rum for them. Despite the furious pace of activity on his old farm, Lopez didn't pay too much mind to the foreigners. Then the shiny planes -- flying fast and low -- appeared over the green hills. Read more: Dissident Cuban blogger arrested, colleagues say . ""I saw the planes twice. They flew over that mountain range, came down and then flew out,"" Lopez said. ""That's when you saw a lot of movement among the Cuban troops."" The planes Lopez saw were U.S. spy planes, and as they flew over San Cristobal on October 15, 1962, they were capturing the first photos of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. Those photos arrived on President John F. Kennedy's desk the next morning. More spy flights revealed Soviet installations across the island and nuclear missiles that could reach the U.S. Eastern Seaboard. Kennedy ordered Navy ships to quarantine Cuba to prevent more Soviet missiles' and troops' passage to the island. For millions of people across the globe, a nuclear war and nuclear holocaust seemed imminent. Read more: Dissident Cuban blogger arrested, colleagues say . The standoff that would play out over the next 13 days would be called the Cuban missile crisis in the United States, the Caribbean crisis in the USSR and the October crisis in Cuba. But even though he lived next to a missile site, Oscar Lopez wasn't aware at the time that a crisis by any name was taking place. ""Back then, we didn't have TV,"" Lopez said of simple life in Cuba's countryside. ""We didn't get the news, no one delivered the paper. You lived to work. Back then, you were considered rich if you had a radio. We had no idea what was going on."" Lopez said they never heard of the crisis while it unfolded or that a deal was reached between the Americans and Soviets to remove the missiles if the Americans promised not to invade Cuba. He does remember the loud noise of trucks hauling the Soviet equipment from their farm. After the mysterious visitors left, Lopez said he and his father returned to their old land. Trenches crisscrossed the fields. Concrete bunkers now stood where livestock had grazed. The new land they had been given was four times the size of the old -- and now damaged -- farm. Still, Lopez's father went to see the comandante to ask for his farm back. Opinion: The hypocrisy of America's Cuba policy . ""The comandante said, 'If I gave you a bigger farm, why do you want to go to a smaller one?' "" Lopez related. ""My dad responded, 'You gave me a bigger farm, but that's not my farm,"" Lopez said. ""My farm is the little one, and that's where I want go back to."" Lopez's family still works the land where Soviet troops once erected nuclear missile sites. When Lopez, 65, is not tending to the animals, he takes the occasional visitor out to see the traces of the Soviet occupation of his farm. The road the Russians used to transport the missiles washed away a long time ago and the quickest way to reach the missile sites is by mule and buggy. On the day he took CNN out to see the ruins of the missile sites, Lopez sported a Boston Red Sox baseball cap and apologized that he had to borrow his neighbor's smaller cart since his had a flat tire. Driving out, Lopez pointed out a fence he made from a metal bridge the Soviets left behind. He also showed how neighbors used curved concrete beams from a missile bunker to build a pig pen. A jarring 30-minute ride later, Lopez and visitors reached one of the missile launch sites. Read more: Jailed American in Cuba may be ill, lawyer says . In the nearby jungle, vines wrapped around fallen buildings that seemed to belong to a much older and forgotten civilization. A small, faded marble plaque marked the spot where Soviets once pointed nuclear missiles at the United States. Lopez said the marble plaque was a replacement for a bronze one that disappeared years ago. The loudest sound at the remote site was the wind rustling though the adjacent sugar cane fields. ""We were lucky there wasn't war,"" Lopez said. ""After the atomic bombs and the sicknesses that would have come, there wouldn't have been a single Cuban left and there wouldn't have been many of you left either because you are very close.""","A small family farm in Cuba hosted Soviet missiles in 1962 .

"(CNN) -- Martin Luther King Jr. used his American Express card instead of a passport to get past the Berlin Wall. Now, 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, this little known fact and thousands of previously classified documents have been released. After an executive order issued by President Barack Obama called for the processing of classified records that are 25 years old or more, the CIA, in conjunction with the National Archives' National Declassification Center, announced it had made public more than 11,000 pages of documents detailing life and death in the shadow of the wall between 1962 and 1986. To prevent East Germans from getting into West Berlin, the border between West and East Berlin was closed by the Soviets on August 12, 1961. Called the ""Anti-Fascist Protective Rampart"" by East Germans, 155 kilometers, or 96 miles, of wall encircled West Berlin, itself a West German island in the heart of East Germany. The central part of the wall that divided West Berlin and East Berlin was 43 km, or 27 miles long. Intelligence reports and maps included in the document release details on the construction of the wall. What began as guarded barbed wire strung along the border quickly became barbed wire with guard towers and two high concrete walls, one on the inside, one on the outside of a no man's land. This ""death strip"" was littered with anti-tank barriers, signal wires, beds of spikes, sand --to see footprints, and guard dogs, all under the constant surveillance of armed guards with orders to shoot on sight anyone trying to cross. ""Ich bin ein Berliner,"" said President John F. Kennedy when he visited the city on June 26, 1963. Many of the US government memos outline the technical aspects of a presidential trip to the city only 22 months after the Berlin Wall was erected. Dr. Hope Harrison, who helped with the project and spoke at a symposium at the National Archives on Tuesday highlighting the document release, said massive media coverage in the West highlighted every killing. ""Cross and flowers"" marked death sites. She compared that to the East German approach. Coverage of the killings of people trying to escape East Berlin was ""taboo,"" she said. But a border guard killed at the wall was ""turned into a hero of socialism defending the border, streets and schools were named after them."" Hundreds of West Berliners standing on the Western banks of a narrow canal witnessed 24-year-old Gunter Litfin's death when on August 24, 1961 he become the first person killed at the Wall by guards with machine guns who shot him as he swam in the water. The killing of Peter Fechter, 18, was filmed by Western media and broadcast live as he bled to death after being shot trying to cross the border zone near Checkpoint Charlie. That infamous checkpoint, also known as Checkpoint C, was the one Martin Luther King, Jr. managed to cross without a passport. Diplomatic cables reveal how on September 13, 1964, after speaking to large crowds in West Berlin, he used his American Express card to get past guards in order to enter East Berlin. He conducted a church service there honoring President John F. Kennedy, who had visited Berlin two years earlier.

"(CNN) -- The White House has announced that on Wednesday, at the invitation of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Obama will speak in Berlin at the city's landmark Brandenburg Gate. The president's subject will be the transatlantic alliance and the enduring bonds between the United States and Germany. Berlin comes as a welcome relief for Obama. It gives him a chance to put aside for the moment the difficulties he is having in the Middle East and with the National Security Agency spying scandal. The president's Berlin appearance also reminds us that he is following in historic footsteps. June 26 marks the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's famous ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" speech, praising the citizens of West Berlin for their refusal to be intimidated by the massive East German-built wall that since 1961 had divided their city. The reaction of the crowd listening to Kennedy address them in front of West Berlin's City Hall was so overwhelming that, on the plane leaving Germany, he remarked to his aide, Ted Sorensen, who had written most of his speech, ""We'll never have another day like this one as long as we live."" Kennedy is always given style points for his Berlin speech because of its easy-to-remember rhetoric. But the speech is worth recalling today because it amounted to such a profound pivot away from the prevailing nuclear logic of the Cold War. In Berlin, Kennedy recast how he believed the Cold War should be waged in the future in a way that made his thinking clear to the European and American public. For Kennedy, the chance to speak near the Berlin Wall two years after it was built was a major opportunity to redefine his foreign policy leadership. In his 1961 Vienna summit meeting with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, Kennedy had gotten off to a rocky start. In 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis, he had regained his footing. He had resisted calls by some of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for a massive airstrike against Cuba and made sure he and the Soviets avoided backing each other into a nuclear exchange. In Berlin, Kennedy showed that he had learned from both confrontations. Instead of treating the Cold War as simply a battle over which side had the most military power and the will to use it, he framed it as a battle that also included the fate of captive peoples and their right to self-determination. It was an emphasis that would bear fruit in the Prague spring of 1968, in Poland's Solidarity movement and finally in Ronald Reagan's 1987 Brandenburg Gate speech with its memorable line, ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"" Kennedy's rhetoric in Berlin was equal to his good intentions. ""Two thousand years ago, the proudest boast was 'civis Romanus sum' (""I am a Roman citizen""). Today, in the world of freedom the proudest boast is 'Ich bin ein Berliner,' "" Kennedy declared. His words paid tribute to those Germans trapped in a divided Berlin, but his overriding point was, ""Freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free."" Kennedy was doing the opposite of saber-rattling. He was updating the ideas behind the Declaration of Independence so they spoke directly to contemporary Europe. When his audience heard Kennedy's words, they were reminded of the Berlin Airlift of 1948, in which America responded to the Soviet ground blockade of West Berlin with an airlift that brought West Berliners the food and supplies they needed without U.S. troops firing a shot. Earlier in June 1963, Kennedy had established the groundwork for his Berlin speech with an address he gave at American University in Washington. There, he spoke about establishing the conditions for an ""attainable peace"" that was neither a Pax Americana nor a peace of the grave. The Soviet Union, Kennedy cautioned, needed to abandon its distorted view of an America ready to unleash a preventative nuclear war, but at the same time America needed to make sure that it did not fall into the same trap as the Soviets by seeing Russia through a distorted ideological lens. Ever the practical politician, Kennedy conceded that he had no ""magic formula"" for bringing about such a change in the world's two superpowers, but it was possible, he concluded, to debate the Cold War without each side making new threats. ""We can seek a relaxation of tensions without relaxing our guard,"" he insisted. Today, the American University speech is widely praised, but at the time, the speech was seen primarily as a policy statement. The public reaction to the speech was minimal. One day later, the American University proposals were replaced as a front-page story by the highly charged racial confrontation between the Kennedy administration and Alabama Gov. George Wallace over the admission of two African-American students to the formerly all-white University of Alabama. Berlin was a different story in terms of its popular impact and a sign that Kennedy was becoming increasingly sophisticated in using his personal popularity to promote policy change. In Berlin, the still-young president took advantage of being on the global stage to make it easier for friend and foe alike to see him as a leader eager to steer America and the world away from nuclear confrontation. His efforts were not wasted. Two months after his Berlin speech, the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union signed the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the first such agreement since atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","President Obama is to give a speech in Berlin on transatlantic alliance .
It comes on the eve of anniversary of JFK's famous Berlin speech .

"Bloomington, Indiana (CNN) -- As Zoroastrian funerary processions enter the graveyard overlooking the Tehran suburb of Ray, their sobriety is often shattered by the sound of explosions and gunfire. Frequently, the way forward is blocked by Islamic Revolutionary Guards conducting a combat exercise among the tombs. According to Zoroastrian custom, burial needs to take place within 24 hours, and the Revolutionary Guards will not halt their training activities there for the funerals. This is just another sign of religious freedom fading in the Islamic Republic. Much that is written about the Zoroastrians of Iran portrays them as a venerable and quaint religious community. But these followers of an ancient faith are not insulated from the tribulations of their country. Zoroastrianism is named after its founder, the prophet Zarathustra -- or Zoroaster, as he came to be known in the West -- who preached sometime between 1800 and 1000 B.C. Zoroaster spoke of humans siding with God (called Ahura Mazda, or the Wise Lord) against the devil (called Angra Mainyu, or the Angry Spirit) and fighting for all that is right. In time, those concepts became central to Judaism, Christianity and Islam. So did Zoroastrian beliefs that each soul faces judgment after death before entering heaven, limbo or hell, and that all of humanity will experience resurrection, final judgment and heaven on Earth. Ancient Persian kings like Cyrus and Darius followed their faith's basic tenet of doing good by freeing Israelites from the Babylonian Exile and supporting construction of the Second Temple at Jerusalem. Zoroastrianism's clergymen, or magi, are known around the world as the wise men in attendance at the nativity of Jesus. Until Arabs conquered Iran during the seventh century, Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians there could practice their own devotions unhindered. Thereafter, they became minorities who were persecuted and largely converted to Islam. When the Islamic revolution occurred in 1979, fundamentalist Shiites stormed the fire temple at Tehran. There, Zoroastrians worship in front of a blazing fire, as a symbol of God's grace, just like Christians face a cross and Muslims turn to a qibla pointing toward Mecca. The portrait of Zoroaster was tossed down, a photograph of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was put up in its place, and the congregation was warned not to remove the image of Iran's new leader. Only months later could the prophet's picture be mounted upon an adjacent wall. Their schools and classrooms began to be covered with images of Supreme Leaders Ayatollah Khomeini and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and with verses of the Quran that denounce non-Muslims. Those who do well academically nonetheless find no openings within state-controlled universities. When the bloody war with Iraq raged from 1980 to 1988, young Zoroastrians were involuntarily drafted for suicide missions in the Iranian army. Rejecting the Shiite mullahs' claim that military martyrdom would lead them to a heaven full of virgins was futile. Failing to offer their lives on the battlefield could result in execution for treason. Then in November 2005, Ayatollah Ahmed Jannati, chairman of the Council of Guardians of the Constitution, disparaged Zoroastrians and other religious minorities as ""sinful animals who roam the earth and engage in corruption."" When the Zoroastrians' solitary parliamentary representative protested, he was hauled before a revolutionary tribunal. There, mullahs threatened execution before sparing his life with a warning never to challenge their declarations again. A frightened community subsequently declined to re-elect him. Over the past two years, many Muslim Iranians have begun publicly rejecting the Shiite theocracy's intolerant ways by adopting symbols and festivals from Zoroastrianism. Those actions are denounced as causing ""harm and corruption"" by ayatollahs like Khamenei and Jannati. Sensing that popular sentiment among Iran's Muslim majority is shifting away from the mullahs, even President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has begun utilizing Zoroastrianism's past for his own political ends. In September 2010, he arranged for the Cyrus Cylinder, a sixth-century B.C. document that speaks of religious tolerance and Iranian greatness, to be loaned from the British Museum. During a public ceremony in Tehran, Ahmadinejad lauded indigenous traditions as superior to Arab-imposed Islam. Privately, his chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, even referred to King Cyrus as ""a messenger of God."" Their tottering political base has sharpened the Shiite clerics' ire. Like members of the Christian, Jewish and Baha'i minorities, Zoroastrian activists who protest the theocracy's excesses are sent to Tehran's notorious Evin prison on charges of sedition. At the ayatollahs' instigation, Iranian media characterizes the followers of Iran's ancient faith as polytheists and devil worshipers. Lesser mullahs rant against Zoroastrians not only in Iran, but even at mosques in Toronto. The Zoroastrian cemetery outside Tehran now faces another challenge: The municipality seeks to lay a highway through it. Some schools and devotional centers in other Zoroastrian strongholds like Yazd and Kerman have also been notified of pending annexation. Communal gatherings are routinely monitored by fundamentalist Muslim authorities who allege that Zoroastrianism ""threatens national security and subverts the Islamic revolution."" Protections offered by the Islamic Republic's constitution have been rendered meaningless in practice. Not surprisingly, the daily regimen of discrimination makes Zoroastrians feel wholly unwelcome in their Iranian homeland. Only between 35,000 and 90,000 now remain in a country of approximately 74 million citizens -- and, fearing persecution, many do not readily identify themselves as Zoroastrians. Yet, Zoroastrians are no mere footnote in human history and religiosity. Their ideas still determine how many of the globe's residents behave. The end of Zoroastrianism in Iran should be prevented. Making religious freedom a priority in U.S. and EU foreign policies will help achieve that goal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jamsheed K. Choksy.","Zoroastrians are not insulated from Iran's tribulations, Jamsheed K. Choksy says .

"(CNN) -- Authorities arrested more than 100 members and associates of the street gang the Mexican Mafia in southern California as part of investigation into a wide range of offenses such as racketeering, kidnapping, attempted murder and drug trafficking, federal officials said. The arrests were made primarily in San Diego County and were the culmination of three major investigations on gang activity in the area, U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said Wednesday. In early morning raids, federal and local authorities rounded up 104 suspects. The charges are detailed in 17 indictments and eight criminal complaints filed by the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego. In all 119 suspected gang members were charged and authorities were trying to track down the remaining fugitives, Duffy said. The suspects are part of 20 major street gangs that were overseen by the Mexican Mafia, authorities said.

"(CNN) -- Who can ever forget the electrifying series of presidential debates in which Lyndon B. Johnson, outlining his Great Society program, went head-to-head in 1964 with Republican nominee Barry Goldwater, who boldly stood his ground on rock-solid, small-government ideals? Or the 1968 debates that America couldn't take its eyes off: Richard Nixon, trying once again to make it to the White House, toe to toe with Vice President Hubert Humphrey in what was shaping up to be a close election with starkly different platforms. The 1972 presidential debates, of course -- Nixon, who was by then the incumbent, trading verbal body slams with his Democratic challenger, George McGovern, against the backdrop of the Vietnam war -- were like a professional wrestling grudge match, with each excited camp of viewers at home pulling for its man to triumph. What? You say you don't remember those debates? You're right. They didn't happen. It's an intriguing footnote to modern political history. Televised presidential debates -- the first one of this year's general election will be held in Denver, Colorado on Wednesday -- have become so much a part of the fabric of autumn campaigns that many people assume that the famed John F. Kennedy-Richard Nixon debates of 1960 began an uninterrupted string. But in fact, after the four Kennedy-Nixon debates, it would be 16 years before there was another debate between a Republican and Democratic candidate. Brazile: Why debates don't always make a difference . Kennedy-Nixon, for a long stretch, was the anomaly -- the exception to the rule. Before their debates, no presidential candidates in a general election had debated on radio or television. There had been intraparty, primary-season debates but never one after the end of the summer conventions. It is part of political lore that, because of Nixon's pale, perspiring look in the first of those 1960 debates, he suffered in comparison with the tan, confident Kennedy, and the TV cameras did him in. Key to the shorthand narrative is that Nixon, not fully understanding the relatively new medium of television, declined to wear makeup. But there's more to the story than that. Largely forgotten is that Nixon had been hospitalized for two weeks in August, when he had hoped to be out campaigning. He had banged his knee getting out of a car at an event in North Carolina and had developed a serious infection. So, while Kennedy was introducing himself to voters around the country, Nixon was in a hospital bed -- and the newsreel footage of him, in his pajamas, being visited by President Dwight D. Eisenhower did not play well against film of the healthy-looking, vibrant Kennedy working election-season crowds. By the time Nixon left the hospital, he was in a weakened state. He had the flu and a fever when he arrived in Chicago for that first debate, and had lost considerable weight. He allowed his assistants to apply a drugstore-aisle product called Lazy-Shave to tone down his 5 o'clock shadow, but his ashen appearance, and the perspiration, were as much a consequence of his health problems as anything else. He lost, and in 1964, with Goldwater as the Republican candidate, President Johnson, who had taken office after the assassination of Kennedy, decided that there was no reason for him to debate. Johnson was well ahead in the polls; he was said to feel that a debate could not help him much but could certainly hurt him, if he did not do well. He sent word that he was not open to participating. Rosen: How Obama can win debate . There was another factor arguing against presidential debates in the 16 years after Kennedy-Nixon: the Federal Communications Commission's equal-time provision, which mandated the inclusion of all candidates -- fringe ones as well as the nominees of the major parties. (It had been suspended for a year in 1960, when Kennedy and Nixon debated). So the major candidates could use that as an out, if they preferred not to debate. In 1968 Humphrey wanted to debate Nixon, but Nixon -- still stung by 1960 -- said no. And in 1972, when Nixon was the incumbent and far ahead in the polls, he barely deigned to say McGovern's name during the fall campaign, much less debate him. By 1976 a way around the equal-time rule was found: If debates were sponsored not by television networks but by outside groups setting their own criteria, they could be considered news events and thus not required to include minor-party candidates. That year, President Gerald Ford, having entered office after Nixon resigned, agreed to debate Jimmy Carter. He may have wished he hadn't. It was in one of the debates that Ford said, ""There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe,"" a misstep that changed the course of the election. Today debates between the candidates -- even when one of them is the incumbent -- are all but mandatory. A candidate would be seen as chicken for not agreeing to debate. (If you thought the Clint Eastwood empty chair at the Republican National Convention this summer caused conversation, just think what a candidate who agreed to debate would have to say about the empty chair of an opponent who declined). Even post-1976, some candidates tested the waters of skipping debates. In 1980, President Carter chose not to participate in the first one because independent candidate John Anderson was included. Carter's opponent, Ronald Reagan, did show up at that debate -- and even though Carter appeared at the one subsequent debate that fall, Reagan went on to win the election. Four years ago, Republican candidate John McCain said that he wanted to postpone the first debate in Oxford, Mississippi; he proposed that he and his opponent, fellow U.S. Senator Barack Obama, instead go to Washington to help with the financial crisis. Obama said he would be in Mississippi regardless of whether McCain was (""It's going to be part of the president's job to be able to deal with more than one thing at once""). McCain relented and came to the debate, but his initial hesitation seemed to throw his campaign off balance. It's unlikely that there will ever be another autumn in which the candidates do not debate, but you never know. It's a pretty safe bet, though, that come nightfall Wednesday in Colorado, Obama and Mitt Romney will be at their appointed places on the stage. It's how we do things now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: After Nixon vs. Kennedy in 1960, there were no presidential debates until 1976 .

"(CNN) -- Little of the Berlin Wall survives today in the German capital. The onetime barrier between East and West has been torn down, chipped away or auctioned off. Between 1961 and 1989, the formidable East German fortification stood 156.4 kilometers long, fully encircling what was then West Berlin. Nowadays, the longest surviving stretch, the East Side Gallery on Berlin's MÃ¼hlenstrasse, extends about 1.3 kilometers and can be seen in its entirety on foot within 20 minutes. After reunification of the two Germanys, 65 cranes, 175 trucks and 13 bulldozers were deployed to remove the barrier in the inner city by the end of 1990 and in the outer city by 1992, according to the ""Berlin Wall Story,"" a chronicle of the 204,100-ton monument written by Hans-Hermann Hertle. More than 40,000 segments were crushed to make materials largely for building roads, but some survived intact. They were auctioned as art objects, purchased or donated to museums and institutions around the world, such as the Imperial War Museum in London and Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. However, a few segments of the Berlin Wall have over time ended up in some unexpected locations. Main Street Station Casino, Brewery and Hotel, Las Vegas . Perhaps the most surprising Wall location on this list is a men's bathroom at a Las Vegas casino -- the Main Street Station Casino has been home to a portion of Berlin Wall for about 20 years. Three urinals are mounted onto the graffiti-bearing concrete slab, which stands approximately three meters wide and 1.8 meters tall. The wall itself is protected by glass. It's unclear who brought this segment to its dubious location. According to Boyd Gaming Corporation, which owns Main Street Station, the Wall was already in the bathroom when the company purchased the property in the 1990s from another casino that went bankrupt before opening. ""Berlin Wall is one of the more popular items for sightseers at Main Street Station,"" says Boyd spokesman David Strow. He adds that the casino had to renovate the bathroom a few years ago due to ""the unusual amount of traffic it gets."" Female visitors can ask a security guard to escort them into the bathroom when it's empty to take a look. At the Wall. Main Street Station Casino, 200 N. Main St., Las Vegas; +1 800 713 8933 . Perfil Group building, Buenos Aires . A row of Berlin Wall segments can be found in the Buenos Aires office lobby of the Argentinian news company Perfil Group. The Perfil Group bought a total of 20 Berlin Wall segments in 1991. The company's website says it bought the Wall for its significance as a symbol of freedom. As such, it is ""true to the spirit of a news company who exercises the right of freedom."" 253-271 Peru St., Edificio Perfil, Buenos Aires . Schengen, Luxembourg . The village of Schengen in southeast Luxembourg has fewer than 2,000 residents, but a segment of the Wall was put up to herald its place in European history. The Schengen Agreement (now consisting of 26 European countries) was signed here in 1985 to grant citizens of its member states free travel without border checks. Together with the opening of the European Museum, the Wall segment was erected to mark the 25th anniversary of the agreement. The 2.8-meter-high and 1.2-meter-wide remnant stands in front of the European Museum ""as a symbol of a border that does not exist anymore,"" according to Martina Kneip, manager of the European Centre and European Museum in Schengen. European Museum, Rue Robert Goebbels, Schengen; +352 26 66 58 10 . Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles . The longest stretch of Berlin Wall in the United States stands in front of the Variety Building on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. The 25-ton structure measures 3.7 meters in height and 11.6 meters in width and consists of 10 segments. Murals on four segments of the Wall are original works from the Berlin Wall-era, including a green bear painted by a street artist known as Bimer. Others are recent works created by artists such as RETNA from Los Angeles and Herakut from Germany. The Wende Museum in Los Angeles, a research and education institute that preserves Cold War artifacts and history, brought these segments to Wilshire Boulevard in 2009 with help from the German government and the City of Los Angeles as part of The Wall Project. The museum sponsored the project to ""commemorate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and continue the legacy of the Berlin Wall as a concrete canvas for art and political expression,"" according to the museum's founder and executive director Justinian Jampol. These segments were discovered near the former border area of Kreuzberg in Berlin, according to Jampol. Variety Building, 5900 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles . Parque Europa, Madrid . The 233,000-square-meter Parque Europa on the outskirts of Madrid displays 17 scaled-down replicas of iconic landmarks across Europe, including an original piece of the Berlin Wall. The relic is located in the west end of the park. The segment was given to the park by the town council of TorrejÃ³n de Ardoz, the region where Parque Europa is located. A large section of rock near the bottom of the segment is missing, revealing a grid of steel rods. Behind it stands a small model of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate. For centuries a symbol of the city, the gate was blocked off from West Berlin by the Wall. Parque Europa, Paseo de los Cipreses, TorrejÃ³n de Ardoz, Madrid . Hilton Anatole, Dallas . Two segments of the Berlin Wall are highlights of the 1,606-room Hilton Anatole in Dallas, which hosts a massive art collection of more than a thousand pieces throughout 27 floors. The Wall sections were painted by German artist Jurgen Grosse in 1990. Each is 3.6 meters tall and 1.2 meters wide. The Wall segments were given to the hotel by a German partner in 1990 and initially placed in the hotel's garden. In 2011, the pieces were moved into the hotel's Trinity Corridor. Hilton Anatole, 2201 N. Stemmons Freeway, Dallas; +1 214 748 1200 . Cheonggyecheon stream, Seoul . Since 2005, three remnants of the Wall have stood in downtown Seoul near Cheonggyecheon stream. They're part of Berlin Square, an open-air plaza built in 2005 and financed by the City of Berlin, in the hope that it will be a place where Seoul citizens will pray for or consider the reunification of the Korean Peninsula. According to the Korea Times, the pieces of the Wall here stand 3.5 meters tall and 3 meters wide, with one side full of graffiti and the other side blank. The Wall is accompanied by a traditional German-style gas lamp and statue of a blue bear, the symbol of Berlin. Near Jiangtong Bridge, Cheonggyecheon stream, Seoul . Western Station, Brown Line, Chicago . In Western station on the Chicago Transit Authority's Brown Line in the traditionally German Lincoln Square neighborhood stands a 3.6-meter-tall, 1.2-meter-wide portion of the Berlin Wall. The segment was erected in the station on January 19, 2008. It was given to the city of Chicago by the Senate and City of Berlin to be displayed ""as a commemorative relic for viewing by the citizens of Chicago and by the public,"" according to the CTA. Western station (Brown Line), 4648 N. Western Ave., Chicago . Vatican Gardens, Vatican City . A chunk of the Berlin Wall was transplanted to Vatican City in August 1994. In the graceful garden where popes have been meditating and relaxing since the 13th century, the Wall is decorated with a painting of St. Michael's Church. According to ITN Source, former Ferrari motor sport director and team manager of its Formula 1 team, Marco Piccinini, won the portion at an auction in Monte Carlo in 1990 and gave it as a gift it to the Vatican in 1994.

"(CNN) -- I vividly recall those 13 days in the fall of 1962, watching President John F. Kennedy on our black and white television in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I was a professor at MIT focusing on the emerging field of leadership studies, and the Cuban Missile Crisis was about leadership writ large for the world to witness. Fifty years after the Kennedy assassination, there is conversation everywhere about JFK's unrealized potential. Amid the wave of sentimental reflection this year, there has been much focus on the mythical elements of Camelot or too many details about that tragic day in Dallas, and not enough on the real-world challenges of the JFK presidency. I believe Kennedy's legacy as a leader during the immensely difficult times of the early 1960s has been underestimated -- today, his imprint on the world political scene is powerful and far-reaching. From the outset of his presidency, Kennedy had a great deal to prove to the country and to his hometown of Boston. There was a saying that the 617 area code, which included Boston and Cambridge, was the most opinionated enclave in the country, which I believe to be accurate. Many of my colleagues and friends at MIT and Harvard were skeptical of Kennedy. There was a sentiment that perhaps he did not have the gravitas to be president, that he was too young, too inexperienced, too dependent upon his powerful family. I met John Kennedy in 1959 in Hyannis Port during the early stages of his presidential campaign, and would later serve on a Federal Aviation Administration task force that he created. I was initially impressed with him -- he was engaging and moved easily from the daily demands of campaign responsibilities to the larger issues before him in the presidential race. Still, after he was inaugurated in January 1961, we could not have predicted how the presidency would unfold. For me, and for many others, the defining moment of his administration remains the Cuban Missile Crisis. Watching Kennedy and his team play one of the highest stakes poker games that the world had witnessed was at once exhilarating and frightening. His mastery of diplomacy and politics succeeded in getting the Russians to withdraw nuclear missiles from Cuba. This was a very different Kennedy from the uncertain president who failed miserably in the Bay of Pigs invasion. The difference? JFK had learned from his mistakes and the groupthink mentality of the Bay of Pigs. His management of the Cuban Crisis became a legendary example of a leader drawing the best from multiple advisers and making his decisions only after weighing each very different contribution. Kennedy learned that in order to succeed, he must create a culture of candor among his inner circle, that he needed the confidence to hear their truths, and his team in turn the courage and freedom to speak those truths. This remains today a lesson that far too few presidents -- or CEOs -- since Kennedy have embraced. The successful outcome of the Cuban Missile Crisis would not have been possible had Kennedy not recruited some of the sharpest minds of his era, those David Halberstam would later famously describe as the best and the brightest. Kennedy intentionally made government service attractive, to ambitious, intelligent achievers through his diverse cabinet and state department appointments. Much like Thomas Jefferson, Kennedy believed in the value of great ideas and people, surrounding himself with the smartest people in any room. But perhaps Kennedy's greatest quality as a leader was his ability to inspire -- to reach the American people on an emotional and personal level. Like FDR, Kennedy transcended a patrician background to touch the hearts of everyday Americans. His inaugural speech set the tone for his presidency, and when he implored an optimistic audience to do for their country, they listened and responded. They believed in him as he launched an aggressive space exploration program, they volunteered as he created a new global volunteer program called the Peace Corps, they followed the every move of his beautiful wife and children. Almost 50 years after that horrific day in Dallas, Caroline Kennedy -- the only living member of JFK's Camelot -- stood in front of a Senate committee and was confirmed as the U.S. ambassador to Japan. She captured the enduring leadership legacy of her father as she pledged that she was committed to ""public service, a more just America and a more peaceful world."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Warren Bennis.","Warren Bennis: JFK had a lot to prove to people when he was elected .

"(CNN) -- This year marked the 50th anniversary of one of the most pivotal years in American history, from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy to the historic ""I Have a Dream"" speech by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Those two events were monumental, changing and shaping the course of America for years to come. But 1963 witnessed other moments, both big and small, that had a lasting impact. The Boeing 727 took its first flight. The first push-button telephone was introduced. The ""red phone"" between Washington and Moscow, a hotline by the two superpowers to avert world crisis, was established. On the cultural front, instant replay was used for the first time when the Army-Navy game aired on CBS. Alfred Hitchcock's new movie, ""The Birds,"" was released. And the Beatles burst onto the music scene. Here is a look back at some of those defining moments: . The Kennedy assassination . It marked the fourth time a U.S. president had been assassinated, the first since William McKinley was killed in 1901. Kennedy was visiting Texas amid controversy over his stance on civil rights. Yet the streets of Dallas were packed on November 22, 1963. Thousands greeted the president and first lady as the motorcade wound its way through the city. The nation came to a standstill shortly after shots rang out. Kennedy was declared dead at 1 p.m. -- a moment etched in television history when CBS anchor Walter Cronkite removed his glasses, paused and collected himself to deliver the news to the nation. 5 things you may not know about the JFK assassination . Hundreds of conspiracy theories would abound later as to whether gunman Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. But in the days and weeks afterward, the nation mourned together. Another iconic image emerged from that time, of Kennedy's son, John Jr., standing at attention next to the president's flag-draped coffin. One JFK conspiracy that may be true . March on Washington . Civil rights in the United States was pushed to the fore in June 1963 with a series of events: Kennedy addressed the nation to call for civil rights legislation; civil rights activist Medgar Evers was assassinated at his home in Jackson, Mississippi; and a defiant Gov. George Wallace stood in the doorway at the University of Alabama barring blacks from entering, until the federal government ordered him to step aside. Why some movements work and others wilt . Those events brought the issue of equality for all to Main Street and enlightened many Americans on the brutality faced by blacks in the South. It also emboldened civil rights leaders as they brought their message -- along with hundreds of thousands of supporters -- to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, culminating with King's iconic ""I Have a Dream"" speech on August 28, 1963. How much has changed since the March on Washington? 'I Have a Dream' almost didn't make it into the speech . The 16th Street Bombing . Just weeks after the March on Washington, the civil rights movement was thrust into the headlines again -- this time the result of unspeakable tragedy. A bomb went off on September 15, 1963, at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, killing four African-American girls. So tragic was the event that one Southern editor wrote about how one of the grieving mothers held her daughter's shoe outside the bombed building: ""In her hand she held a shoe, one shoe, from the foot of her dead child. We hold that shoe with her."" One small shoe: A legacy of the Birmingham bombing . Many historians credit the horror of the 16th Street Bombing with turning the tide in Congress, resulting in the passage of the historic civil rights bill the following year. Siblings of the bombing . Letter from Birmingham Jail . In early 1963, King helped organize a massive protest in Birmingham, one of the most violently segregationist cities in the South. But the protests faltered because activists couldn't summon enough participants and were running out of bail money for those who had been arrested. King decided he needed to do something dramatic -- and provoked his arrest by leading a demonstration on April 12, Good Friday. In jail, King read an ad placed in a local newspaper by eight moderate white clergymen who called him an outside agitator and lawbreaker and counseled him to wait. King didn't take their advice. Scribbling in the margins of the newspaper or on whatever paper he could find, he unloaded on the clergymen. Writing only from memory, he cited Socrates, St. Augustine, the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber and the theologian Paul Tillich. He gave his writing to his lawyer, who smuggled it out of jail, had it typed up and copied. It was published by the Quakers as a pamphlet and appeared in the Christian Century, Atlantic Monthly and Saturday Evening Post. King's ""Letter From Birmingham Jail"" became a chapter in his popular 1964 book, ""Why We Can't Wait,"" and is considered a classic defense of civil disobedience. How MLK became an angry black man . Beatlemania . It may seem silly to refer to the Beatles as the original boy band, but that's what they were in 1963. The release of the British band's debut album, ""Please Please Me,"" on March 22, 1963, was the start of a cultural revolution that would change the music landscape for decades to come. In a single year, the Beatles went from relative obscurity to playing in front of 73 million Americans on ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" That year also witnessed the launch of other musicians who became icons, including the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. The lasting impact of their revolution influenced not just music, but modern art, design and fashion for decades to come.

"(CNN) -- Turkey's fraught relationship with France is set to erode further after the French Senate passed controversial legislation criminalizing any public denial of what the bill calls the Armenian genocide in Ottoman Turkey in 1915 -- a description Turkey has rejected. Under the legislation, anyone denying the deaths were genocide could face a jail term and a fine of â‚¬45,000 ($58,000). The lower house of French parliament passed the so-called Armenian genocide bill last December, prompting Turkey to recall its ambassador from Paris and to cancel certain bilateral visits between the countries. The French Senate then voted late Monday to approve the bill. What do Armenians say allegedly happened in 1915? Armenian groups and many scholars argue that starting in 1915, Turks committed genocide, when more than a million ethnic Armenians were massacred in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish-Armenian controversy over the killings that took place last century has reverberated wherever diaspora communities representing both groups exist. What does Turkey say happened in 1915? Modern-day Turkey, which emerged after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, has always denied a genocide took place in 1915. It argues instead that hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians and Muslim Turks died from intercommunal violence, disease and general chaos -- not from a specific plan to eliminate Armenians -- around the bloody battlefields of World War I. ""It has always been a sensitive issue,"" said Dr. Katerina Dalacoura, a lecturer in International Relations at the London School of Economics. ""Turkey has always refused to accept that it was a planned event. They argue that genocide only applies if it was a plan to exterminate people."" Why is France doing this now? France formally recognized the killings as genocide in 2001. As there is no new information or new recognition about what the facts are about events of 1915, some experts believe French President Nicolas Sarkozy may be using the genocide bill for political gain ahead of the country's presidential election in April. ""It's clear that President Sarkozy has put this on the table for electoral reasons - there is an Armenian community in France which will of course be voting,"" Christian Malard, Senior Foreign Analyst at France 3 TV, told CNN on Monday. The bill has been applauded by Armenians, roughly 500,000 of whom live in France. The bill's author, Valeri Bouyer from Sarkozy's ruling party, has denied any political motivation. As for Sarkozy, he has said his country doesn't need an OK from another nation to develop its policies. In a letter to the Turkish government, he said the law is not aimed at any country, but only at addressing past suffering. What is the public opinion in Turkey regarding the Armenian massacre? Using the word genocide when talking about Armenia may not be as taboo as it once was, but Turks still chafe at the idea of other countries writing their history, says Fadi Hakura, Turkey Analyst at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. ""Things have been progressing, but the population does not like foreign powers defining their history,"" he said. ""It generates a lot of misgivings."" How would passage of the genocide bill affect Turkey-France relations? Ties between the two countries could now unravel further. Turkey already recalled its ambassador from Paris and cancelled some bilateral visits between the two countries after the French lower house passed the bill in December, and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned ""this is only the first phase."" Erdogan has also accused France of committing its own genocide during the war in Algeria in the 1950s and 1960s. ""In Algeria, an estimated 15 percent of the population had been subjected to the massacre of French from 1945 on. This is genocide,"" Erdogan said at a conference in Istanbul last year. ""Algerians were burnt en masse in ovens. They were martyred mercilessly. If French President Mr. (Nicolas) Sarkozy does not know about this genocide, he should ask his father Paul Sarkozy. His father Paul Sarkozy served as a soldier in the French legion in Algeria in 1940s."" Once under French colonial rule, guerrillas in the North African nation fought a bloody war against the French presence there from 1954 to 1962. The French Foreign Ministry shot back at Erdogan's comments, saying ""we deplore excessive use of formulas and personal attacks that do not meet up to the standards of our mutual interest and of our relations. France recalls that it assumes with clarity and transparency its duty to remember the tragedies that have marked its history."" Erdogan has said that passage of the bill would result in Turkey initiating additional measures against France. ""This will create a lot of noise and difficulty in Turkey's overall relationships with France and other EU states that will complicate"" Turkey's efforts to gain accession to the European Union, said Ross Wilson, a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey. Turkey and France are NATO allies, and, according to official Turkish statistics, the volume of trade between Turkey and France from January to the end of October this year was more than $13.5 billion. Do any countries recognize the killing of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey in 1915 as genocide? Twenty countries do, including Germany, Sweden and Canada, according to Hakura. The genocide debate is an annual source of tension between Turkey and the United States, also two NATO allies. The White House, for example, annually beats back efforts in Congress to pass a resolution which would formally recognize the 1915 massacre of Armenians as genocide. CNN's Izzy Lemberg and CNN Wires contributed to this report.","French Senate passes bill criminalizing public denial of Armenian genocide in Ottoman Turkey in 1915 .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is the first American leader in decades to visit Malaysia, the Asian nation grappling with the mystery of a vanished jetliner. Obama landed in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, seven weeks to the day Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people aboard. He's remained largely quiet over the issue amid an international underwater search focusing on the southern Indian Ocean. At an elaborate dinner at Istana Negara palace, attended by some 600 guests, Paramount Ruler Tuanku Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah offered a toast in English and personally thanked Obama for U.S. support in the aftermath of the plane's disappearance. A day before his arrival, he told a Malaysian newspaper, The Star, that the U.S. remains committed to the search. ""The United States was one of the first countries to join in the search for the missing plane,"" he said. ""U.S. Navy ships, aircraft and personnel remain on the scene, assisting in the search. Our FBI is working closely with Malaysia on the investigation into what caused the aircraft to disappear. And we'll continue to offer our support and assistance as the search and investigation continue."" Obama will discuss the search for the missing plane with Malaysia's Prime Minister, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters, but it will not be the only item on the agenda. Malaysia is a growing partner of the United States, which seeks to deepen that relationship, Rhodes said. Topics of discussion between the two leaders will include trade, security and regional issues, he said. Narrowed search nears end . Because of inclement weather, the planned air and sea search for Sunday was suspended, the Joint Agency Coordination Center said. The Bluefin-21 search was expected to take place. Obama's visit comes as the initial search by the Bluefin-21 nears its end. The submersible, which is on contract to the U.S. Navy, is scouring the ocean floor for traces of the plane. Previously, another device, a ""towed pinger locator"" detected signals that officials believed were from its flight recorders, which determined the current search area for the Bluefin. The underwater sonar device plunged into the Indian Ocean on Saturday, kicking off its 14th mission. It has slowly scoured 95% of the ocean floor that searchers had narrowed down for it. So far, it has found no trace of the missing jetliner. If the Bluefin-21 searches 100% of the area with nothing to show for it, the underwater search may expand Australian officials said. On Saturday, the British ship HMS Echo returned to port in Perth for replenishment after assisting in the search. A U.S. Navy source told CNN on Friday that the current search area is expected to move slightly north if the Bluefin doesn't find any wreckage. Specifically, it might shift to encompass a 6-mile radius around where another ""ping"" was detected. The underwater search so far has focused on a circle with a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) radius around the location of a detected ""ping,"" the Joint Agency Coordination Center said. ""We are currently consulting very closely with our international partners on the best way to continue the search into the future,"" the Australian-based center coordinating the search said in a statement. The plane disappeared after leaving Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for Beijing. Preliminary report . Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has said a preliminary report on the plane's disappearance will be available to the public next week. He also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week, his office said. The report has been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N. body for global aviation, but not yet made available to the public. The U.N. organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by Malaysia that the aviation world needs to look at real-time tracking of commercial aircraft. It's the same recommendation that was made after the Air France Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. ""Anytime there is a tragedy like this we ought to also reflect on what can be done going forward to prevent something similar from happening again,"" Obama said. ""That discussion has begun in Malaysia and around the world, and we'll see what improvements might be recommended to continue improving aviation security. One thing is already clear, however, is that large international efforts like this search operation benefit from existing partnerships among nations."" Obama, who will be in Malaysia until Sunday, is the first U.S. president to visit Kuala Lumpur in almost 50 years. He leaves for the Philippines on Sunday, where he will remain until his departure for the United States on Tuesday. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph, Mike Ahlers, Sumnima Udas, David Molko, Catherine E. Shoichet and John Berman contributed to this report.","NEW: Sunday air and sea search suspended because of weather .

"Washington (CNN) -- Changing the Constitution's guarantee of U.S. citizenship for anyone born in the United States is ""worth considering"" if it helps reduce illegal immigration, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives said Sunday. ""It's a serious problem that affects our country, and in certain parts of our country clearly our schools, our hospitals are being overrun by illegal immigrants. A lot of them came here just so their children could become U.S. citizens. They should do it the legal way,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" The Ohio congressman, who could become speaker of the House if Republicans win back control of the chamber in November, is the latest GOP leader to float the idea of changing the 14th Amendment. Several leading GOP senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and 2008 presidential nominee John McCain, have said they would support holding hearings into the matter as part of the heated debate over immigration. The Reconstruction-era amendment guarantees equal protection of law and defines who is a U.S. citizen. Critics of illegal immigration have long accused migrants -- particularly those coming from Mexico or Latin American countries -- of giving birth to children in the United States in hopes that their babies' citizenship will keep them in the country. The amendment has been cited as the foundation of U.S. civil rights law in cases ranging from Brown v. Board of Education to last week's decision that struck down a ban on same-sex marriage in California. Changing it would require a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress and the approval of three-quarters of state legislatures. Boehner said Sunday he's ""not the expert on this issue,"" but ""I think it's worth considering."" ""There is a problem,"" he told NBC. ""To provide an incentive for illegal immigrants to come here so that their children can be U.S. citizens does, in fact, draw more people to our country.""","Boehner says current law draws illegal immigrants .

"(CNN) -- America's top military official nudged the nation's newest class of officers Saturday to fight a different sort of battle and close a gap between themselves and civilians who do not always understand a soldier's sacrifice. Navy Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point that despite a decade at war, men and women in uniform are not always on the radar of America's non-military families. ""Our work is appreciated, of that I am certain,"" Mullen said in a commencement speech Saturday. ""There isn't a town or a city I visit where people do not convey to me their great pride in what we do."" ""But I fear they do not know us. I fear they do not comprehend the full weight of the burden we carry or the price we pay when we return from battle,"" he said. He spoke to more than 1,000 young officers who grew up with America at war in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""When this country was attacked on 9/11, most of you were just 11 or 12 years old,"" Mullen said. ""We've been at war nearly half your young lives. Yet all you made a choice freely to serve your country."" He said he was giving the newly commissioned officers an additional assignment over their duty to serve. America's all-volunteer military of 1.4 million members, he said, was a small, insular force compared to the general population -- scattered on bases across America or deployed to faraway places. It was imperative that the public know more about the men and women who choose to serve, he said. ""This is important, because a people uninformed about what they are asking the military to endure is a people inevitably unable to fully grasp the scope of the responsibilities our Constitution levies upon them,"" Mullen said. Both Mullen and Defense Secretary Robert Gates have previously sounded concern over potential alienation of the military and have urged more dialogue to end the disconnect.","Adm.

"(CNN)  -- When the Democratic National Committee meets Saturday on the thorny issue of seating the Florida and Michigan delegations at its August convention, party officials will have to fashion a solution that satisfies supporters of Sen. Hillary Clinton and presidential nominee front-runner Sen. Barack Obama. Sen. Barack Obama showed he was willing to use bare-knuckle tactics during his first race in Chicago. It may take a Solomon-like decision to appease both candidates. Clinton has argued that the primary results of two of the nation's largest states should count because, otherwise, millions of voters are being disenfranchised. Obama has said he is willing to work out some compromise. But he is insistent that the primary results are invalid because the two states failed to follow party rules and that the rules are the rules. The DNC has not seated the Florida and Michigan delegates because the two states violated party edicts in holding their primaries early. Although neither candidate campaigned in the two states, Clinton won about 50 percent of the Florida vote, compared with 33 percent for Obama. She won 55 percent of the vote in Michigan, where Obama's name was not on the ballot. In his first race for office, seeking a state Senate seat on Chicago's gritty South Side in 1996, Obama effectively used election rules to eliminate his Democratic competition. As a community organizer, he had helped register thousands of voters. But when it came time to run for office, he employed Chicago rules to invalidate the voting petition signatures of three of his challengers. The move denied each of them, including incumbent Alice Palmer, a longtime Chicago activist, a place on the ballot. It cleared the way for Obama to run unopposed on the Democratic ticket in a heavily Democrat district. ""That was Chicago politics,"" said John Kass, a veteran Chicago Tribune columnist. ""Knock out your opposition, challenge their petitions, destroy your enemy, right? It is how Barack Obama destroyed his enemies back in 1996 that conflicts with his message today. He may have gotten his start registering thousands of voters. But in that first race, he made sure voters had just one choice.""  Watch how Obama shut out challengers in his first race » . Obama's challenge was perfectly legal, said Jay Stewart of the Chicago's Better Government Association. Although records of the challenges are no longer on file for review with the election board, Stewart said Obama is not the only politician to resort to petition challenges to eliminate the competition. ""He came from Chicago politics,"" Stewart said. ""Politics ain't beanbag, as they say in Chicago. You play with your elbows up, and you're pretty tough and ruthless when you have to be. Sen. Obama felt that's what was necessary at the time, that's what he did. Does it fit in with the rhetoric now? Perhaps not."" The Obama campaign called this report ""a hit job."" It insisted that CNN talk to a state representative who supports Obama, because, according to an Obama spokesman, she would be objective. But when we called her, she said she can't recall details of petition challenges, who engineered them for the Obama campaign or why all the candidates were challenged. But Will Burns does. Now running himself for a seat in the Illinois legislature, Burns was a young Obama volunteer during the presidential candidate's first race. Burns was one of the contingents of volunteers and lawyers who had the tedious task of going over each and every petition submitted by the other candidates, including those of Alice Palmer. ""The rules are there for a reason,"" Burns said. He said that challenging petitions is a smart way to avoid having to run a full-blown expensive race. ""One of the first things you do whenever you're in the middle of a primary race, especially in primaries in Chicago, because if you don't have signatures to get on the ballot, you save yourself a lot of time and effort from having to raise money and have a full-blown campaign effort against an incumbent,"" Burns said. Burns said he believed that Obama did not enjoy using the tactic to knock off Palmer. ""It was not something he particularly relished,"" Burns said. ""It was not something that I thought he was happy about doing.""  Watch Burns describe how Obama used the rules to his advantage » . But Obama did it anyway, clearing the field of any real competition. Obama's staff would not comment on what the senator thinks about that petition challenge now. Instead, they referred CNN to this 2007 comment made by Obama to the Chicago Tribune. ""To my mind, we were just abiding by the rules that had been set up,"" the senator is quoted as saying in the Tribune. ""My conclusion was that if you couldn't run a successful petition drive, then that raised questions in terms of how effective a representative you were going to be."" But in that same newspaper story, Obama praised Palmer. ""I thought she was a good public servant,"" he said. Palmer, who has campaigned for Clinton, told CNN that she did not want to be part of this story. Obama supporters claim that Palmer has only herself to blame because she indicated she would not run for the 1996 state Senate and instead aimed for Congress. After losing in that bid, she returned to running for the state Senate seat, a move Obama supporters claim amounted to reneging on a promise not to run. But Palmer supporters, who did not want to be identified, said that she never anointed Obama as her successor and that the retelling of the story by Obama supporters is designed to distract from the fact he muscled his way into office. One other opponent who Obama eliminated by challenging his petitions, Gha-is Askia, said he has no hard feelings today about the challenge and supports Obama's presidential aspirations. But back at the time he was running for state Senate, Askia said, he was dismayed Obama would use such tactics. ""It wasn't honorable,"" he said. ""I wouldn't have done it."" He said the Obama team challenged every single one of his petitions on ""technicalities."" If names were printed instead of signed in cursive writing, they were declared invalid. If signatures were good but the person gathering the signatures wasn't properly registered, those petitions also were thrown out. Askia came up 69 signatures short of the required number to be on the ballot. Kass, the Chicago Tribune columnist, said the national media are naive when it comes to Chicago politics, which is a serious business. He said they have bought into a narrative that Obama is strictly a reformer. The truth, Kass says, is that he is a bare-knuckled politician. And using the rules to win his first office is part of who Obama is. ""It's not the tactics of 'let's all people come together and put your best ideas forward and the best ideas win,' "" Kass said. ""That's the spin; that's in the Kool-Aid. You can have some. Any flavor. But the real deal was, get rid of Alice Palmer. ""There are those who think that registering people to vote and getting them involved in politics and then using this tactic in terms of denying Alice Palmer the right to compete, that these things are inconsistent. And guess what? They are. They are inconsistent. But that's the politics he plays."" And this weekend, DNC delegates will have to decide what kind of rules it will invoke in helping choose its next candidate.","Sen.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani court Monday gave police two weeks to prepare their case for charging five Americans whom police suspect of planning terrorist attacks. Authorities have said they plan to prosecute the five men -- who are being held in jail -- under the country's anti-terrorism act. A court hearing was set for January 18. Police have said they are confident that the Americans were planning terrorist acts, according to Tahir Gujjrar, deputy superintendent of police in Sargodha, where the men were arrested December 9. Gujjrar told CNN a preliminary investigation suggests that the men came to Pakistan to wage jihad and had sought to link up with Jaish-e-Mohammed and Jamaat-ud-Dawa militant organizations, neither of which showed interest, he said. The men wanted to martyr themselves, he said. Jaish-e-Mohammed is the group believed to be responsible for the murder of journalist Daniel Pearl. But Mohammed Ameer Khan Rokhri, an attorney representing the men, said they testified on the Quran, the Muslim holy book, ""that they have no connection with any banned organization,"" including Jaish-e-Mohammed or al Qaeda. They told the court, ""We are going to Afghanistan to help the Muslims who have been injured by the NATO forces and other Afghan forces,"" the attorney said. And they said the didn't intend to commit any crime in Pakistan, he said. The five young men are identified as Ahmed Abdullah Minni, Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, Waqar Hussain Khan and Ramy Zamzam. All are in their early 20s except Yemer, who, according to the interrogation report from Pakistani police, is 18 years old. Two of the suspects are Pakistani-American, two are Yemeni-American, and one is Egyptian-American. A sixth man, Khaled Farooq -- the father of Umar Farooq -- also was arrested, but was released by the anti-terror court for lack of evidence. The five men worshipped together at a mosque in Alexandria, Virginia, until they went missing in November and turned up in Pakistan. Fellow congregants at the ICNA Center said they were shocked by the arrests and accusations.

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Army Maj. Nidal Hasan challenged a witness's account of the police shootout that ended a rampage at Fort Hood that left 13 people dead, a rare courtroom exchange from a man who has admitted to opening fire on soldiers deploying to Afghanistan and Iraq. The exchange occurred after prosecution witness Sgt. Juan Alvarado testified to seeing Hasan shoot a police officer and then shoot her again while she was down. Hasan is acting as his own attorney, defending himself against 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in connection with the November 5, 2009, attack. ""I don't want to put words in your mouth. Are you saying that she was disarmed and that I continued to fire at her?"" Hasan asked. Alvarado responded: ""Yes."" ""I have no more questions,"" Hasan said. For his part, Hasan has said little during the death penalty trial, other than to say he was the shooter. But on Monday, Hasan appeared to be casting doubt on Alvarado's testimony that he shot a wounded, unarmed female police officer. The officer earlier testified that after Hasan shot her, he kicked her weapon out of her reach. Hasan has left no doubt about his role, telling a panel of 13 officers during a brief opening statement: ""The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter."" He's also left little question about why he did it, repeatedly saying before the trial started that he was acting to protect Taliban leaders in Afghanistan from the U.S. military. Fast Facts: Soldier on Soldier Attacks . While the military has avoided labeling Hasan a terrorist or charging him as such, prosecutors wanted to use the evidence to show that the devout Muslim had undergone a ""progressive radicalization,"" going so far as to give academic presentations in defense of suicide bombings. Hasan, who was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan, did not want to fight against other Muslims and believed ""that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible,"" lead prosecutor Col. Michael Mulligan has said. The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, excluded much of the evidence that the prosecution contends goes to the heart of the motive for the attack, including e-mail communications between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born cleric who officials say became a key member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He was killed in U.S. drone strike in 2011. Osborn ruled that the e-mails would have to be ""redacted to prevent undue prejudice by association"" and would diminish its use as evidence. She also declined to allow prosecutors to use materials they maintain show Maj. Nidal Hasan's interest in the actions of Army Sgt. Hasan Akbar, the American soldier sentenced to death for killing two soldiers and wounding more than a dozen others at the start of the Iraq war -- an attack he said he carried out to stop soldiers from killing Muslims. ""The court believes Sgt. Akbar is not on trial in this case,"" Osborn said. ""It would only open the door to a mini-trial"" and confuse the issue. Fort Hood victims feel betrayed . Along with the e-mails and the material related to Akbar, Osborn also declined to allow the use of Hasan's academic presentation on suicide bombings, saying ""motive is not an element of the crime."" The judge did allow prosecutors to use evidence of Hasan's Internet searches on jihad and the Taliban in the days and hours before the attack. Just two hours before the shooting, a search of Hasan's Acer netbook computer showed that someone had pulled up and read an article entitled ""Pakistan Taliban Chief Urges Taliban to Fight Army,"" FBI Special Agent Charles Cox III, a computer forensics examiner, testified. With the prosecution expected to rest as early as Tuesday, the big question is whether Hasan will take the stand. Hasan, 42, has previously indicated that he intends to call himself and two witnesses to the stand. If he testifies, Hasan is expected to discuss the religious justification for his actions. Much has been made about Hasan's defense or, as his stand-by attorneys have said, the lack of it, indicating he is perhaps more eager to prove he is a martyr than to avoid a death sentence. Hasan refused to enter a plea at the outset of the court-martial after the judge barred him from pleading guilty. Under military law, defendants cannot enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases. The judge on Monday raised again concerns about Hasan acting as his own attorney after he admitted last week he did not understand that by listing someone as a witness he gave up the right of privileged communication with that person. ""Remember when I told you that I thought you would be better off with a trained lawyer?"" Osborn asked. Hasan responded: ""Repeatedly."" ""I've advised you before and I'm advising you again that it's not a good policy to represent yourself. ... Do you understand that?"" Osborn said. Hasan said: ""Yes, I do."" Military death row: More than 50 years and no executions . Last week, Hasan released a portion of his mental health evaluation to The New York Times. It revealed he believes that being put to death would allow him to become a martyr. ""I'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life. However, if I died by lethal injection I would still be a martyr,"" Hasan told a military panel evaluating whether he was fit to stand trial, according to documents published by the Times. Hasan has been using a wheelchair since being shot by Fort Hood police. He is paralyzed from the chest down. A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, Hasan was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997. But he had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military, saying he had been taunted by people after the September 11 terror attacks that year. In 2006, he inquired about the possibility of filing conscientious objector status. He did not go through with it, and the judge ruled that his inquiry could not be used by prosecutors to show motive.","NEW: Nidal Hasan challenges witness who says Hasan shot officer when she was down .

"(CNN) -- High levels of illegal immigration and crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants are among the key rationales cited by some supporters of a tough new immigration law in Arizona. ""Border violence and crime due to illegal immigration are critically important issues to the people of our state,"" Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said at the signing of the controversial bill, SB 1070. ""There is no higher priority than protecting the citizens of Arizona. We cannot sacrifice our safety to the murderous greed of the drug cartels. We cannot stand idly by as drop houses, kidnappings and violence compromise our quality of life."" Yet, a look at statistics from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency and the FBI indicate that both the number of illegal crossers and violent crime in general have actually decreased in the past several years. According to FBI statistics, violent crimes reported in Arizona dropped by nearly 1,500 reported incidents between 2005 and 2008. Reported property crimes also fell, from about 287,000 reported incidents to 279,000 in the same period. These decreases are accentuated by the fact that Arizona's population grew by 600,000 between 2005 and 2008. According to the nonpartisan Immigration Policy Institute, proponents of the bill ""overlook two salient points: Crime rates have already been falling in Arizona for years despite the presence of unauthorized immigrants, and a century's worth of research has demonstrated that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes or be behind bars than the native-born."" Backers of the bill maintain that crime is a key reason for the necessity of the tough immigration law. Arizona state Sen. Russell Pearce this week told CNN's Tony Harris that half the murders in Phoenix are committed by unauthorized immigrants and that the city is the second in the world in kidnappings. A CNN Fact Check found that the senator's claim about the murders in Phoenix cannot be proven, but he did have police statistics to back up his claims of the city's high number of kidnappings, although its exact standing in the world is not clear. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, Sheriff Joe Arpaio has long been an advocate of tough measures against illegal immigration. His officers already check the immigration status of people they detain for other crimes, he said. ""We've been doing it for a long time, but this [law] gives us just a little more authority,"" Arpaio told CNN. One way that Arpaio says he measures his success is that he hears that immigrants who entered the country illegally are leaving his county. ""It's a good indicator,"" he said. Statewide illegal immigration trends are harder to gauge. One aspect of it is the number of apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants made by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. Since a peak in 2000 of more than 600,000 illegal crossers apprehended, the number fell to 241,000 in 2009, Tucson Sector Public Affairs Officer Mario Escalante told CNN. ""We've seen a steady decline,"" he said. Intelligence-driven operations have increased the effectiveness of the Border Patrol's efforts, he added. Meanwhile, the cartel violence that has gripped Mexico for the most part has remained there, he said. Human and drug smugglers are being ""more aggressive because we're being successful,"" Escalante said, ""But we've been lucky not to see that type of [violence] spill over here.""","FBI statistics: Violent crimes reported declined by nearly 1,500 over four years .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration has decided to release more than $1.6 billion in aid to Pakistan, a senior administration official said. The official told CNN foreign affairs reporter Elise Labott that the decision was made because of improved relations over the past year. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was elected in May, is scheduled to meet President Barack Obama at the White House on Wednesday. ""The visit will highlight the importance and resilience of the U.S.-Pakistan relationship,"" a White House statement said. Tensions with Pakistan escalated after the U.S. military raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. Pakistan expelled some American military trainers, and some U.S. aid was halted that year. The discovery of bin Laden in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, highlighted suspicions by American leaders that some Pakistani security forces may have collaborated with terrorists. Obama chose not to alert Pakistan's authorities before the U.S. raid. Meanwhile, popular opinion in Pakistan has been inflamed by the U.S. incursion to kill bin Laden as well as U.S. drone strikes against suspected terrorists. Sharif promised in his election campaign to try to improve relations with India, a rivalry that underlies the fears of Pakistan's security forces. He was vague about terrorism and other issues of interest to the United States, but analysts said Sharif worked well with U.S. officials as Prime Minister during the 1990s.","U.S.-Pakistan relations strained since raid that killed Osama bin Laden .

"(CNN) -- On December 16, a young medical student in one of India's major cities was gang-raped, her body destroyed by the bodies of the men who allegedly assaulted her and also by the rusting metal bar doctors say they used to penetrate her. The bar removed part of her intestines. The rest were removed in a hospital far from home where she struggled for her life for just a few days. It has taken an attack that lies nearly outside of comprehension to prompt demonstrations, but the outcry has begun. Over the weekend, women rose up in Nepal, protesting outside the prime minister's house against gender-based violence. What are your experiences of being a woman in India? Send us your stories . Egyptian women have faced ceaseless sexualized violence since the start of that country's revolution, but are now protesting to stop the ever-present sexual harassment and assault. According to Eve Ensler, the head of V-Day and One Billion Rising, a movement calling for women to rise up on February 14, 2013, and demand an end to violence, women in Somalia are planning what may be their first-ever major demonstrations against rape and violence. Ensler will be in Mumbai Jan. 4 and Delhi Jan. 7 and will meet with activists and leaders for events aimed at raising awareness of the movement. This groundswell -- what Ensler calls ""a catalytic moment"" -- is the perfect chance for us to consider how we think about subjugation, rape, and degradation of women globally. Gloria Steinem and I have written about how a cult of masculinity is behind the constant violation of women around the world -- that some men brutalize women against their own self-interest because of an addiction to control or domination. To put it plainly: Rape is not about sex. Opinion: Misogyny in India -- We are all guilty . ""Rape is about violence,"" Steinem says, ""proving 'masculine' superiority; often inserting guns and other objects into women's bodies; playing out hostility to other men by invading the bodies of 'their' females, including old women and babies; occupying wombs with sperm of a conquering group; owning female bodies as the means of reproduction; and raping men and boys to make them as inferior as females."" This is born out everywhere that rape occurs but especially in war zones like the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Dr. Denis Mukwege, the medical director of Panzi Hospital, told me men use objects as a means to mark a woman -- to indicate that she now carries the message of violence impressed on her body. She becomes an emblem of terror meant to warn the world that nobody is safe. And while rape in war zones carries its own particular kind of horror, there is no escaping the cult of masculinity geographically. The culture of rape imbues whatever space we inhabit. For women, ""peacetime"" does not exist. Nearly 1 in 5 women in this country surveyed said they had been raped or had experienced an attempted rape at some point, according to the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. That women are expected to put up and shut up is universally understood: A 2012 UNICEF report found that 57 percent of Indian boys and 53 percent of girls between ages of 15 and 19 think wife-beating is justified. A recent study by two nonprofits found that 65 percent of men surveyed in the Democratic Republic of Congo believe ""women should accept partner violence to keep the family together."" And, as in India, where the appalling remarks of Andhra Pradesh Congress chief Botsa Satyanarayana appeared to place blame on the Delhi gang-rape victim -- she chose a strange private bus, she shouldn't have been out after dark -- politicians, clergymen, husbands, and others around the world perpetually blame rape survivors. (See this beauty from an Italian priest. Or reacquaint yourself with the stunners from Rep. Todd Akin or Senate candidate Richard Mourdock.) These are more than just manipulative words; victim-blaming has consequences. Women are literally dying from fault-finding from Syria to Sudan in honor killings, suicides, and murders because they are blamed for their sexual assaults. We have to move the focus off the victim. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that the ""safety and security of women is of the highest concern to our government."" OK. That's one part of the equation. But what about the larger part -- what about prosecuting men who are committing these crimes? Yes, women often do not report sexualized violence. But they do not report because they know that, at least in this country, only three of every 100 men accused of rape will ever spend a day in jail. It's time to focus on the perpetrators. And it's also time for men and women to engage in a consistent dialogue on stopping rape. Let's publicly and privately declare all sexualized violence unacceptable. Let's hold perpetrators legally accountable and once and for all change laws and justice systems that continue to fail women. Let's understand that rape is not a problem that affects only women: It affects families, communities, entire cultures. It is not an inevitability, but the outcome of a system based in discrimination, just as slavery was. Let's declare 2013 The Year to End Rape. If this is a problem that men have created, this is a problem that men can help solve. The time is now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lauren Wolfe.","Lauren Wolfe: Brutal rape that killed an Indian women has caused a global outcry .

"(CNN) -- Somali pirates are notorious for being behind a spate hijackings on the high seas but their activities have also exacerbated food shortages in the Horn of Africa, a senior official from the African Development Bank has said. Professor Mthuli Ncube, who fulfills a dual role as the bank's chief economist and vice president, says that piracy has both prevented and delayed vital food aid from being delivered to Somalia. This has worsened the humanitarian situation inside the country which -- alongside neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia -- is experiencing one of the most severe droughts and subsequent food shortages in living memory, he explains. Some 12.4 million people in the Horn of Africa currently require humanitarian assistance as a result of food shortages, the U.N. estimates. ""[Piracy] affects the transit of food quickly, where it's needed by refugees,"" Ncube says. ""It also brings up the costs of transporting the food and it goes beyond that into tourism, into the exploitation of hydro-carbons ... the issue around fishing and so forth,"" he adds. ""But more urgently it is about delivery of food that is being affected."" Ncube cites the lack of a respected or powerful central authority in Somalia as a key factor in the rise of pirate activity in and around its waters recent years. The country has been without a government since 1991, meaning there is a lack of security and infrastructure that would allow the safe passage of aid to areas worst affected by the droughts. Individual charities and agencies are even being forced to negotiate with armed groups or offer monetary incentives to get help into the country -- at considerable risk to their own staff -- Ncube says. ""Unfortunately the government is at the core of this [issue] and without a government you can't police. There's no military, organized military to provide security,"" he says. ""This is impacting on the ability of anyone to help the people in Somalia, so at the end of the day we just have to deal with the governance. That is the core of everything,"" he adds. Ncube also highlights the lack of protection offered to Somali fisherman from international bodies such as NATO in preventing illegal fishing in Somali waters as another major contributory factor towards piracy. Large scale fishing operations from countries across Europe and Asia have popped up illegally in Somali waters in recent years with no coastguard or navy to stop them, Ncube says. This has depleted fish stocks and forced many Somali fisherman, with no government to petition or act on their behalf, to take up piracy as an alternative source of income, he adds. ""Certainly there's a sense that this was initially a reaction to foreign ships coming in to fish illegally, depleting the stock of fish,"" says Ncube. ""These fishermen then took the law into their own hands and said look we'll start hijacking ships as a way of getting back. Then it became an easy business, a way of life, they got hooked onto it."" ""That issue has not been addressed, at least not from the Somali's point of view,"" he adds. Ncube explains that a lack of urgency from international and regional bodies to address these developments as they occurred has led to the situation snowballing into the key regional issue it is today. In recent years piracy has caused millions of dollars worth of damage to local tourism, fishing and shipping industries, as well as impacting on food security, he says. But with Africa relying the high seas to transport roughly 80% of its goods -- largely due poor roads and a lack of travel infrastructure on the continent -- Ncube says it is vital for governments and international bodies to come together to address the root causes of piracy. He cites giving support to Somalia to address its governance issue and introducing fair legislation that protects Somali fishing waters as key first steps in what will likely be a long and drawn out process. By doing so however, Ncube believes that the region will become a much safer place. Addressing the issue of food security meanwhile, will become much simpler, he adds.","Professor Mthuli Ncube is Chief Economist at the Africa Development Bank.

"(CNN) -- The Vietnam War began in the decade before, but the conflict, and especially U.S. involvement, escalated in the 1960s. For the first time, Americans witnessed the horrors of war, played out on television screens in their living rooms. This week's episode of ""The Sixties"" explores the war and its impact on American culture, then and now. Here are five facts from the episode that may surprise those too young to remember the Vietnam War: . 1. U.S. involvement in Vietnam began with Eisenhower. In the late 1950s, during the Eisenhower administration, Vietnam had split into North Vietnam, which was communist, and South Vietnam. Cold War anxieties dictated that if the North Vietnamese communists prevailed, the rest of Southeast Asia would fall like dominoes. When he took office in 1961, President John F. Kennedy vowed not to allow South Vietnam fall to communism. 2. The United States and South Vietnam had Catholic presidents who were shot to death in November 1963. By the early 1960s, South Vietnam's conventionally trained army was no match for the Vietcong's guerrilla-style tactics. In addition, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority revolted against their president, Ngo Dinh Diem. They saw the Catholic ruler as a tyrant. The Western-educated Diem, however, wielded absolute power and rose to dictator level by the summer of 1963. The CIA discussed toppling the regime. With U.S. knowledge, Diem was killed by South Vietnamese generals on November 2, 1963. Kennedy immediately regretted Diem's death and U.S. support for the coup. Less than three weeks later, on November 22, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office aboard Air Force One later that day. Soon after, Johnson told a grieving nation, ""John Kennedy's death commands what his life conveyed, that America must move forward."" 3. TV forever changed the way Americans viewed war . As casualties rose, the country increasingly turned against the war. The official line was that Americans were winning in Vietnam, but the evening news told a different story. ""What Vietnam did to America via television was introduce us to a new kind of America,"" said author Lawrence Wright. ""One that was not pure, one that committed the same kinds of atrocities that are always committed in war, but we had never allowed ourselves to see them."" Reporter Morley Safer recalled the shock of witnessing Marines burn down 150 houses on the outskirts of the village of Cam Ne. An officer told the newsman that he had been ordered to level the area. Three women were wounded in the attack, one baby was killed, and four people were taken prisoner. Safer asked a soldier if he had regrets about leaving people homeless, and the soldier replied, ""You can't expect to do your job and feel pity for these people."" Another soldier told Safer, ""I think it's sad in a way, but I don't think there's any other way you can get around it in this kind of a war."" Americans back home were stunned when the CBS report about the Cam Ne village hit the news. After the broadcast, Johnson reportedly called then-CBS president, Frank Stanton, and said, ""Frank, this is your President, your boys just s--t on the flag of the United States."" 4. Some Americans resorted to self-mutilation to avoid the draft. When the choices were Vietnam, jail or draft-dodging by going to Canada, some young men panicked and devised ways to fail the military's physical exam, including mutilating themselves, starving or pretending to be gay. The compulsory draft, which had been initiated during World War II, meant registration for young men was mandatory at 18. Working-class men were more likely to get drafted over those in the middle class because college students could get deferments. In January 1965, 5,400 young men were called for the draft. By December of that year, more than 45,000 young men were called. When the monthly draft call rose from 17,000 to 35,000 per month, young people across the nation began engaging in civil disobedience. On November 27, 1965, the March on Washington for Peace in Vietnam took place, attracting tens of thousands of protesters. 5. U.S. troops endured 120-degree temperatures while sitting in swamps. Facing temperatures sometimes of up to 120 degrees F in the wet jungle terrain, soldiers regularly became afflicted with infections such as ringworm. Author and Vietnam veteran Karl Marlantes recalled the difficulty of dealing with losing his friends on the battlefield. ""You'd throw them on a chopper and that'd be the last you'd see of them,"" he said, ""and so you were constantly shoving it down because if you didn't you couldn't function."" Bonus: LBJ feared being remembered for his handling of Vietnam . Johnson, who made great strides with civil rights legislation at home, did not want to be remembered as the American president who lost Southeast Asia. In a taped 1965 conversation, Sen. Richard Russell told Johnson that he ""couldn't have inherited a worse mess."" ""Well, if they say I inherited it, I'd be lucky,"" Johnson said, ""but they'll all say I created it. Dick, the trouble is, the great trouble I'm under, a man can fight if he can see daylight down the road somewhere, but there ain't no daylight in Vietnam. There's not a bit."" Luci Baines Johnson on her father's legacy . When CBS anchor Walter Cronkite, who was called the most trusted man in America, traveled to Vietnam in 1968 and announced it was time for America to pull out, Johnson reportedly old an aide, ""If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America."" Journalist Marvin Kalb noted that Johnson ""realized he was no longer in charge of the war. The war was in charge of him."" In 1968, Johnson announced that he would not be running for re-election.","This week's episode of ""The Sixties"" explores the Vietnam War .

"(CNN) -- Get ready for another addition to the line of Disney heroines: Moana, an ocean adventurer. ""Moana,"" a film about a teenage girl in ""ancient Oceania,"" according to the plot description, is scheduled to make its debut in late 2016. Moana, who is described as a ""born navigator,"" sets out on a voyage to seek a mysterious island. Her primary companion is Maui, a demigod, and together they ""traverse the open ocean on an action-packed voyage, encountering enormous sea creatures, breathtaking underworlds and ancient folklore."" Ron Clements and John Musker (""The Little Mermaid,"" ""The Princess and the Frog"") are directing. Disney has always been a place for princesses -- a tendency that's earned them some criticism over the years -- but it's hard to argue with the box office. Last year's ""Frozen"" is the highest-grossing animated film of all time, and other Disney classics -- including ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Cinderella"" -- have been cash cows for the studio, influencing both popular culture and the bottom line. (More ""Frozen"" is coming, too.) ""Moana"" promises more of the modern version: beautiful, clever and adventurous, said Musker in a statement, according to the Los Angeles Times. ""Moana is indomitable, passionate and a dreamer with a unique connection to the ocean itself,"" he said. ""She's the kind of character we all root for, and we can't wait to introduce her to audiences.""","New Disney heroine: Moana, a navigator from Oceania .

"(CNN) -- For Connor Hays, nothing said summer more than spending a day at Joyland Amusement Park. Back in its prime, the Wichita, Kansas, theme park drew families with novelty rides, carnival food and live entertainment. Hays, now 25, says he visited Joyland at least twice each summer when he was a kid in the 1990s. After moving back to his hometown earlier this year, Hays wanted to revisit his childhood amusement park. But he couldn't. Joyland was no more. The theme park, which had been operating for 55 years, closed in 2004. What Hays found instead was a heap of scraps from a forgotten place. With a camera in hand, the web designer walked carefully through the tall fields of grass that now surround much of the abandoned remnants of the theme park. Within the confines of Joyland, Hays was hit with a rush of memories from his youth. ""My older brother and I would beg my parents to take us,"" Hays said. ""When we got there, we would ride the same three rides over and over again."" Those deep feelings of nostalgia associated with places like local, homegrown theme parks are quite common, according to Jim Futrell, a historian with the National Amusement Park Historical Association. ""In this Internet era, people are looking for something different to do, and a lot of amusement parks are able to capitalize on that,"" he said. Attendance at U.S. theme parks increased by 59 million visitors from 2000 to 2013, said David Mandt, a spokesman for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. The jump in attendance is positive news for an industry that historically goes through cycles of park closures. From 2004 to 2008, amusement parks hit a slump with dozens of theme parks shutting their doors nationwide. This includes several smaller theme parks that closed in the mid-2000s, including some that had survived a century, Futrell said. Ohio's Geauga Lake and Pennsylvania's Bushkill Park, were examples of this trend, Futrell wrote in a 2006 article for Funworld Magazine. Those smaller theme park closures have left a void for some intrepid travelers who are looking for a more nostalgic amusement park experience. Our fascination with abandoned buildings . Jessica Georgia is one of those travelers who is always searching for a vintage or ""Old Americana"" place to explore. It's what brought her and her family to the gates of Land of Oz, a relic theme park, sitting all alone on top of Beech Mountain in North Carolina. Georgia stumbled onto the theme park while doing an online search for interesting places to visit with her family. There wasn't much information she could find on Land of Oz, except that it once operated in the 1970s before closing its doors. What she did find online were photos of a real-life version of ""The Wizard of Oz."" Its yellow bricks, steel gate and lush green trees sparked her curiosity. She and her family visited the park in late May and found that the gates to the theme park were open, so they stepped inside. Georgia, her husband and daughter walked carefully down the yellow brick road. The path was still brightly colored after all these years, with a few bricks missing here and there. ""I don't think you are supposed to walk in the way we did,"" she said. ""The gates are there, there were the yellow bricks, and the shell of what used to be a castle. The Tin Man was also there, and the trees looked like they were looking at you."" Land of Oz may seem like an abandoned theme park, but it's actually not. The amusement park is closed, and the space has been converted into vacation rental property. Visitors can rent out Dorothy's house, which looks like an antique cottage, for two nights or more. Other parts of the park can also be rented for small events. The theme park hasn't been operational since the 1980s, when it first shut down. But the space went through a revival in the 1990s, according to Cynthia Keller, the property manager of Land of Oz and self-appointed ""Keeper of Oz."" Libraries are dying? Think again . ""You get the grounds to yourself, and you can stroll the yellow brick road,"" Keller said. ""We have been doing vacation rentals for the last 20 years."" Spending the night in Dorothy's home and waking up on top of a picturesque mountain is an experience that keeps the park's rental calendar pretty much booked up, Keller said. Even those who aren't hardcore fans of the classic Technicolor movie enjoy spending time at the converted theme park. ""We aren't crazy about 'The Wizard of Oz,' but I definitely had some nostalgia walking through,"" Georgia said. ""I had a lot of childhood memories of watching that movie with my sister when we were little, and being able to pass that experience down to my daughter. It makes you want to be a kid again."" Hays says going to Joyland with his parents always felt like a treat, giving him a ""special feeling that is hard to recreate or describe once you have grown up."" Although Hays doesn't have children yet, he hopes to share that same feeling with his own kids in the future. He plans on taking them to a theme park similar to Joyland. ""There is something about local amusement parks,"" he said. ""When you go to Six Flags, I don't think you have the same emotional connection to that park like a smaller theme park gives you.""","During the mid-2000s, several smaller U.S. theme parks closed their doors for good .
