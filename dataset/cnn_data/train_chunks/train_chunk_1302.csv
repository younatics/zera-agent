"A woman has been sent to jail in secret for refusing to tell a judge where her two children are, the Daily Mail can reveal. The woman - who cannot be named - was imprisoned for 28 days by a High Court family judge last month for failing to obey an order to tell social workers of their whereabouts. No details of the case and the sentence for contempt of court imposed by Mrs Justice Theis have been officially released. The Royal Courts of Justice in London, where the Court of Protection is based. An unnamed woman was imprisoned for 28 days there for failing to obey an order to tell social workers of her children's whereabouts . The imprisonment comes six months after the Daily Mail exposed the treatment of Wanda Maddocks, who was sent to prison in secret by the Court of Protection for her efforts to remove her father from a care home where she thought his life was in danger. Following the Maddocks scandal, judges were instructed that no-one should be imprisoned without their name and the reason for the sentence being published. In guidance to judges in May, the then Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, and the country’s most senior family judge Sir James Munby, warned: ‘This is mandatory. There are no exceptions.’ Officials working for Sir James have said the latest secret imprisonment is, because of a legal technicality, not subject to the rules that say contempt sentencing must be done in public. They added that Sir James, who is president of the Family Division, is now working to close the loophole. His private secretary Alex Clark has written to Lib Dem MP John Hemming, who has been campaigning against secrecy in the courts and who inquired about the new case. Mr Clark said Sir James will ‘look at the practice guidance again’ to see if its ‘scope can be widened’. The Court of Protection was created in 2005 to make decisions for those not able to do so themselves, but it has come under heavy fire in several cases, many of which have been revealed exclusively by the Daily Mail . Mrs Justice Theis committed the woman to jail for contempt in a hearing at the High Court in London on October 11. The woman’s imprisonment was, in legal terms, a committal for contempt ‘of the court’s own motion’. Mr Clark told Mr Hemming: ‘The May guidance does not apply to cases like this one where the court commits someone to prison for contempt of its own motion during the course of other proceedings. ‘I appreciate that to a non-lawyer this may appear to be a distinction without a difference but, in law, this is the position.’ A spokesman for the judiciary said a transcript of the contempt hearing will be published on BAILII, the website on which legal rulings are posted, ‘as soon as possible’.","Woman jailed for 28 days in latest ruling by secretive Court of Protection .

"This attention-seeking seal just wants to play! A new video, with footage captured using a camera mounted on a surfboard, shows an adorable seal climbing all over the surfers and their boards in Lacanau, France. What started off as a normal morning on the water for Bertrand Chaussade and his friends, was quickly hijacked by the small animal, nicknamed 'You,' who was also eager to hang ten. Attention-seeking seal named You just wants to play - with a bunch of French surfers in Lacanau . The animal climbed onto Bertrand Chaussade board, after burrowing under his hands for a pat . In just a few minutes, You had made himself at home on top of Bertrand's surfboard . Each time he attempted to paddle out, You would pop his head out of the water again and attempt to climb on the board - or even Bertrand himself. Although he attempts to remove the animal, eventually Bertrand relents and allows the cute little guy to sit with him. On the rare moment that Bertrand could get the animal off the board, he was able to catch a wave or two . As soon as he sat back down, however, the attention-loving animal was quickly right back by his side . 'He played with us for the whole morning,' Bertrand later wrote online .

"A new analysis shows that only 1 in 8 families could afford the cost of living what's commonly known as the American Dream in 2014. Inspired by the new book 'Chasing the American Dream,' about the cost of the financial crisis, housing bubble, and Great Recession, reporters at USA Today calculated the cost of all those elements that make up the American Dream. For the project they included the costs of home ownership, moderate-cost groceries, a car, health insurance, taxes, educational expenses for your children, and retirement planning. A new study shows only one family in eight can afford home ownership, children, retirement savings, and all the other things typically promised in the American Dream . They reached an average total of $130,357 per year in household income. Here's how USA Today broke down the average expenses to live comfortably and raise children: . Home ownership - $17,062 per year . Groceries - $12,659 for a . family of four . Transportation - $11,039 a year for a four-wheel-drive SUV . Health Care - An average of $9,144 for out-of-pocket costs and premiums . Total taxes - Roughly 30 per cent of all income . Education - $4,000 per year for two children plus approximately $2,500 per child for college savings . Retirement - The maximum pretax contribution to a retirement plan for people under . 50 in this income level is approximately $17,500 . In a country where the median household income is roughly $51,000, that's a dream well out of reach for most people. In fact only 16 million households in America earned that much last year. Thomas Hirschl, a professor at Cornell University who co-authored the book, noted that most people surveyed did not desire to become one of the 1 per cent of earners, only to have a decent life. 'It's not about getting rich and . making a lot of money. It's about security,' he said.   He added that they also wanted to see their children succeed. 'They want to feel that their children are going to have a . better life than they do,' Hirschl added. There are however massive variables depending on where one lives, with cities like Indianapolis and Tulsa being far more affordable than New York or San Francisco when you take taxes and housing costs into account. They also noted that some groups - immigrants for instance - often lived with extended families that helped share the load. Some business owners are even beginning to publicly speak out. Recently, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced a policy to help provide a college education for his employees. 'In the last few years, we have . seen the fracturing of the American dream,' he told reporters. And studies show more Americans understand their situations. A 2008 Brookings Institution poll showed roughly three-quarters of Americans said that the American Dream was harder to attain.","USA Today calculated the cost by adding expenses including home ownership, children, groceries, retirement planning, and health care .

"A young woman has been arrested after she was found by a Florida homeowner sofa on her couch wearing the homeowner's pajamas. Chancy Payton, 19, allegedly broke into the St Augustine home through an unlocked balcony door after she was told by a friend that the home would be empty. Payton told police she entered the home, took a shower and dressed in the homeowners pajamas before making herself some food. Rude awakening: Chancy Payton was discovered sleeping on a sofa belonging to Cheryl Petocz . The blonde-haired young woman fell asleep on the sofa but woke in shock after the homeowner arrived back at her apartment around 2:30am. Cheryl Petocz was shocked to discover a blond-haired stranger sleeping in her home dressed in her clothing. 'Not what I expected to see when I walked into my house. We just stood there a bit, looking at each other, like, ""What do we do?""' Petocz told News4Jax. Petocz was able to snap a picture of the woman before she woke and left in such a rush that she left her bag - with her passport inside - behind. 'There was lots of bottles of wine that she drank. She was clearly not in a clear state.  I told her I was calling police. As soon as I said that, she grabbed few things and ran out the house, out the back door.' St John's County deputies found Payton just a block away from the apartment, still dressed in Petocz's pyjamas. Startled: Payton fled out Petocz's back door, but deputies found her just a block from the St Augustine home . Payton was reportedly apologetic, and wanted to return the pyjamas belonging to Petocz. She began to have trouble breathing, reports News4Jax, and was taken to Flagler Hospital. There, her mother arrived and told police the young woman had been suicidal. Payton told police that she had wanted to 'escape' and find somewhere she could be alone. The friend who told her about the apartment, known only as Jeremy, broke into the home and stole two bottles of wine, leaving the balcony door open for Payton, reports News4Jax. Payton was examined at the hospital before being booked into St John's County Jail and released on $8,000 bail. Police are now looking for 'Jeremy' who could face break-and-enter charges.","Chancy Payton, 19, was found fast asleep on Cheryl Petocz's sofa .

"It has long been known that women can be guilty of faking the throes of passion in the bedroom, but a surprising number of men feign orgasms too, according to research carried out by a Harvard academic. In his new book ‘Why Men Fake it: The Totally Unexpected Truth’, clinical professor of urology Dr Abraham Morgentaler, recounts numerous stories of men confessing that they pretend to climax. But the biggest shock was their reasoning. The big O: It is widely known that women do it, but men are faking it too . ‘The big surprise to me when I started doing this work 25 years ago is that once a man is in a relationship, he seems to care more about his partner than himself,’ said Dr Morgentaler. ‘For every man who behaves badly, I can give you 10 who are dedicated and thoughtful and doing the best they know how to be a man and a solid partner.’ It may seem unbelievable - not to mention physically impossible - but it is indeed possible for men to fake an orgasm, although quite how they do this is kept under wraps by Dr Morgentaler in an interview for online magazine Salon. Dr Morgentaler’s book paints a picture of a gender who are anxious about their erections, feel pressured into having sex and are concerned about their partner’s pleasure. A recent study from the University of Kansas found that 70 per cent of . women and 30 per cent of men admitted faking orgasms. In . the study, both sexes gave the same reasons for pretending - a partner's . orgasm was imminent so they felt under pressure to climax. The . report said: 'The emphasis on men's ability to give their partners . ""earth-shaking orgasms"" sometimes leads both women and men to pretend . orgasm to meet these expectations.' Dr Morgentaler says another reason for the rise in faked orgasms is down to the rapid change in gender identity across society, which has led many men to suffer a crisis of confidence about their masculinity. He cites the case of a 27-year-old paraplegic who can’t feel or move anything from the waist down. Insecure: Dr Morgentaler paints men as remarkably self-conscious in the bedroom . ‘I treat him so that he can have sex, and he comes back and is totally thrilled. His whole personality is different. He says, “It’s fantastic. I feel like a . man again!” But here’s the thing: He feels nothing down there.' Dr Morgentaler explains that the patient feels good about himself as a man - not because he’s getting pleasurable sensations from sex, but because he is able to satisfy his wife. He adds that until around 60 years ago, having sex was understood as a women’s duty rather than something she should enjoy. But now women expect to be pleasured. He illustrates his point with a patient who suffered with erectile dysfunction and was concerned he would never be able to find a partner because, he said, ‘What woman would want to be with a guy that can’t satisfy her?’","A third of men have admitted faking orgasms .

"A wildlife park has banned visitors from wearing leopard print clothing - because it is confusing the animals. Chessington World of Adventures Resort today introduced the zero-tolerance policy on animal print and even brought in bouncers to enforce it. Zookeepers noticed the trend for animal print clothing had caused animals to try to communicate with those wearing it - or to run away in fear. You're a funny-looking leopard: A wildlife park has banned visitors from wearing animal print clothing - because it is confusing the animals . The ban follows the launch of a new . experience 'ZUFARI: Ride Into Africa!', which sees visitors journey . off-road on a safari adventure. They come face-to-face with white rhinos, giraffes, flamingos, waterbuck and other antelopes such as blesbok. Since . the launch of the 22-acre Serengeti-style trail, Chessington's . zookeepers have noticed the wildlife 'becoming puzzled' when spotting . visitors that look like them. ZUFARI spokeswoman Natalie . Dilloway said: 'ZUFARI lets visitors get so close to wild species that . if someone wears the same pattern to the animal's coat they can become . over friendly. 'If they wear the pattern of its predator, it has the opposite effect and the animals become afraid and run away.' Animal . print-wearing visitors will be handed grey boiler suits and ordered to . wear them everywhere in the park so as not to antagonise or excite other . animals including lions and tigers. Spots and stripes: Chessington World of Adventures Resort today introduced the zero-tolerance policy on animal print and brought in bouncers to enforce it . The resort has hired Animal Print Bouncers to identify anyone wearing leggings, coats, tops, hats or dresses which flout the regulations. Banned prints at Chessington World of Adventures Resort include zebra, giraffe, leopard, cheetah, tiger and even hyena and African wild dog. Ms Dilloway added: 'Since the launch of ZUFARI, guests have interacted with the animals more closely than ever before. 'We have noticed a lot of animals becoming baffled by animal-print-wearing guests. 'The enclosures at ZUFARI have been designed to replicate the conditions species face in the wild. 'Therefore it's no wonder animals are getting confused when they see what looks like zebras and giraffes driving across the terrain in a 7.5 tonne truck. Animal behaviour consultant Dr Candy D'Sa, of Alton, Hampshire, said colours and patterns can provoke strong reactions in animals . Zero tolerance: Those who break the rules will be forced to wear boiler suits . 'We kindly ask guests to refrain from wearing animal print at the park.' Animal . behaviour consultant Dr Candy D'Sa, of Alton, Hampshire, said colours . and patterns can provoke strong reactions in animals. She said: 'Certain colourations give warning signals to other animals. 'For . instance the yellow and black stripe of a bee is there as a warning and . leopard print or tiger print will trigger some sort of instinct as . well. 'Colours and patterns are there for a reason in nature - it's about predator-prey interaction. 'My dog has probably never seen a snake in her life but I would expect her to act with trepidation if she saw a stripey snake as opposed to a plain one. 'Movement is also a key trigger. Big cats will start getting interested if someone limps past their enclosure because they look weak. 'Possibly the worst thing you could do is limp past the lion or tiger enclosure in a zebra print outfit.'","Chessington World of Adventures say animals are 'confused'

"The residents of Benefits Street want Channel 4 to film a second series of the show on their road - despite claiming they were 'manipulated' by the broadcaster. They said a follow-up show should focus . on the workers and pensioners living on the road - rather than just five . main characters. White Dee complained that Channel 4 spent 18 months filming everyone on James Turner Street, Birmingham, but then focused on just her and a few neighbours on the show. New series? White Dee, seen hear with her arm round fellow James Turner Street resident Tich on last night's Channel 4 benefits debate, accused the broadcaster of painting a false picture of her life on handouts. However, her fellow residents in James Turner Street have called for a second series of the show to be filmed there . The broadcaster has already said they will be commissioning a second series but it will be filmed in another city altogether. The programme, which has courted controversy, has been a massive ratings success for Channel 4 pulling in more than six million viewers. However, White Dee - whose real name is Deirdre Kelly - said that the broadcaster had made her life living on handouts look cushy. During a live debate on Channel 4, she said: 'You spent up to 18 months, up to two years, to film people that were working, you filmed old age pensioners, you came to parties, you filmed open days, community spirit and boom (you showed)... five of us.' She added: 'It looks great, it looks like a right barrel of laughs. It looks like you are having a great crack. 'Obviously it is just a programme that they put together into 40 minutes that they had spent 18 months filming.'

'I would have no . problem with them coming back for a second series I’m sure it would be a . good thing for all of us,' she said. 'Every popular programme needs a second series.' James Turner Street pensioner George Drummond, 82, also called for a return of the cameras to the road. He . said: 'I think people do need to see the the real side of the street, I . would say at least 50 per cent of people in James Turner Street have . jobs. 'A second show talking about how they live could go a long way to helping. 'If we could show the issues the real people face, rather than the five or six the show focused on, they would be very good.' New series: Anna Korzen, 28, who appeared on Benefits Street, said she would be keen for Channel 4 to record a new series in her road . Caution: Aspiring model SB - whose real name is Sherrell Dillion - said the residents of James Turner Street should be 'careful' before agreeing to be involved in a second series of the show . Model: Single mother SB, seen here on Benefits Street, warned against a second series of the show being filmed in her road . Factory . worker Symphorien Mbuyama, 33, added: 'I think the people should come . back and film here again, show the world what the street is really like. 'That show has done damage, so they should be making efforts to fix what they have caused. 'I would like to see them come back and show the positive things and make a positive difference to any problems.' New series: George Drummond, 82, said a new series of the programme could focus on the people in the road who have jobs . Benefits Street aspiring model 'SB' - real name Sherrell Dillion - warned against a second series of the show. 'I know there was a big controversy about the programme so for them to do a second series would be weird,' she said. 'A lot of people have got a lot of stick so I hope people know what they are getting themselves into. 'But they might want to do it for the fame or what might happen after the show. 'I think everybody should be careful, they didn’t even tell some people it was going to be called Benefits Street until the week before it started.' Last week Love Productions revealed they are already planning a second series - but they were looking for potential locations outside of Birmingham. A spokesman said: Love Productions are in development and researching potential new locations for a second series of Benefits Street. 'The first series ignited an important debate about the welfare system and we are interested in seeing if we can revisit this through the experiences of residents of a street in a different part of Britain.'

"She established her reputation for calculated malice in a one-line message designed to devastate her love-rival. Valerie Trierweiler, the 47-year-old girlfriend of French President Francois Hollande, caused outrage when she used her Twitter account to publicly back a political opponent of Segolene Royal, Mr Hollande's ex-partner and mother of his four children. Ms Royal, 58, went on to lose her bid to become MP for La Rochelle earlier this month, later blaming the hated Ms Trierweiler for a vicious stab-in-the-back which effectively ended her career. Cheesy: France's controversial new first lady . Valerie Trierweiler (left) gushed over Francois Hollande in her new book where she also talks about the mother of the . President's four children Segolene Royal (right) Corny: The book detailing Francois Hollande's rise to power was written by his partner Valerie Trierweiler and contains photographs by Stephane Ruet . Now Ms Trierweiler, a glossy magazine . journalist, has twisted the knife even further by supplying the captions . for a new book tracing her own career elevation to First Lady of . France. In 'François Hollande, President', she . writes highly personal – and some would say extremely catty - . commentaries beside a range of colour photographs. One shows Mr Hollande and Ms Royal, . who lived together for 30 years after falling in love as students, at a . political rally in Rennes, Brittany, earlier this year. 'Ah, the Rennes rally! Or rather, the . Hollande-Royal rally,' writes Ms Trierweiler scornfully. 'In short, the . Francois-Segolene reunion. Lots has been written since the start of the . week, the photographers are here en masse.' Beside a photograph of the two . ex-lovers together, Ms Trierweiler writes: 'Are they going to kiss, hold . hands? This is the crucial question my colleagues are asking.' As well as Ms Royal's status as an . ex-lover, Ms Trierweiler points to her status as an ex-presidential . candidate who lost to Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007. Satire: The French version of Spitting Image, Les Guignols, has predictably jumped in to poke fun at the love triangle . Telling off: Following Valerie Trierweiler's (pictured right) Twitter comments, Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said 'everyone should know their place' Valerie Trierweiler on stage after the results of the second round of the presidential election in Tulle, southwestern France . Ms Trierweiler continues: 'Yes, the . man I love had a woman before me. And she happened to be a presidential . election candidate. I have to live with it.' Ms Royal, like Mr Hollande a . passionate Socialist, always dreamed that they would make a golden . left-wing couple on the world stage, but instead it is Ms Trierweiler . who finds herself in the Elysee Palace. Ms Royal in fact lost yet another election when she stood in the primaries against Mr Hollande last year. Recalling the night when Mr Hollande . learnt he was victorious, Ms Trierweiler writes: 'As soon as we heard . the result, we went off on our own together for a few moments. 'He took me in his arms. Away from prying eyes. I cried. He laughed. Both of us were emotional.' There were even more dramatic scenes . back in 2011 when – on May 14 – Mr Holland and Ms Trierweiler learned . that Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the president of the International Monetary . Fund, was arrested in New York for allegedly trying to rape a chamber . maid. Glamour: Hollande initially painted himself as an antidote to the flash previous President Nicolas Sarkozy, who married model Carla Bruni . Mr Strauss-Kahn had been the hot . favorite to become Socialist president this year, but his humiliation in . America ended all hope of a successful political career, and opened the . door for Mr Hollande. Recalling the fateful night, Ms . Trierweiler said: 'I wake up Francoise up quickly. By way of answer he . whispers ""Go back to sleep, all this is bullshit"". I check the mail and I . insist that the news is already out.' The book is full of gushy praise for . the president the twice-divorced Ms Trierweiler calls 'my man'. She says . 'Francoise is always online when crisis requires' and that his election . campaign meant moments 'of solitude, moments of tension and of great . joy'. Ms Trierweiler has continued to write . for Paris Match since becoming First Lady and, in a review of a book . called Breaking the Charm this month, wrote: 'Every family lugs around . its share of dramas, secrets, and elephants in the room.' Despite her apparent confidence, Ms . Trierweiler is known to be upset that the four adult children of Mr . Hollande and Ms Royal have stopped speaking to her. She was initially defiant about the malicious tweet, but has now admitted to friends in Paris that she 'made a mistake'. Mr Hollande, meanwhile, was said to be  'furious' at what his new lover had done, telling her that 'it can never happen again'. In turn, Ms Royal said she was 'deeply wounded' by the 'violent blow' of Ms Trierweiler's tweet. If she had won La Rochelle, Mr . Hollande was set to appoint Ms Royal speaker of the National Assembly – . the third most important political position in France after President . and Prime Minister. Instead she has become increasingly . bitter, even accusing Ms Trierweiler of plotting against her ever since . she started a relationship with her ex-partner.

"Barbara Walters has weighed in on . disgraced Clippers owner Donald Sterling's health after his estranged . wife said that she thinks he has dementia. 'I won't use the word dementia- I'm not a doctor,' Walters said on Good Morning America today. 'I did find him very vague and confused by certain things so I could see that someone could get that impression.' Her opinion: Barbara Walters was meant to interview Sterling alongside his allege mistress but he stormed out . Change of plans: Donald Sterling was seen leaving the Four Season in Los Angeles when Walters' interview with Stiviano was happening on May 2 . Walters most recently interviewed Sterling's estranged wife Shelly, but she also previously met with Donald himself. More . than a week ago, the newswoman was set to interview both Donald . Sterling and his alleged mistress V. Stiviano, but only ended up . interviewing Stiviano. Reports surfaced later that Sterling did show up to the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles, but didn't go to the suite for the interview. There . were reports from onlookers in one of the elevators who said that . Sterling was screaming at Stiviano and calling her a 'media whore'. Sit down: Shelly Sterling (left) revealed that she plans to formally divorce her husband of more than 60 years . She'll split with her husband, but not the team: Shelley Sterling has admitted she plans to divorce husband Donald Sterling but will fight to keep her half of the team . For . Shelly's part, she drew on the fact that when she asked him about the . racist recording, her 81-year-old estranged husband didn't seem to . remember making the remarks. She . told Walters that when she asked Donald about the recordings, he said: . 'I don't remember saying that. I don't remember ever saying those . things.' 'I said, ""Well, this is the tape."" And he says, ""Hmm. I don't remember it."" That's when I thought he had dementia.' Sterling's health is not a new issue to be brought into the scandal, as it was earlier reported that he had prostate cancer, though Shelly Sterling did not talk about her estranged husband's health any further. Solo: Donald Sterling was scheduled to sit with V. Stiviano during her 20/20 interview but he allegedly yelled at her and stormed out before the cameras started rolling . When asked why they hadn't divorced in spite of the fact that they have been estranged for more than a year, she gave no clear answer, saying only that in spite of the fact that she  is 'very strong' normally, she was 'very weak' in her marriage. 'For . the last 20 years, I've been seeing attorneys for a divorce,' she told . Barbara Walters. 'In fact, I have here, I just filed, I was going to . file the petition. I signed the petition for a divorce.' Shelly Sterling says the decision to wait on making the request official was made by her financial advisor. Splitsville: Shelly Sterling (left) has admitted she will 'eventually' divorce disgraced husband Donald Sterling (right) 'Not now,' she recalled him saying before admitting that 'eventually I am going to [divorce him].' Her connection to her husband of more than 60 years is important at this time because she owns half of the basketball team and while her husband has been banned from the NBA. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has made it clear that he hopes to force Sterling to sell the team he has owned since 1981, but he has also indicated that he does not want Shelly to have an ownership role in his place. She plans to fight that vigorously, telling Walters that she wants to keep her half of the team. 'I will fight their decision,' she said. '(The team) means a lot (to me). I've been with the team for 33 years, through the good times and the bad times. And it's my passion and I love it and it's my legacy to my family.'","Barbara Walters interviewed Shelly Sterling over the weekend and the Clippers' owner's estranged wife said he has dementia .

"Horse-drawn carriage drivers are preparing for a fight after New York's mayor-elect Bill de Blasio said he wanted to outlaw the iconic rides when he takes office tomorrow. Mr de Blasio used his mayoral campaign to protest against the rides, saying it was not humane to have horses vying for space with traffic on the city's congested roads. But those who make a living out of ferrying visitors around the park say banning the carriages will damage tourism in the city. End of an era: Carriage rides through Central Park could be a thing of the past once Bill de Blasio takes office . At a press conference on Monday Mr de Blasio said ending the practice of horse-drawn rides, a $15 million a year industry in New York, was a priority. 'We are going to quickly and aggressively move to make horse carriages no longer a part of the landscape,' he said. 'They are not humane, they are not appropriate for the year 2014. It's over.' Many of the 200 or so people who make a living out of the carriage-ride industry have threatened to take legal action against Mr de Blasio and the city. 'You cannot just get rid of a business, a perfectly legal well-regulated … just because a few people don't like it,' Christina Hansen, a driver and spokeswomen for the industry, told the Daily News. 'If he wants to ban them because they're dangerous and inhumane, he needs to prove that.' Sid Kolo, of New York Central Park Tours, said the rides were part of New York history and had been going since the park opened more than 100 years ago. 'Inhumane': The mayor-elect has vowed to ban the tourist attraction, saying it is dangerous . Pledge: Bill de Blasio, due to be sworn in as New York Mayor on January 1, says banning carriage rides is a priority . 'People expect us to be here. It’s like taking away the Empire State Building. It’s the same as taking the [Christmas] tree from Rock Center,' he told NBC News. Animal activists however pointed out that everyone in the city traveled by horse-drawn carriage when Central Park was first opened. It wasn't until the 1940s that a New York mayor first issued permits for carriage rides as part of the tourist industry, according to the blog Carriage Horses NYC. Rights groups have also argued that the horses lead a dangerous life, vying for space on the city's congested roads with traffic, and being confined to small stalls at night. At least three horses have died in road accidents in the past seven years. Although the owners are required to give the horses five-week vacations out to pasture, many argue that isn't enough to protect their health. Tourists appeared divided by the . prospect of a ban. Some, such as Kathy and Keith Walker  said they had . booked their ride before leaving Washington on vacation. But others on sites such as TripAdvisor welcomed the ban and expressed concern for the future of the horses and their drivers. Future of travel: A model of the electric cars rights group NY Class has suggested tourists could ride in instead . Mr de Blasio, who has hired a legal team to work on the ban, wants to replace the horses with antique-looking electric cars. He said he would work with the carriage owners to make sure tourists still have a way to enjoy a ride around the park. The city council will have to approve any ban before it can take affect.","Mayor hires legal team to work on outlawing $15 million a year trade .

"The search for three objects that may be debris from missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370 will be long, complicated and fraught by the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean target area. That's the expert view of Chris Hadfield, the retired Canadian astronaut who spent months at the International Space Station monitoring the ocean from above, adding that variables in weather, wind and light may conspire against search teams in a 'very complex' mission. An exhaustive operation led by Australian authorities commenced Thursday to sweep a remote patch in the southern Indian Ocean after two large objects - one estimates to be 24 metres (78ft) long - were spotted by an American commercial satellite. Two objects spotted by an American satellite sparked an exhaustive sweep of the southern Indian Ocean Thursday, as Australian authorities describe the images as the 'best lead yet' in the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 . A third object has been spotted via Chinese satellite: This image provided by China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence shows a floating object seen in the Indian Ocean search zone . View from above: Commander Chris Hadfield says the vastness of the Indian Ocean alone, let alone the many variables that could affect the search, will make the operation very complex . A third object was spotted by Chinese satellite, it was announced Saturday, as the search entered its fourth day some 2,500 kilometres of the coast of Perth. But despite the optimism of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), the agency tasked with co-ordinating the search, and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Commander Hadfield this week warned the likelihood of locating the objects remained extremely slim. Commander Hadfield stressed the vastness of the search area and the ongoing challenge posed by unpredictable weather conditions, meant the southern search operation would be extremely difficult. 'The immensity of the sea is hard to express,' he told MSNBC. 'Even going as fast as the space station goes, at 5 miles a second, it's such a huge, untracked area. Vast, immense, untracked, huge: The Indian Ocean - even as seen from space - is almost too expansive to comprehend, according to Commander Hadfield . Commander Hadfield's time at the International Space Station gave him a unique perspective on ocean monitoring: 'If someone looks away or catches a wave the wrong way... trying to repeat a grid pattern to make sure they've truly exhausted everywhere they've looked - it's a really complex thing to do' 'I've been in the bottom of the space station with the biggest lens that we have, staring at the sea and taking pictures of the surface, and the vagaries of weather and wind and reflection off the water - even with those P3s and following airplanes searching the area - it's not nearly as simple as you'd like it to be. 'If someone looks away or catches a wave the wrong way... trying to repeat a grid pattern to make sure they've truly exhausted everywhere they've looked - it's a really complex thing to do.' The objects were spotted by the American satellite imaging firm DigitalGlobe, using a 2800-kilogram unit called the WorldView-2. It's capable of taking images every 1.1 days, Fairfax media reports, and can capture pictures at a resolution of 50 centimetres. The objects were spotted by the American satellite imaging firm DigitalGlobe, using a 2800-kilogram unit called the WorldView-2 . The southern Indian Ocean search zone, where an expanding fleet of  aircraft are searching for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, is a huge area complicated by many variables . Commander Hadfield acknowledged that while the lead was 'very promising', it may be a long shot to track the objects, which authorities stress may have already sunk well below the surface in a very deep stretch of the Indian Ocean. 'It's a very promising lead but not conclusive - it could be something that was swept off a ship,' he told NBC News. 'I think in fact, from satellites, is going to be our first bet and finding a debris field. 'It may very well be the way we find the wreckage of this plane, assuming that's what happened to it.' Helping to explain how a plane the size of the Boeing 777-200 could simply disappear, even with all the advanced technology available in 2014, Commander Hadfield told Mashable he wasn't shocked that it still hasn't been found. 'Just tracking one, thing aluminium tube (the plane) in a place that isn't heavily radar covered is really hard, virtually impossible,' he said. 'It is not a surprise to me at all how easy it is to make something that big disappear. The world is huge.'","MH370 search 'very complex' in a huge expanse of the Indian Ocean off the coast of Perth .

"Relatives of the passengers lost on board the missing Malaysian Airlines jet today slammed Malaysian authorities for keeping them in the dary over the search. Family members in Beijing accused the Malaysian delegation in China of 'concealing the truth' and 'making fools' out of the families after they left a meeting without answering questions. 'You can't leave here! We want to know what the reality is!' they shouted in frustration. 'Give us back our loved ones.' 'You can't leave here!' Angry relatives of passengers who were travelling on missing flight MH370 shout at a Malaysian delegation who walked out of a meeting without answering their questions about the search . Family members in Beijing accused the Malaysian delegation in China of 'concealing the truth' and 'making fools' out of them after they left a meeting without answering questions . The relatives subsequently released a statement saying they believe they have been 'strung along, kept in the dark and lied to by the Malaysian government.' 'This kind of conduct neglects the lives of all the passengers, shows contempt for all their families, and even more, tramples on the dignity of Chinese people and the Chinese government,' it said. The statement said the Malaysians had 'disregarded the life of the passengers', adding: 'They have been fooling the families and the people of the whole world.' More than two-thirds of those on board the missing Beijing-bound Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are Chinese. Many of the relatives have been holed up at the massive Lido Hotel in Beijing as they await further information. The protests and statement came earlier today, before the announcement by Chinese authorities of a second satellite sighting of what appeared to be a large chunk of debris floating in the southern Indian Ocean. Searches have been concentrated in that area since Australia announced three days ago that it had made a similar satellite sighting in the remote area 1,200 miles south-west of Perth. Wang Zhen, son of missing artist Wang . Linshi, said there were questions about why Malaysian authorities had . provided so much seemingly contradictory information. He . said he still has hopes his father can be found alive and is praying . that the satellite sightings turn out to be false. He and other . relatives are suspicious about what they are being told by the Malaysian . side, he added, but are at a loss as to what to do next. 'We . feel they're hiding something from us,' said Mr Wang, who is filling . his days attending briefings and watching the news for updates. A man shouts in protest, while a woman cries during the meeting: The relatives have released a statement saying they believe they have been 'strung along, kept in the dark and lied to by the Malaysian government' For a handful of Chinese families who chose to be flown to Kuala Lumpur to be closer to the heart of search operations, the flow of information has been no more fluid. On Wednesday, grief erupted into anger when several family members unfurled a protest banner in front of a throng of journalists, demanding the truth from the Malaysian government. The ruckus prompted police to escort the relatives, including a distraught mother, away from the briefing room. By yesterday, the Chinese families who had been staying at a resort south of Kuala Lumpur had to decamp to another hotel as they were displaced by customers for the upcoming Malaysian Formula One grand prix. 'Tonight all the government could give us was old information. But of course we, the families, want to hear new updates,' Malaysian Hamid Ramlat, the father of a passenger, told reporters after emerging from a briefing on Thursday night. The protest came before it was revealed that a large piece of floating debris has been spotted in the remote Indian Ocean search zone for missing flight MH370. Chinese satellites picked up signs of a 'suspicious' object measuring 72ft by 42ft in an area 75 miles west of where Australia reported an earlier sighting of floating debris.",Family members accuse Malaysian delegation of 'concealing the truth'
"A British hostage was killed by his captors in Nigeria yesterday when a UK Special Forces rescue operation ended in tragedy. Chris McManus was executed by gunmen as members of the Special Boat Service and Nigerian soldiers moved in on the Al Qaeda-inspired terrorists’ hideaway. Fellow hostage, Italian Franco Lamolinara, was also killed. The pair had been held for ten months. WATCH THE VIDEO BELOW . Captured: Chris McManus, left, and Franco Lamolinara, right, in the first video released by their kidnappers in Nigeria in August last year . British hostage: Christopher McManus was killed by his captors yesterday as . troops moved in to rescue him amid fears his life was in 'imminent and . growing danger' Fears for Mr McManus’s welfare had intensified following the release of a video in August showing the 28-year-old engineer blindfolded alongside three armed men. One of the terrorists said it would be the ‘last message’ to David Cameron about the hostage. Yesterday the Prime Minister broke the news of the execution to Mr McManus’s family in a personal phone call before making a public statement in which he appeared emotional. It is the second time he has ordered a hostage rescue mission that has failed. Scottish aid worker Linda Norgrove died when Special Forces tried to rescue her from the Taliban in Afghanistan. Mr Cameron had also telephoned his Italian counterpart Mario Monti to tell him of the failed operation – but last night there was growing anger in Italy as it became clear that Rome was informed of the raid to free the hostages only once it had got underway. Video plea: Mr McManus is seen pleading for his life as his armed captors stand behind him in the second video to be released by his kidnappers in December . Blindfolded: Mr McManus has a thick black blindfold placed over his eyes throughout the duration of the video . Further details of the rescue bid were emerging last night, but it remained unknown whether Mr McManus and Mr Lamolinara – a 48-year-old father of two – died before or during the operation. There were reports the men may have been held in a house in Sokoto, a city in Nigeria’s north-west. One witness said: ‘The security agencies tried to break into the house but there was resistance. The people inside the house were shooting at them and they returned fire.’ None of the 20 strong British rescue force was injured and Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan said all the terrorists had been arrested. The rescue was triggered when – after months of searching – the SBS found the heavily protected location where the men were being held. Mr Cameron said authorities had decided to go ahead with the rescue after receiving ‘credible information about [the men’s] location’. ‘A window of opportunity arose to secure their release. We also had reason to believe that their lives were under imminent and growing danger,’ he insisted. The Prime Minister said it was ‘with great regret’ that he had to announce Mr McManus, from Oldham, and Mr Lamolinara had lost their lives in the subsequent operation. ‘I am very sorry that this ended so tragically,’ he stressed, adding: ‘Terrorism and appalling crimes such as these are a scourge on our world. No one should be in any doubt about our determination to fight and to defeat them.’ Mr McManus, a contract worker for an Italian construction company, was kidnapped by gunmen in May last year after they stormed his apartment in Birnin-Kebbi in the north-west of Nigeria. Mr Lamolinara, a 48-year-old father of two of Gattinara near Turin, was also taken. A German colleague escaped by scaling a wall despite being shot and injured. Last night Mr McManus’s parents, two brothers and sister issued a statement thanking all involved in the attempted rescue. It said: ‘We are of course devastated by the news of Chris’s death, which we received earlier today. Members of the Special Boat Service, pictured here on a training exercise, were sent in to the kidnappers' hideout to try and rescue the two hostages . ‘During this ordeal we have relied heavily on the support of our family and friends which has never waned and has enabled us to get through the most difficult of times. ‘We are also aware of the many people who were working to try and have Chris returned to our family, and his girlfriend. We would like to thank all of them for their efforts.’ The family said they were confident ‘everything that could be done was being done’ during their ten-month ordeal and sent their condolences to relatives of the other dead hostage.’ The kidnapped men had been working on building a bank in the city, the capital of the lawless Kebbi province. In August a Nigerian group calling itself ‘Al Qaeda in the land beyond the Sahel’ claimed responsibility for the kidnap and released the video showing Mr McManus, in a Manchester United shirt, with three men armed with Kalashnikov rifles and a machete. He pleaded for the British Government to answer the demands of the group to save his life. One of the kidnappers then said the British Government had failed to answer its demands and it was given two weeks to ‘take the correct decision’. Yesterday, security officials said they believed the kidnappers were from a splinter group of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which has links to Al Qaeda. Sources said Ministry of Defence officials approached Mr Cameron on Wednesday evening and made it clear they believed there was a ‘time-limited opportunity’ to mount an attempt to free the men. The Prime Minister took the decision to go ahead and then followed the operation ‘in real time’ yesterday morning. A meeting of the Government’s emergency committee Cobra was convened, but word came back that the two men had been killed by their captors. The Italian prime minister’s office said that it had been ‘constantly in touch with British authorities but that the operation had got underway with the Nigerians and British forces with Italy informed once it had begun’. Former Italian prime minister Massimo D’Alema said: ‘I want full light to be shed on why Italy was only informed once the operation had started.’ WATCH THE VIDEO .","British Chris McManus and Italian Franco Lamolinara were captured by kidnappers in May while working in northern Nigeria .

"On her bike: Emily Thornberry leaves home on Friday after quitting the Shadow Cabinet . A topical joke by Tory whip Greg Hands was repeated with glee in Westminster yesterday. He said: ‘When I saw the photo of Emily Thornberry’s house in Islington, I imagined she must have resigned over Miliband’s mansion tax, rather than a tweet.’ Call it a cheap shot, if you wish. But it was a good one. For few Labour frontbenchers embodied the poisonous mixture of hypocrisy and elitism at the heart of the Miliband machine quite so perfectly as Ms Thornberry. This wealthy barrister, who (as consort to the Radley and Oxford-educated judge Sir Christopher Nugee) is properly known as ‘Lady Nugee’, enjoys a rarefied existence beyond the wildest dreams of the working- class voters her party purports to represent. Home is a vast, four-storey Victorian townhouse in an exclusive North London crescent beloved of lawyers and bankers, where a similar property changed hands earlier this year for £2.9 million — £900,000 above the threshold for Labour’s planned ‘soak-the-rich’ mansion tax. She and Sir Christopher, a barrister at Wilberforce Chambers whose specialities included the lucrative — if controversial — field of off-shore trusts (which, among other things, help rich people avoid taxes), bought the property in 1993, two years after they married. They moved in during the same week as another great Islingtonian power couple, Tony and Cherie Blair. Near neighbours in the street include Margaret Hodge, the multi-millionairess Labour MP. Aside from raising three children, Thornberry, 54, has spent almost her entire time in the intervening 21 years navigating the moneyed, London-centric worlds of the Law and New Labour politics — a fact that helps to explain the extraordinary gaffe that led to her downfall. By sneering at White Van Man and his patriotism, she offered yet more evidence that, under Ed Miliband’s leadership, the current Labour party shamefully fails to connect with, or comprehend, its traditional supporters. One shocked Labour MP, Simon Danczuk, described Thornberry’s comments as ‘derogatory and dismissive’. Another parliamentary colleague added: ‘It’s a typical cock up from one of this Islington cabal, who are terrified of stepping out of London and actually meeting Labour voters.’ Scroll down for video . Symptomatic of the Miliband machine’s insufferable arrogance, after a swift apology, Thornberry gave an interview to The Guardian, absurdly claiming that it was her critics who owed an apology — for expressing ‘anti-Islington prejudice’. It was a characteristically shameless move from a woman who, from the start of her political career, has betrayed a remarkable willingness to defend the indefensible. Husband: Radley and Oxford-educated judge Sir Christopher Nugee . Back in 2005, for example, when Thornberry was seeking election for the first time in Islington South and Finsbury, it was revealed that she had decided to snub the many inner-city comprehensive schools near her home in order to send her children to Dame Alice Owen’s, a partially-selective state school. The school has some of the best GCSE results in the country — but is situated some 13 miles away from Islington, in leafy Potter’s Bar in Hertfordshire. ‘I celebrate her good sense as a parent and deplore her hypocrisy as a politician,’ commented Chris Woodhead, the former Chief Inspector of Schools. ‘When will those who espouse the virtues of comprehensive education apply the logic of their political message to their children?’ Thornberry responded, with a straight face, that there was nothing hypocritical about sending her offspring to Dame Alice Owen’s because the school had originally been founded on a site near to her home, before moving to Potter’s Bar in 1973. ‘In my opinion, it should never have left Islington,’ she said. Such a comment could have come straight out of the mouth of Harriet Harman (for the Labour deputy leader famously, and with breathtaking hypocrisy, sent her own children to the selective schools she wanted to abolish for everyone else). Two years later, it was revealed that despite having repeatedly campaigned for more social housing to be provided in her constituency, Thornberry had used a spare £572,000 to buy a property in Clerkenwell from a housing association. She was then letting the terraced home on the private market. ‘This is not property speculation,’ she said. ‘We are providing cheap and cheerful accommodation for some young people.’ Thornberry has also demonstrated, in her nine years in Parliament, an uncanny knack of creating controversy. In 2006, she was reported to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards by the leader of Islington Council for allegedly being involved in foul play by trying to raise her own profile on Electoral Commission literature. The Commissioner found her actions to be ‘unwise and unfortunate’ but not illegal. Tweet: Emily Thornberry mocks White Van Man with this 'sneering' post on the social media website . Two years later, she fell out with the Metropolitan Police after claiming that there were ‘hardly any children in Islington who have not been mugged at some stage’. The Met pointed out, a mere 750 children (out of a population of 170,000) had been mugged in the borough the previous year. In interviews, Thornberry, who often travels by bicycle, has repeatedly sought to deflect criticisms of the more controversial aspects of her gilded lifestyle by waxing lyrical about her supposedly-humble background. ‘My family, that I was brought up in, was fatherless and . . . my mother was on benefits and we lived in the council estate,’ she said on BBC1’s Question Time in 2012. London base: Ms Thornberry's home in Islington (plus flag), now worth roughly £2.9million . That’s true, but only up to a point. Thornberry was born and raised in prosperous Surrey. Her father, Cedric, was a renowned lawyer who became United Nations Assistant Secretary General. Her mother, Sallie, was a teacher and Labour activist who served as a councillor and later mayor of Guildford, where Emily now keeps a second rental property. At the age of seven, her parents divorced. She and her two younger brothers did, indeed, move into social housing with their mother. The exact circumstances of the marital split remain unknown. Indeed, mention of her father is omitted from Thornberry’s Who’s Who entry, though he lived at her Islington address for a time in the Nineties. Having failed the 11-plus, Thornberry prospered at a Secondary Modern, going to the University of Kent, in Canterbury. She was called to the Bar in 1983, and in 1985 joined Tooks Chambers, where she worked in human rights law under the Left-wing celebrity barrister Michael Mansfield (whose cases have included Bloody Sunday and the Birmingham Six). It was through work that she met her barrister husband, a second generation old boy of Radley College, the exclusive £33,000-a-year public school. (His father was a deputy High Court judge for 15 years.) Christopher’s profile on the website of Wilberforce Chambers lists among his specialities ‘offshore trusts’ and ‘property law’. They have two sons – aged 22 and 15 – and a 21-year-old daughter. Inspired by her mother, Thornberry stood for election as Labour MP in Islington in 2005, having been parachuted into former Cabinet minister Chris Smith’s safe seat via an all-woman shortlist. She did not go down well with voters, turning Smith’s 7,000 majority into one of just 484, but in Westminster, her rise was rapid. A close friend – and kindred spirit – of fellow North Londoner Ed Miliband, she was made his parliamentary aide when he served as Energy Secretary in the last Labour government. After the 2010 election, she was reportedly the first MP to encourage him to challenge his brother David for leadership. Rented out: The MP owns a £600,000 flat in Guildford, Surrey, above, which she bought in 2000 . Following his victory, she was duly given jobs on the shadow Environment and care teams, before becoming Shadow Attorney General — a role in which she was regarded as one of his greatest loyalists. Says one Westminster insider: ‘She was always happy to go on TV and radio to defend Ed.’ Loyalty, it seems, was a one-way street. Miliband acted swiftly to save his own skin on Thursday night and to force her resignation. The last thing the beleaguered ‘old-style Hampstead socialist’ needed was a blundering ‘Islington Champagne Socialist’ to demonstrate how utterly out of touch his party is with so many British people. Empire: In 2007, the couple purchased a Housing Association property in Clerkenwell at auction for £572,000, pictured above . Emily Thornberry was facing pressure last night over her controversial property holdings. The MP and her QC husband, Sir Christopher Nugee, live in an imposing Islington townhouse which they bought in 1993 and is now worth roughly £2.9million. At one time, Cherie and Tony Blair were their neighbours on the exclusive crescent, where yesterday a prankster had fixed an England flag to Miss Thornberry’s railings. In 2007, the couple purchased a Housing Association property in Clerkenwell at auction for £572,000 – even though Miss Thornberry had often called on Islington Council to build more homes and cut housing waiting lists. The property is said to be worth at least £1.2million. She also owns a £600,000 flat in Guildford, Surrey, which she says she bought for her mother in 2000 to ‘free’ her council house for a family. It is rented out, and while she has refused to reveal her income from the property, another flat in the building has a ‘rental value’ of £3,000 a month. The flat is overseen by a company called Clifton House (Guildford) Limited, incorporated in 2004. Land Registry documents reveal a number of leases linked to other flats in the building. When questioned yesterday, the MP said she knew ‘nothing’ about the firm. But company documents reveal that she was appointed a director on April 9, 2008 – the month that her mother died. She resigned on April 1, 2010 – and was replaced by her husband. From 2007 to October 2010, her parliamentary register of interests revealed that she had a ‘one-fifth interest in a flat in South London’. This is not in her current register of interests, suggesting that the property has been sold.

"A mother has praised surgeons who performed open-heart surgery on her when she was pregnant, saving the life of both her and her unborn baby. Rachael Prince, 27, conceived without knowing she was on the brink of heart failure. Medics were shocked that she was still alive when a scan four months into her pregnancy showed she was at immediate risk of sudden death. Rachael Prince, 27, had to have open heart surgery while she was pregnant with Jack, now one . In fact, it was only because she had been taking it easy since become pregnant that she was still alive as any exercise or exertion would have caused her heart to fail killing her and her baby. Doctors told Mrs Prince, her only chance of survival was open-heart surgery to replace her heart valve. Delaying the operation until after delivery was not an option as both mother and baby could die. But performing open-heart surgery on a pregnant woman was so risky that Mrs Prince was offered the option of terminating her pregnancy before the operation. She refused but was warned that if she continued with the pregnancy there was a high chance she would miscarry or her baby would suffer brain damage. But to her sheer delight, five months after the open-heart surgery Jack was born fit and well and has now turned one with a clean bill of health. When she was four months pregnant, Mrs Prince was told that she was in danger of sudden death because her heart was on the brink of failing and she needed a valve replaced . Mrs Prince was told she needed six hours of open-heart surgery and the risk to Jack was so great that she was offered a termination before the operation. She was told that he might die or suffer brain damage . Mrs Prince, from the Isle of Man, said: ‘I feel like the luckiest mum alive. To both survive feels like a miracle. I can’t praise the surgeons enough. They were amazing. ‘I was terrified about losing my baby but without the surgery we both would have died anyway. We’ve been through so much together.’ Her terrifying ordeal started when the insurance broker found out she was expecting a baby with her husband, William, in March 2012. Mrs Prince had been born with a condition called aortic stenosis - tightening of the aortic valve. She had undergone heart surgery as a baby and the condition was thought to be under control. But when she learned she was expecting, she immediately contacted her GP who arranged a scan. Mrs Prince refused to have an abortion and, amazingly, Jack was born completely healthy a few months later . Initial tests did not raise concerns and her pregnancy progressed well until the four month mark when medics arranged for a more in depth echo scan at St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester. Mrs Prince explains: ‘I felt glowing, absolutely fine, so when I sat down with the cardiologist after the scan I was smiling because I was sure everything was perfect.’ But things were far from well and Mrs Prince was told in no uncertain terms she was not leaving hospital. She said: ‘The consultant basically said I was at immediate risk of sudden death. I was not leaving the hospital. ‘I couldn’t believe it because I felt great. I burst into tears of shock.’ Mrs Prince was admitted immediately and told she would need surgery the following day. The heart valve needed replacing but . because of the serious risk that posed to her unborn baby’s life, medics . hoped to be able to stretch it – delaying surgery until after the . birth. Mrs Prince said: 'I feel like the luckiest mum alive. To both survive feels like a miracle. I can't praise the surgeons enough. They were amazing' But it was not successful. It meant her only chance of survival was dangerous open-heart surgery to replace the valve using a heart bypass machine. The risk to her unborn child was so severe that Mrs Prince was offered a termination. She refused, but was warned it meant her baby had a one in three chance of death during the operation. If he did survive there was a one in three chance of brain damage. Mrs Prince said: ‘The odds were awful but I had to believe we’d been lucky so far for a reason, and that we would both be ok.’ Two days before the operation she found out she was having a boy. She said: ‘In one way it made it harder but in another way I felt stronger because I knew.’ Mrs Prince was wheeled into theatre for the six-hour operation on May 30, 2012. Jack (pictured shortly after his birth) has been given a clean bill of health despite being put at risk of brain damage during the operation . She said: ‘My thoughts were for my baby but my family were also worried sick about me. I had been told there was still a one in 20 chance that I might die.’ After the operation she was relieved to hear her baby was still alive – but faced an anxious wait to know if he’d suffered brain damage. She spent a further six weeks in hospital for both her and baby to be closely monitored for any signs of distress. Finally on June 10 she was discharged. ‘It was lovely to go home but we still had a shadow hanging over us. Nobody knew if our baby had been brain damaged,' she added.

Prince said: ‘There were no obvious signs of brain damage on the scan . but we were told we wouldn’t really know until he was born.’ Mrs Prince said: 'The relief [when he was born] was indescribable. To know he was finally safe was amazing' Doctors arranged her labour to be induced at 37 weeks so she could give birth with a heart surgeon on standby just in case. Finally, Jack was delivered on October 19, 2012 weighing 7lb 3oz and placed in his mother’s arms. She said: ‘The relief was indescribable. To hold him and know he was finally safe was amazing. I didn’t care at that point if he was brain damaged or not. He was alive.’ Thankfully, regular checks have shown Jack is meeting all his milestones and he celebrated his first birthday with a clean bill of health. Mrs Prince’s consultant, Dr Sarah Vause, said: ‘When Rachael attended the clinic she had an echo scan of her heart and we realised that the problem with the aortic valve was much more severe that had previously been thought and she was at sudden risk of death. ‘Rachael has proved inspirational to many women who have been having serious heart problems in pregnancy. ‘She’s a truly amazing woman and mother.’","Rachael Prince had a heart condition but it was thought to be under control .

"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan will announce a £5million fund to help state schools offer debating competitions, sports coaching, theatre productions and musical instrument tuition . All schools should ensure children are given character-building activities as well as a core academic curriculum, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan will say today. She will announce a £5million fund to help state schools offer debating competitions, sports coaching, theatre productions and musical instrument tuition. The scheme is intended to help equip state school pupils with the values and character traits needed to succeed in the workplace and compete with youngsters educated at private schools. Mrs Morgan wants to build on reforms to the school curriculum to ensure that youngsters also receive a broad education and develop wider skills. Schools will be encouraged to offer debating, sport, drama and other clubs at lunchtimes and after-school to instil attributes such as resilience, perseverance and the ability to work in teams. The Coalition is already encouraging schools to consider offering longer days to allow pupils to take part in extra-curricular activities and complete homework under supervision. Mrs Morgan will today host a roundtable event with key figures from business and charities to discuss how schools can develop a child’s character. She will also hold up examples of state schools already excelling in character education. They include Outwood Academy Portland, in Worksop, Notts, which offers more than 100 after-school classes ranging from extra English and maths to an orchestra, choir and debating club. In a dramatic turnaround, the school has won an ‘outstanding’ Ofsted rating having been among the worst in the country just over two years ago. Principal Dr Phillip Smith says the introduction of a broad range of extra-curricular activities has been instrumental in the school’s success. Meanwhile School 21, a free school in Newham, east London, has identified 21 qualities as attributes of a successful student and provides leadership and debating classes to enhance pupil’s assertiveness and public speaking skills. With a tough new curriculum being implemented in schools this academic year, Mrs Morgan now wants to emphasise the role schools can play in equipping pupils with broader skills and attributes. Announcing the £5million fund, Mrs Morgan said: ‘Our plan for education is to ensure all young people leave school prepared for life in modern Britain. That means not only ensuring that young people learn core academic skills and knowledge, but also that they develop the values and attributes to succeed in employment, further study and later life. ‘That’s why I want all children to experience the type of activities which develop character and resilience, both in and beyond the classroom. ‘Whether it is the teamwork and resilience that come from playing sport, the dedication and perseverance it takes to learn an instrument or the confidence and self-expression which they may find on the stage, the fund will mean every child has the opportunity to receive a broad and balanced education.’ Mrs Morgan's predecessor Michael Gove said he wanted debating, orchestra and drama clubs to be for state as well as private schools in a speech earlier this year . The fund will be mainly targeted at schools in disadvantaged areas. It will also cover career and mentoring schemes, which are said to help prepare children for the transition into adult life. Mrs Morgan’s predecessor Michael Gove had already outlined an aspiration to raise standards in state schools to the point where they are indistinguishable from private schools, including the range of extra-curricular activities on offer. In a speech earlier this year, Mr Gove said: ‘I want to see state schools in England the best in the world. 'State schools where the vast majority of pupils have the grades and the skills to apply to university, if they want to; where a state pupil being accepted to Oxbridge is not a cause for celebration, but a matter of course; where it is the norm for state pupils to enjoy brilliant extra-curricular activities like sports, orchestras, cadets, choir, drama, debating, the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, and more. ‘All those things are par for the course in the private sector – why shouldn’t children in the state sector enjoy them?’ A subsequent report from a cross-party parliamentary group insisted that Britain’s schools must be ‘more than just exam factories’. It argued that schools should make it part of their ‘core business’ to nurture pupils’ self-belief, perseverance and ability to bounce back from set-backs. Among the guests at today’s roundtable is Baroness Sue Campbell, chair of the Youth Sport Trust, who said: ‘I am a firm believer that Physical Education and school sport, when taught and delivered well, can help young people develop greater resilience. ‘At the Youth Sport Trust, we use the power of sport to develop young people’s confidence and self-esteem which are critically important to success - academically, in employment and throughout life. ‘I hope the discussion today recognises the importance of PE and sport in developing these skills.’","Education Secretary Nicky Morgan will announce the scheme today .

"If you like a strong cup of black coffee, your dentist has probably told you it is doing your teeth no favours. But new research suggests that drunk in moderation, coffee can actually stop tooth decay. Brazilian scientists have found that a certain type of coffee bean has an anti-bacterial property. If it is drunk strong, black, without sugar, and in moderation, it could help keep teeth health. Strong, black coffee drunk in moderation can actually help stop tooth decay, research shows. Scientists from Rio de Janerio's Federal University tested extracted baby teeth with extract from Coffea canephora . Scientists at Rio de Janeiro’s Federal University tested extracted baby teeth with an extract from Coffea canephora, a type of bean that makes up 30 per cent of the world’s coffee. They found that the coffee actively broke down bacterial biofilms which cause dental plaques, a major cause of tooth decay. Lead researcher Andréa Antonio said: ‘Dental plaque is a classic complex biofilm and it’s the main culprit in tooth decay and gum disease. ‘We are always looking for natural compounds – food and drink, even – that can have a positive impact on dental health.’ Using milk teeth, donated by children, the team cultivated biofilms on tooth fragments using the bacteria in saliva samples. When the fragments were exposed in solution to an extract of coffee beans, the bacteria were broken down. The researchers think that polyphenol . antioxidants in the coffee were probably responsible for the effect, but . said more research is needed to establish a direct link. Professor . Antonio, whose paper is published today in the journal Letters in . Applied Microbiology, warned that too much coffee can still be bad for . teeth. The researcher said: . ‘Whilst this is an exciting result, we have to be careful to add that . there are problems associated with excessive coffee consumption, . including staining and the effects of acidity on tooth enamel. The bean is used in 30 per cent of the world's coffee. It was found to break down bacterial bio films which cause dental plaques - a cause of tooth decay . ‘And if you take a lot of sugar and cream in your coffee, any positive effects on dental health are probably going to be cancelled out.’ Eventually, the active chemicals could be extracted from coffee to be used in a mouthwash or toothpaste. Separate research has found that a similar effect could be found in hop leaves used to make beer. Scientists at Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences found the leaves contain polyphenols which can prevent the release of bacterial toxins in the mouth. Yoshihisa Tanaka, writing in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, said: ‘Every year, farmers harvest about 2,300 tons of hops in the United States, but the bracts are not used for making beer and are discarded. ‘Thus, there is potentially a large amount of bracts that could be repurposed for dental applications.’","Black coffee drunk in moderation can stop tooth decay, study shows .

"Thiago Silva wants Brazil to win the World Cup for Neymar - and he is confident they can do so. There was a flat feeling around Fortaleza late on Friday night as the extent of Neymar's injury began to filter through to the locals. The Brazilian Football Confederation had confirmed Neymar would miss the rest of the World Cup because of a fractured veterbra he suffered after being kneed in the back by Juan Zuniga. VIDEO . Leading the way: Thiago Silva celebrates giving Brazil the lead . On the run: Thiago beats Adrian Ramos to the ball . Their best player may be out of the World Cup, but Silva insists Brazil's dreams of lifting the trophy on home soil for the first time remain very much alive. The Brazil captain was saddened to hear of Neymar's injury, but after the match he was buoyant about his team's chances of lifting the trophy on July 13 in the Maracana.'We have proposed to win the World Cup for Neymar because of the injury he suffered,' the Paris Saint-German defender said. 'This moment could mark the start of a revolution for us. 'He hopes and expects a lot from this group, and this could unite us, it could give us more determination to win.' Crunch: Juan Camilo Zuniga clashes with Neymar . Agony: Neymar clutches his back after going down injured during Brazil's win over Colombia on Friday . Neymar may be 22-years-old but he has dragged Brazil through this tournament so far. The Barcelona forward's pace, trickery and eye for goal make him a nightmare to defend against. The former Santos man is Brazil's top scorer here, with four goals, and he also scored the crucial penalty to knock Chile out in the previous round. Bernard, a diminutive 21-year-old from Shakhtar Donetsk, and Chelsea's Willian, who played for the Ukrainians until last summer, are not in the same class as Neymar, but Silva is sure they could do a good job if called upon to face Germany in the semi-finals. Carried away: Neymar was stretchered off the pitch and taken to hospital after Brazil's quarter-final win . 'Neymar is very important for us. We depend a lot on him and he makes the difference in our group,' said Silva, who put Brazil ahead with an early strike. 'But in the place of Neymar, we can play either Willian or Bernard, who have similar characteristics. 'This is the moment to show the strength of the squad.' Zuniga apologised to Neymar after the final whistle and Silva, who used to play for AC Milan, insisted the Napoli defender did not mean to harm the forward. 'Zuniga does not have any nastiness in him. I know him from Serie A,' he said Silva. 'What he did, I think, was rash. I still have not seen the pictures, but I know that in these circumstances it was difficult to get the ball off Neymar. 'He was dominating. I am a centre-back, and I know that in situations like this one should be looked at more thoroughly.' The whole game as an ill-disciplined affair. Referee Carlos Velasco Carballo failed to maintain discipline in a full-blooded encounter at the Estadio Castelao. A total of 54 fouls were committed, one of which came when Silva pulled back Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina. That foul meant the 29-year-old will miss Tuesday's semi-final against Germany in Belo Horizonte. Colombia, meanwhile, head home wondering what might have been.Jose Pekerman's side looked down and out when David Luiz scored a stunning free-kick to put Brazil 2-0 up, but James Rodriguez converted an 80th minute penalty to cue a nervous finale. Horror: X-rays confirmed Neymar suffered a clean break in his back . Rodriguez has been just as key to Colombia as Neymar has been to Brazil at this tournament. The 22-year-old Monaco forward has scored six goals at his first World Cup, but that mattered little to him after Friday's defeat. 'We are really sad because we wanted to progress, we wanted to make history tonight,' Rodriguez said.

"A girl of seven has been saved by a kidney transplant from her 60-year-old grandmother – the biggest ever age gap for a donation in the UK. Eva Dowling was diagnosed with a rare and life-threatening illness at three months old. Her condition, atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome, causes clots to  block blood vessels and can lead to  kidney failure. Unable to eat or drink and needing frequent blood transfusions, Eva had to be fed through a tube in her stomach and spent three days a week in hospital. Eva Dowling, seven, has undergone a life-saving kidney transplant, thanks to her grandmother Eileen Smith-Jones, 60, in what experts believe is the biggest age gap between donor and recipient in the country . Doctors feared she would never be able . to have a kidney transplant because of the blood transfusions, which . drastically increased the chance her body would reject a donated organ. But when her grandmother Eileen Smith-Jones was found to be a perfect . match, Eva’s life was transformed. ‘I . can survive quite nicely with one kidney and the difference in Eva is . incredible,’ Mrs Smith-Jones said.  ‘She is livelier, happier and able . to  do things she has never done before. We are so happy.’ Now . Eva, who calls her new kidney ‘Miss Kitty’, can enjoy her food and says . she loves chocolate and porridge. She needs a check up just once a . fortnight, meaning she can attend school full-time for the first time. Eva can eat, drink, swim and go to school full-time for the first time in her life after the life-saving operation at Bristol Children's Hospital, pictured. She was diagnosed with the rare and life-threatening kidney disease atypical HUS when she was just three months old . Mrs . Smith-Jones has also recovered well after the operation. ‘Unfortunately . giving a kidney didn’t make me any lighter,’ she said. ‘But my cravings . for chocolate and red wine  have gone.’ Eva’s mother Nicola Dowling, 34, said: ‘How can you ever thank someone for what she did? ‘It has made the world of  difference to Eva and the whole family. She can now live a  normal life.’ A . spokesman for the Human Tissue Authority said an age gap of this size . between donor and recipient was very rare. There are only a few cases of . grandparents donating to their grandchildren each year . Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is a very rare, life-threatening, progressive disease. The disease, which affects both children and adults, causes the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body. The clots pose a danger, potentially causing stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and death. Between . 33 and 40 per cent of patients diagnosed with the condition will . develop end-stage renal disease, leading to permanent renal damage. Those suffering atypical HUS will suffer recurring bouts of the disease throughout their lives. The syndrome is not well understood, but it thought to be linked to an irregularity in several genes. However in some cases the disease can appear out of nowhere. In the U.S. the number of cases of Atypical HUS is thought to be around 300 a year. In . most cases a patient with atypical HUS will suffer fatigue, become . irritable and lethargic to a point where they need to be admitted to . hospital. There are three . main causes of atypical HUS, pregnancy induced cases of the disease are . the most common external source, while some cancers, HIV and other rare . pneumonia diseases are also known triggers. A second major cause is familial or genetic cases. There is no standard treatment, because each case differs. Children with the disease often develop various complications, so treatment is tailored.

"Patients tried to flee a London hospital screaming 'Ebola' when medics wearing biohazard suits brought in an elderly woman for emergency treatment. Patients at University Hospital Lewisham evacuated the casualty unit, as the woman was kept outside in an ambulance. She was kept in the ambulance for an hour before finally being taken by  crew in protective clothing for tests, it has been reported. University Hospital Lewisham descended into panic when medics wearing biohazard suits brought in an elderly woman for emergency treatment and a fellow patient shouted 'Ebola' A witness told The Sun: ‘There was panic. Luckily, there was a glass wall between us and the potential victim’. There around 40 people in the A&E department when the ambulance arrived, the witness added. The woman was later deemed 'low risk' and sent home to await results from her tests. A hospital spokesman said: 'Whilst we cannot discuss individual cases, we can say that we have not had any confirmed cases of Ebola at Lewisham Hospital. 'Like many other London hospitals we expect to see a number of patients with a history of travel to West Africa who need precautionary testing for Ebola under current public health guidance. In most cases, Ebola is considered very unlikely but testing is done as a precaution.' Earlier this month it was reported that a man arrived at the hospital fearing he had the deadly virus after travelling to Britain from Sierra Leone. It was claimed that some staff refused to go near the man, who was reportedly allowed visitors and used a communal toilet. The man - who was later found not to have the virus - was not transferred to the specialist Royal Free Hospital, which is the only hospital in Britain equipped with a fully 'ebola-proof' isolation unit. Patients then tried to flee the casualty unit, as the woman was kept outside in an ambulance.She was kept in the ambulance for an hour before finally being taken by ambulance crew in protective clothing for tests . The woman was brought in by ambulance staff wearing biohazard suits (stock picture) as a suspected Ebola case. But she was later deemed 'low risk' According to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus has killed more than 4,500 people since first appearing deep in the Guinean forest last December. Yesterday, a further 135 British Army medics left Britain for Ebola-stricken Sierra Leone. The doctors, nurses and consultants from the Royal Army Medical Corps will train West African health care workers who will man  five Ebola Treatment Units the UK is currently building - but will not treat the public. International Development Secretary Justine Greening also boarded the flight from RAF Brize Norton to Sierra Leone to help with the fight against Ebola. The Cabinet minister says Britain is leading the international response to the disease in the country, and has pledged a £125 million aid package including support for 700 treatment beds. It comes as Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned European leaders to urgently  stump up extra money to fight the Ebola crisis - as figures revealed the founders of Facebook and Microsoft alone had given almost as much as France. Mr Hammond, in Luxembourg for a crisis summit on the epidemic sweeping West Africa, said world leaders had ‘a short window’ to beat the disease. European Union governments are working to raise £800 million in aid by the end of the week to fight the deadly virus - with Britain and the US having so far picked up the bulk of the costs of fighting the outbreak.","Medics wearing protective clothing arrived with elderly patient .

Barcelona (4-3-3): Ter Stegen; Alves, Pique (Samper 75), Alba (Correira 60), Bartra; Mascherano, Rakitic, Roberto; Messi, Suárez, Neymar (Adriano 66). Subs not used: Masip Montoya, Munir, Iniesta. Scorers: Neymar (x2), Messi, Suarez, Alba. Elche (5-4-1): Tyton; Cisma (Fragapane 72), Lomban, Suarez, Albacar, Pelegrin; Roco, Fajr, Pasalic, Coro (Jonathas 57); Herrera (Niguez 63). Subs not used: Adrian, Rodriguez, Freixanet, Galvez. Booked: Suarez, Roco, Pelegrin. Referee: David Fernandez . Att: 27,099 . Suarez looked especially inspired, assisting the first and scoring the second, meaning he now has goals in all three competitions for the club he joined this summer. Barcelona were both unlucky and wasteful in the first half hour. Neymar should have been awarded a penalty when he was bounced off the ball by Damian Suarez but the referee waved away the appeals. Then a perfect lofted pass from Messi dropped into Neymar's path. The Brazilian should have scored without breaking stride but he sent his shot wide. Neymar was all flicks and tricks against Elche's five-man defence and on 35 minutes he was given another chance and this time he didn't miss, hammering home Suarez's slide-rule pass across the face of the six-yard box. Suarez could have opened his account on 38 minutes but his lob was finger-tipped away by Elche keeper Przemysław Tyton. The former Liverpool striker was working hard though and he created an opening for himself just before half-time before drilling home the Barca second. Neymar was then tripped on the stroke of half-time and Messi scored the penalty, before blowing a kiss to supporters who were making it clear who they backed in the power struggle between coach and star player. Suarez was involved again 10 minutes into the second half, passing to Messi who threaded a pass through Elche's defence to Jordi Alba, who made it 4-0. And it was five when Neymar rifled in right-footed from the edge of the area. The Brazilian was kicked by Damian Suarez and taken off as a precaution but it's a measure of  Enrique's popularity-low at the moment that his decision to bring on Adriano was booed by many fans. Adriano was put through by Suarez and should really have played the return pass but went for the lob instead and was wide with his finish. Suarez did little to hide his disgust. He at least had his fourth goal in a Barca shirt and the team had reminded everyone what they are capable of. Neymar scored his second, and Barcelona's fifth, goal shortly before the hour mark at the Nou Camp on Thursday evening .

"The White House upped the ante Friday on the terrorist Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), declaring that the videotaped beheading of American photojournalist James Foley is 'a terrorist attack' – an admission that brought a stern ultimatum from a senior Republican in Congress. 'When you see somebody killed in such a horrific way, that represents a terrorist attack,' Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters during a briefing on Martha's Vineyard. 'That represents a terrorist attack against our country and against an American citizen.' Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, the Republican who chairs the powerful House Intelligence Committee, told MailOnline after the briefing that it's time for President Barack Obama to get serious about eradicating ISIS – which half the American government refers to as ISIL – instead of merely keeping the group at bay. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'A terrorist attack': White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes used the 'T' word on Friday describing the videotaped beheading of an American news photographer . 'The president should make clear that ISIL will soon experience the full capabilities of American might': House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers has thrown down the gauntlet, but will Obama pick it up? 'Containment is not an option,' Rogers said. 'We need to build a coalition and use American military might. The administration has now acknowledged what many have long known: ISIL is an undeniable threat to the peace and security of the United States.' 'We should not assume, however, that brutal groups like ISIL fail on their own. They fail when stronger forces decide to take aggressive and prolonged action in response to their menacing actions.' 'The president should make clear,' Rogers concluded, 'that ISIL will soon experience the full capabilities of American might. And I urge the president to develop a coherent strategy to defeat this enemy, and quickly authorize all necessary actions to do so.' The perception of slow-willed inaction is dogging the White House, enabled by the White House's insistence that Iraq's turmoil will require a political solution – not a military one. A Pentagon spokesman hinted on Friday that America's military involvement in Iraq wouldn't be of the long-term shock-and-awe variety. 'What we are doing in there is in support of Iraq,' Rear Admiral John Kirby told reporters during a press briefing. 'And ultimately this is a fight that the Iraqi security forces have got to take on.' The answer to the ISIS crisis, he said, 'is going to be found in good governance.' 'Now I know that's not – you know, that doesn't offer everybody the immediacy that they might want to have with dealing with this threat, this very serious threat,' Kirby added. 'But ultimately it's defeating the ideology through good governance. It's removing the unstable conditions, the petri dish, through which groups like this can foster and grow.' Rhodes seemed to go further a half-hour later. 'If we see [ISIS] lotting against Americans, [if] we see a threat to the United States emanating from anywhere, we stand ready to take action against that threat,' he said. The fast-flying contradictions between the Pentagon and the White House are dizzying to some observers, particularly those who want to see a devastating U.S. response to the vicious killing of American photojournalist James Foley. 'Nero fiddles while Rome burns,' insisted retired Marine Lt. Col. Bill Cowan during a Fox News interview Thursday night. 'I think this president could care less about all the threats we face.' 'He's probably gliding along on a path where he hopes nothing will happen to the United States in the next two years while he's still the president. But the reality is ... we face a threat unlike any threat we've ever faced in our lives, and this administration seems to be doing nothing about it.' 'Dropping some bombs here and there is nice,' he snarked. 'Nero fiddles while Rome burns,' said retired Marine Lt. Col. Bill Cowan; 'I think this president could care less about all the threats we face' Confusion: The Pentagon's chief spokesman said Friday that the U.S. military wants permission to 'train and equip' Syria's rebel groups, at the same time the dictatorship is assuming greater importance as a potential ally in the fight against ISIS . As ISIS continued to conquer and hold territory, American military strategists are sharpening their focus on the portion of the group's fighters who remain on the Syrian side of a largely invisible border with Iraq. Launching a decisive attack on the group in northern Iraq, they fear, will only serve to isolate ISIS in Syria, where dictator Bashar al-Assad's regime would likely keep them out of America's reach. For that reason, the Pentagon has begun to talk openly about the need to neutralize Assad in order to take him out of the equation, leaving the U.S. free to finish the job with ISIS. 'We do not have the authorities now to begin a train-and-equip program with the moderate Syrian opposition,'  Kirby explained Friday, referring to the hodgepodge of Islamists and less ideological factions who have opposed the Syrian strongman since the spring of 2011. 'We want to have those authorities and we want to have the resources that go with it,' he said. 'We're still working on that right now,' he added. The U.S. has not – officially, at least – provided arms to those groups since many in Congress have fretted about the possibility of military materiel ultimately aiding terrorist organizations. American arms and armored vehicles have already fallen into ISIS's hands as the group seizes hardware originally gifted to the Iraqi army. Amid the cacophony, another approach to Assad has emerged: Some are now arguing that America should let bygones be bygones and ask him for permission to conduct anti-ISIS airstrikes in his country. General Lord Dannatt, the former Chief of General Staff of the UK's army, said during a radio interview Friday that 'the Syrian dimension has got to be addressed. You cannot deal with half a problem.' 'The old saying ""my enemy's enemy is my friend"" has begun to have some resonance with our relationship with Iran,' he said. 'I think it's going to have to have some resonance with our relationship with Assad.' 'Whether it is above the counter or below the counter, a conversation has got to be held with him. Because if there are going to be any question of air strikes over Syria airspace it's got to be with the Assad regime's approval.' 'The enemy of our enemy is our friend': Geraldo Rivera wants to 'rehabilitate' Bashar al-Assad so the dictator can help the US defeat ISIS in Syria . General Lord Dannatt, the former Chief of General Staff of the UK's army, said during a radio interview that the West should soften on working with Assad the way it has soften previously in Iraq . UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond retorted almost immediately that Britain won't 'align' with Assad to defeat ISIS. His country may have a 'common enemy' with the Syrian regime, Hammond said, but 'that doesn't make us friends. It doesn't make us able to trust them, it doesn't enable use to work with them.' Television commentator Geraldo Rivera told aFox News Channel audience Friday morning that while he wants 'to see a declaration of war against ISIS,' the U.S. should aim for 'the rehabilitation of the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad and his Shiite forces who have successfully kept them at bay.' 'The enemy of our enemy is our friend,' Rivera said, echoing Dannatt. 'I want us to rehabilitate the dictator in Damascus. I think he can be forced to make his own government more inclusive, head to some kind of settlement of the Syrian civil war and the Syrian army, a fine army, [and] join with American air power and our Iraqi allies. 'All must make common cause against this dreadful threat to civilization,' he said of the terror group. During the Pentagon briefing, Kirby left the door open for American attacks against ISIS on Syrian soil, reacting to questions about remarks Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel made a day earlier. Syrian rebels continue to be a thorn in Bashar al-Assad's side, but will the U.S. arm them or make common cause with Assad against ISIS? 'The secretary didn't rule anything in or out,' Kirby said. 'We haven't made any decisions with regard to Syria. ... I'm not going to speak about operations that we're not conducting.' He acknowledged that ISIS poses and 'imminent threat' and has 'grown in capability, with speed, helped along by resourcing from some of their own criminal activity, as well as donations and ransoms. ... We've all been watching this.' But his emphasis remained on U.S. 'support' missions intended to ease the tasks in front of Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces, on international coalition-building, and on hopes for an 'inclusive' Baghdad government that would no longer alienate Iraq's Sunni minority. With a hat-tip toward other nations that have taken part in missions to date, he added that 'we have been encouraged by the assistance of international partners like the UK.' 'And I also want to take the opportunity today to thank Albania. Albania has now come forward and offered to conduct resupply missions with Kurdish forces, which again we're very grateful for.' The George W. Bush administration was universally mocked in 2003 when it boasted that Poland had joined the the United Kingdom and Australia as the only nations offering military support duringand after the U.S. invasion. Other nations like the Marshall Islands and Micronesia,which don't have standing armies, were also singled out for praise by the Bush White House.","Deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes warned ISIS that 'if you come after Americans, we’re going to come after you wherever you are'

"The director of an Oscar-nominated film about the killing of Osama bin Laden was given classified information about the operation by United States intelligence chiefs. Zero Dark Thirty director Kathryn Bigelow and her screenwriting partner Mark Boal were provided with a complete 'roadmap' of how the raid was planned during a 45 minute meeting with Michael Vickers - the country's highest ranking civilian intelligence official. The filmmakers also received briefings from top CIA and military intelligence officers and Navy Seals who carried out Operation Neptune Spear - attacking bin Laden's compound in Pakistan in May 2011. Secrecy: Zero Dark Thirty filmmakers Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal were given classified information . The transcript of the interview, which took place three months after the terrorist leader's death, has this week been published by the National Security Archive (NSA) at George Washington University in Washington. Classified: Intelligence chief Michale Vickers gave information to the filmmakers during an interview . It follows a freedom of information request by campaign group Judicial Watch. Its president Tom Fitton had said the White House acted improperly by giving 'politically-connected filmmakers extraordinary and secret access to bin Laden raid information' Following the raid, the White House and Pentagon held a series of contradictory briefings and the NSA argues that an authoritative account of the operation has never been published. The group accused the Obama administration of sharing the 'intimate details' to help the filmmakers release a movie ‘perfectly timed to give a home-stretch boost' last year's re-election campaign. The NSA said much of the operation in Abbottabad is still 'shrouded in secrecy', with many details of the raid having never been released. Chris Farrell, of Judicial Watch, . told The Independent: 'Either you admit you gave special excess to your . pet film directors, or you make the information available to everyone.' A statement on the Judicial Watch website said that the film pushed the Obama narrative, and added: 'Barack Obama comes off as a hero character. 'We see him morally preening on a news program and hear him described as 'thoughtful and analytical.' Oscar nominated: Navy SEALs prepare to breach a locked door in bin Laden's compound in Dark Zero Thirty . Raid: Pakistani security officials stand guard as workers demolish the compound in Abbottabad . 'Boal and Bigelow seemed to have gone out of their way (short of producing a two-hour campaign commercial) to project the Obama administration as 'gutsy' for ordering the raid.' Hunted: Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011 . An investigation into whether Mr Vickers broke any rules by briefing Ms Bigelow and Mr Boal has been launched by the Department of Defense. Mr Boal and Ms Bigelow, who spent several years working on the film, have insisted that they went through the proper official channels in the intelligence community and did not have access to any classified information. Zero Dark Thirty opened across the U.S. on January 11 and has been nominated for five Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actress for Jessica Chastain and Best Original Screenplay. It was nominated for four Golden Globes, with Chastain winning Best Actress. Mr Boal and Ms Bigelow have both won Oscars fro the Hurt Locker. Ms Bigelow has defended her latest film's torture scene, saying criticism of the practices might be better directed towards government policymakers. After bin Laden - who was hunted by the US since the 9/11 terrorist attacks - was killed, the Obama administration said his body was buried at sea off the USS Carl Vinson in accordance with Islamic tradition. The raid was completed shortly after 1am local time when he was shot once in the chest and once in the head by a Navy Seal who announced, 'For God and country Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo', because Geronimo was the code-name given to the al-Qaeda leader. President Obama watched the operation unfold in the White House Situation Room, and declared: 'We got him.' 'We got him': The Obama administration watches the operation unfold from the situation room . Before the U.S Navy SEALS left the compound they destroyed one of the two top secret stealth helicopters that had delivered them to the house after it encountered difficulties on landing and therefore could not take off again. Intelligence recovered from the home made public in the aftermath of his death showed Osama bin Laden wrapped up from the cold watching news coverage of himself. And it was later reported from Pakistan that one of bin Laden's wives told the Pakistani authorities that they had lived there for five years without detection. In February 2012, Pakistani security agencies demolished the building to stop it becoming a shrine to the deceased al-Qaeda supremo.","Kathryn Bigelow given classified information by high ranking official .

"Army soldiers today recovered the bodies of murdered Miss Honduras and her sister after police revealed they had arrested her sibling's boyfriend on suspicion of shooting the two women dead in a jealous rage. The bodies of beauty queen Maria Jose Alvarado, 19, and her sister Sofia, 23, were taken away in body bags by soldiers and forensic experts after they were found buried in a river bank close to the spa where they disappeared six days ago. General Ramon Sabillon, the National Police director, said Sofia's boyfriend Plutarco Antonio Ruiz had confessed to the killings today and led authorities to the bodies  in a mountainous area in Santa Barbara.

The bodies believed to belong to Maria Jose Alvarado, 19, and her sister Sofia, 23, were found dumped in a river bank ditch (pictured) near to the spa where they were last in a mountainous area in Santa Barbara . The bodies were found near La Aguagua spa, where the sisters had gone last Thursday to celebrate Ruiz's birthday. The trip came a week before Miss Alvarado, the reigning Miss Honduras, was due to fly to London to compete in the Miss World competition. The sisters, who both grew up in the area, were shot to death and appeared to have been killed the night they disappeared, police said. Officers said an accomplice, Aris Maldonado, was also being held. The two said they buried the bodies near the river so they would decompose quickly, according to Sabillon. He said Ruiz allegedly shot his girlfriend, Sofia, because she was dancing with another man. After a fierce argument, he pulled out a pistol and fired at Sofia first, then Miss Honduras as she tried to flee. Teresa Munoz, the sisters' mother, told Televicentro: 'They were not very astute about assessing the people around them. They were just friendly. 'They were taken out by people they hadn't known very long.' She claimed Ruiz called her the following morning, acting nervous and claiming the young women had left the party in a car with some other people.

Sabillon said authorities were awaiting confirmation from forensic officials that the bodies were of Miss Alvarado and her sister. The BBC reported Leandro Osorio, the head of the country's Bereau of Criminal Investigation, as saying the two women's bodies had been found in Cablotales Village, near the Aguagua River. He said: 'We are 100 per cent sure that it's them'. Forensic experts and Army soldiers from Honduras could today be seen carrying the bodies in body bags out of the wooded area and into emergency vehicles. The two young women disappeared on Thursday outside Honduras' northern city of Santa Barbara after a birthday party at a local resort, only days before Alvarado was set fly to London to compete in the Miss World competition. During Plutarco's arrest, police also seized a pistol and two vehicles in the hope they will provide some clues towards what happened. The case has caused consternation in the notoriously violent central American country, home to the most dangerous city on the planet.

Missing beauty: Miss Alvarado was due to fly to London  to compete in the Miss World competition, scheduled for tomorrow . San Pedro Sula, just over 30 miles from Santa Barbara, is the murder capital of the world with more than 1,200 killings a year among its nearly one million inhabitants. On the night they disappeared, Sofia arrived at a party on Thursday in a champagne-colored private car with unidentified men to pick up her sister at 6pm. Police say the women were last seen leaving the party in the champagne-colored car. The Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, tops the list of the world's most violent places on earth. At least three murders are reported each day in the coffee-exporting nation, mostly at the hands of vicious gangs and drug cartels who operate freely in an area of lawlessness, poverty and a decaying justice system. Gunmen have taken control of slums and villages, well aware that the police are ineffective and corrupt. San Pedro Sula recorded 1,218 homicides in 2012 (a rate of 3.3 murders a day). It was followed by Acapulco, Mexico; Caracas, Venezuela and Distrito Central, Honduras. The same year, it was reported that San Pedro Sula is saddled with one of South America's weakest economies - and nearly 70 per cent of the population live in poverty. San Pedro Sula's murder rate of 169 per 100,000 people far surpasses anything in north America or much larger cities like Lagos or Sao Paulo. Maria Jose described herself on a Miss World website profile as an aspiring diplomat who enjoys playing volleyball and football in her spare time. She beat 18 contestants to win the Miss Honduras crown in April. She missed an appointment on Sunday evening to try on the dress she hopes to win Miss World with. Earlier this week, the women's mother Teresa de Jesus pleaded: 'Open your hearts and understand my pain. 'There is an all-powerful God that sees everything and I hope you set them free.' Miss World is due to kick off tomorrow, with 120 contestants competing for the crown. The grand finale takes place on December 14 at ExCel London in the heart of the capital's Royal Docks area. Swiss-born medical student Carina Tyrrell, 24, a qualified ski instructor and competition level gymnast, is representing England. Scotland is represented by media and marketing student Ellie McKeating, 20, from Glasgow.

"A British expat has been reunited with his leather wallet and passport – nearly two decades after they were lost during a train ride across Switzerland. It appears no one stole anything during the 18 years that Colin Mendoza’s wallet was missing as it still contains the passport and his long-expired credit cards, driving licence, receipts and an identification card from an old job. But where it was all this time and how it was discovered remain a mystery that may never be solved. Lost and found: Colin Mendoza has been reunited with a wallet that he lost 18 years ago in Switzerland . If this wallet could talk: The wallet was discovered in a shopping mall in the mountain town of Chur . Colin still isn’t certain how he lost the wallet while travelling by train from Zurich Airport to Geneva in 1996. He fell asleep on the train and didn’t realise it was missing until he was getting into a car in Geneva. He reported it missing to police and then went through the hassle of getting a new passport and cancelling and ordering new credit cards. Years passed and Colin, who now lives in the US state of Connecticut, forgot about the incident until he received a surprise email from a police officer in the tiny Swiss mountain town of Chur. It turns out someone found the wallet on the floor of a shopping centre in Chur – more than four hours by train from Geneva and 90 minutes from Zurich – and handed it in to local police. Chur police snapped this photo of Mr Mendoza's wallet after it was handed over to them in October . After a quick search online an officer found his LinkedIn profile and tracked down his email address. Colin, 50, told MailOnline Travel: ‘There was a little bit of shock and surprise when I received the email. It was an “Oh my God” kind of thing. ‘I’m not sure what I’m going to do with it. The fact that everything was intact and it was found in a supermarket, that’s weird.’ The wallet still contains Colin Mendoza's old passport, credit cards, receipts and a work identification card . Colin said the wallet itself – a gift from his wife – is in good condition and showing few signs of additional wear and tear. ‘I’m amazed at its good condition and that it had all my old ID – my passport, driving licence, old company ID and all my credit cards. I’m not sure if at the time there was money inside or not, but I think not. ‘My wife even remembered the wallet as she gave it to me.’ Police say they have no idea how the wallet found its way from the train to the town of Chur (pictured) Colin, a married father of two who runs his own media business, said the police haven’t figured out how the wallet ended up in Chur. A police spokesman told Switzerland's SDA news agency: ‘We have no idea how it found its way from the train to a shopping centre. ‘But the man was surprised and delighted to have it back, although the passport and credit cards had of course long expired.’","Colin Mendoza lost wallet while travelling from Zurich to Geneva in 1996 .

"A 100 proof vodka-infused turkey is being served at over 100 pubs and taverns across New York City to celebrate this year's Thanksgiving. The boozy bird, which was unveiled at O'Casey's Restaurant and Irish Pub in Midtown yesterday, is cooked using a whopping five different vodka flavors: cherry, peach, lemon, and apple. For big birds like the ones used at O'Casey's the turkey is infused with vodka every six hours over the course of three days. Thanksgiving spirit: The turkey will be infused with five different flavors of vodka: cherry, peach, lemon, and apple . According to O'Casey's owner Paul Hurley, the amount of alcohol per serving depends almost entirely on how long the turkey is roasted, which is generally up to the chef's discretion. O'Casey's turkey is cooked for five hours, after which the chef removes excess sauce and mixes it with more 100 proof vodka to create a gravy that can be served with a straw. According to Mr Hurley, customers have been highly encouraged to use O'Casey's free ride service after indulging in the bird. A Gothamist blogger who tried the turkey revealed that it is, 'not as alcoholic as I expected it to be,' adding: 'It tastes more like you ate some turkey after taking a shot of vodka. Though after two bites I think I'm feeling buzzed. I'm not sure if that's a placebo effect.' The idea for a vodka-infused turkey first began in Ireland when Mr Hurley's mother asked why the Christmas turkey didn't have any vodka in it. From there, Mr Hurley and his mother developed a recipe with George 100 proof vodka. After careful research and taste-testing, the restaurateur first unveiled the boozy meal at O'Casey's in 2009. Hitting the sauce: The gravy will be made with 100-proof vodka, giving an extra flavor and kick to the already bombed bird . The turkey was a smash hit and quickly sold out. Mr Hurley shared his recipe with other New York City chefs and restaurant owners and it is now available at over 100 restaurants and pubs during the Thanksgiving season including P.D. O'Hurley's, P.D. O'Hurley's West End, Pier 84, and Hudson Beach Cafe. The unveiling at O'Casey's Restaurant and Pub was hosted by the United Restaurant and Tavern Owners Association on Tuesday November 25 at lunchtime, just in time for an afternoon pick me up. If you'd like to try this one at home, see the recipe below. Ingredients: . Directions: . Put turkey breast-down the night before with the diced vegetables, one bunch each of fresh herbs, cranberries and 4 oz of each flavored vodka. Refrigerate to marinate. On the morning of Thanksgiving, turn the turkey breast-up and cover with herbs and vegetables. Roast in oven at 375 degrees for three hours. Blend the remaining fresh herbs, olive oil and Georgi Vodka Blue and inject into turkey.","Over 100 pubs and restaurants in New York City are serving vodka-infused turkey for Thanksgiving .

"A secret stash of aerial espionage photos of Britain taken by the Nazis and hidden at the end of the war have finally been published after they turned up in a charity shop. The photos are the subject of a new book by historian and author Nigel Clarke of Lyme Regis, Dorset. They were discovered in a secret archive of wartime reconnaissance pictures commissioned by the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Holiday hotspot: This picture of Portishead was discovered in a secret archive of wartime reconnaissance pictures commissioned by the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler . The pictures, this one of Dartmouth in Devon, were taken by the Nazis and hidden at the end of the war. They have finally been published after they turned up in a charity shop . The photographs of Britain and Ireland were taken between 1939 and 1943 for target and intelligence purposes by the German air force the Luftwaffe. Mr Clarke has spent years researching and collecting the images. As the collection grew and more information was found out about the secret archive it was decided to put the pictures in a book. Mr Clarke said: 'My initial interest was aroused by the discovery of a set of aerial images of Dorset towns taken by the Luftwaffe, which I discovered among a collection of old books in the corner of a local charity shop.

"Vulnerable: Richard Price with his seven-year-old daughter, Jessica, who admires One Direction . Visitors to our house can be left in no doubt as to which pop stars my daughter Jessica admires. Drinks are taken from a One Direction cup, their fresh-faces beaming out at us at breakfast, lunch and dinner. The band’s latest album, Midnight Memories, is on permanent loop, their movie This Is Us is watched every single weekend, while posters of Harry Styles, 20, Zayn Malik, 21, and 22-year-old Louis Tomlinson gaze down from her bedroom wall. Louis is her favourite, she tells me on a daily basis. She believes he can do no wrong. Last week, when my wife calmly suggested the late Freddie Mercury was a better singer than Louis, World War III broke out. Tears were shed and in the fallout, I found myself under attack for claiming, months earlier, that The Beatles were more successful than One Direction. Facts, you see, are incidental. Because my daughter isn’t a headstrong 15-year-old, but a seven-year-old. To a seven, eight or nine-year-old, heroes are invincible, to be admired unquestioningly. Just as schoolboys will copy the exploits of their football idols, so will One Direction’s impressionable fans ape their every move. Which is why it is so dispiriting that two of the stars — Louis and Zayn — were filmed smoking pot and bragging about drug-taking. The video provided proof, if any were needed, that One Direction are now a million miles from the sanitised image peddled to their target audience of tweenagers. The world’s most successful boy band are most popular not with young women their own age, but with little girls like my daughter. Like many parents of One Direction fans, I’ve spent the day hiding the newspaper and changing the TV channel when news about the band comes on. It is a short-term strategy. When this week’s half-term is over, she will go back to school, and no titbit of One Direction gossip eludes the fans in the playground. So I will have to find a way of explaining to a seven-year-old why taking drugs is bad. Where to begin, when she doesn’t even know what drugs are? This isn’t the first time I’ve had reservations about just how suitable her idols are for their tweenage fans. They seem to have changed radically since their launch on the 2010 series of The X Factor. 'Dispiriting': A video has emerged showing Louis and Zayn (above) smoking pot and bragging about drug-taking . Gone are the clean-cut hairstyles and fresh-faces, replaced by tattoos, celebrity girlfriends, all-night partying and half-naked pictures on social networking sites such as Twitter. Surprising? No, not really. But for parents like me, a genuine problem. It’s Jessica’s eighth birthday next week, and a few months ago she began lobbying for her present — tickets to One Direction’s Wembley concert, on the eve of her birthday. More than 70,000 fans will be hanging on their heart-throbs’ every word and gesture, and while plenty of girls Jessica’s age will be in the audience, as far as my wife and I are concerned, she is far too young to attend. This decision prompted hours of sobbing followed by weeks of whining, but today I feel utterly vindicated — not to mention furious at the young men who have let my little girl down. Heart-throbs: Louis (left) and Zayn are pictured performing at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland last night . Influential: One Direction's impressionable fans will ape their every move, says Richard. Above, Louis and Zayn . Because, while I’m sure men will prove themselves unworthy of my daughter in future, I didn’t know it would happen so soon. How could they show her and their other young fans so little respect? Do they care so little about the impressionable kids who will now turn to their parents to ask why Zayn was smoking something called ‘Mary J’? It seems they don’t care at all. Because, as well as the cannabis smoking, the footage shows a sarcastic exchange between Zayn and Louis (or ‘Zouis’, as their dedicated young fans refer to the duo) about how they need a more mature image. One Direction’s last book, according to Louis, was ‘so girly and not cool’. Their voices dripping with scorn, their contempt for such childish content is palpable. Concern: Richard Price is pictured with his wife Jenny, daughter Jessica and four-year-old son, James . These are the same books which I spent . £17 a pop on for Jess’s last birthday and Christmas presents, . contributing to Louis’s personal £14 million fortune. Louis and Zayn say they want to grow up, yet their band is sold to the public via One Direction lunchboxes, stickers and dolls. How many fashionable teenagers do they expect to wear One Direction pyjamas and onesies? The money brought in by these ventures borders on the obscene and they would be taking us for fools if they denied the ‘tween’ market is at the heart of it. Today, I wish I could send every One Direction CD, poster and bit of plastic tat back. I find myself utterly furious at the downright stupidity of these spoiled fools. What they fail to understand is that with their privilege comes a debt — and a responsibility — to their fans. This dope smoking act was never part of the bargain. When One Direction were launched by Simon Cowell they were squeaky clean. Early promotional shots are almost unrecognisable alongside the tattooed, brooding figures we see today. Like those tattoos, the change has crept upon us slowly. Harry and Zayn have hooked up with pop star girlfriends (the latter being caught cheating on his with a barmaid). Liam risked his life to pose for a photograph standing on the roof of a skyscraper (he apologised, grudgingly, but Jessica thought it was a hoot). 'All about money': One Direction open the UK leg of their world tour, Where We Are, in Sunderland last night . Then last year Louis and Zayn were . spotted smoking a suspicious looking roll-up cigarette on a yacht. This . latest footage is no storm in a teacup. It strikes at the very heart of . the band’s existence. For One Direction are all about money, as you would expect of any ‘artist’ launched by Simon Cowell. He is . dealing with the fallout personally, in the knowledge he stands to miss . out on a fortune if his protégées don’t weather the storm. Their current tour is a gruelling . 88-date extravaganza which will see them take in South and North America . and much of Europe, something which would put pressure on even the most . energetic young performer. Once merchandising is taken into consideration, the tour is forecast to gross $1 billion, making it the biggest in history. Worry: Richard and his wife decided to ban their daughter from going to One Direction's Wembley concert . There was a time, not so long ago, when I saw One Direction as a harmless distraction for my daughter and her friends. They were cheeky without being too risqué, while their movie was as funny and as inoffensive as The Beatles in A Hard Day’s Night. I even liked some of their songs. Today the mask slipped, and all I can do is count my blessings that I banned Jessica from going to that Wembley concert.","Richard Price's seven-year-old daughter Jessica admires One Direction .

"A report said had MI5 known about Adebowale’s messages, Rigby’s murder could have been avoided . The family of Lee Rigby today accused Facebook of failing to help stop his killers as it emerged the social network has still not handed over data from five accounts opened by one of his extremist murderers. His sister Sara said the internet giant had ‘blood on its hands’ because it had hosted exchanges between one of the soldier’s murderers and an Al Qaeda extremist, in which the former said: ‘Let’s kill a soldier.’ However, the social network’s staff failed to tell MI5 about the ‘graphic and emotive’ posts from Michael Adebowale, made just six months before the atrocity took place. Incredibly, Facebook had already disabled seven of his accounts – five of which were flagged over links to extremism – without informing security services. The damning report by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee released yesterday also revealed that Adebowale had 11 Facebook accounts but GCHQ has still only been given the contents of six. It said in 'over a year since the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, GCHQ has not received all the information requested. Having not seen the content of the other five accounts, GCHQ cannot be certain that there is no evidence of attack planning in the rest of these accounts'. But civil liberties campaigners fear Drummer Rigby's appalling murder is being used as 'an excuse to justify the further surveillance and monitoring of the entire UK population'. And former MI6 director Richard Barratt said today it would be 'almost impossible' and 'unfair' for businesses like Facebook to hand over  terror related activity to the security services. He told the Today programme: 'I think it's unfair to ask companies to make that decision. I think there has to be a legal basis for them so they know what they are to do and what not do to'. Barrett added it was 'almost impossible' because of 'legalities' and because there are 125million posts a day on Facebook passing on terror-related posts would be an 'enormous job'. Fusilier Rigby’s sister, Sara McClure, 25, said: ‘Facebook have my brother’s blood on their hands. I hold them partly responsible for Lee’s murder. 'I suppose it has given me someone to blame but I’m not sure that’s what I wanted. Knowing it could have been prevented and it wasn’t prevented. I blame the failings of MI5 and the internet companies. Mainly the internet companies’ Twisted: Lee Rigby's killers Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale. Facebook hosted exchanges between Adebowale and an Al Qaeda extremist, in which the former said: ‘Let’s kill a soldier’ Michael Adebolajo shows a bloodied hand and knives following the murder of soldier Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich on May 22, 2013 . Response: Former MI6 director Richard Barratt said it would be 'almost impossible' and 'unfair' for  Facebook to hand over terror related activity but David Cameron claims: ‘It is their social responsibility to act on this' In a long-awaited report, Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee yesterday said that had MI5 known about Adebowale’s messages, Fusilier Rigby’s murder could have been avoided. And in a damning indictment of US-based tech firms, it said the same mistakes could have been made by websites run by Google, Yahoo, Apple, Twitter or Microsoft, which have become a ‘haven’ for terrorists. Lee Rigby's step-father Ian said: ‘We are left with questions. The report doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do. It has brought back memories - A lot of the feelings are back and it doesn’t give the correct information as to the reason the delays happened. ‘The companies’ duty of care to its customers is to use information like that if necessary when the discover it'. David Cameron said the internet companies – once frequently courted by his government – were being ‘used to plot murder and mayhem’, adding: ‘It is their social responsibility to act on this ... we expect them to live up to it.’ The murdered soldier's family said today that the Prime Minister is the only person with the answers they need. Ian Rigby said: 'He's the only one who has the full report and probably the only one who could get the answers that we want'. Heartbroken: The family of Lee Rigby, pictured after the trial of his killers, blame the security services and particularly internet companies like Facebook for not preventing his death . Files: Michael Adebolajo's profile compiled by secret services detailing his movements and associates in the years before he murdered Drummer Rigby . Background: Adebowale had fewer convictions than Adebolajo but it was his interest in extremist material and posts on Facebook that has sparked debate over whether social networks should have told MI5 and MI6 . The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said today: ‘Any meeting they ask for they will get.’ Talking about the affect his brutal murder had on his family he said: ‘When we are together as a family we laugh about memories of Lee. But we all have difficulty  talking about the murder and what has happened since. We are a normal family drawn into this situation. ‘We have lost a son but we have never been able to mourn Lee. 'The loss of Lee will never go away. You learn to live with it over time, but it's still with you over time. Former home secretary Jack Straw said there was a ‘cultural problem amongst the leadership of some of these [sites] who have got a distorted libertarian ideology, who believe that somehow this allows them to be wholly detached from responsibility’. Miss McClure told The Sun newspaper: ‘It is totally clear from this report that information so vital could have alerted our security services to this terror plot.’ The ISC criticised both MI5 and MI6 for a string of blunders when tracking Fusilier Rigby’s killers, Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo – but, controversially, it insisted that given what the agencies knew at the time, they could not be blamed for failing to prevent the murder. This is despite the fact that: . An application for intrusive surveillance on Adebowale in 2013 took ‘nearly twice as long as it should have’ amid internal wrangling by MI5. Home Secretary Theresa May signed the warrant only after Fusilier Rigby was dead. However, the ISC’s 191-page report also highlights an exchange on Facebook between Adebowale and a fanatic since codenamed FOXTROT. Adebowale expressed his desire to murder a soldier in retaliation for UK military action in Iraq and Afghanistan, and was advised on different methods of murder. Announcing £130million in funding to help the fight against ‘self-starting’ terrorists, the Prime Minister declared: ‘We must not accept that these communications are beyond the reach of the authorities or the internet companies themselves. Their networks are being used to plot murder and mayhem.’ But Isabella Sankey of Liberty said: ‘The ISC shamefully spins the facts, seeking to blame [websites] for not doing the agencies’ work for them.’ Executive director Jim Killock, of the Open Rights Group, said: 'To pass the blame to internet companies is to use Fusilier Rigby’s murder to make cheap political points. 'The committee should not use the appalling murder of Fusilier Rigby as an excuse to justify the further surveillance and monitoring of the entire UK population,' he said. A senior internet industry source told the Independent there has been a 'coordinated' attempt by the security services 'to attack US-based technology companies in particular'. A Facebook spokesman said: ‘Like everyone else, we were horrified by the vicious murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. We don’t comment on individual cases but Facebook’s policies are clear – we do not allow terrorist content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes.’","Facebook has failed to give GCHQ 5 of Michael Adebowale's 11 accounts .

"Fifteen years ago, when he was plucked from obscurity to play the role of ballet-dancing Billy Elliot in the hit film, Jamie Bell felt like the luckiest boy in the world. He was so grateful to the man who discovered him - the film's flamboyant director Stephen Daldry - that he promptly left his down-to-earth family in Teesside and moved in with Daldry and his then partner, stage designer Ian MacNeil. It was an intense relationship, with Daldry assuming the role of surrogate dad to a teenager whose biological father had never played any role in his life. Scroll down for video . 'Mutual decision' to break up: Evan Rachel Wood and Jamie Bell before their split . After appearing in the film, which told the story of an 11-year-old boy who becomes a successful ballet dancer in the face of huge prejudice, Jamie was catapulted to instant fame and fortune. He moved from a post-war semi to a 15th century manor in the Home Counties, and from a working-class area to a metrosexual acting crowd that moved between London, New York and Los Angeles. Just how quickly he left his family behind  was obvious when he won a Bafta for his performance as Billy, and kissed Daldry in celebration rather than his mother, Eileen. This was to be just the start of a bohemian, transatlantic life, which saw Jamie Bell attempt, albeit with limited success, to crack Hollywood. Encouraged by his mentor Daldry, he embraced the progressive values of his new showbusiness world. The actor still describes himself as a 'lucky husband' on Twitter . His Twitter feed is liberally sprinkled with gay rights postings, while he was proud to set up home with the openly bisexual actress, Evan Rachel Wood, 26, who two years ago became his wife and last summer bore him a son. All in all, Jamie, 28, seemed to lead an enviably charmed life. Yet last month the couple gave a statement announcing the end of their marriage, speaking vaguely of their 'mutual decision' to part, their 'love and respect' and a commitment to 'co-parenting' their son. Whatever the couple's claims, in truth the split was far from amicable. More telling were Jamie's posts on Twitter, where he still poignantly describes himself as 'a lucky husband, a devoted father, an actor, tap dancer, Arsenal supporter and major procrastinator'. Just three weeks ago he posted 'ILY [I LOVE YOU] @Evanrachel wood. Just in case I don't tell you enough', before adding forlornly three days later: 'And then there was nothing.' Days later, he posted one more comment (which has subsequently been deleted): 'Don't punish people for things they can't control.' Cryptic though it sounds, the meaning was immediately clear to his friends and family. For many believe it is his wife's enduring attraction to women that lies at the heart of their split. The night before she announced the breakdown of her marriage, the blonde actress appeared at a gala in Los Angeles titled 'An Evening With Women' - a fundraiser for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. There she posed for a photograph with Milla Jovovich, an actress she has openly confessed to having a crush on, and Michelle Rodriguez, another bisexual actress who has reportedly set her  cap at Evan after allegedly splitting from British supermodel Cara Delevingne. Days later Evan was posing for a photograph with another prominent lesbian couple, the model Ruby Rose and fashion designer Phoebe Dahl (granddaughter of the author Roald). Like Jamie's cryptic comment, this image was also swiftly deleted from social networking sites after the split was announced. But while Evan may be enjoying a whirl of parties, Jamie - whose acting career is still to fulfill its early promise - is said to be reeling from the split. 'It's a miracle he hasn’t had a complete nervous breakdown, but he's a canny lad and a strong person,' a childhood friend said this week. 'All the good things in his life happened because of Billy Elliot, but so did all the rubbish that drags him down. He was confused for a long time, then he found Evan and sorted it all out. Now he's back where he started. Overnight success: Jamie found fame as a boy playing Billy Elliot . 'I love him to bits, but I wouldn't swap places with him for all the tea in China.' Nor does Jamie have a close and supportive family to turn to. His father John, 58, a toolmaker, played no part in his life, leaving to start a new life and family on the South Coast. Jamie's mother, Eileen, was left to raise him and his older sister, Kathryn, 33, as a single mother on her receptionist’s wage. It was into this situation that Stephen Daldry landed, quickly becoming the father figure Jamie had so sorely missed. The director taught Jamie to shoot and drive, presenting him with a shotgun and one of the U.S. Army jeeps used in the film Saving Private Ryan. Schooling was gradually set aside as his career took off, with a series of well-received yet unremarkable movies, such as Nicholas Nickleby. His early girlfriends, who included a shop assistant and a nurse, could not compete with the glitz of his film-star life. Jamie rapidly developed a reputation for being spiky and awkward. He gave interviews in a T-shirt emblazoned with the words: 'F*** you.' By the age of 18 he was fully immersed in the louche world of showbusiness and about to film his first major adult role, in Peter Jackson’s blockbuster adaptation of King Kong, when he met Evan, from North Carolina. 'She fitted the bill perfectly,' says his friend. 'She was totally different from the girls at home. Really alternative, cool and with that incredible confidence American girls have. Jamie was just dazzled by her.' The couple shortly after they met filming King Kong: They went on to have a son together . Yet for all his adopted quirkiness, Jamie remained fundamentally conservative compared to Evan, who soon ended their relationship, before taking up with another man, rock star Marilyn Manson, almost 25 years her senior. It was to mark a low point for Jamie, who was also stung by the relative failure of King Kong. He moved into a flat with a 'special friend' - a man he never identified, but had known since before Billy Elliot - and they were inseparable for a while, though there is no suggestion of a romantic involvement. His rare visits back home to Co. Durham were increasingly awkward. On one occasion a stranger spat on him, whereupon Jamie's companion chased him down the road to dish out summary justice. He became increasingly withdrawn and between the ages of 22 and 25 effectively took a career break as the major roles he craved failed to materialise. Salvation came in the form of Steven Spielberg, who cast him as the lead in his adaptation of the comic book Tintin. Evan when she was pregnant: The couple will now share custody of their son . But though the film turned a healthy profit, it barely registered in the American heartland regarded by Hollywood as the true mark of stardom. By then he had bought an apartment in New York. His broad Northern accent was replaced with a mid-Atlantic twang. Through it all, however, he craved stability - something he appeared to achieve when he reconciled with Evan in 2011. He moved from New York to Los  Angeles to be near to her, eschewing the starry Hollywood Hills for the more edgy beachside neighbourhoods to the west of the city. The couple were regularly seen out on their bicycles, shopping in organic supermarkets and eating in fashionable coffee shops and restaurants. Jamie also joined his girlfriend as a vocal campaigner for gay rights, seemingly comfortable with her bisexuality. Recent events have cast that in a different light. And Jamie's devastation at the end of their marriage is exacerbated by the prospect of being separated from his son. He has spoken touchingly about how the ten-month-old - whose name has been kept secret by Jamie and Evan - has enriched his life. 'It's amazing. When you become a parent everything changes,' he said recently. 'For such a long time, I thought of myself as a teenager gallivanting around the world taking jobs where I felt like it, but life is totally different now.' He changes nappies, feeds and nurtures his son in a way his own father never did. Friends say that he is determined to play an active role in the boy's life, and that the couple plan to share custody. Somewhat ironically, just as his personal life has taken such a turn for the worse, his faltering career seems to be on the upswing. Jamie is filming a hotly anticipated remake of the Fantastic Four superhero franchise, which may yet launch him onto the Hollywood A-list. As Stephen Daldry said in the aftermath of his big breakthrough: 'Jamie is just amazing. I hope we don't screw him up, turn him into Drew Barrymore or something.' Given the latest turn of events in poor Jamie's life, it’s as well that his talent is matched by a remarkable emotional resilience.","Fifteen years ago, Jamie Bell felt like the luckiest boy in the world .

Surgery: A trio of brothers went under the knife because they developed breasts due to a genetic condition . Rare: The trio of brothers who grew breasts due to a rare genetic disorder are now 'living a normal life' after going under the knife . The plight of the siblings, which some have described as a hoax, was highlighted when their desperate father Felipe appealed for help, via the island's news programme Zona5, from specialists. His work as a food stall seller, and the absence of the boys' mother who left when they were little, meant he did not have enough money to pay for an operation. His emotional plea was picked up by medics at the Marcelino Velez Santana Hospital, whose boss Dr Pedro Antonio Delgado agreed to pay for the operations. After tests to see if Yeuri, his 11-year-old brother Gabriel and 12-year-old Daniu could undergo treatment, they each went under the knife for two hours. Ecstatic: Felipe Ramirez, pictured here with one of his sons in the background, said he was thrilled with the outcome of the surgery . Medics: Dr Elbi Morla (left) said the operation would be a key moment in the boy's lives, while Dr Pedro Antonio Delgado (right) confirmed his hospital paid entirely for the surgery .

After the operation, for the condition called gynecomastia which affects males who have a hormonal imbalance, Dr Elbi Morla told the show: 'In reality, this is a key moment in their evolution. 'It was something that was affecting them greatly.' And a grateful Felipe added: 'They are now normal men. They have had them taken off. I never had the hope that this would happen. 'I never had the money to do this. I'm so thankful to the press for helping.'

"Jose Mourinho admits Diego Costa can do 'almost nothing' between matches as Chelsea’s medical department patch up their £32million striker in an attempt to keep him on the pitch. Costa scored his eighth of the season as Mourinho’s team beat Aston Villa 3-0 at Stamford Bridge yesterday to stay top of the Barclays Premier League and extend their unbeaten start. The Chelsea boss wants the Brazil-born Spain international striker to start again at Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday and at home to Arsenal next Sunday, but knows he must be handled with extreme care. Chelsea face a dilemma over how best to use injury-hit in-form striker Diego Costa . Jose Mourinho admits that Chelsea are powerless to help Costa unless he gets extended rest . 'He is doing almost nothing,' said Mourinho. 'He’s just resting and recovering from the tight muscle he has every time he accumulates fatigue. I hope he goes home after this game and sleeps until tomorrow morning. 'He cannot be at the top of his game but even so, scoring a goal is good for his confidence, especially for a player who isn’t training as he should because we are protecting him.' Chelsea would like Spain to give Costa time to rest the injury during next month’s international break but will not make a formal request to their manager Vicente del Bosque. Costa celebrates his eighth goal in Chelsea blue as is joined by the Stamford Bridge crowd and Willian . Spain manager Vincente del Bosque will have the final say over whether to call up Costa for the national team . Mourinho added: 'If he doesn’t go to the national team, and stays here 15 days on treatment, recovering and making the muscle and the areas around muscle stronger, he has the perfect chance to be top for Chelsea and top for national team. 'If he doesn’t have this period, he will be always play one game and then be in trouble for the next one. The muscle is tight and the muscle is in danger to have a rupture. 'We can’t do anything. I can’t speak to Spain manager. It’s not something I should do. From moment they are selected for national team the players belong to them. Everything is in their hands and you have to respect the decisions.” Costa has been in superb form for Chelsea but Mourinho has said he cannot manage three games in a week . The Chelsea manager wants to start his star striker against Sporting Lisbon and at home to Arsenal . Oscar opened the scoring for Chelsea in the seventh minute before Costa headed in the second and made the third for Willian. 'We are happy with what we are doing,' said Mourinho. 'We are not perfect and we have a lot to improve in every area of our game but we are playing well. We have a lead of three points over Southampton, and this is very important. It is not crucial because it’s too early but it is a little bit of space and it gives you a good feeling to be top of the league.'

"A paratrooper who was killed in the Falklands is in line to receive a top gallantry medal after his case was highlighted by The Mail on Sunday, sparking a remarkable U-turn by the Prime Minister. Corporal Stewart McLaughlin, 27, who was killed leading British soldiers during the Battle of Mount Longdon in June 1982, was denied a bravery award after commanders lost his handwritten citation. The recommendation was written just hours after Cpl McLaughlin’s death on the mountain overlooking the capital Port Stanley where British Paras took key enemy positions. Scroll down for video . Inspiraion: Cpl McLaughlin was killed leading British soldiers during the battle of Mount Longdon in June 1982 . Within two days of the battle, British soldiers were able to force the Argentinians to surrender. Cpl McLaughlin’s citation described how he had ‘fought like a demon’ and inspired young Paras in his section by charging towards enemy machine-gun fire shouting: ‘Come on lads, I’m bulletproof, follow me!’ He was killed in the final throes of the battle and hours later his medal citation was misplaced when officers from the 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, were forced to move to another HQ. Last month we reported how David Cameron had blocked a bid by the soldier’s family for Cpl McLaughlin to receive official recognition, telling them it was ‘simply not possible after this amount of time’ to look again at the case. A commemorative plaque for Cpl McLaughlin close to the spot where he fell at Mount Longdon . But now Anna Soubry, the Government Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, has told this newspaper that the Ministry of Defence will make ‘rigorous and extensive enquiries into his case on behalf of his family’. Last night, the soldier’s son, also called Stewart, said: ‘I am hugely grateful to The Mail on Sunday for backing our case. I am also delighted to hear that the Minister is going to launch an investigation, but coming so soon after the Prime Minister telling us that nothing was possible the development has also come as a shock. ‘I grew up without my father, which was hard. But it was harder knowing that he had been denied the medal his courage deserved because his citation was lost.’ After the battle, his commanding officer put him forward for a medal but the handwritten citation was lost .

"Lionel Messi will lead his Argentina side into the World Cup final tonight unaware that he and nearly every other international star at the tournament is at the centre of a multimillion-pound conflict over the future of football. The battle could mean the 2014 competition in Brazil is the last time FIFA can put on a finals with access to global football idols such as Messi, Neymar, Alexis Sanchez and Thomas Muller. Football’s world governing body and top European clubs, represented by the European Club Association, ECA, have shared an uneasy peace through a contract known as a Memorandum of Understanding, MoU, agreed in January 2008, which controls the release of players to international matches. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sepp Blatter entertain with his awkward dance moves . Star: Messi . Star: Neymar . Star: Rodriguez . Star: Rooney . Worry: Blatter and FIFA need to agree a new deal to keep the best players at the World Cup . But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the document expires at the end of this month and there is nothing to replace it. A senior source from the ECA, who along with UEFA are signatories to the MoU, said: ‘Without the MoU the clubs won’t feel bound to release players to [international] teams from outside of Europe. ‘The MoU is the recognition of a basic principle — the fact that players are club employees. The clubs release them for the commercial purposes of the FAs belonging to FIFA. ‘But there is also a consequence for the clubs: the acceptance of FIFA rules on the release of players. The MoU expires at the end of July. So what about when Argentina, Brazil and Cameroon call up players for friendlies or qualifiers then?’ Top European clubs have provided more than 75 per cent of the players at this tournament. But they see August 1 as their opportunity to pull the plug on all involvement in any international football run by FIFA, putting at risk the very existence of Sepp Blatter’s organisation. FIFA have shrugged off repeated scandals over the years but the clubs’ ultimatum could finally be what destroys them from within; with no World Cup, FIFA would effectively have no income to keep them going. Last sighting: A big shift by European clubs could spell the end for FIFA's World Cup revenue channels . Roar: Messi could win the Golden Ball at this World Cup, but we might be robbed of him at Russia 2018 . There have been signs of the impending implosion for years. In 2011 Bayern Munich’s president, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who is also ECA chairman, said: ‘I don’t accept any longer that we [should be] guided by people who are not serious and clean. Now is the moment to intervene. Because knowing something is wrong is an obligation to change. ‘I’m not optimistic because they believe the system is working perfectly as it is. It’s a money machine, World Cup after World Cup. And for them, that’s more important than serious and clean governance.’ The effects of the ECA’s threat could be felt by FIFA’s subsidiary confederations within weeks. Qualifiers for continental tournaments in the Americas, Oceania, Africa and Asia are due to begin in September but clubs will feel within their rights to withhold their players from taking part. Stars like Muller, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo will still be able to play for Germany, England and Portugal because separate agreements are in place for European nations through UEFA. Withdrawal: James Rodriguez has lit up the World Cup but only on the agreement of his release from Monaco . But guaranteeing player participation at Euro 2016 has cost UEFA £120million — more than double the £41m FIFA agreed to pay for the tournament in Brazil. Yet clubs see the £727m sitting in FIFA’s bank account as having been generated on the sweat of the stars whose wages they pay. ‘It is £120m for Euro 2016 from UEFA and £41m for 2014,’ said the senior ECA insider. ‘That is a huge difference. ‘There are no numbers at all on the table from FIFA [for the future]. We have made assumptions from our side that there should be at least an equal amount if not more from the Euros.’ There is a history of brinkmanship in football politics and there remains the chance clubs will be bought off by FIFA in the short term, just as they have been in the past. But this time, the ECA’s stance raises questions about whether FIFA can afford to balance the clubs’ interests with those of their own member associations. After announcing a profit of £42m at its Congress last month, FIFA’s president Sepp Blatter distributed ‘extraordinary success premiums’ between the national FAs and continental confederations worth £39m, meaning little was left over. Top players: The likes of Rooney's agreement goes through UEFA but there is a huge disparity . At the same time FIFA promised to double that figure next year — when Blatter stands for re-election as president. Yet he could face revolt from within his own organisation if he overpromises to the ECA. ‘They can’t give more money to the clubs than they do today to the national associations and the confederations,’ the source said. ‘So they have to give more money to them than to us. This is a very difficult one for FIFA.’ Indeed, despite the apparent willingness to talk terms with FIFA, even if a deal can be agreed for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, it would only be a temporary truce. All the signs are that a longer-term deal covering the 2022 World Cup in Qatar would be out of the question. The clubs are holding out on making space in the schedule even for qualifying for that tournament. ‘We have an international calendar up to 2018,’ added the source. ‘There has to be a separate discussion on the World Cup calendar for 2022. That’s due for September and November and the ECA is a stakeholder in those discussions. But there has to be a new MoU for those talks with FIFA on the calendar to take place.’ Thumbs up: But Blatter and co will be worried about the consequences when the deal expires . The world governing body is said to have ignored requests from the clubs to talk about the impending split since 2012. The source claims FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke and Blatter have concentrated on other issues. The source said: ‘This matter has been on Valcke’s table for about two years. We approached FIFA and spoke about an increase for 2014 and 2018 — they said 2014 was not touchable because they had budgets in place. This is very important for FIFA but they seemed to think it was more important to finalise 2014. Time is on our side. They’ll be the ones without protections.’ Another senior source at the separate European Professional Football Leagues body, EPFL, which represents 29 different domestic competition organisers across Europe and their member clubs, corroborated these claims.‘These clubs are those who employ and pay the players,’ said the EPFL source. ‘They’re the big clubs who will always be competing in Europe. The clubs could say, “let’s create something else”. They wouldn’t do UEFA or FIFA competitions. Why even have UEFA?’ FIFA said: ‘FIFA remains, as always, willing to discuss with the ECA on these topics, as it does with all other stakeholders in the world football community.’ World star: Could disputes between clubs and FIFA see Muller miss out on a World Cup record goal tally?","Agreement between top clubs and FIFA that allows players to be released for international fixtures expires next month .

"School lunches have never been known for being appetizing — but these ones are particularly disgusting. Students across America are taking it to social media to demonstrate against the school meal rules championed by First Lady Michelle Obama. They're using the sarcastic hashtag 'ThanksMichelleObama' and posting pictures of piles of mushy lunches, unreasonably small portions and the kind of fare that has some students saying even 'prisoners eat better food.' Scroll down for video . Students across America are using Twitter to post pictures of their disgusting schools meals, which had one of them saying: 'I bet prisoners eat better food' Students have been using the sarcastic hashtag 'ThanksMichelleObama' and posting pictures of piles of mushy lunches and unreasonably small portions . House Republicans are making a final push this month to give schools a temporary break from healthier school meal standards. The school meal rules, phased in since 2012 and championed by first lady Michelle Obama, require more fruits, vegetables and whole grains in the lunch line. The standards also limit sodium, sugar and fat. Some school nutrition directors have lobbied for a break, saying the rules have proven to be costly and restrictive. House Republicans have said they are an overreach, and have pushed a one-year waiver that would allow schools to opt out of the standards if they lost money on meal programs over a six-month period. The waiver language stalled this summer after the first lady lobbied aggressively against it and the White House issued a veto threat. The food and farm spending bill that contained the provision was pulled from the House floor, a move House Republicans attributed to scheduling issues. But the waiver has new life this month as lawmakers are expected to pass a catchall spending bill to keep government programs running. Republican Rep. Robert Aderholt of Alabama, the chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the school meal spending, has been pushing to include the waiver in the wide-ranging bill. Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and Republican Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota both said Thursday that there are ongoing negotiations between the House and the Senate over the waiver. A Senate bill approved by a spending committee in May did not include the waiver, but called for further study on sodium and whole grains requirements. Keely Hale what the  'orange juice' served at her Kentucky school looks like . First Lady Michelle Obama championed the lunch rules that nutrition directors complain are too clostly and restrictive . Filling? Students go hungry after a paltry lettuce-and-cheese sandwich. High schooler Cera Carlile says she received two of these for a meal, which were enough to fill her up, and that 'they were awful' At the time, Hoeven said there was not enough support for the House's one-year waiver in the Senate, even though he was supportive of it himself. But he said this week that could change as lawmakers negotiate the massive year-end spending bill. 'All of these things are part of a negotiation,' Hoeven said. 'I think we'll get something, but we'll have to see where it ends up.' On Friday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., listed 'lowering standards for school lunches for our children' as one of a few 'very destructive riders' that would be unacceptable to Democrats in the spending bill. White House nutrition policy adviser Sam Kass said the White House is 'deeply engaged' on the school meals policy, which has become one of the first lady's signature issues. He said the policy is a top priority for the administration. 'We'll always look to be flexible where appropriate, but what we're not going to do is undermine science and the health of kids in any way,' Kass said. Carly Jo complains about the small portions she gets at her Minnesota school . This summer, Mrs. Obama said she would fight 'until the bitter end' to make sure kids have good nutrition in schools. While many schools have implemented the new standards successfully, others have said it's not working for them. The schools pushing for changes say limits on sodium and requirements for more whole grains are particularly challenging, while some school officials say kids are throwing away fruits and vegetables they are required to take. The changes have been pushed by the School Nutrition Association, a group that counts both school nutrition directors and the food companies that produce many of the school foods among its members. The group said this week that a survey it conducted of more than 1,100 school lunch operators showed that more than half predict program expenses will exceed revenue this year. An Omaha shows the new meals that have 'ruined' his school lunch . In Michigan, student Sidney McIntosh says her chicken nuggets came burned and void of any chicken . Advocates for the healthier meal standards say the changes will take time. They predict there will be fewer problems as kids get used to the new foods and the food industry creates more tasty products that follow the standards, like whole grain pastas and tortillas that are now required to be served. As schools have complained, USDA has shown some flexibility in tweaking the standards. In 2012, just a few months after the first rules went into effect, the department scrapped maximums on proteins and grains after students complained they were hungry. And USDA said earlier this year that schools can put off for two years a requirement that all pastas in schools be whole-grain rich, or more than half whole grain, if they can demonstrate that they have had 'significant challenges' in preparing the pasta. The year-end spending bill won't be the last time Congress takes on the school meal standards, as the overall law governing child nutrition policy, including school lunches, expires next year. Both the House and the new Republican Senate are expected to consider changes to the meal standards as part of legislation renewing the law.

"Should you fall for PR razzmatazz, there was supposed to be only one star on ITV’s relaunched breakfast show this week: a brunette bombshell with a £1 million smile. That was the mooted pay cheque dangled in front of Susanna Reid to defect from the rival BBC programme to host Good Morning Britain, a relaunch of the struggling Daybreak. Famous for her sultry routines on Strictly Come Dancing and her flirtatious leg-crossing when interviewing guests, her appeal was confirmed this week when the lads’ magazine FHM listed her at number 30 in its Sexiest Women in the World list (12 places above ageing model Kate Moss — but nine below Nigella Lawson). Scroll down for video . Susanna Reid, left, has struggled since her debut on ITV's newly launched show 'Good Morning Britain' unlike her younger colleague Charlotte Hawkins, right . Yet amid all the talk about how good or bad the ratings are, a rather inconvenient reality has quietly emerged.

Step forward Charlotte Hawkins, a vicar’s daughter from Sussex, whose reputation has skyrocketed since she took her place on the sofa alongside Susanna and their male counterparts, Ben Shephard and Sean Fletcher. On Monday morning, while her older colleague struggled with the autocue and was visibly angered by the inevitable glitches of a brand new show, Charlotte seemed to glide through with aplomb. Not surprisingly, the reviewers — and viewers — noticed. And if these early signs are anything to go by, Susanna will have a battle on her hands. Lorna Cooper, TV editor of the influential MSN website, was in no doubt. ‘Watched Good Morning Britain this morning,’ she tweeted. ‘Charlotte Hawkins seems far more comfortable than Susanna Reid; she’s been the star so far.’ The general consensus was that the programme needs more of Charlotte and there are already whispers about some tinkering with the format. Monday’s debut of Good Morning Britain attracted an improved audience share, but numbers quickly dropped over the next two days, lagging 970,000 behind the BBC. In a cut-throat fight, ITV’s bosses are desperate to prove they are not forever also-rans at breakfast-time, despite memories of the hapless relaunch in 2010 involving celebrity presenters Christine Bleakley and Adrian Chiles. Viewers were initially disappointed to see Susanna Reid behind a desk along with co-hosts Sean Fletcher, Ben Shephard and Charlotte Hawkins . Indeed, Nick Owen, who was a relative unknown when chosen to present TV-am with great success in the Eighties, had predicted that audiences would be alienated by tales of presenters on stellar salaries. And while the true size of Susanna’s contract is believed to be nearer £400,000 a year, ITV chiefs are keen to groom Charlotte, who earns less than a London head-teacher. One fan told me of the former Sky TV anchorwoman: ‘It’s almost as if she was made for television. She is beautiful, has a stunning figure, is cool under pressure and is professional to a fault. This is a woman who gets into work half an hour early, even when her working day starts at 4am.’ Exactly the type of person that busy mums — the show’s target audience — can associate with. Aged 38, Charlotte is only five years younger than Susanna, but her career path has been more of a steady rise, without resorting to the hoopla of a celebrity show such as Strictly Come Dancing. Indeed, her early life was far removed from the bright lights of showbusiness. She was raised in a rambling vicarage in the village of Sidlesham in West Sussex, three miles south of Chichester, where her father was the local vicar. However, Ms Reid's legs were soon on show to the nation with what has been described as her 'shrinking skirts' Schoolfriends recall a good-natured, pretty girl with a zest for the outdoors. Her social life consisted of barn dances, singing in the choir, acting in the village panto and windsurfing with her older brother off the golden sands at nearby West Wittering. From a young age, she set her heart on becoming a journalist, writing articles as a youth reporter for her local newspaper and then taking shifts at a hospital radio station. Her other passion was the Girl Guides, graduating from being a Brownie and remaining a committed member until she left school. Such solid grounding gave her a sensible view of the burgeoning celebrity culture, telling Guiding Magazine many years later: ‘Far too many celebrities are unhealthily thin and ridiculously materialistic. Like most people, I buy a new dress and pair of shoes every now and again, but people should have a sense of proportion.’ Charlotte, who won the coveted Baden Powell Trefoil (the ultimate Guiding accolade), is unapologetic about her belief in the principles she learned as a teenager. ‘The whole ethos of Guiding is a good one to follow,’ she added. ‘It encourages honesty, reliability, politeness, cheerfulness and respect for others. These things are so important. ‘And I still do a good turn every day — whether it’s holding a door open for someone, helping someone with a pram up some stairs or just taking the time to talk to someone I meet.’ Such a belief in the merits of hard work saw her through a degree in English Literature at Manchester University, followed by a postgraduate degree in broadcast journalism at the London College of Communication. Her professional career began in radio, followed by a stint at Meridian Television, where she rose from trainee to presenter of the main news. In 2007, she moved to Sky Television, where she presented Sunrise, the breakfast news programme, with Eamonn Holmes. Meanwhile Charlotte Hawkins, right, has been a critical success with viewers during the high-profile breakfast show . An influential figure at Sky, the veteran presenter doesn’t suffer fools gladly (his description of Anthea Turner as ‘Princess Tippy Toes’ after a torrid time working on ITV’s breakfast sofa in the Nineties has passed into broadcasting folklore). Yet in Charlotte he found a willing and able protegee. Ever eager to improve, she would arrive to work an hour and a half early, get a grasp of all the news stories of the day and be primed by the producers. On one memorable occasion, the autocue went blank just as the titles rolled and the pair had to improvise. I’m told Eamonn just looked into the camera and said: ‘Here’s Charlotte Hawkins.’ ‘She took over and did an amazing job. You couldn’t help but be impressed. I know Eamonn was,’ says a Sky insider. Though part of her job means having to join the celebrity carousel (such as attend a charity dance event laid on by Sky TV), she remains hearteningly down-to-earth. As for her personal life, Charlotte had been going out with Mark Herbert, now 40, a senior executive at drinks firm Pernod Ricard, for a decade before they married in 2008. The ceremony was at Chichester Cathedral (thanks to her vicar dad’s links), with the guests ferried to the reception in a specially decorated vintage red double-decker bus. ITV bosses are fearful that this week's expensive relaunch of their vital breakfast show will follow the earlier failure hosted by Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley . Home is a three-bedroom Fifties house in Surrey, which the couple bought for £700,000. Her husband wallpapered and fitted the bathrooms, while Charlotte painted the house herself. They had previously lived in a one-bedroom flat in Teddington, Middlesex. A comfortable existence then, but hardly Beverly Hills. One friend says: ‘Charlotte is a girly girl, not a big drinker. Anyway, with the ridiculously early hour she has to wake up in the morning, I can assure you she’s not out partying. ‘Sometimes, she’s a bit bewildered by any attention. Once, we were in a pub watching football on the TV when this bloke said to her: “Oh my  god! You’re that gorgeous girl off Sky.” ‘Charlotte just smiled, said hello  and then went back to watching the football. She prefers to live her life quietly and with a minimum of fuss.’ How different from Susanna Reid, who in recent months has been regular front-page news and celebrity magazine fodder following her split from her partner of 15 years, the father of her three children. Away from the studio, Charlotte enjoys cycling, horse-riding and going for long walks with her dog, a terrier cross called Bailey she adopted from an animal rescue centre. In the absence of children (though they have certainly not been ruled out), she dotes on him. Meanwhile, she spends much time concerned about the ailing health of her father, Francis, 77, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2011. With her apprenticeship alongside Eamonn Holmes, Charlotte sees herself as a natural No 2. But if audience reaction to Good Morning Britain is anything to go by, she could soon turn into a No 1. Even in this age when only pushy divas seem to rise to the top, Charlotte Hawkins has the innate talent to prove that theory wrong.","Critics are praising Charlotte Hawkins and her understated performance .

"Half of the experts urging the NHS to prescribe statins to millions more patients have financial ties to drugs firms making the pills. Six of the 12-strong panel have received thousands of pounds from manufacturers – either by being paid directly to give speeches or ‘advice’, or through funding for research. This includes the chairman, Dr Anthony Wierzbicki, who has been given funds likely to total tens of thousands of pounds from five drugs firms which make statins or similar cholesterol-lowering pills. Bitter pill: A group of leading doctors yesterday urged the NHS to scrap plans to massively increase the use of statins, like the pills pictured, warning that not enough was known about the risks they pose in the long term . Last night MPs urged the Health Secretary to launch an investigation into the panel’s links to drugs firms. Andrew Gwynne, Labour’s shadow health minister, said: ‘Neither big companies nor individuals should stand to personally profit from decisions about our care. Jeremy Hunt should launch an investigation without delay.’ A group of leading doctors yesterday urged the NHS to scrap plans to massively increase the use of statins, warning that not enough was known about the risks. NICE, the NHS drugs watchdog, is to issue new guidelines next month which are expected to urge GPs to prescribe statins to up to 10million extra patients to prevent heart disease. But doctors including the president of the Royal College of Physicians, Sir Richard Thompson, as well as senior cardiologists and GPs, warned that patients will be unnecessarily exposed to side-effects including diabetes, memory loss and muscle pain. They also accused NICE of only looking at potentially biased research about the benefits and risks of statins, which had been supplied by the manufacturers. Anthony Wierzbicki . Rajai Ahmad . Michael Khan . It has emerged that the chairman of the NICE panel which recommended the increased use of statins, Dr Wierzbicki, a consultant specialising in heart disease at Guys and St Thomas’ Hospital, London, has received thousands of pounds for his research from Sanofi, Amgen, Pfizer, Genzyme and MSD – which make statins or similar drugs. It is not known exactly how much he received but some doctors are given more than £10,000 in sponsorship for their research. And Dr Rajai Ahmad, who specialises in cardiology at Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals, has been paid by the firms MDS, Bayer and Boehringer Ingelheim to give lectures. Again, Dr Ahmad did not disclose the exact amount but manufacturers can pay medics more than £5,000 a year . And senior nurse Emma McGowan, who practises at University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, received a year’s salary from AstraZeneca who sponsored her job. This is likely to have been around £30,000 – a typical salary for a specialist nurse – although she is now directly paid by the hospitals. Emma McGowan . Dr Robert Dermot Neely . Alan Rees . Three other members of the group – Dr Robert Dermot Neely, Dr Alan Rees and Dr Michael Khan – all received sponsorship payments or travel expenses from drugs firms making statins. A group of senior doctors, including leading cardiologists and GPs, has now written to Mr Hunt and NICE urging them to reconsider the guidelines. Around 7million patients in Britain currently take statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes. They are predominantly given to the over-65s who have been diagnosed with heart disease or have a high risk of developing it based on their family history or lifestyle. But NICE’s new guidelines are likely to advise GPs to prescribe statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade. The Mail contacted all of the six experts on the panel but had not received responses last night. Chairman of panel; Consultant at Guys and St Thomas’ hospital, London. Has received research grants from Sanofi, Amgen, Pfizer, Genzyme and MSD which all either make statins or so-called new generation cholesterol-lowering drugs. Cardiologist at Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals. Has been paid by Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim and MSD to give speeches or offer advice. Specialises in cardiovascular disease at University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire. Has been paid by Genzyme and Amgen to offer advice. Senior nurse specialising in cardiovascular disease at University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire. The first year of her job at the hospital – from November 2010 to 2011 – was paid for by Astra Zeneca, one of the main statins manufacturers. She has also been paid by Merck, which also makes statins, to give speeches to nurses. Consultant at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle. Has been paid to give advice by Roche, Genzyme and Aegerion, which all make statins. He was also paid by Merck to attend a four-day conference in Milan in 2012. Consultant at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. Has been paid by MSD, AstraZeneca and Sanofi to attend meetings and give lectures. He also attended a dinner hosted by Abbott, another drugs giant which makes statins. All the experts had declared their conflicts of interest  to NICE. By DR MARTIN SCURR, Daily Mail doctor . Expert advice: First and foremost, all the experts agree that people who¿ve already had a heart attack or stroke should take a statin, says Dr Martin Scurr . Yet again statins, the cholesterol-lowering drugs, are headline news. Yesterday a group of respected doctors warned that a proposal by the NHS to give statins to millions of otherwise healthy people would be a mistake. Their view is that the drugs could do more harm than good – and their concern is that the recommendation to extend the drugs’ use is based on flawed and biased data about the side-effects. So while NICE (the National Institute for Care Excellence) wants more of us to take statins because of the benefits, leading doctors are very much against this because of the side-effects. Confused? No wonder – even doctors find it hard to make sense of the conflicting information about statins. But this is what I’ll be telling my patients. First and foremost, all the experts agree that people who’ve already had a heart attack or stroke should take a statin. This is known as ‘secondary prevention’ – statins guard against a second such event. Indeed, statins are one of the key reasons why life expectancy now is so much better than when I entered medicine. For any patient who has been through such an event, statins are life-saving. Keep taking them. But there is a world of difference between this secondary prevention and ‘primary prevention’ – and this is where things become controversial. Primary prevention is where healthy people are given a treatment – it could be a statin, or low-dose aspirin – to prevent a future event: in the case of statins, that is the furring up of the arteries in the heart or brain, which could lead to a heart attack, stroke or perhaps dementia. So who should be taking statins as primary prevention? The draft guidance from NICE is that any healthy person with a 10 per cent risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade should be on a statin. Currently it’s those with a 20 per cent risk who get the drug. Doctors calculate your percentage risk by adding up your risk factors, such as a history of smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, having a close relative (a parent or sibling) who has had a heart attack and high cholesterol. It is not an exact calculation, though it’s a handy tool. Under the new NICE guidance the majority of people aged over 50 would now be on a statin, and this is what is so controversial. So if you fall into this group, should you now be taking a statin or not? This is where you need the clear, intelligent advice from a doctor you know and trust. What you don’t need is a knee-jerk prescription from a doctor following imposed rules. And if your doctor says to take a statin, even if you’re aren’t sure, at least try it for two to three months. The fact is that most people suffer no side-effects and their cholesterol levels plummet, which is reassuring, like wearing a seatbelt. But nothing – NICE guidelines or prescription pills – can ever be as effective in primary prevention as taking the right lifestyle precautions: don’t smoke, keep to a healthy weight and exercise every single day. That will put paid to the statin debate.","Six of the 12-strong NICE panel have received money from drugs makers .

"At the age of 13, Megan Worrall thought nothing of jumping on a sunbed to take the last few minutes of her mother's session. When she was younger, her mother had been diagnosed with psoriasis and believed using sunbeds would help her skin condition. Lured by the glamorous pictures of tanned women on the walls of the sunbed salon, Miss Worrall believed two sessions a week was good for her health, helping boost her vitamin D levels. But six years later while watching Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies, the then 19-year-old realised the dangers, noticing changes to a mole on her leg. Scroll down for video . Megal Worrall, from Liverpool, first started using sunbeds when she was 13 years old, jumping on for the last few minutes of her mother's sessions . The naturally pale-skinned and freckly teenager was referred to a dermatologist, who removed the mole along - leaving a 9cm scar - with another on her stomach, before giving her the devastating diagnosis. Miss Worrall had the most deadly form of skin cancer, melanoma, which can spread quickly to other parts of the body. Today the 22-year-old is in remission and is an ardent critic of sunbeds, urging young people to opt for safer, fake tanning products. She has shunned sunbeds for the last years, and now shelters under umbrellas while on holiday to avoid the midday sun. She told This Morning: 'My mum was diagnosed with psoriasis when she was younger. 'She was in hospital for six weeks and was treated with sunbeds and so we thought they were beneficial. 'When I was younger I would jump on for the last few minutes of her sessions. 'Sunbed . salons are full of pictures of beautiful women on the walls, it implies . there are health benefits and there is lots of advertising saying . vitamin D is good for your health. But Miss Worrall told This Morning, six years later, when she was 19 she was diagnosed with melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer . 'We don't get much sun here so I thought it was totally beneficial.' In 2005, when Miss Worrall was just 13, it . was illegal for anyone under the age of 16 to use a sunbed. Today the . age limit has been raised and it is currently illegal for anyone under . the age of 18 to use one. But Miss Worrall said she never had a problem persuading staff in sunbed shops that she was old enough. While people questioned her age, they took her word for it that she was over 16. By the time she was 16, Miss Worrall was regularly using sunbeds at least twice a week. And she said, many of her peers at school were jumping on the sunbed wagon. 'Lots of the boys at school suffered acne and so would go on sunbeds to clear their skin up,' the now 22-year-old said. 'Coming into school burned, and saying we had been on a sunbed, which you had to be 16 to go on, was almost a badge of honour.' But . for Miss Worrall, who naturally has pale skin dotted with freckles and . moles, the years of exposure to harmful UV rays took its toll. Miss Worrall first noticed changes to a mole on her left leg, after watching Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies show where a woman was discussing her case of skin cancer . At the age of 19, Miss Worrall had two moles removed, one from her left leg leaving a 9cm scar (pictured), and another from her stomach . Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. There are two types - melanoma, which spreads very quickly in the body, and non-melanoma, which is more common. Melanoma is a rare and serious type of cancer, which begins in the skin and spreads to other organs in the body. A new mole or a change in an existing mole is a typical sign of skin cancer. This can happen anywhere on the body, but most often on the legs, back, arms and face. Around 13,300 people in the UK are diagnosed with melanoma each year. It is the fifth most common cancer overall in the country, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. The number of people being diagnosed with melanoma is four times higher than it was 30 years ago. Exposure to ultraviolet light increases a person's risk of developing melanoma. The more moles a person has on their body, the higher their risk of developing the disease. Those with a lot of moles and freckly skin should be very careful in the sun. Having fair skin and a tendency to get sunburn will also increase a person's risk. Source: NHS Choices and Cancer Research UK . At the age of 19, when she was watching an episode of Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies, Miss Worrall realised there were dangers associated with using sunbeds. 'The doctor was talking to a girl, and he pointed out the ABC theory - asymmetry, border and colour,' she said. 'I noticed a change on one of my moles on my leg and thought I had to go to the doctors. 'I was referred to a dermatologist who told me I would have to have the mole removed.' She added: 'They called me early with my results so I had an idea something was wrong. 'You hope for the best but expect the worst, but even then I didn't expect skin cancer at 19.' Today . the 22-year-old is in remission but faces regular check-ups with her . dermatologist to check for any more changes on her body. The ordeal has changed Miss Worrall's life for ever. For three years she has shunned sunbeds, opting for spray tans instead. And when she is in natural sunlight on . holiday, the 22-year-old uses factor 50 suncream and sits under . umbrellas, avoiding the midday sun. She is urging young people to avoid using sunbeds, instead opting for fake tan alternatives. Dr . Chris Steele, This Morning's resident doctor who himself had skin cancer twice as a result of using . sunbeds 40 years ago before the dangers were widely known, said melanoma . is detectable and more importantly preventable. He urged people to watch out for changes . to moles and freckles on their skin, watching for a change in size and . colour, checking whether moles feel itchy, are bleeding or flaking. The 22-year-old is now in remission and is urging other young people not to use harmful sunbeds, raising awareness of the dangers they pose . A recent . survey by Cancer Research UK found people in Liverpool are at highest . risk of being diagnosed with skin cancer, with 40 per cent of people . admitting they use sunbeds at least once a week. Gary . Lipman, chair of the Sunbed Association told This Morning: 'The survey . was undertaken soon after the law banning sunbed use by under 18s and . the legislation has had a positive impact on underage use. 'Sunbed salons are full of pictures of . beautiful women on the walls, it implies there are health benefits and . there is lots of advertising saying vitamin D is good for your health' - Megan Worrall . 'Our code of practice prohibits underage use as just one element of the screening process. 'Properly trained staff offer customers information about responsible use.' Past surveys by Cancer Research UK in 2012 and 2009 linked sunbed use to an increased risk of getting skin cancer. In 2012, an analysis of 27 studies revealed people have an increase in risk if they have ever used a sunbed. And the risk was highest for people who used a sunbed before the age of 35. The 2009 study found people who have regularly used a sunbed before the age of 30 have a 75 per cent increase in their risk of developing melanoma.","Megan Worrall first used sunbeds when she was just 13 years old .

"ISIS supporters have been handing out leaflets to  Oxford Street shoppers encouraging them to leave Britain for its new Islamic state. The radicals stood in front of posters declaring 'the dawn of a new era has begun' in reference to the caliphate and their literature praised the 'sacrifices' made in the Middle East. Scotland Yard has said today it is investigating whether the men were breaking terror laws. Scroll down for video . Propaganda: ISIS supporters have been handing out leaflets to Oxford Street shopper encouraging them to leave Britain for Syria and Iraq . Rules: The literature sets out how people should live their lives and encourages them to leave Britain for the caliphate . One Muslim woman who confronted the men, believed to be from Luton and linked to hate preachers Anjem Choudary and Omar Bakri, said she was racially abused. Asmaa Al-kufaishi, tweeted: 'This group are promoting ISIS on Oxford Street. Racially abused us when we spoke out. They don’t know Islam. 'Promoting death of innocent people, telling me to die because of my faith and race and insulting me is not Islamic behaviour.' Pictures of the men and their leaflets have spread across social media. The literature describes the 'glad tidings' that 'Muslims with the help of Allah have announced the re-establishment of the Khilafah (sic) and appointed an imam as a Khaleef (sic).' It also sets out seven rules for supporters, including to 'obey' the leaders of ISIS, Sharia law, 'migrate' from the UK to the caliphate and 'expose lies' about the extremist group. Today, ISIS, which now styles itself simply Islamic State (IS), has become a powerful military force that now has control of an area larger than Great Britain. Its extremists - which include hundreds of Britain - have carried out such acts of such extreme brutality that Al Qaeda has severed all links with them. Anger: Shoppers on Oxford Street confronted the men and a Muslim woman said she was racially abused . The leafleting yesterday has led to calls for police action. A Met spokesman said: 'The MPS has been made aware, via social media, of leaflets which reports state were being distributed in the Oxford Street area. We are assessing the content of the leaflets to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed'. Ghaffar Hussain, managing director of the anti-extremism foundation Quilliam, said it is a 'clear breach of the law'. 'This is a very disturbing development but one that should not come as a surprise since we are aware that around 500 British nationals have joined up with ISIS already. 'We need to have a zero tolerance policy towards ISIS supporters and recruiters in the UK.' The ISIS ‘caliphate’ – or Islamic state – stretches across wartorn Syria and Iraq. The terrorist group say it represents the biggest shift in the political geography of the Middle East since  the borders of the two countries were drawn under the Sykes-Picot agreement drafted between Britain and France in 1916. For some extremist organisations a caliphate is considered a utopian concept rather than a reality, but ISIS believe it is something to be fought for and established. As well as claiming it as a nation, and giving it a leader, ISIS has also taken over basic public services such as collecting rubbish, taxes, enforcing Sharia law, and replacing Imams in bigger cities with their own Imams etc. Law and order is enforced by deterrence. They have public show trials where defendants get publicly lashed or executed. Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security analyst at King's College London in Qatar, told MailOnline: 'With limited forces available to administer the country, the local population could probably cause major problems if they rose up against ISIS. 'ISIS control is very fragile as people only co-operate due to fear not because they want to. Just because they have seized territory from official statutory power, it does not make them a statutory power. 'But they are learning and if there are able over the coming months and years to consolidate their power, they might be able to erect a quasi-regime loosely keeping all those territories together.'","Central London shoppers were encouraged to 'resettle' in Syria and Iraq .

"Facebook, owned by Mark Zuckerberg, has been accused of 'refusing to listen' to the voice of the British public . Facebook 'refused to listen to the voice' of the British public by channelling profits through Ireland to avoid  the taxman in the UK, an MP said last night. The move by the social network meant it paid just £1.8million in Irish tax on more than £2.3billion of global sales, but none in Britain. The accusation came as details of the social network's efforts to avoid paying UK tax emerged, just days after Chancellor George Osborne announced a crackdown on multinational companies using 'elaborate structures' to avoid paying up. Around 46 per cent (£2.35billion) of Facebook's global sales where channelled through Ireland - allowing the company to make profits of £2.3billion. Its tax bill was reduced further by paying £2.29billion in 'administrative expenses' to Facebook's parent company, The Guardian reported. Shifting the money meant Mark Zuckerberg's company only paid the equivalent of £1.81million in Irish tax on taxable profits of £5.76million. By channelling its UK sales through Ireland, Facebook has avoided paying any tax in Britain for two years running - despite 33 million Brits having accounts. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said Facebook was 'still refusing to listen to the voice of public opinion'. She added that the social network appeared to be 'using elaborate corporate structures and artificial devices for no purpose other than to avoid tax'. Ms Hodge said: 'We have to take tough to crack down on this behaviour, and the UK should be leading the way on this issue.' The UK boss of Starbucks, which has only paid £8.6m tax despite making £3billion in British sales since it first opened its doors in 1998, also admitted this week that it would not start paying corporation tax for the next three years. Google paid £20m in UK tax last year despite its British revenue totalling £5.6billion. Facebook paid just £1.8million in tax on more than £2.3billion of advert sales channelled through Ireland, avoiding the UK taxman for the second year running . Chancellor George Osborne, in his Autumn Statement on Wednesday, announced a measure, dubbed the 'Google tax', which will impose a 25 per cent levy on profits shifted abroad by multinational companies. It is hoped that the measure will raise more than £1billion over the next five years. He said: 'Some of the largest companies in the world, including those in the tech sector, use elaborate structures to avoid paying taxes. 'That's not fair to other British firms. It's not fair to British people either. Today we're putting a stop to it. My message is consistent and clear: low taxes, but low taxes that will be paid.' Facebook have been contacted for comment.","Facebook paid £1.8million in Irish tax on more than £2.3billion global sales .

"When mother-of-two Claire Craig noticed a numb, tingling sensation in the fingers of her right hand, she never dreamed it could be something serious. 'We'd just got a puppy who was  nipping a bit, and I assumed he'd caught a nerve in my hand,' says  Claire, 41, an interior designer from Surbiton, Surrey. 'I forgot about it, but then, over the next three months, it got worse. My whole hand was numb. It was like I was wearing a thick ski glove. While driving, I didn't feel I could hold the steering wheel properly.' Claire's GP suspected carpal tunnel syndrome - when the nerve in the hand becomes compressed - but  tests came back clear, so an MRI scan was ordered. Claire had a tumour on her brain. She is here with husband Tony and children Jemima, 8 (l) and Matilda, 12 . In the months before her scan appointment, her symptoms escalated. 'The numbness had gone right down my leg by now and it felt  like lead - I had to pull it up the stairs,' says Claire, who is married to Anthony, a deputy headteacher, and who has two daughters, Matilda, now 12, and Jemima, eight, plus a stepson, George, 19. 'But I still didn't think it was anything serious as I didn't have any  other symptoms - no headaches  or dizziness. 'Even after they did the MRI and called me back urgently for another one because they'd found a “spot” on my brain, I remained calm. I don't think I quite took  it in.' The morning after her second MRI scan, Claire received a phone call from the hospital. There was a tumour the size of a small aubergine on her brain. 'Cancer never occurred to me,' she recalls today, four years later. 'I was 36, I had two young children and in the space of a few days my life had changed for ever.' Medical advances in recent decades have transformed our knowledge of many cancers. But for brain tumours, which claim around 3,400 lives every year in England and Wales, we are badly lagging behind. Cancer never occurred to her. She was just 36 . The symptoms are vague and variable, and little is known about the causes or risk factors. Worryingly, no one can fully explain why, unlike most other conditions, the number of cases is rising. 'The detection rate is getting better, but even given that, there has been a jump in the numbers above what we might expect,'  says Kevin O'Neill, a neurosurgeon at Charing Cross Hospital, London. Since 1970, the incidence of brain cancer in the UK has risen by 23 per cent in men and 25 per cent in women, according to  the charity Brain Tumour Research Campaign. There's also been a rise in secondary brain tumours, which occur when cells from another cancer - such as a breast cancer - spread to the brain. Between 20 and 40 per cent of cancers eventually spread to the brain - most commonly in patients who have had breast, lung, bowel and skin cancer. Experts say not enough is being spent on research, meaning prognosis remains poor; sadly,  58 per cent of people diagnosed with brain cancer die within a year, compared with 5 per cent for breast cancer and 7 per cent for prostate cancer. Part of the problem is that brain tumours, by the nature of their location, are hard to reach. Indeed, Claire's surgeon told her he would not know for sure what kind of tumour she had until he had begun operating on it. 'He told me there were two possible types: one was non-recurring, the other terminal,' she says. 'My husband, Tony, and I dealt with it in very different ways. For me, it could only be the good type of tumour and there was no option of me not coming through this. 'Tony felt he had to prepare himself for the worst outcome.' Claire's tumour was on her brain stem - the region at the back of the brain that connects it to the spinal cord. There was a high risk the operation itself would cause paralysis, but Claire had no choice. Without treatment, she could have been dead within a year. 'The three weeks before the operation in March 2009 were the worst of my life,' she says. 'We told the girls that Mummy had an egg in her head and had to have it taken out. They were only three and seven at the time, but they've since told me how frightened they were.' Claire's surgeon predicted the operation would take four to five hours - it took nine. 'It was a lot deeper and bigger than they'd thought, so they had to cut through a lot of my nerve tissue,' she says. 'When I woke up, I was paralysed down one side.' In the following weeks and months, Claire fought to regain the use of her right-hand side, slowly learning to walk, talk and eat again. After one month, she went home to her family. Tests showed that her tumour was a hemangioblastoma - a rare, but benign, type. One year after the operation, scans showed the tumour hadn't returned. Two years ago, she was told to go away and live her life as if it had never happened. 'I was cured, and not many people with brain tumours can say that,' she says. Incredibly, she has suffered few long-term problems, apart from some numbness and weakness. 'It's mainly affected my small motor skills, so I can't sew a button on very quickly or hold two mugs with one hand, for example. And I can't wear court shoes,  ballet pumps or anything without support because I can't flex  my foot to keep the shoe on,'  she says. Claire's outcome is an astonishing one in a field of medicine that is notoriously complex. 'What causes brain tumours is the $64,000 question,' says neurosurgeon Kevin O'Neill. 'There is a relative peak in childhood and another in late middle age, but apart from that, we don't know any absolute risk factors.' Tests showed that her tumour was a hemangioblastoma - a rare, but benign, type . espite fears that mobile phones cause brain tumours, the evidence does not suggest any link. There's a risk of misdiagnosis because the condition is rare, and its symptoms - such as headache - are similar to many other, less serious illnesses. 'A headache is very unlikely to be due to a brain tumour, but if it is persistent and unrelenting, alters when you change position, and is associated with nausea, visual disturbance, numbness and weakness, it's worth having it checked.' Brain tumours cannot be treated with chemotherapy because of the blood-brain barrier - a natural protective blockade that stops drugs from getting into the brain from the bloodstream. Surgery is often the first option, but this carries risks. 'Because of where they are, brain tumours are hard to remove without injuring the patient,' says Mr O'Neill. 'Also peculiar to them is that they can be made up of different groups of cells which behave in different ways, making them difficult to see and take out. 'So whatever treatment you apply, some tumour cells may be left behind. 'But options are improving - we are starting to use 3D technology to create a picture of the tumour so that during surgery we can see which cells are tumour and which are normal brain.' Certainly, experts hope that in the future we will hear more success stories such as Claire's. She says it took several months after her operation to start to make sense of what happened. 'I suppose I used to think I was invincible. This made me realise we're not in charge,' she says.

"As Berenice was wheeled into surgery to have her right breast removed, she felt no nerves - just relief that she would no longer worry about dying of cancer. This would be understandable had the 58-year-old's breast been afflicted with the disease - but it was healthy. While the mother-of-two had been diagnosed with an aggressive tumour in her left breast, which she had removed in October 2009 after chemotherapy, her right breast was unaffected. Double mastectomies: Tonni Pease, left, was only 25 when she had her breasts removed, while Clare Mohan, right, didn't wait to be tested for the faulty gene that can cause cancer before taking the step . Berenice Cowan was tested for the faulty BRCA genes, which put carriers at high risk of breast cancer, but thankfully the results were negative. However, in the months after surgery, she was plagued with worry about the cancer returning and became convinced that having her healthy breast removed was the right thing to do. 'I thought about it every day and was constantly checking for a lump,' says Berenice, who is married to Ian, 60. They have two sons, Paul, 31, and Marc, 23. 'I didn't tick any of the boxes for cancer, such as drinking, smoking, being overweight - yet I still got it. So why couldn't I get it again?' Berenice is not alone. She is one of a growing number of women choosing to have double  mastectomies even though they don't need them. Some regrets: Clare, pictured pre-op, now wishes she gave it more thought . A quarter of women who develop cancer in one breast now ask for both to be removed, according to figures from the London Breast Institute. Some . people I told thought I was mad and couldn't understand why I wanted . the breast gone . Experts say the surge is due in part to the influence of actress Angelina Jolie, who earlier this year had a preventative double mastectomy after discovering she had the faulty BRCA1 gene. Yet many women requesting double mastectomies do not carry such a gene, and have a much smaller chance of cancer in the unaffected breast. Doctors have warned that the 'Jolie-effect' means women may be putting their health at risk, and some may suffer scarring or psychological issues as a result of  having both their breasts removed unnecessarily. Better safe than sorry: Berenice had her healthy right breast removed because she feared cancer . Yet many women who push for the . surgery - often against the advice of doctors - feel the peace of mind . they gain is worth the risk. 'Some . people I told thought I was mad and couldn't understand why I wanted . the breast gone - but it was important to me,' says Berenice, who lives . in Cheadle, Cheshire. She says she was petrified at the thought of . receiving another cancer diagnosis, and of more chemotherapy, which had . caused hair loss and crushing fatigue - yet her doctor was unwilling to . put her forward for surgery. 'My doctors wouldn't do it,' she says. 'They said they couldn'’t just remove healthy tissue and that I'd feel differently in two years. But I knew I wouldn't.' She also struggled with her new shape. 'I didn’t feel ready for reconstruction, and so I was left with one normal breast and one prosthesis. They didn’t match, and I was always uncomfortable.' She brought it up with a different consultant during a check-up last year and found him more sympathetic. In October last year, she had the surgery. 'It's the best thing I've done,' she says. 'It's just such a weight off my mind.' Berenice chose not to have a reconstruction, and now uses prostheses - or nothing at all. 'I do ballet, and when I go to classes I just wear my leotard; on holiday I wear a ruched bikini. 'I feel just as feminine, and my husband says I look beautiful.' While Berenice opted not to have a reconstruction, some doctors believe improvements in reconstructive surgery are a factor in encouraging more women to have healthy breasts removed. Lester Barr, consultant breast surgeon and chairman of Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention, says: 'Women are less afraid of mastectomies than they were in the past. More women are surviving than ever before, and those survivors are afraid of developing a second cancer.' So many are requesting their healthy breasts removed that Genesis recently looked into the reasons. The most common reasons among those without a faulty gene were anxiety about being diagnosed again, the stress of chemotherapy, and wanting symmetrical breasts after reconstruction. 'As long as the decision is made after careful thought, my view is it is logical,' says Mr Barr. Age risks . The biggest risk factor for breast cancer (other than gender) is age - 81 per cent occur in women over 50 . 'The only people we dissuade are those with a very low risk of cancer in the opposite breast - for example, a woman with a low- risk cancer who isin her 60s or 70s. It doesn’t make sense at that age.' Whatever the circumstances, it’s never an easy decision to make. Tonni Pease, 26, was diagnosed with breast cancer in April last year, when her daughter Matilda was just 10 months old. 'The doctors recommended a mastectomy,' says Tonni who lives with her husband Jason, 28, and Matilda, now two, in King's Lynn, Norfolk. 'We decided I’d also be tested for faulty genes, because my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer at 43.' No worries: Berenice, pictured with her husband, said the operation means she no longer lives in fear of breast cancer . But the results didn’t come back before her surgery, so Tonni made the brave choice to have both breasts removed, just in case. 'If I had the faulty gene, I’d need a double mastectomy and I couldn't face surgery again,' she says. 'I thought I must have the gene, because Mum had it and because I'd got cancer so young. My mum had a single mastectomy and was constantly worried it was going to come back on the other side. I didn't want to go through that. 'It was awful, though. I couldn't have reconstructive surgery done straight away as I had to have radiotherapy first. Role model: But Angelina Jolie's mastectomy could be dangerously misleading since not everyone can afford the best reconstructive surgery . 'I was only 25 and I’d lost both my breasts - I thought I’d never look the same. I also worried what Jason would think, but he’s always been totally supportive.' In a cruel twist of fate, after she'd had her double mastectomy, the genetic test results came back showing Tonni was not a carrier. 'I was relieved for my daughter and sister,' says Tonni, 'but I made the right decision. I did what I could to see my little girl grow up.' Surgeon Professor Kefah Mokbel at the London Breast Institute says doctors must ensure women are well informed about the risks. 'In general, a doctor will do what the patient wants, but it’s important we explain that they may not benefit in terms of survival. 'That's because if they do go on to get cancer in the other breast, the likelihood is it will be picked up earlier than the first cancer. 'They must also be made aware of the psychosexual effect a mastectomy can have. It should only be done after careful consideration.' Clare Mohan is one woman who wishes she’d given more thought to undergoing an elective double mastectomy in March 2010. She watched as breast cancer struck three of her aunts, and then her mother in 2004. Tests showed her mother carried the faulty BRCA2 gene. Clare didn't want to wait to be tested herself, and had both her breasts removed. 'I couldn't let my daughters go through what I'd been through, and I wanted to show them there was a way to protect yourself,' says Clare, 32, who lives in Erdington, Birmingham, and is mother to Demi, ten, and Libby, four. Clare had surgery in March 2010, but suffered complications and had to have a further operation which left her disfigured. She now suffers with terrible pain from scar tissue and has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Preventative: Tonni said her mastectomy was the right decision so she can see her little girl grow up . 'I now worry my daughters will never want to do what I did because they've seen how it affected me. 'Women really need to think about what they’re doing. Look at the surgeon who’ll be doing the operation and take the counselling you’re offered beforehand . 'I really don’t think anyone should do it unless it's absolutely necessary.' Clare warns the publicity around Angelina Jolie's mastectomy could be dangerously misleading. 'Her breasts look brilliant, but she has got the money to spend on it. Not everyone will look like her.' But for women like Berenice, the risks are outweighed by feeling she has protected herself from a life-threatening disease. 'When I was told I had cancer, I felt like I'd been thrown into a black hole. I thought about not living to see my grandchildren. 'I don't ever want to have to experience that again.'

"A broke former footballer who masqueraded as Chelsea player Gael Kakuta in order to fund a luxury lifestyle of champagne, women, fast cars and shopping sprees was jailed for four years today. Medi Abalimba, 24, was once a promising star, earning up to £4,000 a weeks and was once s old to Derby County for £1.2million and. But his career bombed after he struggled to recover from an injury. Unwilling to give up his celebrity life, he began breaking into lockers at the private health club in Camden where he was a member, in order to steal credit card details. He would then go on spending sprees in luxury shops, five-star hotels and trendy nightclubs pretending to be Kakuta, while using the card details to pay. Medi Abalimba, 24 (left), has been jailed for four years after duping bars, restaurants, luxury stores and five-star hotels out of thousands of pounds by pretending to be Chelsea player Gael Kakuta . During one incident he duped starstruck staff into running up a £25,000 bar tab on Cristal champagne in one London club  claiming 'he was a Premier League star and good for the money.' He also ran up a £12,000 bill at three luxury London hotels, took a bar in Manchester for another £5,000, scrounged suites in luxury apartment complexes and spent £11,000 on limousines. On another occasion he took four star-struck girls from Manchester on a £1,100 helicopter tour over London before having them stay with him at an £800-a-night rented mansion in Berkshire, which he falsely claimed was his home. He also used another woman’s credit cards to rack up a £4,633 bill at a spa and to hire a Range Rover at a cost of £2,397. Abalimba took four girls on a £1,100 helicopter ride over London, before inviting them back to a £800-a-night mansion in Berkshire, saying it was his home . Abalimba was caught after he attempted to buy clothing worth more than £20,000 from Selfridge's at the Trafford Centre near Manchester - even practising his football skills inside while browsing. After being arrested, he claimed his one-time massive weekly wage left him with a 'wholly unrealistic' understanding of money. Abalimba was born in the Congo and had begun his career as a midfielder in the youth teams of Crystal Palace and Fulham, before moving to Southend United where he was paid £1,000 a week at just 16 years old. He attracted attention from several Premier League clubs early in his career and was given trials at Manchester United and Manchester City. At Liverpool, he played for the reserves while the then manager Rafa Benitez watched from the stands and eventually signed for Derby County in 2009 for £1.2million. He was paid £4,000 a week and received an appearance fee of £1,000 as a substitute, and £2,000 for starting a match. But his career was curtailed by injury and he was sent to Oldham Athletic on a free transfer in January 2011 having failed to make a competitive appearance. In August 2012 he was signed by Farnborough Town with a wage of just £300 a week and was forced to supplement his income with part-time work as a taxi firm controller. Fearing his friends would dump him, he turned to fraud in order to keep up the illusion of wealth. He called venues in advance, pretending to be Kakuta’s agent and advising them of his imminent arrival before using 'compromised' credit cards to pay for goods and services. He took friends for a night out in London where he duped staff at the Cirque du Soir burlesque club in Soho into giving him champagne after convincing them he had put his credit card behind the bar. When a waiter could not find the card, Abalimba said he was a Premier League footballer and showed the server photos of himself posing in football shirts with Premier League stars. He then racked up the five-figure bar tab entertaining a table of 10 guests, buying bottles of champagne which cost up to £5,000 each - even offering to buy bubbly for a man at the next table. In all he ordered two jeroboams of Cristal, each equivalent to four regular bottles, and used a microphone to invite the entire club back to his house for a party. The failed footballer ran up a bill of £8,000 in the acclaimed Gilgamesh Bar and Lounge (pictured), treating 20 of his friends to dinner . Mandarin hotel in London was also conned out of £3,000 by Abalimba, who pretended to be Gael Kakuta while using stolen credit card details . At the end of the night, it was discovered he could not pay the bill and police arrived to arrest him. At the time he claimed he had been given a credit card by his French football club but was given a six-month suspended sentence. Just months later he phoned a trendy club in Manchester and put on an American accent, pretended to be the agent for Gael Kakuta and asked for a table. The Corinthia hotel was left £7,000 out of pocket by Abalimba, who cannot repay any of his debts because the court heard he has nothing left . Throughout the the evening he posed as Kakuta to order champagne worth £2,600. At the end of the night claimed he had left his wallet in a limousine and told staff he had his credit card details over the phone. The payment, made using stolen credit card details, was authorised and Abalimba then pre-paid more than £2,000, telling staff he would return. The next night he drank champagne with friends before leaving in a chauffeur driven Bentley GT. Last July Abalimba went to Selfridges in the Trafford Centre where he chose more than £20,000 worth of clothing only to claim he could not pay with his credit card as it had been damaged. He later phoned the store to try and make a payment over the phone using the stolen credit card details. But just as a chauffeur was sent to collect the goods, a store detective became suspicious and withheld the items. Police traced Abalimba to a mansion where he had been staying and he later told police he regularly broke into lockers at a sports club in Camden using master keys,  and used his phone to photograph members’ credit card details. It emerged that in London he ran up huge bills during hotel stays, including £7,000 at the Corinthia hotel, £3,000 at Mandarin, £2,000 at Millennium Hotel and £1,400 at Bulgari Hotel. Officers found his fingerprints on a pair of Harvey Nichols shoes the fraudster had attempted to give out as a tip. He also enjoyed drinks at several nightclubs and restaurants including the acclaimed Gilgamesh, run by head chef Ian Pengelley, where he ran up a bill of £8,000 for 20 of his friends. In Manchester he deceived hotels including Park Inn, Worsley Marriott and the Great John St Hotel. He also attempted to book £4,206 worth of rooms at The Midland but was thwarted by extra security checks by staff there. He also tried to fraudulently obtain a £9,000 Rolex watch from a jeweller. On one of his many trips to London, Abalimba spent £2,000 at Millennium Hotel (left and right) on phony cards . At Manchester Crown Court, Abalimba, who is currently living in west London admitted three charges of fraud, taking a Range Rover without consent and making off without paying for £104 worth of petrol and asked for 19 other offences to be considered. After the case Sgt Adam Cronshaw of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Having spoken with many of the victims in this case it appears that Abalimba is a charming and charismatic individual who was able to call on his previous football experience and the fact he bears some resemblance to the real Gael Kakuta to deceive them. 'He was able to trick most people he came across and grew in confidence the longer the charade continued. He became so skilled in lies and deceit that his character went from being plausible to unquestionable. Abalimba was caught after trying to buy £20,000 worth of goods at Selfridges in the Trafford Centre (pictured) Abalimba gave the store his card details over the phone, but just as a chauffeur was sent to collect the items, store security became suspicious and withheld the items . 'Abalimba told us that many of his victims treated him so differently because they thought he was a celebrity footballer. Unfortunately this trust and goodwill was misplaced. 'While I have some sympathy for the way his career was curtailed, there can be no excuses for the persistent and deliberate frauds that have left numerous people and businesses out of pocket. 'I’m glad we were able to catch him and prevent further loss to other potential victims as he showed no signs of halting his activity. 'I hope more businesses are now aware of this scam and have the necessary security measures in place to prevent similar occurrences.' Police said the latest frauds totalled £163,000 but with no assets or cash to his name there is no opportunity for financial compensation to be paid to victims. Abalimba once ran up a £25,000 bar tab in a London club, buying two jeroboams of Cristal champagne, telling bar staff he was 'good for the money (pictured, Abalimba is arrested)","Medi Abalimba, 24, once earned £4,000-a-week as a promising footballer .

"Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said he wanted to keep the 'menace' of high-risk offenders off the road . The chances of a pedestrian being killed or seriously injured varies dramatically according to what part of the country they are in, it emerged yesterday. In some areas, the risk is nearly three times greater than in others, leading to what campaigners have described as a ‘deadly postcode lottery’. The most dangerous areas are Merseyside, the West Midlands and Lancashire, with 14 deaths per 100,000 people. For those who live in Warwickshire and Suffolk, however, the number is 5 per 100,000, or fewer. According to Department for Transport data from 2011 – the most recent available – a total of 5,907 pedestrians were killed or seriously injured on Britain’s roads. Yet while politicians have pointed to an overall reduction in road deaths, the number of pedestrian casualties is on the increase. Phillipa Hunt, of the campaign group Living Streets, said the ‘deplorable 6 per cent increase in the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured in road traffic collisions’ is a ‘shocking reflection of the state of pedestrian safety in Britain’. The reasons for the large variation are not clear. Some variation according to the density of population might be expected, but some areas with similar geography have very different rates. The metropolitan area of Greater Manchester is markedly safer than the most dangerous postcodes. London, with far and away the largest number of vehicles on the road, comes in at number five on the list – with pedestrians 10 per cent safer than in Merseyside. The shock figures have led to calls for a total overhaul of the Government’s approach. Living Streets’ Director of Policy and Communications, Phillipa Hunt, said: ‘These figures are a shocking reflection of the state of pedestrian safety in Britain. 'We are all pedestrians and should be able to walk on our streets safely regardless of where we live. 'The deplorable 6% increase in the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured in road traffic collisions, reported last month, calls for bold and proven measures at both national and local level.’ Amy Aeron-Thomas, the director of Roadpeace, said: ‘Britain’s poor pedestrian record is well-known but it is shocking to learn just how variable it is across the country. 'Walking is the basic travel mode for the most vulnerable in our society. They deserve extra protection not extra risk. The risk of a pedestrian being killed or seriously injured is nearly three times greater in Merseyside than it is in Warwickshire . ‘If the police treated road crime as real crime they would make it a priority to better understand the crashes and casualty rates on their streets. This is essential for the prevention of road crime and the protection of life, the key aim of policing.’ The authorities have also been criticised for failing to collate the data themselves. The research was compiled by an independent statistician, Ian Campbell, who was alarmed by the lack of a coherent approach to road safety in the UK, which he described as a ‘policy vacuum’. No monitoring of rates by police area is carried out by the Department for Transport, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Local Government Association or Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary. Mr Campbell said: ‘The total number of casualties has been falling for years, and this is often referred to by those in authority. But have roads really got safer? ‘We don’t know how much of the fall is due to pedestrians being scared to travel on foot and so walking less; or how much it is due to car manufacturers making their cars safer for the drivers. ‘There does not seem to have been a review of all the evidence. So should those in authority be claiming any credit for declines that have occurred? ‘They collect information relating to car crime, but this is about theft, not the very real risk of death or serious injury.’ Campaigners have long been calling for a blanket 20mph limit in built up areas, pointing to evidence that this reduces child pedestrian deaths by 70 per cent. Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘Britain has some of the safest roads in the world but we know that one death is one too many. ‘Local councils have the knowledge and experience needed to manage their roads effectively and to help them do this we have published new guidance on how to implement speed limits as well as making it easier for them to introduce 20 mph zones where this is appropriate. ‘To help further reduce casualties we are taking action to streamline enforcement of drink driving and have proposed an increase in the fixed penalty for using a mobile at the wheel as well as measures to make easier for the police to enforce against careless drivers. ‘We are also continuing to run our award winning THINK! road safety campaigns and are working with schools and local councils to make sure important road safety messages are reaching children and teenagers to help them stay safe.’ 1.

"Night after night, Barbara Paul would lie staring at her ceiling through the small hours of the morning. Sometimes the 63-year-old would recite the alphabet to herself over and over in an attempt to drop off, but it rarely worked. Of course, surviving on as little as two hours’ sleep a night had a profound impact. ‘I began to dread bedtime, knowing what lay ahead. I felt so frustrated and it became hard to cope,’ she says. Scroll down for video . Barbara Paul, 63, would survive on as little as two hours of sleep a night . Insomnia is a devastating condition that affects up to 30 per cent of people, but there’s a little-known trigger that causes it in women such as Barbara: the menopause. Alongside hot flushes, memory loss and mood swings, sleeplessness is a surprising side-effect of the change, and one that causes misery to millions of women. A recent study found that one in four middle-aged women aren’t happy with the quality of their sleep, while another major piece of research found menopausal women are nearly four times more likely to have insomnia. Alongside hot flushes, memory loss and mood swings, sleeplessness is a surprising side-effect of the menopause . And it’s not just irritating — lack of sleep has significant health implications and has been linked to obesity, high blood pressure, dementia and cancer. Colin Espie, professor of behavioural sleep medicine at Oxford University, says: ‘The menopause or associated HRT treatment is a time of major hormonal, physical and psychological change so it can often be a trigger for insomnia. Levels of both the female hormones, progesterone and oestrogen, drop. ‘Progesterone is known as a sleep-promoting hormone, while the reduction in oestrogen can leave you more susceptible to environmental factors that can disrupt sleep, such as light. ‘Hot flushes with their surge of adrenaline and change in temperature can also disrupt your sleep.’ Barbara, a retired college principal who lives with her husband, Trevor, in Devon, started suffering from insomnia ten years ago. ‘It was around the time the menopause kicked in and I was suffering badly with hot flushes. I didn’t put two and two together — and there was no information that the menopause could cause sleeplessness. ‘I’d feel tired but then, when I got into bed, it was like a switch had been turned on and I suddenly felt wide awake. When I finally did get to sleep, I’d wake up again after two hours. ‘All sorts of ridiculous worries would come into my head. Before, I’d always gone to bed at around 10pm and slept through the night.’ The resulting exhaustion took its toll on Barbara. ‘When the alarm went off in the mornings, I felt so irritable. It made me clumsy, snappy and forgetful. ‘I had a very demanding job, but I felt so foggy and dazed that everything started taking me much longer to finish. And I started spotting mistakes in my work. One time I was driving and I had to stop the car because I felt so confused. Barbara's tiredness started to affect both her work and her personality . ‘By the evenings I was just shattered. I’d go to the theatre and as soon as the show started, I’d be nodding off, no matter how good it was. I started staying in more.’ While she started HRT to battle the other menopausal symptoms, Barbara assumed she had to put up with sleeplessness. She didn’t want to take sleeping pills so tried to find her own solutions — going for 15-mile walks once a week — but that didn’t work either. The problem isn’t just dropping off, but sleeping through the night, too. One study found 60 per cent of middle-aged women wake in the night at least once a week. They are also statistically more likely to ask their GP for sleeping tablets. The average person wakes up six times per night . This was the case for secondary school teacher Monica Troughton. ‘I always used to sleep like a log and would struggle to get up in the morning,’ says Monica, 60, a mother of two who lives with husband David, 61, an artist, in Leamington Spa. ‘Now, although I fall asleep easily at around 10.30pm, every night without fail I wake at three in the morning and cannot get back to sleep.’ All those hours spent lying awake started to take their toll. ‘I looked and felt awful,’ Monica says. ‘I just couldn’t think properly and would be crabby with David. Secondary school teacher Monica Troughton spent hours lying awake after she hit the menopause . ‘Sometimes, I’d wake him up in the night, which would really wind him up. I became anti-social because I was so neurotic about sleep — if people came round I’d worry they’d stay too late.’ Although Monica’s sleep problems started when she hit the menopause at around 50, they weren’t prompted by night sweats. ‘Thankfully, I haven’t suffered with hot flushes,’ she says. ‘So although I think insomnia is linked to the menopause, I wouldn’t say it’s confined to those who suffer from hot flushes.’ Monica and husband David. She says sometimes she would wake him up in the night which would really wind him up . Formerly a writer, Monica started researching a book about the menopause: ‘I spoke to more than 100 menopausal women. Without exception, they all said they woke up in the night.’ Over the years, Monica has tried everything from acupuncture, hormone replacement therapy, hot drinks and herbal remedies — to no avail. At one point, she took sleeping tablets while on holiday despite an aversion to them. ‘I was worried about waking up in the hotel and not being able to roam around like I can at home,’ she says. ‘They knocked me out but I didn’t feel refreshed. I’d get quite tearful about it. The thing I hated most was feeling disorientated the following day.’ Monica has tried everything from acupuncture, hormone replacement therapy, hot drinks and herbal remedies . In the end, Monica learned to simply accept her fate. ‘I’ve found the best thing to do is get up and do something. It stops me panicking about how tired I’m going to be. ‘I’ll polish a mirror, read a book — I’ve even baked a cake. Now I understand that sleep patterns change throughout your life and the worst thing to do is panic about it because then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.’ Writer Jacqui Deevoy, 52, also tries to adopt a positive approach to menopausal insomnia. But there’s no denying the anxiety it caused her initially. ‘I used to be a really good sleeper and would boast about the fact I needed 12 hours sleep a night,’ says Jacqui, who lives in West London and has four children, aged from 14 to 25. ‘A couple of years ago, I started waking throughout the night — sometimes only getting three hours’ sleep. Although I didn’t suffer hot flushes, I knew it must be hormonal. ‘I still find that I just can’t sleep like I used to. Quite often I go to bed at 2.30am but am wide awake by 7am. ‘I tried taking herbal remedies but nothing made a difference.’ Like Monica, Jacqui has dealt with the lack of a cure by trying to accept the change. ‘The worst bit is when the birds start singing at 4am and you realise you’ve got to get up in a couple of hours,’ she says. ‘But I noticed that it was around this time that I started having epiphanies about aspects of my life. So I tried to think of the menopause as a positive change — perhaps I just don’t need as much sleep.’ Surely there must be something that can be done? Professor Espie says: ‘By far the most effective long-term solution is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). ‘It helps people to think and behave differently in relation to their sleep in such a way that normal good sleep can return. If you let your insomnia go untreated, it can continue long after the menopause has finished.’ Writer Jacqui Deevoy, 52, tries to adopt a positive approach to menopausal insomnia . As for Barbara, three months ago she read about an online self-help programme called Sleepio based on the principles of CBT. ‘For the first two weeks you fill in lots of questions about your lifestyle and sleep patterns, then you go on to a sleep deprivation programme. I wasn’t allowed to go to bed until 1am and had to get up at 7am. ‘That’s been one of the hardest things for me — it’s really hard not to nap. I realised that I’d got myself into a bad pattern of going to sleep in the day and probably going to bed too early, too. ‘I cannot tell you the joy I experience just from getting into bed, turning out the light and falling gently to sleep. ‘I still have my off days and I know I can’t cure it overnight. But for now, I’m delighted, and so is my husband, who’s politely said I seem to be much happier these days.’ sleepio.com .","Barbara Paul, 63, would survive on as little as two hours of sleep a night .

"Arran Tosh, 13, from Sudbury, Suffolk, died on June 7, just five days after being diagnosed with a brain tumour . A 13-year-old boy who launched a solo mission to raise £1,000 for a cancer charity has died from a brain tumour - just days after it was detected through a routine eye test. Arran Tosh had no idea he was critically-ill until he visited the opticians in his home town in Sudbury, Suffolk, less than two weeks ago. The optician spotted pressure behind his eye and Arran was sent to hospital for further tests, where he was diagnosed with a slow-growing tumour. But despite having emergency surgery that same week, the young boy died - just five days after being diagnosed. Arran's diagnosis came just months after he had set up a JustGiving page to raise money for Cancer Research UK. Arran was inspired to set up the page after his auntie Kerry was diagnosed with breast cancer. He vowed to shave his head if he reached his £1,000 target. Donations have now poured in to Arran's website from all over . the world. The total amount raised through the page, which was at £750 when Arran died, had reached £11,500 this morning. His mother Alison, 43, said her son would be stunned by the generosity of the donations. She said she and the rest of Arran's family were now hoping to set up a permanent trust in his name. She said: 'Arran hoped to teach music, drama or . history one day, but in the meantime, he just wanted to do as much as he . could for charity. 'He . said if he could reach the £1,000 for Cancer Research he would then . raise money for HCPT - The Pilgrimage Trust - which takes children with . special needs on pilgrimage to Lourdes in France.' Arran's diagnosis came after he went for a routine eye test on May 31, where the optician detected some . pressure behind his eyes. The optician booked Arran in for an MRI scan and . further eye tests at West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St Edmunds, three days later. Those tests showed Arran had been living with a slow-growing brain tumour. Arran was then rushed to Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, for surgery. Arran, pictured here with his sisters Abbie and Chloe, was diagnosed with the slow-growing tumour after a routine visit to the optician, who spotted a build-up of pressure behind Arran's eye . But surgeons were unable to remove all the tumour and Arran was put on a life support. He died five days after his diagnosis, on Saturday, June 7. Mrs Tosh told the Cambridge News: 'He came round, he . was quite sleepy. But then there were complications with not being able . to remove all of the tumour. 'Because . the tumour was slow-growing and had been growing for years he could . have been busking, playing football, with his friends or on his own with . no family around him and just collapsed.' Arran’s sister Abbie, 18, said the family was so proud of what Arran had achieved. She said: 'He is my little angel and I am so . proud of everything he has achieved, not only after his passing but when . he was with us too. Arran, pictured here with his sisters, his mother Alison . and his father Stephen, had recently set up a JustGiving page to raise . money for Cancer Research UK. He planned to shave his head if he raised . £1,000 for the cause . 'Arran . would light up any room as soon as he walked into it and his smile was . contagious - this is something that will carry on happening through his . spirit. 'Although my little . brother is no longer with us, I will forever love him and miss him, and I . will always be proud of the young man he was.' Donations have poured into the JustGiving page since Arran's death. His . mother Alison, pictured above with her son, said he would be stunned by . people's generosity . Arran, a keen footballer, had recently busked outside the Cancer Research charity shop in Sudbury to raise money for the cause. His . auntie Tracy Milligan said: 'Arran was tirelessly raising money for . Cancer Research, inspired by his other auntie and a family friend who . suffered the terrible disease. 'Then out of the blue last Monday morning, he was diagnosed with a brain tumour. 'With his family by his side, he calmly and bravely went into battle on Tuesday morning with that huge smile of his and a determined attitude.' Mrs Tosh, along with his sisters Abbie and Chloe, 20, and his father Stephen, are now hoping to set up The Smile of Arran to continue with the teenager's fundraising mission. Mrs Tosh said: 'Although Arran had so much ability and was so talented, he was never arrogant. 'He had a wonderful sense of humour and all he ever wanted to be was someone who made people happy - and he wanted to make other people’s lives easier.' Arran loved singing and played the guitar with his band, The Stopclocks. He was also an enthusiastic sportsman and aspiring actor. Supporters left heartbreaking messages as they contributed to Arran’s cause on his JustGiving page. The Keep family of Leavenheath, Suffolk, said: 'We weren’t lucky enough to have known you Arran but your story has touched our hearts. God bless and sleep tight x' Lez said: 'Heard about this darling boy from a friend on twitter and it broke my heart. I am in Australia. God love you forever Arran.' Hilary Scott said: 'In tears even though I did know Arran or his family. No words just respect for this brave little man.' J Rout said: 'Such a blessing to have taught Arran at Hedingham. My prayers are with the family. Heavens choir has gained a wonderful soul. Keep them all in tune up there Arran!' Amelia & Edward O’Connell said: 'Life won’t be the same without you. Your cheery smile will always be remembered. I am so lucky to have met such a great person. Our thoughts are with you and your family.

"Prices have plunged downhill at ski resorts, offering British winter sports enthusiasts good value for money this year. In-resort costs have slid as much as 23 per cent compared with last winter, a survey by Post Office Travel Money in partnership with Crystal Ski Holidays found. The 23 per cent fall was in the Andorran resort of Soldeu, one of 19 destinations out of 27 surveyed where costs were lower than last year. The Andorran ski resort of Soldeu has seen the biggest slide with a 23 per cent price reduction at resort . How different resorts compare in Europe - Austria and Switzerland remain a pricey option for families . The survey covered costs such as equipment, six-day passes, lessons and food and drink. Total costs were at their lowest in Bansko in Bulgaria (£261), while other good-value resorts were Kranjska Gora in Slovenia (£300), Ellmau in Austria (£311) and Livigno in Italy (£322). Priciest of the European resorts surveyed was Zermatt in Switzerland (£687). Ski holidays across Europe are now cheaper . The best-value of the six North American resorts surveyed was Tremblant in Quebec, Canada, where the costs were £566. Costs in Breckenridge in Colorada, US, have fallen 17 per cent to £682, but they have risen 21 per cent at another Colorado resort - Winter Park - where costs are £607. Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'Although skiing is still cheapest in Bulgaria and Slovenia, growing competition for business means there are great bargains to be struck in many of the most popular European resorts this season. 'What's more, the continuing strength of sterling against European currencies provides the added bonus of more pounds in their pockets for UK skiers.' Among 10 World-Class Resorts surveyed, prices are down 13 per cent in Sestriere to £354, making the Italian resort best value in this category for the second year running. There has also been a 16 per cent fall in Courchevel (France) to £503, although the reverse has proved true in Zermatt (£687). High ski hire and lift price charges will make the Swiss resort 16 per cent more expensive than last year and highest-priced overall in Europe. In the Best for Families category, Bansko (£848) remains the cheapest skiing for a family of four. However, Kranjska Gora (£1,110) has lost its runner up position because of a significant 18 per cent price fall in both Soldeu (£982) and Ellmau (£985). Mr Brown added: 'It's great news that families can look forward to lower prices in most ski resorts this season. However, it is important for them to check all the resort costs they will face and add these to the package price before deciding on a ski destination so they have a true picture of what their holiday is likely to cost them.' After the Sochi Winter Olympics spotlighted the growing number of winter sports now available and Crystal Ski Holidays confirmed mounting demand for these, the report includes prices for activities ranging from tobogganing, snowmobiling and ice skating to high adrenaline sports like snow tubing, ice climbing, paragliding and husky sledging. In almost all cases the charges for these are payable once holidaymakers reach their resort and can add hundreds of pounds to the cost of a skiing holiday. 'Enthusiasts can now try out a wide range of winter sports activities but these extras come at a price and careful budgeting is needed to make sure the ski budget does not go 'off piste'. Paying on plastic can incur transaction charges and so too can using an ATM abroad, said Mr Brown. The market shares are provided by Crystal Ski Industry Report 2014 (crystalski.co.uk) Bulgarian resort Bansko is the best option for families, costing £848 for a family of four once there . Best value transatlantic ski resorts, with Canada coming in with the cheapest prices . Other items will cost skiers extra as well – not least the cost of airport transfers if you don't book with a ski operator, which can add at least £50 per person for the return trip. Plan ahead and allow enough money to cover transfers and après ski events as well as extra ski equipment hire.' In North America, Tremblant (£566) emerges as best value of six Transatlantic Ski Resorts surveyed for this year's Post Office Travel Money Ski Resort Report. A nine per cent price fall – mostly the result of a weaker Canadian dollar – has compounded the impact of last season's 21 per cent drop. By contrast, prices in Winter Park, last year's best value tip, have risen 15 per cent to £607. Rising rates for ski equipment, lift passes and tuition account for the increase. For those who want high-end, these are the prices of world class resorts around the world, per person . Elsewhere in Colorado prices have plunged 17 per cent in Breckenridge (£682), mostly as a result of a fall in ski-related charges, and almost eight per cent in Vail (£751). Tamsin Todd, Crystal Ski Holidays managing director, said: 'We've seen that Britain's successes in the Olympics and Paralympics have renewed interest in snow sports with people looking for fun and active holidays. 'Now that ski resorts are open for the season, we can't wait to get back to the mountains and are ready with our digital and mobile advances to help make customer experiences better than ever.'","Andorran resort of Soldeu is 23% cheaper this year compared to 2013 .

"Do you know someone inspirational? The search for the 2013 winner is on . The Daily Mail is proud to be running our seventh Inspirational Women of the Year Awards, in association with British Gas and the charity Shelter. Over the coming weeks, we want you to nominate the special women who deserve to be recognised. Here, we tell the story of one of our remarkable nominees. When Emma Salisbury learned her four-year-old son Tommy had an incurable condition which would cause him slowly to go blind, she held him close and wept, grieving for the sight he would lose, imagining his life in a blanket of darkness. And then she decided to try to save him. Emma well knew how devastating the condition - choroideremia - could be, as it had left her grandfather blind at 39. She tracked down a scientist at Imperial College in London who was carrying out research on mice in the hope of one day developing a treatment. 'My husband Paul and I went to see him,' says Emma. 'Afterwards, we looked at each other and said: “He's not going to stop until there's a cure. We've got to help him.” ' They decided to raise money to help with the research. It started in 2005 with a coffee morning, and quickly built up to golf days, school discos, marathons and bike rides. Eight years on, Emma has so far raised the staggering sum of £300,000. The result? In October 2010, the world's first clinical trial for a treatment for choroideremia began. It's no exaggeration to say the trial was only possible because of Emma's contributions. Campaigner: Emma Salisbury with 13-year-old son Tommy. Emma has raised £300,000 to help cure Tommy's choroideremia . Robert Maclaren, professor of ophthalmology at the University of Oxford, who is leading the two-year trial, says Emma's fundraising is 'the single most significant factor that enabled our team of researchers to lead the world in starting the first clinical trial for this disease'. The results of the trial will be published next month, and Emma has met some of the participants. 'All of them have had an improvement,' she says. 'One man who used only to be able to read 17 letters at a time can now read 37. Another, who has lost night vision, said he can see the stars again.' Emma knows it may be five years before the treatment becomes available to help Tommy, now 13 - as the team must do more studies and monitor the participants to ensure the treatment is effective and safe. 'But it's hugely encouraging,' she says. Choroideremia is a genetic condition that causes the degeneration of the choroid. This layer of blood vessels at the back of the eye provides oxygen for the retina, which converts beams of light into images, allowing a person to see. The first symptom is night blindness, or being unable to see in dark surroundings, which tends to start in childhood. Next the sufferer loses peripheral vision, and then central vision. The rate at which choroideremia progresses varies - Emma's grandfather wasn't diagnosed until his 20s. The condition is passed down through a faulty gene on the  X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, so if they carry the faulty gene they will have a healthy version of the gene on their other X chromosome, protecting them from developing it. Devastating: Choroideremia is a genetic condition that causes the degeneration of the blood vessels that provide oxygen for the retina, resulting in blindness . That's why only men, who have just one X chromosome, develop it if they have the faulty gene. Emma's first child was a girl, Amelia, then Tommy arrived two years later. The couple have since had another son, Johnny, now three. Emma knew she carried the faulty gene since she was tested aged seven. She and Paul, a builder, always knew that if they had a son, he would have a 50 per cent chance of having choroideremia. 'I've met parents who've said if they'd known they carried this gene they wouldn't have gone through with the pregnancy, but I don't understand that thinking,' says Emma, 41, who works for a private equity company and lives with her family in Welling, Kent. 'We'd never want to change Tommy - he's our child.' After Tommy's birth, she took him to Moorfields Eye Hospital in London to see if he was at risk. 'The specialist told me to get him tested a bit later,' she says. 'At that point there was no sign of a cure and he said waiting a while  wouldn't make any difference.' In February 2005, when Tommy was four, she went back to the specialist, who broke the awful news that Tommy had the condition. 'We burst into tears - me, Paul, and my mum. Even though there were no signs of problems, we went through six months of grieving for the sight he'd lose. 'Sometimes I'd stand there with my eyes closed and think, is this what it's going to be like for him?' From the start, she and Paul decided to talk to Tommy openly about his condition. 'What's . phenomenal is this isn't major donors writing enormous cheques. This is . hard-slogging fundraising - cake sales, coffee mornings, friends and . family pulling together to raise tiny amounts, bit by bit. [Emma is] an . inspiration to us at the charity.' 'We told him his eyes were different from everybody else's, and when he was older they wouldn't work as well,' she says. 'His friends have been great. When they go on school journeys, where there's camping and night-time activities, they say: “Don't worry, we'll look after him.” ' But she admits that watching Tommy grow up and start to understand has, at times, been unbearably sad. 'When he was about seven, one night I heard him crying,' says Emma. 'I sat on his bed and he said: “Will I go blind one day?” 'I explained this was why we were raising money. And that it wouldn't happen until he was much older. 'He said, “OK, that's all right then,” rolled over and went to sleep. It was heartbreaking, but made me more determined to carry on.' Emma admits that when she and her mother Dot Grindley set up the Tommy Salisbury Choroideremia Fund in 2005, she never expected to raise as much money. 'But everywhere I went, people wanted to do something, and suddenly I was raising £60,000 a year.' Michele Acton, chief executive of the charity Fight For Sight, which helps Emma run her fund, says she is 'astounded' at the amount she's raised. 'Very few people could do what she has done,' she adds. 'What's phenomenal is this isn't major donors writing enormous cheques. This is hard-slogging fundraising - cake sales, coffee mornings, friends and family pulling together to raise tiny amounts, bit by bit. She's an inspiration to us at the charity.' Young promise: Tommy, aged four, the age at which he and his family learned of his condition . Emma has also become a great support for many other parents she has met who are affected by choroideremia. 'The hardest thing is hearing from parents whose child has just been diagnosed, because it brings all those memories back.' The biggest reward has been the start of the clinical trial. With the help of Emma's money, the researchers at Imperial discovered that in patients with choroideremia, when the cells of the choroid and retina die, they do not regenerate as they should. This has led to the development of a treatment injecting the eye with cells cultured from genes found in a healthy eye - the subject of the current trial (funded in part by the Department of Health). None of this would have happened without Emma. Phenomenal: Emma has raised the staggering sum of £300,000 to fund research on a cure for choroideremia . As Professor Maclaren explains: 'The problem with very rare diseases is they tend to not get funding for research. While choroideremia is rare, it's devastating for those who have it. What's more, the technology we're developing is relevant to other causes of blindness, including age-related macular degeneration.' Emma says while her primary aim was to help her son, everything she does 'will help other families with choroideremia around the world'. 'People tell me I must be so excited, but I won't be until Tommy has his first appointment to have it,' says Emma. 'He's told me how proud he is of everything we're doing.' For now, Tommy is a normal, happy teenage boy. 'Sometimes I feel anxious about him,' says Emma. 'I think how he might be if he can't play football any more, or if he's not able to drive. But I look on the bright side and hope some of that attitude rubs off on Tommy. 'What has happened is tragic for Tommy and for us, but we're so grateful for what we have. Tommy can walk, he can talk and he can lead a full, happy life.' She and Paul have not yet had their younger son, Johnny, tested for the faulty gene, but plan to when he is approaching five. 'At the moment, I don't think I could handle it,' Emma says. Visit fightforsight.org.uk/tommysalisburyfund .","Emma was devastated when she learned her son had inherited a disease .

The inappropriate relationship began in February 2012 when Murray, who is still married, was tutoring the Spanish-speaking eighth grader and the two went on to have 'repeated' sexual encounters, according to KHOU. On one occasion, Murray picked up the teen from a school dance after his dad dropped him off and took him to a hotel where they had sex for two hours. The couple were caught the following night by the teen's younger brother who found them in bed at the family home while their parents were away. Murray was fired that month following the allegations but remained free on $50,000 bail. Police discovered that the two had sex in a classroom at least twice and that prior to her arrest, Murray had closed her bank account and planned to skip the border to Mexico. At school: In the course of their investigation, police discovered that Murray had sex with the 15-year-old student she was tutoring at least two times in a classroom at Memorial Middle School . Despite being barred from seeing the teen by a judge, the affair continued. In January 2013, Murray was arrested again when she was found with the teen at her father's home. When police showed up at the house, the teen, then 16, tried to escape through the back door. She was charged with harboring a runaway and this time her bond was revoked. Sentencing in the case happened on Tuesday. Won't stop: Murray's affair with the boy continued even after she was arrested. Police found the then 16-year-old with Murray at her father's house and she was charged with harboring a minor . Murray attended Memorial Middle and High School and had been working in the Spring Branch ISD for the previous three years as a language arts teacher. Records say she is still married to her husband and they live at the same address in Houston. To this day, the teen she had relations with insists that they are in love but his mother calls him a victim. 'We are not good, we are very hurt. My son is really confused, hurt. We working with him very closely but he’s not good, not good at all,' the mother said.","Kathryn Camille Murray, 31, began an affair with a Spanish-speaking student, 15, she was tutoring in February 2012 .

"For decades, scientists have tried to perfect methods and analyze data in a bid to predict earthquakes before they happen and potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives. However, an author living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania claims the answers are in plain sight and David Nabhan has now written a book about his remarkable findings. Mr Nabhan, a former science teacher from California, became interested in earthquakes. He was in charge of the emergency preparedness plan at the school where he worked. Cracking the code: Author David Nabhan believes he has found the key to accurately predicting when an earthquake will strike and has suggested there is a pattern between them . Real science? Earthquake prediction has been almost a taboo field of study for the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the very governmental agency in charge of making progress in this area, leaving their conservative approach to draw criticism from prominent seismologists worldwide . Scientists and folklorists have used a dizzying selection of methods and theories trying to make earthquake forecasts for years, with little success. Animal behavior, changes in the weather, and seismograms have all fallen short. Scientists first turned to seismology as a predictive tool, hoping to find patterns of foreshocks that might indicate that a fault is about to slip. But nobody has been able to reliably distinguish between the waves of . energy that herald a great earthquake and harmless rumblings. He says he noticed every earthquake happened at dusk or dawn. 'I . realized this sort of conscience doesn’t happen in science. These dawn . and dusk quakes during new and full moons are the paradigm on the west . coast,' he said. 'All . six great quakes that have struck in Los Angeles that have killed people . since the 30s, all of them, dawn or dusk quakes', he told CBS . Pittsburgh. Mr Nabhan says that it is the 'conjoined lunar and solar gravitational tides,' that causes the quakes. 'Just . imagine the muscle required to move our oceans around every day. Our . fractured fault lines are not immune to this power,' he said. The prevailing view has placed seismic forecasting in the realm of near impossibility, but Mr Nabhan insists that a number of facts infer quite the opposite. The Christchurch Catholic Cathedral is extensively damaged after an earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand in December 2011 . Displaced Haitians walk the streets amid collapsed buildings and rubble in downtown Port Au Prince, Haiti in January 2010 . January 2010, Haiti More than 300,000 die and over a million are displaced following magnitude 7 quake . July 1976, China Officially 242,769 die in 7.5 strike but figure could be more than tripple that . December 2004, Sumatra 9.1 earthquake struck here and caused subsequent tsunami in 14 countries. Nearly 300,000 dead and 1.7m displaced . December 1920, China A magnitude 7 quake which killed 200,000 . September 1923, Japan Extreme destruction and 142,800 dead in Kanto . His book presents a persuasive and . open-minded inquiry into compelling clues and data that have been . downplayed or ignored for almost two centuries, connecting hundreds of . scientific studies with a stunning series of historic seismic events on . the US West coast during the 20th century. Remarkable . evidence gives a thought-provoking overview of how this topic has . remained in scientific limbo for so many centuries, culminating in a . list of hours-long higher probability windows for seismicity into the . future. Mr Nabhan lists the plain . spoken reasons how and why it should be realized that it is plausible, . with some degree of accuracy, to forecast the next ground-shaking . catastrophe. Mr Nabhan . says that there has never been a new idea in science that wasn’t . accepted without a fight and claims the next earthquake will happen on . July 12 and September 9, between 4:45 to 7:55 a.m. or p.m. In his book, Mr Nabhan lists every tremor powerful enough to have caused fatalities within a 70 mile radius of Los Angeles' city center, struck Southern California between 1933 and 1994. He states that every one of them occurred either within a tight 3 hour window at dawn or a corresponding time interval at dusk. Two thirds of those events also took place not only either at dawn or dusk, but within 36 hours of the precise instant of new or full moon phases. Pattern: Two thirds of recent earthquake events took place not only either at dawn or dusk, but within 36 hours of the new or full moon phases . Findings: David Nabhan, who spent 20 years as a junior high instructor in Southern California, believes the forces of gravity and where the sun and moon are could determine large temblors . The great quakes on the U.S. West Coast north of Southern California also fit this historic pattern. The Great San Francisco Earthquake (1906) clocked in at 5:12 AM; Loma Prieta (1989) struck almost precisely 12 hours later:  5:04 PM. Anchorage was destroyed on Good Friday, 1964 at 5:36 PM--47 minutes away from the exact moment when the Moon entered the greatest extent of it's fullness. The last Big One on the Southern San Andreas (1857) hit Fort Tejon in the early morning. The May 2, 1996 magnitude 5.4 Seattle earthquake, the largest in that city’s history since 1965, rocked the Puget Sound area no more than 9 minutes outside the time and date forecasted in David Nabhan’s first book. Mr Nabhan suggests there is fairly solid evidence to support the hypothesis that solar and lunar tides working in tandem might actually have a hand in at least helping to trigger tremors on the West Coast. However, U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Lucy Jones is more wary about predicting such earthquakes. 'There’s a very slight correlation. Not enough to predict any earthquake out of it,' she told CBS Los Angeles said. 'People try to make patterns out of anything that scares them. We haven’t found anything that looks different before a big earthquake than other times. We get enough people sending us predictions. The slug trail lady who used to go out in her driveway and map out the slug trails in the morning and use that to predict where the next earthquake was going to happen.' Asked about earthquake weather, Jones said, 'The reality is earthquakes happen 5 to 10 miles deep in the earth and surface weather doesn’t affect anything at that depth.' Asked what causes a quake to start and stop, she said, 'I don’t know. We have figured out that earthquakes are happening at much lower stresses, and now we’re trying to understand the mechanisms that let them happen.'","David Nabhan claims there is a pattern as to when earthquakes occur and that they can be predicted .

"A former Culver City High School student has alleged she was raped by three members of the football team, who videoed the attack and shared it among friends. The student, identified only as 'A.S', has filed a lawsuit against the California school district and claimed she was 14 when assaults occurred in December 2013. The lawsuit claims the three students lured the girl to a car in the school parking lot to listen to music and then raped her and forced to engage in unspecified sex acts with one of the football players while two others held her. Serious allegations: A former student of Culver City High School has filed a civil complaint alleging she was raped by three football players in December of 2013 when she was 14 . The girl claims the school district was negligent when she complained and as a result of her ordeal had to move school twice and now lives in Chicago. The civil complaint, which identifies one of her alleged assailants as Jeremy Weaver, says that she was raped and made to perform oral sex 'and other sex acts' according to KTLA. The teenager claims the attack was videoed and shared around the school along with 'rumors regarding A.S's 'sexual promiscuity'. According to the girl, Weaver and the other two threatened her if she came forward. Custody: One of the three defendants in the lawsuit is named as Jeremy Weaver and he was arrested on January 15 and convicted of a minor felony in June . Eventually, the teenager, who was a virgin at the time of the incident told school officials. She claims they went to the boys with the allegations and as a result, she suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and attempted suicide. Weaver was convicted of three counts of oral copulation with a minor and one count of dissuading a witness from committing a crime. Jeremy Ray Weaver was arrested on January 15, 2014 and convicted in June.

"La Liga side Valencia say they will not use a new version of its bat logo that comic book maker DC Comics had opposed for being too similar to its Batman symbol.

"A growing number of women are dismissing the career-driven conventions they were raised with, saying no to full-time work; believing instead that every household needs one primary caretaker - the mother. One year ago, Kelly Makino, 33, quit her job running a program for at-risk children to stay home full time, because, she says, women are better at that job than men. The mother-of-two and self-described 'flaming liberal' and feminist, told New York magazine: 'The feminist revolution started in the workplace, and now it’s happening at home.' Feminist housewife: A new breed of women believe that managing and raising their family is is a woman's highest achievement . Mrs Makino, who has a Masters of Social Work from the University of Pennsylvania, and struggled to balance long hours with caring for her children 'properly,' said that no amount of professional . success could compare to her happiness knowing her two children, Connor, five, and Lillie, four, were being looked after by her - not a nanny. Her sacrifice of a salary pays her family back in ways Mrs Makino believes are priceless, and she is not alone. A new breed of young, educated, and married mothers are finding . themselves untouched by the notion of 'having it . all.' For the first time since the . downturn of 2008, the percentage of stay-at-home mothers rose between 2010 and 2011 - and some of the . biggest increases have been among younger mothers, aged 25 to 35. Mrs Makino is now able to be present for her children no matter what - cooking healthy meals, helping patiently with homework, and . most importantly, devoting herself to teaching them life lessons, from manners to good habits, that she believes every child should know. Patricia Ireland, left her job as a wealth adviser three years ago after her third . child was born, and she has no plans to go back to . work. Rather than a a sacrifice, she feels it is a privilege to oversee 'not . just what they do, but what they believe, how they talk to other . children, what kind of story we read together. That’s all dictated by . me. Not by my nanny or my babysitter.' Her husband, who also works in fiance, deposits his monthly paycheck in their joint . account. 'I’m really grateful that my husband and I have fallen into . traditional gender roles without conflict,' Mrs Ireland said. 'Family is what is . important in life - not pushing papers at some crap job' 'I’m not . bitter that I’m the one home and he goes to work. And he’s very happy . that he goes to work.' Meanwhile Facebook COO and mother-of-two, Sheryl Sandberg, in her new . book, Lean In, argues . that a generation of tougher, stronger and more strategic women are needed to equalize U.S. workplaces. But . Mrs Makino and Mrs Ireland are among those who view managing their . children's lives, and their household, as their highest achievement. They believe they are better equip for the job than their husbands, and . are blissfully happy in their decision. 'Some days I just have to pinch myself,' Mrs Makino said. 'It’s so easy, it’s so rewarding to live this way.' She also believes women are conditioned to . be more patient with children, to be better multitaskers, and to be more . tolerant of the daily grind of childcare. Working mom: Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg argues that tougher women are needed to equalize U.S. workplace in her new book, Lean In . 'Women keep it together better than guys do,' she said. 'Women are raised from the get-go to raise children successfully. When we are moms, we have a better toolbox. 'I want my daughter to be able to do anything she wants. But I also want to say, ""Have a career that you can walk away from at the drop of a hat.""' One woman on . the UrbanBaby message boards recently wrote: 'I was blessed with the patience to truly enjoy . being home with my kids and know that in the end family is what is . important in life - not pushing papers at some crap job.' New York . University sociologist Kathleen Gerson, author of The Unfinished Revolution: . Coming of Age in a New Era of Gender, Work and Family, noted in 2010 that a quarter of women would still choose a . traditional domestic arrangement over the independence that comes with a . career, despite all . She said more mothers believe 'that only a parent can provide an . acceptable level of care' and that 'they are the only parent . available for the job.' Mrs Makino explained: 'I feel like in today’s society, women . who don’t work are bucking the convention we were raised with... Why . can’t we just be girls? Why do we have to be boys and girls at the same . time?' Stacy Morrison, editor-in-chief of BlogHer, a network of 3,000 blogs for and by women, added: 'What these women feel is that the trade-offs now between working and not working are becoming more and more unsustainable. 'The conversation we hear over and over again is this: ""The sense of calm and control that we feel over our lives is so much better than what is currently on offer in our culture."" And they’re not wrong.' In her much-discussed Atlantic piece, Why Women Still Can't Have It All, . Anne-Marie Slaughter called for better workplace programs: . more parental leave, more part-time and flextime options. But even she admits this new breed of women could be on to something. 'Are there . characteristics inherent in sex differences that make women more . nurturing and men more assertive?' she asks in Lean In. 'Quite possibly.' As they mature, women earn less than men and are granted fewer responsibilities at work. Since Betty Friedan published The Feminine Mystique fifty years ago, women still earn 77 cents to the male dollar, representing just a small portion of corporate and government leaders. Despite bowing out of this fight for gender equality in the workforce, Mrs Makino said she is convinced she made the right decision. 'I know this investment in my family will be paid back when the time is right,' she said, referring the option of someday, when her children start college, figuring out what she will peruse next. 'You have to live in the now. I will deal with later when later comes. I’ll find a way. Who knows? Maybe I will be home for ever and ever. Maybe I will have the best-kept lawn on the block for the rest of my life.'","A new breed of women are turning their backs on Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's new .

"The Foreign Office has warned drivers to be especially careful in Spain where motorists in British registered cars are being targeted by unscrupulous thieves . Britons heading to Spain  on holiday have been warned to watch out for highway robbers targeting some of the most popular tourist routes. Organised gangs are singling out foreign drivers heading for the coast and creating a distraction to steal passports, cash and computers. As the summer holiday season gets under way, the Foreign Office has warned of a surge in the thefts. It says most of the 612 emergency travel documents issued by British consulates in Spain this year followed motorway attacks and has released a video showing footage of robberies and some of the tactics used. Gangs often flag victims down, indicating there is a problem with their car. While one robber gets out to distract the tourists, their unseen accomplice steals documents, money and valuables from the car before making a swift getaway. While there have been isolated incidents in the past, officials say gangs are now operating routinely along the coast between Barcelona and Alicante, across Andalucia in the south and in the Madrid region. Spanish police have had to deal with 126 British victims of distraction thefts on one motorway – the busy AP7 from the French border to Valencia – in the past two years. Another main highway where cars with GB number plates or rental stickers are being targeted is on roads from the northern ferry port of Santander to Madrid and further south to Spain’s popular beaches. Pensioner Roy Moore, 69, and his wife Helen had the rear tyre of their Peugeot slashed with a knife when they stopped at a service station near Logrono en route to the Costa Calida in Murcia province. The thieves took their passports, €300 , bank and credit cards, a laptop, driving licence, their dog’s pet passport and the keys to their home in Salisbury, Wiltshire. Mrs Moore, a retired care home worker, said: ‘It all happened so fast. We were left in shock, penniless at the roadside and stranded in Spain along with our dog Merlyn. ‘The police and the British vice consul in Alicante were very helpful. We can get temporary one-day travel documents issued except for Merlyn, who is technically stuck in Spain until we can arrange veterinary clearance for him to eventually return to England.’ Thieves have attacked 126 British motorists using the AP7 from the French border to Valencia over the past two years using distraction threats, stealing cash, passports and electronic goods . Richard Hibbs, from Llandudno in North Wales, and his brother-in-law, who lives in Spain, were robbed of their passports and other documents after a gang stopped their car near a toll booth on the AP7 north of Barcelona. He said: ‘Anyone travelling with UK plates should think at least twice before stopping on a Spanish motorway, particularly at night, and don’t keep your valuables in the same place. If you do have to stop, don’t all get out of the car.’ Will Middleton, the consular regional director for Spain, said: ‘Distraction is the most common technique used by the highway robbers. ‘They will try to worry you about the state of your vehicle, and then whilst they point out the supposed problem, an accomplice is robbing you. ‘So be wary of anyone attempting to stop when you are driving, or trying to point out a problem or offering assistance. They may not be the Good Samaritan they appear to be.’","More than one British motorist a week targeted on a single section of road .

"NBC analyst Roger Maltbie's golf cart driver has been charged with assault after running over a highway patrol officer at the US Open Championships, officials said yesterday. Driver Thomas Lineberry allegedly refused to stop on the tee when ordered by a North Carolina Highway Patrolman, before driving over the officer's foot at Pinehurst Golf Course yesterday. Incredible photographs show Trooper R. A. Goodin chasing after the buggy before leaping on the back, gripping the 59-year-old driver's neck and shoulders from behind. Maltbie ran to the aid of his friend and colleague as he was handcuffed. 'This is a new one,' Maltbie said, as he walked down the 11th fairway. 'I’ve been to a couple of rodeos and a county fair and I’ve never had this happen.' Bizarre arrest: A North Carolina State Trooper leaped onto the back of a golf cart at the US Open on Saturday to arrest the driver, Tommy Lineberry, who he said drove over his foot . Scene: A North Carolina Highway Patrolman (right) arrested gold cart driver Tommy Lineberry (second right) for allegedly failing to follow instructions and driving over his foot. Lineberry drove NBC Sports analyst Roger Maltbie's (left) golf cart at the US Open in North Carolina on Saturday . The bizarre incident occurred as US Open leader Martin Kaymer teed off on the 11th hole and the trooper was holding traffic behind a walkway. Trooper Goodin allegedly told Lineberry, whose job was to drive Maltbie around the course, to stay put. He refused. An Associated Press reporter who witnessed the incident heard Lineberry tell a trooper, 'I'm supposed to get the cart to Roger.' A trooper, just inches from Lineberry's face, responded: 'When a state trooper tells you to stop, . THAT'S what you're supposed to do'. Another officer, Trooper C.A. Smith, arrested Lineberry. He reportedly asked for the names of . witnesses, and three people in the gallery immediately handed him their . business cards. At the center of the battle: The driver for NBC analyst Roger Maltbie (pictured) is accused of running over a highway patrolman with a golf cart at the US Open . Lineberry was taken to Moore County jail and charged with felony assault on a law enforcement officer; felony hit and run; driving while impaired; and resist, obstruct and delay, according . to North Carolina Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Pam Walker. She said a magistrate gave Lineberry a $3,000 secured bond. He posted bond Saturday night. Trooper Ryan A. Goodin was treated at the SHP medical trailer for a minor leg injury and released. Walker said Trooper Goodin is assigned to the Statesville Office and has been one of approximately 170 troopers assisting with security at the U.S. Open Championships. Dan Higgins, a spokesman for NBC's Golf Channel, told fayobserver.com late Saturday the broadcasting company had not seen the incident report and had no comment.","Thomas Lineberry, 59, drove NBC Sports analyst Roger Maltbie's golf cart at Pinehurst Golf Course, North Carolina on Saturday .

"They are known as the ships of the desert which makes it all the more surprising that the remains of a giant camel have been discovered in the high arctic. Bone fragments of the shaggy creature were found on Canada’s Ellesmere Island -  the furthest north the species has ever been discovered. They reveal that the creature must have roamed the frozen northern forests around 3.5 million years ago and that it was 30 per cent larger than its modern counterparts. Although the region where the fragments were found would have been between 14C to 22C warmer than today, the land would have still been covered with snow for up to nine months of the year. Artist's impression of the camels that lived in the Arctic - which was at least 14C warmer than it is now . Bone fragments of the shaggy creature (pictured) were found on Canada's Ellesmere Island . Scientists claim the discovery may change the way we think of the camels, suggesting they were originally ‘adapted to living in an Arctic forest environment’ instead of their present day habitats. Traits found in modern camels, such as their humps which serve as a fat store, would have benefited their ancestors during the deep winters when food was scarce. Other camel characteristics that would have been useful in the frozen conditions include the species’ wide flat feet, which support the animal on loose sand in the same way that a snowshoe helps a person walk on snow. Their large eyes would also have helped the prehistoric camels forage during months of Arctic darkness. In total, 30 bone fragments from a tibia, or lower-leg bone, were recovered 750 miles further north than the species has previously ever been found. ‘This is an important discovery because it provides the first evidence of camels living in the high arctic region,’ said Dr Natalia Rybczynski, a palaeontologist with the Canadian Museum of Nature, who led the field expeditions in Canada’s Arctic. Scientists found the bone fragments 750 miles further north than the species has ever been found before . Scientists claim the discovery may change the way we think of the camels, suggesting they were originally 'adapted to living in an Arctic forest environment' ‘It extends the previous range of camels in North America northward by about 1,200 km and suggests that the lineage that gave rise to modern camels may have been originally adapted to living in an Arctic forest environment.’ Camels originated in North America about 45 million years ago, and dispersed to Eurasia by seven million years ago using the Bering land bridge that joined modern-day Alaska to Russia. ‘We now have a new fossil record to better understand camel evolution...and the simplest explanation for this pattern would be that Paracamelus [ancient camel species] originated there,’ said Dr Rybczynski. ‘So perhaps some specialisations seen in modern camels, such as their wide flat feet, large eyes and humps for fat may be adaptations derived from living in a polar environment.’ Dr Mike Buckley, from the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, helped to extract collagen from the bone fragments and to compare them to 37 modern species . Physical characteristics suggested the fossil fragments belonged to the group of cloven-hoofed animals known as arteriodactyls, which includes cows, pigs and camels. Scientists from the University of Manchester extracted collagen - protein found in mammals - from the bone fragment and compared it to 37 modern species. Results of tests, published in the journal Nature Communications, found an almost identical match between the now extinct animal and a modern-day dromedary, or one-humped camel. It also had similarities with the Ice-Age Yukon giant camel. Dr Mike Buckley from the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, said DNA degrades much faster than collagen, and so cannot be used to identify prehistoric remains. ‘This is the first time that collagen has been extracted and used to identify a species from such ancient bone fragments,’ he said. ‘The fact the protein was able to survive for three and a half million years is due to the frozen nature of the Arctic. This has been an exciting project to work on and unlocks the huge potential collagen fingerprinting has to better identify extinct species from our preciously finite supply of fossil material.’","Bone fragments from a giant camel were found on Ellesmere Island .

"An Italian woman is suing the studio behind children's cartoon Peppa Pig as she claims a character that shares her name has left her 'damaged'. Gabriella Capra, 40, from Perugia, says she is being ridiculed by friends and colleagues over character Gabriella Goat – Capra being the Italian word for goat. Ms Capra has now taken the British company behind Peppa Pig to court, demanding 100,000 euros (£79,850). Baaa-d reaction: An Italian woman is suing Peppa Pig's creators for £79,850 after an episode featured a little goat who shares her name . Peppa Pig is made by Astley Baker Davies animation studios in London, but the children's show about Peppa and her animal friends has become a firm favourite around the globe, including in Italy. A recent episode sees the Pig family visit Italy on holiday, where they encounter the Goat family and Peppa befriends Gabriella Goat, which in the Italian version is Gabriella Capra. Since it aired in Italy, the real-life Gabriella Capra, a businesswoman, has become the butt of every joke among her peers, and has turned to a consumer's advocacy group in Milan which has filed a civil suit against Astley Baker Davies. 'Since this episode came out on the small screen she has been the frequent object of derisive jokes by friends and colleagues,' the National Foundation of Consumers told The Telegraph. Ms Capra claims she has become 'a frequent object of derisive jokes by friends and colleagues' since the episode showing Peppa Pig on holiday in Italy aired . The organisation claims the London studios should be held responsible for failing to protect Ms Capra 'who holds a serious job with many responsibilities and who finds herself innocently exposed to public hilarity.' The National Foundation of Consumers claims Ms Capra has a case as Peppa Pig does not include a disclaimer in the show noting that any similarities with real life people is coincidental, a representative told the Telegraph. Peppa Pig, an animated series about a four-year-old piglet and her family, originally aired in Britain in 2004, and has since grown to beocme a global phenomenon. So far, four seasons have been aired, and the show is currently broadcast in 180 territories.","Gabriella Capra, 40, is suing the studio behind Peppa Pig .

"Accused: ex-Dane County sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, pictured, is accused of killing his wife . A retired sheriff's deputy recently diagnosed with ALS is accused of murdering his wife, who was responsible for raising more than $20,000 to help him battle the disease. Authorities say ex-Dane County deputy Andrew P. Steele shot and killed 39-year-old Ashlee C. Steele and her sister, Kacee M. Tollefsbol, 38, of Lake Elmo, on Friday in the couple's Fitchburg, Wisconsin, home. The Dane County Medical Examiner determined both deaths were homicides. Fitchburg Police were called to the couple's home in the 3000 block of Yarmouth Greenway Drive about 12:15 p.m. Friday and discovered one woman dead at the scene. A second was gravely injured and rushed to hospital where she later died. Police also found Steele inside the home and he was treated for non-life-threatening injuries consistent with a suicide attempt. He was arrested in connection with the double homicide. As of Sunday, no charges had been filed against him, according to Twincities.com, and no motive has been released for the slayings. The Steeles had two children, who have been placed with family members out of state. Tollefsbol and her husband had four children. Dane County Sheriff David Mahoney said Ashlee and Kacee's grandmother died the same day they were killed. Steele was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an incurable neurodegenerative disease also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, on June 4. His wife had been spearheading a fundraiser called 'Tough As Steele - Taking Down ALS' on the website Give Forward, in a bid to raise money for medical and other expenses. The family said they were struggling financially after Steele became too ill to work in May. Scroll down for video . Family: The couple had two children, and had been together for 26 years. Police have not released a motive . Tragic: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead on Friday, leaving six children behind between them . Young love: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . The fundraiser for Steele, which appeared to have been removed from Give Forward as of Sunday, described his journey since he was diagnosed. 'Earlier this year, Andy noticed a twitching in his arm muscles that wouldn't stop. Eventually his speech became impaired with slurring and difficulty articulating his words,' the fund-raising website said. It had got so bad, the website said, that teh muscle-twitrching was never-ending and he couldn't even chew his food. As of Saturday, August 23, supporters had raised nearly $23,000 from 266 donations toward the $75,000 goal of the fundraiser, according to Twincities.com. There were 62 days left to raise the full amount. Speaking to NBC15 in Madison earlier this month Steele said: 'I never would have expected the type of reaching out people have done. People that have donated, people that I don't even know very well, I haven't seen or talked to in years. It's hard to describe that.' Ashlee Steele was listed as the team captain and funds manager on the website, where she was descibed as 'the love of his life.' The couple had been together for 26 years after meeting as 12-year-olds in Michigan and following each other to the University of Wisconsin in Madison. They married in 1998 and had two children, Jack, and Rachael. Steele had poured buckets of ice on his friends and family following his diagnosis in the now viral 'ice bucket challenge.'","Authorities say ex-Dane County deputy Andrew P.

"Mixing alcohol with energy drinks to get a bigger hit could be more harmful than research currently suggests, claims a leading psychologist. Clubbers who knock back vodka and drinks such as the massively popular Red Bull may have been falsely reassured by laboratory studies that don’t reflect ‘real world’ use, says Professor Peter Miller. He said concerns are growing about the harms that may arise from drinkers mixing alcohol and energy drinks which enable them to drink for longer and achieve ‘higher levels of intoxication’. Be careful: A Vodka and Red Bull is believed to be more harmful than first thought . Surveys show around three out of four college students in Europe and the US regularly indulge in such combinations. But the role played by energy drinks is under-researched and much of the work has only studied the effects of mixing low levels of alcohol with a single energy drink, said Prof Miller, associate professor of psychology at Deakin University in Australia. Although some researchers have concluded ‘we should not be concerned about the risks’, many of them have been funded by the makers of Red Bull, he said. At a recent conference in Australia, four out of five researchers who presented research on alcohol and energy drinks had received financial support from Red Bull, says Prof Miller, writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) (must credit). They had been given funds to attend international conferences or for research and all concluded there was no evidence showing a combination of energy drinks and alcohol increased drinking or harm. Down in one? The Jagerbomb is a popular energy mixer drink to have these days - yet it's consequences are more negative than positive . However, studies looking at statistical links between certain forms of behaviour and drinkers mixing energy drinks and alcohol show they are more likely to consume bigger quantities of alcohol, engage in aggressive acts, get injured and drink-drive. Prof Miller said he was worried that research does not consider real world levels of consumption, because ethical concerns mean lab studies are restricted to testing the effects of a single alcoholic drink and a single energy drink - equivalent to a strong cup of coffee. However, about 40 per cent of people on city streets in Australian on Friday and Saturday nights are heavily intoxicated and nearly a quarter will have drunk more than two energy drinks, he said.Current research has failed to prove the stimulant effect doesn’t fuel intoxication and increase the risk of alcohol-related injuries and assaults, he said. But ‘reassuring results’ have come mainly from researchers giving talks at conferences where ‘audience may not be aware of the extent of their industry sponsorship’, said Prof Miller. He said ‘I am not implying a causal relationship here, simply an association.’ ‘There are concerns about the role that Red Bull is playing, especially in supporting conference attendance of researchers whose findings and conclusions are favourable. ‘Having the same speakers funded to attend conferences around the world by a company with strong financial interests raises questions of propriety and the presentation of research findings being used as a commercial marketing strategy’ he added. Only the independent researchers have argued that more studies are needed to assess the risks.Prof Miller said ‘It is critical that the public can be confident in the findings of research on these products. Conference organisers should require researchers working on energy drinks to declare whether they have received research funding or unrestricted grants, or financial support to attend meetings or conferences.’","Mixing energy drinks with alcohol can lead to violence and intoxication .

"Conclusions: Sir William McKay, a former House of Commons clerk, has said that more needs to be done to ensure English MPs have more control over England-only policies . Laws that affect England alone should no longer be passed in the Commons without the consent of a majority of English MPs, an inquiry has concluded. The changes are designed to end the problem of unpopular measures affecting England, but not Scotland, being approved only with the support of Scottish MPs. In 2004, for example, Tony Blair pushed through tuition fees for England even though most English MPs voted against the policy. It passed only because Scottish Labour MPs packed the lobbies in favour of the move – despite the fact tuition fees would not apply north of the border because the devolved executive there had rejected the plan. An independent commission, led by former House of Commons clerk Sir William McKay, has said more needs to be done to ensure English MPs have better control. The report was commissioned by the Cabinet Office last year, and ministers will now consider whether to implement its conclusions. It calls for a compromise ‘double-lock’ system, under which laws that apply in England alone are approved first by English MPs before they go to a vote before the whole Commons, which comprises MPs of all four nations of the UK. The report suggests any England-only laws should first be considered by a committee made up of MPs representing English constituencies. Laws would not go forward unless they achieved the support of this committee, whose make-up should reflect the balance of parties in England. The legislation would then be voted on by all MPs in the Commons – be they English, Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish. This is to ensure that MPs from other countries are not relegated to ‘second class’ status. Greater English voice: Sir William's commission suggests laws that apply in England alone are approved first by English MPs before they go to a vote before the whole House of Commons . So, in effect, every law would have to be supported by both a representative majority of English MPs and a majority of all of Britain’s MPs. The new regime is designed to solve the so-called ‘West Lothian’ question, which asks why it is that Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish MPs have the same right to vote at Westminster as any English MP now that large areas of policy are devolved to national parliaments and assemblies. Many Conservatives have called for purely ‘English votes for English laws’, with MPs from other nations barred from voting on such issues. But Labour says to do that would undermine the Union. The party is also concerned that, because it often relies on Scottish MPs for a majority at Westminster, English votes for English laws could make governing impossible. Tuition fees: Tony Blair pushed the policy through for England even though most English MPs voted against the policy, by using Scottish Labour MPs to back him in the vote . Now Sir William’s commission has unveiled a compromise which maintains the integrity of the UK but provides a greater English voice. He said: ‘Surveys have shown that people in England are unhappy about the existing arrangements, and support change. There is a feeling that England is at a disadvantage, and that it’s not right that MPs representing the devolved nations should be able to vote on matters affecting England. ‘The status quo clearly cannot be sustained. Our proposals retain the right of a UK-wide majority to  make the final decisions where they believe UK interests or those of a part of the UK other than England should prevail.’ A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘We will give the report very serious consideration before we respond.’","Independent commission suggests English MPs to have extra committees .

"Justification: Cressida Dick has written to the Society of Editors justifying the Met's investigation and methods . The officer in charge of Scotland Yard’s inquiries in the wake of  the phone-hacking scandal  has been forced to defend her force’s tactics. Questions have been raised over the scope of Operation Elveden, the multi-million pound criminal inquiry into alleged bribes paid by journalists to public officials, after it targeted police officers who have ‘leaked’ information with no payment involved. Those concerns follow mounting  controversy over the dawn arrests of journalists – including an ex-editor who was seven months pregnant – and reporters left facing many months before discovering whether they will face charges. The arrests have also prompted fears, after the Leveson inquiry, that informal contact between police officers and the Press is being outlawed. Now Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick has written to the Society of Editors justifying the Met’s investigations and methods. In her unsolicited letter explaining the Elveden operation she insists: ‘The investigations being carried out do not mean that the Met wants or intends to stop officers talking to journalists.’ Defending the much-criticised ‘7am door knocks’, Miss Dick says there are ‘sound operational reasons for the times of day we elect to arrest people’. Miss Dick said there was ‘genuine concern’ by police over the time those arrested have been on bail but said there have been ‘millions of emails, documentation, complex communications data and trails of financial transactions that require painstaking analysis’. She concluded: ‘An unintended and, I hope, short-term consequence of this may be a negative effect on relations between police and journalists. ‘This is unfortunate but in no way undermines the value the Metropolitan Police Service puts on the role of a free and investigative Press in a democratic society – indeed this investigation is the result of such journalism. We want open, professional and trusting relationships between our officers and journalists.’ Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said: ‘While I am glad she has recognised the need to give an explanation, areas of concern remain. ‘We should all recognise that the police sometimes have a difficult job to do, but early-morning knocks on the doors of journalists still require some justification.’","Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick has written to the Society of Editors .

"It was one of the most star-studded weddings of the year  and since tying the knot to George Clooney in a three-day wedding, Amal Alamuddin has secured her status as one of the world's favourite style icons. The Lebanese-born lawyer, who has shot from relative obscurity to most envied woman in the world overnight, wowed with a wedding wardrobe packed with the likes of Oscar de la Renta, Dolce and Gabbana and Prada. Today, pictures of the 36-year-old's wedding dress were finally revealed in all their glory after teasing us all weekend with her stunning selection of designer looks from Alexander McQueen,  Giambattista Valli and Stella McCartney. Scroll down for video . Impeccable wardrobe: Amal Alamuddin tied the knot with Hollywood heartthrob George Clooney this weekend wearing a bespoke Oscar de la Renta gown embellished with diamente and pearls; it rounded off a weekend of showstopping designer outfits . Amal wore bespoke Oscar de la Renta for her marriage to Mr Clooney and looked picture-perfect in the gown. The French lace gown was embroidered with diamante and pearls and featured a circular train, while the wide neckline scooped just off her shoulders. The timeless and elegant dress  will no doubt inspire a thousand copy cat looks. 'He's such an elegant designer and such an elegant man,' she told People. While the exact price of the dress was kept under wraps, a ready-to-wear creation by the coveted designer, who also designed Kate Bosworth's wedding gown, starts from £6,000 and it's thought that this bespoke design could have cost in excess of £10,000. Her wedding jewellery was more simple and consisted of natural pearl earrings with square-cut diamond accents. These were a gift from her parents, Baria and Ramzi Alamuddin. Made to measure: Renowned designer Oscar de la Renta custom-made Amal's stunning French lace gown. While the exact price of the dress is unknown, a ready-to-wear creation by the coveted designer starts from £6,000 .

Stellar in Stella: Amal looked chic in head-to-toe Stella McCartney as she arrived at Venice City Hall holding hands with George . The day after her wedding, on Monday, the couple made their union official in a 10-minute civil ceremony at Venice City Hall. Amal looked chic in £450 Stella McCartney tailored, wide-leg trousers and a navy and cream top, both of which were bespoke, of course. Completing the outfit, Amal wore McCartney's 'Beckett' clutch bag and a wide-brim hat. The day before she wore the weekend's most colourful creation - a Giambattista Valli Haute Couture minidress, which she wore for her first appearance as Mrs Clooney on Sunday. A gown by the designer costs around £3,000. Colourful creation: The lawyer wore a beautifully ornate Giambattista Valli Haute Couture minidress for her first appearance as Mrs Clooney on Sunday .

Flattering: The mini dress featured a structured skirt with subtle high-low hemline, which showcased her toned and tanned legs . The made-to-measure design from the Italian designer's AW14 Haute Couture collection was beautifully embellished with beaded blossom set against white macrame. She completed the look with a pair of the Rome-born designer's 'Specchio' pointed-toe slingbacks. At the glamorous pre-wedding dinner, she took a tip from British royalty and wore a custom-made dress by Alexander McQueen, the same designer that the Duchess of Cambridge wore for her actual wedding. Red hot! For her pre-wedding dinner, Amal wore custom-made Alexander McQueen, which also featured a high-low hemline . The eye-catching scarlet gown, which perfectly complemented Amal's dark hair and eyes, was adapted from a Resort 2011 collection design, which Michelle Obama wore to a state dinner in 2011. Amal hinted at her stylish weekend wardrobe when she landed in Venice on Friday wearing a monochrome striped dress by Italian design duo, Dolce & Gabbana, which she teamed with cut-out slingbacks and Prada shades. Dresses by D&G can range in price from £1,500-£4,750. And with Hollywood's finest (as well as Vogue editor Anna Wintour) watching from the wings, is it any surprise that Amal pulled out all the style stops? Fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Amal is surely now the First Lady of Hollywood? She has got the high-profile hubby, has her own amazing career, will now of course be enlisted to help with charities and has the most incredible designer wardrobe. 'She has given us a glimpse of what to expect from her when dressing for occasions in the space of a few days: her monochrome Dolce & Gabbana arrival outfit demonstrates her ultra chic travelling wardrobe, the stand-out red McQueen dress was sexy eveningwear done to perfection, the post-wedding Giambattista Valli couture mini-dress shows how she does short and sassy, and the trouser-and-top combo for their civil ceremony was her answer to chic, well-tailored classic dressing. 'Not to mention the most exquisite bespoke Oscar de la Renta wedding gown, equipped with diamantes and pearls. This is the kind of dress women dream about. It was truly a masterpiece. 'Women will want her wardrobe, and they will try and emulate her looks. She's aspirational and has proven to be a style icon in the making, always wearing the clothes rather than them wearing her. She wears couture exactly as it's meant to be worn - fitted down to the last millimetre and with confidence. 'What a women! What a clever woman!' The Duchess of Cambridge may have a contender.

"Polling staff have been warned to expect ‘confrontational behaviour’ at the end of one of the most bitterly fought political campaigns in Scottish history. Almost 3.5 million people will attend polling stations between 7am and 10pm on Thursday – and with tensions running high, staff have been briefed to prepare for ‘serious disturbances’. The record turnout is expected to lead to massive queues and concerns have been raised that 'militant voters’ – many of whom have never participated in an election – will create a ‘protest’ atmosphere. Scroll down for video . Police Scotland have cancelled all leave as the force prepares a massive security operation at polling stations across the country . Electoral staff have been warned to expect 'serious disturbances' at polling stations as the campaign between Yes and No supporters gets increasingly bitter . All police leave has been cancelled as a massive security operation is mounted at each of the country’s 2,608 polling places. In anticipation of possible disorder sparked by the referendum result, officers have also been banned from taking ‘rest days’ on Friday. In recent weeks the debate has reached boiling point, with abuse, vandalism and threats of violence being doled out by both sides. East Renfrewshire Labour MP Jim Murphy suspended his tour of the country at the end of last month after what he described as ‘co-ordinated abuse’ from Yes campaigners, which included being pelted with eggs in Kirkcaldy, Fife. The Electoral Management Board for Scotland has issued all polling staff with a 58-page referendum handbook. This states: ‘It is possible station staff will encounter difficult situations or be faced with confrontational behaviour.’ It adds: ‘It is essential that polling stations are run in a calm, orderly manner.’ Almost 3.5 million voters are expected to attend polling stations, a record turnout in Scottish history. Postal votes are already being counted at stations like this in Edinburgh . Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said: ‘Our priority is to ensure public safety and security’ Staff are warned ‘not to become engaged in an argument’ and presiding officers are told they must contact the police any major problems arise. The presiding officer is empowered to order a person’s removal from the polling station but, even in the most extreme cases, they are meant to offer the person a chance to cast their vote first. Advice is also offered to staff about what to do in the event of a bomb scare. They are told that, if forced to leave the premises, they must establish a ‘temporary polling station’ at a ‘safe distance’. Staff are also advised to be patient with young, first-time voters. The handbook states: ‘The referendum is the first national electoral event at which 16 and 17-year-olds are able to vote. ‘As result, you may have a higher than usual number of voters who need some additional assistance from you to understand the process.’ A senior police source disclosed last night that teams of officers had been working behind the scenes to gather intelligence on possible voting day disruptions. The source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘This vote will bring out a great number of people who have never voted before and who don’t know the protocols of voting stations and behaviour in or near places where the public vote. Hundreds of festival goers showed their support for the union next to the Auld Acquaintance Cairn in Gretna as the countdown to voting entered the last few days . ‘Many of them will be from the more militant social backgrounds who tend to turn up at protests and football casual type incidents. ‘With that as a backdrop, police have been infiltrating and gathering intelligence to counter any organised disruption. ‘With recent incidents showing loud, animated opposition, I imagine there could be more trouble than usual.’ Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said: ‘The referendum is a significant event which is expected to attract a higher than normal turnout. ‘Policing arrangements are well in hand and will be appropriate and proportionate. ‘Our priority is to ensure public safety and security.’ Around 97 per cent of the country’s 4.42 million eligible voters have registered to vote, and at least 3.5 million are expected to attend polling stations. By contrast, in the 2011 Scottish parliament elections which bought the SNP to power, turnout was only 50.6 per cent. Chief counting officer Mary Pitcaithly has urged voters to help prevent overcrowding at polling stations by going to vote during working hours if possible. She said: ‘Polling places are busiest during the early morning and in the evening as people vote on their way to and from work.’ Polls must close at 10pm, but anyone who begins queuing before then must be allowed to cast their vote. The official handbook states: ‘If the polling station is too small to accommodate all the voters in the queue, a member of the team should mark the end of the queue by positioning themselves there.’","Polling staff warned to expect 'serious disturbances' at polling stations .

"A 64-year-old man miraculously survived with his head trapped underneath his overturned snowmobile for 20 hours overnight in running water as the temperature fell to 13 below freezing. Volunteer rescuers close to the Canadian border in Maine, discovered Paul Lessard lying in a stream with his head underneath the heavy machine's rear storage rack at 7.45am on Wednesday morning. He had been stuck there since around noon the previous day and temperatures had fallen to 8F (-13C) overnight. Although conscious he was showing signs of hypothermia. Survivor: Paul Lessard, 64, (centre) spent 20 hours trapped underneath his snowmobile before being rescued by volunteers Phil Corriveau and his son Tyler . Mr Lessard, known locally as 'Moses, had overturned the machine and landed in a watery ditch adjacent to the trail after setting off for a ride near Black lake in Maine's St John Plantation on Tuesday morning. He was eventually found by Phil Corriveau, owner of the local Arctic Cat snowmobile dealership, and his son Tyler, who had volunteered to join the search. Speaking to Maine's Bangor Daily News, Mr Corriveau said: 'We saw a track that went in but that did not come back out. 'I was pretty sure it was an Arctic Cat track, so I told my son, ""Let’s go see."" We could not see [Lessard] at all, The sled was on top of him. 'He moved his arm and said, ""you found me.” We told him to hang on.' Mr Lessard crashed as he rode the snowmobile near Black Lake, close to the Canadian border in Maine . Tyler Corriveau called wardens on his cellphone and the two men attempted to move the sled to free Lessard, but it was too heavy. They managed to shovel away enough snow to free Lessard’s head. Mr Corriveau added: 'It’s just plain luck we found him there. It was only 8 degrees this morning.' Mr Lessard of Milford, Massachusetts, had been reported missing around 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday by his friend Nelson Gagnon who was expecting to meet him for supper. The initial search was called off at 2.30am. Mr Lessard was taken to Northern Maine Medical Center in Fort Kent and subsequently transferred by ambulance to Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor where he was in stable condition.","Volunteer rescuers discovered Paul Lessard lying in a stream .

"The Scottie dogs which stole the show at the spectacular Commonwealth Games opening ceremony in Glasgow did not get quite as warm a reception with some Malaysian politicians. The animals which led each team in the parade of athletes at the event in Celtic Park proved a hit on Twitter - but have earned the ire of officials in the Islamic country as dogs are considered unclean by some Muslim scholars. During the parade of athletes, each team was led by a Scots man or woman in tweeds walking a Scottish terrier wearing a jacket bearing the name of the country. Scroll down for video .

However, Mohamad Sabu, the deputy president of the opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party said: 'Malaysia and all Islamic countries deserve an apology from the organiser. Mohamad Sabu, deputy president of the opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party called for an apology and said the dogs were 'disrespectful' to Muslims . 'This is just so disrespectful to Malaysia and Muslims – especially as it happened during Ramadan,' he added, according to the Daily Telegraph. 'Muslims are not allowed to touch dogs, so the organiser should have been more aware and sensitive on this issue. It is hoped this incident can teach other Western countries to be more respectful in the future.' Dato Ibrahim Bin Ali, a far-Right politician, former MP and founder and president of Malay supremacist group Perkasa called the use of the dogs 'shameful' and 'offensive'. A Glasgow 2014 spokesman said there have been no complaints about the dogs from any of the nations taking part. This short-legged dog was originally bred to hunt prey such as badgers and foxes, and as a result is a stubborn and brave animal. Their independence and intelligence have drawn many dog lovers to the breed, but others find the Scottie's aloofness less than endearing.

"An Islamic TV channel has been fined £85,000 after it broadcast a hate preacher to instructing muslims to kill those who insult Prophet Mohammed live on live television. Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom reprimanded Al Ehya Digital Televison, which runs the Islamic channel Noor TV for allowing its presenter to tell viewers it was their duty to murder non-Muslims  during a phone in show. The channel broadcasts both in the UK and internationally mostly in Urdu but also English and Punjabi and is aimed at young British Muslims. Offensive: Allama Muhammad Farooq Nizami told viewers that it was their 'mission' to 'protect the sanctity of our beloved Lord' The offending show was broadcast on May 3 last year and featured the presenter Allama Muhammad Farooq Nizami taking phone-in from audience members around the world. Mr Nizami answered questions about a wide range of issues and personal conduct relating to Islam and Islamic teachings. But following a question from a Pakistani caller asking what the 'punishment' should be for those who disrespect the Prophet, his answer was that they 'should be eliminated.' Speaking directly into the camera Mr Nazimi said: 'One has to choose one’s own method. 'Our way is the peaceful way but when someone crosses the limits, faith-based emotions are instigated...The mission of our life is to protect the sanctity of our beloved Lord. 'May Allah accept us wherever there is a need [to kill a blasphemer]. We are ready and should be ready at all times [to kill a blasphemer]' The regulator judged that these comments were 'likely to encourage or incite the commission of crime or to lead to disorder.' It also said it was concerned that . young people watching the show could become 'radicalised' or take . 'violent and criminal action as a result of watching videos of Muslims . with extreme views.' It . considered the remarks to be so inflammatory they could have inspired a . repeat of the murder of Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gough, who was killed . after Islamic clerics condemned his film which criticised the treatment . of Muslim women. The regulator said is was concerned that young Muslims watching the extremist views might become radicalised . In its ruling, Ofcom criticised Birmingham based-Al Ehya for not taking the comments seriously enough after concerns were initially raised by the broadcast watchdog. Noor TV has however remained defiant and has not broadcast an apology for the comments, instead opting to broadcast a 'clarification' six months later. Ofcom said: 'The Licensee [Al Ehya] has not at any point broadcast any form of apology for, or condemnation of Mr Nizami’s remarks, and neither on air nor in correspondence with Ofcom has the Licensee expressed its unequivocal regret that these comments were broadcast. 'The Licensee regretted only in its submissions that the presenter’s comments ""may have been misinterpreted"" and that he expressed his own political views during the programme. 'Taking all these factors into account, Ofcom was concerned that the Licensee has still not recognised the gravity of the statements made by Mr Nizami.' But despite this the regulator decided only to give Al Ehya a third of the full £250,000 fine which it could have enforced because it said it wished to protect the station's right to 'freedom of expression.' In it's judgement it added: 'If any financial penalty was to be so high that its effect would be to close a service down, then it might be a disproportionate interference with the Licensee’s and the audience’s right to freedom of expression in particular and exceed the purposes of imposing a penalty. 'Ofcom therefore carefully took this point into account and carefully weighed it in reaching its decision on the proportionality of the financial penalty.' The fine announced today, comes three years after Al Ehya was fined £75,000 for appealing for viewers to donate money in return for 'prayers or the receipt of a “special gift” of earth from the tomb of Prophet Mohammed.' Al Ehya Digital Television were not available for comment on the matter. Last December Radio Asian Fever, in Leeds, was fined £4,000 for breaching broadcasting rules in programmes involving a presenter called ‘Sister Ruby Ramadan’. She told listeners homosexuals should be beaten and tortured, adding: ‘Torture them; punish them; beat them and give them mental torture.’ Takbeer TV, based in Nottingham, has been found in breach of the code twice in 18 months for programmes which denigrated a minority Muslim sect.","Allama Muhammad Farooq Nizami told viewers live on-air that those who caused offence to the Prophet 'should be eliminated'

"Parents have been warned of the dangers of 'highly toxic' essentials oils by a doctor who says they can cause serious problems ranging from convulsions to corneal ulcers if used wrongly. Essential oils such as eucalyptus, clove and peppermint are commonly found in decongestant products such as Olbas Oil, and used by parents on children suffering from winter coughs and colds. Reassured by the list of natural-sounding ingredients, parents are happy to sprinkle them on a child's pillow, in their bath or on a tissue. But paediatric consultant Hester Yorke, . who works at a busy central London emergency department, says she has . dealt with a string of cases where children and babies have required . hospital treatment after drinking or otherwise ingesting . harmless-sounding oils. John Oliver, three, needed emergency treatment in hospital after he drank Olbas Oil and got it in his eye, right . A doctor has warned of the dangers of children accidentally ingesting products containing essential oils - this photograph shows chemical burns caused by Olbas Oil which show up green under blue light . Dr Yorke, 39, who works at the emergency department at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, is calling on the manufacturers of such oils to put a child-proof cap on the bottles to reduce the numbers of young - and old - patients needing urgent treatment after misusing the products. She said: 'In the last five years we have seen at least 38 children, and probably more, who have presented having ingested, put in their eyes or up their nose some kind of essential oil-containing substance. 'These included Olbas Oil, Karvol, room diffuser liquids, liquid air freshener, citronella oil and other aromatherapy oils, and of these 38 children, six had significant clinical findings.' Dr Yorke said all 38 children were admitted to the ward for observation or required observation for at least six hours. She said of the six with 'significant' symptoms, two children had corneal ulcers, one had nervous system findings (drowsiness and unsteadiness walking), and three had breathing difficulties. The consultant, who is so concerned she is keeping a dossier of hospital admissions as a result of accidents with essential oils to strengthen her case for manufacturers, says the chief culprit is eucalyptus oil. At least 38 patients have been admitted to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London after accidentally ingesting essential oils . She said: 'Eucalyptus oil is particularly toxic - in Australia, where eucalyptus oil is more widely used, there have been reports of children who have drunk it presenting with convulsions. 'We often see children who have put it into their eyes or nose because the size and shape of the bottle makes it easy to mistake for eye or nose drops. 'And children who put it into their eyes are risking serious corneal damage at worst, and quite significant discomfort at best.' Children who suffer corneal ulcers will . need at least one course of antibiotics dropped directly into the eye, . as well as flushing with large quantities of saline solution. Drinking the oil can cause changes in . heart rhythm, such as tachycardia, where the heart rate speeds up, or . irregular heartbeats. A&E paediatric consultant Dr Hester Yorke has treated scores of children who have ingested essential oils and says parents must be aware of the dangers . Dr Yorke said she'd heard of cases where ingestion of essential oil had caused death, but said she had no direct evidence of it at the A&E department she worked in. Other side-effects can include breathing problems caused when the drops are put into the nose accidentally.  The oil acts as an irritant, which causes mucosal tissue to become inflamed and a dramatic increase in mucusal secretions. This can cause vomiting, which in turn can see the oil getting into the lungs. Dr Yorke says the problems are not confined to young patients. She said: 'Elderly patients have also been known to put it in their eyes because it's in such a small bottle. 'One elderly patient came in after her carer put it in her nose by mistake thinking it was nose drops.' And she said the 'natural' image of the oils could lull people into a false sense of security. 'These essential oils are seen as natural products so they are not thought of as medicines and are therefore not stored as medicines,' she said. 'People keep them in the last place they used them, which is often beside the bath or on the shelf by the child's bed. 'Given that if ingested, they have the potential to do really nasty things, I think the ones that are sold medically should be more clearly labelled and should have childproof caps so that a child can't take off the top. 'Kids get put off pretty quickly if they're struggling to take the top off and move on to something else. 'I would also like to see the other commonly sold essential oils coming with a childproof cap too. 'Parents must be warned that these products must treated as drugs, not as nice smelly stuff you put in the bath.' Three-year-old John Oliver, from Fulham, south west London, needed emergency treatment at the Chelsea and Westminster after he opened the bottle of Olbas Oil kept in his bedroom, sipped it and put some in his eye. His mother, Harriet, flushed out his eye with eye drops before ringing NHS Direct who told her she had to take him straight to A&E. She said: 'He's my third child so I thought I knew what was dangerous and what wasn't, but I had no idea Olbas Oil could cause problems, and had left it in his bedroom after sprinkling some on his pillow when I put him to bed. 'Later I heard crying from upstairs and when I ran up he told me he'd opened the bottle and put some in his eye and his mouth.' 'He's my third child so I thought I knew what was dangerous and what wasn't, but I had no idea Olbas Oil could cause problems.' - Harriet Oliver, whose son was admitted to hospital after putting oil in his eye . Mrs Oliver rang NHS Direct as a precaution and was shocked when they offered to send an ambulance, saying her son needed to be seen by a doctor within one hour. She took him to Chelsea and Westminster where he was seen by Dr Yorke, who said he had to have his eye washed out with two litres of saline solution before being checked to see if there was any corneal damage or residue from the oil. John also had to wear a heart monitor for several hours to see whether his heart rate would be affected by swallowing the Olbas Oil. Mrs Oliver said: 'It was all quite shocking and frightening - one minute I'd put him to bed with a blocked nose and the next minute we were in A&E having a  heart monitor strapped to him. 'Having his eye washed out was upsetting as I had to pin him down while the nurse flushed his eye with an enormous bottle of salt water and he screamed and screamed. 'We spent the night on the children's ward so his heart rate could be checked and luckily he was fine, but when I talked to my friends with children, none of them had heard that Olbas Oil could be so dangerous.' Figures from the Health & Safety Information Centre show that between April 2012 and March this year, 5,432 people were treated as inpatients after accidentally poisoning themselves with substances including essential oils. A spokesman for Lanes health care, manufacturer of Olbas Oil, said: 'We take this kind of incident very seriously and take on board all suggestions for ways we can improve our products. 'Olbas Oil is a safe and effective medicine when used as instructed and like all medicines must be kept out of sight and reach of children. 'We have emphasised this on the packaging which complies with all the necessary regulations and has been approved by the UK medicines authority (MHRA).'","Products made with essential oils can cause serious problems if ingested .

"Two healthcare assistants who abused elderly female patients on the geriatric ward of a hospital were jailed today. Akousa . Sakyiwaa, 38, was convicted of four counts of ill-treatment and neglect . of patients on Beech Ward at Whipps Cross University Hospital in . Leytonstone, east London, between February and April last year. Sharmila . Gunda, 36, was found guilty of one count of neglect and one count of . assault by beating an elderly patient in her care following a trial in . June. Behind bars: Akousa Sakyiwaa, 38, pictured left, . was jailed for 12 months for four counts of ill-treatment and neglect . of patients while Sharmila Gunda, 36, pictured right, was given a five . month prison sentence for one count of neglect and one count of assault . by beating an elderly patient in her care . Sakyiwaa, of Leytonstone, was jailed . for 12 months while Gunda, of Ilford, was given a five month prison . sentence at London's Snaresbrook Crown Court. Fellow . healthcare assistant Annette Jackson, 33, of Hounslow, west London, was . given a two month suspended sentence and ordered to complete 100 hours . unpaid work after being convicted of one count of ill-treatment or . neglect. Spared jail: Healthcare assistant Annette Jackson, 33, was given a two-month suspended sentence for neglecting patient Barbara Jones . Delivering his sentence, Judge Timothy Lamb QC said the women's actions had 'damaged patient trust' in the NHS. Addressing the defendants, Mr Lamb said: 'In short, by your offending you have let down your colleagues, you have damaged patient trust and you have undermined the quality of care for the elderly and vulnerable at Whipps Cross.' The three women were charged following a . Metropolitan Police inquiry into the hospital after a student nurse . acted as a whistleblower. The women would physically and verbally . abuse patients, often telling them to shut up, as well as handling them . in a rough and aggressive manner, police said. Sakyiwaa, of Leytonstone, Jackson, of . Hounslow; and Gunda, of Ilford, were responsible for looking after . elderly female patients with various physical and mental conditions . including dementia. June . Evans, who is wheelchair bound, was the only patient still alive or . well enough to come to court to give evidence against them. The other . patients are too ill or suffer from dementia. In . a statement read to the court, she said: 'Since the incident that took . place last year I have completely lost trust in the health service. The incidents occurred between February 27 to April 30 last year on Beech Ward at Whipps Cross Hospital in east London . 'I lost faith in my GP, the ambulance service and hospitals in general.' Ms Evans discharged herself from the . hospital following the assault and was in a state of distress when she . had to return to Whipps Cross for further treatment. 'I wanted to die,' she said. 'I thought why couldn't I have a heart attack and end it.' A police inquiry into alleged . offences committed against a health campaigner who highlighted failings . at a scandal-plagued hospital has been unable to identify those . responsible. Staffordshire . Police said it had finished detailed inquiries into offences reported . by Cure the NHS founder Julie Bailey, whose mother Bella died at . Stafford Hospital in 2007. Ms . Bailey, who battled to expose hundreds of needless deaths at the . hospital, moved out of Stafford earlier this year following the . desecration of her mother's grave. The . campaigner believes the threats made against her by some local people, . which also included on-line abuse, were politically-motivated. Officers . from Staffordshire Police, which will reopen its inquiry if new . evidence comes to light, are still appealing for information. In . a statement issued by the force, a police spokesman said: 'After seeing . media reports about alleged incidents, we immediately contacted Ms . Bailey to get further information. 'Detectives were made aware of a number of issues, including damage to flowers and vases at her mother's grave. 'Clearly, such offences are completely unacceptable. 'We . began an investigation which involved taking witness statements, . carrying out inquiries at incident locations and examining CCTV footage. 'We've . now finished our detailed inquiries and, at this stage, we have not . been able to recover evidence which could help us identify offenders.' A . public inquiry into 'appalling' failings at the Mid Staffordshire NHS . Foundation Trust, which published its final report in February, found . that hundreds of patients were mistreated at the trust between 2005 and . 2009. Previous reports into the Trust estimated that as many as 1,200 patients may have died needlessly while in its care. Administrators recommended last month that the Trust should be dissolved and some services at Stafford Hospital should be cut. In . a statement, Ms Bailey said she was disappointed people had seen fit to . abuse her for attempting to bring to light problems in the NHS. 'One . of the biggest problems at Mid Staffordshire is still the denial about . what happened and that is what's led to me being abused,' she said. Sakyiwaa was found guilty of holding a bed sheet over 87-year-old Joan Massett’s head and telling her she was dead. She . pushed Ms Massett’s breasts in another incident and forcefully twisted . her mouth which was both 'demeaning and completely unnecessary'. Sakyiwaa shouted at 88-year-old . patient Elizabeth Toussaint to force her to sit in a chair and slapped . Louise Hodges, 92, after cleaning her, the hearing was told. Jackson . was found guilty of one count of neglecting patient Barbara Jones, . while Gunda was found guilty of one charge of neglect and one charge of . assault by beating June Evans. Jurors . heard the healthcare assistants were arrested after a student nurse . Lucy Brown whistleblew on them following a placement on the ward last . Spring. John McNally, prosecuting, said: 'The conduct complained of simply had no place on any ward. It cannot be justified.' Snaresbrook . Crown Court heard 92-year-old Lily Oliver was admitted to the ward on . March 27, 2012, suffering from septic arthritis in her left knee. Mr . McNally told jurors: 'She was bed bound and extremely frail and it is . the expert’s professional opinion that she suffered from dementia and . wasn’t able to make her own decisions. 'During the time she was on Beech Ward she was under the care of Akousa Sakyiwaa. 'Lucy Brown described Akousa Sakyiwaa as being extremely rough with Lily Oliver. 'In the course of one encounter Lucy Brown noted that when Miss Oliver’s bandages were removed Miss Oliver said ‘mind my leg.’ 'After that Akousa Sakyiwaa grabbed her left knee with both her hands and pushed it towards Lucy Brown. 'This . caused her to scream in pain and turn pale before falling silent. That, . we say, is what constitutes ill treatment for that count.' Opening . the case, Mr McNally said: 'The prosecution case is they variously ill . treated patients either by positive actions towards them or by failing . to look after them when they should have. 'The defendants worked on a geriatric ward and were trusted to provide the most basic tasks. 'There is little doubt some of these would have been unpleasant and that elderly and demented patients could be obstructive. 'However, . this factor only serves to highlight the vulnerability of these . patients and outline the fact that providing care professionally was the . responsibility of each defendant. 'An entitlement for proper care should not be a matter of chance given at the whim of the carer.' The court heard the ward has since closed down following a Metropolitan Police investigation into alleged abuse. Barts . Health NHS trust, which runs the hospital, apologised to patients . following the verdicts and stressed it had a 'zero tolerance approach' to any form of neglect or ill-treatment. Co-defendants: Sharmila Gunda (left) Gunda was found guilty of one charge of neglect and one charge of . assault by beating June Evans  while Annette Jackson (right) was found guilty of one count of neglecting patient Barbara Jones . In a statement, the trust said: 'We . apologise unreservedly to the patients of Beech Ward and their families . for the indefensible failings in their treatment during their time in . our care. 'There can be no place under any circumstances for such behaviour in our trust or in the wider NHS.' It added that following an internal disciplinary investigation all three women had their contracts of employment terminated. Healthcare worker . Akousa Sakyiwaa placed a sheet over one patient's head and told her she was dead . It . added: 'We take a zero tolerance approach to any form of neglect or . ill-treatment of our patients and applaud the student nurses who showed . courage and integrity in raising the alarm. 'It . is the duty of every member of staff to report such behaviour and we . will actively encourage and support this through our whistleblowing . policy which is made clear to all staff on day one of their employment . with the Trust, with ongoing reminders to existing staff during regular . statutory and mandatory training. 'Moreover, . we will take action against any member of staff who turns a blind eye, . or fails to take immediate and appropriate action, if they witness any . form of abuse or negligence.' Barts . Health NHS Trust was issued with three formal warnings last week after . inspectors found 'unsafe' conditions at Whipps Cross including filthy . maternity wards and water placed out of the reach of elderly patients. The . trust had 'failed to protect the safety and welfare of patients' and . must now make 'urgent improvements' following unannounced inspections in . May and June, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said. Following the sentencing, Detective Sergeant Tammy Dempsey, from the Met's Community Safety Unit in Waltham Forest, said: 'These three women had a responsibility for the welfare of those who were under their care. 'The public and families of these elderly patients have a right to expect that they will be treated with respect and looked after in an appropriate manner. 'Gunda, Jackson and Sakyiwaa let everyone down and it's right that they have been found guilty at court. 'I would like to take this opportunity to thank those who had the courage to come forward and report these offences and give their evidence in court.'

"Al Qaeda fanatic: Whitehall sources say Abu Qatada should be handed over to the authorities in Jordan this weekend . The ten-year battle to deport Abu Qatada was finally nearing its conclusion last night. Preparations are in hand to put the hate preacher on a plane home early on Sunday. The farcical saga, which has enraged politicians and the public alike, has already cost £2million. Although ministers insist legal hurdles remain, Whitehall sources say the Al Qaeda fanatic should be handed over to the authorities in Jordan this weekend. The breakthrough follows yesterday’s adoption by the Middle Eastern state of a treaty that will  protect Qatada’s human rights. He has made this a condition of him voluntarily going home to face trial over his alleged involvement in a bomb plot. Last night Channel 4 News revealed he will be served with new papers for his deportation that give him 72 hours to appeal. If he honours his word he will be put on a flight home from RAF Northolt in West London. Last night security minister James Brokenshire said: ‘While further steps remain, our focus is on seeing Abu Qatada on a plane to Jordan at the earliest opportunity.’ Qatada – once dubbed Osama Bin Laden’s right hand man in Europe – has repeatedly used human rights laws to thwart his removal. He claimed his trial for plotting a terror attack would be unfair because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. Shock move: Earlier this year, Qatada said he would return home voluntarily when the treaty Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) agreed with Jordan is fully ratified . This argument, originally rejected by the British courts, was upheld by judges in Strasbourg. It forced Home Secretary Theresa May to seek new legal guarantees from Jordan that Qatada’s rights would not be breached. The case then began again in the British courts and was expected to take years. But, in a shock move earlier this year, Qatada said he would return home voluntarily when the treaty Mrs May agreed with Jordan is fully ratified. It explicitly rules out the use of any torture evidence. Movement: Security minister James Brokenshire said there is a focus 'on seeing Abu Qatada on a plane to Jordan at the earliest opportunity' It was published in the Jordanian government’s official gazette yesterday – confirming its status as law. Qatada, who has cost the taxpayer millions of pounds in housing benefit and other state handouts is behind bars in London’s Belmarsh prison. He was released on bail in mid-February but was returned to jail a few weeks later after a police raid on his home. Officers say he breached a bail condition which restricts use of mobile phones and other communication devices. A search found memory sticks containing jihadist propaganda and internet enabled mobile phones. Over the past eight years, Qatada’s lawyers have pocketed £864,944 in legal aid. Of this, the authorities have managed to claw back only £217,286 by selling assets belonging to the preacher. The cost to taxpayers of trying to boot him out has been a further £938,630 in the domestic courts, and £130,018 at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. This gives a net total of £1,716, 286. He has spent years in maximum security prisons, with every year inside costing taxpayers up to £60,000. 'While further steps remain, our focus is on seeing Abu Qatada on a plane to Jordan at the earliest opportunity' Security minister James Brokenshire . In May a court was told that Qatada and his family had complained that their taxpayer-funded house was too small and they did not have enough storage space. Judges heard that his family would join him in Jordan rather than stay behind in Britain. But officials are conscious that, despite his commitment to leave Britain, Qatada could still make a U-turn and lodge fresh legal appeals.","Farcical saga which has enraged politicians and public has cost £2m .

"Forget feminism: Laura Howard says women aren't as successful in business because they want to have children . Whether it's their views on immigration or admiration of Adolf Hitler, UKIP politicians are never far from controversy. Now a new supporter has spoken out in an attempt to refresh the image of her beloved party, although she may not have been entirely successful. UKIP follower Laura Howard has given an interview to The Debrief in which she said she hopes to debunk the myth that the party is a just 'bunch of old white men'. But in doing so, the 19-year-old student nurse from Birmingham could enrage many with her anti-feminist sentiments. She told Rosamund Urwin that she's against modern feminism because 'it’s gone almost beyond equality: they want women to have more rights than men. They want quotas for women in businesses and I don't agree with that.' She believes it isn't sex discrimination preventing women taking on more highly paid, powerful roles but their own life choices. 'I think the main reason behind that is that women want to have children and a family life,' she said of the male domination of company boards. She added that politics is also male dominated not because of a lack of opportunities for her gender, but because women are simply not as interested in it. 'If you look at someone like Theresa May, she's a really well-established politician. I just think women aren't as interested as sad as that is,' she said. Scroll down for video . Not interested: Laura says that the lack of women in politics is due to the female gender's lack of interest rather than unequal opportunities but she thoroughly admires Theresa May (pictured) The outspoken teenager's opinions echo those of UKIP leader Nigel Farage who said earlier this year that mothers are 'worth less' to employers in the City than men. He said that women can succeed in the industry as long as they are willing to 'sacrifice the family life'. Laura has been campaigning for UKIP for the last two years and stood to be a councillor in Quinton in Birmingham. She has ambitions to one day run for parliament and her converts to the party so far include many of her own family members. Mutual values: The outspoken teenagers opinions echo those of UKIP leader Nigel Farage (pictured) Where they once supported the Conservatives and Labour, she's now persuaded her parents and grandparents to vote UKIP. She said it was the party's animal rights and EU stance that attracted her to them. 'I am anti-the EU because I'm pro-democracy,' she says. She adds that she doesn't think of UKIP as far right but 'just something different.' The student believes the party has much to offer people her age as 'immigration affects jobs and house prices - those are things that really affect young people today.'

"Gross negligence: A police officer has been jailed for blowing up a suspect's testicles with a stun grenade like this one when the victim refused to leave his car . Swedish police used stun grenades to subdue a mother who refused to hand over her five-month-old son. The 30-year-old woman had armed herself with a knife when police entered her flat in Helsingborg, southern Sweden to aid social services with taking the child into care. She locked herself in a room with the baby boy and, after several hours of negotiation police judged her a threat to the child and called for backup. The incident took place earlier this . month when social services in Helsingborg requested police presence when removing the child from the woman’s care. The five-month-old boy is the third child to be taken from the woman, who has been in and out of employment for several years. When . social services ruled that her baby should also be taken into care she . made serious threats to staff and refused to cooperate, and as a result, . police were called in to help remove the child from her. The . initial police force had kicked a hole through the door to communicate . with the distressed mother, but she refused to let go of her son. When a squad team arrived at the scene, they decided to use stun grenades to subdue the woman. The grenades, also known as flash grenades, go off at up to 180 decibels temporarily paralysing the person they are fired at. The child was hospitalised and the woman was taken to a psychiatric clinic. Her legal representative claims police used unnecessary force. 'It . is very strange that police use stun grenades on a petite woman who . just tried to defend her child. 'She judged the actions of the police to . be unfair and feels she was facing an impossible power,’ lawyer Charlotte . Lagersten told Dagens Nyheter. When her two older children were taken . from her, a psychiatrist noted that they both ‘seemed safe and well . cared for’ and had a ‘warm and caring relationship’ with their mother. Unnecessary violence: Police were called to help social services take the five-month-old baby boy from the woman and used the stun grenade after it was deemed she was a threat to her own child (stock image) When it was ruled that her new-born should also be removed from her care, a psychologist who met with them wrote that the boy showed ‘an attachment to his mother which is rare to see today.’ ‘I am extremely critical to how the woman and her children have been treated,’ Ms Lagersten adds. ‘Social Services have chosen not to divulge any of the investigation or papers which have proven the woman’s ability to care for her children. ‘They have also completely disregarded the fact that the children at the time of going into care were physicially and mentally well. ‘In short, there are no legal grounds for taking them into care.’ The woman, who left psychiatric care on Thursda, has previously applied to have her other two children returned from foster care, but she has not been allowed to see them for 18 months.","Swedish police used stun grenade on woman taking baby into care .

"Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander has said 'political correctness' stops people speaking out against Christian persecution for fear of causing offence . Politicians should not let a ‘sense of embarrassment’ about religion stop them speaking out against persecution of Christians, a Labour frontbencher has said. Foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander said Christians are under growing attack around the world, and referred to Blair spin doctor Alastair Campbell’s phrase, ‘We don’t do God’. He said: ‘Perhaps through . . . some sense of embarrassment at “doing God” in an age when  secularism is more common, too many politicians seem to fear  discussing any matters relating to faith. 'So the growing persecution of Christians around the world remains a story that goes largely untold.’ The Labour shadow foreign secretary's calls follow a speech by Prince Charles last week in which the heir to the throne warned that Christianity was beginning to disappear from its birthplace because members and places of worship were being targetted. Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Alexander said: 'Across the world, there will be Christians this week for whom attending a church service this Christmas is not an act of faithful witness, but an act of life-risking bravery. That cannot be right and we need the courage to say so. 'People of all faiths and none should be horrified by this persecution. We cannot, and we must not, stand by on the other side in silence for fear of offence.' Mr Alexander, who is a Church of . Scotland follower, added that persecution of Christians should be viewed in the same way as anti-Seminism or Islamophobia, and not just opposed by lone voices. Speaking at an event for Middle East Christians, Prince Charles said that bridges between Islam and Christianity were being 'deliberately destroyed' and that Christianity was being driven from its birthplace . He said he had felt 'very personally' an attack on a Church of Scotland place of worship in September which killed 122 including the mother, nephew, niece, two uncles and other friends of the priest. Last week Prince Charles said that bridges between the Islamic and Christian communities he had worked to foster were being 'deliberately destroyed'. Speaking at an event for Middle East Christians in Clarence House, he said: ‘It seems to me that we cannot ignore the fact that Christians in the Middle East are increasingly being deliberately targeted by fundamentalist Islamist militants. ‘Christianity was literally born in the Middle East and we must not forget our Middle Eastern brothers and sisters in Christ.’ Others have also issued warnings on the issue, including Baroness Warsi who delivered a speech to the House of Lords last month on the 'mass exodus' of Christians from the Middle East, and former Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks. Mr Alexander's comments come in stark contrast to the Labour government's stance under Tony Blair, when Alastair Campbell famously said that the party 'doesn't do God'. Since retiring from politics Mr Blair himself has become a Roman Catholic, and says he was a believer while in office but was too afraid to admit it in case he was viewed as 'a nutter'. The article by Mr Alexander marks a shift towards religion in politics, with David Cameron being an active member of the Church of England - though he admits his faith can be patchy - and Ed Miliband saying he has a 'huge respect' for people who believe in God, despite being an atheist himself. Mr Alexander’s words were welcomed by Church leaders. The Rt Rev Lorna Hood, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, said: 'Too often these situations are ignored by politicians worried at offending someone. Such silence should be offensive to all who cherish the right to live safely in a pluralistic society.'","Douglas Alexander says more needs to be done in order to stop Christians in the Middle East being attacked and places of worship being targeted .

"A Bupa care home nurse who was discovered pulling a screaming resident's hair by a shocked colleague could face being struck off. Osironke Olugbile, 53, also barricaded residents in their rooms and dressed them in multiple incontinence pads so as not to disturb her during the night, it is alleged. She was caught by a healthcare assistant, identified as Mr 1, pulling the resident's hair to force her into bed. The nurse also layered incontinence pads in stacks of five and repeatedly switched off the call bell so that she could work undisturbed, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. Night nurse Osironke Olugbile at the Nursing and Midwifery Council for her hearing . Olugbile also left pensioners fully clothed over night so that she did not have to dress them in the morning at the Bupa-run Collingwood Court Nursing Centre in Clapham, south London, . Giving evidence Mr 1 said he was initially worried about making a complaint after Olugbile said she had a friend with supernatural powers. 'I was hesitant to report the issue to management because Ronke (Olugbile's nickname) would often comment that she has someone back home, in Africa, with supernatural powers who will do whatever she says, to the point of killing someone if necessary,' Mr 1 told the hearing. The tribunal found nearly all the allegations against Oligbile proved and she could now face being struck off the register. Robert Benzyne, for the NMC, told the panel that Mr 1 witnessed the abuse through the resident's room door after it had been left ajar on August 6, 2010. 'He approached room 59 where he heard screaming and shouting. The door to the room was ajar and he witnessed the registrant pulling Resident A's hair trying to get her to bed.' He also said that Olugbile would remove the stacked up incontinence pads before the day staff arrived. 'You have sought to abdicate yourself from any personal responsibility for your actions' Panel chairman, Clive Powell . Olugbile barricaded Patient F who was described as 'restless and aggressive' in his room, it was said. She also turned off the call bell between August 13 and August 15,  2010 and on several other occasions, preventing vulnerable patients from being able to contact the nurse's desk. Mr Benzyne said: 'He (her colleague) recalls that the bell had been switched off. The reason that was given to him about why the bell was switched off was that it prevented the bell disturbing her during the night. 'The registrant put the resident's day clothes on intending that they would be able to get up in the morning and they would already be changed and that would save time in order to clean them and get them ready for the day shift.' On another occasion she wrote that a patient 'enjoyed falling deliberately on to the floor and sliding from the chair' in their hospital passport. Finding all but one allegation against Olugbile proved NMC panel chairman Clive Powell said she was guilty of 'serious abuse', . 'The panel determined that some of your conduct in relation to the vulnerable residents at the Home amounted to serious abuse,' he said. 'The panel noted that you have not shown any remorse or regret. You have denied these charges from the beginning and have sought to blame others and accuse them of lying. 'You have sought to abdicate yourself from any personal responsibility for your actions,' said Mr Powell. The nurse, who claimed she is the victim of a 'conspiracy', now faces an anxious wait as her hearing has been adjourned for the second time. When the hearing resumes next year, the panel will determine what sanction to impose which could see the nurse struck-off the register. Olugbile worked at the Collingwood Court Nursing Centre between March 27, 2006 and February 9, 2011 after registering as a nurse in 2005.","Osironke Olugbile, 53, also barricaded residents in their rooms .

"Justice SecretaryKenneth Clarke pledged that an act of Parliament would be used to 'clarify' the existing legal right to use reasonable force against intruders . Householders were yesterday given licence to kill burglars with knives or pokers without fear of prosecution. Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke suggested people would be judged to have acted within the law as long as they did not shoot intruders in the back as they were running away down the road. And he pledged that an act of Parliament would be used to ‘clarify’ the existing legal right to use reasonable force against intruders. Prime Minister David Cameron last week promised that the Government would ‘put beyond doubt that homeowners and small shopkeepers who use reasonable force to defend themselves or their properties will not be prosecuted’. The move follows public outrage at cases like that of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer who shot dead a burglar, and Munir Hussain, who chased and beat a man who had held his family at knifepoint in their home. ‘If an old lady finds she has got an 18-year-old burgling her house and she picks up a kitchen knife and sticks it in him, she has not committed a criminal offence and we will make that clear,’ Mr Clarke said. ‘There is no doubt that you or I or anybody else is entitled to use reasonable force to defend ourselves and to protect ourselves or our homes or both. ‘We will make it quite clear you can hit the burglar with the poker if he is in the house and you have a perfect defence if you do so.’ Mr Clarke accepted that the defence of reasonable force already exists, but said: ‘Given that doubts are expressed, we are going to clarify that. ‘It is quite obvious that people are entitled to use whatever force is necessary to protect themselves and their homes. What they are not entitled to do is go running down the road chasing them or shooting them in the back when they are running away or to get their friends together and go and beat them up. ‘Nobody should prosecute and nobody should ever convict anybody who takes these steps.’ An official spokesman for David Cameron said that the Prime Minister was 'very pleased' with Mr Clarke's remarks, but Labour's justice spokesman Sadiq Khan, right, said the Justice Bill is in 'total shambles' It is not clear whether a clause will be added to the Government’s Justice Bill later in the year, or guidelines to police, prosecutors and courts will be strengthened. David Cameron’s official spokesman said that the Prime Minister was ‘very pleased’ with Mr Clarke’s remarks, which follow months of controversy over ‘soft justice’. But Labour’s justice spokesman Sadiq Khan accused the Government of using ‘spin and smokescreens of new laws in an attempt to distract from what is a Justice Bill in total shambles’.","Homeowners will be able to STAB burglars without fear of prosecution, says Mr Clarke .

"The multi-billion pound industry built on vexatious discrimination claims against employers has virtually collapsed, it emerged yesterday. Employment tribunal cases have dropped by three-quarters over the past year, with sex discrimination claims down by 80 per cent and race claims by 60 per cent. The spectacular decline follows a simple reform introduced by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last summer – the charging of fees to workers who want to make a claim against their employer. Scroll down for video . New idea: The spectacular decline follows a simple reform introduced by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (pictured) last summer - the charging of fees to workers who want to make a claim against their employer . The charge, which is £1,200 for discrimination claims, is reimbursed to employees who win. But the threat of losing this money appears to have deterred the majority of those who would once have been tempted to claim. In the first six months of the new fees system, the number of claims to employment tribunals dropped from 109,425 to 20,678. This fall of nearly 90,000 is a major boost for businesses, which were previously spending around £1.6billion a year in defence costs. There were 191,000 employment claims in the financial year to March 2013. Around one in five businesses were thought to have been threatened, with the average defence costing £8,500 and compensation to employees who won averaging £10,000 each. The scale of the collapse was highlighted by the TUC in a report on the impact of the new fees. Trade union leaders argued the reform has meant ‘a huge victory for Britain’s worst bosses’. TUC chief Frances O’Grady said: ‘By charging up-front fees for harassment and abuse claims the Government has made it easier for bad employers to get away with the most appalling behaviour.’ But there was satisfaction among ministers and business leaders, who believe the system was regularly abused by vexatious claimants, including serial litigants trying to win thousands of pounds for spurious complaints. Viewpoint: Trade union leaders including TUC chief Frances O'Grady (pictured) argued the reform has meant 'a huge victory for Britain¿s worst bosses' The consequences of vexatious claims . are most serious for small businesses, which can rarely afford to launch . a robust defence. Prior to the new system, claims had more than doubled . since the year 2000, when there were around 80,000 a year. The . fees, introduced at the end of July last year, range from £390 for a . straightforward claim over unfair dismissal or a failure to pay wages, . to £1,200 for sex or race discrimination. But poor claimants can have . the fees reduced, or even waived. 'Employment tribunals should always be the last resort in an employment dispute as they can be stressful, time consuming and expensive for all parties' John Allan, Federation of Small Businesses . If the claimant wins, the tribunal normally orders the employer to reimburse the fees. The TUC report, based on Ministry of Justice figures, said sex discrimination claims went from 6,017 in the three months to March 2013 to just 1,222 in the same three months this year. The figures also showed there were 584 claims of race discrimination in July 2013. By January this year the number had fallen to 157. Equal pay claims also saw a large decline, from 3,654 in March 2013 to 574 in March this year. John Allan of the Federation of Small Businesses welcomed the changes, saying: ‘Employment tribunals should always be the last resort in an employment dispute as they can be stressful, time consuming and expensive for all parties.’ Justice Minister Shailesh Vara said: ‘It is reasonable to expect people to pay towards the £74million bill taxpayers face for providing the service.’ Defeated: Apprentice winner Stella English . Business tycoon Lord Sugar furiously denounced a ‘vexatious’ claim brought against him at an employment tribunal by a winner of his reality . TV show, The Apprentice. Stella English, 35, claimed that after she won a . £100,000-a-year role with one of Lord Sugar’s companies she was given a non-job . from which she felt forced to resign. She lost her constructive dismissal case last April, when . the tribunal ruled her allegations of unfair treatment ‘should never have been . brought’. Lord Sugar said: ‘This case was a sham and a total abuse of . a tribunal system which is there to protect employees ... it is not there to . aid those chancing their arm at landing a big payday.’ Department store John Lewis was also the subject of a . tribunal claim after a staff member said he had been sexually harassed. Furniture sales assistant Konstantinos Kalomoiris, 40, . complained that his ‘tactile’ colleague Bianca Revrenna routinely slapped his . and other co-workers’ bottoms.

"A pro-life pregnancy center in Iowa is now offering a little-tested and unproven 'abortion reversal' treatment free-of-charge for women who regret starting the process of medically terminating a pregnancy. Doctors at the Women's Choice Center in Bettendorf say they introduced the controversial option in response to the prevalence of Mifepristone, or RU-486, better known as the 'abortion pill'. The pill is an alternative to a surgical abortion, which blocks progesterone and causes the uterine lining to break down, effectively stopping the pregnancy, according to Vocativ. While the morning-after pill - also known as Plan B or emergency contraception - helps prevent pregnancy, the abortion pill - also known as a medical abortion - terminates pregnancy. Scroll down for video . Untested: Abortion reversal is a controversial new procedure developed by a Catholic, Pro-Life doctor and offered at the Women's Choice Center in Bettendorf, Iowa . After taking Mifepristone, the patient takes a second pill, Misoprostol, between 24 and 48 hours later, which causes the uterus to empty. The 'abortion reversal' is meant to come in during this step. The Women's Choice Center administer progesterone treatments to patients that have taken Mifepristone but have not yet taken the second pill. The treatments are meant to override the effects of the steroid, allowing the pregnancy to continue. However other doctors have slammed the treatment, saying it is 'very incomplete' and 'misleading'. The executive director of the Women's Choice Center, Vicki Tyler, believes some women will take Mifepristone and regret their decision. 'Because of our close proximity to Planned Parenthood, we knew that there would be a woman who would take that first pill and want to reverse the procedure.' The center's medical director, Dr. Karla Polaschek, OB-GYN, learned of the treatment through Human Life International, a non-medical, Catholic, pro-life organization, and elected to begin providing it a few weeks ago, according to Vocativ. Common: Taking Mifepristone, or RU-486, better known as the 'abortion pill', is what is known as a medical abortion, and is an alternative a surgical abortion . 'Because of our close proximity to Planned Parenthood (located directly across the street), we knew that there would be a woman who would take that first pill and want to reverse the procedure,' Tyler said. 'And shortly after we began providing the treatment, we received our first phone call, so we know the demand is there.' No other clinic has advertised the service. The Women's Choice Center does not charge patients for the progesterone treatments. It is also yet to have a patient undergo the treatments. Tyler says 230 other pro-life OB-GYNs are looking at offering the service. However it has not been properly tested or proven completely effective. Only one study has been done on the treatment and it was co-authored by the physician who developed it, Dr. George Delgado. In the study, four of the six women who underwent progesterone treatments after taking Mifepristone had regular vaginal births. But, crucially, the outcomes of the other two women were not listed. The website of Dr. George Delgado's promotes progesterone therapy as an effective way to reverse a medical abortion, however it has not been properly tested and is only offered at one clinic in Iowa . 'It's a very incomplete report,' Dr. Daniel Grossman, an OB-GYN and member of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told Vocativ. 'It's not a clinical trial. We have no evidence that this is an effective regimen, and I would say that it is outside the standard of care to use a treatment that has not been examined in clinical trials.' The side effects of undergoing progesterone treatments are relatively minor, and include hair loss, insomnia, breast tenderness and nausea. However Dr. Grossman said the headlining problem with clinics offering the service is that they are misleading partients into thinking they can reverse a medical abortion. He also said it's 'exceedingly rare' for a woman to change her mind after undergoing the necessary abortion counseling before taking the drug. 'This seems more like a media campaign than an attempt to provide a service that is actually needed,' Dr Grossman said. 'And that's on top of the fact that this treatment hasn't even been proven effective.' On Saturday The MailOnline was contacted by Mary L Davenport, MD, FACOG, who said she was a co-author of the study of the progesterone treatments. Dr. Davenport said that two of the six women in the study suffered miscarriages. She said that they have further tested 106 women, and that  56 - just over half - 'have given birth to normal babies'. However the results of that study have not been published, and do not appear on the Abortion Pill Reversal website.","Women's Choice Center in Bettendorf, Iowa, first clinic to introduce the option free-of-charge .

"The RSPCA has turned from a 'great institution' into a 'sinister and nasty' organisation which is not interested in animal welfare, the head of the Countryside Alliance has warned. General Sir Barney White-Spunner has urged his members to stop donating to the charity because they are becoming more interested in animal rights issues such as fox hunting and badger culls. The former Army comanding officer, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, also questioned where the charity's 'authority' came from and believes the animal inspectors have been given intrusive powers which have no basis in law. Controversial: The RSPCA were criticised earlier this year for private prosecutions they brought against hunts in the UK (file picture) Sir Barney raised money for the RSPCA as a youngster but now wants a new organisation to replace the 189-year-old charity, he told the The Daily Telegraph. They have received heavy criticism from rural campaigners after their campaigning during the fox hunting ban and the badger cull was investigated by the Charity Commission. Last year, the RSPCA was condemned during its pursuit . of fox hunters, after it spent £326,000 on a private prosecution against . Oxfordshire’s Heythrop Hunt. Change: Sir Barney White-Spunner hopes a new charity will replace the RSPCA in fighting for animal welfare . The judge in the case questioned whether members' money could have been better spent. More . recently, the charity has infuriated dairy farmers by trying to stop the . badger cull, intended to halt the spread of bovine tuberculosis. Sir Barney claims farmers were targeted and 'intimated' by campaigners during the bid and is concerned ministers may now drop the policy. His cattle herd was shut down because of an outbreak of TB, and he claims to have only just cleared the financial costs. 'It’s a sad story. A once great British institution has been turned from an animal welfare organisation to one concerned with animal rights. 'They have no statutory responsibility, . yet when their inspectors turn up in uniform it’s as a private . organisation. There is something rather sinister and nasty about it.' In the interview he also claimed that the National Trust was responsible for turning the countryside into 'some sort of theme park' and said the BBC was guilty of portraying rural people as 'Neanderthal'. Sir Barney also attacked the limited mobile reception in rural areas of Britain saying there is more signal in Helmand Province than in Dorset. He said the BBC’s coverage of the countryside was neither fair nor balanced and said Countryfile had failed to cover issues such as shooting. In terms of mobile phone coverage, he claims there is an ongoing 'digital apartheid' between urban and rural areas. Other nations manage to cover 98 per cent of their population, whereas in the United Kingdom it is around bout 80 per cent. A spokesman for the RSPCA said: 'Sir Barney White-Spunner's interview shows once again how far out of touch he and his colleagues at the pro bloodsports Countryside Alliance are with the reality of public opinion in this country. 'He is clearly unhappy that the RSPCA continues to be proud to represent the views of the majority of British people who do not want to see the return of fox hunting and to speak for animals who have no choice and no voice. 'This has been reinforced once again this week by a new opinion polling showing that more than 80% of both rural and urban dwellers oppose any repeal of the hunting act. Anger: Sir Barney also condemned the charity's attempt to stop the badger cull in Somerset and Gloucestershire . 'Sir White-Spunner criticises the RSPCA for bringing a prosecution against a hunt, but fails to mention that the hunt pleaded guilty and the judge in the case was himself criticised for making unhelpful and inappropriate comments. 'He also criticises the RSPCA's inspectors, who work every day of the year to ensure animals are protected from cruelty. Indeed most of their visits involve giving support and advice to pet owners to help them improve care for their animals. But in some cases the only option is the legal route. 'The RSPCA has over a million supporters - a number that is growing, contrary to Sir Barney's assertion. 'The RSPCA does not apologise for doing what the charity was formed to do more than 100 years ago - stopping animal abuse and without fear or favour, bringing those who harm animals to justice.","Sir Barney White-Spunner urged members to stop giving to animal charity .

Figure-hugging: Kimberley Walsh and Kym Lomax are big fans of Body Frocks, which are designed to enhance women's shape . Holly Willoughby, Kym Lomax and Kimberley Walsh have all benefited from the control lining in the dresses - the secret to the dresses' success - which the brand says fits 'slim and taut like a corset', making the garment instantly slimming and smoothing. Mooi is another contender in the market. In April this year, they unveiled the S dress (the letter stands for . 'shape'), claiming the garment, made from machine-washable, crease-resistant material, would help its . wearer drop a dress size. Slimming: According to the brand, the Body Frock dresses, which start at £155, should fit slim and taut like a corset . Slimming style: Gok Wan has also created a range of slimming dresses, on sale for £35 at TU for Sainsbury's . Each . of the £360 garments is made with 28 per cent elastane, which, Mooi say, creates a . slimming effect that makes the wearer appear an entire size smaller. Gok Wan, renowned for making women feel great about themselves and their bodies, was one of the first to harness slimming technology for the High Street for his collection for Tu at Sainsbury. Inspired by Roland Mouret, whose fitted dresses hid inner corsets, he brought the technology to the masses with a range of colourful wrap dresses that would pull in tummies, smooth down lumps and VPLs and shape up bottoms and waists. His latest collection features two £35 styles, both with tummy support slip which claim to 'pull you in and smooth any bumps.'

"Jack Daniel's is to spend more than $100 million expanding its rural Tennessee distillery so it can keep up with demand in the growing whiskey market. The investment is the largest single production expansion in . the brand's long history. It will add stills and barrel warehouses at . the Jack Daniel's operations in Lynchburg, the brand's . parent company, Brown-Forman Corp, announced. A second production building will go up on the same grounds as the . current distillery site, which traces its roots back to just after the . Civil War ended. Glass half full: The Jack Daniel's distillery is having a $100 million expansion to keep up with demand . Company officials said the distillery was bumping up against capacity pressures that will be relieved by the . second production facility, but they did not say how many new warehouses will be built for the whiskey to age in. 'It's a good time in the whiskey industry, and our future prospects . look really good,' Jeff Arnett, the brand's master distiller, said. 'We don't want to find ourselves without any additional throttle, if we . need it. This will basically secure that we've got the ability to give . Jack Daniel's to all of those who want Jack Daniel's for years to come.' The new production facility, which will take two years to complete, will have access to the same source of cave spring water as the existing distillery, he said. 'It's going to ensure that every drop of Jack Daniel's is made here . in Lynchburg, Tennessee, from the same water source,' Mr Arnett said. Sales have soared for the brand in the past decade, as Jack Daniel's has spread to more countries. The brand has had volume growth for . 21 straight years, and its global net sales increased by 9 per cent in . the past year. Since 2004, global case sales have risen from about 7.7 . million cases to nearly 11 million cases last year. The brand is sold in more than 160 countries, but the U.S. still ranks as . its largest market, with domestic sales also growing in 2012. Overseas markets represent slightly more than half of overall . sales. Its largest international markets include the UK, . Germany and Australia, where the brand's premixed cocktails are popular. Emerging markets such as Russia, China, Turkey and Brazil have become . key contributors to global sales. Roots: The new plant will be built on the historic Lynchburg site where Jack Daniel's has been made for nearly 150 years . Cheers: Master distiller Jeff Arnett says the plans mean they will be able to keep up with demand . In neighboring Kentucky, the bourbon industry is in the midst of its largest expansion since Prohibition to meet growing demand. In the past two years, Kentucky's bourbon makers have invested nearly . $300 million in new and expanded production facilities, warehouses and . visitors' centers. Kentucky produces 95 per cent . of the world's bourbon, and the 4.9 million barrels of aging bourbon in . Kentucky outnumber the state's 4.3 million people. Jack Daniel's is the flagship brand for Brown-Forman, whose other . brands include Southern Comfort, Finlandia, Korbel and el Jimador. The expansion will give Jack Daniel's . more room to roll out new products, part of a key industry-wide trend as . spirits makers introduce new flavors. The 147-year-old distillery and its employees, along with Lynchburg, . have been the focus of Jack Daniel's folksy advertising for years. Black-and-white labeled bottles of the charcoal mellowed 'sippin' whiskey' list Lynchburg's population as 361, but the town and county really has about 6,400 residents.

"Manchester City have never made an approach for Ross Barkley, according to Everton manager Roberto Martinez. The England youngster was linked with a £60million move to the Premier League champions last summer with the Manchester Evening News even claiming the 20-year-old was 'the player City covet more than any other'. However, Martinez - speaking ahead of his side's visit to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday - insisted that City have never made direct contact over the player he claims will become 'the best player England has ever had.' Ross Barkley is not a big money target for Manchester City, according to Everton boss Roberto Martinez . Martinez (left) believes Barkley is gradually returning to his best after a spell out injured . 'We have a great relationship with City. We signed Gareth Barry on loan from them and the relationship has always been good but there has never been an approach about Ross,' he said. 'Never. Honestly, City are not trying to do that. Maybe if you are a selling club they could try that, but we are not a selling club. 'I think every game we play there is a link with one of our players. When we went to Wolfsburg it was Romelu Lukaku and when you go to another ground it is Kevin Mirallas. 'Ross doesn't care. He could play in the most intense game of football with the most intense atmosphere and the biggest meaning and all he sees is an enjoyment. That is the big attribute he has.' Barkley, who turns 21 next week, has been sidelined by injury at the start of this campaign but Martinez says he is gradually returning to his best form. The 20-year-old has impressed despite Everton's recent run of poor results, including a 2-1 loss to Spurs . Everton have a good relationship with City after bringing in Gareth Barry (left) from the Etihad . 'I think he has improved massively. It is unfair to look at Ross's performances and blame our results on that,' he said, after seeing his side beaten 2-1 by Tottenham and then held to a 1-1 draw by Hull in the last week. 'Can he improve? Of course he can because he is a young man who has all the potential in the world. I see massive improvement in certain areas from where he was last season and I think we are going to see the best Ross Barkley in the second half of the season. 'Preseason, before the injury, Ross was at his very best.

"Respected: Dr David Drew had a 37-year-long unblemished career in the NHS . A Christian doctor who was sacked because he emailed a prayer to his colleagues has claimed hospital managers targeted him as an NHS whistleblower after he lost an appeal against his dismissal. Consultant paediatrician Dr David Drew, 65, sent a 16th-century prayer by St Ignatius Loyola around his department in April 2009, hoping it would be motivational. Dr Drew, who had an unblemished 37-year career in the NHS, was told to ‘keep his religious beliefs to himself’ by a review panel, which was called to investigate his conduct in March 2010. After refusing to accept their findings, he was sacked from Walsall Manor Hospital, where he worked as a clinical director. Today the father-of-four, who lives in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, with his wife Janet, 63, said the email had been used as a smokescreen to push him out of his post. He said: 'My case was never about the religion, . it was about the fact the hospital wouldn’t listen to its most senior . paediatrician telling them they were cutting costs to the bone and . putting patient safety at risk. 'It’s . all about whistleblowing. We’ve now got people like Robert Francis [Robert Francis QC, who chaired the public inquiry into the Stafford hospital deaths] . telling us doctors and nurses are too scared to raise concerns because . it’s considered a career-ending move. 'There . were five gags put on my case so we’ve never been able to interrogate . the process used in the review which led to my dismissal. Whistleblower: Dr Drew believes managers took offence when he pointed out his safety concerns at Walsall Manor Hospital, pictured . 'My case is the exact opposite of the transparency that’s being called for in the NHS today. 'We have to give doctors and nurses freedom to safely report when they see things going wrong and putting patients at risk. It’s a scandal.' The doctor was branded as having committed ‘gross misconduct and insubordination’ in December 2010. An . employment tribunal in April last year rejected his claims of unfair . dismissal, religious discrimination and victimisation against Walsall . Hospitals NHS Trust. Teach us, good Lord . To serve as You deserve, . To give and not to count the cost, . To fight and not to heed the wounds, . To toil and not to seek for rest, . To labour and not to ask for any reward, . Save that of knowing we do Your will. And on . Monday this week a judge upheld the decision of the lower court after . he deemed its findings were based on available evidence. Judge . Jeffrey Burke QC said the original panel had not made any error in law . and rejected claims from Dr Drew’s legal team that their conclusions . were ‘perverse’. Dr Drew prefaced the prayer that he sent around the department, called ‘To give . and not to count the cost’, with the words: 'I find this a personal . inspiration in my frail imperfect efforts to serve my patients, their . families and our department.' Managers declared he had created a ‘toxic work environment’ with what were inappropriate religious communications. Dr Drew said today: 'It was the management that raised a . complaint against me after they found an email I’d sent to my colleagues . with this traditional, literary prayer in it. 'They gave me instructions I was to keep my religion out of the workplace. 'We were a very very happy department with people of different faiths and even some atheists who were quite outspoken. 'But . we were senior, intelligent, well-educated people who were not extreme . in our beliefs in any way. We co-existed quite happily.' Motivational: Dr Drew said he sent St Ignatius Loyola's prayer to colleagues to offer them inspiration . Dr Drew was suspended in the same month after a senior nurse claimed he had undermined her, but the allegation was later proved unfounded. Dr Drew was meeting with his legal team yesterday to discuss the case. He plans to release a book about his case in November. A spokesperson from Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust said that the issues that Dr Drew raised today had been addressed through several stringent formal processes on-going since 2009. The spokesperson said the Trust was satisfied with the outcome of the case and that Dr Drew's claims had been dismissed, but added: 'We would like to reiterate that this case did not question Dr Drew’s skills as a Paediatric Consultant and on behalf of the Trust would like to say that we regret that the situation had to get to the Tribunal stage. 'As a Trust we actively encourage and support our staff to raise an issue if they are concerned about patient care.'","Dr David Drew dismissed from Walsall Manor Hospital in 2010 .

"Jose Mourinho criticised Newcastle's ball boys and accused them of wasting time after Chelsea's 2-1 defeat at St James' Park on Saturday. Mourinho, who is yet to taste a league victory at Newcastle in his two stints as Chelsea boss, felt his side were unfortunate to lose and suggested the Magpies employed time-wasting tactics to get over the line.

VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho remonstrates with fourth official Robert Madley .

In the second half again we had chances, we didn't (score). 'They defend and the first time they were there (in attack) they score a goal. After that, everybody (got) behind (the ball) against a team that tried everything and a team (in which) every player went to the last seconds. 'We wanted to play more football but it was not possible because a few things I thought didn't belong any more to top-level football but still belongs - the ball disappeared, the ball doesn't come, another ball comes, the ball boys run away - these kind of situations that unfortunately are still part of the game.

"Alan Clune, a convicted rapist with HIV, went on the run but has been spared jail . A convicted rapist with HIV who sparked a nationwide manhunt after going on the run has been spared jail - because of his ill health. As a registered sex offender drifter Alan Clune, 32, was required to tell police where he lived after he was released from jail. He went on the run after moving out of a house in Lancashire he shared with his partner without telling police. Senior officers said he posed a risk . to members of the public and he was at large for 10 days before being . found 300 miles from home in London. It . emerged Clune, a former Big Issue seller, had repeatedly ignored a sex . offender order demanding he tell police of his home address. He . had originally been jailed for four years for the rape an 18-year old . heterosexual man whilst knowing he was HIV positive and had Hepatitis B. At . Burnley Crown Court, Clune admitted breaching the notification . requirements of the sex offenders' register but was given a two year . suspended prison term after his lawyer told how his client was . undergoing dialysis and had skin cancer. Passing . sentence Judge Beverley Lunt said she was imposing a suspended sentence . only because of Clune's health, but warned if he failed to comply with . the order again, he would be locked up for a total of four years. Judge . Lunt warned him: 'It's an absolute certainty. Start obeying the rules. The trouble with you is if you go off the rails, you go off . spectacularly.' Clune who became a drug addict at 13 learned he contracted HIV in July 2002. The following September he raped his 18 year old victim following a drinking session in Swansea. The teenager who had been visiting the Welsh city to see his girlfriend had to endure 'three months of terror' before doctors could tell him he had not contracted the disease. In December 2002 Clune was ordered to sign on the Sex Offender register for life but after his release from jail flouted the order three times in the space of two years. Sentencing at Burnley Crown Court, pictured, Judge Beverley Lunt told Ashworth: 'You identified this entirely innocent man and he's now seeking help with mental issues, suffers panic attacks' He was given a suspended jail term in December 2006 then in November 2007 was jailed for five months before being given a further three months in July 2008 for breaching the terms of the order. He disappeared again on May 11 last year after quitting his home in Haslingden, near Rossendale. The alarm was raised when police had gone to Clune's home in relation to a completely unrelated matter and found that he was no longer living there. Michael Scholes, prosecuting, said Clune registered at a Salvation Army drop-in centre in the West End of London on May 16, saying he was homeless and had been sleeping rough. On May 21, police turned up to arrest Clune but he slipped out of the door and ran off. He was detained in a nearby Apple store. Lawyers for Clune later said his actions were 'not a precursor' to any sexual offence. He said he would 'sofa surf' from time to time when he got into difficulties. In mitigation defence lawyer Bob Sastry said his client's disappearance was 'not necessarily premeditated.' He had been having difficulties with his then-partner and the relationship had broken down. The barrister continued : 'He must acknowledge, particularly when he was staying at the Salvation Army, there was no difficulty in telling police where he was. By that stage, he was worried about going to prison.'","Alan Clune, 32, served four years for raping 18-year-old heterosexual man .

'It was a great experience for me and I'm just happy to get the victory. Everyone backed me and showed me great support, the gaffer, the backroom staff, everyone,' said the relaxed debutant.

"A Singaporean 'toy nerd' has spent the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of pounds and even lost girlfriends to a highly unusual hobby: collecting dolls. Jian Yang has decorated the living room of his otherwise rather spartan townhouse a vivid pink  (Barbie's signature colour Pantone 219 C, naturally) in order to do justice to his collection of dolls, including 6,000 Barbies. In a floor-to-ceiling glass case in . the living room, Osama bin Laden shares a drink with Saddam Hussein as . Maleficent, the evil sorceress from 'Sleeping Beauty', Jackie Onassis . and Lady Diana look on. Elsewhere are Elvis Presley, Sean Connery as . James Bond and characters from 'Harry Potter' and 'Star Trek.' Jian Yang poses with part of his collection, which has taken him 20 years to amass, at his home in Singapore . Jian's passion runs the gamut of eras and styles; here he shows off a Osama bin Laden doll . The 6000 Barbies are just a portion of his doll collection, which is steadily taking over his townhouse . Yang now has a professional interest in toys and consumer trends as director of strategy at Omicom Media Group . The . 33-year-old allows his prized Barbies and 3,000 dolls of other kinds to . dominate three sides of the main room and spill over to fill nine . mirrored cabinets in his dressing room and the shelves of his study. He said: 'Incongruous is kind of me. When you meet me outside of this, I'm not that kind of guy. I'm not what you expect from a guy that collects dolls.' Although Yang now has a professional interest in toys and consumer trends in his job as Director of Strategy at Omicom Media Group, his Barbie collection began at age 13 when he bought the 'Great Shape' model in a turquoise Spandex gym outfit and striped leg warmers. 'Before I knew anything about social norms, I was a boy that watched this on TV, liked it and wasn't allowed to have one,' he said. 'As I grew older, got my own allowance, that's where I started getting the freedom to buy whatever I wanted.' His boyhood interest turned into a 'crazy obsession' that his friends support and his family has come to accept. Yang buys dolls when he travels for work and purchased 65 dolls during his last trip to New York . Rare Barbie dolls in the likeness of Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe (L-R) are displayed . Yang talks about the very first doll  he brought; the 'Great Shape' model in a turquoise Spandex gym outfit and striped leg warmers . Jian Yang slings an accessory over the first doll that started off his collection . 'I'm very into collections, I'm very into amassing,' Yang said. 'I've also got the ex-girlfriends who get insecure about this kind of stuff ... They look at dolls and go 'OK, that's the competition', which is quite troubling but it's a reality.' The self-described 'toy nerd' reckons he has spent at least S$500,000 (£251,669) over the last 20 years on his collection, which also features hundreds and hundreds of dolls from the Bratz Girls, Monster High and Jem and the Holograms lines. Barbie, launched in 1959 by Mattel Inc wearing a zebra-pattern swimsuit, has sold more than 1 billion dolls . Sales of the dolls and related products did fall 12 percent in the April to June period of this year - the fourth straight quarter of decline - as tastes shift away from the traditional toy, but Yang maintains that Barbie is an icon that still has a future, although he admits 'the relevance is waning' as princesses and ballerinas give way to the ghoulish imagery and stories popularised by vampire movies such as 'Twilight' and 'New Moon'. A Farah Fawcett doll sits among other dolls: Yang says despite the size of his collection he has no plans to stop . 'That's where Mattel has taken it,' he said. 'They have taken the craze of ugly is hot and made Monster High because they know Barbie will never be the monster.' Hasbro Inc, Mattel's main competitor and a client of Yang's in his work, has made similar changes to its dolls. Yang's oldest Barbies date from the early 1960s, including one in a nurse's outfit with cat's eye glasses. But his passion runs the gamut of eras and styles, including Barbies in dozens of national costumes and editions with the likenesses of Grace Kelly, Barbra Streisand, Carol Burnett and Elizabeth Taylor. The rarest Barbie he owns is a model sold only in boutiques of the Comme des Garcons fashion label. 'My friend found her in Hong Kong and made an emergency phone call to me,' he said.

"Alan Pardew was ecstatic after seeing his Newcastle team end Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season with a 2-1 win  on Saturday - but was bemused after fourth official Robert Madley added six minutes of injury time. Jose Mourinho's men halved Newcastle's advantage through a Didier Drogba strike on 83 minutes but as the clock reached 90, St James' Park was left  roaring in fury as another six minutes were added on. And it reminded Toon boss Pardew of visiting Old Trafford under Sir Alex Ferguson's tenure. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats .

Pardew said the decision to add six minutes of time on at the end of the game was like 'Fergie time' 'Talk about Fergie time, that was certainly Mourinho time,' Pardew joked. 'I was very disappointed with the six minutes because as the home team I’ve never had that.' But Pardew made time to credit referee Martin Atkinson for allowing Newcastle to play on after a foul on Ayoze Perez, as the move ended in Papiss Cisse's second goal of the game. 'I have to pay tribute to him as well because the foul on Ayoze, he plays on and we get the second goal. You have got to take everything into account,' Pardew said. Despite Chelsea's first defeat of the season handing second-placed Manchester City the opportunity to narrow the gap between the two sides to three points when they take on Everton later on Saturday, Pardew still believes Chelsea will win the Premier League.

"Claude Dielna came off the bench in injury time to score the winner as Sheffield Wednesday recorded a 2-1  Championship win at Blackburn but the game was marred by a sickening head injury suffered by Lewis McGugan. McGugan went down and was motionless after colliding with Lee Williamson before being stretchered off in a neck brace for Stuart Gray's side.

Seven minutes of time were added on at the end of the first half due to the delay. 'He was knocked out completely,' Gray said. 'At the moment he's a bit fragile but the medical side will look after that. 'He's obviously come round but he was totally out of it for two or three minutes on the pitch. I think it was precautionary putting the (neck) brace on him.' Wednesday went ahead early on through Kieran Lee's close range effort, which was soon cancelled out by Alex Baptiste. Wednesday were resolute throughout and Stevie May forced a low save from Jason Steele but the best chances fell to the hosts, with Jordan Rhodes heading onto the post and Ryan Tunnicliffe forcing a flying save from Keiren Westwood. But just as it looked like the spoils would be shared, Dielna popped up to give Wednesday a first Ewood Park success since 1999, ending Rovers' nine-match unbeaten run. Gary Bowyer recalled Steele in goal after he was ineligible against his parent club Middlesbrough last week. But Gray's side were ahead in the third minute. May sprung the offside trap and although his shot was weak, Steele made a mess of gathering it and Lee was on hand to tap home. Wednesday were quickest to everything but in Blackburn's first decent spell of possession, they equalised when Rhodes nodded down into the path of  Baptiste and he wrapped his foot over the ball to fire past Westwood from 10 yards. It settled Rovers, who looked in control - but they almost conceded again when Shane Duffy missed a routine clearance and May reacted to force a sharp low save from Steele.

'When Richard Wigglesworth arrived, I was dispatched back to my club - and yes I was disappointed. 'But I also remember talking to Stuart when he announced his plans for scrum-half, laughing out loud. 'When he asked me what I found amusing, I suggested that if we beat Samoa, as we did, he'd find it difficult to change the team again and would not bring me back.

"The family of Akai Gurley - the unarmed black man shot dead by a rookie police officer in a darkened New York public housing stairwell - have warned Rev Al Sharpton to stop meddling in their affairs as they prepare to bury their son and father this weekend. Gurley’s aunt, Hertencia Petersen - speaking on behalf of the man's mother, Sylvia Palmer - said the outspoken civil rights activist has been nothing but opportunistic over Gurley's death, seeing it as a political play when his family just want to lay him to rest. Sharpton reportedly implanted himself into the planned memorial and funeral service this weekend without properly speaking with Gurley's parents. 'It’s been a nightmare,' Mrs Petersen told The New York Post. 'He just wants to take credit for this when he’s never even contacted my sister (Gurley’s mother). 'Who made you the spokesperson of our family? We just want to bury our nephew with dignity and respect.' Meddling: The mother of shooting victim Akai Gurley, Sylvia Palmer (left) has said through family that Rev. Al Sharpton has been a 'nightmare' by trying to implant himself into Gurley's funeral this weekend .

Family pains: The stepfather and mother (center) of Akai Gurley attend his wake at Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Brooklyn, New York on Friday . Mrs Petersen further told TMZ: '(All Shapton sees) is money and political gain and that he is turning the tragedy into a circus.' Sharpton claims he was asked to speak at Gurley's memorial in Brooklyn on Friday night by Kimberly Ballinger, the shooting victim’s domestic partner and mother of his two-year-old daughter. However he pulled out of the service, citing 'confusion'. Sharpton then told TMZ he questions the motives of Mrs Petersen. 'I do not know that this Aunt has legal standing to speak for the family,' he told the website. 'When Kimberly asked us for help we responded because she had legal standing as his domestic partner and the mother of his child ... who is the next of kin.' Sharpton was set to read a euology, which his family disagreed with because he had never met Gurley. The memorial otherwise went ahead as planned on Friday, just hours after the Brooklyn district attorney announced plans to take Gurley's case to a grand jury. Shot dead by police: Akai Gurley, 28, died from a single bullet to the torso inside the stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project on November 20. He is pictured here with his daughter, Akaila . Gurley has become part of a narrative of anguish over police use of deadly force, with his wake coming amid protests over the lack of criminal charges against white police officers in the recent deaths of unarmed black men in New York City and Ferguson, Missouri. 'We know because of the circumstances that brought about Akai's death, the entire world family is watching,' the city's elected public advocate, Letitia James, told the gathering. State Assemblyman Walter Mosley told the hundreds of mourners that 'regardless of what's going on in the world, in the nation, we need to say, `Peace be still.' The day of atonement and judgment will come another day.' A stream of mourners lined a Brooklyn street as Gurley's casket was brought into a church. 'He was an American!' mourner Selina Forfort exclaimed. Officer Peter Liang was patrolling a pitch-dark stairwell by flashlight, his gun drawn, when the 28-year-old Gurley and his girlfriend opened a door into the stairway Nov. 20, police said. Liang fired without a word and apparently by accident, police said. Police Commissioner William Bratton has said Gurley was 'totally innocent.' Sadness: Members of Akai Gurley's family embrace in the pews during his wake at Brown Memorial Baptist Church in New York on Friday .

Praying: Mourners pray for Akai Gurley's family following his untimely death last month in a  stairwell . The wake came two days after a grand jury on Staten Island decided criminal charges weren't warranted against a different police officer in the chokehold death of another unarmed man, Eric Garner. Last week, a Missouri grand jury decided not to indict a police officer in the fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown. The cases have sparked debate around the country about the grand jury process. Brooklyn DA Kenneth Thompson said Friday he would convene a grand jury 'because it is important to get to the bottom of what happened,' pledging 'a full and fair investigation.' He was 'always a faithful, faithful person,' his stepfather, Kenneth Palmer, told mourners Friday. 'When you hear laughter, that's Akai,' he said. 'When you see a smile, that's Akai ... Let us not forget.' Before the service: The casket of Akai Gurley, an unarmed man fatally shot by police in East New York, is taken inside the Brown Memorial Baptist Church for his funeral .

"Allan McGregor saved an early penalty to help earn Hull a point in what must rate as one of the lowest quality games of this Premier League season so far - but Hull have nonetheless fallen into the relegation zone despite getting something from the game. Their failure to win, combined with QPR beating Burnley, means they drop a place and into the bottom three. West Brom, who were if anything even less threatening than Hull, remain very much in trouble. It wouldn’t be harsh on either to club to say they’ve been poor this season and are both in serious danger of a season-long relegation scrap. So the prospect of brilliant entertainment was always remote between teams low on confidence and in fear of getting dragged into the drop zone.

You take a point and move on.’ He singled out McGregor for praise. The Scottish goalkeeper saved an early penalty from Graham Dorrans, albeit a poorly taken one, and later thwarted Craig Gardner with a brilliant leap. ‘The save from Gardner was arguably the save of the season,’ Bruce said. He added that the expectation on Hull to stay up is ‘unbelievable’, but repeated that they are still new to this division. ‘I still think we’ve got enough [quality] in the squad to see us through,’ he said.

Hull started the day in the more lowly position in the table, in 17th place with 12 points but West Brom were only one place and one point higher. Hull came into this with just one win in their league 13 league games - and only six in the entire calendar year. West Brom kicked off on the back of four straight defeats and one win in eight. The Baggies last defeat was at home to West Ham in midweek and Alan Irvine made four changes to his starting XI to face Hull. Craig Dawson, Chris Baird and Saido Berahino were all benched while Chris Brunt is out injured. In came Gareth McAuley, Sebastien Pocognoli, Youssouf Mulumbu and James Morrison. Hull ended a four-game losing run of their own in midweek by squeaking a draw at Everton and Steve Bruce made two changes from that draw. Mohamed Diame and Nikica Jelavic were out injurted and benched respectively, replaced by Abel Hernandez - back after paternity leave, of sorts - and Sone Aluko. The first half of this match was so poor and light on chances that there was plenty of time to discuss the ins and outs of Uruguayan paternity leave with the locals. Bruce had pronounced himself surprised when Hernandez needed to go back to South America but apparently local laws there meant his partner needed the baby’s father with her in order to bring their new child out of the country. In other local gossip, on an afternoon when it was necessary to find something interesting to supplement the football, Hull are being investigated by Uefa for alleged breaches of Financial Fair Play rules. They’re under the microscope because of losses last least and because they played in Europe this season. What a long, long time ago that seems now. Hull City's Ahmed Elmohamady (right) holds off West Brom's Stephane Sessegnon as both sides chase the opening goal . Hull's Liam Rosenior (centre) has eyes for the ball as West Brom's Andre Wisdom (right) controls possession . It’s not quite accurate to say nothing whatsoever of any interest happened in the first half but suffice to say that the only shot on target was a penalty - and it was saved. West Brom thought they should have had a spot kick in the third minute when Victor Anichebe was tugged by Michael Dawson but referee Michael Oliver gave nothing, either because he didn’t see it, or thought it was a marginal offence outside the box. Oliver did award a penalty a few minutes later, and rightly so, when Anichebe was felled by Jake Livermore, who wrestled him to the ground. Graham Dorrans stepped up for the visitors and hit his effort not particularly hard, leaving Allan McGregor with a much easier job of a save than should have been the case. West Brom had a third penalty shout of the game in the opening 11 minutes when Mulumbu claimed his shot had been deliverately handled by Tom Huddlestone. But Oliver said it was a case of ball to hand and that looked to be the right call with the naked eye. To describe anything else in the first half as a ‘chance’ would be to overstate the case of the few sporadic moments of ‘threat’. Ahmed Elmohamady and Sone Aluko exchanged passes that might have led to something but that moved as cut off and the ball was cleared by Joleon Lescott. And David Meyler had a shot blocked by Gareth McAuley. Things got better in the second half - but not by much. Hernandez shot wide three minutes after the break, and then team-mate Sone Aluko did the same. Then with nearly an hour gone came the best chance since the penalty when Livermore crossed to Stephen Quinn, who placed a headed effort on target, low and right, only to see Ben Foster dive and save it. West Brom then had their best opportunity since the penalty as Craig Gardner won a free kick from a foul by Tom Huddlestone and cracked it towards goal from the left of the ‘D’. McGregor made a flying save to deny him. At the other end, Hernandez got on the end of a free kick from Robbie Brady but could only flash his header wide. Hull increasingly took the game to West Brom, finally finding some urgency. But it was took little, too late.","West Brom's Graham Dorrans misses penalty in the eighth minute .

"Jose Mourinho always said it was mission impossible and so it proved. No-one, it seems, goes unbeaten in England throughout a season these days. Arsene Wenger still has at least one up on his nemesis. Alan Pardew’s Newcastle United, the team which two months ago looked an abject parody of a Premier League side, achieved what many believed to be impossible – and they did so in some style. They survived a torrid opening thirty minutes, when Chelsea looked to be at their formidable best; they survived losing their goalkeeper at half-time and bringing on a 21-year-old debutant; and they survived playing out the closing exchanges with 10 men.

And when the fourth official Robert Madley signalled for six minutes of stoppage time at the end, there were howls of protest around an indignant St James’ Park. It was entirely understandable. A famous victory looked to be in doubt. The sense that, given enough time, Chelsea would rectify the deficit, was inescapable. And given how well Newcastle had played, that would have been hard to bear. Quite how Pardew had turned around the shambolic team that looked so dreadful when they lost at Southampton is one of the season’s mysteries. It wasn’t that they clung on to a win; they matched Chelsea and, while having periods where they had to defend, at times were the better team. The discipline, shape and determination were exemplary – Papiss Cisse will take the plaudits for is two goals after coming off the bench, but it is the engine room comprised of Jack Colback, Moussa Sissoko and – enjoying an authentic champagne moment – Cheick Tiote who provided the platform for this win. It didn’t look to be shaping up that way early on. There is something a little ominous about Chelsea when they slowly move through the gears and began to open up the throttle. The opening 30 minutes had that feel. Slowly, surely, they were overhauling Newcastle. The sheer speed of the passing, the quality of the link-ups looked to have the home side on the back foot.

There was the shot from Willian just wide on 11 minutes, which came after the slickest multi-pass build imaginable, with Chelsea simply weaving their way through their opponents. Eden Hazard dashed down the left wing on 14 minutes, causing consternation, but shot wide. John Terry then headed just over from a Cesc Fabregas corner. Willian then had a delightful curling shot just wide on 19 minutes and Fabregas was tipped away by Rob Elliot. Chelsea test every facet of your game. Be it skill or physicality, strength in the air or sheer power, they stretch you in all departments. It seemed only a matter of time before they unpicked Newcastle. And yet, Alan Pardew’s team hung on in. Sissoko and  Colback in particular refused to give the game up for lost. Bit by bit, they worked their way back into the game. They never lost their shape, each and every player pressing when required and strong in the challenge when necessary. Eventually, their endurance began to pay some dividends. On 33 minutes they produced a delightful moment when Sammy Ameobi played in a ball for the impressive Ayoze Perez. The Spaniard held the ball up and played it in for Colback who was through on goal, only for Thibaut Courtois to rush from his line to smother the ball. Newcastle’s progress might have been undone at half-time, however, with keeper Elliot, already a stand in for Tim Krul, unable to continue. On came Jak Alnwick, 21 and the brother of Ben, for a debut in the most testing circumstances imaginable. He started well, however: flattening Diego Costa as he came for his first punch. Newcastle continued to hold their own, though John Obi Mikel should have put Chelsea ahead on 56 minutes, heading wide from a Fabregas free-kick with a clear sight of goal.

Young goalkeeper Jak Alnwick came on to replace Elliott at half-time in his debut for Newcastle . But slowly the limited vulnerabilities of Chelsea begun to show – and they can be penetrated when confronted by the quickest of attackers. Sissoko led the charge on 57 minutes, sprinting away before releasing Ameobi on the right. His cross should have been cut out by Gary Cahill but he allowed it through to Cisse, who had only been on the pitch for four minutes, to score from close range with his first touch. Chelsea tried to respond. Certainly in terms of possession they were impressive. But despite sending on Didier Drogba, the chances never came. On 77 minutes, Eden Hazard hit the post, which was as close as it got. And yet within a minute, they were further behind. Colback, hugely impressive, first won the ball in midfield and then drove on to release Sissoko, who was through on goal. Courtois came out to block but the ball deflected into the path of Cisse, on hand, to steer in his second of the game. Finally, a subdued St James’ Park erupted. This was turning into an outstanding performance; and then Steven Taylor, in his eagerness, jeopardised it, scything through Andre Schurrle in the 81st minute. It was a clear red card, and barely a protest was registered. From the free-kick on 83 minutes, Fabregas curled the ball in and Alnwick, excellent until then, failed to come and collect, and Drogba simply headed home. Alnwick would redeem himself – saves from Costa and Felipe Luis in the dying minutes saved his team. His day, his manager’s day was complete.

Speculation has been growing that the ECB could be forced to remove him as their one-day leader before the tournament, which starts in February, should a string of poor results continue to coincide with his own lack of runs. But Cook’s captaincy was confirmed on Sunday, when England named a provisional 30-man party, which will shrink to a squad of 15 later this month. Alastair Cook has been given a vote of confidence after being named England's World Cup captain . The England skipper coaches local children during England's ODI tour of Sri Lanka . Only resignation or injury will prevent him from leading out his side against Australia at Melbourne for their World Cup opener on Valentine’s Day. But Sportsmail understands that England’s one-day policy will be rethought if Cook presides over another World Cup failure. Not since 1992 have an English side mounted a serious challenge for the trophy, and a sixth successive flop will draw a line under the one-day careers of some of the senior players — including Cook, Ian Bell and possibly James Anderson. Cook’s retention of the captaincy confirms the ECB’s belief that, having come through one of the most vitriolic summers an England skipper can ever have faced, he is the man most likely to repeat the trick in 50-over cricket. Warwickshire batsman Jonathan Trott is a notable exception from the 30-man provisional squad . Critics will argue that this is based more on hope than expectation. Either side of reaching the final of the 2013 Champions Trophy, England have lost five out of six bilateral one-day series — with the only victory coming under Stuart Broad’s leadership in the Caribbean earlier this year. And Cook has not scored a hundred in 56 international innings — Tests and one-dayers — managing only 12 half-centuries in that time and an average of 29. There is no place in the 30 for Jonathan Trott, who is yet to return to international cricket following his early departure from last winter’s Ashes with a stress-related illness. But Surrey’s 24-year-old dasher Jason Roy is included, along with the talented Hampshire batsman James Vince and Yorkshire seamer Jack Brooks. Fast bowlers James Anderson (left) and Stuart Broad will return after sitting out the Sri Lanka series . The decision to stick with Cook came only after a good deal of agonising but there was no appetite among the ECB hierarchy to sack their captain so close to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. A tri-series tournament with Australia and India starts in Sydney on January 16. The absence of viable alternatives has helped his cause. Eoin Morgan, who was due to captain the side in Sunday's fourth one-day international in Colombo following Cook’s suspension for slow over-rates, has been struggling for runs. Broad, meanwhile, has had injury problems and has been working his way back to fitness at a training camp in Potchefstroom in South Africa. The mood around the dressing room here in Sri Lanka was subdued until Wednesday’s surprise win in Hambantota reduced the deficit to 2-1 in the seven-match series. Eoin Morgan has been struggling for runs but is due to captain on Sunday . And wicketkeeper Jos Buttler, whose 37-ball unbeaten 55 finished the job in the company of Joe Root after a mid-innings wobble, insisted: ‘There’s a great buzz around the whole group, everyone communicates really well, everyone backs each other.’ ‘The best preparation for a World Cup would be to win this series, and get that feeling of knowing how to win games. ‘You could probably tell the other night that we hadn’t won many games recently so we probably made it a bit harder for ourselves than we could have.’ The task now facing England — and Cook, when he returns – is to start stringing one-day victories together.

"The 'broken windows' law . enforcement strategy of aggressively pursuing petty criminals is . coming under attack, after a grand jury this week decided not to . indict a New York police officer in the chokehold death of an . unarmed black man. Eric Garner died in July after a confrontation with police. Officers tried to arrest Garner based on complaints that he was . illegally selling cigarettes on a Staten Island sidewalk. The clash between Garner and police, captured on video, has . stoked a debate over the 'broken windows' concept that says . police should pursue small violations to create a larger . atmosphere of obedience and prevent other, more destructive . crimes. Furious: Protesters have staged a third night of rallies in New York following a grand jury's decision not to indict white police officer Daniel Pantaleo over the chokehold that killed black father-of-six Eric Garner . The idea dates back to the early 1980s and was popularized . by former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Republican who governed the . city from 1994 to 2001. Giuliani's first police commissioner was . Bill Bratton from 1994 to 1996 and Bratton is in the same . position under current Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat. Some say the theory has evolved into a zero tolerance policy . that has led to disproportionate responses by police. Speaking out: Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York struck out against what she called a disproportionate response to minor crimes . U.S. Representative Jose Serrano, a Democrat who represents . a largely minority community in New York City, said on Friday . that he has asked the U.S. Justice Department to investigate New . York's policing for small crimes. 'We should carefully evaluate how 'broken windows' is being . implemented in practice and how its enforcement may be . infringing on people's civil rights,' Serrano said. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined comment on . Serrano's request. Republicans this week also questioned whether police are . appropriately focusing their attention. Senator Rand Paul of . Kentucky blamed laws such as New York City's cigarette taxes . that give rise to illegal sales and other bad behavior. 'I think, my goodness, do we not have enough violence going . on in our community that really needs to be policed that we're . going to go harass people for selling cigarettes?' Paul said on . Fox News on Thursday. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York struck out . against what she called a disproportionate response to minor . crimes. Hands up: U.S. House Member Hakeem Jeffries, a black congressman from Brooklyn, New York, said he views some 'bad apple' police officers as a threat to his son. Jeffries called the Grand Jury's decision a 'stunning miscarriage of justice' Broken policing: In the ’90s, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton presided over a surge in petty-crime law enforcement on the theory that vigorously enforcing the small laws in some way dissuades or prevents people from breaking the big ones. There’s little evidence that theory is correct . 'When you have a man who was committing an arguably . low-level offense end up dead because of the use of lethal . force, you have an issue,' Gillibrand said on MSNBC on Friday. Police backers say programs like New York's 'stop and frisk' sets the standard that bad behavior will not be tolerated and . has reduced violent crime rates. Rudy Giuliani:  The former mayor built his career on scaring white New Yorkers with fears of black criminals . Last year, however, a  federal . judge found the city's use of that strategy constituted a form . of illegal racial profiling, and ordered major changes. The broken windows theory was introduced by two social . scientists in a 1982 magazine article and gained traction in New . York. It posits that poorly maintained urban environments with . dirty streets, abandoned buildings and the like attract crime, . while well-kept communities are more law-abiding. Giuliani, who is largely credited with popularizing the . strategy, could not be reached for comment on Friday. He said on . Fox News on Thursday that the police response to Garner was . justified because he did not cooperate with law enforcement. But critics say police have stretched the theory beyond its . original intent into an indiscriminate zero-tolerance policy. 'If the problem is a broken window they should fix the . window,' said City University of New York law school professor . Steve Zeidman. 'But somehow we don't fix the window, we just . arrest people who start hanging out by the broken window.' Stuart Gang, a retired New York City police officer, . defended the doctrine, saying it has increased the . responsiveness of law enforcement to a range of crimes. 'There . is nothing wrong with 'broken windows',' he said.","Death of Eric Garner at hands of NYPD shows old police strategy that doesn't work .
The 'broken windows' approach is from the '80s and aimed at tackling 'quality of life' crime .

"When Arsene Wenger trudged down the dressing-room tunnel at half-time, he looked like a man who was entering the sunset of a distinguished career. Arsenal were three goals down, their fans were numb and silent and the Stoke hordes were gloating fit to burst. Forty-five minutes later, with his side falling just a stride short of an extraordinary recovery, the manager’s head was higher. Yet he knew he had suffered a deeply damaging result. To make his mood still worse, he must have known that the score flattered Arsenal; that their recovery owed more to happy chance than to an urgent search for self-respect. Wenger delayed public criticism of his own team, initially offering a relatively tepid: ‘In every single game, you have to be committed and focused from the first moment.’ Later, his reaction was more scathing.

Click here for the full build up to Peter Crouch's remarkable 19th-second opening goal (above) for Stoke and all the other stats and heat maps in Sportmail's Match Zone . For, during those first 45 minutes, Stoke’s football was taken straight from the training ground. From the 19th second, when their opening goal hit the net, just about everything they attempted came off triumphantly. Festering enmity, along with a conviction that they have been consistently patronised by Wenger down the years, means that Arsenal are the scalp they treasure above all — and they set about claiming it with killing haste. Arsenal’s belated retrieval of their dignity finally foundered on the dismissal of Calum Chambers for a second yellow card, a poor decision which Wenger protested. But since his team had been helped along their way with a harsh penalty award, they attracted scant sympathy. That early goal was finely executed, yet abjectly defended. A ball played deep down the right was worked along the line to Steven Nzonzi via the head of Peter Crouch. The cross found Crouch leaping once again, causing chaos in the Arsenal defence. A rebound was procured and Crouch was left with a simple chance. Nineteen seconds and the stadium was booming out the anthems of triumph. Arsenal needed swift retaliation and they should have secured it after 10 minutes when Olivier Giroud missed a headed chance inside the six-yard box. But that was almost the sum total of Arsenal’s contribution. They accepted their fate all too easily. Bojan Krkic makes it 2-0 in the 35th minutes pushing his shot past Emiliano Martinez .

The crowd raised the noise level higher and their team responded. In the 35th minute, Stoke took a second goal of blissful simplicity, with Jonathan Walters whipping his diagonal cross to the brink of the six-yard box and Bojan stealing in to take the decisive touch. Arsenal’s shoulders, already sagging, sunk still further and genuine humiliation stared them in the face. They were listless beyond reason, second to every significant ball. For a team of elevated ambition, it was a genuinely wretched performance. ‘Two-nil to the rugby team,’ chorused the crowd, who have not forgotten Wenger’s ancient jibe. The Arsenal manager never left his seat. ‘They love me so much here, I didn’t want to give them the opportunity to show me their love,’ he said, his sarcasm heavier than his central defenders’ touch. And then, on the brink of half-time, it got even better for Stoke. A corner saw Crouch winning yet another header and Walters zestfully belting the chance into the roof of the net. Arsenal raised their game in the second half, the alternative being impossible. Danny Welbeck replaced Hector Bellerin and, in the 56th minute, Alexis Sanchez struck a post, having gone past three defenders and the keeper. Scoring was easier. But in the 65th minute they might have gone four down when Bojan skipped inside a non-existent challenge and drove his shot inside the post. ‘Everyone in the ground thought that was a goal but the ref saw an offside,’ said Mark Hughes. ‘At 4-0 it would have been over.’ Instead, the match went slightly mad. In the 68th minute, Arsenal were awarded what looked the softest penalty when Mathieu Flamini ran into the box and Mame Diouf was harshly adjudged to have made contact. Santi Cazorla devoured the kick and Arsenal belatedly discovered the urgency they had sought.

For the only time in the game, the ground fell silent, transfixed by the unthinkable. But then Chambers made an innocuous challenge and Anthony Taylor flaunted a second yellow. It seemed an absurdly unfair way to be sent off, but it killed the contest. Having watched Crouch fling arms and elbows all afternoon, Wenger was justified in taking offence. Yet it proved decisive.

"As a qualified teacher, Ronny Deila will be more familiar than most with half-term reports. This lunchtime clash at Motherwell marked six months in the Celtic Park hotseat for the Norwegian — and an appraisal of his performance so far would make for positive reading, if noting a need for improvement. On this evidence, Celtic will have no trouble in claiming their fourth-successive league title. It took a matter of minutes for them to carve open Motherwell here, with Anthony Stokes notching a simple goal after just six minutes. But if Deila's side continue to be as wasteful in front of goal as they were against a lacklustre Well side, the manager can forget any dreams of an elusive domestic Treble. John Guidetti, in particular, was guilty of spurning a number of chances which kept the Steelmen firmly in the game. Celtic's Anthony Stokes slots home the only goal of the game in his side's one goal victory at Motherwell . Stokes celebrates with his team-mates after scoring against Motherwell early on in the game at Fir Park . It was Stokes' sixth league goal of the season, helping the Bhoys to their second win in just four days . While Celtic still have great deal to do, though, they demonstrated at Fir Park that Scotland is still capable of classy, entertaining football, at least. At the end of a tumultuous week in which a fair few home truths about the national game were laid bare, this meeting of last season's top two clearly exhibited Scottish football's strengths and flaws. Snooker, boxing and darts impresario Barry Hearn tore into the SFA while speaking at their annual convention on Wednesday — highlighting the lack of sponsorship, alcohol ban and dwindling crowds as key factors in the Scottish game's decline. Yet Celtic boss Ronny Deila blasted back at the former Leyton Orient owner, standing up for the passionate atmosphere and exciting play he has witnessed during his brief tenure. This match certainly delivered noise in spades — due largely to the vast sea of green behind one goal — yet there were still swathes of empty seats in the home sections amongst the 7,740 crowd. This was in no small part to the disastrous start to the campaign endured by last season's runners up — a 1-1 draw at Parkhead in September was a meagre highlight in a campaign otherwise devoid of moments to savour. Iain Vigurs closes down Celtic captain Scott Brown during a temultuous fixture at Fir Park on Saturday . Tempers flared somewhat when Celtic's Scott Brown (third left) squared up to Motherwell's Iain Vigurs . It was a feisty affair and Celtic were on top of the game for the most part against a struggling Motherwell . Since then the goals — and performances — have dried up, with managerless Motherwell winning just once in nine and scoring only six. A run of five straight defeats drove Stuart McCall to call it a day and caretaker boss Kenny Black is yet to inspire a full-scale revival. Black has applied for the job although former Newcastle United midfielder Nolberto Solano has been strongly tipped to succeed McCall. In the first-half here, the Steelmen appeared every bit as uncertain as their off-field issues with Celtic dominating from the off. Having rubbished claims that Scotland was a long-ball nation in midweek, Deila practised what he preached as the Bhoys executed a passing masterclass — to the extent that even goalkeeper Craig Gordon resisted punting forwards in the opening 45. They should have been in front almost immediately when Scott Brown threaded a perfectly-weighted through pass to John Guidetti. The industrious Swede raced clear but dragged his finish wide of the upright. Despite having a hatful of chances Celtic were particularly wasteful in front of goal on Saturday afternoon . Virgil Van Dijk (right) tracks down Motherwell's John Sutton in his side's one-goal victory . But Celtic made amends moments later as Stefan Johansen, pressing high up the park, won the ball on the edge of the box. The Celtic No10 rounded the onrushing Dan Twardzik and cut back to Stokes, who slotted comfortably past the two Well defenders on the line. The hosts could not handle the combative Johansen and Nir Bitton — impressing in place of the injured Charlie Mulgrew — and Celtic soon created another opening. Bitton knocked the ball across to Brown, who instinctively let it run through his legs to James Forrest — taking Aleksandar Tonev's place wide right — in space to the right of the penalty area, but the winger could only fire wide. It took 15 minutes for Motherwell to even string two passes together and, when they did, Iain Vigurs blasted high and wide from distance. Moments later, Johansen was robbed by Vigurs on the far touchline and the midfielder embarked on a mazy run. Yet, with few team-mates in support, this rare glimmer of quality from the Steelmen proved futile. Celtic then spurned yet another chance. This time Bitton fed Guidetti just outside the box, who tucked a neat backheel to Johansen which the Norwegian drilled straight at Twardzik. Motherwell were forced into a change when right-back Fraser Kerr limped off and was replaced by David Ferguson. Motherwell's Simon Ramsden is sent off for this tackle on Celtic's James Forrest just after the hour mark . Ramsden's lunge on Forrest left Motherwell with a huge task as they looked for a second half equaliser . The visitors should have been 4-0 up at the break but could have gone in level when Motherwell fashioned a superb opportunity. Henrik Ojamaa found Josh Law out on the left and his drilled cross was touched behind before John Sutton could pounce. The Steelmen continued to press after the break — Estonian playmaker Ojamaa blazed wide after Virgil Van Dijk and Bitton failed to clear their lines. Despite lacking their first-half fluidity, the visitors still looked incredibly dangerous and Forrest almost doubled his side's advantage when his 18-yard shot was saved. Yet Motherwell's task was made even more difficult when Simon Ramsden was dismissed midway through the second period for a reckless lunge on Forrest on the edge of the area. Dead-ball specialist Guidetti could only find the Celtic supporters with the subsequent free-kick, but his side immediately sought to make their numerical prowess count. The 22-year-old fluffed his lines once more — somehow stumbling Izaguirre's cross from the left into Twardzik — before the keeper made an astonishing stop to deny Forrest from only two yards out. Black threw on Lionel Ainsworth and Lee Erwin and the substitutes came agonisingly close to snatching an unlikely leveller. Ainsworth swung an excellent ball in from the right which unmarked Erwin somehow nodded wide. The striker was then booked for diving in a bid to win a penalty and Gordon, for the first time, launched his goal kick to safety.","Victory at Fir Park is the second win in four days for Ronny Deila's men .

Subs: Jak Alnwick (on 46) 7.5 . Flattened Costa with his first involvement on professional debut and dealt well with string of crosses before two brilliant saves late on. Papiss Cisse (on 53) 8.5 . He scores goals, that’s what he does. Poached another pair from close range to win it for the hosts. Chelsea . Thibaut Courtois 6 . Made a crucial save from Colback at 0-0 and was let down by defence for Cisse double. Branislav Ivanovic 6.5 . Offered real danger down right and was unlucky when his crosses went without any takers. John Terry 6 . Not an easy afternoon against trickery of Perez. Gary Cahill 5 . To blame for United opener following wild clearance and had a poor game by his standards. Chelsea Thibaut Courtois can only watch as Cisse opens the scoring at St James' Park . Cesar Azpilicueta 6 . Tidy enough but did not give as much in attack as usual. John Obi Mikel 6 .

"Brendan Rodgers' decision to rest Steven Gerrard failed to pay dividends as even the Liverpool captain's emergence off the bench failed to inspire his side to break down a resolute Sunderland. Sportsmail's Dominic King rated the players' performances at Anfield. Liverpool (4-2-3-1) Simon Mignolet - 6.5 . A clean sheet against his old club. Wasn't subjected to the kind of pressure that might have exposed his brittle confidence. Glen Johnson - 7 . Lost possession at one point in the first half but, other than that, he was solid throughout and did all that was all that was asked of him. Martin Skrtel - 6.5 . Not given a moment to relax by Altidore. A couple of rash challenges before the break but, otherwise, steady in the man. Raheem Sterling was a bright spot in a disappointing display by Liverpool . Kolo Toure - 7 . Hasn't given Dejan Lovren any suggestion he will relinquish his place any time soon. The pick of Liverpool's defence, even if he looked to be carrying a groin problem. Alberto Moreno - 6 . Likes to make his presence felt in the opposite half of the field, as one surge in the second half proved, but can be careless when doing the job he is paid to. Lucas - 7 . Neat and tidy, protected the defence with his usual reliability. Had one shot in the second half that Pantilimon comfortably saved. Jordan Henderson - 6 . Usual hard work and covered plenty of miles but some of his passing in the second half lacked zip and he didn't get involved as much as he would have liked. Adam Lallana - 5.5 . A skilful player, for sure, but this was not a game for him to remember. Action tended to pass him by and he eventually made way for Gerrard. Liverpool defender Glen Johnson put in a solid performance on Saturday . Philippe Coutinho - 5.5 . Had two shots on target, either side of the break, and some of his trickery was impressive. But, again, he flattered to deceive and failed to see the game out. Raheem Sterling - 7.5 . The man most likely to find a breakthrough for long with his speed on the breaking and dancing feet. Gradually getting back to the standards he set himself. Rickie Lambert - 6 . Not quite at the level he had shown in previous games. No faulting his commitment and had a first half header saved but no other chances followed. Subs . Gerrard (for Lallana 65mina) 7; Markovic (for Coutinho 77mins) Unused Jones (GK), Enrique, Lovren, Can, Allen . Steven Gerrard came on as late sub but he was unable to help Liverpool grab a winner . Sunderland (4-1-4-1) Costel Pantilimon - 7 . Did everything that was asked of him; handled the ball with confidence and saved everything that was thrown his way. Confident display of goalkeeping. Santiago Vergini - 6.5 . Had the trouble of trying to contain Sterling; got booked for one foul but otherwise solid and played his part in getting a point. John O'Shea - 7.5 . Led by example and cruised through the game, won his headers and kept the back four organised. A thoroughly professional display. Wes Brown - 7 . One anxious moment late on when he tangled with Sterling but, in the main, he was never over-exerted trying to keep Lambert at arms' length. Anthony Reveillere - 7 . Did all that was asked of him, providing bite on the left hand side of Sunderland's defence. Even when Sterling switched flanks he remained composed. Liam Bridcutt - 8 . His outstanding afternoon was summed up when he flung himself in front of a shot from Henderson; ran himself to a standstill to protect his defence. Sunderland striker Conor Wickham put himself about and went close to breaking the deadlock . Adam Johnson - 5.5 . On the periphery, didn't provide any guile when it mattered. No surprise when his afternoon was brought to a premature end. Sebastian Larsson - 6 . Performed a diligent role but wasn't always accurate with the range of his passing and his normally accurate set pieces lacked precision. Jordi Gomez - 6.5 . Worked hard and there were no frills but he had the first shot of the game that flashed wide and contributed to what was a stoic Sunderland performance. Conor Wickham - 6.5 . Always involved, had a couple of shouts for penalty in the first half and then thrashed a volley wide after the break. It was the best chance of the game. Jozy Altidore - 5.5 . A physical presence who tried to bulldoze his way past Skrtel and Toure but never threatened to find a way past Mignolet and was eventually withdrawn. Subs . Alvarez (for Altidore 70mins 5), Buckley (for Johnson 79mins), Cattermole (for Larsson 70mins 5) Unused Mannone (GK), Rodwell, Fletcher, Robson .","Adam Lallana and Philippe Coutinho (5.5) struggled to make an impact .

"Hundreds of British suspected paedophiles have still not been arrested despite being named by Canadian police 18 months ago. Canadian detectives say they sent police ‘hundreds of names’ of people who viewed ‘horrific’ child abuse videos distributed from Toronto by a crime ring. Globally, 348 arrests have been made and 386 children rescued. Massive haul: Canadian police ran Project Spade, one of the largest child porn operations they've ever seen . But yesterday it emerged not one person was arrested in the UK despite their details being handed to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre, which tracks paedophiles. Experts said that police are struggling to cope with the sheer number of people suspected of viewing child abuse online. This year the Daily Mail revealed only one in 15 people caught viewing such images is arrested. John Carr, an expert in fighting online abuse, said the news was ‘sad but not surprising’. Global collaboration: More than 30 police . officers from around the world gathered to announce the end of a three-year . child pornography investigation in Toronto, 18 months after naming hundreds of British suspects . ‘We are going to have to find new and better ways of dealing with this type of crime,’ he said. Canada’s Operation Spade started in 2010 and has worked with Interpol in more than 50 countries. More than 350,000 images and 9,000 videos of child sexual abuse have been found.

"Sheffield United eased into the FA Cup third round at Plymouth’s expense in a tale of three penalties. League Two Argyle were left to wonder what might have been had Reuben Reid not skewed a spot-kick into the stand early in the second half. They were punished in ruthless fashion by Jose Baxter, who sent the League One promotion contenders through with two textbook penalties.

Sheffield United players congratulate Baxter as the Blades secure their place in the FA Cup third round .

Referee: Gary Sutton (Lincolnshire) Attendance: 7,348 (638 away) And the impressive Marc McNulty rounded off the win in the final minute, sweeping in a right-wing cross from Florent Cuvelier. The Blades battled their way to the semi-finals in this competition last season - losing in an eight-goal thriller to Hull City - but Wembley in the springtime was a world removed from this. On a chilly afternoon, Bramall Lane was barely a third full and those that did turn up had to endure a pretty soporific first-half. The hosts, who needed a replay to beat Crewe in round one, started the brighter and skipper Michael Doyle wasn’t too far wide with a 25-yard sighter after Michael Higdon had teed him up. A couple of minutes later, Ryan Flynn roared forward from right-back and his firmly-struck shot was pushed clear by Luke McCormick. Plymouth, who saw off Conference North outfit AFC Fylde to reach the second round, threatened sporadically. Jason Banton was their liveliest player and keen to make an impression having not started a match since mid-September. He swapped passes with Andy Kellett as Argyle sprung forward but the latter was pulled up by referee Gary Sutton for diving in the box. Banton also dragged an effort wide after Lewis Alessandra intercepted a loose Stefan Scougall pass and raced down the right flank.

For a while, the League Two promotion challengers were setting the pace and Dominic Blizzard enjoyed their best chance of the half, firing across goal and wide after Banton played him in. United, who have a Capital One Cup quarter-final with Southampton coming up on Tuesday week, roused themselves and Flynn was able to cut inside and roll the ball just wide of the post. The second half could only be an improvement and Plymouth immediately had a chance to steal the lead. Alessandra got goal side of Jay McEveley and was dragged to the turf for a clear penalty. But, in front of the end where the 638 travelling fans were gathered, Reid sliced his spot-kick into the stand. It was a massive let-off for the Blades and they went straight on the offensive, with half-time substitute McNulty firing a fraction wide. McNulty was making quite an impact and when Ben Purrington grappled with him as he tried to break into the Argyle area, the referee had no hesitation in awarding another spot-kick.

And just after the hour, United were awarded another penalty when Peter Hartley brought down Jamie Murphy in the area. Again, Baxter made no mistake. Baxter had an excellent chance to complete his hat-trick with 12 minutes left but missed the target when well placed. His job was done, however, and he received a standing ovation when replaced in the final five minutes as the Blades made further Cup gains.","Sheffield United reached the FA Cup third round by beating Plymouth .

"Bolton stretched their unbeaten Sky Bet Championship run to five matches with an uninspiring goalless draw with Reading at the Madejski Stadium. Both teams provided more entertaining fare after a poor first half but neither could break the deadlock and Bolton needed some late heroics from goalkeeper Andy Lonergan to take a share of the points.

Referee: Keith Hill . In contrast, Reading's form has been wildly inconsistent. Their 2-1 win at Norwich last weekend, thanks to a brace from defender Jake Cooper, was only their third victory in 12 league outings. Bolton were unable to use 36-year-old former Chelsea and Barcelona striker Eidur Gudjohnsen, who has joined the club for a second spell, as his international clearance did not come through in time. But they began brightly against Reading's stifling five-strong midfield, with Max Clayton flashing a low centre across the face of the home goal. However, no team-mate was on hand to provide the vital touch. Reading responded quickly from a Jordan Obita corner on the right. Michael Hector nodded it on but Glenn Murray was unable to get a clean connection at the far post and headed tamely wide. Michael Hector goes close with a headed shot as Reading and Bolton draw 0-0 in the Championship . In a scrappy first half, neither side offered much imagination. Obita should have done better when latching on to a Garath McCleary cross but showed poor control and the chance went begging. Bolton's early promise had faded and Reading tried to up the tempo. McCleary took too long over a shot from outside the area, which was blocked, and a 20-yard Oliver Norwood free-kick flew harmlessly over. Just before half time, an Obita corner ricocheted among a mass of bodies until landing at Murray's feet, but his close-range effort struck McCleary and rebounded to safety. Murray thought he had enjoyed better fortune soon after half-time, when he netted from Cooper's nod down, but he was ruled offside. Oliver Norwood (centre) of Reading is closed down by Neil Danns (left) and Tim Ream (right) Bolton retaliated, with Tim Ream's close-range header forcing a good save from home goalkeeper Adam Federici, before Reading launched a fierce assault. In the space of only a few minutes, centre back Hector missed three good chances - nodding over an Obita corner, slicing a shot wide and then being denied by Lonergan's agile save from his firm header. With the game opening up, at last, Bolton also counter-attacked swiftly. Darren Pratley went close with a powerful cross-shot and Ream missed the target when unguarded at the far post. But Bolton were again indebted to Lonergan near the end when he made a stunning one-handed save to keep out a stinging 25-yard attempt by Danny Williams.","Eidur Gudjohnsen rejoined Bolton on a short-term deal this week .

"Stoke held on to beat Arsenal 3-2 after a dramatic afternoon at the Britannia Stadium.  The result brought an end to Arsenal's run of three successive wins and ended a losing sequence of three for the hosts. Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan rated the players' performances at the Britannia Stadium. Stoke (4-2-3-1) Asmir Begovic - 6.5 . Had next-to-nothing to do, but performed admirably when called upon. Made one super save from Danny Welbeck. Phil Bardsley - 7.5 . A real presence down the right hand side. Bundle of energy and has improved in an attacking sense. Ryan Shawcross - 8 . A game made for Shawcross. Olivier Giroud was reduced to moaning and bleating purely because he got no change out of the Stoke skipper. England calling? Arsenal defender Callum Chambers was given a chasing and eventually sent of . Marc Muniesa - 7.5 . Really like the look of the ex-Barcelona man. Never rash and is a keen reader of the game alongside the brute force of Shawcross. Erik Pieters - 6 . Did struggle against Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on occasion, but Arsenal didn’t get it wide nearly enough for this to become a contributive factor. Steven Nzonzi - 8 . Another immense performance in the middle of the park. Rough enough to put it about but also capable of switching play quickly. Geoff Cameron - 7 . Did his job in nullifying the Arsenal midfield, but didn’t have to work overly hard to do that. Bojan produced his best display in a red and white shirt since arriving from Barcelona . Mame Biram Diouf - 7.5 . Becoming a bit of a handful for full backs nowadays. Tall enough to cause problems in the air and quick on the break. Bojan - 8.5 . Best display in a red and white shirt. Buzzed in behind Peter Crouch and showed just why those at Barcelona thought he’d take on the world. Inventive performance as he continues to grow into the Premier League. Jon Walters - 8 . Played wide right, where he began his career, and still has the turn of pace over three yards to make him a handful. Direct and knows exactly where strikers want balls in. Peter Crouch - 8 . Had the time of his life. Won most headers, as you’d expect, and linked up wonderfully with the home midfield. Won’t score an easier goal. Jon Walters was moved out to the right and was a handful for Arsenal defence . Arsenal (4-2-3-1) Emiliano Martinez - 5 . Somewhat unsurprisingly radiates zero confidence but this result wasn’t down to the goalkeeper. An unwitting bystander to the shambles in front of him. Hector Bellerin - 5 . Stumbled as Crouch put Stoke ahead, but got forward encouragingly. Calum Chambers - 3.5 . Farcical defending for the opening goal - hadn’t woken up. Looked ruffled by Peter Crouch all afternoon. Was given a chasing and eventually sent off. Arsenal's German international defender Per Mertesacker had an afternoon to forget . Per Mertesacker - 3 . Looked in a daze from the word go. Strange performance, given the lack of Koscielny required the German to take charge. Abysmal. Kieran Gibbs - 5 . How can an international defender allow Jon Walters to consistently whip balls in from wide? Not good enough but wasn’t helped by the lack of talking to his right. Mathieu Flamini - 5.5 . Game passed him by, couldn’t get to grips with Steven Nzonzi’s physicality or Bojan dropping off into pockets. Decent drive for the penalty. Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey failed to take control of the game . Aaron Ramsey - 6 . Unsure whether he was playing or not. You can talk all you want about sub-plots, but the facts are that Ramsey failed to get hold of a game he should be bossing. Nice volley for the second goal, but wasn’t himself. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - 7 . One bright spark for the Gunners. Mystifying why Arsene Wenger doesn’t give him a run in the side, but he may have to after this. Alexis Sanchez - 7 . His thinking is almost too quick for the rest; Sanchez cut a frustrated figure but individually played well. Santi Cazorla - 6 . Showed very little reason to suggest why Wenger keeps faith with him. Too cute, not enough bite in possession. Barely scored from the spot. Olivier Giroud - 4 . In a word: lazy. Not a focal point, missed an absolute sitter when one-down and didn’t appear to want to be here. Subs . Danny Welbeck (for Bellerin - 46) - Showed his intent straight away and came closer than anyone had previously come to scoring. Summed the afternoon up. 6.5 . Lukas Podolski (for Giroud - 63) - Didn’t really get himself involved. 5 .","Inventive Stoke forward Bojan (8.5) was man of the match .

"Ryder Cup star Patrick Reed is set to be punished by the PGA Tour after a foul-mouthed outburst on the opening day of the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai. While playing partner Graeme McDowell claimed a two-shot lead with a five-under-par 67 at Sheshan International - despite dropping two shots in the last six holes - Reed was turning the air blue. Reed was just four off the pace after a round of 71, but the American faces a hefty fine after being caught on camera not only swearing at himself, but also using language which could be interpreted as being homophobic. VIDEO Scroll down to watch . Patrick Reed (above) faces punishment from the PGA Tour for his foul-mouthed outburst in Shanghai . Reed carded a one-under par round of 71, but lost his temper after a three-putt for a bogey on his tenth hole . Reed was often seen reacting to the crowds at Gleneagles while playing in the Ryder Cup in October . Television commentators swiftly apologised after Reed was clearly heard saying 'Nice f****** three-putt you f****** f****t,' after a bogey on the first hole, his 10th of the day. Ironically, Reed also attracted attention on his Ryder Cup debut at Gleneagles for indicating to the crowd to keep quiet by putting a finger to his lips during his singles win over Henrik Stenson. A PGA Tour spokesperson later said: 'The PGA Tour's Conduct Unbecoming regulations prohibit the use of obscene language on the golf course. The PGA Tour will deal with this matter internally in accordance with its regulations.' The PGA Tour has a policy of not disclosing any disciplinary sanctions it issues. McDowell began on the back nine and played his first 12 holes in seven under par. But he then failed to get up and down from a greenside bunker on the fourth and paid the price for what he called 'a comedy of errors' on the par-five eighth, where he missed his only fairway of the day and also pulled his approach left of the green. 'A big key to this golf course is driving the ball well,' McDowell said. 'I drove it very well today. I think I missed only one fairway, which is very important and the greens are in fantastic shape and I actually putted very well. Graeme McDowell (above) leads the event in Shanghai after round one with a five-under 67 . 'Seven under par through 12 holes was a beautiful start. I dropped a couple coming in, but all in all, I am very, very pleased with five under par on what I thought was a reasonably tricky day. 'This is as tough off the tee as I think I've ever seen this golf course. Obviously it was very low scoring here last year (Dustin Johnson won on 24 under par). The rough was fairly thick last year, but it played so much softer and effectively, the fairways played wider and the greens were so much more receptive.' McDowell failed to advance to the knock-out stages in the defence of his Volvo World Match Play title last month, but finished joint 16th in the BMW Masters on Sunday and believes he is well placed to take advantage of the lucrative events at the end of the season. 'This stage of the season has always been a part of the season I've enjoyed,' the 35-year-old said. 'I think historically I've played five, six, seven in a row this time of the year and I've kind of prepared myself for this stage of the year. 'The only stage of the season that I struggle with at the minute is that end of August, September period when they are giving away a lot of money in the States (in the FedEx Cup play-offs). That's been the hard part of the season for me the last four years. McDowell of Northern Ireland plays his second shot in to the ninth hole in Shanghai . VIDEO McDowell takes early lead in Shaghai . Germany's Martin Kaymer (above) is also in contention after coming in at three-under par in his first round . 'But this part of the season, I typically take three or four weeks off in or around the Ryder Cup and prepare myself for this and I've normally played fairly well.' McDowell had strapping on his left wrist but was quick to allay any injury fears, adding: 'It's nothing sinister. It's just a result of some stuff I'm working on in my swing at the minute, especially my short game. I'm really trying to throw the club head hard at the ball and it's putting more strain in my left wrist than I'm used to.' Martin Kaymer's 69 was matched by England's Tommy Fleetwood to ensure the pair shared second place with South African Tim Clark and American trio Rickie Fowler, Chris Kirk and Brandt Snedeker. It continued US Open champion Kaymer's impressive record at the venue. 'It's a good start and I really enjoy playing here anyway,' said Kaymer, who shot a final round of 63 on his way to victory in 2011 and also holds the course record of 62. 'Even when I was at level par today I just kept telling myself, you enjoy the golf course so much, and you will have plenty of birdie chances, so you just need to wait. Fortunately today on the back nine, it turned out well.' Lee Westwood and last year's runner-up Ian Poulter were among an 11-strong group on two under par which included world number two Adam Scott and Stenson, while Justin Rose had to settle for a level-par 72.

CLICK HERE for all the stats and heat maps from Anfield including Sunderland midfielder Liam Bridcutt's in a man-of-the-match display (above) With an important Champions League game against Basel coming next, not to mention a trip to Manchester United next Sunday, Brendan Rodgers made a sensible decision in starting with Steven Gerrard on the bench on Saturday. When, however, the result of that is a performance much like their display against Stoke the previous weekend, when Rodgers decided he needed to start resting 34-year-old Gerrard for certain games, there is sure to be a heightened sense of anxiety. In fairness to Rodgers and his players, their football improved before Gerrard was unleashed from the bench in the second half against Stoke that concluded with a winning goal from Glen Johnson. But there was a lack of urgency in that first-half display that was evident again here, and a lack of authority in the midfield area Gerrard so likes to command. Until he came on in the 66th minute, Liverpool were unimpressive, although credit should be given to a Sunderland defence well organised by Gus Poyet. The home side were tentative when they should have been attacking with real intensity, fearful of what Sunderland might do to them when they should have had the confidence to be crushing their visitors.

If Rodgers thought his players had shown great character to respond as they had after their dreadful defeat at Crystal Palace, and he said as much in his programme notes, there was little sign of it during this encounter. It clearly worries supporters who were strangely quiet until Gerrard came on as a replacement for Adam Lallana. They can see it too. They can see how Gerrard almost single-handedly raised the tempo of Liverpool’s play, just as they can see the size of the task facing Rodgers: the need to identify new leaders now that Luis Suarez and Jamie Carragher have gone and Gerrard could be leaving too if he decides against signing the new contract he has been offered. Even though Gerrard was unable to inspire a goal that would have secured a third successive league win for Liverpool, Rodgers acknowledged the need to find players who can fill the void in his captain’s absence. ‘It is very hard to replace that quality,’ said Rodgers. ‘You see that pass when Stevie first came on; not too many in the whole league could play that, that quality. He still has that talent, he has world-class ability and that is something of course we will need. ‘But we can’t always rely on Stevie. His talent is world class but that contribution has to come from the team. It can’t be up to him every single game to be the catalyst. He was excellent when he came on and of course he plays on Tuesday.’ Liverpool are lacking in other areas too. They have scored just seven league goals at home this season — only Aston Villa and Burnley have inferior records — and that owes much to the absence of Daniel Sturridge. But what they really missed was any stature in midfield, which was something Sunderland clearly tried to exploit. Gerrard immediately took the captain's armband from team-mate Jordan Henderson upon his second half arrival .

At times Liverpool’s back four almost buckled, with Martin Skrtel forced to make a desperate challenge to deny the advancing Connor Wickham. Sunderland’s appeals for a penalty were ignored, which looked just about fair enough. Liverpool responded with a purposeful attack down the right flank, Rickie Lambert meeting Adam Lallana’s cross with a header that flew only narrowly wide. And it was not long before Liverpool threatened again, with Philippe Coutinho unleashing a low shot that finished up in the side- netting. But it amounted to a fairly uninspiring first half, with Liverpool creating just those two chances. The second half started much like the first had concluded, with Sunderland showing more energy and determination until Gerrard injected fresh impetus into Liverpool. The home side were better then, for sure. Coutinho unleashed two reasonable efforts, the second of which forced a fine save from Costel Pantilimon after a terrific run from Raheem Sterling, who then felt he should have been awarded a penalty after a challenge by Wes Brown. It would have been harsh, and it was not even mentioned by Rodgers afterwards. But then he had wider, more significant concerns.

He will certainly be the most relieved, as Neil Warnock’s men squandered numerous chances to inflict another home defeat for Spurs. In explaining his side’s lacklustre display, Pochettino said: ‘We are frustrated, like the fans. ‘The team did not show freshness of other games, maybe because we played three games in six days. ‘It makes a difference if you have two days for recovery and the other team has three days [Palace played Aston Villa on Tuesday, Spurs played Chelsea on Wednesday]. ‘That extra day is massive but it is not an excuse.

Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . Maybe Warnock’s threat to cancel Christmas had something to do with his team’s vibrancy yesterday. ‘I told them they couldn’t have their party if they lost, so they can have it now,’ he said. ‘I leave disappointed but proud we’ve got a point. We had a chance to get three points at White Hart Lane, there’s not many chances to do that now at my age.’ And the signs were there from the get-go, as Palace, in true Warnock style, made life difficult for the hosts. Christian Eriksen nearly opened the scoring for Spurs in the seventh minute, firing into the side-netting after nutmegging Martin Kelly on the left-hand byline. But — led by left-winger Yannick Bolasie — Palace could easily have found themselves ahead in the opening 20 minutes. Ryan Mason’s attempt at a defensive header from Bolasie’s inswinging corner went inches from nestling inside Hugo Lloris’s far post in the 17th minute. Three minutes later James McArthur should have hit the target after Bolasie produced an outrageous piece of skill to leave Eric Dier — who had a torrid afternoon at right-back — and Eriksen for dead, before finding the Scot inside the area. Spurs had chances of their own, Julian Speroni saving Eriksen’s free-kick before the Dane stood up a cross that Roberto Soldado should have buried. By the hour mark, the home crowd were restless. The team that had looked to be getting to grips with Pochettino’s high-pressing style in the early stages of their 3-0 loss at Chelsea was nowhere to be seen. With 13 minutes left, Jason Puncheon went close to giving Palace the lead they so deserved — hammering a shot on to the bar. Seconds later, he had the ball in the net — but referee Lee Mason had blown for offside. Puncheon was in the thick of the action again, waltzing through and finding Bolasie with a cut back — but his strike was superbly saved. The Palace bench could not believe it. Nor could the home fans. A chorus of boos echoed round White Hart Lane. They were even louder at full-time.

Lloris produced the first meaningful save of the second period, denying Zaha after the winger skipped past Eriksen in the 55th minute. By this point, home supporters were getting restless. They have suffered so much at White Hart Lane already this season. Spurs looked like they were finally getting to grips with Pochettino's high-pressing tactics during the opening 20 minutes of their 3-0 loss at Chelsea on Wednesday. Make no bones about it, they had the champions elect rattled in their own backyard. The tables were turned, Palace were forcing Spurs onto the back-foot and the home side were struggling to find answers.

Puncheon was in the thick of the action again with nine minutes left to play, waltzing through Spurs right-side before finding Bolasie with a cut back - but the forward's firm strike was superbly saved by Lloris. The Palace bench couldn't believe it. Nor could the home supporters, as a chorus of boos echoed round White Hart Lane. Aaron Lennon was introduced for the final seven minutes, as Spurs looked for an undeserved winner.

"Charlie Austin experienced the highs and lows of football in Queens Park Rangers' win against his former club Burnley – setting up one and scoring another before being sent off late on. This win will be vital in QPR's chances of avoiding relegation this season and their moments of quality proved too much, with two moves which punctured a poor quality affair and punished their opponents. The first goal on 51 minutes was a swift, passing move. Austin played a one-two with Bobby Zamora, whose return pass skilfully slipped in the striker. Austin committed a defender then passed into Leroy Fer who took a touch before finishing – the ball hitting Ben Mee and looping up agonisingly over Tom Heaton who had rushed from Burnley's goal. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats . Leroy Fer celebrates scoring from close range to put QPR into the lead in the hard-fought relegation battle at Loftus Road .

A single strike did not look like winning the match but Austin finished off his former club by finishing off another fine move with 15 minutes to play. This time Eduardo Vargas exchanged passes with Mauricio Isla on the right, then cut the ball back to Austin who buried a low strike. It was a fine display from QPR's top scorer, until he was sent off two minutes later. Already on a yellow card for a late challenge on Kieran Trippier, Austin led with an elbow to contest a ball and caught Michael Keane. Referee Jonathan Moss did not hesitate to book him again and produce a red. Manager Harry Redknapp agreed that the two yellow cards were warranted, but added: 'He is not a nasty type of player at all. He was trying to defend and put shift in. He scored again which is great for us.' This fixture at Loftus Road last season in the Championship was 3-3, described by Joey Barton in the match-day programme as a 'ding-dong' affair. A few more displays like this and Burnley will be back there next season. Surprisingly, the visitors were the dominant side of the first half and QPR relied on goalkeeper Rob Green, extending his fine form of recent weeks, to keep the score level. On 12 minutes he was, admittedly, at fault when he dropped Dean Marney's cross straight into the path of Scott Arfield, but his reactions to dive to his left to stop the follow-up effort were lightning. He was tested once more just before the half-hour mark. The ball came back out from a Burnley corner to George Boyd, who hit a swerving drive from 25-yards which was curving into the top right corner until the QPR goalkeeper tipped it on to the right post.

'I was behind it and as soon as he hit it I said, “That's in.” How he got his fingertips to that I don't know. He's a great keeper. You go one down and it takes the momentum away, he kept us in it at 0-0.' QPR suddenly realised they were playing at home to a side who they need to be beating if they want any chance of staying in the top flight. Vargas carved out a chance for himself, running down the right flank and cutting inside before beating Heaton with a low shot only to see defender Keane block on the line. As the whistle went for half-time two teams traipsed off who knew how crucial the next 45 minutes could be to defining their season. It was Harry Redknapp's side who took the initiative early in the second half with Fer's strike, but Burnley would not lie down. Six minutes after they went behind, Boyd flashed a ball across the box from the left-hand side and Barnes was there at the back post of a tap-in only for Richard Dunne to stick out a leg and somehow not send the ball into his own net. Then Danny Ings sent a back-post header inches wide of the left post, teed up by a deep cross from the right by Marney. Burnley manager Sean Dyche said: 'Green's made a worldy save. We need to be more clinical. We have been earlier in the season and we weren't enough against QPR. 'The performance was good, there was organisation, energy, quality, we're putting in the right mixture but we need to win games. We have to turn that into wins.'

"For obvious reasons, the chances of one sport completing a clean sweep of the main prizes at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards are slim indeed. But, as the panel comprising sports stars, sports editors and BBC bigwigs prepares to convene to set the ball rolling ahead of the big announcements on December 14, let’s put the case for golf breaking the mould and completing this particular triple crown. Let’s start with Team of the Year. Did anyone put in a performance that came close to Europe’s steamrollering of the Americans in the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in September? Europe captain Paul McGinley celebrates victory in the Ryder Cup . It’s not easy dealing with great expectation. Just ask England’s footballers. But Europe’s team delivered to a man to trigger a post-mortem in America that still rages. You can understand their angst. How does a nation with such a strong college golf system and the most glamorous tour in the world keep losing? But doesn’t that underline the scale of Europe’s achievement? For Coach of the Year, it surely has to be Paul McGinley. For two years, the Irishman poured everything he had into the role of Europe’s captain. Never mind not leaving any stones unturned; McGinley never left any grains of sand unturned. Regarding that heavy burden of expectation, what an inspired move it was to seek the counsel of Sir Alex Ferguson, the man who dealt so brilliantly with it all his working life. Europe steamrollered the Americans in the Ryder Cup . That was just one of many moves which made McGinley the best Ryder Cup captain since Tony Jacklin. And so to the main award itself, the one decided on the night by the viewers. Since it began in 1954, only two golfers have won it — Dai Rees, for captaining Britain and Ireland to victory in the Ryder Cup in 1957 and Sir Nick Faldo for winning his first Masters in 1989. A quarter-century on, the case for a third is so overwhelming it would, quite frankly, damage the credibility of the award if Rory McIlroy didn’t win it. Lewis Hamilton is his only conceivable rival and, no doubt, the motor racing fraternity will lobby as powerfully as ever. But let’s be honest. If Hamilton was in any other car but a Mercedes he wouldn’t be close to claiming F1’s main prize. He’s effectively winning a two-car race. McIlroy has put together the greatest season in the history of European golf. Rory McIlroy has put together the greatest season in the history of European golf. Even Faldo’s best season didn’t come close. The Northern Irishman didn’t just win two majors, he won the European Tour’s flagship event plus one of the four WGC events that sit one rung below the majors. There was also a singles display at the Ryder Cup so good it had some of the nation’s leading sportswriters comparing him to other superstars who transcend their game, like Messi and Ronaldo. A clean sweep for one sport? Admittedly, it is asking an awful lot. But then this was the year our golfers delivered an awful lot. A rare duff shot by Garcia . Given how good it has been to see him play with a smile on his face again this year, it is with a heavy heart that I take Sergio Garcia to task. But the fact is, he let European golf down badly last week. The first event of the four-tournament Final Series to conclude the season sees lots of money at stake in Shanghai courtesy of loyal sponsor BMW. Sergio Garcia sent out wrong message by snubbing Shanghai for Malaysia . Garcia has a golden chance to close the gap on Rory McIlroy, the man leading the Race to Dubai, who has been detained in Ireland by his lawyers. So what does Garcia do? The Spaniard decides to play in the PGA Tour event in Malaysia instead. Yes, I’m sure the appearance money was good. But did he not stop for a minute to think what sort of message this sends out? How are the rest of us supposed to get interested in the Final Series concept if the No 2 can’t be bothered to show up? Just to complete BMW’s week, the tournament was won by Marcel Siem — sponsored by Mercedes. On the European Tour website, full marks for creativity to the photographer who got Siem to hold the trophy at just the right angle to block out the massive Mercedes logo on the German’s shirt. Quote of the week . ‘For some weird reason, I had this gut feeling I may make another one. When I saw the ball land and kick towards the hole, I thought, “Wow, this is actually going to happen”.’ One week after winning a £40,000 Buick for a hole in one in China, LPGA Tour player Danielle Kang (above) travelled to Taiwan, where she won a £40,000 Audi following another ace.

"Airport regulations saw former England and Liverpool striker Michael Owen endure his very own travel 'torture' on Tuesday. The former footballer-turned-horseracing owner was travelling back to the UK from the US on a British Airways flight after attending the famous Santa Anita Breeders' Cup meeting. Scheduled for a fly-in to London Heathrow Airport from Los Angeles, thick fog meant the flight had to be diverted to Manchester. Michael Owen, pictured at the Breeders Cup, caused a Twitter storm after complaining of his travel 'torture' Click here to read 'Michael Owen in hot water over Newcastle-Liverpool snub' The irony is, Owen's original plans were to end up in Manchester via transfer from Heathrow. However, once the plan was grounded in the north west, it wasn't quite the stroke of luck that the 34-year-old had hoped for. Owen, who ended his playing career with Stoke City after three years at Manchester United, took to Twitter to inform the world of his 'travel torture' writing: 'Been told I can't get off. Got to wait on plane for over an hour to then fly to Heathrow and miss my flight back up to Manchester. #Torture.' Owen planned to end up in Manchester but was forced to stay on the plane, fly to London and then back again . But it was his next, possible tongue-in-cheek tweet that saw him come in for criticism on the social networking site. Owen added: 'Please BA, let me walk off the plane and into my Dads car. I want to pick my kids up from school and don't need to go to Heathrow and back.' Conor Waters replied: 'Go through security like the rest of us,' while Barry Smith added: 'Sure there's many other ppl on the plane with same dilemmas #civilianlife.' Owen spent three years at Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson before finishing his career with Stoke . One Twitter user jokingly asked for the former Premier League forward to be left 'on the plane forever' Keeping his 2.99 million followers up to date of how his frustrating day was going, Owen later Tweeted that he had missed picking his children up, but had managed to squeeze on another flight out of Heathrow. As Sportsmail's Charles Sale reported in Wednesday's Daily Mail, Owen chose to watch his horse Brown Panther run in the Breeders’ Cup meeting in the States rather than work on BT Sport’s Newcastle v Liverpool match last Saturday. BT are understood to have been disappointed by Owen’s decision to put his racing interests before his football commitments and have made that very clear to him. So much so that if Owen misses another game in similar circumstances, there could be a parting of the ways. Michael Owen won every domestic trophy and is best remembered for the goals he scored at Liverpool .","Owen was planning on ending up in Manchester via Heathrow transfer .

"Arsene Wenger didn’t mince his words in a brutal assessment of Arsenal’s capitulation at Stoke, branding his back four ‘soft’ and ‘tender’. The Gunners were shambolic defensively and lacked gumption going forward as their winless run at the Britannia Stadium stretched to a fourth year. Behind inside 19 seconds thanks to Peter Crouch, Arsenal conceded twice more before the break with Bojan and then Jon Walters pouncing on gifts. Goals through a Santi Cazorla penalty and Aaron Ramsey volley saw the visitors rally, but the damage had already been done. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger shows his frustration in the dugout during the game at the Britannia . Wenger believes Calum Chambers’ second half sending off late in the game was unjust . Charlie Adam was yellow carded for his rash challenge on Alexis Sanchez near the end of the match . And Wenger, who asserts Calum Chambers’ second half sending off was unjust, couldn’t hide his frustration at a lack of leadership and organisation. ‘We gave them a present,’ he said. ‘We were too tender at the back from the start today. When we responded it was too late in the game. You have to be committed and focused from the first minute. ‘We were a bit soft to cope with what they offered us. Stoke started strongly and we were not decisive enough in the defensive challenges.’ Peter Crouch is the toast of Stoke after opening the scoring for the Potters against Arsenal after one minute . Bojan Krkic makes it 2-0 in the 35th minutes pushing his shot past Emiliano Martinez . Provider for the second, Walters celebrates getting himself on the scoresheet with Bojan on hand to join him . Nineteen-year-old Hector Bellerin made only his second Premier League start and 22-year-old Emiliano Martinez was in goal; Wenger chose to bemoan a lack of experience in his back five - even though World Cup winner Per Mertesacker, Kieran Gibbs and Chambers were all available. ‘You have to give Stoke credit,’ he added. ‘I think we were a bit inexperienced at the back. We could not play Laurent Koscielny or Nacho Monreal.’ Koscielny wasn’t risked, sitting on the bench, and could only watch on as Arsenal floundered, with Wenger heavily criticising referee Anthony Taylor for sending off Chambers late on to compound their misery. Santi Cazorla slots home a penalty as Arsenal's fight back commences in the second half . ‘It was a bad decision. If Chambers has to go off today I’ll watch the game again with you and show five more players who should go,’ he said. Charlie Adam appeared to be one guilty party, grabbing hold of Alexis Sanchez’s neck in a tackle. ‘I don’t want to comment too much on the referee but watch the game again and watch what happened on the pitch,’ Wenger added. ‘I don’t think he deserved to be sent off compared to other people who put arms and elbows in faces.’ The Frenchman didn’t leave his dugout seat for the entirety - blaming the ferocity of the home crowd. Asked why he remained seated, Wenger joked: ‘One single reason. They love me so much here that I didn’t want to give them an opportunity to show me their love.’ Head here to Like our Arsenal Facebook page.

"Protesters have staged a third night of rallies in New York following a grand jury's decision not to indict white police officer Daniel Pantaleo over the chokehold that killed black father-of-six Eric Garner. Authorities arrested 20 people as they attempted to appease the crowds by insisting prosecutors will consider charges against the officer who fatally shot 28-year-old Brooklyn father Akai Gurley in November. And Eric Garner's daughter, Erica, revealed she does not believe racism played a role in her father's death. However, hundreds of people gathered at various locations in the city - and elsewhere across the United States -  to denounce the use of deadly force against minorities, which they believe to be motivated attacks under the guise of control. Scroll down for video . Day three: Hundreds of protesters brought New York's Apple store on Fifth Avenue to a standstill on Friday . Blocked off: Police handcuff demonstrators who walked onto the FDR Drive in Manhattan and stopped cars . Operation: A number of white zip ties lie on the ground as NYPD detain one of those involved in the protests . Unrest: The crowds held up signs and shouted chants about alleged police racism in New York and the US . With their hands up, in reference to slain black teenager Michael Brown, they chanted 'black lives matter' It is the third day of unrest after a jury refused to indict a white NYPD officer over the death of a black man . More than one hundred people stormed into an Apple Store on Central Park South and Fifth Avenue to stage a brief 'die-in,' sprawling on the floor of the crowded showroom as shoppers and employees watched. Many also blocked the FDR Drive, one of the main arteries around the city. 'The protests remained very peaceful throughout the night,' said Detective Michael DeBonis, a spokesman for the New York Police Department. It was a brief departure from the peaceful rallies of the previous two night and the group left without incident after about five minutes. Similar demonstrations were staged at Macy's flagship department store in Herald Square and at Grand Central Terminal, one of the city's two main rail stations. Police stood by but allowed the protesters to briefly occupy both locations. Some stores in midtown Manhattan shut early in response to the recent unrest. Representatives of Best Buy Co Inc and Target Corp said the companies had temporarily closed stores early as a precaution. Meanwhile, nearly 100 people, including local civic leaders, huddled under umbrellas near the site of Garner's death for a candlelight vigil on Staten Island. 'This is a movement, a rainbow of people,' the Rev. Demetrius Carolina of the First Central Baptist Church told the racially mixed crowd. Some stores in New York's Manhattan closed early as hundreds swarmed through the rain-soaked streets . Die-ins were staged in Apple and Macy's as the family of shot black man Akai Gurley staged his funeral . The Staten Island grand jury's decision came amid a wave of anger over similar cases across the US . Surrounding the Christmas tree in Bryant Park, Manhattan, protesters staged another die-in, holding signs . In Chicago, protesters paused for a moment of silence, as a siren could be heard wailing nearby. Renee Alexander, 44, a nurse from Woodbridge, Virginia, who joined about 200 protesters in downtown Washington, expressed outrage over the images of Garner's death, captured in the video widely shown on television and the Internet. 'It's heartbreaking for me to watch, over and over on TV, how his life was cut short on the street, just like a dog,' she said. 'They had no respect for him. No human being should die in the street like that - choked to death.' Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said on Friday he will convene a grand jury to consider charges against the New York City officer who shot Gurley. Police there have said the officer, Peter Liang, may have accidentally discharged his gun. At a news conference with Gurley's relatives on Friday, Kevin Powell, the president of the advocacy group BK Nation, called the shooting part of a 'series of modern-day lynchings.' Gurley's mother, Sylvia Palmer, tearfully demanded justice for her son. A wake for Gurley was scheduled for Friday night, with his funeral to follow on Saturday. Elsewhere: Meanwhile, demonstrators marched in front of the national guard in Ferguson, Missouri . Solidarity: Demonstrations were also held in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on Friday in memory of Eric Garner . People lay on the ground of the University of Michigan Law Library in support of the national movement . In Cleveland on Friday, the family of a 12-year-old boy fatally shot by police filed a lawsuit against the city, a day after the federal government found the police department systematically uses excessive force. New York police have taken a soft approach to crowd control during this week's protests, generally allowing marchers to proceed unhindered as long as they remained peaceful. Halfway across the country, activists on Friday concluded a 120-mile protest march to the Missouri governor's mansion from Ferguson, where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot to death in August by a policeman who initially stopped the teenager for walking in the street. Some witnesses to the confrontation told a grand jury that Brown had raised his hands in the air before he was killed, though others contradicted that testimony. More than 100 protesters shouted, 'hands up, don't shoot' and other slogans as they rallied in the rotunda of the state capitol in Jefferson City. Mourning: The family of Akai Gurley, who was shot dead by a cop on patrol last month, mourn at his wake . Tragic: Gurley, 28, was killed as he left his girlfriend's apartment block in Brooklyn where the cop patrolled . Tears: Members of his family embrace in the pews at Brown Memorial Baptist Church in New York on Friday . Unlike the August 9 slaying of Brown, Garner's encounter was captured on video. Pantaleo could still face disciplinary action from an internal police investigation, his lawyer said. Chokeholds are banned by police department regulations. Pantaleo told the grand jury he used a proper takedown technique and denied putting pressure on Garner's neck, according to his lawyer, Stuart London. The city's medical examiner has said Garner's death was caused by compressing his neck and chest, with his asthma and obesity contributing. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said the Justice Department will pursue civil rights investigations into both the Missouri shooting and the New York case, though legal experts have said federal charges for the two officers are unlikely.","More than one hundred demonstrators staged 'die-in' in Apple store .

"Asking this judge to walk the line proved to be something of a challenge, but the case against the justice from South Texas who was charged with drunk driving, has been dismissed despite video showing her stumbling after being pulled over by police. Hidalgo County officials said there was not enough evidence to prosecute 13th Court of Appeals Justice Nora Longoria who is 49, however the video showing her making a mess of a simple test for drunkenness was only released after the charges were dropped. She was stopped for a traffic violation in July and charged with misdemeanor driving while intoxicated. Scroll down for video . She walks the line: A month after a Texas court threw out a DUI case against a judge because it lacked strong evidence, police released dashcam video of her arrest that showed her stumble through a sobriety test . It's a fine line: The new video, recorded during a July traffic stop in McAllen, showed Nora Longoria struggling to walk a straight line. She teetered and lost her balance several times . Reports state Longoria ""had trouble with her balance and swayed from side to side and displayed red, glossy eyes,"" A fellow Judge, Rolando Cantu, dismissed the case against her last week. Now McAllen police have released dashcam video that led to her DWI arrest. The video is evidence Hidalgo County DA Rene Guerra said they never got. Judged: After being taken to the police station where she continued to be difficult with police, she finally admitted to drinking five beers earlier in the evening. Longoria later posted $2,000 bond and was released from custody . Police said the footage is crucial evidence that could have been used to prosecute Longoria. The footage shows she struggled to walk a straight line, and even stumbled several times during the test. The arresting officer said during sobriety tests, Longoria complained the officer was ""ruining her life and career for what he was doing."" She also reportedly said, ""I worked hard for 25 years to be where I'm at today."" Longoria failed the sobriety tests and then became emotional and ""refused to be handcuffed,"" authorities say. The police officer who stopped Logoria for driving 69 mph in a 55 mph zone said she begged him not to arrest her . Police say she refused to let officers handcuff her or to provide breath and blood tests. They say Longoria told officers they would have to drag her to the patrol car. After being taken to the police station where she continued to be difficult with police, she finally admitted to drinking five beers earlier in the evening. Longoria later posted $2,000 bond and was released from custody. District Attorney Rene Guerra tells the McAllen Monitor that Longoria didn't appear to have slurred speech in a recording at the jail. There isn’t a recording of the traffic stop. Longoria is represented by Democratic state Sen. Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa of McAllen.

"The European Tour is beginning a search for just the fourth chief executive in its history after the announcement that George O'Grady will step down. O'Grady, who has been with the Tour for more than 40 years, confirmed on Wednesday that he has asked the board of directors to begin the process to appoint his successor. The 65-year-old, who will remain in his role until that successor is found, became chief executive on January 1, 2005, succeeding John Jacobs - who led the Tour's formative years from 1971 to 1974 - and Ken Schofield, who took over on January 1, 1975. George O'Grady will step down as chief executive of the European Tour once successor is found . O'Grady (centre, in dark blue spotted jumper) stands with European and US players before the 2014 Ryder Cup . In a statement released by the European Tour, O'Grady said: ""In the aftermath of what I believe to have been the best presented Ryder Cup since my first involvement in the contest at Royal Lytham in 1977, I felt this was the right time to ask the board to begin the search for my successor. ""It is my firm belief that, coming towards the end of what has been another incredibly successful season, we are now seeing the green shoots of recovery across Europe and I am pleased that this coincides with all our building blocks, in terms of key television and sponsorship contracts, being in place. ""I have agreed with the board to stay not only for the time it takes to appoint a new CEO but also for sufficient additional time after that to see them properly settled in. The board also agreed that, at that stage, I will take up a role as president of international relations which will see me represent the European Tour through the Olympic Games in 2016."" US legend Jack Nicklaus (right) was given a Honorary Life Membership of the European Tour by O'Grady .

""The European Tour and its players are admired throughout the world of golf and George has played a key part in building global relationships and developing the Tour. He has always respected the traditions of the tour and built on the strong foundations put in place by John Jacobs, Neil Coles and Ken Schofield. ""The Tour is now embarking on a new phase in its development and that is why George has considered that it is the right time to ask the nominations committee to find his successor.""

"Manchester City's Champions League hopes suffered a potentially devastating blow after Sergio Aguero limped out of the win over Everton in tears with a knee injury. The Premier League's 14-goal top scorer was hurt after just 75 seconds of the match at the Etihad when Aguero appeared to jar his left knee following a tackle by Muhamed Besic moments after he had picked himself up from another challenge by Seamus Coleman. The Argentina striker is now a major doubt for City's potential Group E decider away to Roma on Wednesday night with Manuel Pellegrini's side needing a positive result in the Stadio Olimpico to stand any chance of reaching the knockout stage of the Champions League. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats . Sergio Aguero grimaces as he leaves the field in tears before being replaced . Aguero limps of with tears in his eyes after injuring his leg against Everton . Aguero was unable to continue and limped straight down the tunnel clutching his knee . Aguero has been in the form of his life with 19 goals in 20 games in all competitions this season – including the dramatic late hat-trick against Bayern Munich last month that revived City's hopes of qualification – and losing him would be a huge setback to the Premier League champions. The striker's tears as he limped forlornly around the outside of the pitch on Saturday, aided by a member of City's medical team, did not bode well, and Pellegrini is not expecting Aguero to be available for Wednesday showdown. 'Probably he will miss the game,' Pellegrini told Sky Sports.'If you have a problem in the ligament it is difficult to recover in three days.' If Aguero is indeed out City must go to Rome and prove they are not a one-man team – something Pellegrini disputed in his match programme notes on Saturday following the striker's two-goal display at Sunderland in midweek. Aguero clutches his knee in pain after going down just in the second minute of the Premier League match . 'Sergio of course gets a lot of the headlines and right now it's difficult for defences to stop him,' wrote Pellegrini. 'He is also working hard to improve, too. 'The team is not just about Sergio. We have excellent players all over the pitch. He is a very good player but it was the team that dominated the game. All the players had a high performance.' With Stevan Jovetic rested as a precaution on Saturday and Edin Dzeko returning on the bench after a month out with a calf injury, Pellegrini replaced Aguero with youngster Jose Angel Pozo for only his second Premier League appearance. But Aguero's injury has once again raised questions over the wisdom of City letting Alvaro Negredo join Valencia on loan in the summer without signing a replacement.

"Graeme McDowell was left to rue a poor finish despite setting the clubhouse target in the first round of the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai on Thursday. McDowell played his first 12 holes in seven under par at Sheshan International but dropped two shots in the last six to card an opening 67 in the second event of the European Tour's Final Series. Starting from the 10th, the Ryder Cup star birdied his opening hole and picked up further shots on the 13th, 14th, 16th and 17th to race to the turn in 31, before birdies at the second and third took him well clear of a star-studded field featuring 40 of the world's top 50. Former US Open winner Graeme McDowell set the clubhouse target in the first round of the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai but could have been further ahead but for a poor back nine . McDowell takes a 'selfie' with three local fans as he competes in Shanghai . Ulsterman McDowell talks to caddie Ken Comboy on the fifth hole and the Sheshan International Golf Club . However, the former US Open champion dropped his first shot of the day on the fourth and paid the price for missing his only fairway of the round on the 603-yard eighth hole, a par-five which had so far given up just two birdies. At five under par, McDowell enjoyed a two-shot lead over Ryder Cup opponent Rickie Fowler and fellow American Chris Kirk, who were approaching the end of their rounds, with Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter safely in the clubhouse on two under. American Dustin Johnson claimed the title 12 months ago with a winning total of 24 under par, but Justin Rose - who was fifth last year - had correctly predicted heavier rough and firmer greens would make scoring more difficult. Rickie Fowler receives support from local fans as he tees off on the 15th hole in Shanghai . Lee Westwood in action completed a two under round on the opening day of the event in Shanghai . Ian Poulter watches his shot after teeing off on the fourth hole during the first round . Rose, who was fourth in the BMW Masters on Sunday, was level par after 13 holes, while the winner at Lake Malaren - Germany's Marcel Siem - was one over with three to play. Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez, who took 13 on the ninth hole during his final round last week, struggled to an opening 78, while FedEx Cup winner Billy Horschel managed just one birdie in a round of 80. Fowler and Kirk duly completed rounds of 69 and were soon joined on three under by the likes of Brandt Snedeker, Tim Clark, 2011 winner Martin Kaymer and England's Tommy Fleetwood. Henrik Stenson looked set to expand that group still further but twice found sand on the ninth - his final hole - and almost thinned his third shot across the green and into the water. The resulting bogey left Stenson alongside Westwood and Poulter on two under, with world number two Adam Scott also completing an opening round of 70.","Graeme McDowell set the clubhouse target in first round of Shanghai event .

"Ryder Cup star Patrick Reed has apologised for an ‘unacceptable’ foul-mouthed outburst on the opening day of the WGC-HSBC Champions Event in Shanghai, but is still set to be punished by the PGA Tour. Reed finished four off the pace at Sheshan International after a round of 71, but the American faces a hefty fine after being caught on camera swearing and using language which could be interpreted as homophobic. Television commentators apologised after Reed was heard saying to himself, ‘Nice f****** three-putt you f****** f****t,’ after he bogeyed the first hole, having started on the ninth.

The 24-year-old apologised on Twitter later in the day, writing: ‘I’m sorry for using offensive language today in China. My passion to play well got the best of me and my word choice was unacceptable.’ A PGA Tour spokesman said: ‘The PGA Tour’s regulations prohibit the use of obscene language on the golf course. The PGA Tour will deal with this matter internally in accordance with its regulations.’ Reed’s playing partner Graeme McDowell finished with a two-shot lead in Shanghai after a five-under-par 67. The Irishman had a blistering start, and was seven under after 12 holes. He then failed to get up and down from a bunker on the fourth and paid the price for what he called ‘a comedy of errors’ on the par-five eighth, where he missed his only fairway of the day and also pulled his approach left of the green. Graeme McDowell (above) leads the event in Shanghai after round one with a five-under 67 . ‘A key to this golf course is driving the ball well,’ McDowell said, ‘and I only missed one fairway. The greens are in fantastic shape and I putted very well. ‘Seven under par through 12 was a beautiful start. I dropped a couple coming in, but all in all I am very, very pleased with five under par on what was a reasonably tricky day.’ McDowell believes he is well placed to take advantage of the lucrative events at the end of the season. ‘This has always been a part of the season I’ve enjoyed,’ the 35-year-old said. ‘I take three or four weeks off around the Ryder Cup and prepare myself for this and I’ve normally played well.’ Martin Kaymer’s 69 was matched by England’s Tommy Fleetwood.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists his players have to step up in the absence of captain Steven Gerrard after a frustrating goalless draw at home to Sunderland. With a must-win match at home to Basle in the Champions League on Tuesday, followed by a trip to Old Trafford, the 34-year-old midfielder was left on the bench until 23 minutes from the end.

His talent is world-class but that contribution has to come around the team,' he said. 'It can't be up to him every single game to be the catalyst. 'It is very hard to replace that quality but going forward that is something of course we will need. 'He was excellent when he came on and of course he plays on Tuesday. 'He still has that talent, he has world-class ability and it is me looking to manage that. 'We have a big month. Until the new year there are big games and the management of Steven is fine, there is no problem with that.'

Gerrard (right) came on in the 67th minute as Rodgers' side pushed for a goal against the Black Cats . Only Aston Villa and Burnley have scored fewer goals at home than Liverpool's seven and Rodgers' decision to leave Fabio Borini out of the squad - meaning he had no striker on the bench - was questioned. The Italian enjoyed a good loan spell at Sunderland last season and almost joined them in the summer after Liverpool agreed a deal to sell him. 'That is a decision I make as a manager,' said Rodgers when asked about the forward's absence.

I am trying to concentrate on what we have got.' What they had was good enough to keep their hosts at bay, having been beaten 4-1 by Manchester City in midweek.

"Andy Gray is on BT Sport’s shortlist to be co-commentator when their Champions League coverage starts next season. Gray, who is working for beIN Sport, based in Doha, made two guest appearances in that role during BT’s FA Cup broadcasts last season and would jump at the chance to return to mainstream English TV on a regular basis. BT, who need to augment their football talent before taking up exclusive live UK rights for the Champions League, are expected to finalise their plans in January. Andy Gray (left) works for beIN Sport but may return to Champions League football with BT Sport next season . Michael Owen missed Newcastle v Liverpool on Sunday to travel to America instead .

But after the storm over sexist comments about female assistant referee Sian Massey that led to his departure from Sky Sports in 2011, Gray’s appointment would have to be approved by BT Sport’s new chief Delia Bushell. A women’s campaign group criticised BT for using Gray in the FA Cup. However, it might be more than coincidental that news of a BT move for Gray has emerged after Michael Owen chose to watch his horse Brown Panther run in the Breeders’ Cup meeting in the States rather than work on BT Sport’s Newcastle v Liverpool match last Saturday. BT are understood to have been disappointed by Owen’s decision to put his racing interests before his football commitments and have made that very clear to him. So much so that if Owen misses another game in similar circumstances, there could be a parting of the ways.","Gray on shortlist to be co-commentator for BT Sport's Champions League coverage next season .

"Boxer Vido Loncar has been banned for life for viciously attacking a referee after losing his fight at the European Youth Boxing Championships in Croatia. The referee, having given Loncar a standing count, stopped the fight but, as he was preparing to announce the result, was attacked by the 18 year old. Incredibly, the Croatian boxing director defended his fighter's conduct. Vido Loncar punches the referee at the start of his brutal attack on the official after losing his fight in Croatia . 'I believe that he is not a butcher or as bad as this act makes him look,' said Zeljko Mavrovic. 'This was part of his excessive ambition in that moment.' Lithuanian Baniulis, who was awarded the victory, quickly fled the scene as spectators seemed stunned by the despicable attack. Loncar’s coach failed to intervene as the attack ensued, before the Croatian was dragged from the ring by his feet by security guards. Fortunately the Polish referee was then helped to his feet and received medical attention in hospital as Loncar was led away in shame.

"The lawyer representing one of four former Vanderbilt University football players charged in a June 2013 campus rape, says his client was 'too drunk to rape' or be held responsible for his actions. Vanderbilt tight end Brandon Vandenburg, safety Cory Batey, defensive Brandon Banks, and receiver Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie were suspended and indicted in September 2013 for allegedly raping a 21-year-old female student and videotaping the assault. But now Vandenburg's defense attorney says her client was too drunk to know what he was doing and would not have been able to perform such a sex act, the Tennessean reports. Defense attorney for Brandon Vandenburg (pictured) charged with raping a woman in a campus dorm in June 2013 has said he was so drunk that he was incapable of rape . Date night: On June 23, Brandon Vandenburg took a 21-year-year woman out on a date to the Tin Roof bar, after which she passed out . Nashville prosecutors says the theory is far-fetched and wants to put a stop to the alibi before it goes any further. A new court filing asks a judge to block a Los Angeles-based psychologist from testifying about Vandenburg's drunkenness on the night police say he took part in the rape of his unconscious 21-year-old girlfriend in his dorm room. The psychologist's report suggests that the idea Vandenburg was so drunk as to be unaware of his surroundings but prosecutors say such an idea is 'purely speculative' and not based on science. Although the judge in the case has not ruled on whether to allow the 'evidence' during the forthcoming trial, it is unlikely that drunkenness would be allowed to serve as an excuse for committing a crime. 'Intoxication is generally not a defense to prosecution of a crime, particularly when the defendant was 'voluntarily' intoxicated,' said David Veile, a Franklin criminal defense attorney and continuing legal education instructor to the Tennessean. Veile said intoxication wouldn't help Vandenburg clear himself of recklessness, which is one of several factors in prosecuting aggravated rape. Crime scene: Police say the star player brought his unconscious date to his second-floor room in the Gillette House dormitory, where he proceeded to rape her but his defense lawyer said he was far too drunk to do it . Freed: Brandon Vandenburg was released from jail this in September 2013 k on $350,000 bond . '(Defendants) cannot later claim that they were 'so drunk' that they were unaware of a substantial risk,' he said. The psychologist's report also provides a new account of what happened when Vandenburg and the woman arrived at Gillette Hall after authorities said they were drinking at The Tin Roof bar. According to CCTV video, a 'very intoxicated' Vandenburg drove the woman's black Mercedes through an intersection without stopping and parked near a police vehicle. Vandenburg bumped the woman's head on the car door before seeking help from three other men to take her inside. He also hit his own head on an elevator and vomited in a bathroom, 'intoxicated to the extent that he could not have possessed the required culpable mental state to form intent to be held criminally responsible for the actions of the others that were in his room,' wrote psychologist Stefanie Stolinsky. The defense also wants to prevent the victim from testifying at trial. During the attack, Vandenburg sent a picture to another player, Chris Boyd, which he deleted, prosecutors have said. Boyd received an 11-month, 29-day suspended sentence after pleading guilty to criminal attempt to commit accessory after the fact. Prosecutors say he attempted to cover up the rape. Afterward, Boyd sent a text to Vandenburg saying he and the other players who had been there should delete the photos and videos they had taken. Boyd said he was looking out for their interests . According to an account given at a different hearing, Deputy Attorney General Tom Thurman said Vandenburg took an unconscious fellow student to his dormitory in the early morning of June 23, 2013. Earlier appearance: The alleged rape is believed to have taken place in Vandenburg's room, and the victim did not think he would have allowed anything bad to happen to her (Vandenburg seen here in October last year) Cory Batey (left), Brandon Banks (center) and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie (right) are the other players facing two counts each of aggravated sexual battery in connection to the June 2013 rape . He was joined by three other dismissed players — Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian ""Tip"" McKenzie. The student was sexually assaulted ""by different individuals,"" Thurman had said. All four are charged with several counts of rape and have pleaded not guilty. They are free on bond. Banks and McKenzie face separate trials. The case has become cantankerous with the defense and prosecution trading allegations of misconduct against one another. The trial begins for Vandenburg and Batey on November 3rd. Two other defendants, Brandon Banks and Jaborian Mckenzie, have their own separate their trials to come.","Authorities say suspect Brandon Vandenburg took 21-year-old to a bar June 23 and then brought her unconscious to his door room .

"Manchester City cut the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea to three points but it came at a huge cost with star striker Sergio Aguero limping off in tears after sustaining a potentially-serious knee injury near the start of the game. Aguero received sympathetic applause from stunned City fans as he sadly made his way around the edge of the pitch to the dressing-room after receiving nearly five minutes of treatment. His eyes were clearly watery both because of the pain and also the prospect of missing Wednesday night's vital Champions League clash away to Roma that will help define City's season.

CLICK HERE for all the stats and heat maps from the Etihad Stadium including Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri's in a man-of-the-match display (above) Though City rallied to win the game with a hotly-disputed Yaya Toure penalty midway through the first half, manager Manuel Pellegrini and the club's supporters will be this morning be hugely concerned by the injury to their 19-goal striker, particularly with the club needing a result in Italy to progress to the last 16 in Europe. They were without captain Vincent Kompany, David Silva and Stevan Jovetic on Saturday while Edin Dzeko had his first 30 minutes action for a month following a calf injury. Yaya Toure is also suspended for another two Champions League matches. Pellegrini confirmed: 'Sergio has a problem with his ligament in his knee. It is impossible to know now how long he will be out for but we may know on Sunday. But probably he will miss the game with Roma, it is very difficult to recover from a ligament problem in three days.' Everton's Kevin Mirallas fires his free-kick over the wall - and over the bar - as he tries to get Everton back in the game . Seamus Coleman looks to beat Gael Clichy as Everton go in search of an equalizer . Aguero, who had scored a hat-trick on his previous appearance at The Etihad against Bayern Munich, suffered his injury as he was caught by Everton midfielder Muhamed Besic while clambering to his feet at an awkward angle after being clattered from behind by Seamus Coleman. There were just 75 seconds on the clock. The 26-year-old is not noted for histrionics so as he lay on the pitch in clear agony disconsolately clutching his left knee, you knew it was serious enough for him to have to depart the action. Mindful that Aguero's natural replacement Edin Dzeko hadn't himself played since November 8 because of a calf injury, Pellegrini instead sent on 18-year-old Jose Pozo for his third appearance as a substitute in City's first-team, saving the Bosnian for the last half-hour.

Given all the injury problems, Pellegrini was delighted with his side's fighting spirit that helped them take advantage of leaders Chelsea's slip-up at Newcastle earlier in the day. 'It is not easy to beat a team like Everton when you have so many important players not there,' he said. The visitors would counter that the champions also received a big helping hand from referee Andre Marriner. Everton manager Roberto Martinez thought two City players Eliaquim Mangala and Fernando should both have been sent off for high boots, Mangala catching Samuel Eto'o in the back with a kung-fu style kick and Fernando making contact with Gareth Barry's head. He was also fuming at the key penalty decision after 24 minutes when James Milner tumbled as Phil Jagielka ran across which was ruled a deliberate barge by Mr Marriner but a legitimate shoulder-to-shoulder challenge by Martinez. 'It is part of the game, Milner was not even asking for a penalty. To say I am disappointed is an understatement,' said Martinez. The visitors surrounded Mr Marriner but City's captain-for-the day Toure struck the ball cleanly past Tim Howard even though the Everton 'keeper correctly dived to his right. From then onwards, it was sheer guts and determination that saw City through. James Milner has a shot on goal as City looked to extend their lead over Everton .

'Chelsea lost their game so it was important to recover points. To be near the leaders. 'This is a difficult month where we have to play seven games in the Premier League. You can't win the title in December but it is a key month so you can start the new year close to the leader.'

But there were jitters towards the end as mid-table Everton had a late rally. Their best opening arrived after 82 minutes and Romelu Lukaku couldn't believe that Joe Hart – who is close to signing a new four-and-a-half-year contract at City – stuck out a strong left hand to his shot and tipped the ball away. Milner was left dazed in injury-time after getting caught across the back of the head by a flailing elbow from the already-booked Barry, whose next caution will make him the first Premier League player to receive a hundred yellow cards. And there was rancour from home fans towards Everton sub Ross Barkley – ironically a City target - for another theatrical fall. But depleted City somehow held on. For Pellegrini now, the most immediate priority is Europe. But in Premier League terms the Chelsea v Manchester City fixture on January 31, the final weekend of the transfer window as well, is already looking very tasty.

"A Florida mom convicted of cooking her neighbor after stabbing, strangling and dismembering him following an apparent money has been sentenced to life in prison. Angela Stoldt, 42, will now die behind behind bars after being sentenced in Volusia County on Friday, but showed no remorse as the decision was handed down. Authorities say Stoldt tried to cremate 36-year-old James Sheaffer's body in April 2013 by putting several body parts in an oven and in pots on the stove, including a foot, a leg and both arms. When that didn't work, she put his body parts in bags and had her teenage children help her scatter them in different places near their home in Deltona, telling them she was trying to dispose of a deer she had hit with the car. Life in prison: Angela Stoldt, 42, of Deltona, showed no remorse in court Friday as she was sentenced to life for murdering, dismembering and disposing neighbor James Sheaffer, 36, following a dispute about money . Gruesome murder: Angela Stoldt, 42 (left), stabbed neighbor James Sheaffer, 36 (right), with an ice pick, strangled him and then tried to dispose of his body by hacking it to pieces and cooking the remains . Crime scene: Stoldt got into an argument with Sheaffer while sitting in her car at the Osteen Cemetery in Deltona in April 2013 . The prosecution say Stoldt drugged her neighbor Sheaffer before driving him to Osteen Cemetery in Deltona, stabbing him in both eyes with an ice pick, and choking him with a cord. In September, Stold's attorney filed a motion claiming self defense under Florida's controversial 'stand your ground' law, but Judge Randell Rowe III rejected the motion. Court documents obtained by Daytona News-Journal previously showed Sheaffer, a married father of three, had asked Stoldt to act as the payee on his Social Security disability benefits, but he kept overdrawing their joint account. He also wanted Stoldt to ask her father for a $4,000 loan. Stoldt relied on their financial relationship for money, but the two were platonic. On the morning of April 3, 2013, Stoldt, with her two children in tow, picked up her neighbor from his work at Blue Diamond Limousines and drove to her home on Horseshoe Terrace, where the two drank vodka and peach schnapps cocktails. But according to court filings, the mother of two spiked her neighbor's beverage with a prescription pain medication, which she had stolen from her father knowing that it causes drowsiness, especially when mixed with alcohol. Stoldt then allegedly loaded the drugged man into her car and drove to the Osteen Cemetery after dropping the kids off at her parents'. Husband and father: Sheaffer, who was married with three kids, was stabbed in the eye and then strangled; police were never able to locate all of his remains . While Stoldt had previously claimed Sheaffer 'came at her and said that he was going to kill Ms. Stoldt as well as her children', according to her strand-your-ground, Prosecutor Ryan Will told the jury she had planned to kill Sheaffer all along. She reached to the backseat for the ice pick and stabbed Sheaffer in the right eye. She then grabbed a cord with two handles and used it to strangle Sheaffer by wrapping it tightly around his neck, Will said. After the man stopped moving, the mother grabbed the ice pick again and drove it through Sheaffer's left eye. She then wrapped the man's head in Saran Wrap to keep him from bleeding all over the car interior. The News-Journal reported that Stoldt had bought the plastic, as well as rubber gloves, from Wal-Mart just hours before the killing. She then drove home, with Sheaffer's corpse propped up in the passenger seat, the ice pick still protruding from his face. Will said Stoldt then drove to her home and parked in the garage, where she cut up Sheaffer's body using a knife and a saw. She then moved the body parts one by one into her kitchen. Life and death situation: Stoldt's attorney filed a motion claiming that the woman was in fear for her life because Sheaffer was threatening to kill her and her two children . 'She took him into the house piece by piece. ... The very same house she shares with her two teenage children and she cooked him in her oven and stove. She started with the oven but when the smoke and smell became unbearable she realized that she might get caught,' Will told the court. Thats when Stoldt allegedly began boiling some parts on the stove. Sheaffer's head and torso were not found, testified Dr. Marie Herrmann, the medical examiner for Volusia County. However a soup pot was recovered that contained  Sheaffer's thigh bone, knee cap and some soft tissue, Hermann testified. Stoldt dumped other mutilated body parts in trash bags and disposed of them with the help of her teenage son, who was led to believe that they were getting rid of a deer his mother had killed with her car the night before. To cover up the murder, Miss Stoldt then buried her neighbor's cellphone and driver’s license in different parks, and got rid of the pots and pans used to boil human flesh. When Stoldt's daughter, who is now 16 years old, asked her about the foul smell lingering in the house, the 42-year-old woman initially lied that a rat had gotten trapped inside the oven. But she eventually came clean to the girl, telling her that she had drugged and killed James Sheaffer after he threatened to kill her. However, it was not until three weeks later that Angela Stoldt confessed to the rest of her family, prompting her sister to call 911 on April 21 because she was afraid the distraught, sleep-deprived woman might commit suicide. In the course of her questioning, Miss Stoldt spoke without hesitation of her attempts to dispose of her neighbor's corpse. 'Thursday is when I was cooking him. Friday is when I was dumping him,' she was quoted as saying. The woman showed little remorse for her actions, telling police she believed at the time Sheaffer was going to ruin her life. ‘I’m sorry, but I put Jimmie where he belonged, in my opinion at the time,’ she told detectives. Ms Stoldt eventually led sheriff's deputies to various locations around Volusia County to help recover James Sheaffer's remains, but officials said they were never able to locate all of Sheaffer's body parts. Confrontation: Sheaffer, a limo driver, allegedly attacked Stoldt while sitting in her car and would not let go of her until she wrapped a cord around his neck . Investigators who canvassed Sheaffer’s Deltona neighborhood looking for the missing man before Stoldt’s confession had talked to the woman on more than one occasion. She acknowledged being friends with Sheaffer and said she handled some of his financial affairs for him. She told investigators that she last saw Sheaffer on April 5 and 15, even though family members hadn’t seen him since April 2. The investigation took a turn April 20 when Stoldt’s sister called 911 saying that the mother of two was acting suicidal and had admitted to killing James Sheaffer. The caller told the Sheriff’s office that Stoldt was hugging her children and saying goodbye. ‘Why’s she hugging her kids goodbye?’ the emergency dispatcher asked. ‘Because she came to the house and she told my parents that she committed a crime and that she’s being investigated for it,’ the woman’s sister replied. Ms Stoldt initially declined to talk to investigators and was taken in for a mental health evaluation. But officials were able to obtain a search warrant to enter her house, where they came upon evidence indicating a crime had been committed there. A short time later, Angela Stoldt confessed to stabbing and strangling Sheaffer, and then disposing of his body. Stoldt then led investigators to a location where human remains were recovered. Ms Stoldt is being held without bail.","Angela Stoldt, 42, confessed to killing limo driver James Sheaffer, 36, in April 2013 by stabbing him in the face and strangling him with a cord .

"Children are curious souls - and this one was no exception during an encounter with Pope Francis. As the pontiff held the youngster in his arms while visiting a medical centre yesterday, the cheeky child took off his white zucchetto, or skullcap, at the Vatican. For a moment, it looked like the cap-snatcher had an amazing souvenir - but, with a smile, the leader of the Catholic Church retrieved his headwear and returned it to its rightful place. Scroll down for video . What's this white thing on his head? Pope Francis held a child in his arms while visiting the Santa Marta Vatican Institute yesterday . Oh look, it comes off: The child begins to remove the pontiff's zucchetto, or skullcap, during the Pope's tour of the paediatric centre . The 'People's Pope' smiled as the youngster played with his headwear . The papal cap was soon put back in its rightful place . For more than 90 years, the centre on the Vatican grounds has been distributing milk, clothing, nappies, toys and even baby carriages to families in need . It was the second time that day that the Pope had a surprise. Earlier, he had received a candle-topped cake from the children, three days ahead of his 77th birthday. He was presented with the treat after touring the Santa Marta Institute, which provides paediatric care. For more than 90 years, the centre on the Vatican grounds has been distributing milk, clothing, nappies, toys and even baby carriages to families in need. Francis blew out the candles, thanked the youngsters for the cake and promised: 'I'll tell you later if it's good or not.' Pope Francis waves at the end of an audience with beneficiaries and volunteers of the Santa Marta paediatric dispensary . It was the second time that day that the Pope had a surprise. Earlier, he had received a candle-topped cake from the children, three days ahead of his 77th birthday . On Wednesday, Pope Francis was named 2013 Person of the Year by Time magazine - edging out NSA whistleblower and fugitive Edward Snowden into second place. Nancy Gibbs, the magazine's editor, said: 'So much of what he has done in the brief nine months in this office changed the tone of what’s coming out of the Vatican.' Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that 'the Holy Father is not looking to become famous or to receive honours. 'But if the choice of Person of Year helps spread the message of the gospel - a message of God's love for everyone - he will certainly be happy about that.'

The pontiff kissed and prayed with the ailing man who was battling neurofibromatosis - the rare disease said to have affected the Elephant Man. Patients suffering from the ailment, which is genetic and not contagious, are often shunned by society because of their appearance. Pope Francis has been widely praised for his common touch and accessibility. Since being elected to the Holy See earlier this year, he has made headlines around the world by washing the feet of juvenile delinquents, personally calling distraught worshippers on the phone and inviting homeless people to dine at St Peter's Square.","Pope Francis visited Santa Marta medical centre on grounds of Vatican .

"Brendan Rodgers sent a reserve team into the lion's den as he made seven changes to the Liverpool starting line-up for the Champions League match at the Bernabeu. There was no Steven Gerrard, no Raheem Sterling and no Jordan Henderson in the starting XI against Real Madrid on Tuesday. In their place were Lucas Leiva, Emre Can and Fabio Borini - hardly renowned as stalwarts of Liverpool's first-choice team so far this season. In some quarters, Rodgers' men have been described as 'brave', as 'plucky', as having 'given a good account of themselves'. Hard work and team ethic is a commendable attribute, but this is the Champions League - Europe's elite competition. Karim Benzema (left) loses his marker and sticks the ball in the back of the net from around a yard out . Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the team that started on the weekend against Newcastle . Benzema runs to the delighted home supporters after scoring the first goal of the night in the Bernabeu . Steven Gerrard (left) started the game on the bench and came on as a substitute for Lucas Leiva . 137 - The seven players on the Liverpool bench had made 137 Champions League appearances between them prior to kick-off last night. That’s seven more than the number made by the players in their starting XI. 130 - The number of Champions League appearances made by Liverpool’s starting XI. 642 - The number of Champions League appearances made by Real Madrid’s starting XI. £59 -The cost of an away ticket at Bernabeu on Wednesday. Not to mention the added cost of flights and hotels. 27 - Shots at goal by Madrid last night. That’s 13 more than they managed in their 3-0 win at Anfield. 2 - Minutes played by Steven Gerrard at the Bernabeu prior to Wednesday. He was a sub in a 1-0 win in 2009. He has now played a total of 23 minutes at the stadium. 3,669 - Tickets at the Bernabeu allocated to Liverpool fans. Rodgers’ team selection will have disappointed many who made the 1,796-mile round-trip. Unfortunately for Liverpool the statistics do not lie - and, on this occasion, they paint a bleak picture of a side who were never in the contest with Carlo Ancelotti's side. So let us run through these numbers. First up, shots on goal. Madrid's star-studded side managed 27 attempts on Simon Mignolet's goal, with nine of them finding the target - including Karim Benzema's strike which separated the sides. When Real destroyed Liverpool 3-0 at Anfield two weeks ago, they managed just 14 attempts on goal. The eight saves which Mignolet was forced to make ensured the Reds stopper made the most in a single game for Liverpool since the Reds faced Everton in November 2013 (on which occasion he saved nine times). Liverpool, on the other hand, managed a mere four attempts on goal. Not four on target, four shots in total with just a solitary effort from Alberto Moreno testing opposition keeper Iker Casillas. In the first half they had precisely zero efforts on goal, while Real had 13. What's worse, they have now failed to score in three successive Champions League game - the first time they have managed to do such a thing since September 2006. Well how about blocked shots then? Real were denied by Liverpool defenders on 12 occasions while the Reds forced the home side to block just one effort. Borini, Liverpool's sole striker, did not register a shot in the entire match while attacking midfielders Adam Lallana and Lazar Markovic managed just one between them. Conversely, Real's attacking trio of Benzema (two), Cristiano Ronaldo (six) and Isco (one) shared nine. Benzema himself has scored an impressive five goals in four Champions League appearances so far this season. His goal on Tuesday also ensured he has scored in four consecutive European matches for the first time since March 2011.

Liverpool's captain for the night Martin Skrtel walks off at half-time holding his head with his side 1-0 down . The view from behind the goal as Mignolet stretches and acrobatically denies Ronaldo (left) Brendan Rodgers decided to makes seven changes for Tuesday night's clash against Real Madrid. Only Simon Mignolet, Martin Skrtel, Alberto Moreno and Joe Allen survived from the 1-0 defeat to Newcastle at the weekend. Liverpool starting XI v Newcastle: . Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno, Sterling, Allen, Gerrard, Henderson, Coutinho, Balotelli . Liverpool starting XI v Real Madrid: . Mignolet, Manquillo, Toure, Skrtel , Moreno; Can, Lucas; Lallana, Allen, Markovic; Borini . So let's move on to possession. As the home side you would expect Real to shade it slightly, yet they kept the ball for 60.2 per cent of the match with Liverpool enjoying just 39.8 per cent possession. OK this statistic is not terrible, but the wastefulness and inept attacking ability of Rodgers' side when on the ball was clear for all to see. Cristiano Ronaldo, Toni Kroos, Rodrigeuz et al completed a staggering 711 passes with an accuracy of 90.9 per cent. Joe Allen, Lucas, Can and Co? Well they made just 479 passes with an accuracy of 86.6 per cent. Interestingly, for an away side deemed as 'plucky' and who expected to defend for long periods of the game, Liverpool won just 22 tackles to Real's 24. The home side's ratio of successful tackles was also higher as well (87.5 per cent to 72.7 per cent). - Karim Benzema has scored five goals in four Champions League appearances this season. - The French striker has scored in four consecutive CL games for the first time since March 2011. - In the first half, Liverpool failed to have an attempt of any kind. Real Madrid had 13 shots (including blocked). - Real Madrid finished the game with more shots on target (9) than Liverpool managed shots of any kind (4). - Liverpool's bench (137) had made more Champions League appearances than their starting XI (130) before Tuesday's match kicked off. - Simon Mignolet made eight saves against Real. The last time he made more in a single game for Liverpool was versus Everton in November 2013 (9). - Liverpool have failed to score in three successive CL games for the first time since September 2006. - Real Madrid have won 10 home Champions League games in a row.

The Reds boss applauds the travelling fans at full time after Liverpool's defeat by Real Madrid . Real also won more interceptions (21 to Liverpool's 15), had far more corners (seven to one), as well as destroying Liverpool in terms of the total number of crosses (23 to eight). The 3,669 Reds supporters present at the game paid £59 per ticket for the Bernabeu clash - not to mention the cost of travel and accommodation. They witnessed a starting XI with just 130 Champions League appearances between them - although there were 137 appearances sitting on the substitutes' bench - take on the current European champions, who had nearly five times that number on display. These statistics are a damning indictment of Rodgers' team selection. The scoreline may have been an extremely flattering 1-0, and his side may have defended admirably at times, but the Liverpool boss must surely have learned never to put out a reserve team in Europe's premier competition again.

"Living to the ripe old age of 500 might be a possibility if the science shown to extend worms' lives can be applied to humans, scientists have said. U.S. researchers tweaked two genetic pathways in the tiny lab worm Caenorhabditis elegans and boosted the creature's lifespan by a factor of five. The research raises the prospect of anti-ageing treatments based on genetic interactions, they said. U.S. scientists tweaked two genetic pathways in the tiny lab worm Caenorhabditis elegans (pictured) and boosted the creature's lifespan by a factor of five . ‘What we have here is a synergistic five-fold increase in lifespan,’ said lead scientist Dr Pankaj Kapahi, from the Buck Institute of Age Research, Novato, California. ‘The two mutations set off a positive feedback loop in specific tissues that amplified lifespan. ‘Basically these worms lived to the human equivalent of 400 to 500 years.’ Living to the age of 500 might be a possibility if the science shown to extend worms' lives can be applied to humans, scientists said. Two mutations set off a positive feedback loop in specific tissues that enabled worms to live to the human equivalent of 400 to 500 years . While it could take years of research to . extend humans’ lives dramatically, the study raises the prospect of . anti-ageing treatments informed by genetic interactions, according to Dr . Kapahi. ‘In the early years, cancer researchers focused on mutations in single genes, but then it became apparent that different mutations in a class of genes were driving the disease process,’ he said. While it could take years of research to extend humans' lives, the study raises the prospect of anti-ageing treatments informed by genetic interactions . ‘The same thing is likely happening in ageing,’ he added. C. elegans, the first animal to have its whole genome (or genetic code) mapped, has been widely used in studies of ageing and lifespan. The new research, reported in the journal Cell Reports, involved blocking key molecules that affect the action of insulin and a nutrient signalling pathway called Target of Rapamycin (TOR). Single mutations in the TOR pathway were known to extend the lifespan of C. elegans by 30 per cent, while insulin-signalling mutations could double the amount of time they lived. Adding the two together might have been expected to extend longevity by 130 per cent, but the combined impact turned out to be much greater. The research may explain why it has proved so difficult to identify single genes responsible for the long lives enjoyed by human centenarians. ‘It's quite probable that interactions between genes are critical in those fortunate enough to live very long, healthy lives,’ said Dr Kapahi. Future research is expected to use mice to see if the same effects occur in mammals. ‘The idea would be to use mice genetically engineered to have suppressed insulin signalling and then treat them with the drug rapamycin, which is well-known to suppress the TOR pathway,’ Dr Kapahi said. Earlier this year British scientists captured death spreading like a wave through the body of a worm, by studying the blue fluorescence that travels cell-to-cell until the whole organism is dead. Researchers from the Wellcome Trust and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) likened the spread of the blue glow travelling through the worm's body to that of the Grim Reaper, stalking death. They believe that the research could eventually prove to be a useful model to understanding death in people and perhaps even lead to an increase in life expectancy. When individual cells die, they trigger a chemical chain reaction that leads to the breakdown of cell components and a build-up of molecular debris. The molecular mechanisms of this are reasonably well understood at a cellular level but we know much less about how death spreads throughout an organism at the end of its life. In worms, the spread of death can be seen easily under a microscope as a wave of blue fluorescence travelling through the gut of the worm. The study, published in PLoS Biology, reveals that this fluorescence is caused by a cell death pathway called necrosis and its spread throughout the organism is dependent on calcium signalling.

"Janice Dickinson turned her attention on Bill Cosby's wife of 50 years, saying that she made a 'choice' to stay with the shamed comedian despite mounting rape allegations. Dickinson, 59, said she 'feels bad' for Camille Cosby, who has yet to speak out about the allegations and has silently supported her husband throughout the controversy. She brought up the entertainer's spouse, in a tearful CNN interview this week in which she revealed new, graphic details of a 1982 meeting in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, at which Cosby allegedly drugged and raped her. Scroll down for video . 'I feel bad for her': Janice Dickinson said she pities Camille Cosby, who has been married to bill Cosby, who allegedly raped Dickinson, for 50 years . Together: Camille, pictured above with Bill Cosby, has stood by her husband through the mounting scandal . Her words came as yet more women have stepped forward to say Cosby raped them. The mounting number of cases also prompted Dickinson to call on people in Hollywood who work with Cosby to boycott the comedian. In a segment of the interview first aired Saturday, Dickinson said: 'I feel bad for her. She knew that he was promiscuous. She stayed married to him. This is her choice, I can't speak for her. 'I can only say to Mrs Cosby that I am sorry I had sex with your husband and he had raped me. I'm sorry that he raped me. 'I'm sorry for you that your husband gave me wine and pills - with the sole intent of having sex with me and raping me. 'I'm sorry for her husband was a philanderer and is rapist, I really mean that, and for his children. 'Maybe Camille Crosby can say something to me about how I feel about what her husband did to me.' Accusations: Janice Dickinson spoke to CNN, detailing her allegations at length . Speaking to CNN anchor Fredricka Whitfield, she explained in detail her story of being lured out of rehab by an offer to appear on television with Cosby. She claimed he gave her wine and a pill, which caused her to black out. Dickinson then claimed that she remembers nothing until she woke up after the act covered in Cosby's semen, having been anally and vaginally raped. She said she left as quickly as possible and didn't speak out for decades through fear. In light of the mounting evidence she said that Hollywood should rally round her claims and not support him. She said: 'This man is not a family man that he played on TV, he's a rapist. I would hope that the other actors would get behind me on this.' She later expanded on what she thought the consequences for Cosby's career should be. In a separate interview with MSNBC's Ronan Farrow, she said the professional showbusiness world should abandon the comedian. She said: 'If anyone wants to hire this guy, you’re making a big mistake. 'Bill Cosby should not work anymore he should not be in front of an audience he should not have advertisers attached to [his projects]'. Dickinson also went into further detail about the night, including the moment Cosby started to rape her. Defiant: The above was Janice Dickinson's reaction when asked what she would like to say to Cosby's legal team, who have refuted her allegations . She said: 'I remember being absolutely horrified when I felt him get on top of me and start to grunt. 'I don’t remember any conversation and I remember feeling a lot of pain before I blacked out downstairs – in my vagina and I felt it in my anus. 'I remember in the morning waking up. [Memories are] coming up now because I’m sober – I’m sober today, I wasn't sober then.' Lawyers for Cosby have dismissed the allegations as a work of fantasy. Marty Singer, a Hollywood lawyer representing Cosby, said: 'There is a glaring contradiction between what she is claiming now for the first time and what she wrote in her own book and what she told the media back in 2002.' However, when confronted with the rebuttal, Dickinson was defiant and said she would keep repeating the allegation. She said: 'You will not be able to shut me up Marty Singer, you will not be able to shut me up pig Cosby. You will not be able to do this.' 'That’s too nice a word for you – you’re a snake. And you have no empathy, you have no compassion and you’re a bully, you’re a coward yourself and know that we are not liars.'","Dickinson, 59, has claimed Bill Cosby raped her in hotel room in 1982 .

"A baby boy born with four arms and four legs is causing panic in the streets of Baruipur, east India, as locals believe he is the reincarnation of a god. The child has been named God Boy, as multiple limbs are common among Hindu deities, and people are travelling from across the region to the city in West Bengal State to get a glimpse of the child. Local police complain they are struggling to control the crowds, as hundreds cry in the streets and clamor to get access to the hospital.

"Nearly half of Americans in key voting areas think race relations have gotten worse under the nation's first black president, a new poll shows. The survey, taken by Politico the last week of August and the first week of September, found that 46 percent of residents in states and House districts with competitive federal elections this fall believe that racial tension has increased under President Barack Obama's leadership. Just six percent of voters polled said they thought relations had improved under Obama. The survey's findings follow the high-profile death a black teen in Ferguson, Missouri, who was shot and killed by a white police office. Wrong kind of change: Nearly half of Americans think race relations are worse now than they were when President Barack Obama took office . Whites were more likely to believe that racial tensions had worsened under Obama than other races . African-American leaders from across the nation poured into the mostly black town and local residents staged protests for weeks after 18-year-old Michael Brown's killing. Two and a half years ago the death of another black teen, Trayvon Martin, put race relations front and center after it was revealed that the shooter, volunteer neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman, was Hispanic. It was white voters who were most likely to tell Politco's pollsters that the relationship between races had broken down during Obama's five and a half years in office, however. Among African Americans, 38 percent said they thought relations had worsened, compared to the 49 percent of whites who said the same thing. Hispanics were least likely to believe that Obama's tenure had brought about increased racial tension in America, with only 30 percent saying relations had gone south while 14 percent said they'd improved. Roughly the same number of African Americans, 13 percent, were optimistic about the state of race relations. A mere six percent of white voters agreed. The survey on the relationship between races was part of a pre-election poll that sought to take the temperature of voters in battleground districts. The remainder of Obama's presidency hangs in the balance as voters head to the polls in November to decide which political party will control the House of Representatives and which party will lead the Senate. Republicans are expected to maintain their stronghold in the House, and they have a ripe opportunity to pick off Senate Democrats in half a dozen states. It is critical for the president that this party does not lose its majority in the upper chamber and that it pulls off upsets in more than a dozen House races. Otherwise, Obama will have little to no ability to push forward his legislative agenda during his last two years in office. With less than 50 days to go until the mid-term elections, control of the legislative branch is still up for grabs, as voters remain divided over whether they want a Democrat or Republican to represent their interests in Congress. If dissatisfaction with the president is any indication of which way the political winds will blow, Democrats are in serious trouble. Obama continues to be underwater with voters on the issues they say concern them the most, including the economy and immigration. And even though a net majority of voters, 66 percent, claim to support comprehensive immigration reform, which the Republican Party mostly opposes, and 51 percent say they support a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, respondents to Politico's poll favored Republicans to handle immigration over Democrats by a slim margin, 34 percent to 31 percent. 'It’s not going to be a good year for Democrats by definition,' newly minted CNN contributor and former White House press secretary Jay Carney admitted yesterday on State of the Union. 'The sixth year is always particularly bad for a president’s party,' the former Obama flack said, according to Mediaite. 'You couple that with the fact so many seats are defended by Democrats in red states where Mitt Romney did very well against the president, double-digits in most cases, and there’s no outcome in November that anybody could say would be great for Democrats, except for barely holding onto the Senate,' he concluded.","White were more likely than any other race to say that relations had worsened under Barack Obama's leadership .

Now the virus has spread throughout more of the U.S. and also into Europe and Latin America: note the pattern on the left is regular, concentric and can be understood in terms of simple reaction-diffusion equations, while the pattern on the right gets more complex . The model relies on the concept of ‘effective distance,’ and the belief that contagion now travels much more quickly and effectively between busy airports in different countries than between cities and more rural areas in the same country. ‘In the modern world that’s so connected, old school, conventional geographic distance is not so meaningful anymore.’ Brockmann told Fast Company. He and his colleagues have spent the past decade testing how ‘effective distance’ might work by building theoretical pandemics and models that predict their theoretical spread. Three-years-worth of airline data was analyzed to see how these distances interact with the aim of developing a universal equation that would account for the arrival times of any disease across the globe. As the outbreak continues to impact different parts of the world the pattern on the left remains regular - similar to waves created by dropping a stone in water . Dirk Brockmann have found that contagion now travels much more quickly and effectively between busy airports in different countries rather than between cities and more rural areas in the same country . Brockmann has discovered that the jumbled, erratic spread of disease, right, can be reduced to simple, constant wave patterns, left, riding on effective distances, rather than geographic ones, through a 'global mobility network' Brockmann and his co-author Dirk Hebling published a paper in Science today, which shows that the jumbled, erratic spread of disease can be reduced to simple, constant wave patterns, riding on effective distances, rather than geographic ones, through a ‘global mobility network.’ When Brockmann plotted the SARS and H1N1 epidemics’ actual arrival times in different cities against their effective distances, he found strong positive correlations. ‘So we don’t need to know anything about the disease,’ Brockmann explained. ‘If you throw a rock into the water, you’ll see a concentric wave. If you throw a big rock into the water, you will also see a concentric wave. If you throw a rock into honey, or some different liquid, you will see a wave that is propagating slower, but it will still be a concentric wave.’ Regardless of the transmission method, Brockmann contends that his global mobility network represents the wave pattern, while the rock and the liquid show the launch and spread of the disease. Using the global mobility network, we can see how a disease launched in one city might spread to the rest of the world. Brockmann developed visualizations of this phenomenon in Mexico City, Chicago, and London. Unfortunately, they also show how difficult it would be to contain or quarantine an outbreak in a global city. Although now that researchers understand how the underlying process works, it could be used to help cut off critical links in transmission.","Scientists have developed a system for predicting how rapidly a global pandemic might spread and where .

"The Islamic State has in just a couple of months executed at least 116 foreign fighters who wanted to quit jihad and return home, a British-based human rights monitoring group claims. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the men killed were foreign fighters who had joined the insurgency but were caught trying to leave territory controlled by militants. But the monitoring group warned numbers were probably underestimates. 'We believe that the real number of people that had been killed by IS is higher than the number documented,' it said on its website. Scroll down for video . No letting go: An Islamic State fighter plants the group's flag. It has executed at least 116 foreign fighters who wanted to quit jihad and return home, a British-based human rights monitoring group claims . No turning back: The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the men killed were foreign fighters who had joined the insurgency but were caught trying to leave territory controlled by militants . Those killed for their attempted desertion were among a total of at least 1,878 people executed in six months by the self-styled Islamic State, which enforces an extreme version of religious law on the areas it controls. The militant group has taken vast parts of Iraq and Syria and declared a caliphate in territory under its control in June. Since then it has fought the Syrian and Iraqi governments, other insurgents and Kurdish forces. Rami Abdulrahman, the head of the Syrian monitoring group, told Reuters that Islamic State killed at least 1,175 civilians, including eight women and four children. He said 930 of the civilians were members of the Sheitaat, a Sunni Muslim tribe from eastern Syria which fought Islamic State for control of two oilfields in August. Islamic State has publicised beheadings and stoning of many people in areas it controls in Syria and Iraq. These are for actions that violate its reading of Islamic law, such as adultery, homosexuality, stealing and blasphemy. It nevertheless may come as a surprise that more than one in every twenty people executed by Islamic State is a foreign fighter who had travelled to join their cause. The insurgency raging across Iraq and Syria has drawn many thousands of disaffected, young and radicalised Sunni Muslims who believe it is a chance to show their pious devotion while having the adventure of a lifetime. Sunni youths in towns overrun by the insurgent group also face a stark choice, between becoming fighters or suicide bombers for the group. Last week a 14-year-old handed himself in to Iraqi authorities after he was sent to blow himself up inside a Shia mosque. Radical Muslims: Those killed for their attempted desertion were among a total of at least 1,878 people executed in six months by the self-styled Islamic State, which enforces an extreme version of religious law . Ruthless: The Observatory said Islamic State had also executed 502 soldiers fighting for President Bashar al-Assad - like these pilots who had their throats cut on an online video - and 81 anti-Assad insurgents . Islamic State has become notorious for its brutality, releasing videos of executions of captured enemy fighters, activists and journalists. It beheaded two U.S. journalists, and one American and two British aid workers this year in attempts to put pressure on a U.S.-led international coalition, which has been bombing its fighters in Syria since September. Mr Abdulrahman, who gathers information from all sides of the Syrian conflict, said that Islamic State had also executed 502 soldiers fighting for President Bashar al-Assad and 81 anti-Assad insurgents. He said that 116 foreign fighters who had joined Islamic State but later wanted to return home, were executed in the Syrian provinces of Deir Al-Zor, Raqqa and Hassakeh since November. Four other Islamic State fighters were killed on other charges, Abdulrahman said. The overwhelming number of the group's victims have been from the Syrian population. More than 200,000 people have been killed in the Syrian civil war, which started when pro-democracy protests in 2011 spiralled into an armed rebellion against the regime of Bashar al-Assad.","Figures compiled by the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights .

"Purses, wallets and cash will become redundant within three years, according to the electronic payment firm PayPal. It says it will be possible to pay for everyday purchases via mobile phone apps and cards with the result people will no longer need to carry real money. The claims came as the firm, which is owned by eBay, unveiled a new roll-out of its mobile phone-based smart payment system. Scroll down for video . Old-fashioned: Shoppers will soon be able to leave their purses and wallets at home, according to PayPal . Shoppers can download a PayPal app to their smartphone which can be pared with the payment system of participating retailers, from cafes and bakers to market stalls. This means shoppers can authorise payments on their phone, with the money immediately transferred to the trader, just as they currently do with internet purchases. The retailer gets a ‘payment confirmed’ message on their own smartphone or tablet which includes a picture of the customer by way of a security guarantee. PayPal research suggests that most consumers do not carry more than £20 in cash on them. Already, many people rarely use cash on a day to day basis, relying on debit and credit cards for all their purchases, whether it is petrol, a train ticket, a newspaper or a sandwich for lunch. The new PayPal smartphone app adds another alternative to folding money and coins. Futuristic: The new PayPal Here app will be launched today at London's Covent Garden market, pictured . The internet giant PayPal wants shoppers to pay for items electronically while standing in a shop . It also means retailers who have not taken card payments in the past, such as market traders, now have a new relatively cheap and new way to allow customers to pay. The adoption of automated payment systems rather than face-to-face transactions involving cash is gathering pace. Boris Johnson recently announced that hundreds of London Underground ticket offices will close next year. People are being encouraged to use Oyster cards and new generation of contactless debit and credit cards that can be swiped across ticket barrier terminals. On the high street, retailers from coffee shops to newsagents now accept the contactless cards, which do not require users to put in a four digit PIN, for small value purchases. Retailers are also slimming down the number of traditional purses, which can carry cash and coins, on their shelves in favour of slimline card holders. The new PayPal Here app and smartphone system, which can authorise a payment either with or without using a debit card, is being launched today at London’s Covent Garden market. The firm claims that the system can help small businesses, which may be missing out on up to £800 million worth of sales every year by not taking card payments. Futuristic: The latest move could end the days of fumbling for cash, already a rare sight on the high street . Narik Patel, PayPal’s director of mobile merchant services, said: ‘We know from our research that shoppers don’t usually carry more than £20 these days, so it’s great to see that these traders will never miss a sale again because a customer has to dash off to get cash. ‘This is another step on the journey towards a wallet-less high street, where customers will be able to leave their wallet or purse at home and pay using their phone or tablet. We predict that by 2016 this will become a reality.’ The firm’s PR director, Rob Skinner, added: ‘We believe that is because using a mobile to pay for things will be so commonplace that people will not feel the need to carry cash. ‘We are not saying that no-one will use money or plastic cards, only that it will be possible to live day to day without them.’ Artist Adam Regester, who sells his work at Covent Garden, has been using the system on a trial basis for a few weeks. Rare: Customers often carry less than £20, leaving few options for traders who don't accept credit cards . He said: ‘For as long as I can remember, we’ve always relied on customers paying with cash or perhaps the odd cheque. But now I’ve lost count of how many times people ask to pay by card or say they’ll just pop to the cash point but never come back. ‘Giving our customers more options to pay and taking cards solves the problem, which is especially crucial in the run-up to Christmas. Even within these first few weeks, I’ve seen an increase in sales.’ The system has already been operating with a number of small traders in Richmond, south west London, since August. Participants include a hotel and a number of coffee shops, cafes and restaurants.","PayPal Here app allows users to transfer funds while standing in a shop .

"If you love history, drama and strategy the re-enactment of a medieval chess set played with real-life people and horses in Veneto, Italy, is something that has to be seen. The unique  game is played bi-annually in September at the Piazza degli Scacchi (Chess Square) in Marostica. The remarkable two-hour extravaganza is played out with  intrinsic medieval detail and a mix of 550 walk-on parts, all of whom are dressed in full medieval costume. There are also dozens of colourful gonfalons, fire displays, dancing and ancient music throughout the show. The performance, which draws tourists from far and wide, is so successful that performers have been invited to travel as far away as Toronto in Canada to perform their inspiring medieval routine. The event was inspired by a real game of chess, which was played with living pawns back in 1454 when Marostica was a region of the Republic of Venice. In 1454 two noble knights fell in love with Lionora, who was the beautiful daughter of the Lord of the manor of Marostica Taddeo Parisio.

Medieval magic: Soldiers march during the event (left) while instruments are played by musicians (on right) Fire display: A fire display is also part of the spectacular show which lasts for two hours . It was customary at the time for two men who sought the hand of the same woman to enter into a duel, however, Mr Parisio was reluctant to lose one of his men and instead he ordered them to compete in a chess game. The unique game was set up with living pawns and the two men had to direct them which moves to take. The chess game took place in the midst of a celebration day which attracted noblemen and peasants and included music, parades of knights and foot soldiers, fires and jugglers. The innovative event was devised as an ideal way to replace bloodshed with a positive celebration and the success of the chess game has been preserved and re-enacted to this day.

"The levels of consciousness experienced by patients in a vegetative is still a mystery. But scientists are coming closer than ever to proving that patients locked in their body can understand their environment. Now a new study in Israel suggests people in a vegetative state can react emotionally to photographs of people they know personally, . Patients in a vegetative state may be able to recognise photographs of their loved ones, research reveals . Dr Haggai Sharon from Tel Aviv University, who led the research alongside Dr Yotam Pasternak, said: 'We showed that patients in a vegetative state can react differently to different stimuli in the environment depending on their emotional value. 'It's not a generic thing; it's personal and autobiographical. We engaged the person, the individual, inside the patient.' The findings, published in the journal PLOS ONE, deepen our understanding of patients in comas and may offer hope for improved treatments. For many years patients in a vegetative state were believed to have no awareness of self or environment. However, in recent years doctors have use MRI scans of brain activity and discovered that some people can perform complex cognitive tasks on command like imagining a physical activity such as playing tennis. In one case a patient was even able to answer 'yes' or 'no' questions. In response to all the photographs an area of the brain responsible for facial recognition was activated, indicating that their brain knew they were looking at faces . In August, scientists were able to communicate with a patient who was thought to be in a vegetative state for the past 12 years. Researchers in Canada used a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner to look at the brain activity of a previously non-responsive patient while asking a series of set questions. While inside the scanner, the patient answered several questions, such as ‘are you in a hospital? by concentrating on the specific words, ‘yes’ or ‘no’. In this way, the patient reported that he knew what his name was and that he was in the hospital at the time of communication. ‘This new technique takes communication with some patients who are assumed to be in a vegetative state to the next level,’ said researcher Adrian Owen. ‘It will make detecting who is conscious and who is not much faster and more reliable and for those who are conscious, communicating their wishes will be that much easier.’ In two different hospital visits, five months apart, the researchers were able to communicate with the patient but found that he was also aware of his environment, meaning he could maintain coherent thoughts and lead a rich mental life. But these cases are rare and do not reveal whether or not a patient is having a personal emotional experience when they are in a vegetative state. To gain insight into 'what it feels like to be in a vegetative state' they worked with four patients who were in a vegetative state, either persistent (month-long), or permanent (over three months). The patients were shown photographs of people they did and did not personally know then gauged the patients' reactions using MRI, which measures blood flow in the brain to detect areas of neurological activity. In response to all the photographs an area of the brain responsible for facial recognition was activated, indicating that their brain knew they were looking at faces. However in response to the photographs of close family members and friends, areas of the brain associated with emotion and memory were also activated in the patients brains. In other words the patients' emotional responses suggested that they recognised the people in the photographs. The ability to register and categorise complex visual information and link it to memories is previously unheard of in vegetative patients. However the researchers could not be sure if the patients were conscious of their emotions or just reacting spontaneously. They asked patients to imagine their parents' faces. A 60-year-old teacher who was hit by a car showed complex activity similar to that of a normal, healthy person. Researchers believe she is evidence that vegetative patients can be 'emotionally aware'. A second woman, 23, showed activity in just the emotion specific brain regions. Both women woke up within two months of the tests and did not remember being in a vegetative state. 'This experiment, a first of its kind, demonstrates that some vegetative patients may not only possess emotional awareness of the environment but also experience emotional awareness driven by internal processes, such as images,' said Dr Sharon. The team believe their work could be a first step toward finding better treatment. The patients were shown photographs of people they did and did not personally know then gauged the patients' reactions using MRI (pictured), which measures blood flow in the brain to detect areas of neurological activity .","MRI scanners measured blood flow in brain to detect areas of brain .

"California's whooping cough epidemic is here to stay.

Two-month-old Saoirse Ball gets the whooping cough vaccine while being held by her mother Erinne (file photo) Data from the California Department of Public Health shows just how low the number of cases of the disease got before it began to spike again in the last few years . Up until Nov. 26, the state has registered 9,935 cases of the illness. This number is so high, it hadn't been surpassed since the late 1940s, according to the California Department of Public Health. The last epidemic in California was in 2010, when 9, 159 cases were reported — including 10 deaths. A school nurse in Los Angeles prepares a whooping cough vaccine (file photo) Public health officials say one of the reasons for the higher number of cases is the use since the '90s of a type of vaccine that causes 'fewer reactions' but does 'not protect as long.' Experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that the most highly affected group was infants. But there was also a peak in cases among teens ages 14 to 16, according to the CDC. What's worse: the CDC warns that cases of the disease among teens is 'likely' to increase 'in the absence of a new vaccine or more effective vaccination strategy.' 'As long as currently available acellular pertussis vaccines are in use, it is likely that the “new normal” will be higher disease incidence throughout pertussis cycles,' the CDC said in its Dec. 5 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.","Cases of the whooping cough, or pertussis, have reached its highest incidence since the late '40s .

"The Navy SEAL who shot three bullets into Osama Bin Laden's head said putting the terrorist leader in his place is less stressful than putting a golf ball. 'Golf’s more stressful than combat,' esteemed Navy SEAL Rob O’Neill, 28, told the New York Post on Friday at The Tuscany Hotel in New York.

"The United States will keep up to 1,000 more soldiers than previously planned in Afghanistan into next year, outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Saturday, in a recognition of the still formidable challenge from Taliban insurgents. Hagel, confirming a change in the U.S. drawdown schedule first reported by Reuters in November, said the additional forces were needed because delays in signing security pacts had impacted plans to raise troops from other countries. However, he also said that a particularly violent surge of Taliban attacks in Kabul in the last two weeks was a reminder of the continued need for a foreign presence. Scroll down for video .

Hagel said Saturday the United States will keep as many as 1,000 more troops in Afghanistan than planned . Afghan troops in ceremonial uniforms participate in an arrival ceremony for visiting US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel at the Presidential Palace in Kabul . 'The recent wave of Taliban attacks has made it clear that the international community must not waver in its support for a stable, secure and prosperous Afghanistan,' said Hagel, who arrived in Kabul unannounced on Saturday morning. The NATO-led combat mission in Afghanistan officially ends in two weeks with a sharp reduction in western forces, but troops that stay behind will still provide 'combat enabler' support to Afghan soldiers, Hagel said. The United States will also maintain a mission to fight al Qaeda in the country, he added. 'We have not forgotten what brought America to Afghanistan over a decade ago,' Hagel said at a joint press conference with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. 'And we will take appropriate measures against Taliban members who directly threaten U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan or provide direct support to al Qaeda.' US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel speaks during a joint press conference. An additional 1,000 US troops will remain in Afghanistan next year to meet a temporary shortfall in NATO forces .

Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani (L) reaches out to shake hands with U.S. Secretary of Defense. The United States will keep up to 1,000 more soldiers than previously planned in Afghanistan into next year  in a recognition of the still formidable challenge from Taliban insurgents . Gen. John Campbell, the commander of international forces in Afghanistan, said last week the ongoing U.S. role would include limited air support to Afghan soldiers. Hagel, who resigned last week under pressure, said U.S. forces could fall only to 10,800 troops, rather than 9,800 as originally planned. The additional troops could stay until the first few months of 2015. 'But the president's authorization will not change our troops' missions, or the long-term timeline for our drawdown,' Hagel said on his last trip to the country as Pentagon chief. He appeared confident that the United States would secure support from NATO allies in the next few weeks that would allow U.S. force levels to drop back to 9,800. Hagel's visit followed the bloodiest year in Afghanistan since the war against Taliban militants began in 2001. As of early November, about 4,600 members of the Afghan security forces had been killed in 2014, more than 6 percent higher than the same period of 2013. The spike in violence in the Afghan capital was not a factor in the decision to keep more U.S. troops in the country next year, a Defense Department official said . The drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan will be 'gradual' compared with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, the first official said.In 2016, the number of troops will slide down to 5,500 and by 2017 the coalition will consolidate to Kabul . Even as U.S. officials including Hagel praised the accomplishments of Afghan forces, the high rate of Afghan casualties is seen as unsustainable and has raised questions about their vulnerability as foreign troops dwindle. Earlier, Hagel expressed confidence in the ability of Afghan forces to defend Kabul following the spike in attacks. U.S. President Barack Obama's drawdown strategy has attracted criticism, including from Republicans in Congress, who say gains against the Taliban could be lost in much the same way that violence returned to Iraq after the U.S. withdrawal. Hagel warned against drawing comparisons between Iraq and Afghanistan, saying Afghans want U.S. forces to stay. 'Are there (security) gaps? Are there continued challenges? And threats? Absolutely,' Hagel acknowledged, noting Afghanistan would still struggle with 'pockets' of Taliban resistance. The Taliban have become increasingly bold in their attacks and control several districts across a country where access to many areas is still limited by rugged terrain and poor security. Maintaining a troop presence will allow the U.S. to monitor the progress of the Afghan security forces over time .","Up to 10,800 U.S. troops will remain in Afghanistan at the start of 2015 .

"A baby boy who was hurled 200ft by floodwater that tore down his bedroom wall has been found alive. One-year-old Tristan Scarcy was asleep on Tuesday when a mudslide burst into the family home in Joshua Tree, California. His parents rushed to find him, but the entire room had already been gutted by the storm, which saw an inch of rain fall in less than 25 minutes. Incredibly, as they surveyed the tragic scene the next morning, they spotted something in the mud across a field: Tristan. Miracle: One-year-old Tristan Scarcy was asleep when the mudslide burst into his room and sent him flying . Incredible: The boy appeared to have suffered few injuries after the wall of his bedroom (pictured) collapsed . Despite being in shock, the infant appeared healthy and simply relieved to be taken home. 'We really thought he was gone,' his mother Ryan Scarcy told NBC. 'We came round thinking we can break a window to get in, and the wall was gone. 'His room was gone and he was nowhere to be found.' Stains on the wall of the now-destroyed home show how the waves swept in under a doorway, then rose to the ceiling before bursting out of a wall and into the front yard, over a barbed wire fence. The mud rose so high  that they had to force their way into the wreckage before they could see the little boy poking out of the mud. Discovered: This is the rough plain of mud where Tristan's parents saw him poking his head out hours later . Dangerous: He scaled a barbed wire fence during the flash floods which saw an inch of rain fall in 20 minutes . Manic: The family had no hope that Tristan would survive after seeing all the broken glass in his room . Tristian's father Brian Bennett said: 'My friend busted the living room window, came in here and pointed out ""dude, your son's over there"". 'So I turned around, saw him and he poked his head out the mud. 'He was in shock.' Tristan was sent flying with all his belongings, which are now buried in the mud along with all the family's furniture, clothes and treasured possessions. Trauma: Mother Ryan Scarcy (left) and father Tristan Bennett (right) were distraught as they couldn't find him . Shocked: They were shocked as they looked out of the bedroom to see the infant lodged in the mud 200ft away . But his mother Ryan says Tristan's safety is all that matters. 'I'm really thankful to have our son and that was the most important thing to us, that he is still alive.' The family's traumatic experience came as vast swathes of Joshua Tree National Park were destroyed by the floods which hit on Monday and lasted for more than 24 hours.

"President Barack Obama's persistent sore throat - which saw him whisked to a military hospital by motorcade for a CAT scan on Saturday - was caused by acid reflux,  the White House has said. Obama, 53, reportedly underwent a fiber optic exam  by an ear, nose and throat specialist at the Washington residence on Saturday morning after complaining of a sore throat for two weeks. He was then driven via motorcade to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where a CAT scan was performed. The results came back normal, it is said. Now, Obama's physician Dr Ronny Jackson, director of the White House Medical Unit, has revealed that the exams' combined results show  that the president is suffering from acid reflux. Scroll down for video . Motorcade: President Barack Obama is pictured being driven via motorcade to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, on Saturday afternoon after complaining of a persistent sore throat . Under the weather: Once at the hospital, the president (pictured on Friday) underwent a CAT scan. Combined with the results of a fiber optic exam, the results revealed that Obama is suffering from acid reflux, it is said . 'The president's symptoms are consistent with soft tissue inflammation related to acid reflux and will be treated accordingly,' Mr Jackson said, without elaborating on subsequent treatment. Acid reflux is caused when  the muscle fibers in the lower esophagus do not close properly, causing the contents of the stomach to flow back up the esophagus. This often leads to severe heartburn. Other symptoms include nausea after eating, coughing and difficulty swallowing. Treatments involve avoiding certain foods and using over-the-counter or prescription medications, like antacids. In a statement, Mr Jackson said the fiber optic exam, carried out at the White House shortly after Obama awoke, revealed 'soft tissue swelling' in the back of the president's throat. Hospital: Following the fiber optic exam, two medical experts determined 'further evaluation with a routine CT scan was prudent'. Above, Obama with aide Bobby Schmuck (right) outside the Walter Reed center in July . He and the unidentified ENT specialist from the Fort Belvoir Medical Center in Northern Virginia then determined that 'further evaluation with a routine CT scan was prudent', he said. The scan results came back normal, he added. However, ABC News's Chief Medial and Health Editor, Dr Richard Besser, said that Obama's hospital tests 'did not hold true with what you'd normally see' in the case of a sore throat. Acid reflux is caused when the muscle fibers in the lower esophagus do not close properly, causing the contents of the stomach to flow back up the esophagus. This often leads to severe heartburn and a sore throat. Other symptoms include nausea after eating, coughing and difficulty swallowing. There are many risk factors for the condition. Smoking, alcohol and hiatal hernia all increase the risk of developing acid reflux, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. For treatment, sufferers are often told to avoid certain foods and use over-the-counter or prescription medications, like antacids. 'Normally for a sore throat, initially you'll do a test for strep. If it goes on for a couple of weeks, you might do a scope, but not a CT,' he said. 'It may be that he is a former smoker, he's the president of the United States - you'll often see presidents get extra testing.' Obama's departure to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center at 2pm caught reporters off guard. It is unusual for a president to seek medical care outside of the White House. The president was reportedly at the hospital for half an hour, before being driven back to the residence in the rainy weather. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr Jackson had suggested Obama have the diagnostic test done on Saturday afternoon because he had free time in his schedule. Rain had kept Obama off the golf course, where he spends most Saturdays when the weather permits, said Mr Earnest. 'The quickly scheduled test is a matter of convenience for the president, not a matter of urgency,' Earnest said. In May, Obama had a physical exam and was said to be in excellent health. Although Mr Jackson did not give a cause for Obama's case of acid reflux, there are many risk factors for the condition. Medic: 'The president's symptoms are consistent with soft tissue inflammation related to acid reflux and will be treated accordingly,' Obama's physician Dr Ronny Jackson (above), of the White House Medical Unit, said . These include smoking, the use of alcohol and hiatal hernia, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Mr Besser said the type of treatment the president will receive in coming days depends on the severity of his symptoms and how long he has been experiencing them. For a 'slow approach', 'you would have him raise the head of his bed, stop smoking, if he's still smoking, cut down on alcohol and cut back on those foods that are causing problems,' he said. He added that Obama would be prescribed medication only if the above steps did not work.","President Barack Obama underwent fiber optic exam Saturday morning .

"The scientist who pioneered the cervical cancer vaccine was found dead by her husband at their £2million home after he warned she was ‘heading for a crisis’ by working too hard. Dr Anne Szarewski, 53, a university lecturer whose discovery has saved thousands of lives, was begged to slow down by her husband, who was becoming increasingly concerned about the pressure she was putting on herself. In August he found her dead in their four-bedroom home in West Hampstead, north London, after he spent two hours drilling through a door she had locked from the inside. Mystery: Doctors are still at a loss to explain Dr Anne Szarewski's death in her Hampstead home in August . Doctors are still at a loss to explain what exactly caused the researcher’s death. She was found with high levels of an anti-malarial drug in her bloodstream, but doctors said this was not thought to have caused her death. Her husband Lester Venter said that, before her death, he and many of her friends had become extremely worried about her heavy workload. Dr Szarewski, who used her maiden name, was preparing for five international work trips and had been complaining that she was experiencing all-over body pains with ‘mounting intensity’. University lecturer: Dr Anne Szarewski's discovery has saved thousands of lives . Mr Venter, 63, told the inquest into her death at St Pancras Coroner’s Court: ‘I was in the habit of telling her that she was heading for a crisis. I just realised she couldn’t maintain the pace that she was setting for herself.’ Dr Szarewski is credited with . discovering the link between the human papillomavirus and cervical . cancer, leading to a vaccine for HPV – the first-ever vaccine against . any form of cancer – which is now routinely given to girls across the . country. Her husband described her work as ‘nothing short of historic’. Born . in London to Polish parents, she studied medicine at Middlesex Hospital . before working at the Whittington Hospital in Highgate, North London. Latterly . she worked as a gynaecologist at the Margaret Pike Centre in King’s . Cross, was a clinical lecturer at the Wolfson Institute, Queen Mary, . University of London, and also worked for Cancer Research. Her . husband of ten years, a former political journalist from South Africa, . told the court the couple slept in separate bedrooms because they . enjoyed their own space. Mr . Venter said that he woke up on August 24 after a night at the theatre . and when his wife did not come down for breakfast he was initially . pleased that she was having a well-deserved lie-in. When she still had not emerged at 2pm, however, he became concerned and found her bedroom door was locked. Employment: Born in London to Polish parents, she studied medicine at Middlesex Hospital before working at the Whittington Hospital (pictured) in Highgate, North London . After . two hours trying to open it with an electric drill, he forced his way . inside. ‘As I entered the room I saw her on the bed and I realised . straight away that she was dead,’ he said. The . couple’s home contained two-and-a-half cupboards of medication, a . collection Mr Venter described as one of his wife’s ‘charming . eccentricities’. A pathologist’s report read out to the inquest found the scientist died with a fatally inflamed pancreas. 'She was unique. She was cheerful, erudite and quite the finest person it has been my privilege to know. On the scientific level, her achievements have been nothing short of historic' Lester Venter, husband . The . anti-malaria drug Chloroquine was discovered in her blood. It is known . to be highly toxic in overdose quantities. A packet was later found in . the house but this is not thought to have been the cause of death and . the coroner recorded a verdict of death by natural causes.

"Ice sheets surrounding the North and South poles make up 10 per cent of our entire planet’s surface, and it’s thought Earth contains five million cubic miles of frozen water - so what would happen if it all melted? National Geographic has created a series of interactive maps demonstrating the catastrophic effect Earth’s ice could cause if it melted and flowed into the oceans and seas. This could cause sea levels to rise by 216 feet, devouring cities and even countries all the while drastically altering how continents and coastlines look, and wiping out entire populations. National Geographic recently created a series of maps similar to Mr Vargic¿s, demonstrating the catastrophic effect Earth¿s ice could cause if it melted and flowed into the oceans and seas. If these ice sheets melted, the rest of the world would be affected. In Europe, pictured, cities including London and Venice would be lost underwater, as would the whole of the Netherlands and most of Denmark. It would also cause the Mediterranean to expand and swell the Black and Caspian Seas . How Britain would look if the ice sheets melted. A large proportion of the country would be left underwater . Scientists believe it could take around 5,000 years for temperatures to rise significantly enough to melt all the ice on the planet, but claim the planet is already seeing the beginnings of this. Over the past century, reports suggest the Earth's temperature has increased by around half a degree Celsius and, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), this has already caused sea levels to rise by around seven inches. The largest concentrations of ice on Earth are found in Greenland and Antarctica but it is also found on exposed areas, on mountain tops and in other regions. The East Antarctica ice sheet, for example, is so . large it contains around 80 per cent of all the ice on the planet and . its size has protected it previously during warmer periods in Earth’s . history. This includes during the Eocene epoch - . a period of increased global temperatures that lasted from  56 to 34 . million years ago. During . this period of time, little to no ice was present on Earth and there was . little difference in temperature at the equator compared to the poles. Warming oceans are already melting the floating ice sheet in west Antarctica and since 1992, National Geographic reports the sheet has lost around 65 million metric tonnes of ice each year. The ice sheets in Greenland and west . Antarctica shrank significantly during the epoch and if temperatures . were to rise in a similar manner again, the ice sheets across the . regions could disappear into the sea completely. The last time the Earth was ice-free was 34 million years ago during the Eocene epoch. If this happened again, the entire Atlantic seaboard in the U.S would vanish, wiping out Florida and the Gulf Coast. While the hills in San Francisco would become islands and San Diego would be lost forever . If these sheets melted, it would create a knock-on effect for the rest of the world. In Europe, for example, cities including London and Venice would be lost underwater, as would the whole of the Netherlands and most of Denmark. It would also cause the Mediterranean to expand and swell the Black and Caspian Seas. The EPA claims that overall ice reduction depends on several factors, including the rate at which levels of greenhouse gases rise and how global temperatures react to this increase in gas. The largest concentrations of ice on Earth are found in Greenland and Antarctica, pictured. Warming oceans are already melting the floating ice sheet in west Antarctica and since 1992, National Geographic reports the sheet loses around 65 million metric tonnes each year. If they melted it could cause the sea levels to rise globally by 216 feet . The Eocene epoch was a period of increased global temperatures that lasted from 56 to 34 million years ago. During this period of time, little to no ice was found on Earth and there was little difference in temperature at the equator compared to the poles. The planet slowly cooled as carbon dioxide from the air locked inside seafloor sediments. During this decrease ice began to reappear at the poles, and the Antarctic ice sheet began to expand rapidly. This rise in greenhouse gases could be caused by humans, as National Geographic explained: ‘If we burn all the Earth’s supply of coal, oil, and gas, adding some five trillion more tonnes of carbon to the atmosphere, we’ll create a very hot planet with an average temperature of perhaps 80 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the current 58. Large swaths of it might become too hot for humans.’ This would make the Earth ice-free for the first time in 34 million years. If this happened, the entire Atlantic seaboard in the U.S would vanish, wiping out Florida and the Gulf Coast. While the hills in San Francisco would become islands and San Diego would be lost forever. In the east, China and Bangladesh would both be completely flooded, wiping out around 760 million people based on current population levels.The coastlines of India would also be reduced. Whereas in South America, the Amazon Basin and the Paraguay River Basin would both become Atlantic inlets and this would wipe out Buenos Aires, coastal Uruguay, and some of Paraguay. The only areas that would survive are mountainous stretches along the Caribbean coast and in Central America. The other continents would escape a little more lightly, but would still be affected. In the east, parts of Asia, including China and Bangladesh would be completely flooded, wiping out around 760 million people based on current population levels. Parts of India's coastline would also be lost and eroded inland. National Geographic said: 'If we burn all the Earth's supply of coal, oil, and gas, adding some five trillion more tonnes of carbon to the atmosphere, we'll create a very hot planet with an average temperature of perhaps 80 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the current 58' In Africa, for example, Egypt, Alexandria and Cairo would be flooded but the continent wouldn’t lose as much of its land to the rising seas. National Geographic claims the Earth’s rising heat ‘might make much of it inhabitable’ though. Australia would gain a new inland sea but it ‘would lose much of the narrow coastal strip where four out of five Australians now live.’ SOURCES: Philippe Huybrechts, Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Richard S Williams, JR., Woods Hole Research center; James C.

"Blaze: A teenage work experience girl set fire to the wilko store in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, because she was 'a bit bored' A teenage private schoolgirl who was 'fed up' of her work experience in a shop set fire to it, causing £1million damage, a court heard. The girl, 15, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was working in a wilko shop, formerly known as Wilkinson's, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, on placement from her fee-paying private school when she started the blaze with a cigarette lighter. Staff and customers had to be evacuated as thick black smoke filled the shop as the fire, which began in a cage in a warehouse behind the shop, swept the premises. Warwick Crown Court heard the 'intelligent student' set fire to waste cardboard in a cage in the goods inward bay as she was fed up of stacking shelves and wanted to go home for the day. Fire crews were called after the blaze got out of control, and spent more than half an hour battling to quench the fire which began at around 12.20pm on July 8 this year. The girl was arrested by police shortly afterwards, and admitted to officers it was a 'stupid thing to do.' Ninda Gill, prosecuting, said: 'The incident occurred at lunchtime when the store was busy with customers, and elderly customers were caused distress. 'The potential for injury to staff and customers was great as the store was consumed by smoke.' Miss Gill added that, as a result of the blaze, the hardware chain was now reviewing its national policy in relation to taking on any more work experience students. She said: 'It has caused a national employer not to engage in work experience schemes.' CCTV footage played in court showed the teenager leaning into a cage of waste cardboard in the goods inbound bay. Smoke began to rise one minute later and, as she left the bay, flames began flickering, which quickly turned into an inferno. Fire investigators rated the danger to life at eight on a scale of one to ten, although the building was evacuated without anyone being injured. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, hoped to start a small fire that would get her sent home . Fire crews were called and it took more than half an hour to extinguish the flames at the homeware store . The blaze was tackled by five fire crews using breathing apparatus and a 'conservative estimate' has been put on the damage caused at between £600,000 and £1 million. John Mohammed, defending, said: 'To a degree she got a bit bored, and she would have liked to have done something more exciting than stocking shelves. 'When she went to the goods inward area she intended to start what she thought would be a small fire in a crate, as she described it, which contained cardboard boxes. 'She lit the corner of a box, and did not expect it to spread any further than the cage it was in.  She thought it would cause some disruption, sufficient for her to be able to go home.' He added: 'She didn't realise how quickly the fire would spread to other boxes - she certainly did not intend to harm anyone.' Shoppers and staff had to be evacuated at fire swept through the store at lunchtime, filling it with black smoke . Mr Mohammed said the girl came from a good family, and her parents were 'aghast' at what she did. He said she bitterly regrets what she did, and she had written a letter of apology to Wilkinson. The teenager herself said: 'When I was doing it I didn't think of the consequences - it was a stupid act. If I could turn the clock back, I would.' The girl, who admitted arson with intent to cause damage and being reckless as to whether lives were endangered, was due to be sentenced this week. But Judge Alan Parker ordered for her to be examined by a psychiatrist first, saying: 'I am very concerned about her, and very concerned about the dissociation referred to. 'The fact that she is an intelligent girl makes it more disturbing.'","Teenager, who cannot be named, was on placement from fee-paying school .

"The decomposed body of Theresa DeKeyzer was found stuffed inside a 55-gallon plastic drum at a Detroit-area storage facility three months after she was reported missing. Results from an autopsy of the Michigan woman's remains checked over the weekend. DeKeyzer's boyfriend Scott Wobbe reported that he last saw the 22-year-old on June 16 near her Warren home, police said. The boyfriend has been jailed for violating probation in a Midland County drug case. Horror: The decomposed body of Theresa DeKeyzer was found stuffed inside a 55-gallon plastic drum at a Detroit-area storage facility three months after she was reported missing . X-ray equipment was used to help determine the contents of the barrel, according to the state police . Since her disappearance, DeKeyzer hadn't used her cellphone, accessed her bank account or picked up her paycheck, The Detroit News reported earlier this month. In her home, police found that she had left behind her cellphone charger, a half-finished cigarette resting in an ashtray, and a medical marijuana card prescribed for depression/anxiety. The body was found Thursday at Travel Trailer Storage in Plymouth Township after Warren police executed a search warrant, Plymouth Township detective Charlie Rozum said. Police were led to the facility after receiving tips. The trailer was later removed, storage facility manager Doris Temple told the Detroit Free Press. Temple, who has worked at the facility for over 30 years, said the discovery terrified her. 'I've never had anything like this happen, and it's kind of frightening for me,' Temple said. Temple said a man had rented the storage facility nine days before DeKeyzer disappeared. DeKeyzer had been assaulted the night before her disappearance by boyfriend Scott Wobbe, right, who is considered the main suspect . Both storage facility employees and police said they were disturbed by the bizarre and gruesome discovery at the Michigan storage locker . She declined to identify the renter to reporters. 'It was an enclosed trailer, it had no windows, no nothing, just the back opens, that's it,' she said. 'Sixteen feet long, maybe.' Rozum said investigators believe the barrel was filled with sand and was sealed with a concrete cap. He said the barrel was inside a small trailer. X-ray equipment was used to help determine the contents of the barrel, according to the state police. The body was removed from the barrel Friday with the assistance of a forensic anthropologist, said Mary Mazur, a spokeswoman for the Wayne County medical examiner's office. DeKeyzer was identified by her tattoos, clothing, and jewelry. There were also crime scene photos available from a domestic assault reported the day before her disappearance when, according to police, a drunken Wobbe assaulted her. Wobbe reportedly dragged her out of his car by her shirt and punched her in the face. 'Obviously, the discovery is linked to the suspect in the case,' Warren Police Commissioner Jere Green told Detroit CBS, referring to Wobbe. DeKeyzer's family said they had been rocked by the horrifying discovery but were survivors . In DeKeyzer's home, police found that she had left behind her cellphone charger, a half-finished cigarette resting in an ashtray, and a medical marijuana card prescribed for depression/anxiety . Wobbe is now in jail on drug charges and for violating his probation with the assault. Green said he too had been disturbed by this unique crime. 'It was quite disturbing to see a 22-year-old young gal stuff in a 55-gallon drum and cement poured over her in the fetal position,' he said. DeKeyzer's family said they were devastated. 'My heart breaks for my cousins and my aunt,' Melody Baetens, a Detroit New staff writer and cousing to the victim told the paper. 'They have a lot of family support and they're going to get through it. 'The DeKeyzers have been through a lot these last few years, and they don't deserve this. But there's a lot of love in this family, and we're all here for them.'","Theresa DeKeyzer, 22, was last seen alive on June 16 near her Warren home .

"A young Yazidi woman forced into sex slavery by the Islamic State begged the West to bomb the brothel where she was being held after militants raped her 30 times in just a few hours, it is claimed. The unidentified woman is understood to have been kept as a prisoner of the jihadists somewhere in western Iraq having been captured by ISIS during the Sinjar massacre in early August. A group raising awareness of ISIS' persecution of women in the vast swathes of the Middle East under its control said the woman had contacted Kurdish peshmerga fighters by telephone to plead for the brothel to be bombed to put the women held as sex slaves out of their misery. She allegedly told the fighters she had been raped so frequently that she could no longer use the toilet, adding that the ordeal has been so harrowing that she plans to commit suicide even if freed. Scroll down for videos . Horror: The woman said she had been raped so many times by ISIS militants (pictured) that she could no longer use the toilet, adding that the ordeal has been so harrowing that she plans to commit suicide even if freed . No life: 5-7,000 Yazidi women are also being held in makeshift detention centres by ISIS, where they either been taken away and sold into slavery or handed over to jihadists as concubines . Details of the woman's brutal experience at the hands of the Islamic State emerged during an interview with Kurdish activists staging demonstrations in London to raise awareness of the plight of women in the Middle East. During an interview with BBC World Service, a man identified as Karam described how a friend embedded with the peshmerga took a phone call from the Yazidi woman. Describing the woman as crying on the phone, Karam quoted her as saying: 'If you know where we are please bomb us... There is no life after this. I'm going to kill myself anyway - others have killed themselves this morning.' 'I've been raped 30 times and it's not even lunchtime. I can't go to the toilet. Please bomb us,' he claimed the woman added. Brutal: Last week the UN confirmed that thousands of Yazidis were slaughtered in scenes reminiscent of the Bosnian Srebrenica massacre when ISIS swept through northern Iraq in August . The group of Kurdish activists to which Karam belongs have been staging protests in central London to raise awareness of the plight of women living under the brutal oppression of the Islamic State. Among their recent demonstrations was the establishment of a mock-slave market where niqab-wearing women were seen chained together while masked men used loudspeakers to auction them off to the highest bidder. A video of the group's fake slave auction -  run to shock those living in the West into confronting the grim reality of ISIS rule - has already been viewed more than 265,000 times on YouTube . The group says they used information provided by sources on the ground to help them portray the scenes authentically. Displaced: A group of Yazidi women are photographed living in a refugee camp near the Syria-Iraq border having fled Islamic State militants during the Sinjar massacre . A Yazidi refugee carries her son as they flee ISIS militants near Sirnak - a city at the Turkey-Iraq border . Last week the UN confirmed that thousands of Yazidis were slaughtered in scenes reminiscent of the Bosnian Srebrenica massacre when ISIS swept through northern Iraq in August. Researchers, piecing together reports of attacks, have now concluded that more than 5,000 Yazidi were gunned down in a series of massacres by jihadist. A further 5-7,000 women are also being held in makeshift detention centres, where they either been taken away and sold into slavery or handed over to jihadists as concubines. Five detention centres in the town of Tal Afar is thought to hold around 3,500 women and children. An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane.

Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles. Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle' Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network. In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place. Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally. Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene.

"Snapchat is secretly testing a new line of location-specific filters in New York and Los Angeles. The firm has been testing the feature on its iOS app, using the iPhone's GPS system to pinpoint users and show the filters. For instance, Snapchat users who use the service in Brooklyn are shown a clear filter with the word ‘Brooklyn’ written in an artistic font, while those in New York's financial district can unlock filter featuring a shower of dollar bills. Scroll down for video . Enthusiastic Snapchat users in New York show off their custom filters featuring the word 'Brooklyn', when in Brooklyn,  and a sea of cash when pictures are taken near NYC's financial district. Go to the app’s settings menu, scroll down to ‘Additional Services’ and click ‘Manage’. Once there, ensure that you have the ‘Filters’ setting switched to ‘on’ and that you’ve given the app permission to pull your location. Users in Manhattan’s theater district receive a custom filter with the words ‘Broadway’ in yellow lights. Other users have received customized filters around events such as Gay Pride. The new smart filters don’t offer any photo-editing effects, and are simply clear filters with a graphic overlay. They look similar to they type of stickers that have been popularized by stand-alone photo editing applications. The filters appear to be a hit with users of the service - although Snapchat has not yet acknowlegded their existence or officially launched them. ‘Super cute snapchat filters based on your location the future is now’ @juliacosette, one Snapchat user, tweeted. ‘What is this new snap chat filter? I like it.’ tweeted another user, @debzshin. Snapchat currently doesn’t offer sponsored filters, however the company did recently debut its first customized branded filter at Cannes Lions advertising festival. Snapchat partnered with a publisher to add a corporate logo to snaps taken at a party along with the phrase, ‘Yes we Cannes’. It’s easy to see how branded stickers and sponsored filters could become a potential revenue stream for the company, which isn’t currently making money. Snapchat users are quick to share their new photo filters with friends and Twitter followers, but remain perplexed by the new feature . In February Facebook bought hugely popular messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion (£11.4 billion), after failing in a previous $3 billion to buy Snapchat. At the start of April, Vine revealed its ‘Vine Messages’ service that enabled users to send messages to each other. This directly followed once-popular social network Bebo’s attempts to get back into the game with Blab, their own video messaging service. Facebook, meanwhile, is busy trying to increase the profile of its Messenger app, with rumors that it will shift WhatsApp users onto its native messaging client. Facebook announced a selfie feature for Messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself. Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a direct messaging service last December. In May, Snapchat released the ability to chat with friends in real time via messenger. Brands such as Taco Bell and Rebecca Minkoff have sent out hundreds of snaps, and the ability to add their logo to Snapchat content could add extra legitimacy to their efforts. Last December, the app released its first major update when it added its first line of filters along with a ‘replay’ function. In May, Snapchat unveiled its own in-app instant messaging and video chat service. Last week, the company announced it was testing a new group-sharing feature for concerts and live events called Our Story. Both Apple and Facebook have released similar ephemeral messaging services in attempt to capitalize on Snapchat's runaway success. Facebook released Slingshot, its own service for sending self-destructing messages to friends in mid-June. Apple also added the ability to send self-destructing audio and video messages via iMessage. To enable new smart filters, update the app, go to the app’s settings menu, scroll down to ‘Additional Services’ and click ‘Manage’. Once there, ensure that you have the ‘Filters’ setting switched to ‘on’ and that you’ve given the app permission to pull your location. Snapchat founder, Evan Spiegel, in the company's California headquarters. The company is based in Los Angeles and is run by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, two former fraternity brothers at Stanford. The service was first released in 2011 and quickly gained a following among high school students in Southern California. The company does not reveal the number of people currently using its service, but says more than 700 million messages are sent each day.","Users can only 'unlock' the filters in certain geographic locations .

"Juan Mata has apologised for Manchester United's abysmal performance at Leicester City, saying he shared the pain of the fans after they twice surrendered a two-goal lead. United led 2-0 and 3-1 at the King Power Stadium before capitulating to lose 5-3 in a performance the Spaniard described as 'disappointing.' Mata vowed to the fans that United would bounce back in their next two home fixtures against West Ham and Everton. Juan Mata, who was a late substitute for Manchester United in their 5-3 defeat at Leicester, has apologised for their poor performance on his latest blog post . Mata was on the bench until the 76th minute at the King Power Stadium, when he came on for Angel di Maria . Writing on his blog, Mata, who came on for Angel di Maria 14 minutes from time, said: 'After a whole week waiting for the match I could not imagine a Sunday like this. 'The way back from Leicester to Manchester on the bus seemed really long. 'I kept thinking about how we lost a game that was under control, but the thing is we were ahead, they equalised and when we tried to get advantage again we lost. 'It's really tough to score three goals away and come back home with no points. 'On our way back to Manchester I was thinking about what had happened and felt so disappointed as all those that came with us to the stadium. 'Honestly, I feel very sorry that the weekend ended up for our fans in such a sad way.' Mata's afternoon in Leicester was in stark contrast to his performance in last weekend's 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers, in which he scored the fourth goal . The result exposed weaknesses in United's defence that Van Gaal and assistant Ryan Giggs must address . Saturday - West Ham (H) October 5 - Everton (H) October 20 - West Brom (A) October 26 - Chelsea (H) November 2 - Manchester City (A) November 8 - Crystal Palace (H) United were twice in a two-goal lead at Leicester but surrendered them both and had young defender Tyler Blackett sent off. Mata, who was left helpless in attack as Leicester wrapped up the win, said United's performances would improve. He wrote: 'There is time during the week to analyse what happened and learn from our mistakes so as not to make them again. 'Now we play two consecutive games in Old Trafford that we want to win for our fans. We will put our best efforts to it, you can be sure of that. 'I hope to be in a better mood next Sunday to tell you about the game and many other things, to try to put a smile in our face on Monday. 'Thank you for being there in the good and the bad times and never giving up. It is important to feel your support.' United were cruising to victory when Ander Herrera put them 3-1 up in the 57th minute . Jamie Vardy inspired Leicester's comeback and scored the goal that put them 4-3 up . United's miserable afternoon was compounded when Tyler Blackett was sent off for this foul on Vardy .","Juan Mata apologises for Man United's performance at Leicester .

"A second British jihadi has been killed fighting for the Islamic State in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane, it has been claimed. ISIS supporters on social media were yesterday mourning the death of 20-year-old Muslim convert Abu Abdullah al-Habashi, also known by a second nom de guerre of Abu Abdullah al-Britani. They now claim Abu Dharda, 20, also known as Abu Dhar Somali, was killed fighting alongside militants in the city. Scroll down for video . Abu Abdullah, 20 (left) and the man believed to be Abu Dharda, 20 (right) have been killed fighting in Kobane, it has been claimed . Dead: Abu Abdullah al-Habashi (pictured right, next to a militant named Abu Musa as-Somali ) has been killed fighting in Kobane. The 20-year-old former Christian of Eritrean origin converted to Islam as a teenager . Al-Habashi, from north London, was of Eritrean origin and converted from Christianity to Islam during his teenage years. He is understood to have travelled from the UK to join the Islamic State in Syria in December 2013. Abu Dharda, from west London, came from a British-Somali background and travelled to Syria via Turkey in the same month as al-Habashi. Neither death has been independently verified. Their families could not be contacted and police said they could not comment. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said they were aware of the reports but that it was extremely difficult to get confirmation of deaths of injuries, due to UK consular services being suspended. Al-Habashi was a well known and popular figure in Islamic State due to his media appearances. In August, he was interviewed on BBC Newsnight, where he admitted that his family had been trying to persuade him to return home but he had insisted there was 'no going back.' He confidently says in the interview: 'They say what all parents would say, 'come back you're crazy etc.' But I'm here for the sake of Allah.' Threat: In his video appearance last month, al-Habashi gesticulated wildly as he said 'We will chop off the heads of the Americans, chop off the heads of the French, chop off the heads of whoever you may bring' Location Abu Abdullah is believed to have been killed fighting for ISIS in the Syrian city of Kobane (pictured) The United States and its allies have staged 30 air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq since Wednesday, the U.S. Central Command said on Friday. The 23 strikes in Iraq included six near Baiji that hit Islamic State buildings, vehicles and tactical units while buildings, vehicles, a guard post and two tactical units were destroyed near Sinjar in four air strikes, Central Command said. Similar targets were destroyed or damaged west of Kirkuk, near Mosul and Ramadi and in Tal Afar. In Syria, six strikes near Kobani destroyed staging areas, buildings and two tactical units, while another near Ar Raqqah damaged an Islamic State barrack, Central Command said. The British fighter also told Newsnight that he had been fighting with Islamic State in Ramadi, Iraq. He described it as 'the best fighting and the hardest fighting' and that 'US-made weapons was the war booty.' Last month, the British fighter appeared alongside a German and a French ISIS fighter in the IS video, 'Wait. We are also waiting.' In the video, Abu Abdullah describes the West as being full of 'puppets and apostates'. He declares: 'We are waiting for you in Dabiq. We are waiting for you in Iraq so bring your coalition of unbelievers because unbelievers will not help you. We will take their weaponry as booty and these people will die.' The British jihadist vows that all Islamic State fighters 'are willing to lay down our blood on this soil. So try. Try to come and we will kill every single soldier.' 'We will chop off the heads of the Americans. We will chop off the heads of the French, chop of the heads of whoever you may bring.' He even promised that the black flag of the Islamic State will 'eventually be on the White House.' Al-Habashi also appeared in another IS video, entitled 'Eid Greetings from the Land of the Khilafah.' The video, released in August, featured the British fighter alongside fighters from Finland and America. Sick: Abu Abdullah al-Habashi made headlines in August when he posed next to a decapitated Syrian soldier . Militant: Al-Habashi was a well known and popular figure in Islamic State due to his media appearances . In the video, the Londoner glorifies life under the Islamic State: 'I don't think there is anything better than living in land of the Khilafah.' 'You know the rights and you are not living under oppression. You are not living under rule. You are not living under the kufr [non-believer]. You are living by the Koran and by the Su'rah. 'As Muslims, that's what we want and that's what we need. We don't need any democracy, we don't need any communism, we don't need anything like that. All we need is Sharia. Abu Abdullah al-Habashi also made headlines for a photo showing him posing next to a decapitated Syrian soldier. The photo shows al-Habashi proudly smiling next to the victim, who was tied up and beheaded. Meanwhile, a tweet on November 7 believed to be from the account belonging to Abu Dharda warned there would be 'more bloodshed' in Kobane. The tweet said: 'There are hundreds of pkk dead from Kobane battles so far but inshallah soon those hundreds will turn to thousands.. expect more bloodshed.' According to the BBC, Dharda was believed to have been questioned by counter-terrorism police at a British airport as he travelled towards Syria. But he was allowed to continue his journey because officers were satisfied with the explanation he gave for the purpose of his trip.","British man known as Abu Abdullah al-Habashi killed fighting in Kobane .

"The Colorado teen accused of murdering a newlywed soldier and his pregnant wife was found guilty Tuesday following a 12-day trial, officials report. Macyo Joelle January, 19,  was found guilty of murdering Staff Sgt. David Dunlap, 37, and his pregnant wife Whitney Butler, 35,  after the two walked in on him burglarizing their Colorado Springs home Jan. 14, 2013. Police say that the newlyweds arrived home separately to check on the alarm that went off at 11.10am. Shot: Sgt. David Dunlap, 37,  and his pregnant wife, 35, Whitney Butler were both fatally shot from behind Jan. 14, 2013 . Family: In the courtroom, Maryln Dunlap (front, right) -- Sgt. David Dunlap's mother -- wept inconsolably while, just feet away, January smiled and hugged his attorneys following the verdict . Dunlap and Butler were both shot from behind as they walked through the front door. Officials say evidence suggests that Butler was shot in the head as she leaned over her husband's dead body, according to The Gazette. A jury deliberated for three-and-a-half hours and the case that went on for 1 1/2 years -- overlapping what would have been the couple's two-year anniversary -- ended with January being found guilty of the slayings. January will be sentenced Oct. 22. He is being sentenced as an adult which means he will face life in prison, however, because he was 17 at the time of the double-murder, there is chance for parole after 40 years, The Gazette reports. January was also convicted of burglary, theft, and aggravated motor vehicle theft. There was no murder charge for the 13-week-old fetus Butler carried the day she died, in accordance with state laws, authorities say. The Gazette reported that January showed no emotion when the jury unanimously found him guilty in front of 4th Judicial District Court Judge Deborah Grohs. In the courtroom, Maryln Dunlap -- Sgt. David Dunlap's mother -- wept inconsolably while, just feet away, January reportedly smiled and hugged his attorneys following the verdict. Pregnant: There was no murder charge for the 13-week-old fetus Butler carried the day she died, in accordance with state laws, authorities say. Never forgotten: Marie Butler said her daughter and son-in-law would not be forgotten and that she would not let their murders make her bitter, vengeful, or hateful . Juror Cornelia Sistrunk told The Gazette that she was confident that the jury weighed all of the testimony and evidence. 'As far as I'm concerned as a juror,' Sistrunk said, 'it came down to five things for me: the gun, the bullet, the fingerprint, the DNA, and the confessions.' The parent's of the couple told KKTV that they feel a sense of  justice now that January has been convicted. Just months after the murder of her daughter, Marie Butler referred to the deaths as a 'parent's worst nightmare' as she told The Gazette, 'I don't know if I will ever be able to wrap my hands around it.' Now, just days after the verdict, Butler said she would honor the couple's memory by not 'letting it make us bitter or vengeful or hateful.' 'These people will not be forgotten,' Butler said.

"Die-ins have been staged in New York and Washington D.C. as demonstrations against police brutality and racism entered the fourth day. Hundreds gathered in Grand Central and Union Station while Eric Garner's widow, Esaw, issued a rallying cry to the protesters to 'keep fight for what's right'. Speaking at the National Action Network's headquarters in Harlem, New York, alongside Al Sharpton and Spike Lee, she said: 'I just want to thank each and every person that's out there marching. 'Just keep fighting. Keep fighting for what's right, to get justice.' After lying on the ground for a short time, the protesters in both stations got up to carry on marching around the cities. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of protesters gathered at Grand Central station in New York to stage a die-in . A crowd also gathered at Union Station in Washington D.C. as country-wide demonstrations against police brutality and racism entered the fourth day . Many help up placards saying 'I can't breathe' as travelers walked around them . Esaw Garner, Eric's widow, has issued a rallying cry to the demonstrators urging them to 'keep fighting for what is right' The chokehold victim's mother Gwen Carr was also at the meeting held at the National Action Network's headquarters in Harlem, New York City . According to the New York Daily News, Mrs Garner experienced the protests up close - one when they walked outside of her window and another time when they blocked her car. She said: 'My son woke me up out my sleep and said, 'Ma, look out the window there's like a thousand people on the street. 'I see all these people and they're yelling out, 'Eric Garner,' and everything and I'm just like overwhelmed.' Spike Lee announced that there would be a march on Washington D.C. next week against the recent cases of alleged police brutality. As he walked on staged the crowd erupted in applause. Protests are expected to continue in New York after the funeral of a black man who was unarmed when he was shot dead by a police officer in a darkened stairwell of a Brooklyn apartment building. The shooting of Akai Gurley, 28, by a New York city police officer at a city housing project last month is the latest in a series of incidents fueling public outrage over what many see as a pattern of callous misuse of lethal force against minority groups. Al Sharpton and Spike Lee were also at the news conference days after a Grand Jury decided not to indict the officer involved in Garner's death . The district attorney in the New York City borough of Brooklyn said on Friday a grand jury would consider charges against Peter Liang, the officer who shot Gurley. Police have said Liang may have accidentally discharged his gun. Gurley was eulogized on the morning after a cold, drenching rain helped tame protests in New York on Friday. On Friday night hundreds of people gathered at various locations in New York - and elsewhere across the United States - to denounce the use of deadly force against minorities, which they believe to be motivated attacks under the guise of control. More than one hundred people stormed into an Apple Store on Central Park South and Fifth Avenue to stage a brief 'die-in,' sprawling on the floor of the crowded showroom as shoppers and employees watched. Many also blocked the FDR Drive, one of the main arteries around the city. 'The protests remained very peaceful throughout the night,' said Detective Michael DeBonis, a spokesman for the New York Police Department. It was a brief departure from the peaceful rallies of the previous two night and the group left without incident after about five minutes. Day three: Hundreds of protesters brought New York's Apple store on Fifth Avenue to a standstill on Friday . Similar demonstrations were staged at Macy's flagship department store in Herald Square and at Grand Central Terminal, one of the city's two main rail stations. garner . Police stood by but allowed the protesters to briefly occupy both locations. Some stores in midtown Manhattan shut early in response to the recent unrest. Representatives of Best Buy Co Inc and Target Corp said the companies had temporarily closed stores early as a precaution. Meanwhile, nearly 100 people, including local civic leaders, huddled under umbrellas near the site of Garner's death for a candlelight vigil on Staten Island. 'This is a movement, a rainbow of people,' the Rev. Demetrius Carolina of the First Central Baptist Church told the racially mixed crowd. Blocked off: Police handcuff demonstrators who walked onto the FDR Drive in Manhattan and stopped cars . Operation: A number of white zip ties lie on the ground as NYPD detain one of those involved in the protests . Unrest: The crowds held up signs and shouted chants about alleged police racism in New York and the US . With their hands up, in reference to slain black teenager Michael Brown, they chanted 'black lives matter' It is the third day of unrest after a jury refused to indict a white NYPD officer over the death of a black man . Some stores in New York's Manhattan closed early as hundreds swarmed through the rain-soaked streets . Die-ins were staged in Apple and Macy's as the family of shot black man Akai Gurley staged his funeral . The Staten Island grand jury's decision came amid a wave of anger over similar cases across the US . Surrounding the Christmas tree in Bryant Park, Manhattan, protesters staged another die-in, holding signs . In Chicago, protesters paused for a moment of silence, as a siren could be heard wailing nearby. Renee Alexander, 44, a nurse from Woodbridge, Virginia, who joined about 200 protesters in downtown Washington, expressed outrage over the images of Garner's death, captured in the video widely shown on television and the Internet. 'It's heartbreaking for me to watch, over and over on TV, how his life was cut short on the street, just like a dog,' she said. 'They had no respect for him. No human being should die in the street like that - choked to death.' Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said on Friday he will convene a grand jury to consider charges against the New York City officer who shot Gurley. Police there have said the officer, Peter Liang, may have accidentally discharged his gun. At a news conference with Gurley's relatives on Friday, Kevin Powell, the president of the advocacy group BK Nation, called the shooting part of a 'series of modern-day lynchings.' Gurley's mother, Sylvia Palmer, tearfully demanded justice for her son. A wake for Gurley was scheduled for Friday night, with his funeral to follow on Saturday. Elsewhere: Meanwhile, demonstrators marched in front of the national guard in Ferguson, Missouri . Solidarity: Demonstrations were also held in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on Friday in memory of Eric Garner . People lay on the ground of the University of Michigan Law Library in support of the national movement . In Cleveland on Friday, the family of a 12-year-old boy fatally shot by police filed a lawsuit against the city, a day after the federal government found the police department systematically uses excessive force. New York police have taken a soft approach to crowd control during this week's protests, generally allowing marchers to proceed unhindered as long as they remained peaceful. Halfway across the country, activists on Friday concluded a 120-mile protest march to the Missouri governor's mansion from Ferguson, where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot to death in August by a policeman who initially stopped the teenager for walking in the street. Some witnesses to the confrontation told a grand jury that Brown had raised his hands in the air before he was killed, though others contradicted that testimony. More than 100 protesters shouted, 'hands up, don't shoot' and other slogans as they rallied in the rotunda of the state capitol in Jefferson City. Mourning: The family of Akai Gurley, who was shot dead by a cop on patrol last month, mourn at his wake . Tragic: Gurley, 28, was killed as he left his girlfriend's apartment block in Brooklyn where the cop patrolled . Tears: Members of his family embrace in the pews at Brown Memorial Baptist Church in New York on Friday . Unlike the August 9 slaying of Brown, Garner's encounter was captured on video. Pantaleo could still face disciplinary action from an internal police investigation, his lawyer said. Chokeholds are banned by police department regulations. Pantaleo told the grand jury he used a proper takedown technique and denied putting pressure on Garner's neck, according to his lawyer, Stuart London. The city's medical examiner has said Garner's death was caused by compressing his neck and chest, with his asthma and obesity contributing. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said the Justice Department will pursue civil rights investigations into both the Missouri shooting and the New York case, though legal experts have said federal charges for the two officers are unlikely.","Hundreds lay on the floors of Grand Central and Union Stations .

"Cristiano Ronaldo brought the house down with another one-man show at the Santiago Bernabeu and there was even some first-half theatre as he dived for a penalty, which of course he converted in Real’s 3-0 win over Celta. The Real Madrid striker has now scored 200 league goals in 178 games; has netted more hat-tricks, 23 in the league, than any player in La Liga history; and is on a run of scoring in his last 17 home league matches. He is now scoring at a rate nearly two goals a game in the league – 23 in 13 matches. It would be churlish to dwell to long on the nature of the first goal but a dive is a dive even when it’s Ronaldo. VIDEO Scroll down to see Sportsmail's big match stats: Real Madrid 3-0 Celta Vigo .

Booked: Cabral, Jonny, Nolito, Hernandez . Full-back Jonny Castro applied the slightest of touches to Ronaldo’s back as they both chased a Marcelo cross. There was no push from the defender but as the ball went beyond Ronaldo he dropped to the turf and referee Alberto Undiano pointed to the spot.The full-back was booked, as was forward Nolito, as Celta players surrounded the referee. Ronaldo coolly dispatched the spot-kick. It was his seventh penalty of the season. The only other player to score as many spot-kicks at this stage of the campaign was current Southampton manager Ronald Koeman in his Barcelona days. His first goal might have been unjust but it was only fair that Real went in at half time with the advantage having dominated the first 45 minutes. Celta Vigo had named the same team that beat Barcelona 1-0 a month ago but were under pressure from the start. Real should have taken the lead when Ronaldo headed goalwards, Celta Vigo keeper Sergio Alvarez pushed the ball out to Ramos, and he blasted wide from four yards out. Then Ronaldo had the ball taken off of his toe by full-back Jonny just as he was going to convert James Rodriguez’ cross and Gareth Bale joined the fun cutting in from the right but shooting straight at Alvarez. Ronaldo then bicycle-kicked onto the roof of the net with what would have been a sensational way to break the deadlock even by his standards. Alvarez pushed a Ronaldo shot around the post after the forward ran onto a long ball forward from Marcelo, and the keeper then held a shot from Rodriguez after he’d connected with a Ronaldo cross.

He hobbled off with five minutes left with an ankle knock and Rodriguez also went down with a calf injury and was immediately replaced by Arbeloa. Madrid will now wait anxiously for test results on both players – they are already without Luka Modric for the next two and a half months. Only injuries can derail this Ronaldo-inspired Madrid team.

In a massive tent in an open field in the capital Harare, Mugabe told about 12,000 members of the ruling Zanu-PF party that his spies had followed Vice President Joice Mujuru to the U.S. embassy, where he said she held secret meetings to plan his assassination.

The party congress re-elected the 90-year-old Mugabe to another five-year term as party president and authorized him to personally choose his vice president and other top party posts. 'I am open to competition, but not when it involves taking me out the Kabila way,' said Mugabe, referring to the former leader of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Laurent Kabila, who was assassinated by one of his bodyguards in 2001. Mujuru, once a freedom fighter in Mugabe's guerrilla army known by the nom de guerre 'Spill Blood' in the local Shona language, is now a political outcast accused of conspiring with witches and foreign agents to remove the president. 'I met Joice when she was a young kid in the war,' he said. 'I strengthened her and even pushed her to get an education until she got a doctorate.' Mrs Joyce Mujuru, who has previously denied the allegations, had been seen as a potential successor to Mr Mugabe, with whom she fought for Zimbabwe's independence from white-minority rule . Joyce Mujuru's career ran into trouble when Mrs Mugabe entered into politics this year, and accused her of plotting against her husband. Mujuru, who became a member of cabinet at the age of 25 when Mugabe was elected president in 1980, was removed as the party's vice president during the congress. Mugabe said his wife, Grace Mugabe, pushed him to appoint Mujuru as vice president in 2004. Mugabe said he plans to announce Mujuru's successor later this week and assured a cheering crowd that the vice president and her allies, including spokesman Rugare Gumbo, who was also suspended, will not be considered. 'There will be disappointments,' he said. A front-runner is Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa, who suffered the same treatment as Mujuru a decade ago but is back in favor. Mujuru remains vice president of Zimbabwe, as Mugabe will need parliament's approval to remover her from government. She did not attend the party meeting. Zimbabwe's president has spoken of his anger that his embattled deputy Joyce Mujuru allegedly plotted to assassinate him and accused her of being a thief . Speaking at the ruling Zanu-PF party's congress, Robert Mugabe said he would act against all corrupt officials .","Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has accused his vice president of plotting with the United States Embassy in the country to remove him .

"President Barack Obama has admitted that global crises such as Ebola, ISIS and Russian aggression have made the world spin so fast, nobody is able to control it. The president made the remarks at a Democratic National Convention fund-raiser in New York City yesterday but added that America is proud to bear the brunt of these problems. His comments come as the U.S. continue airstrikes on ISIS militants in Syria and Iraq and California congressman Duncan Hunter claims 'at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas'. President Barack Obama pictured leaving the White House for New York City yesterday. At a fund-raiser in the city he told Democrats it seems that the world is spinning so fast . Just yesterday General Martin Dempsey, who chairs the military Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the US and its allies were finding it more and more difficult to track the increasingly technologically adept ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria. Meanwhile the president is also facing the threat of the deadly Ebola virus on US soil as fears of the spread of the condition continue to grow. Thomas Duncan from San Angelo, Texas became the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States after recently travelling to Liberia and is currently receiving treatment in a Dallas hospital. It was also announced yesterday that $750million would be spent so the US military can construct treatment facilities in Ebola stricken countries. This prompted the president to tell fellow Democrats gathered at the White Street Restaurant that times are uncertain due to all the changes taking place across the globe. The presidents comments on ISIS come after the U.S. continued airstrikes against suspected militants in Syria and Iraq . The president added that is was the U.S. who first mobilized a coalition to stand up to ISIS. Pictured are suspected Islamic State militants raise their flag on a hill near the Syrian town of Kobane . According to a Weekly Standard blog, he said: 'Understandably, when you see the headlines every single day and you read about ISIS and Ebola and the Russian incursions into Ukraine, there’s a sense possibly that the world is spinning so fast and nobody is able to control it.' However, he followed up his claim by saying that it was it was the United States who are leading the way in trying to respond to these problems. He told of how it was America that mobilized a coalition to take a stand against ISIS in the Middle East and that they are also at the forefront of improving health infrastructure in Ebola stricken West Africa. Mr Obama also alluded to the Ukraine conflict saying it was the United States, who encouraged the world community to take a stand against Russian aggression.

The president said America is at the forefront of improving health infrastructure in West Africa to try and stop the spread of the deadly virus . A U.S. Navy microbiologist tests blood samples for Ebola at a lab in central Liberia. It was announced yesterday that $750million would be spent so the US military can construct treatment facilities in Ebola stricken countries . It comes as after claims pro-Russian separatists used tanks, artillery systems and rocket launchers in their fight to capture the airport in the rebel-held Ukrainian city of Donetsk yesterday. Mr Obama added: 'But in the end, it's a burden that we bear proudly because it's part of what makes us American, and it's part of what that lady with the torch in the middle of the water means. 'It's part of what attracts people from every corner of the globe to this country, understanding that for all our flaws there’s something essential that we stand for that nobody else does, and we're willing to put our money and time and effort and resources and occasionally our lives on behalf of that.' The president's speech comes as some Americans have become disillusioned with the president's response to global issues. Meanwhile it was only earlier this week that the president made his first public comments on Ebola when he explained that the government had an 'all-hands-on-deck approach' to stopping a pandemic, but insisted that 'the chances of an outbreak, of an epidemic here are extraordinarily low.'","Obama admits that ISIS, Ebola and Russian aggression are global crises .

"Jose Pozo only made his Premier League debut for Manchester City when he came on as a late substitute in the 4-1 win against Sunderland on Wednesday. But manager Manuel Pellegrini put his faith in the 18-year-old when he replaced the injured Sergio Aguero in the opening minutes of Saturday's clash with Everton. Aguero had left the field in tears after appearing to injure his thigh in the second minute of the match at the Etihad and Pozo was unexpectedly thrust into the action. Click here to get all the stats from the match with Sportsmail's brilliant Match Zone . Jose Pozo was brought on in the opening minutes after Sergio Aguero injured his knee . Pozo's stats from the match against Everton . Pellegrini turned to the Spain youth international ahead of proven Premier League goalscorer Edin Dzeko, to fill the void left by the club's leading scorer. The talented Pozo was forced to play down comparisons with Barcelona star Lionel Messi earlier in the season after scoring on his first-team debut in a 7-0 win against Sheffield Wednesday in September. His performances for Manchester City's youth side have earned him rave reviews but against experienced defenders in Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin it was always going to be a tough ask for the former Real Mardrid youngster. He struggled to make his mark on the game before being substituted in the 64th minute. Pozo only made eight passes during his time on the pitch - but did manage to complete them all, and showed his work rate from the front as he recovered possession three times for his side. Jose Pozo's half-time heat map shows he struggled to get into the game against Everton . While he was a willing runner and showed intelligent movement, particularly when he darted to the near post to meet a low cross, only to see his effort blocked by Distin's outstretched leg, Pozo struggled to impose himself on the first half, which City led 1-0 after Yaya Toure's penalty. Pozo's half-time heat map (above) illustrates how the young striker found it difficult to get on the ball in the opening 45 minutes of a tight match. Shortly into the second half Pozo had a chance to double the home side's lead, but was thwarted by the legs of Tim Howard in the Everton goal. The diminutive star cleverly made space for himself in the box and was picked out James Milner's pinpoint cut-back from the City left. Pozo made a good contact with the first time shot from 12 yards, but Howard's reactions were equal to the strike. The forward slumped to his knees after Tim Howard saved his only chance of the match . The missed opportunity was to be the forward's last involvement in the game. With Everton building second-half momentum, thanks largely to the introduction of Ross Barkley, Pellegrini opted to replace Pozo with the more experienced and bigger framed Dzeko. The Bosnian's introduction allowed City to hold possession up front and bring the likes of Samir Nasri and Yaya Toure in to play, as he did when he set up Milner superbly with a cushioned header, only for the midfielder to lash his strike high and wide. While Pozo showed glimpses of his talents with his intelligent movement, a Premier League clash against a very good Everton team looked a step too far for the 18-year-old.","Jose Pozo replaced Sergio Aguero in the sixth minute against Everton .

"Mourners heard a rallying cry for justice Saturday at the New York funeral of an unarmed black man shot dead by police amid a wave of nationwide protests against similar killings. Akai Gurley, 28, a father of a young daughter, was shot dead when a police officer opened fire in a dimly lit staircase at a Brooklyn apartment building as he walked with his girlfriend late on November 20. Friends and relatives filed past Gurley's open casket to pay their respects at the Brown Memorial Baptist Church, before the lid was closed and a huge spray of red and white flowers placed on top of the gray coffin. Gurley, whose mother lived in Florida, had been planning a surprise Thanksgiving trip to introduce her to his young daughter last month when he was killed. Scroll down for video .

Activist Kevin Powell, who delivered the eulogy, thanked Mayor Bill de Blasio and the city of New York for covering the costs of the funeral and issued a passionate rallying cry for change. 'Akai was innocent, innocent, innocent,' he told the mourners. 'This is modern-day lynchings, over and over again. Akai Gurley was simply the latest victim of this,' he said, calling for homicide charges to be brought. He demanded police reform and spoke of the recent protests that have mobilized thousands of people across the United States to denounce a spate of killings of unarmed black men by white police officers, sparked by the shooting of Missouri teen Michael Brown and followed by the chokehold death of New York man Eric Garner. 'Let's do everything we can to prevent any more situations like this,' Powell said. Rev. Clinton Miller echoed the same call, saying that clergy and activists would work together to ensure that justice would prevail. 'We ask that you would allow brother Akai's name to live forever in our hearts as we continue to fight for what's right in this country and this world,' he said. 'We will all work together to pursue justice.' The Brooklyn district attorney announced Friday that a grand jury would consider charges in one of the cases that has again brought to the fore the distrust felt by many African Americans towards the police. Saturday's funeral included music from gospel singers, accompanied by a drummer and keyboard player, as well as the reading of a poem by Gurley's sobbing young brother, comforted by a relative.

A video montage of his life was shown from when he was a toddler to a proud father carrying his young daughter and pointing to the camera grinning. A handful of elected officials, including New York City Public Advocate Letitia James, and various activists also attended the ceremony. Brooklyn district attorney Ken Thompson said he would present all the evidence for a grand jury to decide whether charges should be brought. 'I pledge to conduct a full and fair investigation and to give the grand jury all of the information necessary to do its job,' he said. New York's police commissioner has said Gurley was a totally innocent victim. Notably absent from the funeral was Rev Al Sharpton, who Gurley's family had accused of implanting himself into the arrangements for his own benefit. Gurley’s aunt, Hertencia Petersen - speaking on behalf of the man's mother, Sylvia Palmer - said the outspoken civil rights activist has been nothing but opportunistic over Gurley's death, seeing it as a political play when his family just want to lay him to rest. 'It’s been a nightmare,' Mrs Petersen told The New York Post. 'He just wants to take credit for this when he’s never even contacted my sister (Gurley’s mother). 'Who made you the spokesperson of our family? We just want to bury our nephew with dignity and respect.' Mrs Petersen further told TMZ: '(All Shapton sees) is money and political gain and that he is turning the tragedy into a circus.' Sharpton claims he was asked to speak at Gurley's memorial in Brooklyn on Friday night by Kimberly Ballinger, the shooting victim’s domestic partner and mother of his two-year-old daughter. However he pulled out of the service, citing 'confusion'.

Protests continued on Saturday with Sharpton's National Action Network holding an event in Harlem attended by actor Spike Lee. On Friday, thousands of demonstrators marched in US cities for a third consecutive night to condemn a grand jury decision not to charge the white officer in the July 17 chokehold death of black father-of-six Eric Garner in New York. New York protesters shouted 'I can't breathe' -- the final words gasped by the 43-year-old man who police wrestled to the ground in New York's Staten Island for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes. A coroner's report ruled Garner's death a 'homicide' after police held him in a chokehold. Similar protests after a grand jury decision not to prosecute the white officer who shot dead unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9 triggered riots as well as peaceful protests. On Friday, demonstrators staged 'die-ins,' by lying on the ground at Columbia University, Grand Central Station and after pouring into Macy's flagship store in Herald Square and the Apple store on Fifth Avenue .

"Goals from Andrew Surman and Ryan Fraser gave new Sky Bet Championship leaders Bournemouth a 2-0 victory at Sheffield Wednesday that extended their winning run to seven games. Following a fairly even first 45 minutes, the turning point came in the 60th minute when Wednesday's Royston Drenthe was dismissed after receiving a second yellow card. Surman and Fraser scored soon afterwards and the hosts never threatened to mount a comeback. Ryan Fraser (right) celebrates scoring Bournemouth's second in their 2-0 win at Sheffield Wednesday . Sheffield Wednesday: Westwood, Palmer, Lees, Loovens, Helan, Drenthe, Lee (Dielna 78), Maguire (May 67), Coke, Maghoma, Nuhiu. Subs not used: Semedo, Taylor-Fletcher, McCabe, Young, Kirkland. Booked: Maguire, Drenthe . Sent off: Drenthe 60 . Bournemouth: Boruc, Francis, Elphick, Cook, Daniels, Ritchie (Fraser 67), Arter, Surman, Pugh, Pitman (Kermorgant 66), Wilson (Rantie 87). Subs not used: Camp, Gosling, Harte, Smith. Goals: Surman 65, Fraser 69 . Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral) Attendance: 16,881 . Drenthe was in the thick of the action early on, firstly seeing his 20-yard effort comfortably saved by Artur Boruc and then having a defected long-range shot kept out by the visiting keeper. The home side continued to have the better of the opening exchanges with Giles Coke's long-range shot deflected wide and Jacques Maghoma trying an effort from distance which was saved. Coke also headed wide before Bournemouth enjoyed a good spell. The Cherries' first real opening came when Simon Francis' low cross found Callum Wilson whose shot was saved by Keiren Westwood, with the keeper gathering the ball at the second attempt. Marc Pugh then put a rising shot over while Matt Ritchie had a low shot saved. Maghoma put a fierce shot off-target before the visitors threatened again. Wilson found himself in space inside the area and will have been disappointed to have screwed his shot wide. Ritchie then tested Westwood with a firm drive which was well saved by the keeper, who dived to his left to turn the ball wide. The hosts were down to 10 men when Royston Drenthe (left) was sent off for a second yellow on the hour mark . Wilson wasted another good opportunity when he missed the target from a good position inside the area after Brett Pitman ran at the heart of the defence and slipped the ball to him. Wednesday were reduced to 10 men on the hour mark when Drenthe was shown the red card after picking up his second booking for a foul. Bournemouth soon made the numerical advantage count when Wilson found Surman, who picked his spot to score with a measured finish. The visitors went further ahead four minutes later when Westwood was left exposed by his defence and Wilson squared to substitute Fraser who scored with ease. Andrew Surman (left) put the Cherries ahead with a left-footed strike on 65 minutes . The Wednesday players wilted after the second goal went in and posed no problems for the Bournemouth rear-guard. Cherries substitute Yann Kermorgant had a late chance to make the victory more comprehensive, but he shot well over the bar. Bournemouth's impressive recent run continues with just one defeat in their last 10 games. Wednesday, meanwhile, have now gone eight games without a win.","Andrew Surman gave the visitors the lead on 65 minutes .

"Maybe there is something in the water, because Harrogate has been named the happiest place in Britain. Residents of the North Yorkshire spa town are the most satisfied with where they live, a study has found. Researchers asked nearly 40,000 homeowners how they felt about the safety and neighbourliness of their area and the size and condition of their property, among 12 measurements of happiness. The town famous for ‘healing’ mineral waters came top, followed by Stockport, Ipswich and Exeter. Happy: Residents of North Yorkshire spa town Harrogate are the most satisfied with where they live, a study has found . Friendly town: Harrogate won out overall after scoring on safety, recreation and the friendliness of neighbours . The survey by property website Rightmove found Northerners were generally happier about where they lived than those in the South. Nine of the ten unhappiest places were in Greater London. East London was given the lowest scores, followed by Croydon, east central London and Ilford. Dudley in the West Midlands was the only area outside London to appear in the bottom ten of the site’s ‘Happy At Home’ Index. Lincoln was the most house-proud town, while Hereford was safest. Swansea residents were the happiest in Wales, and Aberdeen came top of the list in Scotland. Picturesque: West Park stray in Harrogate - the town has a population of around 75,000 . Stunning: Knaresborough is an old and historic market town, spa town and civil parish in the Borough of Harrogate . Harrogate won out overall after scoring on safety, recreation and the friendliness of neighbours. Average asking prices for houses in the town are up 5.6 per cent year on year, outperforming the national average of 1.2 per cent. Rightmove director Miles Shipside said: ‘Harrogate’s position demonstrates the complex web of factors  that makes for a happy place to live. ‘As a nation obsessed with  property, our homes represent far more than simple bricks and mortar. ‘What elevates a house to a home is an often complicated relationship of the physical property itself,  the emotional sense of well-being it provides and how safe and socially rooted we feel.’ Mr Shipside believes London scores poorly because living space is at a premium in the capital, and as a result of safety fears. He said: ‘Among reasons why London was marked down are topics that may be considered as sacrifices when living in a major city, such as the amount of space to live comfortably and safety.’ Nice: Stockport was the second happiest town in the UK according to the poll.

"John Travolta's former pilot has hit out at the Saturday Night Fever star for accusing him of 'wanting money' in a pending lawsuit between the pair. Doug Gotterba - who claims he had a six-year gay affair with Travolta when he worked for him in the 1980s - released a statement to MailOnline refuting Travolta's comments. In an interview with The Daily Beast this week Travolta, 60, was asked about the pending lawsuit with Gotterba, to which he replied: 'This is every celebrity's achilles heel. It's just about people wanting money. That's all. It happens on many levels.' Scroll down for video . Lawsuit pending: Douglas Gotterba has sued superstar JohnTravolta to determine if a confidentiality agreement covering his employment was valid. Gotterba wants to write a book . Responding to Travolta's comments, Gotterba said: 'What John Travolta said about me in a recent . interview is an inaccurate description of what our court case is about. 'Our dispute is purely about declaratory relief and will be a non-monetary judgement. This is about the truth and my right for a court to decide who is telling the truth, not for Mr Travolta to make a judgement.' However, MailOnline has learned that according to Travolta's representative, Gotterba had asked for $10 million to settle the case out of court. Gotterba was a pilot for Travolta's aircraft company Alto for six years before leaving voluntarily in 1987. The . former pilot alleges he and Travolta enjoyed a sexual relationship when . he was under his employment and the pair are currently disputing . whether Gotterba signed a confidentiality agreement. Last July, a California appeals court ruled that Gotterba would be able to argue his case that he does not have a confidentiality agreement with Travolta. When Gotterba left the actor's Alto airline company in 1987, he entered into a written termination agreement. Gotterba decided to 'tell the story of his life and those involved in it', including his personal relationship with Travolta after he was 'unwillingly thrust' into the spotlight when another former Travolta employee spilled the beans about their purported gay relationship. Hollywood star: John Travolta, shown last week at the Toronto International Film Festival, opened up about a lawsuit filed by his former pilot . When Travolta’s attorney learned that . Gotterba was planning to write a book, the pilot was warned that he would . be breaching a confidentiality provision of the termination agreement. But the pilot asserted the agreement was ‘not authentic.’ It was an . earlier draft that he did not agree to, he said. He . filed suit against Travolta, asking the court to decide about the . validity of the agreement and the validity of the confidentiality . clause. Speaking about the fact he has been subject to several allegations from supposed former lovers in the past, Travolta . told the Daily Beast: 'Also, I don't care that much about it. Other . people may attack it back more than I do, but I let all the media stuff . go a long time ago because I can't control it I think that's why it . persists, to some degree.' The star was dogged by gay rumors two years ago when an anonymous masseur sued him claiming sexual assault and battery and another masseur joined the lawsuit. Both lawsuits were ultimately dropped by the masseurs. Travolta said he has come to terms with being the target of such allegations. 'Also, I don't care that much about it. Other people may attack it back more than I do, but I let all the media stuff go a long time ago because I can't control it. I think that's why it persists to some degree,' the actor said. Travolta's autistic teenage son Jett died in 2009 after suffering a seizure while on a Christmas vacation in The Bahamas and the star said he was disturbed by some of the media coverage. Too low: Travolta's daughter Ella, wife Kelly Preston and late son Jett are shown in an undated file photo . Longtime couple: Kelly Preston and Travolta, shown in August at a Church Of Scientology gala in Los Angeles, have been married since 1991 . 'I found it most offensive with the . loss of my son. I felt like that was the lowest I'd ever felt. Sex stuff . is always going to be interesting to somebody, but you stay away from . family. You really should. With that, I always felt like the media - not . all of the media, but part of it - went too low there,' he said. The Pulp Fiction star opened up while at the Toronto International Film Festival for his new film The Forger. He . portrays a second-generation art forger who agrees to take on a job . with his father, played by 84-year-old Christopher Plummer, in order to . spend time with his dying son.","John Travolta insists that money is the motivation behind a lawsuit filed by his former airline pilot .

"Arsenal supporters are the latest to confirm their opposition to the idea of taking Barclays Premier League games overseas after Chelsea fans also revealed their disapproval at the proposal. The plan has crept back on to the agenda, six years after it was first mooted and rejected in the face of intense criticism, with a few slight alterations, such as taking one of the original 38 games abroad, rather than adding a 39th. Fans in the Chelsea Supporters Trust were quick to register their disapproval of the new proposal and they have been joined by Arsenal's Black Scarf Movement (BSM). Arsenal fans at Stamford Bridge - some supporters voiced concerns over Premier League games overseas . 'The integrity of English football is at risk,' said a BSM statement. 'As ever it seems as if those at the top are focused purely on short-term cash over the long-term interests of the game. 'With clubs continually pressing the loyal, match-going support for more and more money - despite the huge amounts now coming into the game from commercial and television contracts - it is important that those running our clubs, and the FA, see sense in this matter. 'The English football leagues are loved across the globe. As the country which brought the beautiful game to the world, we have a long standing history of passionate, honest competition that has received millions of admirers at home and abroad, over many years. Arsenal fans have joined their Chelsea counterparts in opposing the proposal to play PL matches abroad . 'This integrity will be shattered if the Premier League is allowed to ratify competitive matches overseas, which are designed purely as a money making exercise. 'In the interests of fair competition we also question how the idea of a 38th match overseas will work. Playing one round of competitive matches at neutral venues will mean one less home match for at least 10 Premier League teams, and with that there is the loss of advantage in home support. Does that really work in the interests of fair play?' Supporters are also concerned about the knock-on effect on ticket prices and the increasing trends to accommodate corporate interests, television and far-flung fan-bases which are draining atmosphere from English grounds. Chelsea fans waiting outside Stamford Bridge for the team bus to arrive ahead of the Arsenal game . 'It should never be forgotten that match-going fans are the life and soul of our game,' the BSM statement continued. 'We appreciate that monster commercial and television contracts have ensured the Premier League and its clubs are rolling in cash and that there is less reliance on income from ticket sales, but without the attendance and passion of the fans at matches, the Premier League would have no brand to sell. 'While it's fantastic that the Premier League has acquired millions of new fans across the globe, the idea of playing a round of matches abroad and the associated issues that come with it, could be disastrous. 'Let alone the immorality of tweaking the competition's rules purely as a means to bring in even more cash, with the complexity and problems that overseas matches could bring, certain clubs also stand to lose millions of pounds bearing in mind one decision or a single goal under enforced different circumstances could mean missing out on European qualification, or relegation.' Arsenal have plenty of supporters overseas, including these Gooners in Malaysia . The Chelsea Supporters Trust statement was along similar lines: 'The Chelsea Supporters Trust board notes with deep concern the re-emergence in the media of the ‘overseas Premier League game’ idea. We see this concept as fundamentally flawed for a number of reasons and oppose its introduction to top flight football in England. 'The 39th game idea (an extra Premier League game to be played overseas) which was first mooted and widely condemned in 2008 and then subsequently shelved by the Premier League has, inevitably, re-emerged under a new guise, whereby it is apparently proposed that one of the 38 games each Premier League team plays would be played overseas. 'Playing a fixture overseas would inevitably impact on the integrity of the Premier League. Playing football in a different climate and time zone could potentially impact on a team's performance. ""Home"" advantage would also disappear, giving those clubs playing a nominal ""away"" game an advantage across the season, as such games would essentially be played on neutral grounds.' 'The integrity of English football is at risk. As ever it seems as if those at the top are focused purely on short-term cash over the long-term interests of the game. 'With clubs continually pressing the loyal, match-going support for more and more money - despite the huge amounts now coming into the game from commercial and television contracts - it is important that those running our clubs, and the FA, see sense in this matter. 'The English football leagues are loved across the globe. As the country which brought the beautiful game to the world, we have a long standing history of passionate, honest competition that has received millions of admirers at home and abroad, over many years. 'This integrity will be shattered if the Premier League is allowed to ratify competitive matches overseas, which are designed purely as a money making exercise. 'In the interests of fair competition we also question how the idea of a 38th match overseas will work. Playing one round of competitive matches at neutral venues will mean one less home match for at least 10 Premier League teams, and with that there is the loss of advantage in home support. Does that really work in the interests of fair play?' 'It should never be forgotten that match-going fans are the life and soul of our game,' the BSM statement continued. 'We appreciate that monster commercial and television contracts have ensured the Premier League and its clubs are rolling in cash and that there is less reliance on income from ticket sales, but without the attendance and passion of the fans at matches, the Premier League would have no brand to sell. 'While it's fantastic that the Premier League has acquired millions of new fans across the globe, the idea of playing a round of matches abroad and the associated issues that come with it, could be disastrous. 'Let alone the immorality of tweaking the competition's rules purely as a means to bring in even more cash, with the complexity and problems that overseas matches could bring, certain clubs also stand to lose millions of pounds bearing in mind one decision or a single goal under enforced different circumstances could mean missing out on European qualification, or relegation.'","Arsenal fans and Chelsea supporters come out against potential plans .

"CLICK HERE to read Joe Bernstein's full match report from the Etihad . Manchester City took advantage of Chelsea's slip against Newcastle to reduce the lead at the top of the Premier League table following their 1-0 defeat of Everton at the Etihad Stadium. Sergio Aguero lasted only a few minutes before being forced off with a thigh injury but Yaya Toure scored the match-winner from the penalty spot after Phil Jagielka had fouled James Milner. Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler was at the Etihad to see how players from both sides fared... VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats . Yaya Toure (2nd left) scores a penalty to earn Manchester City a 1-0 victory over Everton . Manuel Pellegrini (right) saw his side close the gap on league leaders Chelsea to three points . With Sergio Aguero injured, Samir Nasri was City's most influential player during the hard-fought victory . MANCHESTER CITY 4-4-1-1 . Joe Hart 6.5 . Had few chances to prove he’s worth that new £120,000-a-contract but produced the goods when it mattered to deny Lukaku . Pablo Zabaleta 6 . Another solid performance from City’s Mr Reliable. No need for the ‘baby’ goal celebrations this time though. Eliaquim Mangala 6.5 . Gave one of his more assured performances on his return from suspension and won the heavyweight battle with Lukaku. England keeper Joe Hart pulled off a series of saves to ensure the points were not shared . Martin Demichelis 6.5 . Didn’t put a foot wrong and produced a fantastic challenge to deny Eto’o right at the death. Gael Clichy 6 . Did a good job keeping Seamus Coleman quiet down the Everton right and got forward well when required. Jesus Navas 6.5 . A real handful for Leighton Baines with his electric pace, although end product sometimes lacking. Yaya Toure 6.5 .

Had no chance with the penalty but produced a fine reflex save from substitute Pozo in the second half to keep Everton in it. Tony Hibbert 6 . Had his hands full with Milner down the City left and when Nasri drifted wide to give him even more problems. Phil Jagielka 6 . Can count himself unfortunate to have been penalised for the challenge on Milner. A lot of referees wouldn’t have given that. Phil Jagielka (2nd right) argues with the referee after bringing down James Milner to concede a penalty . Sylvain Distin 6.5 . Former City defender is still doing the business at the age of 36. Snuffed out the danger on more than one occasion. Leighton Baines 5.5 . Difficult to make his usual forays forward with Navas keeping him on the back foot so much of the time. Muhamed Besic 5.5 . No malice intended for Aguero injury. Replaced early in the second half as Everton looked to attack more. Gareth Barry 5 . Lucky the officials didn’t spot his forearm into Milner’s face when he was already on a booking for fouling his old teammate. Off-form Kevin Mirallas runs with the ball as the Everton forward is chased by three City players . Samuel Eto'o (2nd right) was one of the few Everton players to do himself justice . Seamus Coleman 5.5 . A quiet game by his standards. Never really got going and posed little threat to the City defence. Samuel Eto’o 7 . Received treatment after an early knee in the back from Mangala but still proved to be a real handful. Kevin Mirallas 5 . Disappointing from a player who can do a lot better. Should have been more effective with set-pieces as well. Romelu Lukaku 6 . The big Belgian was kept very quiet by Mangala and Demichelis, but went close with a volley late in the game.

"Grant Leadbitter grabbed a double as Middlesbrough comprehensively won the battle of two Championship promotion hopefuls by brushing aside Norwich 4-0. Aitor Karanka's side showed just why they are being so heavily tipped for a return to the Premier League with a superb display that saw them rise to second in the table. In complete control from the moment Patrick Bamford opened the scoring in the fifth minute, Middlesbrough took the points as Leadbitter struck his eighth and ninth goals of the campaign prior to Yanic Wildschut completing the scoring.

Leadbitter steps up and converts a penalty to make it 2-0 to Middlesbrough after 33 minutes . John Ruddy (right) was left no chance in the Norwich goal as Leadbitter (left) scored . Anticipation was high at the Riverside for a meeting of sides occupying play-off places. The hosts began in the ascendancy, Bamford's header securing the perfect start. And Boro would not relinquish control thereafter, with Leadbitter and Wildschut ensuring Saturday's clash with Bournemouth would be a meeting of the top two. Karanka's men started like a team brimming with confidence and could have taken the lead when Ryan Fredericks hit an early volley just over. But they did not have to wait much longer for an opener, Lee Tomlin playing a lovely through-ball to Albert Adomah - whose cross left Bamford with the simple task of diverting a diving header beyond John Ruddy. Norwich came back into the game impressively, with the likes of Nathan Redmond and Kyle Lafferty looking threatening. Patrick Bamford opened the scoring for Middlesbrough (centre) with a header inside the box . Bamford (right) celebrates putting Middlesbrough ahead with his fourth goal of the season . The pair almost teed up a leveller when good interplay ended with Redmond finding Gary O'Neill, only for the former Middlesbrough man to see his low effort turned around the post by Dimi Konstantopoulos. That set the tone for much of the opening period, with Lafferty volleying a golden chance over soon after. And Norwich's failure to take advantage of those opportunities came back to haunt them as Leadbitter sent Ruddy the wrong way after Russell Martin had felled George Friend in the box. Norwich, who brought on Gary Hooper at the interval in an attempt to spark a turnaround, continued their dominance of possession early in the second period. Yet their profligacy showed up again initially, with in-form striker Cameron Jerome hitting wildly over the crossbar after being picked out by Hooper. Nathan Redmond (right) plays a ball around Middlesbrough's Adam Clayton . Norwich's players (from left) Jonny Howson, Lewis Grabban and Michael Turner look dejected . Boro would again find a foothold and Leadbitter saw a deflected effort fly narrowly wide. Fredericks was next to threaten when forcing Ruddy into a fine reactionary save after unleashing a vicious low strike from 30 yards. Middlesbrough finally grabbed the third their dominance deserved, though, when Tomlin's wonderful chipped pass allowed Leadbitter to loop a header over Ruddy. Norwich's heads dropped thereafter, with the home side continuing to look the more threatening. And a dreadful night for Neil Adams' men was capped when Ruddy mishandled Leadbitter's corner to leave Wildschut to slide a fourth into the empty net.","Patrick Bamford headed Middlesbrough in front after just five minutes .

"Newcastle United have unveiled an eye-catching Puma third kit - the day before thousands of banners will be displayed at St James' Park calling for manager Alan Pardew to be sacked. With pressure mounting on the beleaguered Pardew by the day and the Magpies preparing for what is already a must-win game against Hull City on Saturday, the timing of the kit release could not be any worse. SackPardew.com have printed 200 banners and more than 15,000 posters ready to be displayed calling for the Newcastle manager to be removed from his position by owner Mike Ashley. Newcastle United have released a new third kit design just a day before their key clash with Hull City .

Text used on the posters is also a parody of the Sports Direct logo - the company which Ashley owns and which is emblazoned across large sections of St James' Park's advertising space. The half-blue, half-green Puma design of the new Puma kit harks back to Newcastle's opening campaigns in the Premier League. The third kit worn between 1993 and 1995 was largely green but had navy blue pin stripes. But the new kit is split evenly between the two colours and features a paler green than the previous design. It will be worn for the first time when Newcastle visit Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium on Monday, September 29. But Newcastle and Pardew face what promises to be a poisonous atmosphere at St James' on Saturday first. The Tynesiders are winless and sit bottom of the table having taken just two points from four matches, making the Hull match a must-win match for Pardew.

The Magpies' third kit will go on sale at 9am on Saturday - with shirts priced at £44.99 for adults and £31.99 for juniors - and managing director Lee Charnley said: 'We wanted to involve our supporters in the design and approval process for this kit and as such we presented a number of options to Fans Forum members. 'We are delighted to unveil this kit, chosen by those members, which I am sure our players and fans will wear with pride.'

"A plucky little girl visiting Disney World in Orlando, Florida made it known to Gaston of Beauty and the Beast that there was absolutely no way he was going to be marrying Belle. The girl, coincidentally named Isabella, was not impressed by Gaston's notorious charms and footage of her defiantly standing up for Belle awarded her over 200,000 views on YouTube after being posted on November 9. 'Belle is going to marry me today,' Gaston says to Isabella as he signs his autograph in one of her books. Standing her ground: Isabella isn't shy when it comes to telling Gaston he is not marrying Belle . making her point: Isabella tells Gaston over and over again that The Beast is marrying Belle . 'No, No, No.,' she responds. ‘The Beast is marrying Belle!' Onlookers can't help but laugh at this little girl's conviction for her favorite Disney character. Gaston's outlandish responses are also worth a chuckle . 'I don't know where this girl came from but somebody needs to put her back in the kitchen where she belongs right now,' he states proudly in attempt to mark his territory. When the little girl goes to pose for a portrait with Gaston he tries to break her spirit once more and says, 'smile like you're making me a sandwich.' 'Now girl go do what you're supposed to do in life. And no more thinking for you.' Isabella is unimpressed with his stereotypical insults and she pours salt on his wound once more. 'YOU'RE not marrying Belle,' she reminds him as she looks at him right in the eyes without flinching. 'You are never, ever, ever, ever!' 'Forever ever?,' he asks holding back tears. Isabella then reminds him that the Beast is actually a prince, a very strong one at that. 'The Beast will fight with you,'she exclaims. 'I've been outdone by a girl. A short one,' he concludes admitting his defeat. Setting him straight: Isabella tells Gaston he'd better be on his best behavior otherwise The Beast will fight . Conviction: In case he didn't hear her the first time, Isabella reminds Gaston he isn't going near Belle . Admitting defeat: Gaston finally admits to being a beat by a girl, although he points out she is rather short .","'Belle is going to marry me today,' Gaston says to plucky Isabella as he signs his autograph in one of her books .

"Felix Magath insisted he was ‘completely confident’ in his job despite watching Britt Assombalonga net a hat-trick to condemn his team to a sixth defeat of the season in crushing style. The Fulham manager claimed poor refereeing and bad fortune were to blame for the 5-3 scoreline that sent Nottingham Forest back to the top of the Championship table. Magath admitted Fulham’s total of one point from seven games and a goal difference of minus 12 was ‘a catastrophe’ as travelling supporters called for his head. Britt Assombalonga claps the home fans clutching the match ball after his hat-trick for Nottingham Forest . Britt Assombalonga has already scored eight goals in seven matches in the league this season . Felix Magath has come under increasing pressure and a 5-3 loss to Nottingham Forest leaves him clinging on . Nottingham Forest 4-2-3-1: Darlow 6; Hunt 6.5, Mancienne 6, Fox 5.5, Lichaj 5.5 (Wilson 56’ 5); Tesche 6.5 (Lascelles 90’), Osborn 6 (Paterson 69’ 7); Burke 7, Lansbury 7.5, Antonio 8; Assombalonga 9 .

Attendance: 22,572 . Man of the Match: Britt Assombalonga . But he added: ‘When you have the referee against you it’s difficult to stand up. I don’t know what’s going on here. ‘I can understand the fans’ frustrations. I’m very sad that we are bottom. It’s terrible I know, for the players and for me. I don’t think about my job because I work with my team.’ Magath had a point about referee Darren Deadman, who awarded Forest a penalty that never was in the first-half and failed to send off Danny Fox for bringing down Hugo Rodallega as the last man in the second period. But when his team concedes five goals and lets a 3-2 lead slip in the final minutes any angst against officialdom is undermined. It had looked like Ross McCormack’s brace and Rodallega’s strike would be enough to earn Fulham their first win of the campaign having trailed 2-0. But Michail Antonio equalised and then Assombalonga followed up his header against the post with a poacher’s finish. Substitute Jamie Paterson added a fifth in the final minute after racing clear. Magath made five changes to the team who lost 3-0 at Reading, to take his total number of players used this season to 26. It took only 20 minutes for Fulham’s modest travelling contingent to chant ‘Felix out’. Assombalonga slots home his second goal of the night from the penalty spot at the City Ground . Hugo Rodallega (left) takes the ball round the keeper, only for his shot to be cleared off the line . Nikolay Bodurov of Fulham looks dejected as Fulham remain bottom of the league . In that time their team had shown enough defensive disorganisation to slump two goals down. Deadman pointed to the spot when Shaun Hutchinson slid to take the ball away from Antonio. The challenge was robust but perfectly fair and Fulham’s players protested their case. Dan Burn laid hands on the referee and got cautioned. Assombalonga buried the spot-kick and then ran to the touchline to hold aloft Chris Cohen’s shirt in tribute to the club captain, who has suffered the third cruciate ligament injury of his career. Assombalonga had opened the scoring in the ninth minute, charging onto a free-kick by Henri Lansbury. If a sign of the value Forest have found in Assombalonga was required, you needed to look no further than the other end of the pitch. McCormack cost double the £5.5million Pearce paid to Peterborough but had scored only once in seven appearances before kick-off. Gabor Kiraly (right) cannot reach Assombalonga's penalty, which put the home side 2-0 up . Tracksuit-wearing Kiraly places the ball for a goal-kick for Fulham on Wednesday night . He doubled his Fulham total just after the half hour mark with a superb free-kick from 25-yards. Rodallega found the equaliser in the 51th minute, volleying in a cross from the left amid awful defending. McCormack got what looked to be the winner in the 65th minute, finishing past Darlow with the aid of a deflection after Rodallega’s through ball. But Forest responded. Antonio calmly slotted home from Michael Mancienne’s pass and then 11 minutes from time Assombalonga converted Chris Burke’s cross at the second time of asking for his eighth goal of the season. Steve Wigley, Forest assistant manager, said: ‘I thought we were fortunate.

"By the time the most calamitous, catastrophic and cursed Ryder Cup debut ever to feature in Stephen Gallacher’s worst nightmares had come to a shuddering anti-climax, victorious American rookies Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed were six under par. That’s not a bad better-ball score for 14 holes. Certainly far too good for a European pairing who played just about well enough to be six under fives for their truncated round. Give Gallacher another hundred burls around Gleneagles and he’ll probably never turn in such a tight and tension-ridden show of unimpressive scoring. Give him a partner like Ian Poulter – the Ian Poulter of yesterday, not Ryder Cups past – and even his best performance might not be enough. Stephen Gallacher made a shocking Ryder Cup debut on Friday as he froze under the pressure of the occasion . Partner Ian Poulter was unable to salvage anything for Europe on Friday morning, and performed poorly . Against a couple of US first-timers who should have been standing on that first tee with everything from toenails to split ends clenched under the strain of the situation, the local hero and *the* hero of so many European triumphs were found more than wanting. Their round started with Gallacher finding the bunker, the hazard and then the run-off area behind the green before picking up – and ended with the unforgivable sight, very nearly an unpardonable sin, of Poulter leaving short a birdie putt that would have at least extended the match to the 15th tee. Beaten? Gallacher and Poulter were pulverised by the accuracy of Spieth and the clutch putting of Reed, the self-styled world top five player who backed up his big mouth with some really impressive play in a 5&4 away win. Gallacher denied that he felt the pressure of the occasion but admitted it took him a while to hit his stride . Poulter comes out of a bunker on the third on Friday but could ultimately do little to help Europe . And yet, on a day that had begun in an atmosphere described by Gallacher as ‘euphoric’, the Americans didn’t need to play like the next Phil Mickelson-Keegan Bradley partnership in order to get the points. They were never under pressure. Poulter could offer only consolation and hope to his crestfallen partner afterwards, reminding him that his own unhappy debut – a 4&3 fourballs beating, in the company of Darren Clarke, by Tiger Woods and Chris Riley – didn’t do him any long-term harm. ‘I said to Stevie walking off the golf course today that, when I played with Darren Clarke in 2004, we had our butts kicked the first time I ever played - and obviously we’ve had that today,’ said the Englishman, who suffered only his fourth loss in 16 Ryder Cup matches. ‘But you know what, things can change very quickly and we have to keep our heads up right now. It didn’t quite work for us on the golf course but we have to look forward to the matches we’re going to play ahead. ‘This is a tricky golf course and tricky conditions. I don’t think the scores are as low as what some people are expecting out there. So we have to stay focused, be strong as a team and go out there and deliver.’ Both men will need to improve drastically if they’re to contribute. From the off, with Gallacher looking even more pale than usual, they simply struggled to get to grips with their games, their opponents and the occasion. USA captain Tom Watson congratulates Patrick Reed after he and Jordan Spieth beat Poulter and Gallacher . From the moment Poulter lipped out a short putt on the first, they were in trouble. Gallacher birdied the par-five second, enough for a half, but he didn’t contribute again until they were three down – and his missed birdie chance on the eighth, following his first really excellent iron shot of the day, felt like a turning point. Watched by his mum, dad and son Jack, Gallacher was really struggling. He got little help from Poulter, who followed a perfect drive on the par-five ninth by clunking his approach shot into the middle of the water; it wasn’t even close. With both Spieth and Reed having looks at birdie, it was no surprise when the Yanks went four up. They were five ahead after 10, Spieth draining one from 12 feet, and six clear when Reed made birdie on the 11th. At least Gallacher pulled a hole back on 12, a par enough to win the hole, but he missed a good chance to eat further into the deficit on the next, sliding a 10-footer past. Poulter (left) and Gallacher come to terms with the comprehensive defeat handed out to them on Friday . The end came on the 14th green, watched by Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson, who were hanging around after having their own pairing dismantled on that very green a little earlier in the day. Both Team Europe players had putts to win the hole. Both missed. Not quite the full story of the day. But not far off. Gallacher, who had looked horribly tense for much of the day, admitted: ‘I think there are nerves any time you play. It’s just you learn to channel it and that’s why you’ve got pre-shot routines and things like that. ‘Maybe a wee bit to start with. I didn’t feel under any pressure at all, really. I was really looking forward to it, and it just didn’t really pan out. That was all. Didn’t quite play that well. And then when I did start to play well, I never capitalised on it by holing the putts. USA Ryder Cup players Patrick Reed (R) and Jordan Speith celebrate their comfortable win . ‘I think your first Ryder Cup, obviously there’s a bit of excitement and a bit of sort of, you don’t really know what to expect. It took me maybe five or six holes to get into it. I was a bit out of rhythm but I would rather have the fans on you and cheering for you than not, if that’s what you mean. ‘It was a special reception on the first tee, something that I definitely will remember for the rest of my life. It was just euphoric, really. It was what I expected, basically, and a bit more.’ Poulter added: ‘To walk to the first tee with Stevie, at home for him, that was a special moment. He’s going to remember that for a long time and I’ll remember it, as well. It was an amazing atmosphere. But obviously we couldn’t do our bit to get them really loud.’ The star of the Miracle at Medinah also talked about the Americans having ‘ham and egged’ well, a reference to their ability to dovetail. Well, they certainly made mincemeat of our boys.","Stephen Gallacher and Ian Poulter  lost against USA's Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed 5&4 on Friday morning .

"Norwich produced an astonishing second-half fightback to stun Cardiff and claim a 4-2 victory at Cardiff City Stadium. The Canaries, unbeaten since their opening day defeat at Wolves, were awful during the first half and deservedly trailed to goals from Joe Ralls and Aron Gunnarsson. But quickfire strikes from Martin Olsson and Wes Hoolahan levelled matters early in the second half, before Michael Turner and substitute Cameron Jerome finished the job. Norwich's second-half fightback saw the Canaries claw back from a two-goal deficit to win 4-2 . Four goals in Norwich's second-half fightback saw the Canaries win 4-2 against Cardiff City . Cardiff: Marshall, Brayford, Connolly, Morrison, Fabio (John 46), Ralls, Gunnarsson, Whittingham, Pilkington (Adeyemi 69), Jones (Maynard 69), Macheda . Subs (not used): Cala, Le Fondre, Moller Daehli, Moore . Bookings: Ralls . Goals: Ralls (4), Gunnarsson (22) Norwich: Ruddy, Martin, Turner, Hooiveld, Olsson, Tettey, Johnson, Lafferty (Jerome 46), Hoolahan (O'Neil 84), Redmond (Garrido 88), Grabban . Subs (not used): Odjidja-Ofoe, Whittaker, Murphy, Rudd, . Bookings: Lafferty, Turner . Goals: Olsson (54), Hoolahan (58), Turner (71), Jerome (87) Such an outcome had looked highly unlikely as Cardiff, challenged to prove their Championship title credentials by manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, raced out of the traps. Inside a minute Kenwyne Jones had seen his goalwards glancing header hacked clear, but there was no reprieve for Norwich in the fourth minute. Ralls seized on Turner's loose pass and drove beyond Alex Tettey to send a left-footed drive into the bottom corner. It was the young midfielder's second league goal for the Bluebirds, almost three years after his first. The visitors were all at sea although Kyle Lafferty almost levelled with a curling strike which David Marshall did well to punch away to safety. Norwich fell further behind in the 22nd minute. Jones played in Anthony Pilkington down the right, and his cross was expertly tucked home by Gunnarsson. Having dominated the opening half an hour Cardiff sowed the seeds of their own downfall by surrendering the initiative during the final 15 minutes of the half and, aside from one excellent John Ruddy stop to deny Federico Macheda's volley, they were not to regain it. Cardiff's Aron Gunnarsson doubles Cardiff's lead in the first half as Norwich struggled to get a foothold . Cardiff's Aron Gunnarsson runs away in celebration after doubling Cardiff's lead over a frustrated Norwich side . Cardiff's Aron Gunnarsson is joined by Anthony Pilkington as the pair celebrate going 2-0 up . Cardiff let their 2-0 lead from the first half slip as a disastrous second 45 minutes saw Norwich net four times . The loss of Fabio to injury weakened the left-side of the Cardiff defence, with Declan John on in his place, and Norwich took full advantage. Firstly Hoolahan was given far too much room to get a ball into Lewis Grabban in the 54th minute. The in-form striker could not turn Sean Morrison but the ball fell kindly for Olsson to slot home from close range, on the Swede's return to the side after his ban for pushing referee Simon Hooper. Four minutes later Norwich were level. Nathan Redmond evaded Ralls and John to deliver a pinpoint cross for Jerome to power a header straight at Marshall, who could do nothing as Hoolahan gleefully dispatched the follow-up. Cardiff were rocked and they fell behind with 19 minutes to play. Tettey found space down the Norwich right and Russell Martin's mis-hit shot was turned in by Turner as Marshall appealed in vain for offside. The Bluebirds responded with Whittingham twice working Ruddy, and Turner being fortunate to only receive a booking after bringing down Nicky Maynard with the substitute through on goal. But former Cardiff striker Cameron Jerome put the result beyond doubt three minutes from time. Splintering the hosts' offside trap to round Marshall before tucking home.

"She is known for her curve-hugging ‘wiggle’ dresses. But when Nigella Lawson wore not one, but two stunning designs from a small British dressmaker last week, she caused the firm’s website to go ‘into meltdown’. The TV chef first stepped out in New York on Tuesday in a show-stopping £135 red ‘Catherine’ dress from London-based Diva Catwalk to promote the new series of her US cookery show The Taste. A spokeswoman for the fashion label told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We are only a small firm but Nigella has been a fan for years. We don’t know how she first heard of us but she’s been wearing our designs for a couple of years now. Scroll down for video . Classy: The TV chef first stepped out in New York on Tuesday in a show-stopping £135 red ‘Catherine’ dress from London-based Diva Catwalk to promote the new series of her US cookery show The Taste . ‘Last year she wore our Midhurst dress on The Taste and the response was so overwhelming that our website crashed. She only has to wear a dress once for there to be a deluge in orders. We call it the Nigella factor. ‘This week we were inundated with calls and internet orders when she wore the Catherine dress, which sold out immediately. Our phone lines and internet have gone into meltdown. ‘It’s amazing how Nigella promotes British design. We could not be more thrilled. We are only a small company but when Nigella wears our dresses the world notices and we sell out. ‘We are incredibly grateful to her for her support.’ Daring: The 54-year-old presenter later tweeted that she was unaware how revealing her dress was as she sat behind her judge’s desk . On Thursday night, The Taste aired on America’s ABC network and Nigella again wore a Diva Catwalk creation, this time a low-cut pale blue £115 ‘Opal’ dress. The 54-year-old – known as the Domestic Goddess – later tweeted that she was unaware how revealing it was as she sat behind her judge’s desk, writing: ‘I had no idea quite so much décolletage was on display; mortified.’ Other celebrities including Carol Vorderman and Olympian Denise Lewis are fans of Diva Catwalk’s figure-hugging designs, but the firm’s spokeswoman said: ‘Only Nigella gets the phone ringing off the hook. 'It’s because she always looks so amazing and our dresses flatter her in all the right places.’ Comeback: It was a triumphant return to the US last week for Nigella, who was previously barred from the United States over allegations made during a court case in Britain last year that she took cocaine .

She later sorted out her visa and was allowed back into the country to record a third series of the show, in which she appears alongside celebrity chefs Anthony Bourdain, Marcus Samuelsson and Ludo Lefebvre. But while Nigella’s appearance won over American viewers, one of her team’s culinary creations – deep-fried macaroni cheese balls – failed to win approval and the contestant was the first to be voted off the show.","TV chef stepped out in New York on Tuesday in a show-stopping dress .

"CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report on heartbreak for City at the Allianz Arena . There are certain, unavoidable signs of a centre forward lost in a haze of low confidence and Robert Lewandowski exhibited them in spades on Wednesday night. Heavy first touches, weak finishing, failure to get the head up and utilise peripheral vision. You could easily have put the Bayern striker’s name all the way down the checklist. It can be painful to watch, whoever you support. Down the other end of the field, Manchester City’s Edin Dzeko must have looked on and winced. He knows what it feels like to see the goal shrink to the size of a waste paper bin but the Bosnian also knows what it’s like to come out of the other side of a confidence crisis. Dzeko survived his own issues at Manchester City and surely Lewandowski will survive his own here in Bavaria. Robert Lewandowski looked low on confidence as Bayern laboured to a goalless draw with Manchester City . Lewandowski was outshone by his Manchester City counterpart Edin Dzeko (R) at the Allianz Arena . With Dzeko – who arrived at City on the back on bundles of goals for Wolfsburg in January 2011 – it was the demands of life in a new league and environment that foxed him. That and a very modest relationship with his manager at that time, Roberto Mancini. With Bayern’s Polish striker Lewandowski, it would appear to be the challenges of playing for a really big club that is vexing him after his move from Borussia Dortmund. He has actually scored five goals this season already, the only problem is that four came in one game for Poland last week. Lewandowski skewed his opening shot just wide after being smothered out by Joe Hart in the first half . The Poland international was unable to find any joy from his tussles with Vincent Kompany . Prior to this game, every one of the talkers at a Bayern press conference – coach Pep Guardiola and players Philipp Lahm and Jerome Boateng – was asked about Lewandowski’s poor form by journalists. The replies were all positive, of course, but only goals really matter when it comes to hushing chatter about centre forwards in press rooms and bars and cafes. Lewandowski has one for Bayern in the Bundesliga so far but it came away at Schalke. He hasn’t scored at the Allianz Arena yet and, until he does, the chatter will go on. On Wednesday he certainly had his chances an opening half that Bayern dominated. Had he been wearing the yellow of Dortmund rather than the famous red of Bayern then he perhaps would have scored twice early in the game. The first opening looked made for him as he moved in to space on to a pass on the edge the penalty area but as Bayern supporters shuffled towards the edge of their seats in anticipation a first touch so heavy as to be almost violent took the ball away from him. Lewandowski battles with Manchester City defender Martin Demichelis for the ball but couldn't get his goal . City defenders rush into challenges as Lewandowski makes his way into the danger area . Soon after he did manage to guide the ball around Joe Hart but, from a tight angle, the ball was subsequently directed rather meekly in to the side netting. That is what low confidence does. It turns things that normally come naturally in to challenges that, all of a sudden, can’t be met. Certainly this was a different Bayern team last night than the one that we are used to. Take Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben out of this side and the whole pattern – the whole rhythm – of the play changes. With Bayern’s two scampering wide men flying down either side and – when the mood takes them – cutting inside, it must be a dream to be a number nine. However, the play was a little narrower and one can only imagine that when Ribery and Robben do return from injury Lewandowski’s life will become rather easier. Here against City Bayern’s chances came in a flurry early on and Hart had to be somewhere near his best to keep his team in the game. Dzeko was chosen to start ahead of Sergio Aguero and led City's line with a commanding performance . Dzeko has overcome his early teethinbg problems at the Etihad after winning Manuel Pellegrini's trust . As City gradually improved, so Dzeko was able to exert himself on the contest, though. Such is his standing at City now that it was not such a surprise to see the 28-year-old handed a starting berth ahead of Sergio Aguero. With Alvaro Negredo allowed to go back to Spain at his own request last month, City coach Manuel Pellegrini will rotate his three remaining strikers all season long. Dzeko, at last, looks capable of more than holding his own. On Wednesday his running was intelligent and his hold-up play astute. One run on to a David Silva pass – that led to a shot to the near post – looked almost intuitive. When players don’t think too much, good things just happen.","Manchester City lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich in Champions League opener .

"More than 6,000 new recruits have joined ISIS since America started targeting the terrorist group with air strikes last month, it has been claimed. Of those radical Muslims flocking to ISIS' ranks, at least 1,300 are foreigners who have arrived from outside the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq currently under the group's control, according to analysts from the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. News of the surge in numbers comes as France said it would no longer refer to the group as ISIS or the Islamic State, and would instead be calling them by the derogatory title 'Daesh cutthroats'. ISIS, which has been condemned as barbaric even by notorious terror group Al Qaeda, rebranded as Islamic State earlier this year after declaring the formation of a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. Scroll down for video . Growing threat: More than 6,000 new recruits have joined ISIS (pictured) since America started targeting the terrorist group with air strikes last month - at least 1,300 of them foreigners travelling to the Middle East . ISIS' numbers have swelled in the weeks since America launched the first of 167 air strikes against the militant group on August 8. A number of rebel commanders who oppose ISIS but also fight against their enemy Syrian president Bashar Assad have warned that the strikes are increasing local support for the terrorists. As well as aggressive social media-led recruitment campaigns in the Middle East, ISIS has released a number of slick English-language propaganda videos and digital magazines designed to encourage young Muslims living in Western nations to join the terror group. ISIS aims to convince impressionable young Westerners that its brutal interpretation of Islam is how God intended believers to live and that all those who oppose the group can justifiably be murdered. The vast majority of the 1,300 foreign fighters who have signed up to join ISIS in the past month are aged between 15 and 20-years-old and have never been involved in a conflict before, according to Abdurrahman Saleh - a spokesman for the Islam Army, part of the Islamic Front rebel group. ISIS receives approximately 20 new recruits a day in the town of north-west Syrian town al-Bab alone, he told The Times. Many of these jihadists are thought to have easily entered Syria across the porous border with Turkey, having arrived in the latter country on budget airline flights to popular tourist airport Antayla. Change: French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the country will no longer refer to ISIS as the Islamic State and would now be using the derogatory title 'Daesh cutthroats'instead . Anger: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (right) has denounced ISIS' beheading of innocent people, saying the  shameful actions of the militant group (led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, left) violate Islamic principles . Rebels fighting against president Bashar al-Assad in northwestern Syria are suspected of sabotaging a batch of measles vaccination -leading to the deaths of 50 young children. Dozens of infants in the rebel-held cities of Jarjanaz and Sinjar in Idlib province died on Tuesday, minutes after being given the drug. Although the cause of death has not yet been established, officials reportedly suspect the vaccines may have been tampered with while unguarded in a storage facility in the city of Jarjanaz. The vaccinations are part of a large-scale campaign to stop the spread of measles, mumps, rubella, and polio in rebel-held areas of northern Syria. They are being distributed by volunteer medical and aid organisations operating in the area, according to the Boston Globe. In a Skype interview with the newspaper, Dr Abdulla Ajaj - a physician who helped administer the vaccine - said the drugs had been delivered to the medical centre three days before being given to the children. 'This is the first time we have had such a problem,' he added. Mr Ajaj proposed an alternative theory for the deaths - the vaccines were stored at too high a temperature. Most probably they were badly kept inside the fridges,' he said. Samples of the leftover drug have now been sent to Turkey for analysis . It is not yet known how long it will be before the results of the investigation are released. How to refer to ISIS has been a source of much debate in the West - not least because the militant group has continually renamed itself. Formed as Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad (meaning Group of Monotheism and Jihad) in 1999, the militants changed name to Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn (meaning Jihad Base in the Land of Two Rivers) in 2003. As it became better known, Western countries began referring to the group as Al Qaeda in Iraq, also known as AQI. In 2006 the group became part of  an umbrella organization called the Mujahideen Shura Council before re-branding as Dawlat al-ʻIraq al-Islāmīyah (the Islamic State of Iraq, or ISI) later the same year. Last year, having expanded into Syria, the group changed its name to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). An alternative name for the Levant of Greater Syria is 'Sham' which led to the alternative name Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). The derogatory Arabian acronym Daesh - the name France now says it will now refer to ISIS by - is based on the Arabic version of this name: al-Dawla al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham. Earlier this year the group claimed to have established a caliphate in the Middle East, and dropped all geographic references in its name - simply calling itself the Islamic State. Referring to the group by this name has proven problematic as the group is neither a recognised independent state, nor does it represent the views of the majority of Muslims. A total of 20 new recruits a day equates to 500 jihadists turning up in Al-Bab every month - with Mr Saleh saying there are 'hundreds' of other towns in Syria seeing a similar level of arrival. The group pay wages of up to £600 a month to seasoned fighters from areas like North Africa and Chechnya, and even greater sums to professional workers such as doctors and surgeons, according to Hussam al-Marie, a spokesman for the Free Syrian Army. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula yesterday launched an unprecedented plea for its affiliate in Syria, Jabhat Al Nusra, to stop fighting against ISIS and unite against a U.S. led 'alliance of infidelity and evil.' The development came as France said it would no longer refer to ISIS as the Islamic State and would now be using the derogatory title 'Daesh cutthroats'. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius asked journalists and media organisations to comply with the request, arguing 'this is a terrorist group and not a state', and saying any other title unfairly blurs the line between ordinary Muslims and extremists. Terror: As well as aggressive social media-led recruitment campaigns in the Middle East, ISIS has released a number of slick English-language propaganda videos (such as the one pictured above) and digital magazines designed to encourage young Muslims living in Western nations to join the terror group . Spread: Nine imams were among 15 people arrested by masked police (pictured) in Kosovo yesterday. The arrests were allegedly to stop the flow of young Muslims leaving the country to join ISIS . The name Daesh is taken from the loose acronym Arabian nations use to abbreviate their name for the Islamic State: al-Dawla al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham. ISIS has condemned the  acronym Daesh as insulting and disrespectful because it sounds like the Arabic words 'daes' - which means 'one who crushes something underfoot', and 'dahes' - which means 'one who sows discord'. The word 'dahes' also has negative connotations to turbulent pre-Islamic era of infighting between Arab tribes - a period of history that has come to be known as Dahes wal Ghabra. This morning Iranian President Hassan Rouhani denounced ISIS' beheading of innocent people, saying the militant group's shameful actions violate Islamic principles. 'From the viewpoint of the Islamic tenets and culture, killing ... innocent people equals the killing of the whole humanity,' Rouhani told U.S. television network NBC. 'And therefore, the killing and beheading of innocent people in fact is a matter of shame for them and it's the matter of concern and sorrow for all the human and all the mankind,' he added. The 22-year-old Sydney man arrested in Australia's largest counterterrorism operation allegedly conspired with Australia's most senior Islamist militant to launch a deadly attack on a random passerby, court documents show. According to the documents, police intercepted a phone call between the arrested Omarjan Azari and Mohammad Ali Baryalei - who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East - two days ago. The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack which Sydney Central Local Court heard was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'. Omarjan Azari appeared in Sydney's Central Local Court charged with conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil . Before it emerged this month that Baryalei had become a senior Islamic State militant, he worked as a bouncer in Sydney's Kings Cross nightclub district and had also played a bit part in the TV series Underbelly. Azari today appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil. He is the only man charged so far after police arrested 15 people in raids earlier today. Police Prosecutor Michael Allnutt told the court that Azari had made a threat during a phone call a few days ago which involved a 'random selection of persons to execute'. Police intercepted a phone call between the arrested Omarjan Azari and Mohammad Ali Baryalei (pictured) who worked as a bouncer at a Kings Cross nightclub and played a bit part in an episode of Underbelly . Azari, who has dark hair, a beard and moustache, had displayed 'an unusual level of fanaticism' in the call, which was intercepted by police. Azari's lawyer Steve Boland did not apply for bail but asked Magistrate Richard Bailey if Azari could go back down to the dock during the hearing. Magistrate Bailey agreed and Azari, who had sat in the dock stroking his beard and smiled briefly while talking to Mr Boland, left the courtroom.","Thousands of radical Muslims have joined ISIS since first airstrike in August .

"Whistlestop tour: The private dinner is one of ten engagements the Duke and Duchess have during their two-day US trip . It is the most hotly anticipated Royal visit since the days of Princess Diana. Huge crowds, heart-warming photo opportunities and a meeting with the President are all on the schedule. But when, later today, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge start their whirlwind New York tour, they will have another, rather more confidential objective in mind. For tonight, at a lavish reception at a private residence from which the press is barred, Kate and William will shake the hands of 15 wealthy couples who are each paying $50,000 –– or £32,000 – for the privilege. It is the start of an important US campaign which they hope will pull in millions for their favourite charities. A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The dinner on the first night is essentially a fundraiser. The people William and Kate will be meeting are not celebrities but seriously wealthy hedge fund types and financiers.’ The event will be hosted by British advertising mogul Sir Martin Sorrell and his wife Cristiana at their vast apartment in mid-town Manhattan. Sir Martin, whose WPP Group is one of the world’s biggest marketing companies, earned £30 million last year. His stake in the business is worth £260 million. The guests have been asked to dress for cocktails, with drinks at 6.30pm followed by dinner at 7.30pm. They will be served by about eight royal staff. The money will go to the Royal Foundation, the charity run by the couple and Prince Harry which gives grants to good causes such as Tusk, the wildlife protection charity. ‘William and Kate are principally there to meet and greet and to raise money for the foundation,’ the source added. ‘The couples attending are being asked to pay thousands of dollars to be there, and there is a lot of talk about cash for access.’ Scroll down for video . The evening, which has been billed as ‘private’ on the official itinerary, has been organised by Caroline Oddy, executive director of the American Friends of the Royal Foundation, the US arm of the charity. The last time the couple both attended an event in aid of the Royal Foundation was in Santa Barbara in 2011. Tonight, at a lavish reception at a private residence from which the press is barred, Kate and William will shake the hands of 15 wealthy couples who are each paying £32,000 for the privilege . The guests at the Manhattan dinner have been asked to dress for cocktails, with drinks at 6.30pm followed by dinner at 7.30pm . Then, more than £650,000 was raised at a polo match, with individuals paying up to £65,000 to play alongside William. But since then, donations have declined. The Friends raised less than £260,000 in 2012. William is also keen to use the American tour to promote wildlife conservation. On Monday, he will travel alone to Washington where he will meet President Obama, before a conference on the illegal wildlife trade at the World Bank. However, last night it emerged that one of the board members of the American Friends of the Foundation, John Studzinksi, has a major financial interest in the controversial marine park SeaWorld. The event will be hosted by British advertising mogul Sir Martin Sorrell, above, and his wife Cristiana at their vast apartment in mid-town Manhattan . The 58-year-old, known as ‘Studz’, is senior managing director of The Blackstone Group, which owns SeaWorld parks in California, Texas and Florida. The parks have been mired in controversy after a scathing documentary, Blackfish, highlighted alleged cruelty towards killer whales and dolphins in captivity – although SeaWorld denied mistreating any animals. Last night a source said: ‘It is ironic that Prince William is going to be promoting his favourite animal charities while his main host is on the board of a company which owns amusement parks which exploit animals for entertainment.’ The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who are travelling without Prince George, will be meeting the Clintons during their two-day US tour . The Duke and Duchess, who are travelling without Prince George, will carry out ten engagements during the two-day tour, including a meeting with the Clintons, watching an NBA basketball match and a rumoured meeting with Jay Z and Beyoncé. It is the couple’s first visit to New York and they are staying at the exclusive Carlyle Hotel. The Duchess will carry out two solo engagements in New York on Monday, while William is in Washington, including visiting underprivileged children in Harlem, just as Princess Diana did in 1989. The couple will then attend a conservation reception at the British Consul General’s residence before watching the basketball match. On Tuesday they will visit the September 11 Memorial Museum, before touring a youth organisation and attending a reception to boost British tourism. Their final engagement is the 600th anniversary gala of St Andrews University, which they both attended, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess said of tonight’s reception: ‘It’s a private dinner that will comprise of supporters of the American Friends. The visit to the US is partly on behalf the Royal Foundation so it is entirely appropriate the Duke and Duchess meet supporters.’ Separately, The Mail on Sunday understands that Prince Charles will be making his own fundraising trip to New York later in the year.","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave for tour of New York tonight .

"Police officers in the NYPD have hit back at outraged protesters furious at the death of Eric Garner, a black man who died in a police chokehold, saying he brought it upon himself. Union officials and police supporters have seized on findings showing that Garner's asthma and obesity contributed to his death, and say they feel 'thrown under the bus' by demonstrations and politicians. They also said that more people should have been pointing out that Garner was wrong to resist arrest when confronted by officers in State Island, New York City, this July. Killing: Eric Garner was killed by an NYPD officer grabbing him round the neck. Officers have pointed out that Garner's size and health issues contributed . He was wrestled to the ground and repeatedly told officers 'I can't breathe' as white patrolman Daniel Pantaleo held him round the neck. He died in the wake of the confrontation - over the illegal sale of loose cigarettes - but a grand jury this week decided there would be no indictment over this death. The verdict, following close behind the decision not to charge officer Darren Wilson for shooting dead Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, prompted waves of ongoing protests - which have left officers sore. Mayor Bill de Blasio also weighed in, saying the case underscores the NYPD's need to improve relations with minorities. Policemen say the outcry has left them feeling betrayed and demonized by everyone from the president and the mayor to throngs of protesters who scream at them on the street. 'Police officers feel like they are being thrown under the bus,' said Patrick Lynch, president of the police union. Outraged: Police officers say they feel badly treated by widespread protests sparked by the case . But Lynch said: 'What we did not hear is this: You cannot go out and break the law. What we did not hear is that you cannot resist arrest. That's a crime.' At the noisy demonstrations that have broken out over the past few days, protesters have confronted police who had nothing to do with the case. Signs read: 'NYPD: Blood on your hands,' 'Racism kills' and 'Hey officers, choke me or shoot me.' Some demonstrators shouted, 'NYPD pigs!' More than 280 people have been arrested, and more demonstrations were planned Friday. In private and on internet chat rooms, officers have said they feel demoralized, misunderstood and 'all alone'. Some are advising each other that the best way to preserve their careers is to stop making arrests like that of Garner's, in defiance of the NYPD's campaign of cracking down on minor 'quality of life' offenses as a way to discourage serious crime. 'Everyone is just demonizing the police,' said Maki Haberfeld, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of criminal justice. 'But police follow orders and laws. Nobody talks about the responsibility of the politicians to explain to the community why quality-of-life enforcement is necessary.' Marches: People have called for police reform on the back of the Garner case. Union bosses say the message should be not to resist arrest . The fatal encounter occurred in July after Pantaleo and other police officers responded to complaints about Garner, a heavyset 43-year-old father of six. The video showed Garner telling officers to leave him alone and refusing to be handcuffed. Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran, appeared to wrap his arm around Garner's neck and take him down to the ground with the help of other officers. Garner could be heard saying, 'I can't breathe,' several times before he went motionless. The medical examiner later found that a chokehold resulted in Garner's death, but also that asthma, obesity and cardiovascular disease were contributing factors. While many have decried the death of another black man at the hands of a white officer, no evidence has come to light to suggest that Pantaleo's actions were racially motivated. His supervising sergeant at the scene was black, and so were some of the officers involved in the confrontation. As the video sparked accusations of excessive force, the police unions mounted a counter-narrative: that Garner would still be alive if he had obeyed orders, that his poor health was the main cause of his death and that Pantaleo had used an authorized takedown move - more like a headlock than a chokehold - to subdue him. While the grand jury proceedings were secret, Pantaleo's lawyer has said that the officer testified that he never tried to choke Garner and did not believe the man was in mortal danger. Pantaleo's defenders have included Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who argued that the grand jury outcome would have been the same if Garner had been white, and that police were right to ignore his pleas that he couldn't breathe. 'The fact that he was able to say it meant he could breathe,' said King, the son of a police officer. 'And if you've ever seen anyone locked up, anyone resisting arrest, they're always saying, `You're breaking my arm, you're killing me, you're breaking my neck.' So if the cops had eased up or let him go at that stage, the whole struggle would have started in again.'","Eric Garner was killed by officers in July who grabbed his neck .
