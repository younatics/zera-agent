"'SINDH KALAY', England (CNN) -- The aroma of freshly baking flatbread wafts through the air as a unit of British soldiers position themselves for a quick patrol around the village of Sindh Kalay. A British soldier on patrol in the mock Afghan village of Sindh Kalay. Market vendors hawk grapes and melons, as a group of village elders sit smoking water pipes and suspicious-looking men lurk beside battered motorcycles. What should the soldiers do? Conduct a weapons search? Approach the village elders first? In the complex political and cultural terrain of Afghanistan, what is the best course of action? Except this is not Afghanistan. It's Norfolk, England. Instead of the Hindu Kush mountains, it is the green ladscape and tidy farmhouses of the English countryside that stretch out behind them. Welcome to the British Army's state-of-the art training ground. It cost more than $20 million to build and every British soldier serving in Afghanistan will do his or her training here. ""I think it's the closest thing you are going to get short of being in Afghanistan itself,"" says Col. David Colthup of the 2nd Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment. His troops have already served one tour of duty in Afghanistan's Helmand province and are training for another. British troops serving in Helmand province are tasked with mentoring and training Afghan security forces. Not an easy job in a Taliban stronghold and Afghanistan's center of opium production. ""Ultimately, a soldier joins the army and trains to fight. That's what a soldier trains to do. But today, it's a much, much more complex environment,"" explains Colthup. ""The business of being able to interact either through an interpreter or through Afghan security forces, whether they are police or army. And to understand how the people operate and how we can interact better with them. Because ultimately, that's what it's about,"" he says. The most distinctive features of Sindh Kalay are the high three-meter walls that make up the village compound, creating narrow alleyways difficult for troops to patrol. The village is staffed with Afghan asylum-seekers, many of whom have fled the Taliban. They play the roles of market vendors, village elders and sometimes Afghan security forces. Several Afghan women are also on hand, useful for training British soldiers on the religious and cultural sensitivities of entering an Afghan home.  Watch British troops training in mock Afghan village » . The Taliban insurgents are played by Nepalese Ghurkha soldiers authorized to handle weapons. They play their roles silently, unable to partake in the Pashtun banter among the Afghans. Fazel Beria is also an asylum-seeker from Afghanistan. He is responsible for recruiting and for creating the sights and smells of Sindh Kalay and is easily identifiable as the only Afghan in the market in Western clothes. He beams with pride walking down the bazaar and clearly relishes his role in training the British Army. ""Everything with the culture comes up with the issue of hearts and minds,"" he explains. ""If you want to win that, you need to know about their culture. You need to respect their culture, their religion and their way of life."" He gives high marks to the soldiers training so far. After each exercise, the Afghan actors talk directly to the soldiers about what went wrong and what went right. Sometimes, it's the little things that count. ""Yes, there have been quite a lot of surprises,"" Beria says. Like Afghan will sit cross legged for hours. ""The British soldier cannot do that,"" he laughs. ""The Afghan will be sitting very comfortable and the British soldier is not. So, they have to get used to it.""  See photos of British troops on patrol in Sindh Kalay -- and for real in Afghanistan » . Previously, the army trained on farmhouses and in urban neighborhoods that resembled Northern Ireland more than Afghanistan. But Sindh Kalay does more than mimic the physical reality of Afghanistan. It also mirrors the changing tactics on the ground. Troops are grilled in IED training by amputees that act out the violence with latex wounds and fake blood. When a new IED tactic is discovered by troops in Afghanistan it is communicated to Sindh Kalay and put into practice immediately. ""Before we had this, it wasn't realistic enough,"" says Col. Richard Westley, head of training here. ""I think if you're going to be asking young men and women to go and risk their lives in someone else's country, then you have a moral obligation to prepare them for that environment. And that's what this village does. It gives them the isolation and complexity of an Afghan village. Which we can't do with farmhouses which represent Western Europe."" Some of the details in the Afghan village don't quite ring true. The slabs of lamb and beef hanging from the market stalls are plastic, as are the grapes and melons the vendors try and sell to the British soldiers. Still, Sindh Kalay is eerily effective. When soldiers sit down for a ""shura"" or meeting with village elders, helicopters buzz overhead and the soldiers seem surprised to be served a homemade yogurt and cucumber drink. But the unit commander can't help laughing when one of the Afghan village heads pulls out a ""list of damages"" by British troops. It turns out to be a receipt for the local supermarket.","British soldiers train in mock Afghan village before deployment to Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Two Baltimore, Maryland, police officers were shot Saturday after a gunman's domestic dispute led to shootings at two locations, a police spokesman told CNN. Crime scene tape cordons off a squad car involved in a chase and shootings Saturday in Baltimore. The rampage began at the home of the suspect's ex-girlfriend, who has a restraining order against him, police spokesman Don Moses said. The suspect, 34, forced his way into her home and they argued, Moses said. In an apparent rage, the man fired a round from a 9 mm Ruger, Moses said. The ex-girlfriend called police about 10:30 a.m. Moses described to CNN what unfolded next. Police have not released the names of anyone involved. Police received a call from the suspect's current girlfriend just before 11 a.m. She told them the suspect came to her home and assaulted her, and she suffered minor injuries. While a 42-year-old policeman was at her home tending to her report, the suspect called her. The officer talked to the suspect on the phone and convinced him to return to west Baltimore, where the girlfriend lived. When the suspect pulled up in a car, the officer approached him and was fired upon, suffering a gunshot wound to the buttocks. The wounded officer got into his patrol car and chased the suspect. An officer providing backup at the first shooting scene spotted the suspect's vehicle parked three blocks away. As the policeman observed the vehicle from inside his patrol car, the suspect appeared on the driver's side and fired at the officer. The backup officer, 44, who was wearing a bullet-proof vest, was shot in the chest and arm but managed to return fire, hitting the suspect three times. He was in stable condition after surgery and was expected to survive. The suspect is in custody and expected to live, Moses said. The officer shot in the buttocks was treated and released from the hospital Saturday.","Police spokesman: Rampage began at the home of the suspect's ex-girlfriend .

"(CNN) -- In these eco-conscious times, there are few areas of life that have not been touched by the drive to go green, and golf is no exception. Justin Timberlake has been an advocate of eco-golf at his course in Tennessee. The trend for environmentally friendly golf is rocketing with celebrities such as Justin Timberlake taking up the cause in unveiling one of the world's top eco-golf courses earlier this year. His club, the Mirimichi Golf Course in Tennessee is the first in the country to be designated as a certified Audubon International Classic Sanctuary, re-using 80 percent of the energy it produces. Next month Stockholm will host one of the largest meetings of American and European golf clubs to decide how the game can become more environmentally and socially responsible. Living Golf looks at a selection of some of the best eco-equipment making our greens even greener. The recyclable golf ball: . Every club player will be familiar with the age-old problem of losing golf balls -- but what happens to the collection of wayward balls once the search is over? Dixon Golf are asking for their customers to recycle their balls. It is estimated 300 million golf balls are discarded in the United States alone, every year -- that is enough balls to create a solid line from Los Angeles to London and back. Dixon Golf are encouraging golfers to recycle their lost and found by offering a dollar for each ball that is returned to their recycling centers throughout the US and in over 15 countries worldwide. ""We're getting the word out there. We don't have the advertising revenue of [bigger] companies but the more people know, the more they chose our eco-friendly balls. ""We're also developing our first prototype putter made entirely from recycled crushed golf balls,"" said company owner Mike Carey. The solar-powered cart: . Ever felt like your golf cart could do with that extra bit of oomph? Well, SolarDrive sun-powered, solar-paneled golf cart could be the answer. The SolarDrive sun-powered car - an energy solution for the future? By recharging itself throughout the day, the cart can work in drizzly and damp conditions -- which could be good news for golf lovers in rain-soaked Britain and sun-baked Abu Dhabi alike. The design has proved so popular that golf clubs such as the Jockey Club Kau Sai Chau Public Golf Course in Hong Kong and Sebonack Golf Club in the United States have recently converted entire fleets to use the power of the sun. General Manager at Sebonack Mark Hissey says it has been a great move for the club: ""First, it's a wonderful idea and second they look fantastic. Plus they're financially better for us to run, saving us over two-thirds on our electrical costs."" Large-scale gated communities in the UEA are also reportedly keen to use the carts as a more environmentally-friendly alternatives to gas-run vehicles. The biodegradable tee: . A littered tee box may be a thing of the past with the biodegradable golf tee. Manufacturers XT-1 believe they are saving over 100, 000 trees with their nifty corn based tee. The manufacturers of the XT-1 claim it will biodegrade within three months. Unlike wooden tees which take up to two years to degrade, XT-1s take just two to three months by way of an interesting eco-system. Once the tee comes in contact with the soil, the corn-based product is attacked by incredibly small microbes (or micro-bugs) that eat away at the tee to corrode the core. A slightly unusual method perhaps but an effective one, as sales in the last few years have soared. Manager Alan Berry told CNN: ""We're gaining interest all over the world -- Australia, the Middle-East, Europe and the States. Our sales figures speak for themselves.""","New developments in golf show that the sport has a drive to go green .

"(CNN) -- When Michele Maro became captivated by ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies, she never imagined she would one day be walking around in the Shire, touring Hobbiton and peeking into hobbit holes. Fans of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy can tour a New Zealand farm that was used as the setting for Hobbiton. Those are all fictional places, but fans can visit the closest thing possible in New Zealand, where the trilogy was filmed and where specially designed tours will take visitors to some of the stunning locations featured in the movies. Maro, who lives in St. Petersburg, Florida, spent two weeks in New Zealand in 2003 being guided around forests, national parks and farms, exploring sites that she didn't think were real when she first saw them on the big screen. ""The scenery was so pretty that I thought it had to be computer-generated,"" Maro said. But the place that moved her most was a serene sheep farm in Matamata, New Zealand, where filmmakers brought to life author J.R.R. Tolkien's vision of Hobbiton, the hobbit village where Frodo Baggins lives, complete with hobbit holes peeking out of hill sides. ""I just stood there and cried. It was like, 'I can't believe I'm actually here,' "" Maro said. ""I loved the movie so much, and to actually be there where they filmed that, it overwhelmed me.""  See iReporters' film location photos » . Sing along with 'The Sound of Music' Such passion has prompted tour operators all over the world to take fans to sites that have served as settings for blockbusters on the big and small screens. They can be legendary places recognized on their own or seemingly mundane restaurants, houses and street corners that become instantly recognizable when put in the context of a favorite movie or TV show. In London, England, you can visit locations used in movies such as ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" When in Rome, Italy, world-famous landmarks like the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain and the Colosseum will make you feel as if you've stepped right into ""Roman Holiday"" and ""La Dolce Vita."" Tours highlighting sites used during the filming of ""The Sound of Music"" have many visitors singing with joy in Salzburg, Austria. ""The buses were packed. It seemed to be very popular,"" said Kelly Van Baren, a sales manager who lives in suburban Chicago, Illinois. She and her sister watched the musical over and over while growing up, she recalled, and when they visited Munich, Germany, in the fall of 2007, they made a special one-hour train trip to Salzburg just to take one of the tours. It turned out to be an adventure in itself. A convoy of three huge buses with scenes from the film painted on their sides shuttled mostly American tourists to various sites, including the church where the main characters were married and a gazebo featured during some of the musical numbers, Van Baren recalled. Her favorite site was a majestic palace used as the von Trapp family home in some of the exterior shots. The movie was played on the bus during the tour, and the sightseers were encouraged to sing along, prompting Van Baren to wonder what the locals must think of the visitors. ""It was just hilarious, these three giant buses full of Americans driving around the countryside. It wasn't a proud moment, but it was fun,"" Van Baren said. Big Apple lures fans . Movie and TV fans who want to stay closer to home to explore famous locations have plenty of movie tours to choose from in the United States. New York, which has served as the backdrop for countless films and television shows, offers a wide variety of sites. Seeing them in person for the first time can be shocking, tour operators say. ""Guests are definitely surprised by the appearance of the locations,"" said Pauline Gacanja, public relations and marketing assistant for On Location Tours. ""On TV, things generally look larger and more dramatic than they really are."" The company takes about 100,000 visitors a year to dozens of well-known sites around the city by bus, by water taxi or on foot. Buildings used as homes in ""Friends"" and ""The Cosby Show"" are among the most popular places, Gacanja said. Visitors can also see locations such as the diner used in ""Men in Black"" and the firehouse used in ""Ghostbusters,"" according to the company's Web site. But the most popular tour focuses on sites used in the television and big screen hit ""Sex and the City,"" Gacanja said. Fans of ""the Sopranos"" also have their own tour. ""Seinfeld"" aficionados may opt for Kramer's Reality Tour, offered by Kenny ""The Real"" Kramer, the man said to have inspired Jerry's colorful friend Cosmo Kramer. Stops include the Soup Shop that inspired the ""Soup Nazi"" episode and the real Monk's Restaurant, used for the exterior shots of the diner where the characters hung out. This may be the only tour that tempts visitors with highlights such as ""Visit the office building where Elaine worked for Pendant Publishing, Kramer had his coffee table book published and George had sex, on his desk, with the cleaning lady."" Plenty of movie tours also thrive outside New York, in cities such as San Francisco, California; Boston, Massachusetts; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. For Maro, the experience in New Zealand was so unforgettable, she went again a year later for another look at ""The Lord of the Rings"" sites. ""My imagination went wild there. It was so fabulous. It was just a great trip,"" she said.","Tours take fans to sites that have served as settings for movies and TV shows .

"GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba (CNN)  -- Families of September 11 victims visiting Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Thursday urged the Obama administration to drop plans to close the facility and to restart terror trials there. A guard talks with a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, earlier this year. ""I am opposed to the closing of this facility because of political reasons,"" said Gordon Haberman whose daughter, Andrea, was killed when terrorist planes struck the World Trade Center. ""I believe that the current administration spoke too quickly on this."" Haberman said he thinks President Obama should not insist on carrying out his campaign pledge to shutter the detention facility. Haberman was one of nine people visiting Guantanamo this week who lost loved ones in the September 11 attacks. He and the others had the opportunity to observe pre-trial hearings for some suspects on Wednesday and Thursday. Several were critical of Obama's decision to suspend military commissions at Guantanamo Bay while the administration reviews what to do with each detainee. ""Our government's current executive order to halt the military commissions makes us foolish and weak, and invites more attacks,"" said Melissa Long, whose boyfriend was a first responder killed in New York. ""What is fair and just is to continue the military commissions and punish those who have committed acts of terrorism against Americans, period."" Long later married a man who lost his parents when their plane slammed into the Pentagon on that fateful day. Brian Long acknowledged that some of the detainees may have gone through some inhumane treatment through the years, but he thinks they are being well taken care of now. ""The only injustice is being orchestrated by our leader by making decisions about something he knew nothing about,"" Long said. Other September 11 families have visited Guantanamo Bay for previous hearings and voiced support for using the facility for terror trials. The government uses a random process to select names of family members invited to observe. The family members said they think Guantanamo detainees have been provided with good attorneys, who, in many cases, are paired with clients who don't want their help. Some of that was on display at a hearing Thursday for five detainees charged with orchestrating the September 11 attacks, including Khalid Sheik Mohammed. Mohammed and fellow prisoner Ramzi Binalshibh refused to come to the proceeding, after being told no detainees would be allowed to make statements. Three others did show up. But one, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, left quickly because he was not allowed to talk to the judge about problems he said he was having with one of his military lawyers. All five September 11 suspects want to act as their own attorneys. Thursday's hearing focused on discussions about the competence of al-Hawsawi and Binalshibh to stand trial and represent themselves. Mohammed and two others have been granted permission to defend themselves.","Families of September 11 victims urge Obama to keep Guantanamo Bay open .

"ANTIOCH, California (CNN) -- Investigators who completed their search of the California property belonging to kidnapping suspects Phillip and Nancy Garrido said initial findings do not connect the couple to the disappearances of two young girls. Ilene Misheloff, left, has been missing since 1989; Michaela Garecht disappeared in 1988. But police said that they have not eliminated Phillip Garrido as a suspect in the decades-old cases. Bone fragments found on the couple's property near Antioch could be human but are ""far too old to be relevant in our cases,"" said Lt. Chris Orrey of the Hayward police department. Teeth found on an adjacent property are most likely from an animal, she said. And some anomalies found by ground-penetrating radar uncovered ""chunks of concrete, tree roots, and in one case a floor mat,"" Orrey said at a news conference. Investigators had already found bone fragments at the property in unincorporated Contra Costa County, but have not said if they are human. ""Although nothing [was found] that would definitively link Phillip and Nancy Garrido to the disappearance of Ilene Misheloff or Michaela Garecht, we're going to continue to follow up on the evidence that we have recovered,"" Lt. Kurt von Savoye of the Dublin Police Department said at the news conference. ""We're going to examine and process all items that have been taken from this property to see if there is any possible link to the Garridos."" The processing of all the evidence could take several weeks, Orrey said. Police from Hayward and Dublin began executing search warrants simultaneously last week on the Garrido property and an adjacent property to which he had access. They sought any evidence in the 1988 abduction of 9-year-old Michaela Garecht of Hayward and the 1989 disappearance of 13-year-old Ilene Misheloff of Dublin. The search of the adjacent property was also completed and the resident will be able to return soon, police said. The Garridos' home will remain boarded up and the fence locked, Orrey said. The Garridos face a combined 29 felony counts in the 1991 kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard, then 11, from South Lake Tahoe, California. Authorities say the couple held Dugard in a hidden compound behind their home for 18 years and have said Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender, fathered her two children. Phillip Garrido won't be eliminated as a suspect because of similarities in the Dugard case and the other disappearance cases, Orrey said. ""I can't help but feel relief that they didn't find anything here,"" Michaela's mother, Sharon Murch, told reporters. ""If they had found something on this property, it most likely would have meant Michaela wasn't alive.""","Police say they haven't eliminated Phillip Garrido as suspect in girls' disappearances .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- It was a heartwarming sight: Laura Ling and Euna Lee landing on U.S. soil and being reunited with their families. To the elation of their families, Bill Clinton returned to the U.S. with journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee. Then, after an appropriate amount of time for hugs and kisses, Bill Clinton appeared, descending from his movie-producer friend's plane like an angel from heaven. An emotional Ling practically referred to the former president as a messiah, describing to the media and well-wishers waiting at the airport how she and Lee thought they were being sent to a hard-labor camp, only to walk through a door to find Clinton. The crowd broke into loud applause. For all of those who wondered what Bill would do in Hillary Clinton's diplomatic world, wonder no longer. As details of the Clinton mission came out, it was revealed that the North Koreans themselves asked for Clinton, promising amnesty for the women upon delivery of the former president, whose visit eluded them while he was in office. The deal was done even before Clinton stepped on the plane. So what is next for Bill Clinton? If the mere thought of a meeting with him is enough to move a regime notorious for never moving, can the Obama administration use that star power to rescue three American hikers who ventured into Iran and are believed to be held by Iranian authorities? Can Clinton head off two Russian attack submarines cruising in the Atlantic off the East Coast of the United States? Former presidents are used as envoys and undertake humanitarian missions all the time. Then-President Clinton used former President Jimmy Carter to travel to North Korea in 1994 to negotiate the end to the first nuclear crisis. Clinton and his predecessor, George H.W. Bush, were tapped by Bush's son, then-President George W. Bush, to lead relief efforts to help Asian and African nations devastated by the 2004 tsunami and again in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina. But the relationship between Bill and Hillary Clinton and President Obama is complex, to say the least. After a bitter-fought battle during the Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton supporters were looking for a robust role for her in exchange for her support of Obama, with many even suggesting her as a possible candidate for vice president. That idea was short-lived. The Obama team wanted Hillary far from the West Wing. And they wanted Bill even farther. When Obama tapped Hillary to be his secretary of state, there was no shortage of critics who asserted that her husband's global foundation and role as a high-paid public speaker would present a conflict of interest. The Clintons agreed to strict rules of the road to avoid such conflicts going forward. However Hillary never demurred in her praise for what her husband has accomplished, both during his eight years in the White House or post-presidency. Hillary herself has said she considered her husband a trusted adviser and could even consider using him where appropriate. He is a former president, after all. Bill Clinton has largely stayed out of the limelight, quietly continuing his globetrotting on behalf of the world's poor and downtrodden. In May, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appointed him as the United Nations' special envoy to Haiti in an effort to refocus international attention on the Caribbean country's deep economic problems and environmental decay. But with the success of his North Korean mission so quick and easy, it's conceivable that Bill Clinton could add the role of ""diplomatic cleaner"" to his resume -- a version of Harvey Keitel's role as Winston Wolfe in the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" -- a fixer of messy problems, which he solves with a combination of stylish charisma and lucid thinking under pressure. The Obama administration has no shortage of messy foreign policy problems that Hillary Clinton knows could use a Winston Wolfe.","Spotlight returns to Bill Clinton after successful mission to North Korea .

"(CNN)  -- In the seven weeks since the military-backed bloodless coup in Honduras, several hundred people protesting against the de facto government have been arbitrarily arrested and beaten by government forces, a new Amnesty International report says. The marks of a police truncheon are shown on a student's back after a protest, Amnesty International says. The report, released Wednesday, said the beatings were meant to punish those who opposed the ouster of President Manuel Zelaya in June. It includes testimony from, and photographs of, several people who were baton-whipped and detained by police officers who sometimes wore no visible identification and hid their faces behind bandanas as they broke up demonstrations. ""They beat us if we raised our heads; they beat us when they were getting us into the police cars,"" said a student whom Amnesty International interviewed in late July at the police station where he was being detained. ""They said, 'Cry and we'll stop.'"" Multiple requests to the government for comment went unanswered. The government has said in the past that the demonstrators were arrested for engaging in violence and provoking authorities. The Honduran political crisis stems from Zelaya's defiant push to hold a referendum that could have led to extending term limits by changing the constitution. The country's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal. He was ousted in a coup on June 28. The congress named Roberto Micheletti provisional president shortly after the military detained Zelaya and sent him into exile. Micheletti and his supporters deny that a coup took place, calling the action a constitutional transfer of power. The coup resulted in unrest throughout the country, with frequent clashes between police and military on one side and civilian protesters on the other. At least two people were shot to death, Amnesty said. Among several examples, the Amnesty report quotes F.M., a 52-year-old teacher, who said he was demonstrating peacefully when police descended on the rally. ""They grabbed me and shouted, 'Why do you (all) support Zelaya's government?' They beat me. I have not been informed as to why I am detained."" He showed deep-red imprints on his back, which he said were from a beating with a baton. ""Detention and ill treatment of protesters are being employed as a form of punishment for those openly opposing the de facto government and also as a deterrent for those contemplating taking to the streets to peacefully show their discontent with the political turmoil the country is experiencing,"" said Esther Major, Amnesty's Central America researcher.","President Manuel Zelaya was ousted in a bloodless coup in June .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama urged Congress to adopt a ""pay-as-you-go"" approach to federal spending in order to restore fiscal discipline, but critics say the president's call lacks credibility. Preisdent Obama says PAYGO is common sense. Faced with a record $1.8 trillion deficit, Obama on Tuesday pushed Congress to take up the spending rules, known as PAYGO. The approach would require lawmakers to pay for new programs, dollar-for-dollar, with budget cuts elsewhere. ""The 'pay as you go' rule is very simple. Congress can only spend a dollar if it saves a dollar elsewhere,"" Obama said, as he announced that he was submitting to Congress a proposal to make PAYGO law. Obama repeated his vow to halve the deficit by the end of his first term, and he said PAYGO is an important step toward making that happen. A previous PAYGO mandate helped erase federal budget deficits in the 1990s, and subsequent ineffective rules contributed to the current budget deficits, Obama said. ""Paying for what you spend is basic common sense. Perhaps that's why, here in Washington, it has been so elusive,"" the president said Tuesday.  Watch more on Obama's 'pay-as-you-go' plan » . But Republicans were quick to question the administration's sincerity. Republican Whip Eric Cantor charged that the administration's focus on PAYGO ""seems more driven by polling and PR strategy than a serious commitment to fiscal discipline."" ""It seems a tad disingenuous for the President and Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi to talk about PAYGO rules after ramming trillions in spending through Congress proposing policies that create more debt in the first six months of this year than in the previous 220 years combined,"" Cantor, R-Virginia, said in a statement Tuesday. Republicans point to the $787 billion stimulus package as evidence that Obama is not following his own advice. Cantor's statement included a ""fiscal timeline"" highlighting government spending initiatives this year. The timeline entry for June 8 points to polls showing dissatisfaction with the administration on spending and the deficit. The entry for June 9 shows the president holding a PAYGO summit. However, a group of fiscally conservative Democratic representatives known as the Blue Dogs say Obama's proposal is responsible and necessary. ""President Obama inherited an economy in free fall and a $10.6 trillion national debt,"" said Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee, vice chairman of the Blue Dog Budget and Financial Services Task Force. ""While short-term spending was necessary to get the economy moving again, our long-term fiscal problems became that much more urgent."" But when it comes to reducing the deficit, even the Senate Budget Committee's Democratic chairman doubts the president can deliver on his promise. Asked if Obama could halve the deficit -- given the recent government spending --- Sen. Kent Conrad said, ""I don't believe so. I don't believe anybody could."" Administration officials still defend piling the stimulus spending on top of the deficit, arguing that it was the best approach to get the country out of the recession. ""Pay-as-you-go embodies a common sense principle that you shouldn't dig a hole deeper,"" said Peter Orszag, director of the Office of Management and Budget. CNN's Kristi Keck and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Approach requires Congress to balance spending increases with equal savings .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- At least 43 people are feared dead after a massive mudslide swept away three hamlets in northern India, authorities said Sunday. Two small villages were completely destroyed Saturday while one was partially knocked down, said Manoj Pande, a senior disaster management official in Pithoragarh district. Rescuers have pulled 15 bodies from the debris and many more may have been swept into the river, Pande said. More than 2.9 million people in India have been affected by floods since June, according to federal officials. Yearly monsoon rains sweep across the subcontinent from June till September. Though they bring much-needed relief to often-parched farmlands, they also leave a trail of landslides, home collapses and often fatal floods.","Three hamlets affected by recent mudslide in India .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- The French are in for a significant cultural shift next week if the Senate approves a new law from President Nicolas Sarkozy to allow more shops to open on Sundays. The law would permit shops, department stores, and shopping malls to open on Sundays in 20 zones. What seems routine in much of the Western world has been fiercely resisted in France, where Sundays have officially been set aside as a day of rest for more than a century and where a 35-hour workweek remains the norm. The new legislation, if approved by the Senate, would overturn a 1906 law that forbids Sunday trading in all but the largest cities. It is part of a raft of reforms Sarkozy has pushed for since becoming president. While the change is significant, it is not as much as the government originally hoped because Sarkozy had to deal with opposition from both the left and the right. Socialists filed thousands of amendments to the president's original version of the law. Leftists and unions said it would effectively introduce a seven-day workweek and allow bosses to force employees to work Sundays. Members of the president's own ruling conservative party opposed the law despite assurances it would boost economic activity, saying it would instead deprive families and church groups of their dedicated day. If approved by the Senate, the law would permit shops, department stores, and shopping malls to open on Sundays in 20 zones of what are called ""exceptional commercial"" centers near three of the country's largest cities: Paris, Marseilles, and Lille. Additionally, 29 areas involving about 500 cities and towns would be added to the list of tourist areas, which already allow some economic activity on Sundays. The new law will, among other things, straighten out a somewhat chaotic situation in which some stores managed to obtain exceptions from the old law and others didn't, and where some stores found it made more sense financially to accept fines for breaking the old law because the income from Sunday sales more than made up for the penalties. The measure passed the National Assembly last Tuesday by a vote of 282 to 238. It will go the Senate for three days of debate next Tuesday, where it is almost certain to be approved. Opinion polls in France show that slightly more than half the population want shops to have the freedom to open on Sundays, according to Time magazine.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Afghanistan's reputation as the world's leading narcotics supplier is well-known, but in a squalid ruin in Kabul, the country hides a darker secret -- a huge home grown drug addiction problem now on the brink of fueling an HIV/AIDS epidemic. Junkies smoking heroin can get high for $4. Here junkies lie in their own filth, wasted limbs poking out of blood-spattered clothing as they blank out the abject misery of their surroundings. In one room, a veritable narcotics bazaar offers pills and drug paraphernalia -- with hits retailing at less than $4. One user claims he has been an addict for 22 years, although it is difficult to talk to any of the dazed and ragged occupants of the drug rooms. The atmosphere is edgy and -- as thick clouds of burning opium fill the air -- dizzyingly toxic. The Kabul den is just the tip of the iceberg in a country awash with narcotics. The government estimates the number of addicts in Afghanistan could be as many as five percent of its 25 million people.  Watch Nic Robertson's report from the 'house of hopelessness' » . And though nascent efforts are being made to tackle the problem, chronic funding shortfalls have prompted the United Nations to warn that drug use will escalate, potentially driving an HIV/AIDS crisis as junkies move from smoking to high risk needle-sharing. Afghanistan has always been a major narcotics supplier -- responsible for 95 percent of the world's heroin -- although this was scaled back under the rule of the Taliban, which outlawed poppy cultivation and imposed strict penalties for drug users. Since 2001, when the extremist regime was ousted by a U.S.-led invasion that installed President Hamid Karzai, production has doubled. And for many in the country still mired in poverty and conflict, these cheap drugs offer a tempting escape. The last United Nations survey of Afghanistan's drug problem four years ago estimated the country's addicts to number about 200,000. According to Afghan Counter Narcotics Minister Khodaidad, the figure is now far greater. ""More than 1.2 million people in Afghanistan are addicts. It's a very huge number and every year it increases,"" he told CNN. Khodaidad says the Afghan government is largely powerless to control the production of opium while Taliban extremists, who now control and draw funding from drug crops, control cultivation areas despite major international military efforts to push them back. ""We did very little due to weakness of governors, due to insurgents, due to pressure of terrorism in the area,"" he added. ""We don't have sufficient law enforcement agencies -- the police, the border security force, and other special forces to control this area -- so it will take time."" But, says Jean-Luc Lemahieu, head of the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Kabul, time is something Afghanistan does not have. As intravenous drug use takes hold, raising the prospect of needle sharing, he says HIV/AIDS will follow quickly. ""The little data we have at the moment are very alarming,"" he told CNN. ""They tell us that we should not wait longer and if not, this country will be saddled with another burden it just can not afford. ""I think it is already happening today. We have seen, now, a few HIV/AIDS cases. Hopefully we can contain the problem, although it is unlikely given the problems with the health structures."" The U.N. has begun a program to detox users willing to get off drugs in Afghanistan. A renovated warehouse in Kabul offers hope to 100 addicts in the biggest facility of its kind in the country.  Watch Robertson go inside the detox clinic » . In the center's clean, bare rooms, shaven-headed junkies tremble under blankets as they go through the agonizing cold turkey of weaning their ravaged bodies off drug dependency. Therapy sessions also help motivate them to kick their deadly habit. ""Here we deal with the problem from a humanitarian perspective, not from an addiction perspective, to save lives,"" says Jehan Zeb Khan, UNODC program manager. But says Khan, with what little funding there is now dwindling fast, the salvation offered to these lucky few may be short lived -- they will be forced back out on the streets, where more opium dens will flourish, bringing yet more misery for Afghanistan.","Government officials say 1.2 million Afghans are now addicted to drugs .

"(CNN) -- There is more water on the moon in more locations than originally thought, a discovery that may bolster NASA's long-held goal of setting up an outpost there, a researcher said Thursday. NASA says there is more water on the moon in more locations than originally thought. One ton of the moon's surface -- in which the water's ingredients are held -- could yield as much as 32 ounces, or one quart, of water, according to three reports from research teams who studied data from three spacecrafts. Although that amount isn't large, said geological sciences professor Jack Mustard, the findings show ""there are ways you could convert these amounts of water into higher amounts"" that could support human activity. The water was discovered in rocky environments and in craters, Mustard said. ""It's in more places and in different places than were inferred previously,"" he said. Since the Apollo missions began in the 1960s, scientists have believed the moon was virtually dry. Only trace amounts of water were found in rocks and soil brought back to Earth, and that water may have resulted from contamination during the retrieval process, scientists said.  Watch report on discovery of more sources of moon water » . Mustard was on a team led by Carle Pieters, science manager of the NASA-supported Keck Reflectance Experiment Laboratory at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Pieters also is principal investigator for NASA's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), which the space agency contributed to India's first mission to the moon, Chandrayaan-1, in October 2008. The mapper was a ""state-of-the-art imaging spectrometer"" that provided the first map of the entire lunar surface at high resolution, revealing the minerals of which it is made. Examining data from Chandrayaan-1, Pieters' team found signs of water at the moon's frigid poles. The researchers believe it might have migrated from elsewhere on the moon's surface, attracted by the cold, they said. Their overall findings also were confirmed by data from a high-tech spectrometer on the Cassini spacecraft -- which also found evidence of water at lower latitudes away from the poles -- and from infrared mapping done by the Deep Impact spacecrafts -- which found trace amounts over much of the moon's surface. Reports on those findings came from teams led by Roger Clark of the U.S. Geological Survey and Jessica Sunshine of the University of Maryland. This most recent information is far more precise than any previous data, Mustard said. Previous measurements were ""the size of Texas, say, and now are the size of Providence."" ""We find it (water) distributed more broadly,"" he added. In the late 1990s, scientists found pockets of hydrogen on the moon, and inferred that its molecules could bond with oxygen to make water, the professor said. He called the older information much coarser. This time, researchers are reassured that the components are on the moon to make water because of the presence of hydroxyl -- produced when hydrogen and oxygen also bond with a mineral structure. The researchers said the results also suggest that the molecules are continually being created on the lunar surface, perhaps as a result of the solar wind -- the stream of ionized particles ejected by the sun. The research reports were being posted Thursday by the journal Science, at the Science Express Web site, www.sciencexpress.org, and will be in the magazine that comes out Friday. A news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday afternoon in Washington.","NASA says there are small amounts of water in lunar soil .

"(CNN) -- Texas authorities on Sunday were searching for a convicted burglar who escaped from a medical facility by rappelling off the building using a string of bedsheets, officials said. Joshua Duane Barnes, 21, was serving 35 years in prison for several convictions, including two escape charges. Joshua Duane Barnes, 21, was last seen at 8:15 p.m. Saturday on the seventh floor of a Texas Department of Criminal Justice medical facility in Galveston, Texas, said TDCJ spokesman Jason Clark. Fifteen minutes later, Barnes was gone, Clark told CNN. Security officers noticed there was a hole in the wall and a vent had been removed. According to Clark, Barnes busted a hole through a wall in his room and then broke through a thick window. He apparently tied bedsheets together, rappelled down the side of the building to a roof, and then jumped to the ground, Clark said. Barnes was serving 35 years in prison for several felony convictions, including seven burglary charges, two escape charges and an aggravated assault charge in the Texas Panhandle area, according to a TDCJ press release. The inmate was being housed at a prison in Midway, Texas. He was transported to the medical facility in Galveston last week after being hurt in an altercation, TDCJ said. The department of criminal justice has tracking dogs and dozens of officers searching the area, Clark said. Local police officers also joined the search. Barnes began serving his sentence in January.

"A Saudi Arabian man who was arrested for bragging about his sex life on television has apologized for his comments while Saudi authorities discuss whether he should be charged with a crime, according to local media. Mazen Abdul Jawad appeared earlier this month on Lebanese channel LBC's show ""Red Lines,"" on which he discussed foreplay, sexual conquests and how he picks up women, all taboo subjects in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia. According to the Saudi daily newspaper Arab News, Abdul Jawad has initiated a damage-control campaign and on Sunday ""appeared in the pages of a local newspaper apparently wiping away tears from a handkerchief as he apologized and begged for forgiveness."" Abdul Jawad is a 32-year-old airline employee and divorced father of four. In Saudi Arabia, pre-marital sex is illegal and unrelated men and women are not allowed to mingle. According to Arab News, Abdul Jawad is not in jail and is considering filing a complaint against the show's producers for presenting him ""in the worst possible manner by taking two hours of footage and condensing it down to a minutes-long segment."" Ashraf Al-Sarraj, the lawyer representing Abdul Jawad in his possible complaint against LBC, told Arab News, ""We will study the case and eventually present it to the Ministry of Information."" According to the paper, ""LBC refused to comment on the matter until it has more time to formulate a response."" The segment in question has, since its initial broadcast, been posted on YouTube and been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. It includes scenes of Abdul Jawad discussing his enjoyment of sex and how he lost his virginity at age 14. Abdul Jawad is also shown in his bedroom, where he holds up sexual aids to the camera. It ends with him cruising the streets of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in his car and looking for women.

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A desperate Zimbabwean farmer fighting to hold onto his land -- a year after the country's political rivals pledged to govern jointly -- fears he will eventually lose to politics and violence. Ben Freeth's farm was gutted by fire, as was his father-in-law's. The power-sharing agreement included an undertaking by both parties to ensure property rights are upheld but farm attacks and invasions continue unabated in Zimbabwe. Charles Lock is one of an estimated 400 farmers who have remained in the country despite President Robert Mugabe's policy of redistributing white-owned farms to landless blacks. ""Why do they want to remove me when I've complied with everything they want? What more do they want other than for me to pack my bags and leave and if that's the case, then admit that that is the policy. Pass a law: no whites are allowed to farm. Then it makes it clear,"" Lock said. Since 2000, Mugabe's controversial land reform program has driven more than 4,000 commercial farmers off their land, destroying Zimbabwe's once prosperous agricultural sector. ""When the land reform program began, we decided we were not going to have a confrontational attitude; that we would actually go along with this program because it was the only way that this whole thing would be sorted out. So I voluntarily gave away my own farm and moved onto my father-in-law's farm,"" Lock said. That was in 2002. A year later the government came knocking on his door again, he said, demanding more land. Lock told CNN he eventually gave up 70 percent of his father-in-law's farm, which he then owned. Now an army general is demanding Lock's remaining 30 percent. When Zimbabwe's new unity government was formed -- with Mugabe's ZANU-PF and Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change -- in February this year, the general allegedly posted soldiers on Lock's farm. The farmer said he stopped farming and trade at gun point. When CNN visited Lock's farm this month, workers were standing idle. Maize and tobacco, which Lock said is worth more than U.S. $1 million, lay in storage. ""They've switched off our irrigation system, taken out keys and stop our trucks if we want to deliver maize,"" he told CNN. So Lock had to sneak into his own property like a thief by cutting open the gate leading to his store room. He took a few valuables from his workshop suspecting that his whole place will soon be looted. With the formation of a unity government farmers were hoping for some protection but Lock said: ""Nothing is happening here. There is no land audit happening, no one comes out here to check, to see. We are just left vulnerable."" On another farm, Ben Freeth's fight for his land has just escalated to another level. Freeth has been repeatedly beaten, arrested and harassed. Now his farmhouse and that of his father-in-law have been gutted by a mysterious fire. See the destruction the fire caused . Freeth could not say for sure that this is arson but told CNN that the group of ZANU-PF youths who have occupied his farm have repeatedly threatened to burn his house. ""One time they came round with burning sacks at night and they started making a huge noise and ringing a great big bell and shouting and screaming. They were going underneath the thatch saying we are going to burn your house down if you don't get out,"" he said. Freeth and his father-in-law Mike Campbell are among a group of Zimbabwean farmers who won the right to remain on their land at a southern African tribunal. But Mugabe has declared the ruling null and void and pulled out of the tribunal. Farmers cannot contest land issues in Zimbabwe and approaching international courts has thus far not worked either. When CNN interviewed Mugabe's minister of state, Didymas Mutasa, about the disregard for human and property rights on the farms, he blamed the farmers for the violence, saying landless blacks are getting frustrated with their refusal to relinquish their land. ""Human rights are beginning to be seen now because they benefit the whites, and when they were affecting blacks badly as they did the likes of us, it didn't matter and nobody raised anything about those human rights. ""And sometimes we say, good heavens, if that is the kind of human rights you are talking about, you better keep them away from us; we don't want to see them,"" he told CNN. But it is black farm workers who are caught in the cross fire. They continue to bear the brunt of the land reform program by repeatedly being beaten and intimidated. Some have even been killed. Tractor driver William Kale said it is farm laborers working for white farmers who are targeted. ""They actually say you the workers, you are ones that are supporting the white farmer. That is why he is carrying on farming and we refuse to go because we have nowhere to go,"" Kale told CNN. Many farmers and farm workers we spoke to say they are in a worse position now under the unity government than they were before. Lock said: ""When ZANU-PF was in power, you had hawks and doves in government and the doves were approachable and often helped us. But now that these positions are being shared with Mr. Tsvangirai's MDC, Mr. Mugabe has only appointed hawks to his cabinet who insist on continuing the land reform program. And when it comes to the MDC, the land issue seems to be a hot potato they do not want to touch. I have asked Mr. Tsvangirai to intervene but nothing is happening."" Prime Minister Tsvangirai refuted that. ""That is not true,"" he said. ""We initiated to find out who is being affected, the few remaining white farmers. Let's be frank here, we are talking of farmers as being white, but to me any destruction of farm production affects the whole viability of agriculture. There should be no disruption of any farm activity."" To those under siege these words are little comfort as they continue to fight a battle they are unlikely to win.","Zimbabwe white farmers battle continuing policy of land redistribution .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- North Korea's rhetoric toward the United States has always had a certain bizarre, over-the-top quality to it. Under the Bush administration it labeled Undersecretary of State John Bolton ""human scum."" ""Complete and irreversible denuclearization is the only viable path for North Korea,"" Hillary Clinton says. But the North Korea's latest comments about Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are stunningly personal. An unnamed North Korean official quoted by the state-run KCNA news agency calls Clinton ""by no means intelligent"" and a ""funny lady."" ""Sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping,"" he said. The remarks seem to be a reply to Clinton's comments to ABC News in which she compared North Korea's leadership to ""small children and unruly teenagers and people who are demanding attention."" Behind the scenes, U.S officials for months have made similar comparisons, claiming the Pyonyang's modus operandi is to be deliberately provocative, to ""act out"" to get the United States' attention and be rewarded for its ""misbehavior."" This time, they say, it's not going to work. Clinton said Pyonyang has ""no friends left."" After North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test in May and fired several ballistic missiles over Japan, the United States rallied the United Nations to pass resolution 1874, which invoked strong sanctions, including targeting top North Korean officials connected to Pyonyang's nuclear program. Significantly, the resolution was supported by Russia and China, countries that have been reluctant to impose strict sanctions on North Korea. ""Complete and irreversible denuclearization is the only viable path for North Korea,"" Clinton said at the Association of Southeast Asia Nations meeting in Thailand this week. ""We do not intend to reward North Korea just for returning to the table, nor do we intend to reward them for actions they have already committed to taking and then reneged on. The path is open to them, and it is up to them to follow it. Unless and until they do, they will face international isolation and the unrelenting pressure of global sanctions."" North Korea, however, says the six-party talks with the United States, South Korea, Russia, China and Japan are dead and it's not going back. The country has the right to a nuclear program, it says, since it must defend itself against possible attack from the United States. With strong words on both sides, the standoff seems intractable. Clinton maintains the door still is open to the North, but only if Pyonyang does what it already has committed to: resume talks and dismantle its nuclear program -- completely, irreversibly and verifiably. ""We have made it very clear to the North Koreans that if they will agree to irreversible denuclearization the United States, as well as our partners, will move forward on a package of incentives and opportunities, including normalizing relations that will give the people of North Korea a better future,"" she said. But a North Korean official, quoted by South Korean news agency Yonhap, calls the package of incentives ""nonsense."" ""The U.S. is telling us to take off all of our clothes,"" he's quoted as saying. ""The most important thing for us is sovereignty. Sovereignty, security, namely life, should be guaranteed. How can we barter life with money?""","""Sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl,"" official reportedly says of Clinton .

"(CNN) -- A leading international children's charity has warned that Elton John's desire to adopt a 14-month-old baby boy could lead to more children being abandoned. Elton John kisses baby Lev during his visit to the orphanage in Ukraine on Saturday. The singer, 62, made the announcement during a visit with his partner, 46-year-old David Furnish, to an orphanage for HIV-affected children in Ukraine on Saturday. ""David always wanted to adopt and I always said no because I am 62 and I think because of the traveling I do and the life I have, maybe it wouldn't be fair for the child,"" he told reporters. ""But having seen Lev today, I would love to adopt him. I don't know how we do that but he has stolen my heart. And he has stolen David's heart and it would be wonderful if we can have a home. I've changed my mind today."" While EveryChild praised the British musician for helping raise awareness of children affected by HIV/AIDS, it said international adoption is sending out the wrong message. James Georgalakis, EveryChild's Communications and Advocacy Manager, told CNN: ""Research conducted in the Ukraine in 2007 which showed high-profile celebrity adoptions and news around foreigners coming into the country and adopting children generally was actually encouraging vulnerable young mothers to abandon their children into homes hoping their child would be adopted by a rich foreigner and have a better life. ""So it's quite well documented that these high-profile adoptions could actually be increasing the number of children in institutions."" Do you think celebrity adoptions are a good thing? According to research by the charity's Web site, 95 percent of the children in Ukraine's institutions are not orphans, with babies born to HIV+ mothers facing particular discrimination. They are separated from their mothers and often end up in children's homes and institutions segregated from children not affected by HIV. It argues that governments such as Ukraine need to be encouraged to put more emphasis on keeping families together rather than placing them in outdated Soviet-era children's homes. ""After a great deal of campaigning by charities such as ours, the Ukraine government introduced a new 'gate-keeping' system which means the authorities will have to consider all available options before a child is placed in an institution,"" Georgalakis said. ""So when a child is taken into care or abandoned, they will have look at whether a child has other family or can be fostered by another family for example. This is a huge step forward and one that needs support. ""We will definitely be speaking to Elton and his representatives about this."" Elton John is the latest high-profile figure to be linked with a case of this kind. Earlier this year, Madonna won a court appeal to adopt a second child from Malawi. Critics of the pop-star accused the pop superstar of taking advantage of ""archaic adoption laws"" in a bid to adopt three-year-old Chifundo James. Madonna's initial attempt was denied because she did not meet a residency law that requires applicants to have lived in the country for some time before adoption. This condition was waived when Madonna -- and then husband Guy Ritchie -- adopted her first Malawian child, David Banda. The judge in that case said the interest of the child outweighed the issue of residency. Meanwhile, the British Association for Adoption and Fostering said around 4,000 children need to be adopted in UK each year, with many facing a considerable wait. BAAF Chief Executive David Holmes told CNN: ""While Elton John may be considered too old under current guidance to adopt a baby in the UK, there are many children, particularly older children, sibling groups, children with disabilities, and children from black minority groups, all waiting for a family. ""We'll certainly be reinforcing this message during National Adoption Week in Britain later this year.""","Elton John, 62, made announcement during a visit to an orphanage in Ukraine .

"(CNN)  -- President Obama has ordered national security officials to look into allegations that the Bush administration resisted efforts to investigate a CIA-backed Afghan warlord over the killings of hundreds of Taliban prisoners in 2001. In an exclusive, CNN talked with President Obama in Ghana about his order to review alleged deaths of Taliban. ""The indications that this had not been properly investigated just recently was brought to my attention,"" Obama told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview during the president's visit to Ghana. The full interview will air 10 p.m. Monday. ""So what I've asked my national security team to do is to collect the facts for me that are known, and we'll probably make a decision in terms of how to approach it once we have all of the facts gathered up,"" Obama said. The inquiry stems from the deaths of at least 1,000 Taliban prisoners who had surrendered to the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance in late 2001. The fighters were in the custody of troops led by Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, a prominent Afghan warlord who has served as chief of staff of the country's post-Taliban army. Dostum, a former communist union boss and militia leader who fought against the U.S.-backed mujahedeen in the 1980s, is known for switching sides as Afghanistan's political conflict has evolved. When the United States invaded Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, Dostum sided with the Americans and received military and CIA support to battle the Taliban. The allegations against him first surfaced in a 2002 Newsweek report, which cited a confidential U.N. memo saying the prisoners died in cramped container trucks while being transported from their Konduz stronghold in northern Afghanistan to Sheberghan prison, west of Dostum's stronghold at Mazar-e Sharif. At the time, the Boston, Massachusetts-based group Physicians for Human Rights said it found a mass grave in nearby Dasht-e Leili, where witnesses said the bodies of Taliban prisoners were buried. The finding prompted U.S. Gen. Tommy Franks, who led the invasion of Afghanistan, to support an investigation into the allegations. But The New York Times, citing government officials and human rights organizations, reported Friday that the Bush administration ""repeatedly discouraged efforts to investigate the episode."" State Department officials recently have tried to derail Dostum's reappointment as military chief of staff to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the newspaper reported, citing several senior officials who suggested the administration ""might not be hostile to an inquiry."" Dostum, a key ally of Karzai, was reportedly living in exile in Turkey until last month, when he was reinstated to his post as defense minister. He had left Afghanistan over allegations that he had kidnapped Akbar Bai, a former ally turned political rival. When asked by CNN about whether Obama would support an investigation, the president replied, ""I think that, you know, there are responsibilities that all nations have, even in war. And if it appears that our conduct in some way supported violations of laws of war, then I think that, you know, we have to know about that.""  Watch part of CNN's exclusive interview with the president » . Susannah Sirkin, deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights, on Sunday praised Obama ""for ordering his national security team to collect all the facts in the Dasht-e-Leili massacre and apparent U.S. cover-up."" ""U.S. military and intelligence personnel were operating jointly and accepted the surrender of the prisoners jointly with General Dostum's forces in northern Afghanistan,"" Sirkin said earlier in the week. ""The Obama administration has a legal obligation to determine what U.S. officials knew, where U.S. personnel were, what involvement they had, and the actions of US allies during and after the massacre. These questions, nearly eight years later, remain unanswered.""","Allegations: Bush administration resisted inquiry into CIA-backed Afghan warlord .

"DALLAS, Texas (CNN) -- Police in Irving, Texas, captured a convicted burglar Wednesday who escaped from a medical facility last weekend by rappelling off the building using a string of bedsheets, a department spokeswoman said. Saturday night's escape was the third for Joshua Duane Barnes, 21, since June 2008. Joshua Duane Barnes, 21, escaped Saturday night from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Hospital at Galveston. It was Barnes' third escape from authorities since June 2008. Each time, he was caught in four days. He will face felony escape charges, spokeswoman Michelle Lyons said. According to the Criminal Justice Department's inspector general, about 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, police received a call about a suspicious person in a park, Lyons said. The man ran as police approached him, and police chased him. The man, later identified as Barnes, barricaded himself in an abandoned residence before surrendering to police without incident about 10 a.m. Barnes was to be taken to one of the department's Huntsville-area prisons later in the day. When authorities realized Barnes was missing Saturday, they noticed a hole in the wall where a vent had been removed. Barnes also had broken through a thick window. Barnes was serving 35 years in prison for felony convictions including seven burglary charges, two escape charges and an aggravated assault charge in the Texas Panhandle area, according to a department statement. He began serving his sentence in January. He was housed at a prison in Midway, Texas, but authorities said he was taken to the medical facility in Galveston last week after being hurt in a fight. Barnes' two other escapes took place in Potter County in the Texas Panhandle while he was under the control of local authorities. On June 6, 2008, he fled the county courthouse shortly after being asked to take the stand during a probation violation hearing. The second escape was on October 4, 2008, when Barnes fled the county jail recreational yard after hopping onto the corner of a roof and peeling back layers of sheet metal and galvanized fencing. In both cases, he was found four days later, hiding out at motels. CNN's Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","Convicted burglar escaped from Galveston medical facility Saturday .

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: On HLN, online, on iTunes; here, there and everywhere, this is CNN Student News! Thank you for spending part of your Thursday with us. From the CNN Center, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Health Care Address . AZUZ: First up, health care reform reclaims the spotlight as President Obama takes up the issue in a speech to Congress. This debate has been heating up for months, with politicians and citizens weighing in with their opinions. It's an incredibly complicated issue, so we're gonna look at some of the main points right now. Some people think the country's health care system is fine the way it is. Others think it's broken, but what they don't agree on is how to fix it. For example, how much would it cost to reform the system, and where would that money come from? Should there be a government-run health insurance program? And if so, how might that impact private insurance companies? Those are just a few of the questions facing lawmakers. President Obama says he isn't the first president to take on health care, but he hopes to be the last. He's been pushing for reform since he took office, and he believes the time for action is now. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The time for bickering is over. The time for games has passed. Now is the season for action. Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do. Now is the time to deliver on health care. Health Care Response . AZUZ: After the president wrapped up his address to Congress, the Republican Party offered a response from U.S. Representative Charles Boustany. The Louisiana representative, who has more than 20 years of experience as a surgeon, says he agrees with parts of President Obama's plan. But he thinks it also presents several problems. Last night, he outlined some alternative ideas about how to improve the health care system and how to lower its costs. REP. CHARLES BOUSTANY JR, (R) LOUISIANA: We need to establish tough liability reform standards, encourage speedy resolution of claims, and deter junk lawsuits that drive up the cost of care. Real reform must do this. Let's also talk about letting families and businesses buy insurance across state lines. I and many other Republicans believe that that will provide real choice and competition to lower the cost of health insurance. Shoutout . GEORGE RAMSAY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Stephen Breyer, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas are all members of what governmental body? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Congress, B) The U.S. Supreme Court, C) President Obama's Cabinet or D) The Federal Reserve? You've got three seconds -- GO! Along with six other justices, these people compose the U.S. Supreme Court. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Campaign Finance . AZUZ: It's their job to interpret our country's laws, and one case the justices are looking at right now could have a major impact on elections, including the ones coming up next year! It's all about how much money corporations can give to candidates. Right now, there's a limit on that, but some people argue that violates the Constitution. Elaine Quijano is on the case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FROM CITIZENS UNITED AD FOR ""HILLARY, THE MOVIE"": Who is Hillary Clinton? ELAINE QUIJANO, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: It started small. During last year's presidential primaries, a federal court said campaign finance laws barred this ad for an anti-Hillary Clinton movie by an advocacy group, a non-profit corporation. FROM CITIZENS UNITED AD FOR ""HILLARY, THE MOVIE"": If you thought you knew everything about Hillary Clinton, wait 'til you see the movie. QUIJANO: But now, the Supreme Court could make a monumental change in how money influences politics, deciding, in the name of free speech, whether there should be any limits at all on corporate campaign spending. FRED WERTHEIMER, DEMOCRACY 21, CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM SUPPORTER: Allowing corporations to flood our elections and use campaign expenditures to buy influence would fundamentally undermine our democracy. QUIJANO: Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21 warns overturning a century of precedents would shut average citizens out of the political process. WERTHEIMER: The little guy would have no role here, because the dominant force in our politics, the dominant force in Washington decision-making, would become corporations. QUIJANO: But David Bossee of Citizens United, the group behind the anti-Hillary Clinton movie, argues that anyone pooling resources, including unions, the health industry, advocacy groups like the National Rifle Association, has free speech rights. DAVID BOSSEE, CITIZENS UNITED: I actually went out and looked for this fight, because I don't believe the government should have the right to impede people's entry into the process. And that's what the Federal Election Commission is trying to do here, squelch our first Amendment Rights. QUIJANO: Interestingly, the American Civil Liberties Union agrees. A final ruling is expected in a couple of months, and legal observers say conservatives could hold the key, with enough votes to possibly declare much of current campaign finance law unconstitutional. Elaine Quijano, CNN, the Supreme Court. (END VIDEO CLIP) Flash Flooding . AZUZ: Six months' worth of rain in two days! That is what residents in parts of Turkey are dealing with. This massive downpour triggered flash floods in the country this week, claiming more than 30 lives. In this video - look at this - you can see how the water rushed through a low-lying valley. It flipped and ripped up dozens of cargo trucks. Hundreds of other vehicles were washed out into the sea. The country's prime minister said emergency workers rescued around 1,300 people from the floods. He's already pledged money to get help and relief to the affected regions that need it. I.D. Me . RAMSAY: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a rock band originally from Liverpool, England. I made my first U.S. appearance in 1964. 20 of my songs landed at number 1 on the U.S. charts. And I was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. I'm the Beatles: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr! The Beatles: Rock Band . AZUZ: They were a rock band. Now the Beatles are in Rock Band! A new game featuring the famous Fab Four is out this week. It lets players jam out on dozens of the group's biggest hits. Plus, it gives younger audiences -- you -- a chance to check out some of rock and roll's most famous songs nearly four decades after the band's last gig. That's not the only reason the Beatles are back in the spotlight. All 15 of their albums have been re-mastered and put back on store shelves. Purifying Invention . AZUZ: Meanwhile, a famous inventor wants to do some re-mastering of his own. But we're not talking about digital, we're talking liquid. More than a billion people around the globe don't have access to clean drinking water. Sure, there're water water everywhere, but if it's not clean, it can cause serious consequences. Gary Tuchman looks at one idea designed to quench the problem. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Water: It's the most abundant resource on the planet, yet every year, millions of people die because they don't have access to clean water. So Dean Kamen, the inventor of the Segway, decided to take this problem on with a machine he calls the ""Slingshot."" DEAN KAMEN, INVENTOR: We believe the world needs a slingshot to take care of its goliath of a problem: bad water. TUCHMAN: He says the machine can turn contaminated water like this dirty river water into clean drinking water by boiling, distilling and vaporizing it. KAMEN: In goes the bad, and as you can see, out comes the good. That is pure water. TUCHMAN: The machine is smaller than some other water purifying systems, making it more portable. KAMEN: It's ideally suited to go to places in the developing world. TUCHMAN: Kamen says it requires very little electricity and maintenance to function. But until he finds partners and distributors to keep costs down, Slingshots won't be available to the people who need them most. KAMEN: We've got to find better strategies to deal with this incredibly unique and valuable resource called water, that we've all come to take for granted, but we'll not be able to do that in the future. TUCHMAN: Gary Tuchman, CNN. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we leave you today, we've got a story about something that's pretty darn fast. Usian Bolt may be the quickest person on the planet, but he's got nothing on Sarah. The cheetah charged into the record books yesterday as the world's fastest land mammal. She made the 100-meter dash in 6.16 seconds. Then she went out and shaved some more time off in her second attempt. Now for reference, sprinter Usain Bolt did it in 9.58 seconds. So, cheetah wins. Think you could outrun her? You're welcome to give it a shot. Goodbye . AZUZ: But you've got to make sure that she doesn't break any rules. After all, she's a cheetah. Okay, we know a lot of you probably saw that coming, but you just can't miss the opportunity to make a cheetah pun. It's where we cross the finish line for today, but we'll be back tomorrow to close out the week. We look forward to seeing you then.

"(CNN) -- Giant jellyfish descend on the Sea of Japan, causing untold devastation to coastal villages and leaving a trail of destruction and human misery behind. A diver attaches a sensor to a Nomura's jellyfish off the coast of northern Japan in October 2005. Sounds like a great sci-fi flick. But it's not. It's real and a nightmare for Japanese fishermen. The massive sea creatures, called Nomura's jellyfish, can grow 6 feet (1.83 meters) in diameter and weigh more than 450 pounds (204 kilos). Scientists think they originate in the Yellow Sea and in Chinese waters. For the third year since 2005, ocean currents are transporting them into the Sea of Japan. Monty Graham, a marine biologist at Alabama's Dauphin Island Sea Lab, said the jellyfish grow to an enormous size as they are transported by ocean currents. He said they stay together in packs and as they drift northward, they get caught in fishermen's nets. The giant jellyfish are one of about 200 species of coastal jellyfish or large jellyfish that exist around the world. But Nomura's stands out because of its enormous size. ""The sheer size of them, individually, makes them fairly spectacular,"" Graham said. Spectacular, perhaps, to scientists, but perilous to villagers along the Japanese coast who have seen the destructive habits of these colossal creatures in the past. They had giant-jellyfish invasions in 2005 and 2007, and because they've recently been spotted in the Sea of Japan, they're bracing for another, potentially harmful wave this summer. The jellyfish destroy fishermen's nets, getting trapped in them, tearing holes and ruining catches. Fishermen often use expensive mazelike nets that stretch for hundreds of kilometers. When swarms of giant jellyfish tear them, the result is devastating. ""Communities of fishermen and these fishing villages own these nets,"" Graham said. ""When these nets get wiped out, it actually has this economic devastation for an entire community."" The good news is that previous attacks have prompted Japan to put in place a warning system for fishermen. While they still risk losing a big catch, they can, at least, save their pricey nets from the invasion of the giant jellyfish. It's not clear why waves of Nomura's jellyfish have made it to the Sea of Japan in recent years. Some have speculated that overfishing, pollution or rising ocean temperatures may have depleted the kinds of fish that prey on Nomura's jellyfish in the polyp stage. However, no one is certain, Graham said.","Nomura's jellyfish seen in Sea of Japan for third year since 2005 .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish judge has indicted three suspected former Nazi concentration camp guards Thursday on charges of genocide and ordered their arrests. Visitors mark 60th anniversary of liberation Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 2005. Two of the suspects, Johann Leprich and Anton Tittjung, each 84, are thought to live in the United States, while the third, Josias Kumpf, also 84, is believed to live in Austria, according to a copy of the court order viewed by CNN. They are accused of serving in the Nazi SS. Leprich and Tittjung were armed guards at the Mauthausen concentration camp and Gross Raming subcamp, while Kumpf served at the Sachsenhausen camp, the court order said. In addition to Jews and other types of prisoners, the Spanish judge said there more than 7,000 Spaniards held prisoner at Mauthausen, of whom 4,300 died. Some Spaniards arrived at the Sachsenhausen camp, in convoys from France, the document said. The order, including international arrest warrants, was issued by Judge Ismael Moreno of Spain's National Court, which investigates genocide and crimes against humanity involving Spaniards. The 18-page document cited prior judicial investigative work from other countries regarding the backgrounds of the three alleged ex-Nazi guards and their suspected roles in the notorious Nazi death camps during World War II.","Spanish judge indicts three suspected former Nazi concentration camp guards .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry has identified the suicide bomber who attempted to assassinate the country's assistant interior minister last Thursday and released details of a phone conversation between the two men prior to the attack. A Saudi man reads a newspaper featuring a front-page story on Thursday's attack. The disclosures reported by the country's official news agency were highly unusual. The agency, SPA, reported the attacker, Abdullah Hassan Talea' Asiri, a wanted Saudi militant who had been hiding in Yemen, got in touch with Saudi authorities telling them he wanted to turn himself in to Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Naif, the assistant minister of Interior for Security Affairs. After arriving back in Saudi Arabia, Asiri spoke by phone to Mohammed, who agreed to see him during a Ramadan reception at his home in the city of Jeddah. According to a transcript provided by SPA, during the phone call the men exchanged greetings and discussed the importance of the holy month of Ramadan. Mohammed is quoted as telling Asiri that ""one should be careful; evil people would like to exploit all of you. Now only you to fear Allah Almighty and come home."" Later in the conversation, Asiri asked if a special plane could be dispatched to take him to meet with Mohammed. Asiri, escorted by security, was transported to Jeddah, where he met with the prince at his palace. During the meeting, Asiri explained to Mohammed that other Saudi militants in Yemen also wished to surrender but sought reassurances from the prince. According to SPA, a call was then placed to one of the militants in Yemen. While the prince was on the phone, Asiri blew himself up, SPA reported. Mohammed, who is also the son of the country's Interior Minister, was lightly injured in the attack. Saudi King Abdullah was shown visiting the prince in the hospital after the attack on Saudi TV. The king asked the prince why the militant was allowed to get so close him without being inspected properly and searched thoroughly. Prince Mohammed answered the king by telling him it had been a mistake. SPA adds that ""the concerned security authorities opened an investigation into the incident. However, the criminal laboratory and a forensic report have reached conclusions that, for security considerations, will not be announced at this time."" Asiri's name was on a list of 85 most wanted suspects released by Saudi Arabia in February. At the time the list was released, Saudi Arabia asked Interpol for its help in apprehending dozens of the wanted Saudis on the list who were suspected of plotting attacks against Saudi Arabia from abroad. The announcement was significant because it is rare for the kingdom to announce that some of its most wanted terrorists are on the loose. It is also unusual for Saudi Arabia to ask for help in finding them. Some of the suspects on the most wanted list had been released from Guantanamo Bay, returned to Saudi Arabia, and had then gone through a Jihadi reeducation program run by the Interior Ministry, before fleeing to Yemen and taking up terrorist activity once more. Saudi Arabia has been battling terrorism since 2003, when al Qaeda launched a series of attacks inside the Kingdom. In the security crackdown that followed, Asiri, like many other wanted Saudi militants, fled to Yemen. Earlier this year, Saudi al Qaeda and Yemeni al Qaeda merged to form ""Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula."" Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates out of Yemen, claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack against Mohammed. In August, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry announced that over the past year, 44 al Qaeda suspects across the country had been arrested. While the Interior Ministry is calling the attempted assassination an ""action of treachery and treason"", SPA reports that the Ministry will not change its ""open-door policy"" of granting amnesty to militants wishing to surrender - in particular, ""those citizens residing outside the country"" who wish to ""take advantage of the state-sponsored program of advice and care.""","Wanted Saudi militant Abdullah Hassan Talea' Asiri had been hiding in Yemen .

"(CNN)  -- Jordan Belfi has a great job: He plays Adam Davies on the HBO show ""Entourage,"" a comedy series that takes a look at the life of a young actor, Vincent Chase, and the old friends who surround him in Hollywood. Jordan Belfi arrives at the premiere of ""Entourage"" season six in Los Angeles, California. Davies is one of the few characters on the show who has the ability to shake one of the central figures: the unshakeable agent Ari Gold. Belfi has been around since the early days of ""Entourage"" and remembers the humble beginnings of his character's career as an agent under Gold's direction. Since that first season, Davies has risen to become Ari's chief rival on the show. Belfi believes conveying the tension between him and Ari is easy, based on the great material he's given. ""It's a testament to the writing by Doug Ellin, the creator of the show. It's just on the page,"" Belfi said. ""When you get setups and writing and dialogue and scenes that good, it makes your job that much easier."" CNN talked to Belfi, who's also in the movie ""Surrogates"" (opening Friday), about his experiences on the show and his inspiration for the role. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN:  A lot of fans really missed that rivalry between you and Ari Gold. Talk a little about how you and Jeremy Piven kind of prepare for that and try to make that real on screen. Belfi: Adam Davies has become ... one of the few characters on the show that really knows how to get under Ari's skin and push his buttons. Ari is an entertaining character, and it's fun to watch him go after things, but people really enjoy kind of when Ari's off balance. That interplay, that back and forth, particularly the sort of thing that's happening now [on the show], the constantly one-upping each other, is just really fun to watch. It's entertaining. And I get that response from a lot of the fans of the show. They love Adam Davies for that reason because he just knows how to do it. Jeremy ... [is] an actor with so much power and force and impact that you're sort of forced to up your game. You're really present in the moment. And when you're there and you're really going back and forth, that's when the sparks really fly. CNN: Talk little bit about the inspiration you draw from to play Adam Davies. Belfi: I started way back on season one in the beginning of the show. And back then, Adam Davies was still in his cubicle. So a lot of the inspiration came from meetings I had when I was starting out -- you know, behavior I experienced from agents and other industry people when I was starting out. I was in a not-too-dissimilar position. ... And I think that's what people really respond to. There's an absolute foundation of truth -- almost scary truth -- to the things Adam says, the things Ari does, all that kind of stuff. And it's why it's such a visceral experience for people in the industry and fun for people that happen not to be in the industry. CNN: What are your thoughts on Adam Davies as a person? Belfi: What gives Ari a little bit of his soul, his heart, is that we have all these scenes with his wife and his family, and you really get to see him as a dad. ... [But] we haven't gotten to see any of the personal life of Adam Davies. So I don't know if there's anything yet to kind of balance out those ruthless qualities he has. But I think he's the kind of agent that I'd certainly like to have if you're that actor trying to go after that job. You want that agent who's going to beg, borrow and steal to help prove that you're the guy. So in that respect, it seems like he's someone you'd want on your side. And the thing is, I think that's what made the rivalry between him and Ari so great. You know when he was coming up, he probably did a lot of the same things [as Ari] and ran over people in similar kinds of ways. They're really kind of the same in a lot of ways. So you're either best friends or mortal enemies when you share that much in common with somebody. CNN: Exempting Davies, who's your favorite character on the show and why? Belfi: Ah! Impossible question! I have to exempt Adam Davies from the answer? ... If I absolutely, gun-to-my-head have to choose, there's a quality about [Chase's brother] Drama that I've always loved. And it was maybe more prominent in the first couple of seasons than it is now because it's evolved slightly. The quality that I always found the most entertaining, is that Drama was always this mix of desperation and simultaneous pride. And that's really funny. You know at the beginning he was just scratching, begging for something, some chunk of the game or to get back in the game. But he simultaneously kind of knows it all. And that mix is a great comedic mix, comedic recipe. It was both funny and heartbreaking.   CNN: Of course, our diehard ""Entourage"" fans would love to get some scoop on the coming story lines. You've gotta give us something. Belfi: A little something? Well, I don't think I'd be giving away too much to say that Adam might get Lloyd. In terms of the story line, there's some stuff that I'm told with Drama and his going after this role on ""Melrose Place"" and the screen test for that role and the ups and downs of that. And also, some big things happen between Eric and Sloane. But in terms of the really exciting stuff between Adam Davies and Ari, I guess I'll say this: At the end of season two, when Ari is trying to form his coup, to break up the agency, and Adam is the one who rats him out and gets him fired and humiliated and causes that whole thing ... In the amazing way that Doug has constructed it, all that stuff from the end of season two comes full circle. There's this one thing that happens that will really stand out and that people will talk about. So some fun, exciting stuff to look forward to.","Jordan Belfi plays acting agent Adam Davies on the HBO show ""Entourage""

"(CNN) -- The name is already taken, but ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" might be a fitting title for a new interactive view of the Milky Way unveiled this week by the European Southern Observatory. Hundreds of photos taken with a regular digital camera, along with computer crunching, formed this panorama. The 800-million-pixel panorama shows an edge-on view of the plane of our galaxy, complete with points of interests such as the 12-billion-year-old, star-packed globular cluster Omega Centauri and the beautiful, reddish Rosette Nebula. Want to stay closer to home? The panorama also points out familiar landmarks such as Jupiter, noting it's the third-brightest object in our night sky after the moon and Venus. For a bit of a head-rush, you can choose to zoom in and click on ""Tour Destinations,"" which will take you on a trip from one end of the galaxy to another, stopping at your selected point of interest. Users can explore the image in magnificent detail, uncovering millions of individual stars forming a dustlike haze, or superimpose a map of the different constellations in the sky. The beautiful panorama is the first to be released as part of the GigaGalaxy Zoom project, which seeks to ""link the sky we can all see with the deep, 'hidden' cosmos that astronomers study on a daily basis,"" according to ESO. The image is composed of almost 1,200 photos, which were taken by French astrophotographer Serge Brunier with a regular digital camera from ESO observatories at La Silla and Paranal in Chile and from one of the Canary Islands. ""I wanted to show a sky that everyone can relate to, with its constellations, its thousands of stars, with names familiar since childhood,"" Brunier said. The images were then crunched into the single panorama using special software, an effort that took about 340 computing hours to finish, according to the ESO. You can chart your own trip across the Milky Way at GigaGalaxyZoom.org. The next GigaGalaxy Zoom image will be released Monday.","The 800-million-pixel panorama shows an edge-on view of the plane of our galaxy .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, in a rare interview Thursday, depicted himself as an African hero battling imperialism and foreign attempts to oust him rather than the widespread perception of a dictator clinging to power at the expense of the welfare of his people and country. Robert Mugabe says sanctions against his country are ""unjustifiable."" The 85-year-old Mugabe, the only leader of Zimbabwe since it became independent from Britain in 1980, rejected repeated assertions by CNN's Christiane Amanpour that his policies have driven the nation once known as Africa's breadbasket to virtual economic collapse. Instead, Mugabe accused Britain and the United States of seeking to oust him by imposing economic sanctions, the effects of which he said were worsened by years of drought. He denied that his country is in economic shambles, saying it grew enough food last year to feed all its people, and defended policies that have driven white farmers off their land as properly restoring that land to indigenous Africans. ""The land reform is the best thing (that) could have ever have happened to an African country,"" said Mugabe, a former revolutionary leader who came to power when white-ruled Rhodesia became black-ruled Zimbabwe. ""It has to do with national sovereignty.""  Watch Mugabe on his controversial land reform program » . It was Mugabe's first interview with a Western television network in several years, and he appeared to get frustrated with some of Amanpour's direct questioning, repeatedly denying widely accepted evidence and reports on his nation's woes. Mugabe denied that his ZANU-PF party lost elections in 2008 that forced him to accept a power-sharing agreement with his chief rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, who now is prime minister. Violence surrounding the disputed election, much of it against opposition supporters, further damaged Zimbabwe's standing, but Mugabe rejected any blame on Thursday. ""You don't leave power when imperialists dictate that you leave,"" he insisted. ""There is regime change. Haven't you heard of (the) regime change program by Britain and the United States that is aimed at getting not just Robert Mugabe out of power but get Robert Mugabe and his party out of power?"" He also waved off Amanpour's assertion that the power-sharing arrangement is not working, and that opposition political figures are continuing to get harassed and arrested.  Watch Mugabe talk about power-sharing » . Asked about Roy Bennett, a white opposition figure who has yet to be sworn in as agriculture minister a year after formation of the power-sharing government, Mugabe stammered before saying Bennett faces charges of ""organizing arms of war"" against Zimbabwe. He added that he's heard the prosecution lacks evidence in the case, but said he won't agree to swearing in Bennett until after any charges are dropped. Mugabe also denied any responsibility for harm to the nation from his economic policies, instead blaming what he called ""unjustified"" and ""illegal"" sanctions that he said were intended to bring regime change. ""The sanctions must be lifted. We should have no interference from outside,"" Mugabe said. ""The continued imperialist interference in our affairs is affecting our country adversely."" When Amanpour challenged him by saying most of the sanctions were directed at individuals, rather than economic entities, Mugabe said she was wrong. ""The U.S. sanctions are real sanctions, economic sanctions. Have you looked at them?"" he said. ""It's because of sanctions, mainly."" Amanpour tried to push the point, saying outside observers blamed his policies and not sanctions. ""Not everybody says so,"" Mugabe cut her off. ""It's not true."" He also rejected criticism from South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner for his role in the anti-apartheid struggle, who has accused Mugabe of turning Zimbabwe into a ""basket case"" and repressing his own people. ""It's not a basket case at all,"" Mugabe said. He later called Tutu's comments ""devilish talk"" and added: ""He doesn't know what he's talking about, the little man."" On the takeover of white-owned farms -- a policy blamed for undermining the agriculture sector -- Mugabe displayed the African nationalist fervor of his revolutionary days. ""Zimbabwe belongs to the Zimbabweans, pure and simple,"" he said, then adding that white Zimbabweans -- even those born in the country with legal ownership of their land -- have a debt to pay. ""They occupied the land illegally. They seized the land from our people,"" Mugabe said. When Amanpour pressed him on white farmers being forced off their land, he shot back, ""Not just off their land. Our land."" ""They are British settlers,"" he said, later calling them ""citizens by colonization, seizing land from original people, indigenous people of the country."" Asked if would run again in elections likely to take place in 2011, Mugabe refused to answer, but denied he feared defeat and again rejected charges of past electoral wrongdoing. ""Elections don't go all that smoothly all the time in many countries,"" he said, tossing a jab at the United States. ""Look what happens elsewhere. They didn't go smoothly here, look at what happened during the first term of Bush.""","Mugabe rejects criticism that he has turned Zimbabwe into a ""basket case""

"(CNN) -- Jaycee Dugard will testify against the couple that allegedly held her captive in an elaborate compound hidden in their backyard for 18 years if there is a trial, a lawyer for her family said at a news conference Thursday. This photo of Jaycee Dugard was taken at the 1991 Rose Bowl parade. She was abducted later that year. Attorney McGregor Scott admitted it has been a difficult transition for Dugard and her two children -- who police say were fathered by her captor -- given her captivity spanned more than half her life and was the only world she knew for so long. ""But there is no question that she knows that terrible and wrong things were done to her and that those people must be held accountable,"" Scott  said. Scott said he had no idea when a trial would be set for Phillip and Nancy Garrido, who have both pleaded not guilty to charges relating to Dugard's alleged kidnapping and subsequent abuse. He acknowledged Dugard would have to relive the ""trauma"" in court by sharing the ""very, very sordid tale."" Scott also said that because of Phillip Garrido's previous criminal history, which includes a kidnapping and rape charge for which he was registered as a sex offender, Garrido would automatically receive a sentence of 25 years to life if he were found guilty on only one felony charge. But Scott said the family is trying not to focus on any of that  and instead work on building a new life together. He said he had met with Dugard and her family twice for a couple of hours and was happy to see ""how well they had been doing."" ""Even more encouraging was the second time I met with them, I saw progress,"" he said. ""I'm just very pleasantly surprised watching the dynamics, and I think it's a very positive thing going forward."" Scott said Dugard's daughters, who police said never went to school or a doctor, were receiving tutoring. Dugard has been participating and observing. ""This is a woman whose [own] formal education ended in the fifth grade,"" he said. ""She has a brain that she wants to develop, so it's a very positive thing."" The family received medical attention and counseling beginning the day Dugard and her children were discovered, Scott said. He also said they had received donations of more than $100,000 from the public, which would help the girls as they get older. He praised law enforcement and family members for helping protect Dugard and her children after her discovery. ""[They are] very guarded in allowing the girls access to TV news, Internet, etc.,"" he said. ""Because they're being a mother, a grandmother, protecting the girls from too much information too early."" He said he knows there is a curiosity about where the family is, but pleaded that the public and the media give the family time to heal. More than anything, Scott said, Dugard's family is working to make life as normal as possible and allow them to make up for lost time. ""To watch the interaction between Jaycee and her mother ... after 18 years is remarkable,"" Scott said.  ""The emotions there, I think they're still wrestling with all of that but I think they're making great progress.""","Lawyer: Jaycee Dugard ""knows that terrible and wrong things were done to her""

The Beastie Boys' Adam Yauch will be treated for a cancerous tumor in a salivary gland. ""The good news is that they did scans of my whole body and it's only localized in this one area and it's not in a place that affects my voice,"" Yauch says. ""So, that's nice. That's convenient."" The cancer is in his left parotid gland and ""also in a lymph node right in that area,"" he says. He will probably have surgery next week and radiation treatments afterward, he says. With band mate Adam ""Ad-Rock"" Horovitz sitting next to him, Yauch tells fans how he found out he had cancer. ""About two months ago, I started feeling this little lump in my throat, like you would feel if you have swollen glands or something like that, like you'd feel if you have a cold, so I didn't really think it was anything,"" he says.

"(InStyle) -- Drew Barrymore keeps evolving -- from star to producer, and now director. Drew Barrymore sat down with InStyle for its October issue, on newsstands Thursday. The 34-year-old actress earned critic's attention with her uncanny portrayal of ""Little Edie"" Beale in HBO's ""Grey Gardens,"" and her directorial debut, ""Whip It,"" has been hailed as a success well before it rolls into theaters October 2. But, at her core, she's still the irresistible free spirit we all know and love, as she revealed in the October issue of InStyle. On being a celebrity ... Barrymore said that while she loves her life, there are still moments she battles with being a celebrity. ""Some days I want nothing more than a brilliant mask so I could look like someone else and go wander the streets and be free,"" she said. ""I'm very peeved that Halloween only comes once a year."" On exercise... When it comes to transforming her body for a role, as she did for ""Grey Gardens,"" the sunny actress is nothing but dedicated. But in everyday life, Barrymore aims for balance and body acceptance. ""I don't have the time or discipline or interest in having a perfect-10 body. I work out, I eat right, but I'll always be a little bit of Jell-O on a pole."" On her relationship with her mom ... Barrymore admitted her relationship with her mom is a topic she doesn't readily discuss, but the central love story between a girl and her mom in ""Whip It"" caused Barrymore to reflect on her relationship.""I am OK with my dad, but my mom and I have yet to work it all out,"" she said, adding that she doesn't talk about it because ""how do you talk about something you're confused about?"" On girl power ... From ""Charlie's Angels"" to her new all-girl roller derby flick, it's no secret that Barrymore champions female friendships. ""I like teams -- I like buddies. I don't understand women who are competitive, apart from positive forums like athletics. One person is a powerful thing, but a tribe is unstoppable."" On her first fashion faux pas ... Barrymore is known for her ever-evolving, ever-eccentric style, but said anything she donned during the ""E.T."" era can be labeled as a fashion faux pas. Or can it?  ""Velour and taffeta, together? Oh, no, no, no. Now I think it's brilliant."" On her first broken heart... Barrymore recently broke up with The Strokes' drummer Fabrizio Moretti, and called the five-year relationship one of the most important in her life. But when it comes to her first broke heart, Barrymore said it was her ""first big boyfriend, Jamie Walters.""

"(CNN) -- Actress Mackenzie Phillips has said that she believes she had a ""genetic predisposition"" to the life of sex, drugs and rock and roll that have come to define her. Mackenzie Phillips tells CNN's ""Larry King Live"" that her father raped her in 1979. In a 1999 interview on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on ""Why Some Childhood Stars Crash and Burn,"" the former ""One Day at a Time"" star said she didn't blame Hollywood for the years of drug and addiction she had endured. ""I think that for a lot of us, alcoholism and addiction is the root of the problem, not the fact that we were child stars,"" she said at the time. ""Certainly, it lent to the problem, but it wasn't the root of the problem."" By the time she did the interview, her well-publicized addiction to cocaine, drug arrests and stints in rehab had overshadowed an acting career once full of promise. Then, on Wednesday, the 49-year-old actress revealed on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" that she engaged in an incestuous relationship with her father, legendary musician John Phillips, for nearly 10 years. In her tell-all memoir, ""High on Arrival"" -- named after a song her father dedicated to her -- she claims the relationship began in 1979. She claims her father forced himself on her while they were under the influence of drugs on the night before she was to marry Jeff Sessler, a member of the Rolling Stones' entourage. She ended the relationship a decade later, when she became pregnant and realized she did not know who had fathered her child -- her husband or her own father -- and terminated the pregnancy, the actress told CNN's ""Larry King Live.""  Watch Phillips discuss her alleged incestuous relationship with her father » . But before the incest claims -- and subsequent denials from relatives -- Mackenzie Phillips was better known as a child actor full of promise who fell from grace under the toxic guidance of her drug-addicted father. Born Laura Mackenzie Phillips in 1959 to John Phillips and Baltimore socialite Susan Adams, Phillips told People magazine in 1980 that she alternated between two wildly different worlds after her parents divorced when she was three years old. ""My mother concentrated on bringing me up a proper lady,"" Mackenzie Phillips told the magazine. ""And then on weekends at my dad's place, I would find Mick Jagger and Donovan and the Beatles hanging out. I remember crawling all over Paul McCartney."" Her father taught her to roll a joint when she was 10, she tried cocaine for the first time when she was 11 and lost her virginity at age 12, she told Meredith Vieira of NBC's""Today"" show. When she was 12, a talent scout for Francis Ford Coppola spotted her playing in a band with classmates on amateur night at the Troubadour, according to People.com. She eventually landed a memorable role in the 1973 hit coming-of-age flick, ""American Graffiti."" After filming, her mother sent her to a Swiss boarding school, but the rebellious teen didn't last long in exile. She returned to her father's home in Los Angeles under the supervision of her father's sister, Rosemary Throckmorton. When her father and stepmother left for New York in 1974 and never returned, Mackenzie, her brother Jeffrey, moved in with their aunt in ""a little house behind the Hollywood Bowl which we shared with 12 cats,"" according to People.com. Despite her relocations, Phillips' career continued to advance. At 15, she appeared in her second movie, ""Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins,"" with Alan Arkin. In 1975, she was offered the role of Julie Cooper on CBS' hit sitcom, ""One Day at a Time,"" according to IMDB.com. ""By the time I turned 18, I moved into a little chalet of my own and felt very grown-up,"" Mackenzie told People in an interview in 1980. As her star grew, so did her appetite for drugs, particularly cocaine. A few years later, just after she turned 18, Phillips was arrested when she was found collapsed on quaaludes on a street in Los Angeles. Phillips said on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" that her father's response was, ""Congratulations! Now you're a real Phillips. Now you know that even though they caught you, the rules don't apply."" Her weight loss and erratic behavior disrupted the show's filming and became a source of distress to her co-stars, Bonnie Franklin and Valerie Bertinelli, according to People.com. According to Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh's ""The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows,"" Phillips missed the 1980-81 season while in rehab for addiction issues. When she went to seek treatment at Fair Oaks, a psychiatric hospital in Summit, New Jersey, in December 1980, she joined her father and stepmother, who entered the hospital after being charged with conspiracy to distribute narcotics, according to People.com. She left with a clean bill of health, but soon enough resumed using drugs even as she attempted to rebuild her career as a member of her father's new version of the Mamas & the Papas. In her memoir, she recalls arriving at a hotel room to find two packages -- one containing her father's newly published memoir and another containing an eighth of an ounce of cocaine, according to excerpts of the book published on MSNBC.com. After shooting up, she recalls reaching for the book and looking up her name in the index. ""Under my name was a list of subheadings and page numbers. I scanned down the entries: . Phillips, Laura Mackenzie . acting career of... arrested on drug charges... attempts to clean out... in California... childhood of... drug use by... early childhood of... at finishing school in Switzerland... Jeff Sessler and... marriage to Jeff Sessler... Peter Asher and... rape.... shipboard romance on QE 2... ""There it was, my life to date, with highlights selected, cross-referenced, and alphabetized. I had been organized and reduced to a list of sensational and mostly regrettable and/or humiliating anecdotes. Being indexed, particularly under such dubious headings, gave me a weird feeling that definitely wasn't pride. I felt like I wasn't a real person, just a list of incidents and accidents,"" she writes in the book. Her television career experienced a revival in the 1990s, with guest appearances on hot shows including ""Beverly Hills, 90210,"" ""Melrose Place,"" ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" and ""Chicago Hope,"" her profile on IMDB.com states. From 1999 to 2001, she had a regular role in the Disney series, ""So Weird,"" and several other television guest appearances followed, according to IMDB.com. She appeared to be getting her life back on track, eventually giving birth to a son, Shane. She was arrested in for drug possession in 2008 on her way to an ""One Day at a Time"" reunion. Since then, she says she has been drug-free, and hopes that purging herself of the secret incestuous relationship will help her recover. Yet she insists she does not hate her father for what he did.

"(CNN)  -- Authorities have seized $1 billion worth of marijuana plants and have arrested 82 Mexican nationals with ties to drug cartels in the first week and half of an effort to eradicate marijuana fields from California's Fresno County, the county sheriff's office said Wednesday. The 82 suspects arrested so far have links to Mexican drug cartels. Operation Save Our Sierra began July 13 and involves local, state and federal agencies working together to remove marijuana growing operations, investigate and arrest drug traffickers, and remove infrastructure on public lands in Fresno County, a news release said. ""This is a high-intensity drug trafficking area,"" U.S. Drug Czar Gil Kerlikowske said in a phone interview. ""I think what should be highlighted here is the local authorities' work to reclaim the land from the drug traffickers."" The 82 suspects arrested so far have links to Mexican drug cartels, local authorities said, though they did not release further details. Eastern Fresno County, where the seizures have been made, is mountainous and sparsely populated. Growers exploit the area's streams, rivers and lakes to create elaborate drip lines for their plants. A mature plant can be worth $4,000, said Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims. ""Fresno County is roughly the size of Connecticut, and the drug traffickers target these areas because they know there is not that significant of a law-enforcement presence,"" Mims said. ""The chances of getting caught are slim."" ""The bottom line is our public lands are being destroyed by foreign drug trafficking and heavily armed Mexican cartels,"" George Anderson of the U.S. Department of Justice said Wednesday at a news conference highlighting the seizures. The operation is the largest in Fresno County history and one of the largest in California, Mims said. ""What makes this operation unique is the approach: prevention, enforcement, eradication and reclamation,"" she said. Intelligence gathered for the operation began in February, with community presentations about prevention. The effort is now focused on shutting down the at least 70 marijuana farms identified by local authorities. The operation is expected to continue into November, when colder weather makes marijuana growing more difficult. At least 330,000 marijuana plants have been seized, Mims said. ""This shows what can be accomplished at the local level when agencies work together,"" Kerlikowske said. Kerlikowske, who flew to Fresno County on Wednesday and toured a marijuana farm, said his office is one of the primary sponsors of the operation.","The U.S. drug czar says it is a high-intensity drug trafficking area .

"DALLAS, Texas (CNN)  -- A terrorism suspect accused of plotting the bombing of a skyscraper made his first appearance in federal court Friday. Hosam Maher Husein Smadi said through his lawyer that he understood the charges Friday. Hosam Maher Husein Smadi, a 19-year-old Jordanian, said little during a 20-minute hearing at the Dallas federal courthouse. His lawyer, however, said Smadi understood the gravity of the charge. Judge Irma Ramirez set a probable cause hearing for October 5. Smadi initially drew authorities' scrutiny because of his violent posts on an extremist chat site, court papers indicate. He was arrested Thursday in a sting operation, the FBI said. Federal officials said Smadi, who entered the United States illegally and lived in Texas, tried to set off an explosive attached to a vehicle at the base of the 60-story Fountain Place office tower. Long before authorities arrested Smadi, however, they were following his Internet discussions, according to a court affidavit. ""Smadi was discovered by the FBI within an online group of extremists,"" the affidavit says. ""Among many others in the group who espoused and endorsed violence, Smadi stood out based on his vehement intention to actually conduct terror attacks in the United States."" Undercover officers then contacted Smadi, posing as members of an al Qaeda sleeper cell. After months of conversations, the agents considered Smadi a legitimate threat. Smadi picked several targets to attack, including the Dallas-Forth Worth airport, before deciding on the skyscraper, which houses Wells Fargo Bank, the affidavit says. It details a conversation that Smadi is said to have had with authorities: . ""I have decided to change the target,"" he said, according to the affidavit. ""God willing, the strike will be certain and strong. It will shake the currently weak economy in the state and the American nation, because this bank is one of the largest banks in the city."" Smadi said many times that he wanted to commit violent jihad and he was a soldier of Osama bin Laden, the affidavit says. Undercover agents tried to get Smadi to ""re-evaluate his interpretation of jihad,"" saying there were nonviolent ways to commit the act. But ""Smadi again communicated his continuing commitment for violent jihad,"" the affidavit says. After casing the bank in July, Smadi told an undercover agent he would target it, according to authorities. Initially, Smadi told the agent he wanted to bomb the bank on September 11 but decided to wait until the Islamic holy month of Ramadan ended on September 20, authorities said. After receiving what he thought was an explosive from an undercover agent, Smadi drove a car with the fake bomb into a parking garage under the skyscraper, authorities said.  Watch how a Jordanian was given fake explosive » . Smadi thought he could detonate the bomb by dialing his cell phone, they said. When he dialed, the number rang a phone in authorities' possession, the affidavit says. Counterterrorism officials arrested Smadi on Thursday before publicly disclosing a similar but unrelated terrorism sting arrest Wednesday in Springfield, Illinois. A federal law enforcement official familiar with the cases said authorities feared that word of the Illinois arrest could tip off the Texas suspect to the sting operation.  Watch what the recent terror arrests mean » . A charge of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction carries a potential sentence of life in prison and a $250,000 fine. In the Illinois case, undercover FBI agents foiled a plot to bomb Springfield's federal building, authorities said. In neither case did authorities find ties to known terrorist groups. Journalist Todd Bensman and CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Sean Callebs and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","NEW: Suspect initially wanted to stage attack on September 11, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez revealed a deeply personal side in an interview Thursday night, saying he loves Jesus Christ and would have liked to play Major League baseball in Yankee Stadium. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez spoke highly of President Obama at the United Nations on Thursday. He also expressed a fondness for American people and culture, saying he likes the movie actor Charles Bronson and the poet Walt Whitman. He loves to sing, he said, though he does not do it well. And Chavez had kind words for the U.S. security detail protecting him during his visit to New York, saying he chatted with them while out walking and that they ""have been very gracious, very efficient and very attentive, very kind."" In an exclusive interview with CNN's Larry King, Chavez spoke at length about a host of issues: relations between Venezuela and the United States and his hopes for improved ties with President Barack Obama; Iran, Israel and those who deny that the Holocaust existed; efforts to overthrow him and have him assassinated; criticism that he is power hungry and trying to silence critics. Chavez, a self-proclaimed socialist, spoke with King a few hours after giving a speech to the U.N. General Assembly, in which he praised Obama but criticized some U.S. policies.   Watch Chavez speak at the U.N. General Assembly » . When asked whether he is misunderstood in the United States, Chavez seemed to turn reflective. ""I'm a man with many defects,"" he said. ""I love. I sing. I dream. I was born in the poor countryside. I was raised in the countryside, planting corn and selling sweets made by my grandmother. My children, my two daughters are with me and I want a better world for my grandchildren, for your grandchildren. ""Now, they demonize me. But that's the start of these world campaigns to try to defend what you cannot defend -- a system that is destroying the world. ... I'm a Christian. I want the world of justice and equality. This is the only way to achieve peace."" Chavez then talked about his religious upbringing and current faith. ""I was an altar boy,"" he said. ""My mother wanted me to be a priest. I am very Christian and Catholic. ... I'm very faithful. I believe in God, in Jesus Christ. I love Jesus Christ. I am a Christian. ... I cry when I see injustice, children dying of hunger."" His comments were all the more remarkable because Chavez and the Catholic Church have been at odds since he came to power in 1999. The church has been one of his major critics, with Pope Benedict XVI and other church leaders expressing concern over what they see as attempts by Chavez to limit the church's influence. Chavez's efforts to change anti-abortion laws have been at the top of those concerns. Chavez, in turn, has referred to church leadership as a ""tumor."" Speaking of other matters, Chavez said he hopes for improved relations with Obama, but ""we want relations based on respect, relations of peoples where we are respected."" That has not been the case so far, he said. ""Most governments in the United States in a hundred years have not respected the peoples of Latin America,"" Chavez told King. ""They have sponsored coup d'etats, assassinations. It's enough. We want to be brothers and sisters. We want respect and equality."" Chavez particularly criticized former President George W. Bush, whom he accused of orchestrating an assassination attempt on the Venezuelan leader during a short-lived coup in 2002. Chavez regained power within days.  Watch Chavez discuss the alleged assassination attempt » . ""The Bush government toppled me,"" he said. ""They asked for my assassination. They disrespected us. ... I saw my assassins. ... I was a prisoner in Venezuela, being a president. They took me to the seaside. I was debating with those who wanted murder me. They received the order to kill me. However, at this very moment, a group of soldiers refused. They did not kill me, but I saw those who wanted to kill me, and the order came from the White House."" Chavez also expressed concern that the United States, which he calls ""the empire,"" still would like to topple him. As he has numerous times in recent weeks, Chavez criticized U.S. plans to begin operating out of military bases in neighboring Colombia. The United States says it needs a presence in Colombia to fight drug traffickers. Chavez sees a sinister intent. When asked what country he fears would harm him, Chavez replied, ""The empire. The empire. Seven military bases ... in Colombia, that's a serious threat against Venezuela."" Chavez also defended his relationship with Iran but denied having said that Iran would help Venezuela obtain nuclear technology. Iran has embarked on a nuclear program that the United States and other nations think will lead it to develop nuclear weapons before long. ""They have fooled you,"" Chavez said. ""I've never said that Iran is going to help us to have nuclear technology. ... That's a strategy to attack Venezuela and say that we are building an atomic bomb. That's the next accusation. And I'm going to say this now: Please, come on. That's crazy. That's crazy."" Chavez said he does not agree with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's contention that the Holocaust, in which 6 million European Jews were killed during World War II, never existed. ""But there also was another holocaust in South America,"" Chavez said. ""I do not deny the Jewish Holocaust. And I condemn it. But in South America, when the Europeans arrived, there were close to 90 million Indians; 200 years later, we only had four million remaining. That was a holocaust. And the Europeans denied this holocaust."" Israel came under criticism from Chavez, who called it a ""small country with atomic bombs, and very aggressive country. ... They have massacred entire families. It is a war-mongering country."" Turning to the situation in his own country, Chavez denied that he is trying to shut down critical media, such as the independent Globovision TV station. Government officials have levied several charges against the station, saying that it is disseminating false information and trying to foment dissatisfaction against Chavez. The Chavez government has repealed licenses for other independent TV and radio stations, and has threatened to do so against Globovision. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter this week joined human rights groups and others who have expressed concern over what they see as Chavez becoming too authoritarian. Chavez dismissed the criticism. ""Never in Venezuela have we had so much freedom of speech as now,"" he said. Pressed by King about whether he is going to shut down Globovision, Chavez answered, ""I do not know. It depends on them. If they keep on sponsoring coup d'etats, if they keep on calling for my assassination, if they keep on breaching the law even as well, it is not Chavez that's going to close them. I want to apply the law. We need to respect the law. It is the law. It's out of logic, and it's pure logic."" As to Carter, Chavez said, ""Yes, I read that and I regret for him, because I think he's totally confounded and lost. It's a long time since he visited us. I respect him enormously, but I think he is wrong. He's a victim of so much falsehood in the world.""","Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says he loves Jesus Christ, U.S. people, culture .

He told CNN that 640 patients had tested positive for the infection, including 30 with Japanese encephalitis, which is spread by mosquitoes. Acute encephalitis can be spread in various ways, including a bacterial or viral infection; the ingesting of toxic substances; and complications of a disease.

"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on issues affecting communities across the country. County administrator Brenda T. Buck is trying hard to help create eight to 10 sawmill jobs for Jefferson County. FAYETTE, Mississippi (CNN) -- The odds are against Brenda T. Buck, and she knows it. So she counts on what she calls the Sandwich Philosophy: ""Take it one bite at a time."" Buck is the county administrator in Jefferson County, a rural area in southwest Mississippi dotted with small churches, modest homes and markers noting a Civil War skirmish. ""It is a great small town, and everybody knows everybody,"" Buck says. If you look through the statistics, three things jump out: . • The Census Bureau lists the population of Jefferson County as 86 percent African American, the highest percentage of any county in the United States. • It is the fourth-poorest county in the United States, with a median income of $15,037. • The unemployment rate in August was 18.6 percent, the highest of Mississippi's 82 counties. ""It has not always been this way,"" says Angelia Shelvy, a single mother of three who is among the unemployed. ""I think we are forgotten."" Shelvy had a job making $10,000 a year as a teacher's assistant, but she left it to take a job paying twice as much, signing on with a union that provides workers to nuclear power plants. Her parents agreed to care for her children when she had to travel, for months at a time, as far away as Arizona. Shelvy thought it was the right thing to do for her family, but phone calls to home at bedtime proved otherwise. Her 4-year-old, especially, had a rough time adjusting. ""I'm like, 'You have Granny.' He's like, 'No, I don't want Granny; I want you to hold me,' "" Shelvy told us. ""I missed Mother's Day twice; for two years I missed it. ... So I decided that it was more important for me to be here with my children."" Back home now, she has been searching for work since March, looking as far as 90 minutes away from Fayette. ""I did Internet searching, different jobs, hospitals, different schools,"" she said. ""They're not hiring. They either say they are not hiring, or I'm not qualified. I don't have enough years of experience. 'We'll call you later.' 'Get back with us.' And it's been stressful for me."" Buck spends hours a day trying to help, and most of her time with the Board of Supervisors is spent debating economic development ideas. At home, too, she is reminded of the bleak local jobs market. Her husband isn't there. He's working 900 miles away, at the moment, in Indiana. ""He works with a company that has been going into a lot of the car plants"" during refittings and downsizing, Buck said. ""We have four kids. ... He is here basically maybe a total combination of, maybe, two months out of the year."" The county got a modest amount of federal money to buy new police cruisers. But its requests for stimulus money to improve its roads have been ignored, at least to date, and as Buck continues to press those requests, she also is pushing smaller economic development grants. Reliable Mat LLC is her current obsession. The screeching hum of a giant saw greets visitors, and inside the warehouse are dozens of pallets of neatly stacked firewood, waiting to be loaded on 18-wheelers and distributed across the country for the coming winter. On the grounds, there are 10 workers, some running giant logs through the saw, others stacking and wrapping the wood for shipment. On average, the men make about $100 day, and Paul Southerland, the company's general manager, says the noise and activity attracts others who are down on their luck. ""I see a lot of people come by looking for jobs, yeah,"" Southerland says during a tour of the grounds. The company's main product is giant wooden mats used to create flat surfaces to provide access -- on foot and in vehicles -- to oil and gas fields. All of the work has shifted to the firewood production because orders for the mats have dropped dramatically. ""Mississippi is always last to feel the effects of a recession, and most of the time it is the last to pick back up,"" Southerland said. ""It hit us about June. .. It really hit us hard, too."" Still, Southerland expects orders to pick up early next year. He hopes to expand the business by then if the county secures an economic development grant to help him buy a bigger sawmill. ""If we had that sawmill, we would be able to add eight or 10 more folks,"" Southerland said. Eight or 10 more jobs might not seem like much in many places. But Jefferson County's population is just shy of 9,000, and when nearly one in five are unemployed, Buck invokes her Sandwich Philosophy. ""My short term goal is to get that grant, to get those eight people working,"" she says. ""My philosophy, when I walk through the doors in the morning, just like a sandwich: take one bite at a time."" She also sees a bigger gain than just eight or 10 jobs.

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Three independent United Nations human rights experts have accused Iran of torturing confessions from detainees charged with fomenting political unrest, the international organization said Thursday. Iranian opposition suspects cover their faces at a Revolutionary Court hearing in Tehran last week. ""No judicial system can consider as valid a confession obtained as a result of harsh interrogations or under torture,"" said Manfred Nowak, who is the U.N. special rapporteur on torture. The treatment of detainees at Iran's prisons has increasingly become a divisive issue within Iran's Islamic leadership, as reformists continue to accuse the hardline government of allowing abuse and torture in attempts to coerce false confessions. Iranian officials have denied the allegations. ""These confessions for alleged crimes such as threats against national security and treason must not, under any circumstances, be admitted as evidence by the Revolutionary Court,"" said El Hadji Malick Sow, vice chairman of the U.N.'s working group on arbitrary detention. The United Nations, in a news release, said the statements also reflect the position of Margaret Sekaggya, special U.N. rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders. Iran is conducting a mass trial of about 100 Iranian defendants in its Revolutionary Court. Reformist politicians, lawyers and journalists are among those accused of protesting in an attempt to overturn government leadership. Among the defendants are Seyyed Mohammad Abtahi, a former Iranian vice president; Maziar Bahari, an Iranian-Canadian reporter for Newsweek magazine; and Kian Tajbakhsh, an Iranian-American scholar. Street protests and a brutal government crackdown followed the June 12 presidential election, leading to the arrests of more than 1,000 people. The official death toll from the post-election unrest is 30, although opposition leaders have reportedly said it's more than twice that figure. On Wednesday, Iran's influential parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, dismissed allegations by Iran's opposition that post-election detainees were raped while in custody, according to state-run media. Larijani said that a special panel of Iran's parliament, or Majlis, conducted a ""precise and comprehensive inquiry"" into the treatment at Tehran's Evin and Kahrizak prisons, and found ""no cases of rape or sexual abuse,"" government-funded Press TV reported. A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry also denied that prisoners had been tortured. ""What kind of talk is this? There was never any pressure used against these people,"" Hassan Qashqavi said Monday, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. They were responding to accusations made by opposition candidate Mehdi Karrubi who, along with opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi, ran against hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June 12 election. Iran's election authority declared Ahmadinejad the overwhelming winner of the race, sparking hundreds of thousands of Iranians to take to the streets in protest. Iranian opposition figures such as Karrubi have compared the treatment of the detainees to political prisoners abused under the ""oppressing regime"" of the Shah of Iran, who was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution in 1979. In an open letter to former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani posted Saturday on his party's Web site, Karrubi says an ""impartial committee"" is needed to ""investigate these tragedies with transparency until they are resolved."" He said he is willing to lead the investigation in a ""truthful, unbiased fashion."" ""Some of the former detainees have told of such brutal and violent, repeated rapes of the young women [in detention] that have caused irreparable damage to their reproductive systems,"" Karrubi says in the letter. ""Others have raped our detained young men with such brutality that they have been afflicted by depression and are no longer speaking with anyone and refuse to leave the dark corners of their houses."" Larijani on Wednesday challenged Karrubi to ""present evidence of such outrages"" for the Majlis to investigate, according to Press TV. Iranian media has reported that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, has ordered one prison, Kahrizak, shut down amid reports it did not measure up to the required standards. Kahrizak's chief was fired and arrested over allegations of detainee mistreatment, according to local reports Saturday.","3 U.N. human rights experts say government tortured detained protesters .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- A report from an Israeli advocacy group based on what it says is the testimony of several unnamed Israeli soldiers accuses the Israeli military of intentionally putting Palestinian civilians at risk during its recent operation in Gaza. Palestinian Majid Abed Raboh, left, shows Wednesday how he says Israeli soldiers used him as a human shield. The report, released Wednesday from a group called ""Breaking the Silence"" -- which includes former Israeli soldiers -- has been dismissed by the Israeli military as slanderous. In the 110-page report, the group said some of the 26 soldiers interviewed said they used Palestinians as human shields during the military's more than two-week long ground operation in Gaza earlier this year. ""In some cases a civilian would be forced to walk in front of soldier while the soldier places his gun barrel on the civilian's shoulder,"" the report states. Other soldiers talk about destroying buildings even though the structures posed no direct threat. They also said that white phosphorus was used in densely populated areas and describe the rules of engagement as ""permissive."" Phosphorus shells can be used to create a smokescreen for troops. In creating the diversion, the element ignites when exposed to oxygen and can cause severe burns. International law calls on militaries to limit the use white phosphorus in civilian areas. Other organizations, including the United Nations' Human Rights Council, Amnesty International and the U.S.-based Physicians for Human Rights, have criticized the Israeli military's conduct in Gaza. Israel has questioned the legitimacy of those claims, as well. The stories presented by Breaking the Silence are anonymous accounts which CNN cannot independently verify. The group said that the soldiers were not willing to speak with the media. In response to the report's allegations, the Israeli military said it complied with international law on all fronts. The advocacy group said many of the soldiers interviewed in its report are still serving and fear repercussions if they reveal their identity, and they did not take their complaints up the chain of command. The Israeli military has rejected the report, saying the anonymous nature of the testimonies means they lack credibility. ""There are no factual details, no places, no names of incidents in specific houses on a specific date,"" military spokesman Lt. Col. Avital Liebovitch said. ""I would be more than happy to be provided with these details and I will be able to investigate them."" The Israeli military conducted its own investigation into soldiers' actions during Operation Cast Lead, its 22-day military offensive in January against the militant group Hamas in an effort to end ongoing rocket attacks. It found that Israeli forces ""operated in accordance with international law"" although there were a few incidents in which ""intelligence or operational errors"" occurred. Fighting left more than 1,400 Palestinians dead according to officials in Gaza, while Israel put that death toll closer to 1,100, saying more than 70 percent of those killed were Hamas militants. Thirteen Israelis were killed during the operation, including three civilians. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak, responding to the report which was widely publicized in Israel, said the criticism was ""misplaced and misdirected."" ""If someone has a criticism, or information or conclusions about IDF (Israel Defense Forces) actions, they should bring them to me, as minister of defense of the state of Israel, and to the Israeli government that instructed the IDF to restore quiet to the communities in the south,"" Barak said. ""The IDF is the most moral army in the world and it operates according to the highest ethical code."" CNN did independently obtain corroborating detail on one anonymous claim in the report. Gaza resident Shafiq Daher told CNN earlier this week that he was used as a human shield by Israeli soldiers during the recent Gaza military operation. His description of his experience closely matched an account given in the Breaking the Silence report. ""He was holding with all his strength like this and with his heavy machine gun on the other shoulder,"" said Daher, who demonstrated how the soldier walked behind him as they approached his neighbors' homes. The Israeli military would not comment on whether Palestinians were used as human shields in Gaza, saying only that there are dozens of ongoing internal investigations into individual soldier conduct. Daher, who lives in Jabaliya outside Gaza City, said he was forced to search his neighbors' homes this way for about a week, under heavy fire. He said he was also given a hammer and told to break through his neighbors' walls. ""I felt like a dead man walking,"" he said. ""I was walking and praying to God and thought this is what death is like.""","Israeli advocacy group bases report on testimony of unnamed Israeli soldiers .

"(CNN)  -- Astounding. Risky. Quitter. And that's what fellow conservatives had to say Sunday about Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and her decision to step down with 18 months left in her term. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin announced Friday that she will step down this month. Democrats left it to Republican and conservative voices to assess what Friday's unexpected announcement by Palin means for her and a possible run for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. For example, Vice President Joe Biden called it a personal decision, offering no analysis of why she did it. By contrast, those on the political right acknowledged that they didn't know what to make of it. Karl Rove, the ""architect"" of George W. Bush's successful presidential campaigns, said the resignation left many of Palin's fellow Republicans ""a little perplexed."" ""It's a risky strategy,"" Rove told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""Astounding,"" was the pronouncement by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and conservative columnist George Will said Palin was declaring herself a quitter. Palin, who was Sen. John McCain's vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election, said she already knew she would not seek a second term and decided against being a lame duck governor for the next 18 months. She also complained that too much time and too many taxpayer dollars were going toward fighting ethics investigations and that the mainstream media were continuing with unfair attacks on her and her family. Some analysts believe that Palin will seek the 2012 Republican presidential nomination and that her resignation is intended to free her to prepare. Rove, whom Bush dubbed ""the Architect"" for managing his successful presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004, said stepping down now won't lessen the media spotlight on Palin. In fact, he said, leaving the governor's office takes away her platform for controlling her agenda and message. ""The media, if she wants to run for president, is going to be following her for the next 3½ years,"" said Rove, who called the move unclear and therefore a potentially harmful strategy for a politician. ""Effective strategies in politics are ones that are so clear and obvious that people can grasp. ... It's not clear what she's doing and why."" iReport.com: Share thoughts on Palin stepping down . Grassley told the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" that he had ""no insight into why she did it."" ""I would think, if you want to run for president -- and I'm not sure that's got anything to do with what she's doing -- that the forum of a governorship would be a better forum than just being a private citizen,"" the veteran senator said. Will told the ABC program ""This Week"" that he had ""no idea why she did this."" ""The one that rings most hollow is, she doesn't want to put Alaska through the terror of [her] being a lame-duck governor,"" Will said. ""If she is just weary of it, one can understand that. Still, she made a contract with [voters] to serve out her term. And she said, in her own words, she now is a quitter."" Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska criticized Palin's decision as abandoning the state's voters. Palin defeated Murkowski's father the gubernatorial election in 2006. But Alaska Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell, also on the Fox program, said Sunday that Murkowski's statement disappointed him because it failed to recognize all that Palin has accomplished in her 2½ years in office. ""She doesn't need a title to effect change and bring some hope to people who need it,"" said Parnell, a Republican who stands to become governor when Palin steps down this month. iReport.com: Conservative says Palin decision ""not a smart move"" Palin had no public appearances Sunday, but she encouraged her followers via Twitter to ignore the pundits. ""Critics are spinning, so hang in there as they feed false info on the right decision made as I enter last yr in office to not run again,"" her Twitter message said. In an Independence Day message to supporters, Palin said she was leaving office for a ""higher calling."" ""How sad that Washington and the media will never understand; it's about country,"" Palin said in a statement attributed to her on her Facebook page. ""And though it's honorable for countless others to leave their positions for a higher calling and without finishing a term, of course we know by now, for some reason a different standard applies for the decisions I make. But every American understands what it takes to make a decision because it's right for all, including your family."" Palin said her administration had ""accomplished more during this one term than most governors do in two."" ""We have accomplished so much, and there's much more to do, but my family and I determined after prayerful consideration that sacrificing my title helps Alaska most,"" she said. ""And once I decided not to run for re-election, my decision was that much easier. I've never been one to waste time or resources."" iReport.com: ""No solid explanation"" from Palin . Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, noted that Palin will remain in the media spotlight regardless of whether she is governor. ""The challenge that she's going to have is that there will be people who will say, 'Look, if they chased you out of this, it won't get any easier at other levels,' "" Huckabee said. ""It could be a brilliant strategy. The point is, we don't know."" Huckabee called a presidential campaign ""brutal"" and said a Republican primary will ratchet up the pressure on Palin. ""When your opponents within your own team spend millions of dollars to redefine you, it's very, very difficult,"" Huckabee said.

"(CNN) -- A controversial bill that California legislators say would allow the early release of more than 27,000 inmates from crowded prisons will be taken up by the state Assembly on Monday. Inmates at Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, California, interact in a gym modified to house them in August 2007. The Senate on Thursday passed the corrections package 21-19, after Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, assured senators the changes would protect the public from the most violent offenders. The legislation also would direct more resources toward parolees, he said. Senate Republicans say the bill would undermine public safety. All 15 Senate Republicans voted against the measure. Both houses of the legislature are controlled by Democrats. Consideration of the bill comes as California faces a mid-September deadline for reducing its prison population by about 40,000 inmates. A special panel of three federal judges issued the order, contending the crowded prison system violates prisoners' constitutional rights. The judges said they will make the reductions themselves if the state fails to act. The measure would save the financially strapped state $524.5 million, according to a statement from Steinberg's office. When coupled with budget revisions that lawmakers made in July, the total corrections savings would be $1.2 billion, he said. That is the amount that Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger wants as part of his efforts to cut state spending and balance the budget. Republicans said the bill would lead to the release of about 27,000 prisoners, while Democrats estimated it would reduce the prison population by 27,300 in the 2009-10 fiscal year and 37,000 during fiscal year 2010-11. ""It is undeniable that the real failure of our criminal justice system is that it fails to distinguish between violent offenders and nonviolent offenders,"" Steinberg said. ""Of course, we want to keep violent criminals off our streets and out of our communities, and this reform package is a necessary step to do that because it concentrates our incarceration efforts on the violent criminals and ensures that nonviolent offenders have more contact with parole officers,"" he said. Some nonviolent offenders could serve shorter sentences. According to Steinberg, each parole officer in California is responsible for about 70 parolees, many of whom recommit crimes and go back to jail. If the legislation is passed, the ratio would be reduced to 45 to 1, he said. ""They [parole officers] cannot adequately supervise those who are the most at risk and those who are the most risk to the public safety,"" Steinberg said. With a lesser workload, the officers also can make more home visits and arrange more meetings with the people they supervise, the lawmaker said. Senate Republicans called the legislation a threat to public safety. ""Among the inmates who could be eligible for early release under the Democrat plan include felons convicted of human trafficking, stalking, identity theft, violent child abuse and threatening to use a weapon of mass destruction,"" the Republican Caucus said in a written statement. ""Unfortunately, this proposal exploits a fiscal crisis in order to advance a dangerous liberal agenda that seeks to undo successful anti-crime laws,"" said Senate Republican Leader Dennis Hollingsworth of Murrieta. GOP lawmakers in the Senate also strongly opposed the creation of what they described as ""an unelected and unaccountable sentencing commission that would be given broad authority to alter important public safety laws."" The legislation would establish a 16-member Sentencing Commission that would put in place new sentencing guidelines by July 1, 2012. Unless vetoed by the legislature and governor, the guidelines would become effective January 1, 2013. The 13 voting members of the commission would include the chief justice of the California Supreme Court, a judge appointed by the chief justice, the state public defender and the secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. A crime victim would be among the three ex-officio members. California Assembly Speaker Karen Bass, D-Los Angeles, issued a statement early Friday morning, explaining that the assembly recessed around midnight and will reconvene Monday. On Thursday and into Friday morning, she said in the statement, ""we have been taking into account many of the concerns raised by law enforcement, and are working toward a bill that the people of California can agree makes sense,"" and that process will continue through the weekend. ""Our target remains a responsible approach that will achieve our public safety and budgetary goals, and allow us to prevent the wholesale release of prisoners by federal judges."" ""Relieving prison overcrowding and reducing recidivism are monumental challenges, but they are challenges that we will not retreat from,"" Schwarzenegger told an audience of prosecutors in June. California has a 70 percent recidivism rate.","California Senate OKs bill to allow early release of 27,000 inmates .

"CISHAN, Taiwan (CNN) -- Taiwan's leader Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday he accepts responsibility for the government's slow response after Typhoon Morakot slammed into the island killing at more than 120 people and unleashing floods, mudslides and misery. Mourners kneel and pray to the dead as they face the devastated valley of Shiao Lin. Ma, who has faced heavy criticism from victims of the disaster, ruled out resignation, insisting his government did its best in the face of difficulties, however he pledged an investigation into any irregularities. ""Certainly, I will take full responsibility whatever the blame is because, after all, I am the president of this country,"" Ma told CNN, saying heavy rains grounded rescue helicopters in the first few days after the storm hit, delaying relief. ""Once the weather was good -- that is the 14th of August -- we were able to evacuate 2,518 people. It's a record,"" he said. Hundreds of people still await rescue in remote areas of Taiwan, where torrential downpours, dense fog, rugged terrain and raging rivers have hampered relief efforts. Washed-out roads and collapsed bridges have made some rescue operations impossible . Touring disaster areas, Ma has been confronted by angry survivors, and even provoked a scuffle when he opened a weekend baseball game as protesters demanded he step down. Ma has offered apologies and promises to do better. ""We will find out not only to correct the mistakes but (also) to punish the people responsible,"" he said. Rescue efforts were ongoing Sunday with military helicopters bringing stranded villagers to their waiting relatives.  Watch rescue efforts in Taiwan » . Others, waiting days in anguish for word on their loved ones, lashed out in anger. ""Local officials don't care,"" one man said. ""There are still people there and they don't do anything."" On Saturday, weeping relatives of typhoon victims set up shrines near devastated villages to calm the spirits of the dead and honor the belief that their souls will return home after seven days.  Watch mourners call home souls of the dead » . Morakot hit the island last weekend, dropping 2.6 meters (102 inches) of rain. Before it roared on to mainland China on Sunday, the storm killed at least 123 people in Taiwan. The death toll could climb to more than 300 after more villagers buried by mudslides and floodwaters are found, Taiwan officials have said. Southern and central Taiwan were hardest hit by the storm. Mudslides inundated some places in the south, including the village of Shiao Lin, where 160 homes were lost. Authorities believe hundreds of people could be trapped under five stories of mud in the village. International aid efforts were mobilizing on Sunday, however these were complicated by diplomatic pitfalls in the face of China's territorial claims over Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province awaiting reunification. The U.S. military has begun a ""modest"" humanitarian aid mission to Taiwan with the dispatch of a Marine Corps C-130 cargo plane carrying plastic tarpaulins for shelter, U.S. defense officials said. Also Sunday, the USS Denver was en route to the Taiwanese coast with additional humanitarian aid and water purification capabilities, the officials said. The Navy ship is expected to arrive Monday, but officials could not say when it will launch its heavy-lift helicopters to drop the aid. Sources in Washington have said in providing aid to Taiwan, the United States must be sensitive to its territorial relationship with China.

"(CNN)  -- Inspectors have found ""nothing unusual"" in the rest of Southwest Airlines' fleet of 737-300s after a football-sized hole in one of the jets forced an emergency landing, an airline spokeswoman said Tuesday. The breach in the aircraft's fuselage caused a loss of cabin pressure. No passengers were injured. The airline inspected its roughly 200 Boeing 737-300s overnight following the incident that forced Southwest Flight 2294 to make an emergency landing in Charleston, West Virginia. A sudden drop in cabin pressure caused the jet's oxygen masks to deploy, but there were no injuries among the 126 passengers or the five-member crew. Marilee McInnis, a Southwest spokeswoman, said the jets were inspected during non-operational hours overnight, and the cause of the incident remained unknown Tuesday morning. The airline is working closely with the National Transportation Safety Board to investigate the matter, she said. Flight 2294 was at 34,000 feet, en route from Nashville, Tennessee, to Baltimore, Maryland, when the incident happened, McInnis said.  See map of flight path » . ""About 45 minutes into the flight, there was a loud pop. No one really knew what it was,"" passenger Steve Hall told CNN Radio.  Watch as passenger describes watching the hole form » . The plane landed in Charleston at 5:10 p.m. after the crew reported the sudden drop in cabin pressure, which caused the jet's oxygen masks to deploy. ""We were seated about two rows back from the wing, and four rows back you heard this loud rush and your ears popped, and you could tell that part of the inside was trying to pull out,"" passenger Sheryl Bryant told CNN affiliate WBAL-TV upon arriving in Baltimore aboard a replacement plane. ""And it was crazy -- the oxygen masks dropped,"" she continued. She put her mask on her face, then helped her 4- and 6-year-old children with theirs, she said. Bryant tried to stay calm and reassure her children, she said.  Watch Bryant's account of acting brave » . ""My kids and I, we prayed, and then we said, you know, life will be fine,"" she said. Bryant praised the flight crew and ground personnel for keeping passengers informed and for giving clear instructions.

It's very easy for us to begin to take things for granted."" The damaged aircraft was still parked at Charleston's Yeager Airport on Tuesday, when NTSB officials arrived to inspect the plane, airport spokesman Brian Belcher said. A complete inspection could take one to two days, and investigators are expected to interview the passengers and crew as well, he said. The airline is ""doing things"" for the affected passengers on Monday's flight, but McInnis would not say whether they would receive refunds. Both the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident, FAA spokeswoman Holly Baker said. ""There is no responsible way to speculate as to a cause at this point,"" Southwest said in a statement Monday night. ""We have safety procedures in place, and they were followed in this instance to get all passengers and crew safely on the ground,"" the airline said. ""Reports we have are that our passengers were calm and that our pilots and flight attendants did a great job getting the aircraft on the ground safely.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Richard Phillips, the cargo-ship captain whose capture by pirates triggered a dramatic U.S. Navy rescue off the coast of Africa, called on the federal government Thursday to provide military escorts for international shipping vessels. Capt. Richard Phillips, left, and John Clancy, the head of Maersk Line Ltd., testify before a Senate committee. Testifying before a key Senate committee, Phillips conceded there may not be sufficient resources to do that. He also said arming vessels' crews could deter pirates, but should only be allowed in limited circumstances. Phillips was in command of the Maersk Alabama when it was boarded by pirates off the coast of Somalia on April 8. Phillips said the optimum situation for cargo vessels would be to have military escorts. He said he realizes there is a limit to government resources that can be deployed in the vast area off the Somali coast and the Horn of Africa.  See map of attacks » . Phillips told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he would not be opposed to having private security forces on a vessel, but ""very clear protocols would have to be established and followed. ... In the heat of an attack, there can be only one final decision-maker."" Phillips said that, in his opinion, arming a ship's crew ""cannot and should not be viewed as the best or ultimate solution to the problem. ... To the extent we go forward in this direction, it would be my personal preference that only a limited number of individuals aboard the vessel should have access to weapons, and they should be specially trained."" He warned that ""even this limited approach to arming the crews opens up a very thorny set of issues. ... We all must understand that having weapons aboard a merchant marine ship fundamentally changes the model of commercial shipping and we must be very cautious about how it is done."" When the Maersk Alabama was seized, Phillips, 53, offered himself as a hostage in exchange for the safety of his crew. He tried to escape the next day, jumping into the ocean in an effort to reach a nearby U.S. Navy ship. He was rescued April 12 when Navy SEAL snipers shot and killed three pirates holding him captive on a lifeboat. John Clancy, the head of Maersk Line Ltd., said arming sailors could potentially worsen the current situation off the African coast. ""Arming merchant sailors may result in the acquisition of even more lethal weapons and tactics by the pirates in a race that merchant sailors cannot win,"" Clancy told the committee. ""In addition, most ports of call will not permit the introduction of firearms into the national waters,"" he noted. Clancy said the solution to piracy must ultimately be an international one. He pointed out that most of the vessels that face a piracy threat do not fly the U.S. flag. He also noted that most of the naval vessels assigned to counter piracy off the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden are not from the United States. Somali pirate attacks in and around the heavily traveled Gulf of Aden have risen dramatically in the past few years. Pirates have been able to successfully demand ransoms for millions of dollars from shipping companies -- for whom it makes business sense to pay in order to free their crews and many millions of dollars more worth of cargo. The attack on the Alabama was the first successful attack on a U.S.-flagged ship during that time. ""The renewed threat of piracy demands a multifaceted, multinational effort, one that coordinates the world's naval powers, the United Nations, the international shipping community, and the nations that border Somalia,"" said Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, at the start of the committee's hearing. ""International law is clear in its condemnation of piracy. This is an opportunity for all nations to come together and work in order to effectively respond."" Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on the committee, stated that the ""root cause of this problem is the breakdown of law and order in Somalia, which is what allows the pirates to operate from shore with impunity."" Lugar warned that ""the existence of failed states directly threatens the national security interests of the United States."" Meanwhile, the bodies of the three pirates killed by the Navy SEALs were turned over to Somali authorities Thursday, according to a U.S. defense official with knowledge of the matter but not authorized to speak about it. The bodies were being held on the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer until the U.S. State Department could arrange a transfer. The official said the bodies were turned over to police authorities from Puntland, a self-declared autonomous state in northern Somalia. Two police boats from the Puntland town of Bosasso met the Boxer to receive the bodies, the official said. It was unclear if the bodies will be returned to family members.","Capt.

"(CNN) -- When Saddam Hussein's elite Republican Guard invaded Kuwait in 1990, they brought back some unusual war booty to Baghdad: tapes of the region's ""Sesame Street"" show. Troops also took a Muppet camel. Haneen and Karim are two of the Muppet stars in ""Shara'a Simsim,"" the Palestinian version of ""Sesame Street."" The camel, Cookie Monster and the other Sesame friends immediately became permanent POWs in Iraq. ""To this day, they've never been recovered,"" Sesame Workshop President and CEO Gary Knell said. ""That's how much the show is loved there."" That ""kidnapping"" is just one example of Sesame Street's devoted global following. And Sesame is trying to use that following to foster a culture of understanding worldwide, beginning with children. In the Palestinian territories, Muppets teach nonviolence on a local version of Sesame Street called ""Shara'a Simsim."" Sesame Workshop calls this effort ""Muppet diplomacy."" ""This means using our characters -- characters children love and parents trust -- to bridge some of the world's most intractable divides,"" Knell said. ""Muppets give children, and the parents who watch the show with them, a chance to explore other cultures from the safety of their living room, where no one will criticize them for being curious."" Daoud Kuttab, executive producer of ""Shara'a Simsim,"" knows that the Muppets are highly effective communicators. ""Anything the Muppets do, anything they say, any idea they transmit, the children accept.""  Watch a clip from the Palestinian version of ""Sesame Street"" » . An internationally respected Palestinian journalist, Kuttab began working with the show more than a decade ago. After covering the war-torn region for years, he realized that Sesame was a great way to reach Palestinian children who desperately needed an alternative to the harsh lessons they were absorbing. ""I would say 3-, 4-, 5-year olds -- if we don't catch them at that early age, we do risk losing them to all kinds of propaganda, whether it's conservative, religious or fundamentalist,"" Kuttab said. Hamas television runs a weekly program for kids, that sometimes preaches violent resistance. ""They have to be willing, prepared for the future. And that's why the Palestinians are showing seriousness,"" said Ahmed Yousef, a political leader in Hamas, the party in power in Gaza. ""To keep our dignity and our independence, we have to sacrifice our life. We are either victorious, or we die for the good cause."" With some funding from the U.S. State Department and guidance from the U.S. producers, Kuttab's team developed the Sesame program into something uniquely Palestinian, complete with live-action segments filmed in the West Bank and Gaza, a set that looks like a typical Palestinian street and Muppets named Haneen and Karim.  Watch Palestinian Americans trying to instill peace in society's youngest members » . ""We are interested in teaching tolerance, respect, pride in their own country and their own nation, and also in understanding that there are people who are different, and that's OK,"" Kuttab said. Worldwide influence . Sesame's influential roots go back decades. The creators of ""Sesame Street"" launched the show in the 1960s to fill a gap in American education. Studies had presented compelling evidence that solid early education was vital for a child's later learning; still, public pre-kindergartens were scarce, and early education was rarely available to underprivileged children. Although it was designed to address an American need, Sesame Street had immediate global appeal. In the 1970s, German producers put their version of the show on air. Today, children in 120 countries watch some version of ""Sesame Street."" ""When I saw [Sinn Fein leader] Gerry Adams wearing a Cookie Monster watch,"" Sesame Workshop's Knell said, ""I knew we had made it in Northern Ireland."" The program has always found fun and funny ways to teach reading and counting. But interspersed with those ABCs and 123s are lessons in cooperation, tolerance and mutual respect. It wasn't by accident that Sesame was a multiracial street as far back as the 1960s. Its creators wanted children to understand that integration was OK, a message so controversial at the time that ""Sesame Street"" was banned by some TV stations in the U.S. South. Those social messages help explain Sesame Street's appeal to television programmers around the globe. Still, what's an important issue in one country may not be in another. That's why Sesame Workshop has helped local producers create customized versions of the show in more than 20 countries. In South Africa, for instance, a country where one in nine children is an AIDS orphan, ""Takalani Street"" producers pushed to create a Muppet who is HIV-positive while the South African government was still coming to grips with the country's AIDS epidemic. ""The local producers knew it was important for children to see an AIDS orphan who still has a sunny disposition and lots of friends, even while being very open that she is infected,"" Knell said. ""This had a great impact on destigmatizing people with the disease."" In Tanzania, Muppets teach malaria prevention. In Egypt, Muppets stress the importance of girls' education. Haneen and Karim . In the Palestinian version, ""Shara'a Simsim,"" direct references to the region's political situation are not included. The Muppets like Haneen and Karim show pride in their own culture but also understanding that there are differences in the world. And Karim, an upbeat young rooster Muppet, aims to provide a healthy role model for boys. ""Boys are a problem in our society. They see their parents being humiliated. They think they are the men of the house and have to do something about it. But they can't do anything,"" Kuttab said. ""We're trying to tell them, 'your energy is OK, but let's channel it in a different way.' "" Live-action segments introduce children to Palestinians who have channeled their energy into becoming teachers, doctors or business owners -- people, Knell says, ""who can act as role models, people who strive to remove themselves from the hardships children see."" Sesame Workshop hopes to expand this type of localized programming into other areas that have witnessed recent conflict, such as Pakistan. Perhaps that means Iraq will get its own show someday and won't have to hold on to someone else's.","Children in 120 countries watch some version of ""Sesame Street""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Don't let Jack Johnson fool you. Jack Johnson makes sure his business and his concert venues are environmentally friendly. Tabbed as a ""mellow rocker"" by perhaps one too many publications, the chart-topping singer-songwriter has a fire within that belies his laid-back manner -- a fire that extends to his company, Brushfire Records, and his environmental activism. Johnson started the record label in 2002 ""as a way to put out soundtracks for surf movies we were making,"" he says. ""Then our friends G. Love and Special Sauce were coming to the end of their record deal with another label, and the idea came up to put out their stuff."" The Hawaii-based artist -- whose latest album ""Sleep Through the Static"" hit No. 1 in the U.S. and sold over 2 million albums worldwide -- has continued to assemble talent. The label's roster now includes indie-rockers Rogue Wave, folk-pop musician Mason Jennings and keyboardist Money Mark. Johnson says the record label is not driven by dollar signs. ""We never try to talk anybody into joining the label, but we just offer a lot of creative control over all their music and a fairer deal than with most other labels,"" he explains.  Watch Johnson, Zach Gill and Money Mark perform ""Hope"" » . Rogue Wave frontman Zach Schwartz is one of the converts. ""The music business is traditionally pretty cutthroat, nasty and evil, but [with Brushfire], it is not that way,"" he tells CNN. ""You can make the music you want to make."" Still, even in these major-label-dominated times, artist-friendly labels aren't unusual; Dave Matthews has also attracted talent with his ATO Records. It's in making Brushfire a model of green business that Johnson and his colleagues have stood out. As keen environmentalists, Johnson and his team have required Brushfire and its distributors to engage in earth-friendly implementations that have influenced others in the record business. ""The music is one thing, but there is this business side,"" says Zach Gill, a Brushfire solo artist and member of Johnson's touring band. ""I think more and more businesses are saying, 'Yeah, we want to be responsible. Responsible to our employees. Responsible for the waste our company generates.' We're starting to see that a lot in all kinds of businesses, not just in music,"" he says.  Watch Gill and Johnson perform ""Family"" » . Entertainment industry giant Universal Music Group -- the largest family of record labels in the recording industry -- has taken notice. Under Brushfire's direction, UMG uses recycled stock on all of the packaging for its releases, including movies, ensuring that the paper is as environmentally friendly as possible. Some is even made using wind power. Moreover, Brushfire's artists have exerted their eco-influence on venues and promoters for concert tours worldwide. The tour rider, a checklist of artists' requirements at each venue, usually consists of specific brands of beer or (in one case involving Jennifer Lopez) the way the coffee is stirred. Brushfire uses an EnviroRider, a handbook of eco-friendly options and actions for various components of concert tour production. ""It gets augmented every year. What started out as suggestions are now becoming requirements [for us to play at a venue],"" says Johnson. Johnson and his management also created All At Once, a social action network that provides tools and information to people who want to become more involved in their community and worldwide. Visitors to the All At Once area at tour venues will be rewarded with exclusive music downloads by their favorite Brushfire artists. Johnson's charity, Ohana Charitable Foundation, will match any donation (up to $2,500) to nonprofits made by fans at the shows or online. ""We shrink our carbon footprint always, but we have all these nonprofit groups that we all work with,"" says Johnson. ""Money from the shows goes to these groups and helps bolster their memberships so that after we leave the town, these groups can continue to do good things. So more than just lessening our negative [environmental] impact, it's actually leaving a positive impact [wherever we tour],"" says Johnson. Additional actions taken by Brushfire tours will include fueling tour vehicles with sustainable biodiesel, offering eco-friendly merchandise, working with venues to create waste management programs, onsite recycling and encouraging fans to use alternative transportation. Back at home, Brushfire has adopted a similar strategy. All the power for the recording studios and the offices is generated by solar panels. Insulation is supplied by cotton from scraps of blue jeans. Energy-efficient lighting runs throughout the building. Second-hand furniture is all you will find in its offices. The mission resonates with the other artists on the label's roster. ""For me, it's so great to be a part of the label because so many people provide information about what we can do to make it better -- touring more efficiently, biodiesel -- stuff like that,"" says Jennings. ""I'm learning a ton being around those guys."" At bottom, the atmosphere of collaboration and common purpose is rooted in the shared love of music, says Gill. ""Music is the great synchronizer. They've become quite a wonderful community to be a part of. I feel grateful to Jack for having the idea to bring together all these like-minded people to make music together,"" he says. Johnson agrees. ""It's everything. It is the whole reason to play music. I learn so much from playing with these other musicians,"" he says.","Jack Johnson has artist-friendly record label, Brushfire Records .

"(CNN) -- From the mid-1980s, Hungarian-born investor and philanthropist George Soros pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into foundations in Eastern Europe dedicated to promoting the idea of the ""open society"" and challenging the region's Soviet-backed regimes. Here, writing exclusively for CNN.com, he describes how the work of his foundations ultimately contributed to the collapse of communism. A Soviet tank rolls through Budapest during the failed 1956 Hungarian uprising against communist domination. I set up my first foundation in Hungary in 1984. The idea behind it was simple. The state dogma, promoted by the ruling communists, was false and by providing an alternative we could expose its falsehood. Accordingly we supported every cultural initiative that was not an expression of the established dogma. I was guided by the concept of the ""open society,"" which I adopted from the philosopher Karl Popper. I saw the open society as a more sophisticated form of social organization than the totalitarian closed societies of the Soviet bloc. The latter were trying to implement central plans; in an open society every individual or organization was supposed to implement their own plan. To make the transition from a closed to an open society would require outside help and that was what my foundations sought to provide. In Hungary the authorities insisted on having a controlling presence on the foundation's board. We eventually agreed to appoint two chief executives, one nominated by them and one by me. The project succeeded beyond my expectations. With very small amounts of money people could engage in a wide variety of civic initiatives ranging from self-governing student colleges to zither clubs. One of our first projects was to offer photocopying machines to cultural and scientific institutions in exchange for local currency. We used the money to give out local grants and support all kinds of unofficial initiatives, but the photocopying machines also did a lot of good. Up until then, the few existing copy machines were literally held under lock and key -- as more and more became available, the Party apparatus lost control of the machines and the dissemination of information. We did not have to exercise direct control. Civil society watched over the foundation. For instance, we were warned that a blind association, to whom we gave a grant for talking books, was stealing some of the money. With a budget of $3 million, the foundation had more influence on the cultural life of Hungary than the Ministry of Culture. Carried away my success in Hungary, by 1988 I had set up foundations in Poland, China and the Soviet Union. I think that I could have influenced General Jaruzelski in Poland to change his attitude toward the opposition and to see that dissidents such as Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron were also patriots despite their criticism of the ruling party. As the Soviet empire collapsed, and eventually the Soviet Union and also Yugoslavia disintegrated, we continued to expand. By 1992 there were foundations in 22 countries and expenditure had reached $53 million. A year later we were spending nearly $184 million. Right at the beginning, I had a disagreement with the Polish board about the way the foundation should be run. But that taught me a lesson. They were right and I was wrong. I realized that the people living there understood their country better than I did and I deferred to their judgment. It did not always work. In Bulgaria, a board member who made his name as a human rights activist turned out to be a racist. A Latvian businessman sought to hijack the foundation for nationalist purposes. It was the Russian foundation that gave us the most trouble; we had to reorganize it twice. But the foundations were the first out of the gate everywhere. I remembered the lesson my father who had lived through the Russian Revolution in Siberia taught me: In revolutionary times things that are normally impossible become possible. In Ukraine, we set up the Ukrainian Renaissance Foundation before Ukraine became independent. In Tajikistan, we persevered with the foundation during the five-year civil war although we had no way of controlling its activities. Our impact was the greatest during that turbulent period. When I set up the foundations in Eastern Europe I hoped the open societies of the West would follow in my footsteps, but in that regard I was disappointed. Unwilling to burden their own budgets, they gave the job to the International Monetary Fund, which was ill suited to the task. The IMF was accustomed to signing letters of intent with governments, making the continuation of their programs conditional on the governments fulfilling their obligations. The countries of Eastern Europe fared better, but in the former Soviet states one after another, the programs largely failed. East Germany was the exception: West Germany was willing to make the sacrifices that were necessary to integrate it. Eventually, the countries of Eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, also made the grade when the European Union gave them accession. But the rest of the former Soviet Union in the Caucasus and Central Asia never succeeded in making the transition. This has left a bitter legacy. Rightly or wrongly, both the rulers and the people of Russia harbor a deep resentment against the West, which the West has not come to grips with. The new order in Moscow that has emerged out of the chaos of the 1990s is very far from an open society. It is an authoritarian regime that preserves the outward appearances of democracy but derives its power from its control of Russia's national resources. It uses those resources to maintain itself in power, to personally enrich the rulers, and to exercise influence over its neighborhood, both in Europe and in the former Soviet sphere. But the ideal of an open society is difficult to suppress and I have not given up hope.","Financier George Soros funded eastern European dissident groups in 1980s .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The FBI says it found child pornography on a computer used by the man charged with the fatal shooting of a security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum June 10. Museum shooting suspect James von Brunn remains in a Washington hospital. In court documents filed Wednesday, an investigator says the pornography was found on a desktop computer during a search of an Annapolis, Maryland, apartment where 88-year old James von Brunn had been living for the past two years. The documents did not provide details about the pornography, but investigators requested permission to make a more extensive search of the computer and others found in von Brunn's home. Von Brunn has been charged with the murder of museum security guard Stephen Johns. The white supremacist was shot in the face after two other security officers returned fire. He remains in a Washington hospital. The FBI also searched a red Hyundai that law enforcement officials say von Brunn left double-parked in front of the museum right before the shooting. In separate documents also filed on Wednesday, investigators say they found 35 rounds of live ammunition for a .22 caliber rifle. Officials allege von Brunn used a .22 caliber rifle, which was found at the scene, to shoot Johns in the chest. According to paperwork detailing the car search, investigators found business cards advertising a USS Liberty Web site that claims Israeli forces ""suddenly and brutally"" attacked the U.S. Navy vessel in international waters in 1967. Investigators also found business cards for von Brunn's own Web site, which hosts postings of white supremacist writings. Among other items found in the car were a disabled parking permit, mouthwash, a salt shaker and a roll of quarters totaling $7.25. Earlier this week investigators filed papers saying among the items discovered in von Brunn's apartment was a painting that appeared to depict Hitler and Jesus. They also found a .30-30 rifle, ammunition and a handwritten will.","Computer found in apartment of 88-year old James von Brunn .

"FORT BRAGG, North Carolina (CNN) -- Marylisa Miller has spent much of her two decades as an Army wife bracing for the worst. But now the pressure is higher, as both her husband and their 20-year-old son are serving together in Afghanistan. Pfc. Martin Miller, left, and his dad, Sgt. 1st Class Martin Miller,  serve in the same Army squadron in Afghanistan. It's rare, but not unheard of: Sgt. 1st Class Martin Miller and his son Pfc. Martin Miller have deployed as part of the same squadron of about 500 soldiers. Their brigade --  based at North Carolina's Fort Bragg -- is among the first specifically assigned to train Afghan security and military forces. ""If the phone rings in the middle of the night, I answer it no matter what,"" said Marylisa Miller. ""You never know. It could be the last call.""  Watch the Millers talk about serving together » . The Miller men -- both paratroopers -- didn't really plan to march shoulder-to-shoulder into harm's way. It just sort of happened that way. ""I pretty much have always wanted to be in the Army,"" said Pfc. Miller, who remembers watching his dad leap out of military aircraft with other soldiers in the 82nd Airborne Division. ""I guess watching him do it -- it looked cool,"" he said. Shortly before they deployed in August, the Millers revisited family memories at Fort Bragg's Wilson Park -- the same spot where the couple picnicked with their toddler son and daughter years ago. Telling family stories, the Millers laughed about old snapshots showing the future private first class as a boy -- standing at parade rest while his father spoke to him. ""When I scolded him and his sister, I taught them to stand at parade rest,"" Sgt. Miller explained. ""Then their punishment would be laps, flutter kicks, push-ups and sit-ups. It taught discipline and put them in good shape."" After high school, dad convinced his son to try a year of college first. Soldiers with college degrees go further in the service, Sgt. Miller said. But a year later it was clear the young man's interests were in the Army. After all, growing up with a warrior father tends to influence a boy. Sgt. Miller did what he could to have his son stationed at Fort Bragg. He ended up in the same squadron. The father and son describe themselves as close. ""Yeah, we're always doing something together,"" Pfc. Miller said. ""We go out and party together and we fish and ride motorcycles."" Walking together wearing red Airborne berets marked with their distinctive squadron flashes, the Millers talked about what it means to be a military family and how this life of service often extends to civilian spouses and children. ""Back when I was a kid, there were a lot of people who saw the Army as something good,"" said Sgt. Miller, 46, who enlisted a year out of high school. ""Everybody should do a little bit for their country."" Although the Millers serve in the same squadron, they are in different troops -- and therefore don't share the same chain of command. ""He can't work directly for me,"" Sgt Miller said. ""Family members are not supposed to work directly for other family members. But my platoon possibly would work with his."" Unlike his previous tours of duty, Sgt. Miller now bears two heavy burdens: command and fatherhood. The possibility that his son could lose his life while serving in the same squadron has crossed his mind. ""If something happens to him, I can still function, but it won't be pretty,"" the sergeant said. ""But knowing others depend on me, I can't get all broken up about it. If something were going to happen to him, I'd probably break when I got back."" 'Navy brat' Marylisa Miller has known the military since birth. She is the seventh of eight ""Navy brats"" born to a father who chose a sailor's life and moved his family from assignment to assignment. In the early '80s she met the man who would be her warrior husband. Shyly, she said they met in a bar. ""It wasn't a bar,"" her husband said, smiling. ""They say she's kind of like me: kind of hard-headed, a little bit stubborn and not afraid to voice my opinion."" Marylisa laughed about their first meeting: ""I was trying to get him interested in my sister."" Instead, she and Martin ""just clicked."" They married six months later. Sgt. Miller has served in Cold War Europe, the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. He said being away from his wife doesn't get any easier. ""After you hit the 12-month mark, and then it turns into 15, it feels like forever after that,"" he said. The Millers have chosen a life in which Marylisa may not hear her husband's voice for three or four months at a time. Over the years, she said, she has learned to rely on herself. ""He would come home from deployments and say, 'Let me help you,' and I'd say 'No, because when you're not here, who's going to do it for me?' "" ""I have to learn how to be independent, so I try to tell everybody else to learn how to do it yourself,"" Marylisa said. ""You can't always rely on them."" 'I don't want to think about if the phone's gonna ring' She stays busy. At Fort Bragg, Marylisa is the co-leader of a Family Readiness Group, the Army's support group aimed at helping spouses, children and others make the best of difficult military deployments. ""I always like to be involved in everything,"" she said, laughing. ""That way you get to hear the information firsthand."" The network of Army families provides a conduit of information on deployments and upcoming events. FRGs offer Marylisa a way to help other families. ""We have a lot of new families in the troop,"" she said. ""Some of them are young and we try to guide them in the right direction. When someone gets hurt, we're all right there to jump in. It's like an extended family."" She recalled an FRG request to help a young Army wife with a newborn baby. ""I jumped in and baby-sat her child,"" she said. ""She didn't know me from the man in the moon."" Volunteering keeps her away from TV news and its reminders that terrible events could be moments away. ""I don't want to think about if the phone's going to ring or if there's going to be that knock on the door."" 'I should have been dead' The Millers' 4th Brigade Combat Team will be the first such unit designated for ""security force assistance"" in Afghanistan, said an Army spokeswoman. The brigade will train Afghan forces to battle Taliban and al Qaeda fighters. In the past, this kind of mission was given to small teams of advisers who were trained in the United States and then deployed in the region. This is the first time an entire brigade has been given this mission, according to the Army. The sergeant has embraced the view that there's nothing much a soldier can do except depend on his or her training to stay safe. ""I've had mortars come within 20 meters of me and not get a scratch out of it. I should have been dead,"" Sgt. Miller said. ""You see something happen like that and you know it's not your time until it's your time."" His son, not long out of jump school -- he has just seven jumps to his credit -- said he's not worried about himself or his father. ""He ain't gonna die. He's too old for it now,"" Pfc. Miller joked. ""He has deployed too many times. He knows the secrets.""","The Millers,  father-and-son soldiers,  serve in the same squadron in Afghanistan .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Pregnant women in Peru are dying at scandalous rates, according to the author of an Amnesty International report into maternal mortality in the South American country. Vertical births where women are kneeling or crouching and holding on to a rope are common in Peru. The report, ""Fatal Flaws: Barriers to Maternal Health in Peru"" found that hundreds of poor, rural and indigenous pregnant women are dying because they are being denied the same health services as other women in the country. It also concluded that the government's response to tackling the problem was inadequate. Peruvian government figures state 185 in every 100,000 women die in child birth, but the United Nations says the number is much higher at 240, which makes it one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the Americas. In wealthy developed nations, only nine women die for every 100,000 births. The five main causes of pregnancy-related deaths in Peru are hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, infection, complications following abortion and obstructed birth, according to Peru's Ministry of Health figures. Amnesty's Peru researcher Nuria Garcia said in a statement: ""The rates of maternal mortality in Peru are scandalous. The fact that so many women are dying from preventable causes is a human rights violation. ""The Peruvian state is simply ignoring its obligation to provide adequate maternal healthcare to all women, regardless of who they are and where they live."" Garcia added: ""Health services for pregnant women in Peru are like a lottery: if you are poor and indigenous, the chances are you will always lose."" Amnesty's report highlighted the case of Criselda, a  22-year-old indigenous woman from the country's Huancavelica Department, one of the poorest regions of the country. While seven months pregnant, she fell and hurt herself, and after feeling pains, she went to the health post for a check-up. The doctor said she was fine and sent her away but she miscarried two days later, according to the report. The report found that so many women are dying because they face a number of barriers, including a lack of health staff who speak indigenous languages like Quechua -- a native Andean language spoken by some five million people in Peru. However, the vast majority of Peruvian doctors only speak Spanish, as they rarely come from areas or communities where indigenous languages are spoken. Criselda told researchers she believes the doctor may not have picked up her symptoms accurately because she could not understand her, and interpreters were not available. Transport problems are also a contributing factor to the high mortality rate among Peruvian indigenous women, as most of them usually have to travel long distances to a health center to get attention, the report found. Criselda's husband Fortunato said in the report: ""There is no ambulance when there is an emergency. To go from here it takes us two or three days and sometimes they die right here because there is no vehicle or ambulance."" According to the report, 27 percent of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes occurred during pregnancy; 26 percent occurred during the birth itself; and 46 percent during the first six weeks after giving birth. Amnesty has urged the Peruvian government to allocate resources to maternal mortality and reproductive health, prioritizing the regions with the highest mortality ratios. The organization also recommends an increase in training, particularly in indigenous languages.","New Amnesty report says Peru's poor pregnant women dying of neglect .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's daughter touched the hearts of millions when she bid a tearful farewell to her father at his memorial service in a rare public appearance. Paris Jackson, 11, is consoled by her uncle Marlon Jackson after delivering a tearful tribute to her father. With her brief speech, 11-year-old Paris Jackson also shocked the event's organizers, who said her appearance was not a planned part of Tuesday's star-studded tribute to the ""King of Pop"" at Los Angeles' Staples Center. ""Ever since I was born, daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine,"" she said, fighting back tears as relatives consoled her. ""And I just want to say that I love him so much,"" she said as she burst into tears and sought refuge in the embrace of family members.  Watch her emotional goodbye » . For many watching, Paris' appearance marked a rare glimpse of a child who has spent most of her life shielded from the public. Born to two mothers -- Jackson's ex-wife Debbie Rowe and an unidentified woman who reportedly served as a surrogate -- Jackson's three children lived and traveled the world with him, their faces often covered by veils and masks when appearing in public. In its execution, the speech appeared to be a surprise to those onstage and off. ""It was a surprise they were there. All of us who know them were delighted they were strong enough to come and feel this love and great outpouring for their dad,"" Kenny Ortega, the choreographer (""Dirty Dancing"") who was directing Jackson's ""This Is It"" comeback concerts in London, England, told CNN's Campbell Brown. ""We would've never expected that they had the strength. It was beautiful.""  Watch Ortega express his surprise at Paris Jackson's tribute » . Ortega, a longtime Jackson colleague who helped design the singer's 1990s tours, said planners left the end of the show open for family members to speak if they wished to, but he was surprised when the Jackson clan -- among them, his siblings and children -- went onstage for the two last songs, ""We Are the World"" and ""Heal the World."" Marlon Jackson told the crowd that his sister, pop star Janet Jackson, wished to say some words. Instead, Janet appeared to encourage Paris to come forward from the sea of black dresses and suits and take the microphone, adjusting it and stroking the child's hair as Paris delivered her words. Ortega said he was touched by Paris' speech. ""Michael was so close with these beautiful children,"" he said. ""Little Paris was his biggest fan. ... A little girl couldn't love her papa more."" The heartfelt display sparked a groundswell of emotion in the auditorium and around the world, where millions of viewers watched the service on television and the Internet. ""The saddest moment was when Michael Jackson's daughter spoke,"" said Angelina Martinez, who attended the service with her daughter, Jessica. ""She was really in pain. Everybody was crying inside,"" she said. ""It was beauty combined with sadness."" Attendees, performers and speakers alike struggled for composure throughout the two-plus-hour event, which featured performances from Lionel Richie, Jennifer Hudson and Usher. But to many, Paris' tribute cast Jackson in the one role few have experienced him as: a father. ""It was very, very touching, and really it was an example of the good parent Michael was, because when I was at Neverland and with the kids he really was a good loving father -- they had a fantastic relationship, and they were very close-knit,"" Stuart Backerman said. ""So to see Paris come on in such an emotional moment and obviously give her heart out to her father was very, very touching."" Others saw the tribute as a whole as Jackson's final legacy to his children. ""There are those I feel in years to come, will try to distort him to his children ... and not understand that the real challenges that Michael Jackson had to seriously face and did face and make a difference,"" the Rev. Al Sharpton said. ""And I thought it was very important to put in context for his children what he dealt with in history and what he was able to do.""","Planners of Michael Jackson memorial say they did not know daughter would speak .

"PENSACOLA, Florida (CNN)  -- A fourth suspect has been arrested in the shooting deaths of a Gulf Coast couple known for adopting special-needs children, authorities said late Monday. Police say they have evidence that places Gary Lamont Sumner at the crime scene. Gary Lamont Sumner faces a murder charge for his alleged role in the deaths of Byrd and Melanie Billings on Thursday, Escambia County, Florida, Sheriff David Morgan said. Sumner was pulled over in a traffic stop in Okaloosa County Sunday and arrested after authorities found he matched a description put out by Escambia authorities. Police believe six to eight people were involved in the homicides, which occurred in the couple's home in Beulah, west of Pensacola, near the Alabama state line.  Watch surveillance video of the home invasion » . The crime was ""a very well-planned and methodical operation,"" Morgan said. Wayne Coldiron, 41; Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr., 35, and Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Sr., 56, were arrested over the weekend. Coldiron and the younger Gonzalez face charges of murder, robbery and residential home invasion; the elder Gonzalez faces charges of evidence tampering for allegedly trying to disguise a vehicle spotted at the home. Morgan said at least three others are persons of interests in the investigation. ""We expect more arrests to be imminent,"" Morgan told reporters. Both of the Billingses were shot multiple times, Morgan said, but he would not release further details on their deaths. Authorities released two surveillance tapes taken from the front and rear of the Billingses' home. Each shows a vehicle pulling up to the property, and five people dressed in black and wearing masks entering the home through two entrances -- including through a utility door left unlocked, something Morgan said is not uncommon in the community. Authorities believe drivers remained in both of the cars. Investigators believe one motive in the deaths was robbery, but ""we believe there are other motives,"" Morgan said. He would not say what, if anything, was taken from the home. Melanie Billings' biological daughter, Ashley Markham, told reporters the couple initially had 17 children -- two biological children each for Byrd and Melanie Billings, with the rest adopted. Three have died over the years, she said. The couple had no biological children together.  Watch Ashley Markham say, ""Love was never scarce"" in Billings home » . Morgan, however, said the couple had a total of 16 children, with two that have died and others that have grown older and no longer live in the Billingses' home. Nine of the couple's children were home at the time of the incident, Morgan said, and police believe three of them saw the intruders. One managed to flee the home and seek help at a neighbor's house, the sheriff said. Coldiron and the younger Gonzalez were being held on $1 million bond, according to records posted on the sheriff's Web site. The senior Gonzalez was being held on $250,000 bond. One of the first three arrested is believed to be the mastermind behind the crime, Morgan said, but would not say which one.  Watch a report on the arrests in the complex case » . Police also released a surveillance photo taken at a Wal-Mart in nearby Gulf Breeze, Florida, recently. Two of the people in the photo are Sumner and the younger Gonzalez, but authorities want to know who the other man is, Morgan said. The sheriff called the surveillance tapes ""chilling."" He noted the vehicles were at the home less than 10 minutes, and the five people were in the house less than four minutes. ""It leads me to believe that this was a very well-planned and methodical operation,"" Morgan said.  Watch experts describe the ""military-style"" attack » . Although the Billingses were well known in the community, the sheriff said authorities are still trying to unravel why they were targeted. He compared their deaths to the slaying of the Clutter family of Kansas, inspiration for Truman Capote's novel ""In Cold Blood,"" noting the Clutter murders were something the community struggled with for years. ""It will be a very long time, I believe, until we piece together the truth of why this family was selected,"" Morgan said. Police believe the suspects might have bought the clothes they wore to the home and were reviewing surveillance tapes and photos from several stores, he said. Morgan said the crime's complexity is frustrating for investigators, comparing it to a complicated mathematics or word problem that lacks complete information. ""It seems as though each phase we complete, while we answer a set of questions, it opens up an additional set of questions."" Earlier, he said the complete story, when revealed, is ""going to be a humdinger."" Asked whether the suspects entered the home planning to kill the couple, Morgan said authorities do not know. Markham said earlier the family does not know any of the three suspects. She said the children ""are coping very well"" and are being cared for. ""They haven't asked too many questions,"" she said, noting that several have disabilities. While the investigation continues, the family is keeping the children's whereabouts a secret.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's father says he is concerned about the last moments of his son's life and about the personal physician who found the pop icon unconscious at the singer's estate. Singer Ne-Yo (L) and host Jamie Foxx pay tribute to Michael Jackson at 2009 BET Awards in Los Angeles. ""I have a lot of concerns,"" Joe Jackson told CNN's Don Lemon on the red carpet leading up to the BET Awards ceremony Sunday night. ""I can't get into that, but I don't like what happened."" Michael Jackson's personal physician, who was questioned extensively by investigators over the weekend, found the singer not breathing in bed when he entered the singer's estate last week, according to the law firm representing the doctor. However, Jackson did have a slight pulse when Dr. Conrad Murray discovered him Thursday, and Murray tried to resuscitate the singer as he awaited paramedics, a representative with the law firm of Stradley, Chernoff and Alford law firm in Houston, Texas, told CNN Sunday. Attorney Edward Chernoff is representing Murray. The law firm said reports that Murray injected Jackson with powerful painkillers, such as Demerol or Oxycontin, were false. Funeral arrangements for Jackson were pending Sunday. ""We haven't gotten to that yet -- we're working on that,"" Joe Jackson told CNN's Lemon.  Watch Joe Jackson talk about the death of his son » . Murray voluntarily met for several hours with detectives, the Los Angeles Police Department said late Saturday night. ""Detectives assigned to Robbery-Homicide Division met with Dr. Murray and conducted an extensive interview,"" a police statement said. ""Dr. Murray was cooperative and provided information which will aid the investigation.""  Watch attorney for Jackson's doctor say his client is not a suspect » . Jackson's family suspects that Murray can answer some lingering questions about the singer's last hours, but they have been unable to contact him, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Saturday. ""The routine inquiry is now an investigation,"" Jesse Jackson said. ""They (Jackson's family) didn't know the doctor. ... He should have met with the family, given them comfort on the last hours of their son.""  Watch latest developments in Jackson's death investigation » . Jackson family attorney L. Londell McMillan told CNN that a second autopsy is ""under way."" ""We'll let that process take its course,"" McMillan, who accompanied Joe Jackson to the BET Awards, told CNN. McMillan said a will has not surfaced since Michael Jackson's death and that the singer's mother, Katherine Jackson, is seeking custody of his two children. ""Well, if there is no will, then under the state of California it goes to the next of kin. That's an adult to administer and oversee the best interests of the children and that would be Mr. and Mrs. Jackson,"" McMillan said. ""And Katherine Jackson is the duly appointed person."" He added, ""She will seek custody of the children. That's who Michael would have wanted to have the children, she loves them dearly."" On Saturday, the founder of 1-800-AUTOPSY, a private firm that conducts autopsies, told CNN that the Jackson family had contacted the business to inquire about possibly having a second autopsy done there. Jesse Jackson added on Saturday that the family needed ""an independent autopsy to get even more answers to questions that are now being driven by the gap between when Michael was last seen alive and was pronounced dead.""iReport.com: Tributes pour in for Jackson . There are lingering questions, including: ""How long had he stopped breathing? How long had he been unconscious?"" Jesse Jackson said. Michael Jackson was discovered unconscious Thursday by paramedics at his home, where Murray apparently had tried to revive him. He was rushed to a Los Angeles medical center, where he was pronounced dead.  Listen to the 911 call » . An autopsy performed by a county medical examiner was inconclusive -- although officials said there were no indications of external trauma or foul play. The Los Angeles County coroner's office has said more tests are needed before a cause of death can be determined. That could take four to six weeks. Detectives impounded Murray's car, which was parked at the singer's rented home, because, they said, it may contain evidence related to Jackson's death, possibly prescription medications. Police have released no information on what they may have found. CNN's Ted Rowlands, Traci Tamura, Drew Griffin and Anna Coren contributed to this report.","Dr. Conrad Murray found Jackson not breathing but with a slight pulse .

"Editor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. He is the co-editor of ""Rightward Bound: Making America Conservative in the 1970s"" and is completing a book on the history of national-security politics since World War II, to be published by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely on current events. Julian Zelizer says Obama and Congress must decide whether to rein in presidential power. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- Executive power has been one of the defining characteristics of President George W. Bush's administration. President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and many members of the White House pushed to expand executive power -- as much as any specific domestic or foreign policy -- from the beginning of the administration. The Bush administration formed in a direct conversation with the presidential politics of the 1970s. Several members of the Bush administration came of professional age working in the Nixon and Ford administrations. They watched an assertive Congress respond to the Watergate scandal by revitalizing legislative power through the War Powers Act of 1973, the Budget Reform of 1974, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and the Independent Counsel Act in 1978. The Bush administration thought vesting Congress with so much power was dangerous, because it saw the legislative branch as inefficient. Building on efforts  since President Ronald Reagan to reverse the congressional reforms of the 1970s, the current White House spent enormous political energy, before and after 9/11, trying to reclaim power for the executive branch. The expansion of presidential power is not unique to the Bush administration. It began early in the 20th century and, despite some exceptional periods such as the 1970s, continued steadily throughout. But in several respects, this expansion was bigger in scale and scope than under previous presidents. For example, as a way to agree to legislation without agreeing to follow the intention of Congress, Bush issued statements when he signed bills -- doing so far more frequently than preceding presidents. When Congress passed a bill banning the use of torture in December 2005, Bush added a signing statement allowing him to bypass the law in his role as Commander-in-Chief. Bush also used executive orders to achieve policy objectives without obtaining congressional consent. Most of the president's national security programs were also conducted under high levels of secrecy and sometimes ignored rules such as those spelled out by FISA. Even when Republicans controlled Congress between 2002 and 2006, the president barely consulted with the leadership. After the 2000 elections, many Republican moderates were optimistic they would have more power than ever because the White House would be forced to court their vote in the evenly divided Senate. But they were wrong. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island said he was disillusioned early in the Bush administration when Cheney met with a group of Republican moderates. Cheney simply listed the bills the administration would pursue -- such as canceling U.S. support for the International Criminal Court and cutting taxes -- and informed them the president expected their vote. The chances for restoring a better balance of power remain unclear. There was a notable silence on the issue during the 2008 presidential campaign. Congressional Democrats and President-elect Barack Obama have been extremely critical of Bush's muscular approach to the executive branch. But though Obama has promised to reverse a number of executive decisions made by Bush, it is hard to tell how far he will go. Most important, it is extremely rare in the postwar period for presidents to voluntarily relinquish power. Democrats in Congress might not be willing to do to Obama what they did to Richard Nixon or even Jimmy Carter in the 1970s. After decades of Republican rule, Democrats now believe they have an opportunity to build a new majority. In addition, in a time of true crisis there will be less incentive to challenge the institutional prerogatives of their president. But Congress and the White House must do something to reverse the trends of the past eight years. We need an executive branch that is accountable and a Congress that is active. So what can be done? The first solution is informal. The White House must alter the dynamic with Congress and create strong lines of consultation with legislative leaders. President Franklin Roosevelt worked closely with legislators during the New Deal to develop economic ideas and figure out the nuts and bolts of legislation. Obama must do the same. The second solution is legislative. Congress should not be timid about passing legislation to empower the legislative branch. After The Boston Globe reported the extensive use of executive signing statements by the Bush administration, there was discussion about legislation to curtail the power, but proposals for the legislation faded away. Congress needs to consider passing measures in this and other areas, such as further defining what kinds of interrogation techniques can be used by the U.S. military and intelligence services. The final solution involves oversight. There has been a dramatic increase in congressional oversight since Democrats took control of Congress in 2006. Legislators have been more willing to hold hearings and conduct investigations into everything from the ethical conduct of the White House to the administration of key government programs. But oversight under divided government is easier politically than under the united government -- Democrats in charge of the White House and Congress -- we will have after January 20. The aim of stronger oversight is to avoid failures such as FEMA's inadequate response to Hurricane Katrina or the politicization at the Department of Justice. The fact that Democrats control the White House is no excuse for the party's leaders in Congress to become lapdogs. Obama must be held responsible as well. While presidents don't like to give up power, maybe this president will be different. At a minimum, Obama should avoid the techniques used so often in recent years to circumvent legislative will. It is not enough to reverse Bush's executive orders -- the crucial question is whether Obama uses such orders as frequently himself. If the nation can create a better balance between the executive and legislative branches, the country will benefit. The New Deal proved when both branches work together, the nation can produce some of its finest and most effective programs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Bush administration sought to rebuild presidential power .

"PANAMA CITY, Panama (CNN)  -- Ricardo Martinelli, the multimillionaire owner of a supermarket chain, was inaugurated as president of Panama on Wednesday. Ricardo Martinelli is a pro-business conservative who defeated a candidate from the ruling center-left party. National Assembly President Jose Luis Varela performed the swearing-in and placed the presidential sash on Martinelli, a pro-business conservative who defeated a candidate from the ruling center-left party in May. The citizens of Panama ""want things to be done differently,"" Varela said at the inauguration. ""An attitude of change starts today."" In his first speech as president, Martinelli promised a smaller government budget but raises for public workers. Public safety, an issue that the outgoing administration of Martin Torrijos struggled to maintain, will be a priority, Martinelli said. ""Our prisons will be rehabilitation centers, not schools for criminals,"" he said. Panama will also work with Mexico and Colombia to combat drug trafficking in the region, Martinelli said. Among the dignitaries at the inauguration was deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya, who was ousted in a military-led coup Sunday. The Organization of American States has condemned the coup, and Zelaya has continued to carry out his presidential duties. The son of Italian immigrants, Martinelli, 57, is a self-made businessman who is chairman of the Super 99 supermarket chain, one of the largest private companies in Panama. The U.S.-educated president previously served as minister and chairman of the board of directors of the Panama Canal Authority and formerly was director of social security for Panama, according to his Web site. Martinelli won the presidency with 60 percent of the votes in a race against ruling-party candidate Balbina Herrera.","NEW: Deposed Honduran president attends ceremony .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) --  Drug Enforcement Administration agents searched a Beverly Hills pharmacy Friday in connection with the investigation into the death of Michael Jackson, an agency spokesman said. Dr. Arnold Klein denied in a CNN interview last month that he had given Jackson dangerous drugs. The agents executed a federal search warrant at the Mickey Fine Pharmacy and Grill, and were expected to seize pharmacy records, said DEA spokesman Jose Martinez. The pharmacy is in the same building as the office of Jackson's dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein. Shortly before his death, Jackson visited the building several times to see Klein. The store remained open for business, giving journalists who chose to dine at its lunch counter an unusually close look at the searchers at work. Several DEA agents crowded behind the pharmacy counter, shuffling through paper documents, while pharmacy employees stood by to answer questions. Jackson had been sued by the pharmacy, which claimed the pop singer had not paid a $100,000 bill, but the dispute was later settled. On Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office visited Klein's office. ""We wanted some additional information and they provided it,"" said Ed Winter, coroner's spokesman. He said Klein's staff and attorneys cooperated with the requests. The coroner's office said more than a week ago that a ""thorough and comprehensive"" report into the death of Michael Jackson is complete, but police have requested that it not yet be released because of the ongoing criminal investigation. The coroner's office said it would abide by the request that ""the cause and manner of death remain confidential,"" and referred all questions to Los Angeles police. The DEA search did not involve detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department, although Martinez said the federal agents would share their findings with them. Jackson's June 25 death is also the focus of an investigation by Los Angeles police and the state attorney general's office. Klein, who treated Jackson for decades, denied in a CNN interview last month that he had given Jackson dangerous drugs.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Arriving at the London premiere of his self-titled mockumentary dressed in an enormous bearskin hat, cropped red army tunic and barely there hot pants, flamboyant Austrian fashionista, ""Bruno,"" paid sartorial tribute to the British as only he knows how. Bear-ing all: British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen's latest comic creation Austrian fashionista, Bruno, hits the red carpet. Waxed to perfection and flanked by a group of muscular black men dressed like a camp Queen's Guards, the gay fashion reporter flounced down the carpet to greet his public. ""Vassup CNN! Lookin' hot,"" Bruno said to CNN. ""I don't want any attention; I'm not here to promote my movie."" ""Bruno,"" which hits cinemas in most territories next month, is the latest comic creation of British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, who last shocked, insulted and delighted audiences in 2006 with Borat, Kazakhstan's ""Most Famous Broadcaster."" Bruno continues the unique approach to comedy Baron Cohen honed with characters like uneducated, loutish jungle music fan Ali G and then homophobic, anti-Semitic Kazakh journalist Borat.  Watch ""Bruno"" on the red carpet » . His specialty is characters who say the unsayable: like Bruno's carpet quip that his new film is ""the most important movie starring a gay Austrian since 'Terminator 2,'"" in joking reference to the married (and firmly heterosexual) Austrian Terminator star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, now Governor of California.  In pictures: Bruno offers fashion advice to CNN » . Baron Cohen puts his creations in real-life situations and uses them to draw unsuspecting participants into letting well-hidden prejudices slip out, engage in embarrassing behavior or contradict themselves. Characters like Bruno and Borat ""essentially work as a tool,"" Baron Cohen told UK paper The Observer in a rare out-of-character interview: ""By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice."" Baron Cohen's approach courts controversy. ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" opened to a wave of outrage from race-relations campaigners. This time it is gay-rights campaigners who are up in arms. ""Sacha Baron Cohen's well-meaning attempt at satire is problematic in many places and outright offensive in others,"" Rashad Robinson, senior director of media programs for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation told the New York Times. While some critics may suggest that his films may reinforce prejudices, others disagree. ""It is difficult to accuse Cohen of making films that are racist or homophobic,"" Aubrey Day, Editor-in-Chief of Total Film magazine told CNN. ""He takes characters and exaggerates them for broad comic value, but I don't think there's any credence in the idea that he supports any of those ideals."" But Baron Cohen certainly knows how to manipulate the media. The 37-year-old has been whipping up anticipation for ""Bruno"" with a series of attention-grabbing, hilarious stunts. In September last year, he brought chaos to the hallowed fashion shows of Milan when he stormed the catwalk of designer Agata Luiz de la Prada's show dressed in a Velcro suit with clothes from backstage stuck all over it. Most recently, he descended from the ceiling at the MTV Movie Awards wearing nothing but a pair of angel's wings and a skimpy thong before ""falling"" onto irate rapper Eminem's face. Eminem stormed out of the awards but later admitted he knew about the stunt beforehand. ""Borat"" debuted at number one in the U.S. box office and went on to gross $300 million in box office and DVD sales. Industry experts are predicting an even bigger return for ""Bruno."" The secret of the Baron Cohen comedy phenomenon may lie in his combination of laughs with something a bit deeper: namely his ability to highlight prejudices and hypocrisies. ""What he does very well is hold a mirror up to a lot of society's current ideals and expose them for what they are,"" Day told CNN. ""That is one of the joys of his films. ""You can enjoy them on a simple level, in that they are very funny, but hopefully you also come away thinking, or maybe re-thinking some of your attitudes.""","""Bruno"" paid tribute to British icons in a bearskin hat at London movie premiere .

"(CNN)  -- Authorities are asking for the public's help in finding an eighth suspect accused of being a member of a North Carolina group that allegedly plotted ""violent jihad"" overseas. Authorities are searching for North Carolina resident Jude Kenan Mohammed. ""The Raleigh Joint Terrorism Task Force is seeking any information the public may have regarding the whereabouts of Jude Kenan Mohammad,"" the FBI said in a statement. Federal authorities had said earlier that they believed Mohammad, 20, was in Pakistan. Seven other suspects are in custody. All eight are accused of plotting ""violent jihad"" overseas, according to the indictment, and are charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and conspiracy to murder, kidnap, maim and injure people. The indictment identifies Mohammad as a U.S. citizen and a North Carolina resident. It says he traveled to Pakistan in October 2008 to ""engage in violent jihad."" No further details are offered. A federal judge denied bail last week for six of the men, but expressed skepticism about the charges against them. Magistrate Judge William Webb said the defendants had made a number of statements espousing holy war, and said the statements could be interpreted in isolation as braggadocio. But because some group members had amassed a large arsenal and ammunition and had engaged in firearms training, Webb found there was reason to believe that they harbored criminal intent and presented a flight risk or a possible danger to the community. Bail was denied for the seventh man, Anes Subasic, on Monday, CNN affiliate WTVD reported. Five surreptitiously recorded audiotapes were played in a court hearing last week, along with a cell phone video showing someone firing an AK-47. On a tape made in May 2009, one of the suspects, Daniel Patrick Boyd, talks about getting the money needed to wage jihad and hitting Wells Fargo trucks and banks. He makes reference to how he had robbed a bank in Pakistan. Boyd's sons, Dylan Boyd, 22, also known as ""Mohammed,"" and Zakariya Boyd, 20, also are among the eight charged. Federal agents discovered in the Boyd house, among other items: several weapons, thousands of rounds of ammunition, $13,000 cash, gas masks, and a document described as a fatwa (Muslim religious edict) of jihad (holy war), the FBI said. They also found a trench under the deck of the house, which a witness told the FBI was a bunker to store and conceal weapons, and a plywood plank placed in a tree so that someone sitting there could see anyone approaching the house, FBI special agent Michael Sutton said. Sabrina Boyd -- the wife of Daniel Patrick Boyd and the mother of the two younger Boyds -- has said the allegations against her family are false.","Authorities looking for whereabouts of 20-year old Jude Kenan Mohammad .

"WEST POINT, Georgia (CNN) -- A community that seemed on the road to becoming a ghost town has taken a turn toward prosperity despite the recession, thanks to an automaker. A roadside sign in West Point, Georgia, expresses support for Kia's new factory. Korean car manufacturer Kia plans to open a sprawling automobile factory in tiny West Point, Georgia, by the end of the year. The boon has already spurred economic growth -- and just plain excitement -- among residents, said Mayor Drew Ferguson. ""We jokingly call it Kia-ville,"" said Ferguson, a 42-year-old dentist helping to oversee expansion of West Point, population 3,500. The announcement is drawing workers and businesses to the community about 80 miles south of Atlanta. ""The revitalization of the community is touching every aspect,"" Ferguson said. ""We have infrastructure projects, new subdivisions going up, hotel professional services that are all needed to support the massive manufacturing."" The plant, which will make Kia's Sorento sport utility vehicle, has hired 500 workers. By the time the factory opens, Kia hopes to hire 2,000 more. A smattering of Kia supply companies will eventually employ 7,500 additional workers.  Watch the town's excitement about the new factory » . ""A lot of people feel that we are the savior for this area, which I hope we will be,"" said Randy Jackson, director of human resources for the manufacturing plant. ""We got 43,013 applications; 75 percent of those applications came from Georgia, and about 20 percent came from our neighboring state of Alabama."" Some of those applications are coming from auto workers around the country, including Detroit, Michigan, Jackson said. Overall, West Point stands to gain 20,000 jobs as a result of the factory during the next five years, Ferguson said. Georgia's 9.7 percent unemployment rate reported in May is about the same as the June national average of 9.5 percent, according to federal statistics. The U.S. Department of Labor reported unemployment in a five-county region including West Point at 8.6 percent. To secure the $1.2 billion Kia plant, state and local officials helped assemble land from a former cattle farm to create a 2,200-acre industrial park. They also locked in about $400 million in tax breaks and other economic incentives. ""We think the investment will pay off big time,"" Ferguson said. ""We're already seeing it. But it's not only in the dollars, but in the hope and opportunity, and the ability to create new jobs."" Ruthann Williams invested her life savings to buy and open the Irish Bred Pub on West Point's Main Street. Now she commutes to work 45 minutes a day from her North Georgia home. ""I came here because of Kia,"" Williams said. ""We jumped in with both feet and have not looked back one time."" 'My little town was gonna die' Plans for the new factory have transformed a community that during the past ten years has been becoming a ghost town. Textile mills that once defined West Point shut down in the 1990s, leaving many out of work. Debbie Williams, co-owner of the popular Roger's Bar-B-Que, was worried her business would go under. ""We'd go downtown and there was nothing there,"" Williams said. ""I thought my little town was gonna die."" Margaret McManus was laid off last year when the textile mill she worked for closed. The 52-year-old went back to school to study information technology. In April she landed a job as a trainer with Daehan Solutions Georgia, a parts supplier for Kia. McManus said she didn't think in a million years she'd be making car parts. ""The job that I used to do for a long time, we thought we'd retire there,"" McManus said. ""It feels good to go to work everyday and have something to do."" The signs of transformation in West Point are everywhere. There's new construction, including the city's first new subdivision in 25 years. And businesses that once struggled are feeling the uptick. Williams recently replaced her restaurant floor because of all the new foot traffic. ""We see a lot of people we don't know now. They want to see where the Kia site's gonna be built,"" Williams said. ""We always say if we can get them in here one time, we can get them back, and they come. They're coming back."" Tom Oswald, owner of West Point Shoe Outlet, said last year was his best year ever. ""Once Kia announced they were opening we've sold mostly steel-toed shoes for construction workers,"" he said. ""Now we're selling wingtips for men and heels for ladies."" And Malcolm Malone, who runs M&M Car Wash, said business is booming. ""It's been up at least 70 percent,"" said the 44-year-old West Point native. ""It's like Christmas."" Or perhaps a little divine intervention deserves credit, as a West Point sign pointed out: ""Thank You Jesus For Bringing Kia to Our Town."" New flavors . On Main Street, residents are sampling new flavors that have come to West Point since the announcement. Asian restaurants and businesses are popping up. The old Pizza Hut has transformed into a Korean Bar-B-Que, and the southern staple KFC is now a popular Korean eatery called Young's Garden. Resident Christy Magbee said West Point is starting to feel like a melting pot. ""You got the culture coming in. You don't have to travel to Atlanta anymore. It's starting to come here,"" she said. ""The old downtown is new again. It's an exciting time,"" Ferguson said. ""For us there's a light at the end of the tunnel.""

"Editor's note: Rudy Ruiz founded RedBrownandBlue.com, a site featuring multicultural political commentary. He is host of a nationally syndicated Spanish-language radio show and wrote a guide to success for immigrants (""¡Adelante!"" published by Random House). He is co-founder and president of Interlex, an advocacy marketing agency based in San Antonio, Texas. Rudy Ruiz says the lives of U.S. presidents can make them positive role models for students. SAN ANTONIO, Texas (CNN) -- Perhaps we got too used to living in a nation where the president inevitably becomes persona non grata. Maybe after the Clinton and Bush years, we forgot how to give a president a chance to serve not just as a punching bag but also as a role model. Have we become so disenchanted and polarized we can't give our own president a chance to teach our children something about what it takes to succeed? As a small-town boy, I drew inspiration from presidential biographies. As I got lost in the adventures of Teddy Roosevelt, the spirit of George Washington and the ideals of Thomas Jefferson, I found kernels of America's greatness. In those pages, I unearthed a yearning to dream beyond my surroundings, to strive for more, to seek a way to contribute to our nation. Many of the leaders, including Abraham Lincoln, born in a log cabin in Kentucky, ascended from humble beginnings on the wings of education to guide America forward. Devouring their stories, it ceased to matter where I was from or how far removed I was from the centers of power. With an education and a dream -- in America -- anything was possible. Whenever President Obama addresses our youth, he embodies the power of education. Education is the cornerstone of our democracy, the key to upward mobility, a linchpin to transforming whimsical dreams into actionable goals. Ask Bill Clinton. Raised by his widowed mother in Arkansas, he became a Rhodes Scholar. Look at Barack Obama. Emerging from a broken family, he built on degrees from Columbia and Harvard in his odyssey to the White House. Remember Dwight Eisenhower. Hailing from Kansas, he attended West Point on his way to heroism. From both sides of the aisle, education has propelled the career trajectories of our nation's leaders. Even if we disagree with a president's policies, we should accept he can serve as a role model in a broader way. For example, Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. Nobody would argue this was admirable. But Jefferson was also a great thinker, diplomat and strategist. He co-authored the Declaration of Independence and helped America become a global power by engaging Europe and transacting the Louisiana Purchase. Was he perfect? Of course not. Would we want our children to emulate his every action. No way. But has he been an inspirational role model over time? As a parent, I understand people's concerns about the concepts to which their children are exposed. But the content of the president's speech to students should assuage any worries regarding his motives. Clearly, his agenda is to inspire kids to make the most of education in building a better life, not to brainwash a generation to do his bidding. Pointing to his own experiences, as well as those of others from diverse and modest origins, his remarks convey the importance of personal responsibility, perseverance and education in fulfilling one's potential while contributing to our nation's future. The only way to argue with that is by confusing the issues, twisting the situation into something it was never intended to be. It's gotten so bad, some folks don't want their kids exposed to the president because they're afraid he'll teach them socialism. My answer is that even if he did plan to discuss socialism, they should let their child listen. Of course, the president wouldn't do that, but why is that my answer? Because, as another role model -- President Reagan -- once said: ""All great change in America begins at the dinner table."" In that light, the president's speech isn't a threat but an opportunity for families to engage their children on the issues. If parents disagree with the president's views, they can sit down at the dinner table with their kids and explain their divergence. They may even find, when it comes to the value of education, President Obama might say something worth hearing. In the process, parents will teach their children: . • That we should listen respectfully to others. Doing so, we might realize that we can appreciate certain aspects of a person while disagreeing with others, and that partial differences of opinion needn't always spur absolute rejection. • That we should respect the president because, even if we didn't vote for him, we're still one nation. • That we should give our president an opportunity to lead by example. Obama's presidency is still young. We don't know what shape his legacy will take. But given his resume, regardless of politics, he's an excellent role model on the value of education. Why not give him a chance to serve in that capacity? iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Obama's speech . Just as I found inspiration in those biographies during my childhood, our youth might be moved by the president's words and stories to cherish knowledge and learning, harnessing the power of education to grow into productive, exemplary Americans in their own right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rudy Ruiz.","Rudy Ruiz: After Clinton, Bush years, presidents aren't viewed as role models .

"(CNN) -- Taliban official Hakeemullah Mehsud has been selected the new head of the Pakistani Taliban, a local Taliban commander in Pakistan's federally administered tribal areas told CNN Saturday. Baitullah Mehsud, right, former leader of the Pakistani Taliban, and a bodyguard in Pakistan, in 2004. Mehsud was selected Friday by a 42-member Taliban council, or shura, according to Taliban commander Qari Haris. Another Taliban official -- Maulvi Faqir Mohammad -- had been tapped as Mehsud's deputy, Haris said. Mohammad had named himself acting head of the Pakistani Taliban on Wednesday. A third official -- Hazem Tariq -- was named the group's new spokesman, Haris added. The announced selection underscored the contention by Pakistani and U.S. officials that the group's former leader, Baitullah Mehsud, was killed in an August 5 drone attack in Waziristan. Both Mohammad and Haris claim Mehsud is alive but ill. Pakistani officials announced Tuesday that two top figures in the Pakistani Taliban had been arrested. Saif Ullah is believed to have been Baitullah Mehsud's right-hand man, and Maulvi Umar is the well-known spokesman for the militant group. Umar recently declared that Mehsud had not been killed in a drone strike on his father-in-law's house, but a senior Pakistani official said that Umar had admitted under questioning that Mehsud was dead. The top U.S. envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, told CNN that the Pakistani Taliban had not confirmed Mehsud's death because of an ongoing power struggle over his successor. Journalists Janullah Hamizshada and Nazar ur Islam contributed to this report.","Taliban official Hakeemullah Mehsud was selected Friday by 42-member panel .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British man Gary McKinnon appeared in court Tuesday to try to prevent his extradition to the United States, where he is wanted for allegedly hacking into U.S. government computers at the Pentagon and NASA. Briton Gary McKinnon is accused of carrying out the biggest ever U.S. military hacking operation. McKinnon, who has admitted breaking the law and intentionally gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, wants to be tried in Britain rather than the United States. He is asking judges at the High Court to review a decision by the director of public prosecutions not to pursue legal action in Britain, a spokeswoman at the prosecutor's office told CNN. The prosecutor's decision effectively cleared the way for McKinnon's extradition, and McKinnon is hoping it will be overturned. It is not clear when the judges will make a decision on McKinnon's request. Prosecutors made their decision in February despite saying there was sufficient evidence to prosecute McKinnon. But they said their evidence did not reflect the level of criminality alleged by U.S. authorities, so they would allow him to be tried in America. The U.S. government says McKinnon carried out the biggest military computer hacking of all time, accessing 97 computers from his home in London for a year starting in March 2001 and costing the government about $1 million. McKinnon, currently free on bail in England, has said he was simply doing research to find out whether the U.S. government was covering up the existence of UFOs. Prosecutors in the United States and Britain disagree. ""These were not random experiments in computer hacking, but a deliberate effort to breach U.S. defense systems at a critical time which caused well-documented damage,"" Alison Saunders of the Crown Prosecution Service said in February. ""They may have been conducted from Mr. McKinnon's home computer -- and in that sense there is a UK link -- but the target and the damage were trans-Atlantic."" U.S. federal prosecutors accuse McKinnon of breaking into military, NASA and civilian networks and accessing computers at the Pentagon; Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Meade, Maryland; the Earle Naval Weapons Station in Colts Neck, New Jersey; and the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, among others. In one case, McKinnon allegedly crashed computers belonging to the Military District of Washington. McKinnon is believed to have acted alone, with no known connection to any terrorist organization, said Paul McNulty, the former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. A U.S. federal grand jury indicted McKinnon on seven counts of computer fraud and related activity. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison on each count and a $250,000 fine. McKinnon's lawyer, Karen Todner, has complained that the United States has never provided evidence to prosecutors or McKinnon's legal team to support their extradition request -- and in fact, under Britain's Extradition Act of 2003, U.S. prosecutors are not required to. McKinnon has previously said it was easy for him to access the secret files. ""I did occasionally leave messages in system administrators' machines saying, 'This is ridiculous,'"" McKinnon has said. ""(I left) some political diatribes as well, but also a pointer to say, you know, this is ridiculous."" McKinnon was on the brink of extradition in August 2008, when the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, refused to reconsider the decision to send him to the United States, effectively clearing the way for his transfer. Shortly after that decision, however, McKinnon was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, and he claims that diagnosis changed the case for extradition. It was on that basis that McKinnon made his appeals in Britain. Asperger syndrome is a form of autism that affects a person's social communication and interaction, according to Britain's National Autistic Society. Those affected often are of above-average intelligence and have fewer problems speaking than do those with autism. They sometimes have difficulty knowing when to start or end a conversation and can be very literal in what they say, with difficulty understanding jokes, metaphors and sarcasm. In addition, some people with Asperger syndrome develop an intense, sometimes obsessive interest in a hobby or subject, the National Autistic Society said. ""He says what he thinks to his own detriment,"" a friend of McKinnon's told CNN in January. He said McKinnon fears that his compulsion to say what he thinks would land him in trouble in an American prison.","Briton in court in bid to prevent extradition to U.S. for allegedly hacking computers .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Cape Verde on Friday, the final stop on her seven-nation Africa tour in which she emphasized good governance and urged officials to implement reforms. Hillary Clinton was in Cape Verde on Friday on the final leg of her Africa tour. Clinton is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Pedro Maria Neves before returning to the United States. The Obama administration describes the island nation on the western coast as an African success story. ""Cape Verde enjoys a stable democratic system, high transparency and low corruption,"" said Marianne M. Myles, the U.S. ambassador to Cape Verde. The relationship between the two countries is based on a long history of partnership, which started in 1818 when the first U.S. consulate in sub-Saharan Africa was established in the country, Myles said. Clinton's 11-day trip started in Kenya, and has included stops in South Africa, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Liberia. She arrived at Cape Verde from Liberia, where she applauded the work of pro-American president, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first woman elected head of state in Africa. ""Today, (Liberia) is a model of successful transition from conflict to post-conflict, from lawlessness to democracy, from despair to hope,"" Clinton said. ""For the last three years, the people of this country have been working to promote reform, reconstruction and reconciliation. Liberia has adopted sound fiscal policy and seen strong economic growth."" Clinton's trip comes after President Obama's visit to Ghana in July, where he urged African leaders to improve government stability. During her visit, Clinton echoed Obama's sentiment on government reform. Like Obama, Clinton made it clear that America is willing to help, but from the background. African leaders must take the lead in reforming their own countries, she said. Clinton's message was a mix of praise and criticism. She also addressed other issues including democracy, trade and sexual abuse. Hours before her arrival in Kenya, Prime Minister Raila Odinga said that Africa did not need another lecture on good governance. But Clinton said she was delivering a ""tough but lovingly presented"" message to the East African nation. ""As President Obama pointed out in his speech in Ghana, Kenya has not fulfilled its economic promise because it hasn't yet realized fully what it means to have a functioning, dynamic democracy, and a free press and an independent judiciary,"" she said. She urged Angolan officials to adopt a new constitution and hold a proper presidential election. However, she also lauded the nation's commitment to fighting HIV as the two countries signed a partnership to combat the epidemic. At a town hall meeting in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, Clinton talked about the importance of democracy and warned that though Nigeria produces 2 million barrels of oil a day, its poverty rate has gone up over the past 13 years. She blamed the lack of progress on corruption. ""The most immediate source of the disconnect between Nigeria's wealth and its poverty is a failure of governance at the local, state, and federal level,"" she said.  Watch Clinton compare election to 2000 U.S. presidential election » . During a visit to Congo, Clinton denounced sexual attacks on women and announced $17 million in funding to help fight abuse in the country. ""In the face of such evil, people of good will everywhere must respond,"" she said. ""The United States is already a leading donor to efforts aimed at addressing these problems."" Clinton also met with the leaders of Somalia's transitional government in neighboring Nairobi. The country has been waging a bloody battle against al Qaeda-linked militants with help from the United States. The State Department notes it is the earliest trip by a secretary of state and a president to Africa of any previous U.S. administration.","Secretary of State Hillary Clinton winds up 11-day Africa trip with Cape Verde visit .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Richard M. Nixon and his Brazilian counterpart, Emilio Medici, in 1971 discussed ways their countries could work together to overthrow the socialist government of Salvador Allende in Chile, according to a newly declassified document. President Richard M. Nixon, right, and his Brazilian counterpart, Emilio Medici. During a meeting of the two leaders at the White House on December 9 of that year, Medici was discussing the possibility of a coup by the Chilean military with assistance from Brazilian military officers when Nixon said that it was ""very important that Brazil and the United States work closely in this field,"" according to the document. Nixon offered money or other discreet aid for the effort if it could be made available, the document shows. ""We must try and prevent new Allendes and Castros, and try where possible to reverse these trends,"" Nixon said. Medici said he was ""happy to see that the Brazilian and American positions and views"" were so close. The declassified document, a previously top secret memorandum for Nixon's file written by National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, was published by the National Security Archive, a nongovernmental research institute in Washington. The memorandum, along with other documents, were declassified in July as part of the State Department's Foreign Relations of the United States series. ""This is an explosive document that details collusion between the colossus of the North [the United States] and the colossus of the South [Brazil],"" said Peter Kornbluh, the director of a Chile and Brazil Documentation Project for the National Security Archive. He called it ""a smoking gun of confirmation of Brazil's effort to engage in operations to overthrow the government of Chile and a discussion of collusion with the United States."" The two leaders also discussed the creation of a back channel for direct communication outside normal diplomatic protocols, according to the document. Each designated personal aides to carry handwritten communications back and forth to keep discussions out of official records. ""I think there is precedent, but we've never seen it detailed in a document this way, in which two presidents set up the utmost secret of back-channel communications so they can discuss the most sensitive aspects of collusion and collaboration in efforts to challenge the left in Latin America and change the futures of select Latin American governments,"" Kornbluh said. He added that ""there's a significant paper trail of evidence of what that collusion was that remains secret, and we're going to have to press Brazil and Washington to recover those documents."" Despite the leaders' effort to keep the subject of their talks secret, word got out. A declassified CIA memorandum written some time after the Nixon-Medici meeting in Washington said that word of the secret talks between the two leaders about shaping Brazilian foreign policy filtered down to Brazilian military officers by a ""Cabinet leak."" Gen. Vicente Dale Coutinho, commander of Brazil's 4th Army, reacted to this by saying that the United States obviously wanted Brazil ""to do the dirty work,"" it said. A declassified CIA national intelligence estimate written in 1972 concluded, ""Brazil will be playing a bigger role in hemispheric affairs and seeking to fill whatever vacuum the U.S. leaves behind. It is unlikely that Brazil will intervene openly in its neighbors' internal affairs, but the regime will not be above using the threat of intervention or tools of diplomacy and covert action to oppose leftist regimes, to keep friendly governments in office, or to help place them there."" The newly published documents do not offer any conclusive proof of Brazilian involvement in the Chilean coup of 1973, which the Nixon administration supported. Kornbluh said that with the passage of time and change in governments in all of the countries involved, the real story of diplomatic and covert collusion between the United States and Brazil in Chile can finally be told. The National Security Archive will push for the declassification and publication of more top-secret documents from the Nixon library, he said, and will approach Brazilian government officials to ask for their cooperation in getting documents released in Washington and Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. Kornbluh said he also hopes that surviving Chilean government and military officers from the era who knew of any arrangements with the Brazilian government will come forward and tell their stories. ""This is history for history's sake, but history will not find closure until it's fully aired,"" he said.","Document shows Richard M. Nixon, Emilio Medici had like-minded goals .

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- An undersea cable plugging east Africa into high speed Internet access went live Thursday, providing an alternative to expensive satellite connections. The cable links southern Africa to Europe and Asia. SEACOM, the cable provider company, opened its 17,000 kilometer submarine cable, capable of 1.28 terabytes per second, allowing the region true connectivity. Most Africans rely on expensive and slow satellite connections, which make the use of applications such as YouTube and Facebook extremely trying. ""This is going to reduce the cost of doing business in Africa, within Africa and with international parties"" said Suveer Ramdhani, SEACOM spokesman in South Africa. ""The cable is as thin as a hair strand, and in one second it can download the same amount of data that 160 people use in a month."" SEACOM, privately funded and 75 percent African owned, will provide retail carriers with open source access to inexpensive bandwidth. It has taken less than three years to complete the mammoth project, providing landing stations at South Africa, Kenya, Madagascar and other points along the east coast of Africa. But telecoms analyst James Hodge said that some of the more ambitious hopes for the system -- such as impacting the continent's socioeconomic problems -- will be long-term, and that initially it will be those already connected who will see the benefits. The launch was delayed by a month because of increased activity by pirates along parts of the African coast. Security teams were beefed up to protect the slow moving cable layers. Neotel, a South African communications network operator, is the largest SEACOM customer in South Africa and is the country's landing partner, providing both the coastal landing station and Johannesburg data center for the submarine cable. Neotel managing director Ajay Pandey is excited about the opportunities for growth presented by the SEACOM cable. ""With this cable coming in, the pipe size opens up, so more and more people are able to get faster and better connectivity, hopefully at a lower price. It can't be more expensive than what it is today."" SEACOM Chief Executive Officer Brian Herlihy added: ""Turning the switch 'on' creates a huge anticipation, but ultimately, SEACOM will be judged on the changes that take place on the continent over the coming years."" South Africa has been hobbled by high costs and extremely slow bandwidth, effectively keeping the country on an information back road rather then the superhighway. There is much anticipation and hope that the cable will ensure Africa keeps up with the developed world in Internet connectivity, providing greater speed, flexibility and, potentially, a complete socioeconomic transformation. Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete said in his opening address: ""It's the ultimate embodiment of modernity."" His speech was beamed via SEACOM from a launch in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to the simultaneous launch in Johannesburg, South Africa.","Undersea SEACOM cable links southern and east Africa to Europe, Asia .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Demand for the world's largest, most expensive yachts is on the rise ahead of the Monaco Yacht Show this week. Ships moored at the Moncao Yacht Show. ""We've gotten the strongest forward order book that we've ever had. It's the best outlook we've ever had since we've started the company,"" said Toby Allies, Sales and Marketing Director for Pendennis, a leading British manufacturer and re-fitter of superyachts. Amid the global recession, the worldwide market for luxury goods has plummeted over the last year, expected to shrink 10 percent for 2009 according to global business consultants Bain & Company. A few sectors, though, have shown surprising strength and even growth amid the downturn, including British-made superyachts. The British market for superyachts grew more than 15 percent during the fiscal year ending June 1, 2009, according to a new survey. Overall revenue increased to a record $663 million (£410 million) and jobs across the industry increased five percent, according to Superyacht UK, the trade group who conducted the survey. Since last September, yacht sales tanked in many parts of the world, particularly as cash dried up among clients from Russia and the Middle East. ""It was a difficult year, many manufacturers had to cut down on production numbers and give larger discounts,"" said Georges Tchoumak, Head of Sales and Marketing for Numarine, a manufacturer of superyachts based in Turkey. In France three of the four publicly-traded yacht companies who make yachts that cost more than $40 million took advantage of the country's bankruptcy laws to stave off collapse, including Rodriguez Group, the company who built Bernard Madoff's yacht ""Bull."" Though affected by the recession, the UK industry managed to buck that trend, buoyed by a decline in the pound. ""In the last quarter of 2008 through the end of first quarter 2009 there was virtually zero activity in the large yacht sector,"" said Tim Wiltshire, Director of Burgess Yachts, a UK-based high-end boat manufacturer. Wiltshire said that at their worst, transactions were down 60 percent compared with the previous year, but that volume had recently returned, particularly in brokerage sales of used yachts. Heading into Monaco, manufacturers around the world including the UK now appear poised for a robust rebound. ""There have been a dozen significant sales in the past quarter ... enough of our customers think it's unlikely to get much worse."" But whiles sales have picked up, Wiltshire predicted it could take years for sale prices to reach the premiums of only a few years ago: ""Since early summer [business] has picked up significantly ... We are back on par with 2007, albeit at reduced values,"" he said. Manufacturers across the UK share Wiltshire's optimism, according to the survey. Ninety-five percent of UK companies questioned rated their prospects for the year ahead either ""good or excellent"" (56 percent) or ""OK"" (39 percent). At Numarine ""things are looking better for the last three months,"" Tchomak told CNN. ""We've had more sales in the past three months than in the previous 12 months,"" he wrote in an email. At Pendennis, directors have changed their business strategy to accommodate the anticipated growth. ""We've increased our investment in infrastructure for large yachts,"" said Ailes. ""Improving facilities and looking to recruit more people to work on boats up to 70 or 80 meters."" One of the reasons cited for the strength in Britain's superyacht business compared with manufacturers in other European countries has been the declining value of Sterling against the Euro. Hugo Andreae, Editor-in-Chief of Superyachtworld magazine said that the exchange rate helped, but the high quality of British boats and sustained demand among the world's wealthiest had helped hold up sales. Andreae also explained that one of the effects of the recession has been to shift demand from new builds to the used boat brokerage and chartering markets. ""There are signs that things are picking up ... Monaco is the premiere big yacht show and it's the real acid test of whether [the rebound] is the odd sale being picked up at a good price, or if the market has reignited properly,"" explained Tom Chant, International Commercial Manager for Superyacht UK. If interest in the Monaco Yacht Show is any indicator, then sales can be expected to meet bullish expectations. The annual end-of-summer yachting industry and yacht owners' conference is fully booked this week. The number of double-decker pavilions has doubled since last year, but in spite of the event's increased provision of these more expensive, higher visibility exhibition spaces supply still fell short of demand. In the United States yacht manufacturers also say they've seen a recent surge in interest in new construction of yachts over 150 feet. ""Over the last 45 days, all of a sudden, the inquires have started coming along really strong. That bodes well for the Monaco Yacht Show,"" said William Smith, V.P. of Sales and Marketing for Trinity Yachts. ""It's fair to say sales came to a shuddering halt after the Monaco show last year."" In another sign that interest in the top-end of the yacht market is back, Luxury retailer Hermes recently announced plans to team up with Wally, the Monaco superyacht company, to build a $145 million (€100 million) yacht. Sales to Russia, the Middle East and other developing countries have rebounded more quickly than sales to Europe and the U.S., according to Smith, as uncertainty about the markets has subsided and boosted consumer confidence. In the past six months, Trinity had only had one inquiry from an American, which came in the last few weeks. Trinity, the largest U.S. retailer of megayachts, has had two projects out of 17 builds stall due to the recession, both about 164 feet long. Smith said the owners can either come back and pay for them to finish the work or let Trinity sell them. Throughout the downturn Trinity was able to continue to deliver ships at a record pace, thanks to a hearty backlog of orders placed during the markets peaks.","The British market for superyachts grew more than 15 percent last year .

Officers from departments in several cities, including Cleveland, Ohio; Miami Metro Dade, Florida; Baltimore, Maryland; and Chicago, Illinois, were sworn in as part of the massive security effort, but Tucson wins the prize for the greatest distance traveled.  Watch how Pittsburgh has prepared for protests » . ""There's a standardization in training,"" Tucson Lt. Paul Sayre said. Departments brought in to assist have undergone similar preparations in techniques and crowd control. The Arizona officers were asked to come to Pittsburgh after taking part in the protection effort at the Republican National Convention in 2008 in St. Paul, Minnesota. The downtown Pittsburgh street on a morning with temperatures in the 50s was nothing like a typical day for the officers. ""It's a different environment,"" Sayre said -- but the job was the same. ""We're excited to be here. It's a lot of fun."" ""Our role is to support Pittsburgh,"" said Capt. Perry Tarrant, commanding the Tucson team. The additional help protecting downtown locations ""gives Pittsburgh the flexibility to send its officers where needed,"" Sayre said.","Police officers from around country join G-20 security effort in Pittsburgh .

"(CNN) -- Schools of robotic fish could one day map the ocean floor, detect pollution or inspect and survey submerged boats or oil and gas pipelines, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology say. MIT researcher Pablo Valdivia Alvarado works in his lab on a robotic fish he co-created. MIT engineers are showing off the latest generation of so-called robofish 15 years after they built the first one. The latest incarnation is sleeker, more streamlined and capable of mimicking the movements of a real fish. And it's capable of exploring underwater terrain submersibles can't, said Pablo Valdivia Alvarado, a mechanical engineer at the school. ""Some of our sponsors were thinking of using them for inspection and surveillance,"" Alvarado said. ""Since these prototypes are very cheap, the idea was to build hundreds -- 200, 500 -- and then just release them in a bay or at a port, and they would be roaming around taking measurements."" MIT researchers built their first robotic fish, ""Robotuna,"" in 1994. But Robotuna has gone the way of the dinosaur. Alvarado said the new generation -- modeled after bass and trout -- cost only a few hundred dollars and have only 10 parts instead of the thousands used in Robotuna. At five to 18 inches, the new fish is much smaller than Robotuna and built from a single, soft polymer. And unlike Robotuna, the fish is able to be released in the oceans. ""Most of the brains, the electronics, are embedded inside,"" said Alvarado, who designed the robofish with fellow MIT engineer Kamal Youcef-Toumi. ""We have built prototypes with the battery inside, but for my experiments, for simplicity. We have a lot of prototypes that are simply tethered. We have a cable that runs out from the body and connects to a power supply."" The new generation has withstood harsh conditions in the lab, including two years of testing inside tanks filled with tap water, which is corrosive to standard robots, according to Alvarado, who says the Robotuna inspired him to take the technology to the next level. The oil exploration company Schlumberger helped fund the research, but Alvarado says the U.S. Navy has also expressed interest in the robofish. MIT's mechanical engineers are now turning their attention to new challenges: A robotic manta ray and a terrestrial robot in the form of a salamander. CNN's Ninette Sosa contributed to this report.","Engineers at MIT have created a new generation of robotic fish .

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Abayte Ahmed and her husband learned of their son's death in the most heinous fashion. A family acquaintance called and told them to click on an Internet site. There on the screen were photographs of their 20-year-old son -- the boy with the movie-star looks -- shot through the head thousands of miles away in Somalia. Jamal Bana died in Somalia. Several missing Somali-Americans are believed to have fought there. ""He must have been somewhat disillusioned and indoctrinated, because he didn't have any clue about Somalia at all,"" his mother said, fighting back tears and barely able to speak about her eldest son. Jamal Bana had been missing for months from his Minneapolis home. His family is still grappling with the circumstances surrounding his death in a land they had fled -- an African nation wracked by chaos and violence. The FBI said Bana's death is part of a sweeping federal investigation into a recruiting effort in the United States by a Somali terrorist group called Al-Shabaab, which has ties to al Qaeda. More than a dozen young men of Somali descent have disappeared from the Minneapolis area in recent months. At least three, including Bana, have ended up dead in Somalia, community leaders say.  Watch the harrowing saga of Jamal Bana » . Bana was the kind of son a modest immigrant family pins its hopes on. He was the eldest of seven and studying engineering at local colleges. But last fall, his family said, he disappeared without any warning. A few days later, the phone rang. All that could be heard was a quick sentence. ""I'm in Somalia,"" his mother quoted him as saying. He then hung up. Communication from then on was scarce. In calls or text messages, the family said, Bana was guarded, as though someone was watching or listening to him. On July 11, the family received the call telling them to look on the Internet. Bana's father broke down in tears when he saw the photos. One image was a close-up of his son's face, a bullet wound on one side of his head. Another showed the body being carried through the streets of Mogadishu on a stretcher. His parents said they believe their son was brainwashed and recruited to fight in the civil war between Somalia's unstable transitional government and Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab remains entrenched in northeast Somalia and in sections south of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, after fighting that has uprooted more than 200,000 people since early May, according to the United Nations. The question immigrants in the United States want answered is: How have their youth ended up so far away? One of the missing youth, Shirwa Ahmed, 27, blew up himself and 29 others last fall in Somalia in what is believed to be the first suicide bombing carried out by a naturalized U.S. citizen. Ahmed had traveled from Minneapolis. The attack raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community and sparked an investigation by the FBI. Just weeks ago, community activist Abdirizak Bihi lost his 17-year-old nephew, Burhan Hassan, in Somalia. Asked if his nephew had been kidnapped from Minneapolis, Bihi said, ""They kidnap them in the sense of mental kidnapping, not physically. But they play a male role of mentor."" Bihi and community leader Omar Jamal said they hold one place at least loosely responsible: the Abubakar as-Saddique Islamic Center, the largest mosque in Minneapolis. ""All these kids missing, they all have one thing in common: They all participated in youth programs in that mosque,"" said Jamal. Jamal and Bihi said leaders of the mosque, at the very least, allowed people to come around their facility and recruit young men to fight in Somalia -- a charge the head imam denies. CNN was not allowed inside the mosque, but was granted an interview with the imam at a different location. ""This is the baseless accusation really,"" said Sheikh Abdirahman Sheikh Omar Ahmed. ""The mosque -- the mission of the mosque -- is to worship. And people come to worship and go. We don't have any control over what comes through everybody's mind or ideology."" Sheikh Ahmed said at least two of the young men who died in Somalia did worship at his mosque. But he said no recruiters came around the mosque to pull them away, and said his mosque does not support Al-Shabaab. He added that he has encouraged local families to keep their young sons from going to Somalia. Federal authorities recently made their first arrests in the case, charging two Minnesota men, Salah Osman Ahmed and Abdifatah Yusuf Isse, with one count each of providing material support to terrorists and conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure people overseas, according to the indictment. CNN could not reach Salah Osman Ahmed's attorney for comment. Published reports indicate he planned to plead not guilty. Isse has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with federal authorities, officials said. In court papers obtained by CNN, Isse's attorney said, ""Mr. Isse will not be the last defendant indicted."" A local attorney involved in the case said at least seven Somali-Americans have been questioned by a grand jury. An FBI official said the bureau cannot rule out the possibility that some of the young men involved could be trained to carry out terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Meanwhile, CNN has learned more about how Shirwa Ahmed and Burhan Hassan made their way overseas. A travel agent in Minneapolis, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the two men paid about $1,800 in cash for tickets to Nairobi, Kenya, or to Dubai, U.A.E. The travel agent said he thinks the two men then made their way to Mogadishu from those cities on a Somali carrier. For Bana's family, it's all too much to bear. Omar Boley is a close friend who grew up in the same tribe as Bana's family. He said Bana's mother is having difficulty coping with everything that has happened in recent months. ""She doesn't want to hear the story again,"" he said. ""She told me, 'Whenever I see someone talking about my son, I feel bad. I can't sleep. I feel sick. So this happened, nothing I can do. We pray for him.' That's what she said, and that's what I believe.""","Jamal Bana had been missing for months; family learns of his death via Internet .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A top Baha'i official has criticized Iran's claim that the six imprisoned leaders of the religious minority were held for security reasons and not because of their faith. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government has been accused of trying to eliminate the Baha'i community. Bani Dugal, the principal representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations, called Iran's assertion ""utterly baseless."" ""The allegations are not new, and the Iranian government knows well that they are untrue,"" Dugal said on Wednesday, quoted in a news release issued by the Baha'i movement. ""The documented plan of the Iranian government has always been to destroy the Baha'i community, and these latest arrests represent an intensification of this plan."" Iranian government spokesman Gholam-Hossein Elham said the people were detained for ""security issues"" and not their faith, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said. Elham said on Tuesday that the Baha'is were members of a group working together ""against national interest."" ""The group is an organized establishment linked to foreigners, the Zionists in particular,"" he said. The arrests of the six last week and another Baha'i leader in March sparked sharp condemnation by the Baha'is, the United States, Canada, the European Union and humanitarian groups. The Baha'is say the latest arrests are part of a pattern of religious persecution since 1979, when the monarchy of the Shah of Iran was toppled and an Islamic republic was created in the predominantly Shiite nation. The Baha'is say they have been killed, jailed and ""otherwise oppressed"" only because of their religion. ""The best proof of this is the fact that, time and again, Baha'is have been offered their freedom if they recant their Baha'i beliefs and convert to Islam, an option few have taken,"" Dugal said. Dugal said Iran's practice of connecting the group to Zionism, the underlying political philosophy of the Jewish state, was a ""distortion"" and an attempt to ""stir animosity"" among the Iranian public. The Baha'i World Center, which the movement refers to as its ""spiritual and administrative heart,"" is in the Acre/Haifa area in northern Israel -- a location that predates the founding of the state of Israel since it was formed during the Ottoman Empire's rule of Palestine. The Baha'is explain that their founder, Baha'u'llah, ""after a series of successive banishments from his native Persia, was exiled, with members of his family and a small band of his followers, to the Turkish penal colony of Acre in 1868."" Dugal said the Iranian actions were the ""most recent iteration in a long history of attempts to foment hatred by casting the Baha'is as agents of foreign powers, whether of Russia, the United Kingdom, or the United States and now Israel all of which are completely baseless."" Dugal said the government's philosophies are based largely on the idea that there can be ""no prophet following Mohammed"" and that the faith ""poses a theological challenge to this belief."" They say Baha'u'llah is regarded by Baha'is as ""the most recent in the line of Messengers of God that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, Christ and Mohammed."" The Baha'is-- regarded as the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran -- say they have 5 million members across the globe, and about 300,000 in Iran.","Baha'i official denies Iran claim that six of its leaders held for security reasons .

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- U.S. officials urged American citizens in Germany to keep a low profile and remain wary of their surroundings after the terrorist organization al Qaeda posted a video message threatening attacks in the country. German special police patrol in Berlin last month during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu. A State Department travel alert, issued Wednesday, remains in effect until November 11 -- two weeks after Germany holds its federal elections on Sunday. Al Qaeda posted its video threat on the Internet on September 18, vowing attacks if the elections do not come out the way it wants. The same day, the German government reacted to the video by raising its own alert level and heightening security. The British Foreign Office has also issued an advisory to its citizens living and traveling to Germany. The State Department travel alert asks Americans to keep abreast of news reports and consider the security procedures in place when they visit public places or pick hotels and restaurants. Germany's interior ministry said earlier this month that the country has noted an increase in threats by al Qaeda and other Islamist groups since the beginning of the year. In the nearly 26-minute video statement, a man identified as Bekay Harrach, using the pseudonym Abu Talha and speaking in German, said that, if the September 27 elections vote into power parties that do not pledge to pull German troops from Afghanistan, there will be a ""rude awakening."" The speaker called on Muslims living in Germany to stay away from public life during the first two weeks after the elections, implying that any attacks would take place then. The speaker repeatedly criticized German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also criticized Merkel's rivals, the Social Democrats, but offered the possibility of a ""peace offer."" ""If the German people vote for peace, then the Mujahedeen will choose peace with Germany as well,"" he said. ""And with the withdrawal of the last German soldier from Afghanistan, the last Mujahed will also leave Germany. Al Qaeda gives you their word.""","Al Qaeda terror group posts video message threatening attacks in Germany .

"Editor's note: Myron Lowery is mayor of Memphis, Tennessee. Memphis Mayor Myron Lowery fist bumps the Dalai Lama on his arrival in the Tennessee city. MEMPHIS, Tennessee (CNN) -- ""Hello Dalai, . Well, hello ... Dalai!"" It seemed like a good idea at the time. And with hindsight being 20/20; it still does. How often do you get to meet an international figure as captivating as the Dalai Lama? I wanted to make an impression, and break the ice, in my Southern hospitality sort of way. So enter the lyric from the song and the fist bump now heard round the world. I had been told by his representatives that the Dalai Lama had a wonderful sense of humor, and would enjoy the exchange. Indeed, he did. His Holiness laughed, returned the gesture, and gave me his blessings. And in our brief time together, I saw in his eyes the sparkle of kindness, love and good humor. It's unfortunate that not everyone could allow themselves to enjoy the moment, as we did. Barely an hour passed before reporters began calling to say my fist bump with the Dalai Lama was ""disrespectful,"" unusual and perhaps inappropriate. Why would I do that, they asked? Well to answer that, I would have to go back a couple of weeks or so. One of my assistants in the mayor's office began feeling ill. After a couple of days off work, she was diagnosed with the H1N1 flu. She sits 10 feet away from me. The swine flu story was hitting close to home in a major way. As the leader of a major city, I had to step forward and deal with fears about a virus that has never been known to man.  Watch the Dalai Lama's fist bump » . So I rolled up my sleeves and took a shot for the seasonal flu. I encouraged everyone to get the H1N1 vaccine as soon as it becomes available. I urged people to cough politely into a napkin or their sleeve. I had hand sanitizer installed in the common areas at city hall. I greeted the Chairman of the City Council with a fist bump and it made the local news. It became a running theme in City Hall. The mayor would greet you with a fist bump. A day before His Holiness came to the city, I spoke to the Dalai Lama's protocol team and they said he would not be upset or offended being greeted this way. In fact it has happened in the past. So, armed with this information I decided to greet him when he arrived Tuesday in a similar fashion. Not because of any concern about H1N1. I greeted him this way because I'm a down to earth guy, who was raised by a single mother with four sons in public housing. I still tell everyone to call me Myron. I am now living a dream as the mayor of Memphis. And Wednesday, as I sat and watched His Holiness accept an award from the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, the gravity of the moment was in no way lost on me. An international crusader for peace was here on the hallowed ground where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. took his last breath. He offered his blessings, walked into the crowd, touched people. He carried himself humbly, not as one to be feared, but as a man, sharing his humanity, making us all better for it. So in the final analysis, I know His Holiness is always happy to participate in local customs, however obscure. He is about peace and harmony, and a fist bump is just another expression of warm friendship that he again returned to me before he left. And the ""Hello, Dalai?"" Well, that was just a bonus. He knew it was coming and we all laughed together. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Myron Lowery.","Myron Lowery: I greeted the Dalai Lama with a fist bump and a pun .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- The number of people killed in a car bombing in Afghanistan's capital rose to 26, including six Italian soldiers, Afghan authorities said Saturday. The coffins of six Italian soldiers killed in a suicide attack in Kabul return to Rome. Sixteen people died in the blast Thursday, and at least 55 Afghan civilians were wounded. Ten have died from their injuries since the bombing. The explosion Thursday targeted a mostly residential area near the Supreme Court in Kabul, a witness said. The bodies of the Italian soldiers killed in the blast returned to Italy Sunday, their coffins draped in the red, green and white Italian flag. Dignitaries, relatives and row upon row of uniformed troops stood on the airport tarmac as the coffins were carried off the plane, television pictures from the scene showed.

A day of mourning is scheduled in Italy on Monday, the same day as the burial service. After the attack, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said it would be ""best"" for the country's troops to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible. Berlusconi gave no timeline for a withdrawal, but said any pullout would have to be coordinated with allies. The 500 troops Italy sent to Afghanistan this summer will be home by Christmas, Ignazio La Russa, Italy's defense minister said. The troops were sent ahead of the Afghan presidential election August 20.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson feared his father so much he would faint or vomit sometimes when his father entered the room -- even when the pop singer was an adult, according to a book written by a former Jackson confidant. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, Michael Jackson's confidant, sat down with the King of Pop and taped 30 hours of interviews. ""The Michael Jackson Tapes"" includes Jackson talking about his fear of growing old, his relationship with children, his friendships with Madonna and Brooke Shields, and his remarkable shyness around people that made his surround himself with mannequins. Jackson opened up to Rabbi Shmuley Boteach for 30 hours of interviews, which were taped nine years ago and intended for a book Jackson wanted written, Boteach said. ""He was trying to reclaim his life,"" Boteach said Friday in an NBC ""Today Show"" interview. Jackson, who died on June 25 of what the coroner found to be a deadly combination of drugs, ""lost the will to live, I think he was just going through the motions of life toward the end,"" Boteach told NBC. CNN has not independently confirmed Jackson's quotes in the book, but Boteach was known to be a spiritual adviser to Jackson for several years beginning about 1999. Ken Sunshine, spokesman for the family, including the singer's father, Joe, issued a statement on the book. ""We are not going to dignify this with a comment,"" he said. The book was not published during Jackson's lifetime because of the pop star's child molestation trial, which ended with an acquittal in 2005, the author said. The author said Jackson's arrest ended any interest in a book about him. ""I don't want to grow old,"" Jackson is quoted as saying in one interview with Boteach. ""When the body breaks down and you start to wrinkle, I think it's so bad,"" Jackson said. Jackson talked to Boteach about why he was drawn to children, especially those who were sick. ""I love them. I love them,"" he said. Helping children enjoy their childhood is his mission, Jackson said. ""I feel that this is something really, really in my heart that I am supposed to do, and I feel so loved by giving my love, and I know that's what they need,"" he said. Jackson said that while adults ""appreciate me artistically as a singer and a songwriter and a dancer and a performer,"" children ""just want to have some fun and to give love and have love and they just want to be loved and held."" Boteach, in an interview about two years before Jackson's November 2003 arrest, asked Jackson about the young cancer patient who would later become his main accuser. ""He's special,"" Jackson said. Boteach asked Jackson whether by speaking to people like the boy ""part of the pain goes away for them."" ""Absolutely,"" Jackson said. ""Because every time I talk to him he is in better spirits. When I spoke to him last night he said, 'I need you. When are you coming home?' I said, 'I don't know.' He said, 'I need you, Michael.' Then he calls me 'Dad.'"" Michael Jackson's taped statements about his father's treatment of him as a child echoed what he has said previously. ""He was rough, the way he would beat you, you know, was hard,"" Jackson said. ""He would make you strip nude first. He would oil you down. It would be a whole ritual. He would oil you down so when the flip of an ironing cord hit you, you know, and, it was just like me dying, and you had whips all over your face, your back, everywhere. And I always hear my mother like, 'No, Joe, you're gonna kill him. You're gonna kill him. No.' And I would just give up, like there was nothing I could do. And I hated him for it. Hated him."" Joe Jackson has denied physically abusing his son. ""Now, Michael was never beaten by me, I've never beaten at all,"" he told CNN's Larry King in July. He did suggest he used spankings for disciplining his children. Another Michael Jackson quote from the book alleged emotional abuse by Joe Jackson: . ""God bless my father because he did some wonderful things and he was brilliant, he was a genius, but one day he said, 'If you guys ever stop singing I will drop you like a hot potato.' It hurt me. You would think he would think, 'These kids have a heart and feelings.' Wouldn't he think that would hurt us? If I said something like that to Prince and Paris, that would hurt. You don't say something like that to children and I never forgot it. It affects my relationship with him today."" Jackson told Boteach he was still ""scared of my father to this day."" ""My father walked in the room -- and God knows I am telling the truth -- I have fainted in his presence many times. I have fainted once to be honest. I have thrown up in his presence because when he comes in the room and this aura comes and my stomach starts hurting and I know I am in trouble. He is so different now. Time and age has changed him and he sees his grandchildren and he wants to be a better father. It is almost like the ship has sailed its course, and it is so hard for me to accept this other guy that is not the guy I was raised with. I just wished he had learned that earlier."" In the excerpts provided to CNN by the book's publisher, there were no quotes from Jackson discussing his drug use, but Boteach does write about what he saw during the several years he was Jackson's spiritual adviser, starting in 1999. While Boteach said he never personally saw Jackson use drugs, he did suspect it. ""In the time that I knew him, he always seemed intent on me having a positive view of him and nothing untoward was ever done in my presence,"" he wrote. While their close relationship ended around the time of the molestation charges, Boteach said Jackson's parents reached out to him later for help in convincing him to enter drug rehab. ""Perhaps I could inspire Michael to make that decision, and his parents thought I could at least help,"" Boteach said. ""But I knew they were wrong. Michael had long since ceased taking my counsel. He found my advice too demanding. I was an irritant and was treated as such."" He said he told Joe and Katherine Jackson that ""it was imperative for them to save their son's life by becoming available parents in his greatest hour of need."" Sometimes those closest to Jackson were not people -- but mannequins, the book said. Jackson said he was so shy at times he surrounded himself with dummies. ""Because I felt I needed people, someone, and I didn't have,"" he said. ""I was too shy to be around real people."" Boteach, in the NBC interview Friday, said it made his skin crawl to hear that. ""His celebrity had created a degree of isolation where he could not simply feel comfortable around other people,"" Boteach said. ""He thought that everybody wanted something from him. He felt that he was trapped in this cocoon of fame and that there was some exploitative relationship with virtually everyone that he met."" The book does offer insight into Jackson's dating of celebrity women, including actress Brooke Shields. ""That was one of the loves of my life,"" Jackson said. ""I just wished she loved me as much as I loved her, you know."" He told Boteach one problem he had with women was their jealousy of his fame. ""They admire you and know you're wonderful and great, but just they're jealous because they wish they were in your place, with they were in your shoes. And 'M' is one of them -- Madonna. Hate to say that on tape."" CNN asked Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg for a response: . ""Madonna was very fond of Michael Jackson (as she clearly expressed in her tribute to him at the VMA's) and I doubt anything in the book will change her mind,"" Rosenberg said. CNN's Marc Balinsky contributed to this report.","Former confidant's book based on 30 hours of interviews with Michael Jackson .

"(CNN) -- For Dr. Lisa Newman, a 16-hour trip over two days from Michigan to Ghana in Africa is just part of the journey in uncovering clues about a rare form of breast cancer. Dr. Lisa Newman hopes to uncover clues in Ghana about an aggressive and rare form of breast cancer. Newman, a surgical oncologist specializing in breast cancer at the University of Michigan, collaborates with doctors in Kumasi, Ghana, in hopes of discovering the origins of an aggressive and difficult to treat form of breast cancer that disproportionately affects black women. It is called triple negative breast cancer or TNBC. ""The women that are most likely to be afflicted with the triple negative breast cancers are younger aged women, women in the pre-menopausal age range, and women with African ancestry,"" says Newman. According to the American Cancer Society, 192,370 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the United States in 2009. Triple negative breast cancer represents approximately 15 percent of breast cancer cases in the United States. As an African-American female surgeon, Lisa Newman is a rarity in the United States. African-Americans make up less than 5 percent of physicians in this country, according to the American Medical Association. Newman, who is also the director of the Breast Care Center for the University of Michigan, recalls her early days during the '90's as a general surgeon in Brooklyn, New York. ""It was just heartbreaking every day in the clinic to continuously be seeing African-American women that seemed to be disproportionately afflicted with breast cancers at younger ages, and more advanced stages of disease."" Little is known about what causes TNBC. But statistics show that black women are twice as likely as white women to get it. When diagnosing breast cancer, doctors look for three markers: estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and the HER2/neu receptor. These markers show where the cancer is most vulnerable and help determine how best to treat it. The most successful treatments for breast cancer are drugs that specifically target these markers.  Doctor travels to Ghana for cancer clues » . However, triple negative breast cancer is negative for all three markers, hence the name, making it very difficult to treat and more likely to recur. With the devastating statistics and grim reality of this disease, Newman began her journey about five years ago to learn more about it. Triple negative breast cancer survivor finds life's purpose . ""We are very interested in looking at whether or not African ancestry in and of itself might actually predispose women to a biologically more aggressive form of breast cancer, such as the triple negative breast cancer."" Sixty percent of Ghanaian women who have breast cancer have triple negative breast cancer, according to Newman. ""Western sub-Saharan Africa is an important geographic location to focus on because that's where many of the slave colonies were located several hundred years ago,"" says Newman. To test her theory, Newman sets off for Ghana. Three flights and two days later, she arrives at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in the city of Kumasi. Newman is convinced there's a profound link between Ghanaian women and African-American women afflicted with TNBC. She hopes her trips each year to the African country could lead to clues about the origins of TNBC or perhaps pave the way to finding a cure. On each trip Newman gathers genetic evidence and tissue samples for her study. But she also believes there's a cultural and educational benefit for herself and her colleagues through this exchange. ""We bring medical students and trainees with us to Ghana and they get to see what the health care system is like in a medically underserved part of the world,"" she says. ""And our colleagues from Ghana have opportunities to visit with us at the University of Michigan, and to learn more about westernized practices in terms of multidisciplinary care of breast cancer patients. So, it allows trainees and cancer specialists on both sides of the ocean to learn more about each other and about what's available in different parts of the world."" Working with her Ghanaian colleagues, Newman sees a wide range of patients. Some women need biopsies on undiagnosed breast abnormalities, while others have diagnosed tumors that have gone untreated for some time. In addition, Newman and her Ghanaian counterparts discuss the day's cases, a critical step to establishing individualized courses of treatment.  Dr. Newman has her own scare with breast cancer » . ""It's heartbreaking that we see many advanced stage of cancers in the women of Ghana, but it's a tremendous opportunity to make a difference and to be able to share what we have in the United States with the women here, with our family, our extended family,"" says Newman. Back in the United States, Newman gathers samples at a local Detroit, Michigan, hospital and at events held by the Sisters Network, an organization for black breast cancer survivors. She runs DNA comparisons to the samples gathered in Ghana and one day hopes to correlate African ancestry with the risk of being diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in African-Americans. If this happens, according to Newman, it will open doors to new treatments.","Dr. Lisa Newman travels 16 hours from Michigan to Ghana in search of cancer clues .

"(CNN) -- Sodden and crumbling, the Pin Oak levee was the only thing standing between Winfield, Missouri, and the flood-swollen Mississippi River on Wednesday. James Burt sits on an embankment near a neighborhood inundated with floodwaters in Winfield, Missouri. ""The currents are already doing enough to our levees, but a 2-inch wake can cause an entire levee to break,"" said Andy Binder, public information officer for Lincoln County Emergency Operations Command. ""Right now, we are using the Missouri State Water Patrol to keep people from using their boats around the levees."" On Tuesday, the 2½-mile levee was hit by a ""down slide"" along a 160-foot section of its northern wall. The Army Corps of Engineers rushed in with sandbags and extra dirt for the base to keep the soil from slipping further. The Army Corps of Engineers and Army National Guard announced Wednesday that the troubled section had been fixed, but a 100-foot-long slide west of the original was starting to crumble.  Watch the Mississippi's waters rise » . For the 5,000 residents of Lincoln County, it is now a matter of waiting and hoping the levee holds until the Mississippi crests and begins to fall. The river level stood just above 37 feet Wednesday on its secondary crest, 11 feet above flood stage, and is expected to crest again Saturday afternoon at 37.5 feet, The Associated Press reported. At Winfield High School, halls normally dominated by teens are being shared with volunteer workers and evacuated families in the school's gymnasium, which has served as an American Red Cross rescue shelter since June 16. Floodwaters have damaged 692 homes. ""Right now, I'm feeling pretty desperate and in need,"" said Sam Payne, who is staying at the high school with his wife and two children. Payne, who left his home June 17, watched as water rose to the roof after one of the first levee breaches. ""It's positive that my family is still together,"" he said. ""We're trying to hold back [our emotions]. The hard part -- the working part -- is going to be after the water finally recedes."" About 20 Lincoln County residents are completely dependent on the emergency center at the high school, according to the American Red Cross. ""What we have been doing is feeding people three times a day, even those who aren't sleeping in the gym, and giving others food and snacks to take home with them,"" said Dan Flippen, the shelter's manager. ""Luckily, the turnout of the businesses have been outstanding up here, and the school's principal and staff have been gems for us."" iReport.com: Take a flood tour of Lincoln County, MO . The administration and staff memberse have been cleaning, cooking and making space inside the school for people who have been displaced by the flooding. Students have also been taking time to help. ""The students here are constantly trying to help out in the gym,"" Flippen said. ""We have to turn anyone who isn't 18 away, but most of those kids just go outside and sandbag."" While the gym has been turned into a makeshift headquarters for the Red Cross and Salvation Army, the Army Corps of Engineers has created a loading depot for levee sandbags behind the school. Rescue officials were rushing to fill to 50,000 sandbags to fortify the levee. They brought in 200 tons of sand and called on anyone who wants to volunteer in the sandbagging effort to report to the high school. Their efforts have been vital to keeping the Pin Oak levee intact and protecting the southern end of Winfield. But with the river approaching its cresting level, sandbagging activities at the high school will stop Sunday afternoon, according to Binder. While they wait, officials watch the water levels and keep boats away from the levee. The Missouri State Water Patrol is also looking out for potential looters and people breaking into unattended cars. Only a few incidents have been reported, and law enforcement released a statement saying those caught looting flood victims would be prosecuted ""with the utmost prejudice."" Evacuations are still being scheduled for people in areas close to the rising water, and the Red Cross and Salvation Army are stocking up on supplies from individual donors, local businesses and the St. Louis Red Cross chapter. Pending the rains, the weather service said the river wouldn't begin to recede at St. Louis -- where there is flooding, but it is not significant -- until Thursday night. Forecasters said the last point on the river to finish cresting would be near Chester, Illinois, about 80 miles south of St. Louis, on Friday. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings for Lincoln County. Early Tuesday, water broke through one of the main levees in neighboring St. Charles County. Officials working around the levee are required to wear life jackets, with the levee now able to ""go at any time,"" according to Binder. Meanwhile, President Bush declared 22 Missouri counties to be disaster areas on Wednesday. The declaration makes federal funding available to state and local governments for disaster-related damages. Even with the approaching water, residents are trying to remain optimistic. ""There have certainly been some tears shed here,"" Flippen said. ""But people here are used to getting flooded, and they'll try to do the best they can. ""Just the other day, we had a a couple of guys who were driving from Oklahoma just to sandbag. It shows the type of effort people are putting in to help us out.""","Town of Winfield, Missouri, hopes crumbling Pin Oak levee holds until river crests .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A day before the United Nations held a climate change summit, New York City was blanketed with 100,000 fake copies of the New York Post tabloid, filled with content related to climate change. The Yes Men activist group says everything in the bogus edition of the tabloid is ""100 percent"" true. But the Post, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., wasn't impressed, calling the effort by perennial pranksters the Yes Men a ""Witless Spoof in Flawless Format"" in a statement released Tuesday, a day after the faux Post hit the streets. The overall endeavor, the Post said, was a ""limp effort,"" and the fraudulent newspaper ""has none of the wit and insight New Yorkers expect from their favorite paper. The Post will not be hiring any of their headline writers."" A phony ""Early City Special"" edition of the popular tabloid greeted millions of New York City commuters early Monday with a blaring ""WE'RE SCREWED"" headline. The headline and everything else in the 32-page publication, including some bogus advertisements and comics, revolved around climate change. Even the Post's notorious ""Page Six"" gossip and ""Best Sports in Town"" sections were spoofed with various true celebrity and sports articles connected to the green movement and climate change awareness. A statement released by the Yes Men, an activist group whose members have posed as officials and spokesmen of various organizations, companies and agencies, said that although their version of the New York Post is a fake, ""everything in it is 100 percent true, with all facts carefully checked by a team of editors and climate change experts.""  Watch protesters don ""SurvivaBalls"" near U.N. » . The Post parody appeared a day before Tuesday's U.N. climate change summit, ""where Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will push 100 world leaders to make serious commitments to reduce carbon emissions in the lead-up to the Copenhagen climate conference in December,"" the group said. The United Nations said that 54 presidents, 35 prime ministers and one prince were attending Tuesday's events. Former Vice President Al Gore and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also were involved. Yes Men spokeswoman Natalie Johns said the aim of the stunt was to ""report really important and relevant issues that have not been in the press a day before a U.N. climate meeting."" Johns said the fake New York Post printing cost between $30,000 and $40,000, and was funded by numerous private donations of various amounts. On November 12, 2008, New Yorkers awoke to the organization's first prank-in-print, finding strategically located ""special editions"" of The New York Times around the city. The counterfeit Times, dated July 4, 2009, centered on the fictitious conclusion of the Iraq war, as well as other matters connected with the end of the Bush administration. The Yes Men also have posed as spokesmen for organizations including the World Trade Organization and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

"(CNN) -- Just as there are many choices of drivers, putters, balls, and other equipment, there are just as many choices of golf instructors. The process of how you choose your golf instructor is as unique as your finger prints. However, just like there are certain things you want to know before choosing your doctor, there are certain items you should inquire of your instructor. Compatibility - It is your responsibility to insure that there is a fit between you and your instructor on all levels, personality type, mutual goals, similar outlooks on the game, and your instructor's ability to relate to your individual needs. Before throwing a dart in the phone book under ""golf instruction"", research the professionals in your area. One way is to ask friends and playing partners for referrals of good instructors in your area. Ask them about pricing, reputation, location, and their improvement under the instructor's tutelage. If you get along with your playing partners and the instructor does too, odds are you have found a fit. Then, call the instructor and ask if they have time to talk to you about your game and improvement goals. A good instructor will be happy to talk to you about your game, and get to know you as an individual, prior to helping you with your golf game. Accreditation and Experience - Does your golf instructor have the education and experience to take your game to any level you desire? Many individuals claim to be golf instructors. Many of these individuals are self-proclaimed ""experts,"" or had enough money to take a one to two week course on how to teach golf and make more money. In seeking a golf professional to help you with your game, insure that the individual has an active accreditation with the PGA or LPGA, or, has demonstrated an inarguable ability to help players of many levels improve through many years of practice. Other associations claim they produce golf instructors. However, these organizations have one focus, to make money, not to produce solid golf instructors. Inquire of your instructor their accreditation, as well as their education both on and off the golf course. Check with the LPGA or PGA websites to confirm your potential golf instructor's accreditation with that organization, and, how much experience the instructor possesses. Inquire of the instructor's philosophy and past success stories. If needed, ask for references of students from all skill levels that you can contact. Video - Video swing analysis has become a staple for all golf instruction. It is no longer an option. If you are paying for instruction that does not include video review of your game, you should reconsider why you are paying for golf instruction. Video, when used correctly, is a third pair of eyes (you and your instructor are first and second). This is similar to a doctor using an X-Ray or M.R.I, to diagnosis a health issue. Your golf instructor should be using video in the same manner. Video should confirm the diagnosis to you, not the instructor. A good golf instructor has the ability to see the flaw first, and use his or her knowledge of that flaw to diagnose a cure or drill for you to practice to realize improvement. If your golf instructor is relying solely on video to tell what is happening in your swing, you will eventually lose trust in the instructor's ability to help you. You would second guess a doctor's ability to help you if he or she did not use their ability first and confirm their thoughts with tests. Then why would you rely on an instructor who is not ""practicing"" golf instruction in the same manner? Follow-up Communication - Your golf instructor should have a program available for you to utilize to ask questions, give feedback, receive follow-up instructions, schedule lessons, or make other inquiries after your lesson. Some instructors offer their phone numbers after hours. Others utilize the internet for follow-up and communication purposes. Regardless of what form of communication is available to you after the lesson, your instructor should be available, at no extra charge, within a reasonable amount of time, to answer your questions and take interest in your concerns.","Handy hints from the PGA to help secure the right golf coach for your game .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Doctors gave Anna Nicole Smith a long list of dangerous drugs over the three years before her death, including while she was pregnant, according to sworn statements by investigators from state agencies. Dosages prescribed to Anna Nicole Smith were ""dangerously high,"" a drug expert says in an affidavit. Two doctors charged in connection with Smith's death allegedly also crossed professional lines by having personal relationships with their patient, the court documents released Tuesday said. Smith died in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, of what was later ruled to be ""acute combined drug intoxication."" One affidavit quoted a pharmacist who refused to fill a prescription written for Smith as saying he warned one doctor he would not give her the drug ""unless you want your picture on the front page of the National Enquirer."" One investigator described the former Playboy model and reality show TV star as a ""drug seeker."" Her boyfriend, Howard K. Stern, and two doctors -- Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor -- were charged with several felonies, including conspiring to furnish controlled substances, unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions from June 2004 through January 2007. All three defendants entered not-guilty pleas in May. A preliminary hearing is set for next month in the case. Smith, whose real name was Vickie Lynn Marshall, ""was given drugs in excessive amounts,"" according to a medical expert consulted and quoted by a state medical board investigator. Dr. Jill Klessig also told an investigator that ""in addition to the prescribing issues, there appears to have been a personal relationship"" between Smith and the two doctors that crossed the boundaries of professionalism. The affidavit references a video clip of Kapoor ""kissing and snuggling"" with Smith ""in a reclined position in a nightclub setting."" Eroshevich traveled to the Bahamas to visit Smith and was with her for four days in Hollywood, Florida, four days before her death, an investigator said in an affidavit. The doctor personally visited a Burbank, California, pharmacy in September 2006 to get a sleep aid -- chloral hydrate -- for Smith to use in the Bahamas. It was just four days after Smith gave birth to a daughter in Nassau. ""I wouldn't give her chloral hydrate unless you want your picture on the front page of the National Enquirer,"" pharmacist Steve Mazlin told Eroshevich, according to the affidavit. The affidavit from Jon Genens, a senior investigator with the California medical board, detailed dozens of prescriptions written for Smith -- under several aliases -- for a long list of narcotics and sleep aids. Genens said even during the time she was pregnant -- starting in January 2006 -- Kapoor prescribed an average of 10 tablets of Methadone per day for Smith. He noted that Kapoor lowered the dosage in the last three months of her pregnancy. The volume of dangerous drugs being ordered by doctors spurred the chief pharmacist at the store where most of the prescriptions were filled to call a drug expert for advice in late 2006, according to a sworn statement by California Department of Justice Special Agent Jennifer Doss. Dr. Greg Thompson told Doss he recalled the dosages were ""dangerously high."" ""Dr. Thompson stated they might work for a drug addict under supervised care, or with a dying cancer patient in a hospital, or 'if you were going to kill someone,' "" Doss said. Thompson told Doss he later ""admonished Dr. Eroshevich"" about the drugs she was requesting for Smith. ""Dr. Thompson stated Dr. Eroshevich was obviously not familiar with a lot of medications she was prescribing for ... Smith,"" Doss said in her affidavit. The Doss affidavit said the doctor used Smith's boyfriend as a cover to get the prescriptions filled. ""Of the 12 medications found in Anna Nicole Smith's hotel room at the time of her death, seven medications were prescribed the name of Howard K. Stearn [believed to be Howard K. Stern] by Dr. Eroshevich,"" Agent Doss said. The drugs were apparently personally delivered to Smith in the Bahamas and Florida by her doctor, Doss said. ""It is reasonable to believe that Dr. Eroshevich provided Anna Nicole Smith prescription medications and controlled substances by transporting them from California to Nassau, Bahamas with her on her travels to visit Anna Nicole Smith,"" Doss said.","NEW: Doctors' relationships with Smith crossed professional lines, affidavits say .

"(OPRAH.com)  -- At 13 he was selling crack. By 30 he was a hip-hop legend -- having gone, in his words, ""from grams to Grammys."" Jay-Z tells Oprah Winfrey a conversation with his father freed him ""one hundred percent."" Now Jay-Z charts his escape from the hard-knock life, describes the reunion that healed the wounds of his childhood -- and even reveals his personal creed. The rapper, now 39, was born Shawn Carter in Brooklyn, New York. His albums include ""Reasonable Doubt,"" ""The Black Album"" and the just-released ""The Blueprint 3."" Jay-Z also owns a portion of the NBA's New Jersey Nets and founded, with Damon Dash, the clothing line Rocawear. Jay-Z spoke with Oprah Winfrey about his father, his anger and his old life. The following is an edited version of the interview. Oprah Winfrey: When you were 5, your family moved to the Marcy projects -- and then your father left when you were 11. When you look back at that, what did your 11-year-old self feel? Jay-Z: Anger. At the whole situation. Because when you're growing up, your dad is your superhero. Once you've let yourself fall that in love with someone, once you put him on such a high pedestal and he lets you down, you never want to experience that pain again. So I remember just being really quiet and really cold. Never wanting to let myself get close to someone like that again. I carried that feeling throughout my life, until my father and I met up before he died. Oprah: Wow. I've never heard a man phrase it that way. You know, I've done many shows about divorce, and the real crime is when the kids aren't told. They just wake up one day and their dad is gone. Did that happen to you? Jay-Z: We were told our parents would separate, but the reasons weren't explained. My mom prepared us more than he did. I don't think he was ready for that level of discussion and emotion. He was a guy who was pretty detached from his feelings. Oprah: Did you wonder why he left? Jay-Z: I summed it up that they weren't getting along. There was a lot of arguing. Oprah: And did you know you were angry? Jay-Z: Yeah. I also felt protective of my mom. I remember telling her, ""Don't worry, when I get big, I'm going to take care of this."" I felt like I had to step up. I was 11 years old, right? But I felt I had to make the situation better. Oprah: How did that change you? Jay-Z: It made me not express my feelings as much. I was already a shy kid, and it made me a little reclusive. But it also made me independent. And stronger. It was a weird juxtaposition. Oprah: I've read that when you were 12, you shot your brother in the shoulder. Did your father's leaving have anything to do with that? Did it turn you into the kind of angry kid who would end up shooting his brother? Jay-Z: Yes -- and my brother was dealing with a lot of demons. Oprah: How old was he? Jay-Z: About 16. He was doing a lot of drugs. He was taking stuff from our family. I was the youngest, but I felt like I needed to protect everybody. Oprah: So how did you get back in touch with your father? Jay-Z: My mom set up a meeting. And now I realize why -- it makes all the sense in the world. I remember very distinctly that I had a conversation with her in my kitchen. I was saying, ""You know, Ma, I've really been trying to look inward, and maybe I'm just not meant to fall in love like other people do."" She just looked at me like, ""Hush up, boy."" Oprah: Wow. Jay-Z: And I guess from that point, she figured out what was wrong with me, and she planned a meeting between me and my father. I was like, ""Ma, I'm a grown man. I don't need a dad now."" Oprah: You didn't feel a hole in your soul? Jay-Z: I never looked at that. I guess I didn't want to deal with it. Because, you know, once I looked, I'd have to do something about it. And I guess I still had too much resentment and anger. Oprah: In one of your songs, you wrote that you weren't sure if your father even remembered your birthday is in December. Jay-Z: I believed that. When I was a kid, I once waited for him on a bench. He never showed up. Even as an adult, that affected me. So when my mom set up this meeting, I told her he wouldn't come -- and the first time, he didn't. At that point, I was really done, but Mom pushed for another meeting, because she's just a beautiful soul. Oprah: The second time, your father showed up. Jay-Z: He showed up. And I gave him the real conversation. I told him how I felt the day he left. He was saying stuff like ""Man, you knew where I was."" I'm like, ""I was a kid! Do you realize how wrong you were? It was your responsibility to see me."" He finally accepted that. Oprah: Where had he been? Jay-Z: At his mom's house 10 minutes away from me. That was the sad part. Oprah: Was there any explanation he could have offered that would have satisfied you? Jay-Z: Yes -- and that's why we were able to mend our relationship. Oprah: What was his reason? Jay-Z: When I was 9, my dad's brother got stabbed, and my dad went looking for the guy who did it. People would call in the middle of the night and tell him, ""So-and-so is out here."" So my dad would get up, get his gun, and go outside to look for the guy. After a while, my mom was like, ""Hey, this is your family now. You can't do that."" But this was my dad's baby brother. And my dad was in so much pain that he started using drugs and became a different person. So I understand that the trauma of the event, coupled with the drugs, caused him to lose his soul. Oprah: When you saw him again, had he come back to himself? Jay-Z: He was broken. He had a bad liver, and he knew that if he continued drinking, it would kill him. But he didn't stop. Oprah: How soon after you saw him did he die? Jay-Z: A couple of months. I got him an apartment, I was buying furniture. And he passed away. Oprah: Did you instantly make peace with him during that conversation? Jay-Z: Pretty much. I felt lighter. Oprah: The conversation freed you in ways that you hadn't been free before? Jay-Z: One hundred percent. Oprah: Did it open the door for you to have a life with love in it? Jay-Z: Absolutely. Oprah: So what's your personal creed? Jay-Z: Be true to yourself -- and keep things simple. People complicate things. Oprah: My creed is that intention creates reality. Jay-Z: Now I'm having an aha moment! That's true. OPRAH.com: The top 20 things Oprah knows for sure . Oprah: What's the basis of your spiritual belief? Jay-Z: I believe in karma: What you do to others comes back to you. Oprah: But don't you think we're responsible only for what we know? Otherwise, you'd be facing karma for every person you sold drugs to. Jay-Z: As a kid, I didn't know any better. But now, if I were to act as if what I did wasn't bad, that would be irresponsible. And I'd have to bear the weight of that. Oprah: Maya Angelou always says, ""When you know better, you do better."" Do you still think back on that time in your life? Jay-Z: All the time. When you make music, you're constantly on the psychiatrist's couch, so to speak. That's an outlet for me. Because I'm not normally a talkative person. I don't have conversations like this for no reason. OPRAH.com: Read the entire exclusive interview from O, The Oprah Magazine .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson may soon return to the stage, at least for a ""special announcement."" Pop star Michael Jackson has been the subject of recent rumors about his health and about a comeback. The pop star has scheduled a news conference Thursday at London's O2 arena, the same venue where Prince sold out 21 nights in 2007, according to London's Outside Organisation. Although the short statement announcing Jackson's news conference did not reveal any details, Britain's Sky News reported Wednesday that the 50-year-old King of Pop has agreed to a series of summer concerts at the O2. Rumors have circulated for years about a possible Jackson concert comeback, just as speculation has abounded about his physical and financial health. Jackson's reclusive lifestyle -- and a photo last year of him being pushed in a wheelchair -- created fertile ground for health rumors. When a London tabloid reported in December that Jackson was battling a potentially fatal disease that required a life-saving lung transplant, his publicist responded that he was ""in fine health"" and that the story was ""a total fabrication."" Jackson's financial troubles in the past year have included the near-foreclosure of his Neverland Ranch in California, which he later sold. Jackson has not lived at Neverland since June 2005, after a Santa Barbara County jury found him not guilty of child molestation charges.","Musician schedules news conference for Thursday at O2 arena .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The House of Representatives passed legislation Thursday to try to recoup bonuses paid to Wall Street executives with taxpayer money. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House members Wednesday announce tax proposals affecting bonuses. The measure passed, 328-93; most Democrats supported the measure, while Republicans were sharply divided. A two-thirds majority among all members voting was required for passage. The measure would tax individuals on any bonuses received in 2009 from companies getting $5 billion or more in money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Bonuses for people with incomes over $250,000 would be taxed at a 90 percent rate. ""Today's vote rightly reflects the outrage that so many feel over the lavish bonuses that AIG provided its employees at the expense of the taxpayers who have kept this failed company afloat,"" President Obama said. ""I look forward to receiving a final product that will serve as a strong signal to the executives who run these firms that such compensation will not be tolerated."" The measure now moves to the Senate, which is considering a bill to tax retention bonuses paid to executives of companies that received federal bailout money. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday failed to get that bill passed by unanimous consent when Republican Whip Jon Kyl objected. Kyl wants ""to understand the root and cause of what happened here before we haphazardly rush and approve what we think is the remedy,"" his spokesman Ryan Patmintra said. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charlie Rangel, D-New York, told reporters Wednesday, ""We can't have any concept of we're getting even, but we must have a concept that we're trying to show that Congress ... cannot tolerate that."" The vote comes one day after AIG chief executive Edward Liddy testified before Congress that he has asked employees of the bailed-out insurer who took home more than $100,000 in bonuses to return at least half. Liddy, saying he knew that the public's patience is ""wearing thin,"" said some employees have decided on their own to return their entire bonuses to the company. More than $165 million has been slated for bonuses to AIG's senior executives; the federal government rescued the company from financial ruin with more than $170 billion in taxpayer assistance. Referring to the AIG executives who received bonuses, Rangel said, ""I don't think these are the type of people to [whom you can] make an appeal to equity and justice. I don't think they really know the difference. I don't really think they've had life experience to allow them to believe the pain that they've caused for millions of Americans."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said the bill was necessitated by the poor judgment shown by firms receiving bailout money. ""We must stabilize the financial system in order to strengthen our economy and create jobs,"" she said. ""We must also protect the American taxpayer from executives who would use their companies' second chances as opportunities for private gain. ""Because they could not use sound judgment in the use of taxpayer funds, these AIG executives will pay the Treasury in the form of this tax."" A similar proposal in the Senate would attempt to recoup bonuses by taxing both individuals and companies, but Rangel said House leaders decided against penalizing companies because they could simply ask for more taxpayer money. Earlier Wednesday, President Obama also lashed out at the bonuses given to AIG executives, calling them ""outrageous."" ""People are right to be angry. I am angry. ... People are rightly outraged about these particular bonuses,"" he said. ""But just as outrageous is the culture that these bonuses are a symptom of, that [has] existed for far too long; a situation where excess greed, excess compensation, excess risk-taking have all made us vulnerable and left us holding the bag."" CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: House passes measure to recoup bonuses with a vote of 328-93 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As Democrats continue to splinter over President Obama's proposed health care reform plan, Republicans are taking the opportunity to home in on a key argument: A good bill deserves more time and deliberation. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, says his party may have enough votes to stall Democratic health care reform. Rep. Nathan Deal, R-Georgia, said Friday that Obama's rush to put a bill together is ""totally irresponsible."" ""Most of us believe that the decision as to major reform of how Americans get their health care in this country deserves at least as much time and deliberation as it would take to select a puppy to live in the White House,"" he said. ""It took the president six months to decide how long and which puppy he was going to have. ... To expect Congress to do something on major health care reform in six days is totally irresponsible."" Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, speaking on conservative Hugh Hewitt's radio show recently, was asked about whether his party had enough votes to block health care from going forward. His answer: ""I think so. I really do."" ""If he is unsuccessful, which I anticipate and will predict he is, on getting a vote prior to the August recess, then I would say there's no way in the world they're going to get this done this year,"" he added. Obama's fight to get health care reform through Congress hit a major snag this week -- facing opposition from Republicans and fiscally conservative ""Blue Dog"" Democrats worried over the costs -- estimated to be around $1 trillion. On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced that the Senate would not take up a vote before August recess -- a deadline that Obama had originally wanted.  Watch a GOP senator lash out at Obama's plan » . Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas responded to Democratic criticism that the GOP has failed to present a viable plan. ""When the Democrats say we don't have a plan ... where's their plan? If they can't get a bill out of committee, where's their plan?"" he said. Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said it's hard to combat the Democrats' proposed legislation when it changes ""by 100 pages every time you walk into the room."" The GOP's fight is also getting political, namely looking ahead to the upcoming midterm election. ""I just hope the president keeps talking about it, keeps trying to rush it through. We can stall it. And that's going to be a huge gain for those of us who want to turn this thing over in the 2010 election,"" Inhofe said. Last week, Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, was quoted as telling the group Conservatives for Patients' Rights, which opposes Obama's health care plan, that ""if we're able to stop Obama on this, it will be his Waterloo. It will break him."" Obama debunked DeMint's claim during a live prime time news conference Wednesday night at the White House. ""I've heard that one Republican strategist told his party that even though they may want to compromise, it's better politics to 'go for the kill.' Another Republican senator said that defeating health reform is about 'breaking' me,"" he said. ""Let me be clear: This isn't about me,"" Obama said, noting that he and every member of Congress -- including those trying to scuttle health care reform legislation -- ""have great health insurance."" Obama's chief-of-staff, Rahm Emanuel, took a swipe at the GOP's political maneuvering. ""At least they're honest about their motivation,"" Emanuel told National Public Radio Friday. ""Their view about health care is about defeating President Obama. Politically, I actually appreciate what they said.""","GOP Rep. Deal: Obama spent more time picking a dog than health care plan .

"Editor's note: Rich Roll, one of Men's Fitness magazine's ""25 Fittest Guys in the World"" in 2009, was the first athlete to compete in the Ultraman World Championships on an entirely plant-based diet. He's sharing insights today as part of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's ""Four Months to Fitness"" effort. Before: At 40 years old, Rich Roll called himself ""fat, unhappy and fed up."" (CNN) -- I can still remember it, vivid as yesterday. It was the eve of my 40th birthday, and I walked upstairs to take a shower. And I was winded. I mean very winded. As I was trying to catch my breath, I took off my shirt, looked in the mirror and tried to convince myself that I was still that fit guy I had always thought I was. Somehow, I had been able to skate by on this delusion for all too many years. But the denial had finally caught up to me. I saw my true reflection, and I couldn't lie to myself anymore. I was in the worst shape of my life. I was fat, unhappy and fed up. It's the typical story. First it's the career. Then comes marriage, followed by kids. Your time is no longer your own, and you resign yourself to ""maturity,"" ""filling out"" or whatever euphemism for middle age that soothes that idea that you are simply overweight, unfit and unhealthy. I'm here to say that it doesn't have to be that way. I don't care how busy you are. I don't care how old you are, how many kids you have or how little time you think you have. The power rests within yourself to enact any change in your life you desire. And I can say this because I have seen it happen in myself and countless others. After that fateful day of clarity, I made a decision to change my life. Not a vague, wishy-washy notion that I should ""get in shape,"" maybe ""eat better"" or possibly ""go on a diet,"" but rather a specific long-term plan to enhance my wellness in a way that would not only stick, but fit within the parameters of my busy life as a full-time lawyer, husband and father of four small children. In my case, it began with a well-researched and supervised seven-day fruit and vegetable juice cleanse (during which time I weaned myself off caffeine), followed by an entirely plant-based nutrition program -- an animal-product-free regimen I have adhered to ever since. The immediate result was a rather surprising and unexpected increase in my energy levels, leading to a very gradual return to exercise, building up slowly over an extended period of time. The results were hardly overnight. But two years later, I had lost well over 30 pounds. And not only did I keep the weight off, I was the most fit I had ever been in my life. At 42 years old, I competed in the Ultraman World Championships, a grueling three-day uber-endurance triathlon circumnavigating the Big Island of Hawaii that involves 6.2 miles of swimming, 260 miles of cycling and culminates with a 52.4-mile double marathon run. I placed 11th overall and was the third-fastest American. To top it off, Men's Fitness magazine recently named me one of the ""25 Fittest Guys in the World."" (Not that I actually believe I deserve such an honor!) Quite an extreme contrast from that day I looked in the mirror. I'm not advocating that everyone should test himself or herself so severely. But my point is that change starts with a decision followed by baby steps along a new, consistent trajectory that, over time, can lead to dramatic results. I'm nothing special. I'm not a professional athlete. I'm just a normal family guy. But if I could experience such a vast transformation in my own life, I know with certainty that everybody has within himself the power to enact his own well-balanced transformation. Change is never easy. And despite what you may see advertised, I'm sorry to say there is no secret diet, mystery pill or overnight miracle that will do it for you. But there is a solution. Here are some helpful tools I employed along the way that can help you get started: . Set a goal: Vague, nonspecific notions of ""getting fit,"" ""going to the gym,"" or ""eating better"" are all fine, but they are not true ""goals"" and all too typically devolve, paving the way for relapse to old habits. Instead, establish something very concrete you would like to achieve on a future date. The more specific, the better. Then create a solid plan with reasonable interim ""steppingstone"" milestones along the way to achieving the larger goal. Chart your progress, as meeting interim milestones will boost your confidence and invest you more deeply in the ultimate goal. Create community and accountability: If you go public with your quest, then you are on the hook. A good support network is a key to success. But beware of the negative dream crushers. Be selective, surrounding yourself with people who encourage your success. Do what you love: When it comes to exercise, it shouldn't be too painful. Ideally, it should be fun. If you absolutely hate running, find something else you enjoy. Otherwise, you set yourself up to fail. And don't be too rigid -- mix it up with a variety of activities you like to keep it interesting and fresh. Don't diet: Instead, get honest about your habits and embark on implementing healthy, lasting changes in your nutrition. I feel quite strongly that a nutrition program built entirely around plant-based foods and completely devoid of animal products is optimal. Conventional wisdom would say that an athlete cannot perform on plants alone. But I am living proof that this is false, and I have ample research to support this position. Personally, I cannot overemphasize the difference this has made in my own life, a secret weapon for enhanced athletic performance and overall long-term wellness. (In the last two years, I have not gotten sick or even suffered a cold.) I realize, of course, that not everyone is ready to go 100 percent vegan, but a program built on a strong foundation of fresh organic vegetables, fruits and grains should be the focus. Don't skip meals, but reduce your portions slightly. Read the labels and educate yourself. Avoid saturated fats, processed foods and soft drinks, all of which are entirely devoid of nutritional value. Eating whole fresh foods high in nutritional content will also stave off those unhealthy urges to binge. One day at a time: Large goals can seem insurmountable. The idea that you can never eat a cupcake or sleep in again is daunting at best. Instead, just focus on what is happening today, even if it's hour to hour, and don't worry about tomorrow. ""Today, I'm not going to eat that cupcake. Maybe I'll eat it tomorrow, just not today."" And if you miss a beat, don't flog yourself; it only leads to discouragement and quitting altogether. The important thing is to make sure you get right back on it the next day -- don't let another day go by. Prioritize: Take an honest look at your average week, identify your inefficient uses of time and eliminate the things that don't serve your goals. No matter how busy you are, if you are truly honest about this inquiry, I guarantee you can make some cuts and carve out some time. Remember: Nothing changes if nothing changes. Be consistent: It's not about how much you do in a given workout or how hard it is. Ten minutes of core exercises four to five times per week is far better than one long run a week. Establishing a consistent rhythm of repetition is key, and another reason that your choice of exercise should be something you truly enjoy. Let's join together to shift the world's perspective on long-term health and wellness. No matter how old, overweight or out of shape you are, you have the power to make a decision, set a goal and create a plan. Positive change is always within your grasp, and today still remains the first day of the rest of your life. Make it count!

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- As voting was taking place in the German general election Sunday, attention was already turning to what coalition will rule the country. Social Democrats handing out flowers hope their party will stay in the ruling coalition. Few doubt that Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, CDU, will win most votes. So, will Merkel continue the current center right-center left ""grand coalition"" with the Social Democrats or will the votes suffice for a coalition with the business liberal but centrist Liberal Democrats or the FDP, a constellation Germans refer to as ""Black-Yellow."" At a press conference ostensibly to outline Germany's position at this week's G-20 summit Merkel apparently let the cat out of the bag. ""We are in a time of crisis,"" she said, ""and I believe we can pull out of the crisis faster with a Black-Yellow government."" But some political analysts believe she would prefer to keep the Social Democrats as the junior coalition partner. Polls indicate the CDU and FDP could gain a razor thin majority to form a governing coalition. Recent polls put their combined tally at around 48 percent. That is not exactly a large majority, but it's two percent more than the left of center parties, the Social Democrats, the Green Party, and the left wing ""Die Linke,"" who would reach about 46 percent if polls are accurate. The Liberal Democrats have been in opposition since 1998 and at a rally in Berlin, their leader Guido Westerwelle was sure his time has come. ""I think the voters won't allow a coalition of the left to be in power. I think they want a conservative government and they will vote to put us in power,"" he said. Westerwelle is eyeing the post of foreign minister under a future Merkel government.  What's at stake in the German election » . A government of CDU and FDP, conservatives and liberal would probably be more business friendly than the current grand coalition. Both the CDU and FDP want to cut taxes to further jumpstart Europe's largest economy which emerged from its deepest recession only a few months ago. But even optimistic economists believe cutting taxes will be all but impossible for a government which will inherit the largest public deficit in German history after the current government was forced to ruin in its public finances to bail out banks and industrial companies in the wake of the international financial crisis. And it appears more trouble lies ahead. ""After the economic crisis we will see a social crisis,"" says Henrik Enderlein an economics professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Enderlein believes a coalition with the liberals would put Merkel under pressure to implement wider ranging tax breaks than she feels are sustainable. That is why some believe Merkel would not mind continuing her coalition with the Social Democrats who oppose tax cuts and call them irresponsible in a time of disastrous public deficits. The Social Democratic contender running against Merkel, Frank Walter Steinmeier, however, has all but given up any hopes of winning. ""We want to prevent a ""black--yellow"" coalition,"" he keeps repeating at rallies. Confidence sounds different. Polls currently have the Social Democrats at around 26 percent of the vote, a disastrous figure for a party that in 1998 gained more than 40 percent. But the Social Democrat ranks were decimated in the seven years they ruled the country under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. Many traditional left wing SPD voters felt Schroeder betrayed the powerful labor wing of the party by cutting social benefits while making it easier for companies to fire employees in times of crisis. The SPD was further hit when many loyal members splintered off and joined the left wing party die Linke which also incorporates remnants of the former communist party that rules East Germany. Now Steinmeier is trying to lead the Social Democrats out of the impasse and he realizes his real chance to stay in power would be as the junior partner to Merkel. Steinmeier would keep his post as foreign minister and many political experts in Berlin think this might be what both Merkel and Steinmeier are really striving for. ""They worked very well together,"" said Gero Neugebauer of the Freie Universitat Berlin. ""The atmosphere was very good and that is very important for such a coalition."" For Germans it seems like the two choices are realistic: A coalition of CDU and FDP, or a grand coalition of CDU and SPD, like the one that is currently governing the country. Those options haven't exactly fired up the election campaigns. Both Merkel and Steinmeier were loath to attacking each other and both of them cancelled several scheduled TV appearances which would have seen them go head to head. ""This election seems kind of lame,"" one young summed it up when I asked him near Berlin's technical university. International experts have a similar opinion. One issue they feel has gotten short shrift was the war in Afghanistan. Germans have the third largest troop contingent in the country with about 4,200 soldiers stationed in the north. But Afghanistan played only a minor role in the election campaigns and in their only televised debate, Merkel and Steinmeier devoted less than three minutes to the issue, less than a week after a German ground commander had called an air strike that killed almost 100 Afghans and possibly also civilians. ""It is simply not high on the political agenda,"" says Jan Techau of the German Council on Foreign Relations., ""Most Germans are against the war in Afghanistan and having German troops there, but they don't care about it enough for it to influence the way they vote."" So Merkel and Steinmeier were careful to keep Afghanistan off the campaign agenda as best they could because they agree German troops need to stay in Afghanistan like they agree on so many topics. That did not make for an exciting campaign, but it could make for a good continuation of the grand coalition.","Angela Merkel's CDU are favorites to win the election .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- Pakistani forces in the last month foiled a planned attack on the parliament building, the intelligence agency and other federal institutions, the country's interior minister told CNN Sunday. Pakistan's parliament building was one target of a planned attack, an official says. In the last four weeks, authorities arrested three men with suicide vests who were plotting to carry out the attacks, said Interior Minister Rehman Malik. Malik would not say exactly when the men were caught. Pakistan is in the midst of an intense military offensive against Taliban militants. The militants are suspected of launching attacks inside Pakistan and in neighboring Afghanistan from their haven in the mountainous tribal region along the northwestern border. On Sunday, a suicide bomber in volatile northwestern Pakistan killed at three people and wounded 15 others, police said. The bombing rocked the Pakistani city of Peshawar, capital of North West Frontier Province. The incident took place when police approached a man acting suspiciously. The man ran away, police chased him and a gunfight ensued. The man ran out of bullets and blew himself up. Two women and seven children were among the injured. Remains of the alleged attacker were found, police said. Five houses were destroyed. The incident follows a car bombing on Saturday in Peshawar that killed two people, including the spokesman for an extremist group called Ansar ul Islam. Two suspects are in custody. Malik said Sunday the government's anti-Taliban operations will continue during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month considered to be a time of peace. Militants in North Waziristan, part of the tribal region, have said they will observe a unilateral ceasefire throughout the month. ""There will not be a ceasefire during Ramadan. We are not interested in a ceasefire,"" Malik said. ""They haven't kept their commitment in the past. We will continue targeted actions against the Taliban."" Malik also said the Taliban killed the father-in-law of its leader Baitullah Mehsud and several other relatives, accusing them of leaking information about his whereabouts. Pakistan and U.S. officials contend Mehsud was killed in an August 5 drone attack in Waziristan at his father-in-law's house. The Taliban claims Mehsud is alive but ill.","NEW: Suicide bomber in northwestern Pakistan kills at least three, authorities say .

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Police and soldiers killed at least 133 people during two days of riots between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria last year, Human Rights Watch alleged Monday. Anti-riot policemen patrol the streets in Jos, Nigeria, following riots between Christians and Muslims. Most of the victims of violence by security forces were young Muslim men, often unarmed, the group charged in testimony before a state commission examining the riots and in a separate report. More than 700 people died in the violence last November, the group said, citing local religious authorities on both sides of the divide. A 26-year-old mechanic described seeing anti-riot police known as MOPOLs hunting down people near where he worked. ""I saw them enter one house just across the street from us,"" the unnamed witness said. ""We heard shots and later we saw five bodies there. Anyone they found hiding in the garage, they shot them. They combed the garage hunting for people. This went on for about 10 minutes or so. Then they returned to their truck and left."" Another witness described police units going from house to house, summarily executing unarmed men and boys. A third said he saw an unarmed shopkeeper plead for his life. Police ordered him to lie down on the ground, the witness said. ""He kept saying, 'Please God, allow me to live.'... One of them said, 'Today you go die,' and then he shot him in the side. Then the same MOPOL shot him again. As he was going to shoot him a third time, the other MOPOL said ... 'Leave it, he's already dead.'"" The shopkeeper managed to drag himself to a neighbor's house, where the neighbor tried to stop the bleeding from wounds to the back and abdomen. Police then returned and shot tear gas into the neighbor's house, he testified. The shopkeeper ""died a short time later,"" the neighbor said. In the report, released Monday, Human Rights Watch says it ""documented 133 of these killings but believes that the actual number of arbitrary killings by security forces may be substantially higher than these figures."" James Manook, a spokesman for Plateau State where the violence occurred, said the Human Rights Watch claims are ""one of the issues that the commission has under inquiry, and given that - I do not want to comment while it's under investigation."" However, he added, "" I assure you that we remain respectful of the rule of law."" The clashes followed a dispute over an election that pitted a Christian candidate against a Muslim one in late November 2008. Police and soldiers responded to the riots with deadly force, on the same day the governor of the state issued a ""shoot-on-sight"" order, Human Rights Watch said. The group based its allegations on 151 interviews in the city of Jos in Nigeria's Plateau State, it says in the report. It withheld the names of many of the people it interviewed over the course of 18 days in December 2008 and February 2009. The report includes photographs of burned-out mosques, Christian boarding schools, and homes and businesses. The rights group said the state commission examining the riots should investigate and call for the prosecution of security forces involved. ""At least 130 men were killed by members of the very institutions charged with protecting them,"" said Corinne Dufka, senior West Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""These investigative bodies owe it to the victims and their families to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into these extremely serious allegations."" Eric Guttschuss, a Human Rights Watch researcher, testified before the commission Monday. There is a history of religious violence in central Nigeria, where majority-Muslim north Africa meets largely Christian sub-Saharan Africa. Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 1,000 people were killed in riots in 2001. Local religious leaders in Jos have been trying to bridge the differences, including setting up a soccer league with teams on which Christians and Muslims play side-by-side. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","Nigerian police, soldiers accused of killing 133 during riots in November 2008 .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Boris Kodjoe owns a mansion in Atlanta. But when he goes to answer his door, the black actor knows what it's like to be an outcast. Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested last week on a charge of disorderly conduct. ""When I'm opening the door of my own house, someone will ask me where the man of the house is, implying that I'm staff,"" said Kodjoe, best known for starring in Showtime's ""Soul Food."" It's a feeling some African-Americans say is all too common, even to this day in America: No matter your status or prominence in society, you're still typecast. That's why the recent arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr., one of the nation's most prominent African-American scholars, has stirred outrage and debate. Jelani Cobb, an author and professor at Spelman College in Atlanta, says it's troubling on many levels when ""one of the most recognizable African-Americans in the country can be arrested in his own home and have to justify being in his own home.""  Watch arrest of a Harvard scholar » . ""It's really kind of unfathomable,"" Cobb said. ""If it can happen to him, yeah, it can happen to any of us."" That's a sentiment echoed by Jimi Izrael. ""If a mild-mannered, bespectacled Ivy League professor who walks with a cane can be pulled from his own home and arrested on a minor charge, the rest of us don't stand a chance,"" Izrael wrote Tuesday on The Root, an online magazine with commentary from a variety of black perspectives that's co-founded by Gates. ""We all fit a description. We are all suspects."" In an interview with The Root, Gates said he was outraged by the incident and hopes to use the experience as a teaching tool, including a possible PBS special on racial profiling. ""I can't believe that an individual policeman on the Cambridge police force would treat any African-American male this way, and I am astonished that this happened to me; and more importantly I'm astonished that it could happen to any citizen of the United States, no matter what their race,"" Gates said. ""And I'm deeply resolved to do and say the right things so that this cannot happen again."" Voices of black America: What it's like being black in America . Gates was arrested last Thursday in broad daylight at his Cambridge, Massachusetts, home for disorderly conduct -- what the arresting officer described as ""loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space."" The charge was dropped Tuesday on the recommendation of police, and the city of Cambridge issued a statement calling the incident ""regrettable and unfortunate."" Gates had just returned from a trip to China when a police officer responded to a call about a potential break-in at his home that was phoned in by a white woman. According to the police report, Gates was in the foyer when the officer arrived. The officer asked Gates to ""step out onto the porch and speak with me,"" the report says. ""[Gates] replied, 'No, I will not.' He then demanded to know who I was. I told him that I was 'Sgt. Crowley from the Cambridge Police' and that I was 'investigating a report of a break in progress' at the residence. ""While I was making this statement, Gates opened the front door and exclaimed, 'Why, because I'm a black man in America?' "" Have race relations improved since the election of President Barack Obama? According to the report, Gates initially refused to show the officer his identification, instead asking for the officer's ID. But Gates eventually did show the officer his identification that included his home address. ""The police report says I was engaged in loud and tumultuous behavior. That's a joke,"" Gates told The Root. ""It escalated as follows: I kept saying to him, 'What is your name, and what is your badge number?' and he refused to respond. I asked him three times, and he refused to respond. And then I said, 'You're not responding because I'm a black man, and you're a white officer.'"" Known as Skip by friends and colleagues, Gates is the director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African-American Research at Harvard University, and an acclaimed PBS documentarian. While Gates' arrest lit up talk radio and blogs, it prompted others to defend the police against charges of racial profiling. ""I'd be glad if somebody called the police if somebody was breaking into my house,"" neighbor Michael Schaffer told CNN affiliate WHDH. For others, the incident symbolized something more. Seeing the police mugshot of Gates brought some African-Americans to near tears. Kim Coleman, a Washington radio host, cultural commentator and blogger, said she grew numb when she saw the mugshot. ""I was not prepared for that,"" she said. ""To see one of my heroes in a mugshot was not something that I was expecting. ... It just tells me we're not in a post-racial society."" She said there's a reason why you don't hear about prominent white people arrested in their homes: ""because it doesn't happen."" It's time for America to have a long overdue national conversation about race, Coleman said. ""When are we going to have that,"" she said. ""When are we really going to sit down and strip down and say, 'This is what I feel about you and this is what you feel about me. Now, how are we going to get over that?' "" Rebecca Walker, an award-winning author, said the arrest was devastating to scholars, writers, and artists ""who work so hard to keep a free flow of information."" ""It seems eerily ironic Mr. Gates was returning from China, where surveillance is so high and freedom of speech and ideas so curtailed,"" Walker said. ""To see the mugshot of Skip was a blow to all of us who feel some sense of safety based on our work to try to mend all of these broken fences in America -- to make ourselves into people who refuse to be limited by race and class and gender and everything else."" ""To end up, at the end of the day, treated like a criminal, unjustly stripped of our accomplishments and contributions even if only for a moment, is profoundly disturbing. We must ask ourselves what it means, and to allow ourselves to face various scenarios regarding power and freedom and how these will intersect in the coming years."" Last week, President Obama spoke at the 100th anniversary of the NAACP, saying that while minorities have made great strides ""the pain of discrimination is still felt in America."" ""Even as we inherit extraordinary progress that cannot be denied; even as we marvel at the courage and determination of so many plain folks -- we know that too many barriers still remain,"" the president said. Kodjoe, the actor, said Obama ""has affected a change in people's consciousness regarding such issues as racism and prejudice."" But he said the arrest of Gates underscores that there's more work ahead. ""I think we're moving in the right direction. But no doubt, there still is a lot of work to be done,"" Kodjoe said. ""It's not just a problem here. It's a problem worldwide. Racism is universal."" Gates said he has a newfound understanding of exactly what that means. ""There's been a very important symbolic change and that is the election of Barack Obama,"" he told The Root. ""But the only black people who truly live in a post-racial world in America all live in a very nice house on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.""","Boris Kodjoe: Arrest of Harvard prof underscores how blacks are typecast .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Some families long separated by the Korean War saw their loved ones Saturday for the first time in years near the border between North and South Korea. South Korean Yoon Ki-Dal, right, meets the children he left behind as babies during the Korean War. Yoon Ki-Dal, 88, of South Korea thought such a moment would never come. After leaving his son and daughters when they were babies during the Korean War, he was able to hold the hands of his North Korean children on Saturday. ""Father, we thought you were dead,"" his daughter, now in her 60s, told him, her face trembling. Their family was one of 97 reunited Saturday on Mount Keumgang, a North Korean resort near the eastern part of the border, after decades of separation by war and ideology. And soon these families will be separated again. They are allowed to be together for a few days. Then the South Koreans must return home. The reunions -- the first in nearly two years -- are taking place through October 1. Millions of families were separated by the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a cease-fire and no formal peace treaty. No mail, telephone or e-mail exchanges exist between ordinary citizens across the Korean border. The agreement to hold the reunions came after North and South Korea held three days of talks, mediated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, last month, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported at the time. About 10,000 people applied to take part in the reunion, but fewer than 200 families were allowed to participate. In addition to the 97 families who met Saturday, another 99 families are expected to meet next week, authorities said.  Watch families share hugs, tears » . Participants are selected randomly, and there is no date set for a further reunion, which means the tens of thousands of others who were separated by the Korean War have no idea when they may get a chance to see their loved ones -- if ever. For the many separated family members who are elderly, a reunion may never be possible. Reunions between North and South have been taking place off and on since 2000 after an inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang, Yonhap says. The last reunion took place in October 2007. Rapprochement talks between the two Koreas have hit a wall since conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008 with a tougher stance toward the North than his liberal predecessor, Roh Moo-Hyun. The two Koreas have remained in conflict since the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953. Last month, officials from both sides had the first high-level, cross-border contact in nearly two years when South Korean Unification Minister Hyun In Taek met with North Korean unity leader Kim Yang Gon. The meetings and reunions are in stark contrast to the tense public statements each side made about each other earlier this year. Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan, also referred to as the East Sea. The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened U.S. and South Korean ships near its territorial waters. South Korea condemned the action, calling the launches ""unwise."" Journalist Sohn Jie-Ae contributed to this report.","Families have reunion meeting at resort in North Korea, near border .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Images of a blazing car at the entrance of the terminal building at Glasgow airport were splashed across the front pages of Britain's Sunday papers, with many warning that Britain is under attack from a new wave of terrorism. How the British press reported the Glasgow attack. The Sunday Mirror published dramatic pictures of a burning man trying to ignite explosives in the vehicle while being sprayed with water by an off-duty policeman. The News of the World had a picture of a ""hero"" police officer pinning down a smoldering bomber. The Sunday Telegraph newspaper said Britain was feared to be under terrorist attack for the third time in 36 hours after the attack, and following the discovery of two cars packed with explosive material and nails in London. In an editorial, The Sunday Times newspaper says London and Glasgow appeared to have had a lucky escape. ""The people behind these attempted atrocities clearly have twisted minds. How else to explain an attack directed at ""ladies night"" at the Tiger Tiger nightclub? ""For Islamists -- and there seems little doubt that Muslim extremists were behind the plot -- young women drinking, dancing and enjoying themselves embodies everything they find repulsive about western society. ""There will be other weekends when we fear we will be commenting not on close shaves but on completed terrorist attacks."" The Observer newspaper said Friday's aborted London bomb attack was ""al Qaeda inspired"" and may have been linked to five terrorism suspects who have escaped Home Office control orders and are on the run. The newspaper also reports that former British prime minister Tony Blair had launched a powerful attack on ""absurd"" British Islamists who have nurtured a false ""sense of grievance"" that they are being oppressed by Britain and the United States. Blair warns that Britain is in danger of losing the battle against terrorists unless mainstream society confronts the threat. ""The idea that as a Muslim in this country that you don't have the freedom to express your religion ... I mean you've got far more freedom in this country than you do in most Muslim countries,"" Blair told Observer columnist Will Hutton. In an editorial, the newspaper says: ""Some believe that the solution to terrorism is to resolve the myriad grievances the terrorists broadcast so violently. This is a mistake. Many such grievances are imagined -- the West does not want to 'dominate the lands of Islam,' for example. ""Many more are simply not Britain's fault; we are not to blame for the parlous economic state of many Islamic countries. Instead, we should remember that it is our way of life, and the attraction it holds, that remains our best weapon. ""The truth is that our democratic structures, our economy, our values and the society we have built upon them are much stronger than we often think.""

"(CNN) -- A videotape on a Russian Web site allegedly showing a State Department employee having sex with a prostitute is a ""smear campaign"" meant to discredit the man, a State Department spokesman said Thursday. The State Department has said the tape allegedly showing an employee having sex with a prostitute is a fake. The employee, Brendan Kyle Hatcher, denied any encounter with a prostitute to his superiors at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, another State Department official said. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Beyrle, ""supports"" Hatcher, who remains at his job at the embassy. Hatcher had previously worked in the sensitive area of religious and human rights in Russia, the spokesman said. ""Mr. Hatcher ... enjoys the full confidence of Ambassador Beyrle and fully intends to serve out the rest of his tour in Moscow,"" Kelly said at an afternoon briefing at the State Department. The United States ""deplores this type of campaign and use of the Internet to smear a foreign service officer of good standing,"" he added.  Watch why the U.S. says the tape is doctored » . Beyrle was unequivocal in expressing his support in an interview with ABC News. ""Kyle Hatcher has done nothing wrong,"" he said. ""Clearly, the video we saw was a montage of lot of different clips, some of them which are clearly fabricated."" A senior State Department official said, ""It's a doctored tape and a set-up designed to implicate someone working as a liaison with religious and human rights groups in Russia."" The official said Hatcher, who is married, ""was approached by Russians; they tried to blackmail him, but he did everything correctly,"" reporting the incident to his supervisors at the Embassy. The tape then appeared on the tabloid newspaper Web site Compromat.ru and was picked up by other outlets. Diplomatic sources who declined to be named said Compromat.ru has a history of ties to Russia's security services. Russia's Foreign Ministry had no comment when asked about the video. Another senior State Department official, who has seen the video, said ""it's clear to me that it's him,"" referring to portions showing Hatcher alone in the hotel room. ""But then the lights go down,"" and the footage from there on is faked, that official said. The video of Hatcher in the hotel room was taken last year, ""somewhere in Siberia,"" said the senior State Department official who watched the video. It was shot in a hotel that Hatcher visited, the official said. When questioned about the possible motivation for creating the video, the official said it's presumed ""it was done because of his human rights work,"" in Russia. The official doubted the incident will have any effect on U.S.-Russian relations and noted that the Kremlin and the Russian Foreign Ministry have both been ""very cooperative"" in the months since the footage came to light. ""The vast majority of people there are working toward better relations,"" the official said. Another official said Hatcher is a ""great officer"" who, until last summer, was a political reporting officer focusing on religious freedom issues in Russia. The assignment lasts two years: one year in that specialty and a year on the visa-issuing line at the embassy. Last year, this official said, Hatcher was the lead officer compiling the State Department's Religious Freedom report and was given an award for his work by the ambassador. Another official confirmed that Hatcher received a meritorious honor award in 2009 and a group award in 2008. Hatcher, one official said, worked with religious groups that are considered ""outside the mainstream"" in Russia, such as Protestants and non-Christians. Such faiths often face official and unofficial discrimination in the largely Russian-Orthodox society. Another senior State Department official said, ""there is a lot of inertia"" among some special security services in Russia. ""They are pretty much unreconstructed,"" he said. The security services may have wanted to compromise Hatcher's ability to work with religious groups, he says, ""or they may have wanted to throw a stick into the spokes"" of the U.S.-Russia relationship. ""Some in Moscow,"" he said, ""are looking to integrate with the West, and others are trying to stop that."" The officials asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.

"WEST PARK, Florida (CNN) -- ""We are an army,"" says Andrea Ivory of the group gathered with her early on a Saturday morning. Breast cancer survivor Andrea Ivory is on a mission to educate Florida communities about the disease, one door at a time. Armed with clipboards, leaflets and high spirits, the energetic Ivory leads them into the neighborhood, where they start knocking on doors. The mood is lighthearted, but their mission is serious: to save lives, one house at a time. They're volunteers from the Florida Breast Health Initiative, or FBHI, and they are waging war against breast cancer. It's an effort started by Ivory, 50, herself a survivor of the disease. Every weekend in the spring and fall, she and her volunteers -- who include college students, senior citizens and suburban moms, all wearing matching T-shirts -- fan out across low-income communities in southern Florida, educating women about breast health. They especially seek out uninsured women age 35 and older, who statistics show are twice as likely to be diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer, and thus more likely to die from the disease. For Ivory, comparing this work to a battle isn't overblown. ""The only thing that we have to fight this disease and lower the mortality rate is early detection,"" she says. ""We are the troops on the front lines."" Since 2006, Ivory has helped provide more than 500 mammograms to eligible women. Ivory herself had always been diligent about getting annual mammograms, but when the breast cancer diagnosis came in 2004, she took it in stride. ""I just knew that it was for a higher purpose,"" she recalls. Ivory says that purpose became clear during her cancer treatment. Reflecting on how lucky she was to have health insurance and to have gotten annual mammograms, she realized that thousands of women without health care were likely falling through the cracks and putting themselves at risk. ""Those women don't even have a fighting chance,"" she says. ""The mission became reach[ing] those women."" Ivory started FBHI to do just that. Her mantra: ""Early detection is the best protection."" Do you know someone who should be a CNN Hero? Nominations are open at CNN.com/Heroes . The operation runs like clockwork. The first three Saturdays of each month are devoted to outreach -- distributing educational materials and signing up women for free mammograms. She and her volunteers have visited nearly 18,000 homes. ""I love knocking on doors,"" Ivory says with a smile. ""I like to think of us as little pixies spreading breast cancer awareness."" On the last Saturday of each month, a large mobile mammography van from a partner hospital rolls into the neighborhood, bringing screening technology directly to women who need it. As they line up around the van, the excitement is palpable. Since many have never had a mammogram, Ivory and her team try to make the experience fun -- providing refreshments, smiles and support. One mammogram recipient said the ""convenience factor"" of the free screenings made the offer too hard to refuse. ""Ultimately this is the reason we do the work that we do,"" says Ivory, ""because we want to screen women who would not ordinarily have [the] opportunity.""  Watch Ivory and her army in action » . Telmilda Ariza, 62, always had health insurance, but after losing her job, her annual mammogram became a financial burden. She smiles when recalling the volunteers' first visit to her home. ""They knocked on my door and, wow! It was [a] miracle, coming from the sky,"" she says. ""It's something I really needed."" Ariza was so grateful that she started volunteering and knocking on doors herself.  Watch Ariza describe how she went from recipient to volunteer » . Charlene Thomas, another of Ivory's regular volunteers, considers herself living proof of the program's impact. Uninsured, she'd paid for her mammogram out of her own pocket, but when she needed a follow-up, she kept putting it off because it was so expensive. ""I had other priorities. It seems stupid now,"" she admits. ""But I didn't think anything was wrong with me."" She finally asked Ivory for help and FBHI paid for the screening. It led Thomas to a cancer diagnosis and ultimately a mastectomy. ""The fact that I was diagnosed and am cancer free -- there's no way I would've done it without the Florida Breast Health Initiative,"" says Thomas, who was back knocking on doors three weeks after surgery. ""Now I feel more of a sense of urgency. I'm knocking on doors trying to find myself."" Stories like this only deepen Ivory's commitment to her cause. For her, every day is a chance to educate women about fighting the disease and Ivory says she's determined to expand her efforts around Florida and far beyond the boundaries of her state.  Watch Ivory's group bring mobile mammography to the neighborhoods » . ""In the future, we want a fleet of mammogram vans. We'd love to do outreaches all over the country,"" she says. ""No woman needs to die from breast cancer. I can't be a doctor, but I know I can save a life. Every time I knock on the door, it's a chance to do that."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- All five members of a family found slain inside a Beason, Illinois, home early this week were beaten to death, police said Thursday. Police officers stand patrol outside the Gee household late Monday evening. A pathologist determined that the five -- Raymond Gee, 46; Ruth Gee, 39; and three children -- had been beaten, Logan County Sheriff Steve Nichols told reporters. ""All the injuries at the scene were from blunt-force trauma."" The three children were identified as Justina Constant, 16, Dillen Constant, 14, and Austin Gee, 11. A 3-year-old girl remained in critical but stable condition Thursday at a hospital, Nichols said. He said he would not divulge or speculate what the family was beaten with, and remained tight-lipped about many aspects of the deaths, including when authorities believe they occurred. Beason is in central Illinois, about 45 miles northeast of Springfield, the state capital. A task force has been formed with officers from several different agencies to investigate the homicides, the sheriff said. Processing of the crime scene concluded Wednesday afternoon, and ""hundreds of seized items"" are being processed, he said. ""Forensic evidence in this case is significant."" The sheriff has said authorities received a 911 call about a possible shooting at the home shortly before 4:30 p.m. Monday.

"CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee (CNN) -- An annual family fishing trip to the Florida keys took a bloody and life-changing turn for Jordan Thomas. Noah Parton, 6, got prosthetics from foundation started by Jordan Thomas, right. ""It was a beautiful day and we were going to go out spear fishing that night,"" said Thomas, who was 16 during the 2005 trip. But when he jumped into the water, the boat's wake dragged Thomas hard into its sharp, whirling propellers. He immediately knew what was about to happen. ""I looked down -- my black fins were gone and all I saw was red just everywhere,"" said Thomas, an athletic teen who was captain of his high school's golf team. ""But I had this unbelievable calmness over my body.""  Watch video of Thomas telling his story » . His father and mother, both doctors from Chattanooga, Tennessee, jumped into action. ""All of a sudden, my 16-year old, happy-go-lucky captain of the golf team was potentially dying,"" said Dr. Liz Kennedy-Thomas. She worked to stanch the blood flow from her son's legs while his father rushed the boat to shore and fetched paramedics. Thomas was rushed to a hospital where he spent the next two weeks -- undergoing several surgeries on what was left of his legs and, along the way, discovering what would become his life's work. While there, Thomas visited other amputees. ""I just remember seeing so many kids who didn't have parents, didn't have health care,"" he said. ""I just knew that the future was grim for them."" The top-of-the-line prosthetics Thomas was fitted with -- the ones that helped him return to the golf links -- cost about $22,000. He learned that many insurance plans only cover about $5,000. That's especially tough on child amputees, who will outgrow several limbs before adulthood. ""I had no clue,"" he said. ""It's one of those things, unless you're affected by it, you just don't know."" Thomas knew he was lucky. With a financially stable family, he'll always be able to afford good legs. He asked his family to give a donation to help others, but ultimately they decided to launch a fundraising foundation together. ""By the time we got home, we had bracelets -- all kinds of stuff,"" Kennedy-Thomas said. ""The foundation was just sort of started by the time we got home."" The Jordan Thomas Foundation has raised $350,000 through bracelets, charity golf tournaments and cookouts. Some of that is paying for prosthetics for three children until they reach age 18. One of them is Noah Parton. The precocious 6-year-old born with a congenital heart defect had a complication with a tube inserted in his right leg, leading to an amputation above his knee. His family's insurance would only pay for what's called a ""stubby"" -- a wooden artificial leg without a bendable knee. ""His first bendable knee ... didn't have a certain number or something that would apply and they refused to pay for it,"" said Noah's mother, Nancy Parton, who lives with her son about an hour north of Chattanooga, in Evensville, Tennessee. Noah couldn't run and play with other children. And even day-to-day activities were tough. ""It was hard to put him in the car because his leg stuck out straight and I'd have my seat up as far as it would go and it would still hit the back of the seat,"" she said. Thomas's foundation stepped in, buying Noah several knee devices -- a new one for each new leg he needs as he grows. Now, his mom said, Noah is unstoppable. ""He loves to climb stairs now; he tries to ride bicycles,"" she said. ""You name it, he does it. ""Take him to the park [with] any other kid; he'll just blow you away."" As Congress debates overhauling the nation's healthcare system, prosthetics are quietly getting some attention. In May, Rep. Robert Andrews, a New Jersey Democrat, introduced the Prosthetic and Orthotic Parity Act, which would require insurance companies to cover prosthetics at the same rate they do surgery. ""It's pretty simple,"" Andrews said. ""Prosthetic devices are not cosmetic. You can't walk without one or you can't lift something without one and I think one of the reasons people are so upset about the health care system in this country is they had hassles like this."" Seventeen states have passed similar laws, most recently Missouri. But amputee advocates say there needs to be a national law. Kendra Calhoun, president and CEO of the Amputee Coalition of America, says there are 1.8 million amputees in the United States and at least 25,000 of them are children. Calhoun said that with more sweeping healthcare legislation taking all the attention, ""our biggest hurdle [for a prosthetics law] right now is being heard."" Some insurance companies have argued that premiums would go up for everyone if they're forced to cover prosthetics to the extent advocates want. Advocates cite a study they say shows it would cost beneficiaries about five cents per month. Meanwhile Jordan, who's now a junior in college, says he'd like to become a voice for otherwise voiceless children. ""I'd really like to move into advocacy, giving a voice to the amputee community and just helping as many people as possible,"" he said. ""Just making a difference and letting these kids live normal and happy, productive lives."" CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","Fishing trip turned tragic for 16-year-old Jordan Thomas .

In the dark, cinematic ""Batman: Arkham Asylum,"" Batman must escape from a spooky psychiatric hospital. That's what Emmy-winning TV writer Paul Dini did in creating ""Batman: Arkham Asylum,"" a video game coming out in late August. Buzz is building online for the dark, cinematic game, which reimagines a brooding Batman and his most notorious nemesis, the Joker, for an experience that's reminiscent of ""The Dark Knight"" blockbuster movie. You want mayhem, insanity and brutality? Get ready for all of it. ""This is the Batman movie I would have liked to have written,"" said Dini, who was scheduled to discuss the game during a panel Saturday at Comic-Con International, the huge celebration of comic-book culture in San Diego, California. ""This is him with all the good stuff."" The atmospheric game pits Batman against Joker in a battle of wits and brawn after the Clown Prince of Crime traps the Caped Crusader inside Arkham Asylum, Gotham's psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane. After the trap is sprung, the Joker releases the inmates, including some of Batman's most ferocious enemies: Bane, Harley Quinn, Mr. Zsasz, Poison Ivy and Killer Croc. Batman has appeared in video games since 1986, but none as ambitious or complex as ""Arkham Asylum,"" which draws much of its inspiration from the character's comic mythology. The game will be released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows. It's being developed by Rocksteady Studios and will be published by Eidos Interactive in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and DC Comics. (Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment is a division of Time Warner, which owns CNN.) As the lead writer for the game, Dini said he was given a clean slate to work from. Because there was no movie, graphic novel or comic tie-in to follow, he was able to create an original story. Dini's familiarity with the main character may help win the hearts and wallets of gamers. Winner of five Emmy awards, Dini has worked on Batman comic books and written episodes of ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and later, ""Batman Beyond."" Dini, who has also written for the ABC-TV hit ""Lost,"" said he was influenced by Batman lore from character creator Bob Kane, the Batman comics of the 1960s and the Dark Knight graphic novels of Frank Miller. In creating his story's look and tone, Dini said he chose his favorite elements from different incarnations of Batman. For example, the game emphasizes Batman's intellect and use of technology by solving puzzles with the help of such tools as X-ray scanning and a pheromone tracker. ""Detective work is a crucial game element,"" Dini said. ""There are a lot of forensics aspects to the story."" If you're expecting a Heath Ledger-like Joker in ""Batman: Arkham Asylum,"" you may be disappointed. With his less-smudgy makeup, spiky green hair and maniacal cackle, Dini's creation looks and acts more like earlier versions of the iconic villain. Kevin Conroy voices Batman in the game, while the Joker is voiced by Mark Hamill, known to millions as Luke Skywalker in the ""Star Wars"" movies. Conroy and Hamill were scheduled to join Dini at Comic-Con this weekend. Both actors also did the voices in ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" making the game feel very familiar. Sterling McGarvey, a senior editor for G4TV, said the game's developers were smart to rely heavily on the animated TV series. ""An entire generation of Batman fans grew up with the animated Batman,"" he said. ""It is a beloved, storied franchise with very few good games."" The Internet is full of videos showing glimpses of the game, including movie-like trailers, demo gameplay, characters and layouts of Arkham Asylum. Among Batman fans and gaming reviewers, early reviews have been strong. Brian Crecente, editor-in-chief of Kotaku.com, said he likes the way the developers combined elements to create the ultimate Batman from the fans' perspective. ""Part dark, broody Batman, part serious crime fighter, but also part detective,"" Crecente said. ""Batman has this huge universe. Why not cherry-pick the best stuff and put it in the game?"" A key character in the game is Arkham Asylum itself, with its spooky corridors and Gothic architecture. Dini loves its ""mix of dark, creepy, steam punk and Victorian"" and calls it the perfect location in Gotham City for the gameplay. ""It is a totally over the top mansion with gargoyles on the inside,"" added Crecente. ""Very cool."" Dini heaped praise on how the developers made his story come to life. He hopes fans who know Batman will love how familiar it feels, while gamers will love the action. ""Fans of the canon will be happy,"" McGarvey agreed. ""But the game was designed more for the Batman fan than a hardcore gamer."" Crecente describes the game's combat as fluid and quick, with a martial arts feel. Acting as Batman, players will be able to hide in the shadows and stealthily take out their enemies. All the gaming mechanics in the world won't save Batman unless fans get drawn into the story. Remember Lego Batman? But Dini seems confident that gamers will respond to his vision. ""Nobody loves a good Batman story more than I do,"" he said.","Online buzz is strong for upcoming ""Batman: Arkham Asylum"" video game .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- An underemployed Spanish matador is breaking tradition and carrying advertising on his capes in the bullring -- promoting a soft drink aimed at gays. Matador Joselito Ortega in an exhibition fight on Sept. 23 in the southern Spanish city of Malaga. While fighting bulls, matador Joselito Ortega will use capes embroidered with the words ""Gay Up,"" the name of the energy drink. The move has many in the macho-steeped world of bullfighting seeing red. But Ortega, 29, told CNN, ""I'm glad to be the first person (in bullfighting) whom the gay community will take as an icon."" ""People think the bullfighter is very tough, very rude and they only like women,"" Ortega added. ""But we are in 2009. Everything must change."" Industry experts said it would be the first time advertising will appear on bullfighter's capes -- the large one used when the bull rushes into the ring, and a smaller one used later as the matador moves in for the kill. In the 1980s, matador Luis Reina had a contract showing the brand name of Japanese electronics giant Akai on parts of his shiny ""suit of lights,"" while fighting. ""But that lasted just one or two fights,"" recalls Curro Vazquez, a former bullfighter who now manages one of Spain's top-tier matadors, Cayetano Rivero Ordonez. Rivero Ordonez has declined offers to carry publicity on his bullfighter's suit and capes while in the ring, Vazquez said, out of respect for ""the ritual of bullfighting."" ""The cape is a sacred thing,"" said Vazquez, adding that it's fine for premier bullfighters -- who are treated like rock stars -- to have lucrative endorsement deals for products, but only outside of the ring. This is the first endorsement deal of any kind for Ortega. He became a full matador in 2006, facing the biggest bulls, but said he's fought only six or seven fights since then. Yet a bullfighter in demand can have dozens of fights in just a single season. ""Ortega is a new bullfighter and he might see this as a way to get known,"" Vazquez said. If so, it appears to be working. Ortega and his drinks company have been flooded with media queries since they made the announcement this week. Pedro Suarez, the CEO at Grupo Banus Pi, the firm that makes Gay Up and took over management of Ortega's career just two weeks ago, said they plan to organize an exhibition fight for Ortega soon, and sell the TV rights exclusively. Gay Up is a non-alcoholic energy drink made in Spain, drawn from a formula originally from Colombia. Suarez said the company tried to sponsor a Spanish football (soccer) team but was turned down because of the Gay Up brand. Then they found Ortega, who says he's not gay. He's been gored six or seven times in his career, which started 13 years ago as a junior bullfighter. ""All sports teams have advertising on their uniforms,"" Ortega said, insisting he'd continue to fight bulls the same way, even with ads on his capes. Bull breeder Juan Pedro Domecq Morenes welcomed the change, saying it might help revive Spain's billion-dollar bullfighting industry, which he said in recent years has seen a 45 percent decline in the number of fights, especially in smaller village bullrings. ""Only God is sacred,"" said Domecq, who also publishes a bullfighting Web site. ""The rest of the traditions have to advance, modernize.""","Matador Joselito Ortega will use capes embroidered with the words ""Gay Up""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hundreds of thousands of children worldwide are thought to be working full-time on tobacco farms, suffering from toxic levels of nicotine exposure and abusive labor conditions. Children as young as five-years-old work on tobacco farms in Malawi, according to Plan International. In Malawi alone there are an estimated 78,000 boys and girls employed in tobacco harvesting. On average they earn 17 cents for a 12-hour day of back-breaking, bare-handed work, according to a recent report from Plan International. Handling burley tobacco leaves without gloves, in unwashed clothes and rarely bathing, these children can absorb the same amount of nicotine in one day of harvesting that they would from smoking 50 cigarettes. ""Sometimes it feels like you don't have enough breath...You reach a point where you cannot breathe because of the pain in your chest. Then the blood comes when you vomit. At the end, most of this dies and then you remain with a headache,"" the report quoted one child describing how he felt at the end of the day. See pictures of Malawi's child tobacco farmers » . ""Nicotine is water soluble and can enter via the skin, so if it has recently rained, or there is heavy dew, the nicotine migrates into the water on the leaf. If that water gets on to your shirt it essentially becomes a giant nicotine patch,"" explained Henry Spiller of the Kentucky Regional Poison Center. After reading the Plan report, Spiller, who has researched Green Tobacco Sickness (GTS) in children working on tobacco farms in the U.S., told CNN that the Malawi children's symptoms were ""absolutely"" consistent with GTS. The Minister of Labor for Malawi, Yunnus Mussa, has denied the findings of the Plan report and told CNN their figures were ""absolute trash."" According to Mussa, the government has been hard at work with UNICEF for the past two years to eliminate child labor and has made substantial progress. ""No estate-owner has ever employed children age five to 14,"" he added. In 2007 UNICEF estimated that 29 percent of children ages five to 14-years-old in Malawi worked, and that the majority of those children worked in agriculture. There are more than 30,000 smallholder farmers in tobacco production and the crop contributes 70 percent of foreign exchange and 30 percent of GDP, according to the government Web site. Figures aside, the pictures speak for themselves, showing that the danger of nicotine poisoning is real and that better regulation and monitoring is needed. ""There are a couple of things that could prevent this, like you should wash or change shirts,"" Spiller said, citing a study in which sweat rung out from tobacco workers' shirts contained up to 98mcg/mL of nicotine. As well as exploitative conditions, the children described repeated physical and sexual abuse from their supervisors. Many of the kids also complained of ""sticky stuff"" from the stalks that they could not wash off their hands because they had no access to soap or water, according to Glynis Clacherty, who interviewed the children first-hand for the Plan report. ""We are busy working and we don't have time to go for bathing, so we develop those sores,"" one 15-year-old girl told Clacherty. The 44 children she interviewed were working full-time on both large estates and small family farms, but none were working for their own families, and 36 of them were orphans. The main reason the children gave for working was poverty: lack of food, clothing or money to go to school were frequently cited. ""A lot think it's fine for children to work. They don't see the dangers of the pesticides or the opportunity cost of not going to school,"" said Susan Gunn, an expert in hazardous child labor at the International Labor Organization (ILO), referring to farmers in East Africa. ""The new globalization of agriculture has a tendency to increase the demand for child labor,"" explained Gunn. When you have growers that are working under contract to larger companies, in industries such as tobacco, sugar or flowers, the contract is made with the adults, who in turn use their families to reach a quota or get a livable income."" In recent years multinational tobacco corporations have been rapidly shifting farming production away from rich countries like the United States. Nearly 75 percent of tobacco production is now done in developing countries such as Malawi, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, China, Brazil and India. Re-location to poorer states by multinational firms increases the demand for all types of labor their, not just that of children, according to Professor Margaret McMillan of Tufts University. If anything, she argues, increased investment can actually bring higher salaries and improved monitoring of abuse. ""If children are working in the tobacco fields, they are probably very poor and the alternatives could be even worse,"" she said. ""I firmly believe that engagement by international corporations in African agriculture must happen, but they should be monitored on all fronts."" Today UNICEF, the ILO, Plan and others all remain active in Malawi, working with the government to develop links between the ministries of labor and agriculture to end child labor on tobacco farms. Since the report came out in August, Plan International told CNN in an email that ""the government has been constructive in their response and are discussing/looking to work with Plan to conduct a national survey to gauge the true scale of the issue and better enforcement of existing child labor laws.""","Children can absorb up to 50 cigarettes worth of nicotine on wet days .

"(CNN) -- In just a few short weeks, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach could wake up at his home in Englewood, New Jersey, with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi camped a few feet from his front lawn. Gadhafi may be staying in a tent on the front lawn of a New Jersey house owned by the Libyan Mission. The authoritarian ruler of Libya is rumored to be planning to stay in an air-conditioned tent on the front lawn of a house owned by the Libyan Mission when he attends the U.N. General Assembly meeting in September. Members of the predominately Orthodox Jewish Englewood community are less than enthused about a visit from a leader who has made anti-Zionist statements in the past. The recent release of the convicted Lockerbie bomber to Libya has heightened the animosity. On Monday, Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, called for the U.S. Department of State to restrict Gadhafi's travel to the area around U.N. headquarters in New York City, saying in a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton he ""was particularly concerned by news reports indicating that [Gadhafi] plans to stay in New Jersey, where the families of many Pan Am 103 victims reside."" A representative from the Libyan Mission in New York would not confirm Gadhafi will stay in Englewood, only that he is scheduled to come to New York. Gadhafi has a history of setting up his extensive tent when visiting other countries, including Russia and France. Media reports have said that his request to pitch his tent in Central Park had been denied, and the New Jersey property was a likely second choice. Boteach said he had previously been willing to approach Gadhafi's rumored visit with an open mind, but he backtracked after the Lockerbie bomber's release. ""Judging by his actions, he hasn't changed one iota,"" Boteach said. ""He loves terrorists and welcomes them as heroes and speaks with a forked tongue. As soon as he had the opportunity he lionized people who committed murderous acts. Gadhafi is a fraud. I don't want him or his security team near my home."" Englewood Mayor Michael Wildes said he was not informed of plans to erect a tent on the property, and no special permissions were requested from the zoning department. Only through neighborhood residents and media coverage was he alerted to construction on the house that, according to Boteach, began around three months ago. The mayor said he was ""mortified as a Jew and embarrassed as an American that a financier of terrorism is on U.S. soil. [Gadhafi] is someone who has embraced terrorism and has not changed his spots."" Wildes said the Libyan Mission has ""not paid a nickel"" on taxes for the property, and said he would only be ""willing to sit down with him if he brings a check to cover years of back taxes and overtime pay for the additional police forces needed for his stay, and apologizes to the Jewish residents and the Lockerbie victims' families of New Jersey."" Boteach, in a piece posted Thursday on The Huffington Post, where he is a regular contributor, said the residence had been left ""derelict and neglected"" for many years until the recent construction. In opposition to Gadhafi's possible visit to Englewood, Boteach said he plans several steps, including legal action, which he said would be in response to construction workers knocking down his fence and cutting down his trees. ""My plan is to sue them, extract as much money as possible and use Libyan money for planting trees instead of buying bombs,"" he wrote in another Huffington Post piece Monday. Boteach and Wildes also are planning a protest at the construction site on Sunday.","Gadhafi travels with air-conditioned tent which he stays in .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Former South Korean President and Nobel Laureate Kim Dae-jung, who struggled for democracy for decades and prodded communist North Korea toward rapprochement, died of heart failure on Tuesday, hospital officials said. As president of South Korea, Kim Dae-jung helped bridge differences with North Korea. He was either 83 or 85, according to conflicting sources. The Nobel Prize Web site indicates he was born on December 3, 1925. The Kim presidential library lists his birth date as January 5, 1924. He served as president from 1998 to 2003, and in 2000, he won the Nobel Peace Prize for fostering better relations between North and South Korea. Kim was admitted to Seoul's Severance Hospital more than a month ago for pneumonia. Before winning the presidency, Kim struggled for decades as an opposition leader. A former political prisoner, he endured a suspected assassination attempt, a kidnapping, repeated arrests, beatings, exile and a death sentence. Shortly after taking office, Kim vigorously met political leaders of Western countries in a bid to gain support for his ""Sunshine Policy"" to establish relations with the North. Kim's policy of detente culminated when he met North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in June 2000, becoming the first South Korean leader to do so since the Korean War unofficially ended in 1953. But Kim left a mixed legacy as president. Although he helped pull South Korea out of a financial downward spiral, many of his promised economic reforms failed to materialize. A series of corruption scandals, including the imprisonment of two sons on graft charges, also tainted his tenure. ""Broadly speaking, his place in history is going to be a positive one,"" said Brian Bridges, a political science professor at Hong Kong's Lingnan University who specializes in politics and foreign policies of the two Koreas. ""While it is true that his presidency ended in a cloud of controversy ... he did have a very significant impact in two ways: He took over at a time when South Korea was on its knees and pulled it out from a tremendous economic downturn. And he helped in significantly changing public opinion and popular thinking of South Koreans toward North Korea."" Kim was born to middle-class farmers on Ha Enido, a small island in South Cholla province, but the family moved to the nearby port of Mokpo so Kim could complete high school. He began dabbling in anti-establishment politics while working in the shipping industry. After his fifth try for political office, Kim was elected to the National Assembly in 1961. One month later, Gen. Park Chung-hee seized control of the government in a military coup, launching Kim's career as a key opposition figure. The tough, authoritarian Park proved the perfect foil for the fiery oratory of the charismatic Kim. The more Park persecuted Kim, the more Kim's popularity grew. During the height of the Vietnam War in 1971, Kim proclaimed his liberal views on the reunification of North and South Korea. The government branded him a communist, but in his first presidential race he won 46 percent of the vote against Park. Kim was headed to a rally in Seoul a month after the election when a truck turned directly into the path of his car, forcing him off the road. The truck hit another vehicle, killing two people. Kim was left with a permanent limp from the incident, which was widely considered an assassination attempt. Park tightened his hold in 1972, scrapping the constitution and doing away with any pretense of democratic rule. Kim traveled to Japan for medical treatment and continued his anti-Park campaign. In August 1973, South Korean agents kidnapped Kim from a Tokyo hotel and took him out to sea in a small boat, on which he spent several harrowing days. When then-U.S. Ambassador Philip Habib was informed of the abduction, he warned Park that he would face severe repercussions from the United States if Kim were killed. Kim was returned to his Seoul home, battered but alive, and spent the next nine years under house arrest, in jail or in exile. In 1979 Park was assassinated by the head of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. Another general, Chun Doo-hwan, imposed martial law as he moved to take over the presidency. Kim and other leading opposition figures were arrested as tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Kwangju, in South Cholla province. Troops used force to quell the demonstrations, killing at least 200 people, by some estimates. Kim was charged with sedition and nearly executed, but again the United States intervened. Under a deal with then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration, Kim boarded a plane to the United States in 1982. When he returned to his homeland a few years later, however, the United States could not help him. As soon as he stepped off the plane in Seoul, Kim was knocked down by Korean security officers and dragged back into house arrest. Kim made two more failed bids for president -- in 1987 and 1992 -- before declaring that he was quitting politics. His retirement did not last long and he was elected president in 1997, at the height of the Asian economic crisis. His inauguration marked the first peaceful transfer of power between rival parties in 50 years. At the time of his inauguration, Korea was plunging headlong into a financial crisis. He told CNN then that he felt as though he was handed an empty vault. Kim called on global investors to have faith in his country's future -- and on his people to forge their own recovery. Thousands answered, trading in gold rings for cash as a symbol of their desire to revive their country. The watershed moment of Kim's presidency came in June 2000 when he met North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, grasping hands and beaming. But rapprochement talks between the countries hit a wall after conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008, with a tougher stance toward the North than Kim and his successor, Roh Moo-hyun. In an interview with CNN in 2006, Kim looked back on his long political life, secure in the belief that -- despite setbacks -- his convictions were worth fighting for. ""After I was sentenced to death, people from the military regime came up to me and said, 'If you cooperate with us, we will let you live. If you don't cooperate, you will die.' ""I said, 'If I compromise with you, I'll live temporarily, but I will die forever. If I do not cooperate with you, my body will be dead, but I will live in my people's heart and history forever. I rather choose to live in history forever.'"" CNN's Sohn Jie-Ae and Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.","Kim's ""Sunshine Policy"" with North culminated in 2000 meeting with Kim Jong Il .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" that attacked him during his presidency has been weakened, but continues to operate against President Obama, former President Clinton said Sunday. Former President Clinton said Republicans won't see a 1994-like surge at the polls in 2010. On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Clinton was asked about the term his wife Hillary Clinton, now secretary of state, famously coined. ""Is it still there?"" host David Gregory asked. ""Oh, you bet. Sure it is. It's not as strong as it was, because America's changed demographically, but it's as virulent as it was,"" the former president replied. ""I mean, they're saying things about him [Obama] -- you know, it's like when they accused me of murder and all that stuff they did,"" Clinton said, in an apparent reference to conspiracy theories surrounding the suicide of White House deputy counsel Vince Foster. ""It's not really good for the Republicans and the country, what's going on now,"" Clinton said. ""I mean, they may be hurting President Obama. They can take his numbers down, they can run his opposition up. But fundamentally, he and his team have a positive agenda for America."" The nation needs ""a credible debate about what's the right balance between continuing to expand the economy through stimulus and beginning to move back to fiscal balance,"" Clinton said. ""We need a credible debate about what's the best way to get to universal [health care] coverage."" Clinton was asked whether he is concerned that the 2010 midterm elections could resemble those of 1994, when Republicans took control of the House and Senate two years into his first term. ""There's no way"" that could happen, Clinton said, adding that ""the country is more diverse and more interested in positive action."" Also, he said, Republicans had control of Congress for several years under President George W. Bush, ""and they know the results were bad."" And, he said, ""the Democrats haven't taken on the gun lobby like I did.""

"HIGHLANDS COUNTY, Florida (CNN) -- At the heart of Florida researchers' high-tech efforts to protect black bears is a rather low-tech tool: day-old doughnuts. A young bear sits next to a pine tree after being snared by one of the traps set by researchers. Researchers use the doughnuts and other stale pastries to bait traps for the bears. Once snared, the bears are tranquilized and then fitted with a GPS collar. Using cell phone technology, every 15 minutes the collar sends a text message that tells researchers where the bear is located. Tracking the bears' movements -- or lack thereof -- is important. Dr. John Cox, head of the South-Central Florida Bear Project, said the bear population, in order to stay healthy, must be able to travel to different locations throughout the state. They need to travel between different bear populations. But that mobility has been decreasing. There was a time, Cox said, when the bears were free to roam the entire state. As development increased, however, the black bear lost much of its habitat. And the habitat that remained has become more fragmented due to development, primarily roads. The result: The bears become more isolated, with inbreeding within that isolated population. ""This population of bears is actually losing genetic diversity,"" Cox said. ""You see that loss of healthy genes in the population over time. ""That is a sign of isolation."" Having the bears wear the GPS collars is ""wonderful because the bears are telling us what habitat we need to protect,"" said Tricia Martin of The Nature Conservancy. As of now, 55 black bears in the area have been fitted with collars.  Watch the researchers at work » . Researchers want to know whether the bears' travels have them crossing a road, an orange grove, or somewhere else in order to get from place to place. Collecting data on the corridors the bears need to travel will help in pinpointing what land should be sought for conservation purposes. But first the bears must be snared -- and that's where the doughnuts come in. ""The doughnuts are a good bait, they can smell and it'll bring them in,"" said Wade Ulrey, one of the researchers with the South-Central Florida Bear Project. Recently a young female bear was found in a snare trap -- lured there by the doughnuts, or perhaps the brownie with whipped cream and a cherry that also had been placed there. Ulrey and fellow University of Kentucky research scientist Joe Guthrie slowly approached the trapped bear. The animal, with a cable around its paw, tried to climb a pine tree to escape.  See photos of a snared bear » . The researchers waited for the bear to calm down, then they injected her with a tranquilizer that was at the end of an 8-foot-long pole. As they waited for the drug to take effect, Ulrey and Guthrie returned to their truck to gather the tools they needed to examine the bear. ""We have a couple of bags of ice here to help keep her cool,"" Ulrey said as he placed the bags under the legs and arms of the unconscious bear. The team scanned the 2½-year-old and realized she already had a microchip implanted under her skin. ""It's similar to an ID system used for pets,"" said Ulrey. The chip tells the researchers that this bear was caught in 2007, when she was a cub still roaming Florida with her mother. The researchers weighed and measured the bear. Then Ulrey used tweezers to pull out a bit of hair. ""We can get a DNA sample from this to see if she is related to any other bears we've captured in the area,"" Ulrey said. This young black bear, however, won't be telling researchers where she will be traveling. She is too young to be outfitted with a GPS collar. Ninety minutes later, the tranquilizer wears off. The bear is awake and appears unharmed. ""Usually the things you'll see is a little bit of an abrasion where they've rubbed some of the fur off, or maybe a cut,"" Cox said when asked about the danger of using a snare trap. As this young cub wanders off, the research team can only hope she finds a road less traveled -- and stays off the highways.","Researchers in South Florida capture bears, outfit them with GPS collars .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police in east Jerusalem stretched into Sunday evening after a visit by a Jewish group to one of the city's holiest sites. Israeli border police charge towards Palestinian protesters during clashes in Jerusalem's Old City. Street battles began in the Old City on Sunday morning, when Palestinians praying at the site -- known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif, or ""Noble Sanctuary,"" and to Jews as Temple Mount -- began to throw rocks at the visiting Jews, said Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. Police responded with stun grenades and arrested eight demonstrators, he said. Rosenfeld also said two Palestinians and two police officers were wounded in the melee, but Sheikh Ikrima Sabri, a former grand mufti of Jerusalem, said nine Palestinians were hurt. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat called the visit a deliberate provocation by hardliners opposed to a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and criticized the police response to the protests. Erakat compared the visit to the 2000 trip by Ariel Sharon -- before he was elected prime minister -- to the al-Aqsa mosque that Palestinians blame for touching off three years of violence. ""We've seen this before, and we know what the consequences are,"" Erakat said in a statement issued Sunday evening. He said the visit was ""deliberately timed"" on the eve of the anniversary of Sharon's September 28, 2000 visit. There was no immediate response from the Israeli government to Erakat's statement. The demonstration was broken up about 1:30 p.m., but Palestinians continued battling police with rocks and Molotov cocktails for several hours in other parts of east Jerusalem. Erakat said Israel was ""deliberately escalating tensions"" in Jerusalem at the same time that U.S. President Barack Obama is trying to coax the two sides into restarting talks aimed a permanent settlement of the decades-old conflict. ""Providing a police escort for settlers who are against peace at all costs, and whose presence is deliberately designed to provoke a reaction, are not the actions of someone who is committed to peace, but of someone who will go to extraordinary lengths to scuttle all hopes of peace,"" Erakat said.

The U.S. government hadn't had a solid lead on al Qaeda's leader since the battle of Tora Bora in winter 2001. Although there are informed hypotheses that today he is in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province on the Afghan border, perhaps in one of the more northerly areas such as Bajaur, these are essentially guesses, not ""actionable"" intelligence. A longtime American counterterrorism analyst explained to me, ""There is very limited collection on him personally."" That's intelligence community shorthand for the fact that the usual avenues of ""collection"" on a target such as bin Laden are yielding little or no information about him. Those avenues typically include signal intercepts of phone calls and e-mails, as well as human intelligence from spies. Given the hundreds of billions of dollars that the ""war on terror"" has consumed, the failure to capture or kill al Qaeda's leader is one of its signal failures. Does it even matter whether bin Laden is found? Yes, it does. First, there is the matter of justice for the almost 3,000 people who died in the September 11 attacks and for the thousands of other victims of al Qaeda's attacks around the world. Second, every day that bin Laden remains at liberty is a propaganda victory for al Qaeda. Third, although bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri aren't managing al Qaeda's operations on a daily basis they guide the overall direction of the jihadist movement around the world, even while they are in hiding. Those messages from al Qaeda's leaders have reached untold millions worldwide via television, the Internet and newspapers. The tapes have not only instructed al Qaeda's followers to continue to kill Westerners and Jews, but some also carried specific instructions that militant cells then acted on. In March 2008, for instance, the al Qaeda leader denounced the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in a Danish newspaper as a ""catastrophe"" for which punishment would soon be meted out. Three months later, an al Qaeda suicide attacker bombed the Danish Embassy in Islamabad, killing six. Some reading this may think: But what's the proof that the al Qaeda leader is still alive? Plenty. Since September 11, bin Laden has released a slew of video and audiotapes, many of which discuss current events. After a nine-month silence, for instance, bin Laden released a 22-minute audiotape on March 14, sharply condemning the recent Israeli invasion of Gaza. Are these tapes real? Not one of the dozens of tapes released by bin Laden after 9/11 has been a fake. Indeed the U.S. government has authenticated many of them using bin Laden's distinctive voiceprint. And what about the persistent reports that he is ill? In 2002, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said bin Laden had kidney disease, for which he required a dialysis machine, and was therefore likely dead. But the stories of bin Laden's life-threatening kidney problems are false, judging by his appearance in videos that he released in 2004 and again in 2007, in which he showed no signs of illness. On the 2007 tape, the al Qaeda leader had even dyed his white-flecked beard black, suggesting that as the Saudi militant entered his fifth decade, he was not immune to a measure of vanity about his personal appearance. In fact, bin Laden looked much better in those videos than he did in the video he released shortly after the battle of Tora Bora in late 2001, where he had narrowly escaped being killed in a massive American attack. The situation is further complicated by the fact that bin Laden and al-Zawahiri are almost certainly hiding out in the tribal areas of Pakistan, on the Afghan border. Arthur Keller, a CIA officer who ran a spy network in Pakistan's tribal areas in 2006, told me the problems of working in the region: ""It's an incredibly remote area. They're hiding in a sea of people that are very xenophobic of outsiders, so it's a very, very tough nut to crack."" An additional factor operating in bin Laden's favor is the personal popularity he has long enjoyed in Pakistan. Three years after the September 11 attacks, for instance, a Pew poll found that al Qaeda's leader had a 65 percent favorability rating among Pakistanis. However, it is clear from the videos of bin Laden and al-Zawahiri that aired in the years since the attacks that they are not living in caves. In those tapes, both men's clothes were clean and well-pressed. Caves generally don't have laundry facilities. And the videos that they have released are well-lit and well-shot productions, suggesting access either to electrical outlets or to generators to run lights. Al-Zawahiri is often filmed in a library setting, and on one of his videos from March 2006, there are curtains clearly visible behind him, suggesting that the tape was shot in a house. By early 2008, the Bush administration had tired of the Pakistani government's unwillingness or inability to take out al Qaeda's leaders, and in July, the president authorized Special Operations forces to carry out ground assaults in the tribal regions without the permission of the Pakistani government. But in the face of the intense Pakistani opposition to American boots on the ground, the Bush administration chose to rely instead on drones to target suspected al Qaeda and Taliban leaders. Bush ordered the CIA to expand its attacks with Predator and Reaper drones. Between July 2008 and this month, U.S. drones have killed dozens of lower-ranking militants and at least 10 mid- and upper-level leaders within al Qaeda or the Taliban. This strategy seems to have worked, at least in terms of combating the ability of al Qaeda to plan or carry out attacks in the West. Law-enforcement authorities have uncovered no serious plots against U.S. or European targets that were traceable to militants who had received training in Pakistan's tribal regions after the drone program had been dramatically ramped up there. The increased pace of the American drone attacks in Pakistani's tribal areas was motivated in part by the hope that it would increase panicked communications among the militants, which might help pinpoint the locations of the top leaders in al Qaeda or the Taliban, but that approach has not paid off when it comes to bin Laden. If killing bin Laden with a drone has proved difficult, so too will be capturing him alive. His former bodyguard Abu Jandal told Al Quds al Arabi newspaper, ""Sheikh Osama gave me a pistol. ... The pistol had only two bullets, for me to kill Sheikh Osama with in case we were surrounded or he was about to fall into the enemy's hands, so that he would not be caught alive "" Should bin Laden be captured or killed, that would probably trigger a succession battle within al Qaeda. While al-Zawahiri is the deputy leader of the terror group and therefore technically bin Laden's successor, he is not regarded as a natural leader. Indeed, even among his fellow Egyptian militants, al-Zawahiri is seen as a divisive force, and so he is unlikely to be able to step into the role of leader of al Qaeda and of the world jihadist movement that is occupied by bin Laden. By the law of averages, eventually, bin Laden will be captured or killed. Yet the ideological movement that he helped spawn -- ""Binladenism"" -- will live on long after he is gone. That is bin Laden's legacy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen.","Peter Bergen: Osama bin Laden still inspires al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- Peter Gathungu walks more than a mile to a shopping center, where he pays a sizable sum to charge his cell phone. The solar phone is expected to be a great success in Kenya. That's because electricity is nonexistent in Gathungu's hometown of Njoro, in northwest Kenya. Landlines and other forms of communication are not as efficient, so Gathungu and millions of others in emerging nations rely on mobile phones. Charging the phones can be a headache in towns and villages where electricity is scarce. Gathungu's troubles may soon be over, though. Kenya's biggest mobile phone company, Safaricom Ltd., launched the nation's first solar-charged phone this month. The handset comes with a regular electrical charger and a solar panel that charges the phone using the sun's rays, company CEO Michael Joseph told CNN by telephone. Retailing at about $35, the phones were manufactured by Chinese telecommunications company ZTE Corp. Safaricom plans to make an initial supply of 100,000 phones available. ""People are excited about these phones,"" Joseph said. ""I expect to be sold out in a week."" Eco-friendly phones have been touted by several companies at global trade shows, but most have not been launched yet. Samsung unveiled a solar-powered phone at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, earlier this year and introduced its first sun-powered phone in India in mid-June. The company expects its Solar Guru model to perform well in India, another country where electrical supply can be erratic. Unlike many technological innovations, the solar phone is making its big splash in developing nations, where the need is the greatest. After the Solar Guru is in circulation in India, Samsung said, it plans to launch similar phones in other Asian markets, Europe and Latin America. For the time being, Kenyans are happy to serve as early adopters. ""The power crisis here has been going on for ages,"" Joseph said, adding that the Safaricom phone's solar panel is small and portable, unlike charging devices some Kenyans now use. Only about 1.3 million of Kenya's 37 million people are connected to the national electrical grid, said Migwi Theuri, a spokesman for Kenya Power and Lighting Co. The east African nation, which gets most of its energy from hydro-generation, has been undergoing power rationing after a three-year drought. Despite the limited availability of power, Kenya has one of the most vibrant cell phone markets in Africa, analysts say. An estimated 17 million Kenyans use mobile phones. Some charge phones on bicycle-run generators, Joseph said. Or like, Gathungu, they pay businesses in major cities to charge their phones, sometimes waiting an entire day. ""There's an enormous need for a device like this,"" Joseph said of the solar phone, which can charge during talk time, as long as there are rays. ""They will continue to charge on natural light, even on cloudy days,"" he added. Gathungu plans to buy one of the new environmentally friendly phones. For him, it's a matter of money and convenience. He earns 4,000 Kenya shillings ($53 dollars) a month as a waiter. Charging his phone for 50 shillings (70 cents) a week adds up. The solar phone would pay for itself, Gathungu said. Until he buys one, he'll keep making the trek to the shopping center every Sunday afternoon after church. He wouldn't go into further detail about his mobile phone woes, not wanting to waste his battery charge on the call.","Solar cell phone launched in Kenya this month, retailing at $35 per handset .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The British government announced Friday that more than 4,000 former Gurkha soldiers are entitled to settle in Britain, but Gurkha supporters quickly denounced the measure as meaningless. Former Gurkha solider Tulbahadur Pun was awarded Britain's highest honor for bravery, the Victoria Cross. Supporters have fought for years for more rights for the Gurkhas, Nepalese soldiers who have been part of the British Army for nearly 200 years. Gurkhas have fought alongside the British Armed Forces in every conflict in that period, including both world wars, and are known for their ferocity and pride. Despite their centuries of service, Gurkhas were not given the right to settle in the United Kingdom until 2004. And even then the order applied only to those discharged after the British handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, when the Gurkhas Brigade moved from Hong Kong to Britain. The government's announcement Friday applies to all Gurkhas, including those who left the army before 1997, if they meet one of five criteria. It also says around 6,000 of the Gurkhas' dependents may be able to apply for settlement in Britain as well. ""The guidance honors the service, commitment, and gallantry of those who served with the Gurkhas Brigade,"" Border and Immigration Minister Phil Woolas said in a written statement. The Gurkha Justice Campaign, however, said the government's criteria for the Gurkhas' resettlement are unrealistic and too difficult for many of the soldiers to meet. ""Only a tiny fraction of the Gurkhas who retired before 1997 will win settlement rights under the new policy,"" the campaign said. ""The campaign for full Gurkha justice will now be taken back into Parliament and the courts. The government needs to know they will have a huge campaign against them who will commit to righting this wrong."" The High Court ruled last September that the 1997 cut-off date was fair, but added that caseworkers needed revised guidance on deciding the cases of Gurkhas discharged before that date. Under the guidance, Gurkhas discharged before 1997 must meet one of five criteria to be considered for resettlement in Britain: . • Have three years' continuous residence in Britain, before or after service; • Have close family settled in the United Kingdom; • Have an award for gallantry, leadership, or bravery while in the brigade; • Have a chronic medical condition attributable to or made worse by army service; • Have served for 20 or more years. Actress Joanna Lumley, whose father served in the Gurkhas while she was a girl, has been an outspoken campaigner for their rights. She said the new criteria are harsher than she expected. ""They've given five bullet points which virtually cannot be met by the ordinary Gurkha soldier,"" Lumley told reporters Friday. ""This one page of criteria has taken the government four months to come up with. It has made me ashamed of our administration."" She said most Gurkhas are allowed to stay in the United Kingdom for only two years, so three years of continuous residence is not possible. Most Gurkhas, she said, also have not been allowed to settle in Britain with their families. The requirement for having won an award discriminates against the ordinary soldier who has no award, she said. ""This sends out not only to the Gurkha soldiers, but to our own men fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, the most appalling message: that unless you have been awarded a medal for gallantry, you're not a real soldier,"" Lumley said. Only officers are allowed to serve 20 or more years, she said, so most riflemen will not qualify for the service requirement. And proving that an injury is related to army service will be nearly impossible for most, she said. ""How on earth are men who were injured in the 1940s, '50s, '60s going to be able to prove that their long-term chronic illness is attributable to injures received during their service?"" she said. A Home Office spokesman said the government believes hundreds of Gurkhas will still be eligible to settle in Britain. ""We would not accept that,"" the spokesman said of Lumley's criticisms. ""We would say that the criteria as we see it is fair and balanced."" The Gurkha brigade originated in the 19th century with Nepalese soldiers who impressed British imperial troops with their ferocity and military ability. The first Gurkha units were formed in 1815. They saw action in both world wars and were fundamental to the British military maintaining control of India in the 1800s. Today there are 3,400 troops in the Gurkha brigade, operating from bases in Great Britain. Most recently, Gurkha troops were used in the Persian Gulf War and the Balkan conflicts.","British government unveils moves to let more former Gurkha troops live in the UK .

"(CNN) -- A Kentucky Chihuahua is expected to make a full recovery after a freak accident that left a large barbecue fork lodged in his head for days, according to the animal hospital where he was treated. During a family gathering two weeks ago, 12-week-old Smokey was waiting to be fed as his owner used the fork to shoo another dog away from Smokey's food, Su Smith, vice president of Cumberland Valley Animal Hospital in London, Kentucky, wrote in an article on the hospital's Web site. As owner Vickie Brumley of Manchester, Kentucky, waved the fork, the handle broke off and the fork end was flung through the air, embedding itself several inches into Smokey's head. Smokey immediately ran into the woods, Smith wrote. For two days, his owner's family searched for him despite bad weather and finally came to the conclusion that he had either died of his injury or been killed by wildlife. Brumley's brother, Hughie Wagers, was visiting his sister and sitting on the porch when Smokey came up the driveway with the fork still sticking out of his head, Smith wrote. He rushed him to the animal hospital. ""They arrived at 6:59 p.m., right as we were about to lock up,"" hospital staffer Michelle Duncum told CNN. ""Mr. Wagers walked into the hospital and asked if we could please help him."" Staffers were shocked when they saw Smokey, she said. ""We had never dealt with anything like this before."" Veterinarian Keaton Smith knew Smokey's treatment might be expensive and spoke with Wagers about options, Smith wrote. Keaton Smith offered to treat Smokey at the hospital's expense if Wagers allowed the hospital to call media outlets about the Chihuahua's story. However, staffers wanted to make sure Smokey would live through the night first before calling anyone, Su Smith said. It only took the veterinarian about 30 seconds to remove the fork from Smokey's head, Duncum said. And when the veterinarian arrived at the hospital the next morning, July 8, he found Smokey ""recovering much better than expected,"" Su Smith wrote. Smokey has been advised to take it easy for a few weeks, but is expected to fully recover, Duncum said. The Chihuahua's owner did not immediately return a call seeking comment from CNN. ""Dr. Smith asks everyone who believes this is a cruelty case to 'please back off' and stop jumping to unfounded conclusions,"" Su Smith wrote. ""If you have never had an accident of any kind, you may cast the first stone, but there will be no criminal charges filed in this case.""","Broken fork accidentally gets stuck in Chihuahua's head .

"(CNN) -- Spanish Primera Liga side Atletico Madrid have got one foot in the Champions League group stage after claiming a crucial 3-2 success at Greek side Panathinaikos in a tough qualifying round first leg encounter on Wednesday. Maxi Rodriguez celebrates scoring the opening goal in Atletico Madrid's 3-2 win in Greece. The visitors took a 1-0 lead in the 36th minute when Diego Forlan set up Maxi Rodriguez who took the ball around Panathinaikos goalkeeper Mario Galinovic to score. Panathinaikos levelled in the 47th minute when Dimitris Salpingidis, who had an earlier goal disallowed, flicked the ball over Atletico keeper Sergio Asenjo. However, Forlan restored the Spaniards' lead in the 63rd minute when he followed-up Rodriguez's blistering drive which had come back off the post. In-demand Argentine striker Sergio Aguero made it 3-1 in the 70th minute but Panathinaikos substitute Sebastian Leto closed the gap four minutes later to give the Greek side some hope. In the night's other matches, French side Lyon stormed closer to a 10th successive group stage appearance with a tumping 5-1 victory over Anderlecht. The Ligue 1 outfit had the match sewn up before half-time with Miralem Pjanic, a Lisandro Lopez penalty, Michel Bastos and Bafetimbi Gomis giving them a four-goal cushion. Anderlecht, beaten in Champions League qualifying for the last two seasons, pulled one back through Matias Suarez in the 58th minute, but Claude Puel's Lyon side restored their four-goal advantage inside five minutes with Gomis grabbing his second of the night. Swiss side FC Zurich took a giant step closer to playing in the competition for the first time in 28 years by claiming a 3-0 lead at Latvian side Ventspils. Goals from Johan Vonlathen, Sylvan Aegerter and Dusan Djuriuc look almost certain to put Zurich into the last 32 of the competition. Debrecen edged closer to becoming Hungary's first Champions League group stage participants since 1996 when they claimed a 2-1 advantage at Levski Sofia in Bulgaria. Laszlo Bodnar gave the Hungarians the lead but Levski levelled at the start of the second period with a fine strike from Cedric Bardon. However, 14 minutes from time, Peter Czvitkovics claimed Debrecen's winner. Israeli champions Maccabi Haifa were also winners on the road with a goal six minutes from time from substitute Shlomi Arbeitman earning a 2-1 win at Salzburg. Georgian striker Vladimer Dvalishvili headed Haifa in front before Alexander Zickler equalized on 57 minutes for the Austrians.","Atletico Madrid beat Panathinaikos 3-2 in Champions League qualifier first leg .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Strange lights in the sky, mysterious flashes, dozens of witnesses, a missing wind turbine blade and a tabloid splash featuring the pun: E.T. farm harm. The Sun tabloid newspaper's UFO splash. Let's hope there isn't intelligent life out there watching us. Britain's tabloid Sun newspaper Thursday proclaimed from its front page that a wind turbine was ruined after a UFO hit one of its 20 meter-long blades in Conisholme, Lincolnshire. Dorothy Willows, who lives near the damaged turbine, told The Sun she was in her car when she saw strange lights in the sky. ""The lights were moving across the sky towards the wind farm. Then I saw a low flying object. It was skimming across the sky towards the turbines."" Apparently, hours later, she and her husband were woken by a big bang; one of the turbine's three blades had gone. It, was, however, on the ground below. Other locals told the newspaper that the lights looked like ""balls of flames."" Russ Kellett, a UFO expert, told the newspaper: ""Balls of light were seen in the sky and the MoD [Ministry of Defence] has no explanation. It must have taken a pretty massive object. We are very, very, very excited."" However, The Guardian newspaper's Web site content director Emily Bell had a simple explanation for all those ""balls of light"" in the sky. She told The Guardian the lights were fireworks her brother Tim had bought at the local garden center for the 80th birthday party of dad Peter Bell. ""It was a medium-sized fireworks display with absolutely no ballistics, and the fireworks were mostly dropping over my parents' house. But we were laughing that we could have broken the wind turbine,"" Emily said. ""There we are in the middle of a scoop and we're beaten to it by a red-top tabloid,"" Emily's mother Bridget, 74, told The Guardian. Later Thursday, the British Press Association reported the blade may have come off after a mechanical failure. Fraser McLachlan, chief executive of GCube, which insures more than 25,000 wind turbines worldwide, told PA that although it was unusual, this kind of incident happened up to six times a year. ""It does happen that a blade will sometimes just come off a machine for one reason or another,"" he said. ""The main reason is the blade may shear. ""We don't normally see things like aircraft -- or UFOs -- hitting them. It's usually a mechanical failure that causes the blade to separate from the main hub."" He said the cold weather was another possible cause. Dr Peter Schubel, an expert in the design and manufacture of wind turbine blades at the University of Nottingham, agreed. He told the BBC that if the turbine blade was still, it would take a 10-tonne load to remove a blade, but if it was rotating the force could be a lot less. ""It's definitely not a bird. It could be ice thrown from a neighbouring turbine that struck it."" Aliens out of control or simple mechanical failure? A case for Mulder and Scully? What do you think?","British tabloid blames UFO for destroying wind turbine blade .

"(CNN)  -- Authorities have seized $1 billion worth of marijuana plants and have arrested 82 Mexican nationals with ties to drug cartels in the first week and half of an effort to eradicate marijuana fields from California's Fresno County, the county sheriff's office said Wednesday. The 82 suspects arrested so far have links to Mexican drug cartels. Operation Save Our Sierra began July 13 and involves local, state and federal agencies working together to remove marijuana growing operations, investigate and arrest drug traffickers, and remove infrastructure on public lands in Fresno County, a news release said. ""This is a high-intensity drug trafficking area,"" U.S. Drug Czar Gil Kerlikowske said in a phone interview. ""I think what should be highlighted here is the local authorities' work to reclaim the land from the drug traffickers."" The 82 suspects arrested so far have links to Mexican drug cartels, local authorities said, though they did not release further details. Eastern Fresno County, where the seizures have been made, is mountainous and sparsely populated. Growers exploit the area's streams, rivers and lakes to create elaborate drip lines for their plants. A mature plant can be worth $4,000, said Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims. ""Fresno County is roughly the size of Connecticut, and the drug traffickers target these areas because they know there is not that significant of a law-enforcement presence,"" Mims said. ""The chances of getting caught are slim."" ""The bottom line is our public lands are being destroyed by foreign drug trafficking and heavily armed Mexican cartels,"" George Anderson of the U.S. Department of Justice said Wednesday at a news conference highlighting the seizures. The operation is the largest in Fresno County history and one of the largest in California, Mims said. ""What makes this operation unique is the approach: prevention, enforcement, eradication and reclamation,"" she said. Intelligence gathered for the operation began in February, with community presentations about prevention. The effort is now focused on shutting down the at least 70 marijuana farms identified by local authorities. The operation is expected to continue into November, when colder weather makes marijuana growing more difficult. At least 330,000 marijuana plants have been seized, Mims said. ""This shows what can be accomplished at the local level when agencies work together,"" Kerlikowske said. Kerlikowske, who flew to Fresno County on Wednesday and toured a marijuana farm, said his office is one of the primary sponsors of the operation.","The U.S. drug czar says it is a high-intensity drug trafficking area .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have identified both people who died after being swept away by fierce waves churned up by Hurricane Bill on the East Coast. Tourists watch waves crash ashore at Acadia National Park in Maine on Sunday. Clio Axlerod, 7, of New York, died after a wave knocked her and six other people into the Atlantic at Maine's Acadia National Park on Sunday, Park Chief Stuart West said. Of the other six who were swept from that park into the ocean, four made it back to shore on their own. Two -- Axlerod's father, Peter Axlerod, 55, and Simone Pelletier, 12, of Belfast, Maine -- were rescued by the Coast Guard, he said. The victims were among several thousand people who were at the park late Sunday morning to watch the high waves that Bill -- then a Category 1 hurricane -- was producing. iReport.com: See photos shot before tragic wave incident . The people knocked into the water were on a rock cliff about 20 feet above the sea, West said. A wave struck at about 11: 50 a.m., pushing water onto the ankles of some of the people standing on ""top of what we think would be a safe area,"" West said. People started to turn back, but then they were hit by a larger wave, which sent the seven into the sea, West said. Some people were taken to a hospital with broken bones or other injuries, according to Sheridan Steele, the park's superintendent. A witness, Mary Ellen Martel of Maine, said that before the seven were swept into the ocean, people were clapping and laughing when the wind would bring the spray over. ""It was a very festive atmosphere,"" Martel said in a telephone interview. ""It was a warm, sunny day and everyone was just enjoying the show that Mother Nature was offering, but not everybody knows to stay away from the edge -- or way, away from the edge."" Martel, who had come to the park with her husband, said she feels ""pretty certain"" she had been on the same ledge as some of the victims who were swept to shore. Martel had stood far enough back that the first wave did not affect her much, but when she saw the second coming, she turned her back to protect a camera she had. She was doused from her shoulders down, and she went for the road that led away from the area, she said. ""When I looked [back], everybody was scrambling to get off the ledge,"" she said. Angel Rosa, 54, had come with family to Bethune Beach, one of Volusia County's 40 miles of beaches, Petersohn said. Although lifeguards had warned people not to go in the water because the offshore wind built waves to between 10 and 13 feet tall, Petersohn said, he suspects that's exactly why Rosa was in the water. ""I have a feeling he probably came over to body surf these huge waves,"" he said. He added that such waves come along only every few years. Rosa entered the water Saturday afternoon with a group, but was separated from them, Petersohn said. His fellow swimmers reported Rosa missing, he said, and as rescue teams were mobilizing, beach patrol received an emergency call that a man had been dragged to shore a half-mile away. Petersohn said Rosa might have suffered some kind of trauma that contributed to his drowning. Emergency personnel treated three spinal injuries during the weekend, Petersohn said, as the tough waves slammed swimmers into the bottom. An autopsy report on Rosa is expected in coming days. ""It's very unfortunate that this happened, and everyone feels terrible about it, but it's not something I'm surprised about,"" Petersohn said. ""As big as the surf was, as treacherous as it was, it doesn't surprise me."" Bill was downgraded to a tropical storm and then to an unnamed storm Monday as it headed into the northern Atlantic. The storm was expected to be in the British Isles by midweek, according to a forecast map from the National Hurricane Center. CNN's Khadijah Rentas contributed to this report.","Girl who died after being swept into Atlantic Ocean off Maine identified .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Satirical TV anchorman Stephen Colbert may not have a dog in this fight, but his name alone may have helped a Pomeranian-Chihuahua mix puppy beat a 6-year-old Cavalier King Charles spaniel. Stephen Colbert el dos rips the prize away from Mozart in the weekly competition. In the online doggie beauty pageant, the canine Steven Colbert el dos won the latest weekly semifinal, which enables him to compete for a $1 million grand prize. Colbert el dos from Georgia beat Mozart, or MoMo as he's known to his family and friends in New Orleans, Louisiana, to win cutest dog of the week. ""While it certainly would have been a lot of fun for MoMo to win this past week, we're excited for Stephen Colbert el dos and his owners. What a fun and entertaining ride it's been so far."" said  piano teacher Cara McCool, MoMo's owner. ""We're just happy for the attention this has brought to our charities as well as others supported by so many cute dogs in this competition,"" McCool said. Her charities included:  Redeemer Presbyterian Disaster Relief, Desire Street Ministries, Louisiana Teachers Save Our Students fund, Cavalier Rescue USA, Musical Arts Society of New Orleans, the Louisiana SPCA, and Teach for America. Colbert el dos' winnings are pledged to attract a stork to his owners' house. The owners, Bryan and his wife, Allyson, are newlyweds and are hoping to use the prize money for in vitro fertilization treatments to start a family. Colbert el dos' owners asked not to have their last names published to protect their privacy. There is some controversy over the weekly contest results. When the polls closed on Saturday at midnight Pacific time, Mozart was up by 131 votes. But on Monday the competition posted a message on its blog saying Mozart's fans had cheated. ""Mozart obviously worked very hard to receive over 4,500 valid votes in Week 8, but it's unfortunate that the judges had to remove 428 votes due to excessive voter accounts.""  The Cutest Dog Competition Web site, run by the All American Pet Brands, also said, ""there is no evidence that Mozart's owner had any part in the creation of these fraudulent accounts. Colbert's votes showed no signs of cheating."" More than 60,000 people have uploaded photos of their adorable dogs to the contest's Web site. Voters have to register an e-mail account with the competition. The rules state only one vote per e-mail address per day. ""The fraudulent accounts, with e-mail addresses only one number apart, were all created on the same days, from the same computers, and all votes cast from these 70-plus accounts were received within one minute of each other from the same computers (which generally means the owner of these accounts simply logged off and logged back onto another account to vote again),"" according to the competition Web site. Bryan said he was shocked when he found out on Monday his dog had won. ""On Saturday night, I went to bed and we were down 150 votes,"" he said. ""I know they announced the winners on the blog and I saw winner for Week 8 and I was expecting to see Mozart and I saw Stephen Colbert el dos and I just couldn't believe it."" He said it was a great day for the 7-month-old puppy and his owners. Their four-legged family includes three other dogs, all rescues, but they bought Colbert el dos from Puppies Galore in Lawrenceville, Georgia. When they met him, he was 2 months old, barely weighed a pound and would not eat. The manager of the store said the puppy was regressing after he was separated from his siblings. Now Stephen Colbert el dos is eating well and, ""He's as hyper as any puppy you'll see,"" Bryan said. Last week, they entered the competition and said they only told a few friends and family members. They posted a note on a Stephen Colbert fan site and support for the pooch went viral. A Web site said Colbert el dos had an invitation to appear on the ""Colbert Report"" if he made the top 12. Bryan said the TV show has not contacted them. Renata Luczak, a spokesperson for Comedy Central, could not confirm or deny the pet's booking, saying the ""Colbert Report"" ""refrains from commenting on upcoming guests appearing on the show."" Colbert el dos' owners denied having anything to do with the fraudulent votes for Mozart. ""We did not vote for Mozart a single time. And neither did anyone we know. Definitely no way,"" Bryan said. The human comedian Colbert has wreaked havoc in other online competitions, from a Hungarian bridge-naming contest to a NASA competition to name a room in the international space station. In both cases, Colbert won the popular vote. Hungary declined to name the bridge after Colbert. NASA, instead of naming the room in his honor, sent a treadmill to space with the Colbert honorific. In those contests, the competitions received heavy promotion during the show, with Colbert urging his viewers to participate. In the dog photo fight, Colbert had an impact without direct participation. MoMo was automatically re-entered in the competition for this week. Over the next four weeks, four more dogs will have a chance to be voted into the semifinals.

"(CNN) -- An 18-year-old suspect in Tuesday's bus-stop shootings that wounded seven people in Detroit, Michigan, surrendered to authorities Wednesday, police said. Detroit's deputy police chief called Tuesday's shootings ""a travesty."" Detroit Police Chief James Barren said Jamall Turner is one of two suspects in the shootings, which occurred at a bus stop near Cody High School after summer-school classes had ended for the day. Two men got out of a green minivan and ""fired multiple shots at a group of teens waiting on a bus,"" he said. Police were investigating rumors from witnesses that the shootings were gang-related. Officials said Tuesday that the gunmen asked for a person by name before shooting, getting back into their vehicle and fleeing. A third person was waiting in the minivan to aid in their escape, he said. Police have impounded two vehicles matching the van's description but do not know whether either was actually involved in the crime, he said. On Tuesday, police took another person into custody in an arrest that was not related to the shootings, ""but we believe that the arrested individual may shed light on the bus-stop shooting,"" he said. Deputy Police Chief James W. Tolbert said three of the victims remained hospitalized Wednesday with wounds that were not life-threatening. He said police believe that semiautomatic handguns were used. ""Any time there is a shooting and we have young people shot, it's a travesty,"" he said. ""We have to get our youth to understand that conflict resolution isn't picking up a gun."" Tolbert added that the police are instituting a ""safe-routes-to-school program.""","Jamall Turner is one of two suspects in the shootings .

"(CNN)  -- Police in San Mateo, California, said Monday that ""a potentially very drastic event"" at a high school was averted when school personnel subdued a former student who walked into the school armed with pipe bombs, a chainsaw and a 2-foot-long sword. At least 1,200 students and faculty were evacuated from the northern California school. ""It had the potential to be a catastrophic incident,"" said police Lt. Mike Brunicardi, describing the incident in which two pipe bombs exploded and at least 1,200 students and faculty were evacuated from the Northern California school. No one was injured in the incident, police said. Brunicardi said a 17-year-old former student wearing a nylon vest packed with 10 homemade pipe bombs entered Hillsdale High School in San Mateo about 8 a.m. Monday. He detonated two devices, with smoke setting off the school's fire-alarm system, before two teachers confronted him. ""The suspect was quickly wrestled down by a teacher who, with the help of the principal and another teacher, were able to hold him down until police arrived minutes later,"" Brunicardi said. The suspect's intentions were not clear, police said. ""He's being interviewed right now, but we don't have his specific motives at this time,"" Brunicardi said, adding that while the explosive power of the pipe bombs was not immediately known, the teachers who subdued the suspect put themselves in jeopardy. ""We are relieved that no one was injured and it's fortunate that we were able to apprehend the student before he hurt himself or anyone else,"" said San Mateo School District Associate Superintendent Kirk Black said. Authorities said the suspect, whose name was not immediately released, had been a student at the school in 2008.

"(CNN) -- The skeletal remains of two infants were found underneath a rural Texas trailer, police said Monday, in the same area where another set of infant remains was found last year. The skeletal remains of two infants were found near a Texas trailer, police said Monday. Authorities were called about 3:30 p.m. Sunday to the trailer south of Kennedale, about 15 miles southeast of Fort Worth, Texas, in rural Tarrant County, said Terry Grisham, spokesman for the Tarrant County Sheriff's Office. There is a group of about five mobile homes there, he said, that are leased by the property owner. One of the mobile homes had recently become vacant, and the owner was cleaning it up, Grisham said. The owner pulled back the metal ""skirt"" around the bottom of the mobile home and was ""digging around in there,"" and found a plastic bag, Grisham said. When the man opened it up, he found a box, and inside the box he found the ""bones of a very young infant,"" Grisham told CNN. He continued to look, and found another plastic container with more remains inside, of a ""similar-aged infant,"" before calling 911, Grisham said. In 2008, the same man called police to report that he had found a suitcase in the same area, in an overgrown field a distance away from the mobile homes, while dumping leaves. When he used a knife to cut into the suitcase, a set of infant bones were found, Grisham said. The medical examiner's office was unable to determine a cause of death because the remains were skeletal, although no bones were broken, he said. ""We worked the thing as best we could, without any more to go on than we had,"" but the investigation stalled, Grisham said. Police have contacted the two people -- a brother and sister -- who recently moved out of the trailer, he said. The two have been cooperative with authorities, he said. They were interviewed separately, but both told police they had no idea the remains were there, Grisham said. Authorities and the medical examiner's office remained at the scene Monday, Grisham said, and plan to use cadaver dogs at the site Monday afternoon in an effort to determine whether more remains were present. ""This ground is pretty brushy and overgrown,"" he said. A county work crew was brought in to carefully cut down the brush to aid the search, he said.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Punctuality was one of Debbie Hooper's best traits. Authorities sort through the wreckage thought to be Debbie Hooper's car. She went missing September 20. The 44-year-old grandmother from Whitesburg, Georgia, was always on time for her play dates with her baby granddaughter. She was always on time picking up her 15-year-old son from school. So when Hooper, who juggled two jobs to support her family, didn't appear at her dispatch job for a transportation company last Monday morning, her daughter Jessica Bartke, 19, knew something was wrong. Her mother's cell phone went straight to voicemail. Co-workers hadn't seen the bubbly, kindhearted woman with curly brown hair and a magnetic presence. ""She's always at work,"" said Bartke, who lives in Winston, Georgia, about 10 minutes from her mother's home. ""She was never lazy. I knew something had to be wrong."" Nearly a week after the torrential downpours that left the metro Atlanta area drenched, authorities are still searching for Hooper's body, which was last believed to have been in the Dog River in Douglas County, west of Atlanta. Late Monday afternoon, authorities discovered a female body in the Dog River Reservoir, said Brad Robinson, chief deputy of the Carroll County Sheriff's Office. They are waiting for lab work to identify the body, which is expected to be released Tuesday afternoon. Six flood-related deaths already have been reported in Douglas County. Bartke believes her mother went missing Sunday, September 20, the eve of her 44th birthday. Last Friday, when the water ebbed, a search crew of nearly 25 law enforcement officers from Carroll and Douglas counties uncovered Hooper's vehicle, a Jeep Liberty, stuck in the water in the Dog River. The team also recovered Hooper's purse. ""It was like putting an ant in front of the fire hose,"" said Sheriff Phil Miller of the Douglas County Sheriff's Office. ""The little Jeep Liberty looked like it had been put in a crusher and beat into pieces."" The following Saturday morning, more than two dozen authorities and four cadaver dogs continued to search the Dog River area. Miller said the water flow had been constant, which means the body could have drifted into the Chattahoochee River. Hooper remains the last missing flood victim in the Atlanta area, but in Tennessee, a man who disappeared after swimming in an overflowing ditch on a dare is still missing. This month's storm has been one of the worst in Southeastern U.S. history. The death toll in Georgia and Alabama has risen to 10. Gov. Sonny Perdue has declared a state of emergency in 17 flood-stricken counties, and State Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine estimated that the flooding has caused $250 million in losses. Bartke, Hooper's daughter, has taken her 15-year-old brother into her home. She says they are both distressed about not knowing where their mother may be. ""We talked every day,"" Bartke said. ""We spoke to each other even if we were busy, even if it was for two seconds just to say 'Mom, I love you. I'm busy right now, but I will call you back.'

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Veterans Administration's handling of disability claims has seen improvements and setbacks, a congressional watchdog said Wednesday. Sen. Daniel Akaka says, ""Our goal is to provide veterans with accurate and timely resolution to their cases."" ""Over the past several years, VA disability claims workloads at both the initial and appellate levels have improved in some areas and worsened in others,"" the Government Accountability Office said in a report. The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee asked the GAO to present its preliminary findings on the processing of disability claims, which were under discussion at a committee hearing. ""Our goal is to provide veterans with accurate and timely resolution to their cases,"" said Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, the committee's chairman. Ranking member Sen. Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, said, ""For the men and women who have served and sacrificed for our nation, they deserve a system that meets their needs without hassles or delays."" Along with a GAO representative, the hearing invited testimony from the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs, a professor and an official from the Disabled American Veterans. The GAO report said the number of initial claims the VA annually completes has increased from the 1999 to 2008 fiscal years. But it says the number of pending claims at year's end has grown during the same time period. The review cites ""increases in disability claims received, growing complexity of claims, court decisions and changes in regulation."" There have been mixed results for claims workloads at the appellate level. The number of resolved claims has increased from 2003 to 2008, but it took an average 96 days longer to resolve appeals during that same time period. ""One factor that affects workloads at the appellate level is the submission of new evidence or claims that must be evaluated,"" the report said. The report said the VA has worked to improve the handling of claims but said the results of those efforts ""is not yet known."" It mentions an increase in staff from 2005 to 2009, ""which has helped to increase the total number of decisions VA issues annually."" At the same time, training and staff integration challenges could cause a ""short-term"" decline in productivity . ""In addition, VA has established 15 resource centers to which it redistributes claims and appeals for processing from backlogged regional offices. Although VA has not collected data to evaluate the effect of its workload redistribution efforts, these efforts may ultimately increase the timeliness and consistency of VA's decisions,"" the report said. The VA is starting a pilot program with the Pentagon ""to perform joint disability evaluations that has the potential to streamline the disability process for prospective veterans."" The VA also is reviewing other potential programs -- ""targeting certain claims for fast-track processing and leveraging technology.""","VA's handling of disability claims has seen improvements, setbacks, review finds .

"(CNN) -- Roman Polanski is regarded as one of the finest directors of his generation, winning an Oscar for ""The Pianist"" and nominations for ""Tess"" and ""Rosemary's Baby,"" but he is probably as equally well known for his own tumultuous life. Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate are pictured together in London in the 1960s. Polanski, who was arrested Saturday in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant stemming from a decades-old sex charge, had lived in France for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the United States. The 76-year-old declined to collect his Academy Award for Best Director in person when he won it for ""The Pianist"" in 2003. He was en route to the Zurich Film Festival, which is holding a tribute to him, when he was arrested by Swiss authorities, the festival said. Polanski was put in ""provisional detention"" and now faces the possibility of being extradited to the U.S., where a warrant for his arrest was issued in 1978. The director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, acknowledging he had sex with a 13-year-old girl, but fled the U.S. before he could be sentenced. Polanski was accused of plying the girl, then known as Samantha Gailey, with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts, including intercourse, with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson's house. He was 43 at the time. Nicholson was not at home, but his girlfriend at the time, actress Anjelica Huston, was. According to a probation report contained in the filing, Huston described the victim as ""sullen."" ""She appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25. She did not look like a 13-year-old scared little thing,"" Huston said.  Watch as filmmakers rally round Polanski » . She added that Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl. ""I don't think he's a bad man,"" she said in the report. ""I think he's an unhappy man."" Polanski was born in Paris in 1933 of Polish-Jewish parents. Aged three, he and his family returned to Krakow in his father's native Poland. After the Nazis invaded his parents were sent to concentration camps: his mother was gassed at Auschwitz although his father survived the war. The young Polanski survived the Krakow ghetto and ""soared out of Poland on sheer personality,"" according to director Marina Zenovich, whose 2007 documentary ""Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,"" paints a sympathetic picture of the exiled movie legend. Growing up in war-torn Poland, the young Polanski found comfort in the cinema and in acting in radio dramas, on stage and in films. In 1962, Polanski directed his first feature-length film, ""Knife in the Water."" Poorly received in Poland it was a sensation in the West, and won an Academy Award nomination as Best Foreign Film.  See images of Polanski's life on cellulloid » . He later moved to England, co-starring with American actress Sharon Tate, whom he married in 1968, in the Hammer horror parody, ""Dance of the Vampires/The Fearless Vampire Killers, or Pardon Me But Your Teeth Are in My Neck."" Following his move to Hollywood, Polanski was at his peak: he was one of the hottest directors thanks to the critical and commercial hit Rosemary's Baby and he was married to the beautiful Tate. ""At a certain point in his life, Roman Polanski had a lot of hope,"" Zenovich told TIME magazine in 2008. ""He was living this great life. He was so talented and everyone wanted to work with him."" But that hopeful period ended when Tate, eight months' pregnant, was murdered by followers of Charles Manson in 1969. According to TIME, Polanski spent the first years after her death on a kind of sexual spree, and began spending time with younger and younger women, like 15-year-old Nastassja Kinski. When Polanski was arrested for assaulting Gailey, his case drew the attention of Judge Laurence J. Rittenband, who had earlier presided over Elvis Presley's divorce, Marlon Brando's child-custody battle and a paternity suit against Cary Grant. Rittenband, in a manner reminiscent of the one-liner-dropping judge in the Anna Nicole Smith case, was obsessed with the media. He even had a bailiff maintain a scrapbook of his newspaper clippings, according court filings. The case proceeded in a strange manner. Rittenband, who is now dead, first sent the director to maximum-security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing. Then, on the eve of his sentencing, the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days. The judge's bizarre behavior might have continued had Polanski not fled to France, where he has lived for the last 30 years, ultimately marrying again and having two children. Polanski has continued to make critically acclaimed films, such as ""Tess,"" an adaptation of the Thomas Hardy novel ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles"" which tells the story of a beautiful country girl (Nastassja Kinski) who is seduced by an older man. In 1981, he returned to Poland to direct and star in a stage production of ""Amadeus."" And 2002's ""The Pianist,"" re-established Polanksi as a top-flight director. There have been repeated attempts to settle the sex case over the years, but the sticking point has always been Polanski's refusal to return to attend hearings. Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who ""drugged and raped a 13-year-old child."" Polanski's lawyers tried earlier this year to have the charges thrown out, but a Los Angeles judge rejected the request. In doing so, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court. Espinoza also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way the director's case was handled years ago. Polanski's victim is among those calling for the case to be thrown out. Now married and known as Samantha Geimer, she filed court papers in January saying, ""I am no longer a 13-year-old child. I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim, have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception. ""Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court, great focus is made of me, my family, my mother and others. That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety, the continuation of the case."" Geimer, now 45, and a mother of three, sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement. She long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly, she said, because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled. Polanski was arrested two days after one of his wife's killers died. By her own admission, Susan Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, stabbing the 26-year-old actress 16 times. Polanski was filming in Europe at the time. Atkins, 61, died Thursday. She had been suffering from terminal brain cancer.","Polanski born in France in 1933. Moved to Poland and survived Holocaust .

Obama said he hoped the incident in Cambridge, which quickly spiraled into a national and racially charged controversy, ""ends up being what's called a teachable moment"" for the country. The president acknowledged that he had contributed to ""ratcheting it up"" by declaring the Police Department had ""acted stupidly"" even though he didn't know all the facts of the case and is a personal friend of Gates. Cambridge police called on Obama to apologize for the remark. Obama did not apologize, but in the phone call with Crowley he said his choice of words was ""unfortunate.""

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Raul Flores thought federal agents had barged with guns drawn into his home in Arivaca, Arizona, in the middle of the night. Shawna Forde, 41, denies involvement in the shooting deaths of an Arizona man and his daughter. The woman and two men wore uniforms and identified themselves as U.S. Marshals. They claimed the house was surrounded. They said they were looking for an escaped prisoner, Flores' wife told a 911 dispatcher. But there was no backup waiting outside, and no fugitive. The marshals were imposters. They had targeted Flores because they suspected he was a drug trafficker and they wanted to rob and kill him, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Department. As the intruders searched his home, Flores asked one of the men why his handgun was taped. The man responded by shooting and killing Flores. ""Someone just came in and shot my daughter and husband,"" Flores' wife frantically told 911. She tells the police operator that she was shot and left for dead with her husband, Raul Flores, 29, and daughter Brisenia, 9, who were both shot in the head. Police are not releasing the woman's name to protect her identity. But her 911 call, released to the media by the Pima County Sheriff's Department, tells the story of a deadly home invasion by a rogue band of impostors. As she describes the initial attack, the intruders return to the house. The door can be heard opening. ""They are coming back in! They are coming back in!"" the caller screams. She has armed herself with her husband's handgun. ""Get the f--- out,"" she barks. The order is followed by the explosive sound of gunfire traded as the wounded woman and her would-be killers fire on each other. A man -- one of the intruders -- is hit and groans loudly. The attackers retreat and leave the woman alive and alone with her slain family.  Hear gunfire on the 911 call » . Twelve days later police have the ""marshals"" in custody on charges of first-degree murder, burglary and aggravated assault. Police identified the suspects as Shawna Forde, 41, of Buena Vista, Arizona; Jason Eugene Bush, 34, of Kingman, Arizona; and Albert Robert Gaxiola, 42, of Tucson, Arizona. As police put her into a car, Forde told reporters, ""I did not do it."" The Pima County public defender's office, which represents Forde, Bush and Gaxiola, did not return CNN's calls requesting comment. Authorities from five different police departments in three states are investigating crimes allegedly involving the trio. Forde's arrest has had even greater reverberations across a community of private citizens who believe the government is not adequately protecting the nation's borders. Forde was a one-time member of the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps, a citizens group whose self-described mission is to secure the U.S. border, before she started her own smaller border enforcement organization. The accusations against her have given more fuel to Minutemen critics who say the groups dangerously blur the lines between law enforcement and vigilantism. Forde was well known in anti-immigration circles. She ran a failed campaign for City Council in her hometown of Everett, Washington, that touted her connections to the Minutemen. She posted videos on YouTube of her border patrols and was an outspoken fixture at Minutemen Washington meetings and rallies in Washington state. But even among this gung-ho group of self-styled border warriors, Forde was extreme, both Minutemen members and their critics agreed. Washington human rights advocate Luis Moscoso said he had a run-in with Forde during a protest he attended at a 2007 Minutemen conference in Bellingham, Washington. While other Minutemen engaged in a dialogue, Moscoso remembered Forde shouting insults at the protesters. Moscoso later was shocked, he said, to find his photograph and address on Forde's Web site. ""It wasn't a bull's-eye but it was close enough,"" he said. The Web site was taken down after the arrests, so CNN cannot independently confirm Moscoso's account. Eventually, Forde's tactics alienated even the most stalwart proponents of border security. ""The screaming, hollering, calling names, we don't do that,"" said outgoing Washington state Minutemen president Joseph Ray. ""She broke standard operating procedure too many times, she was too damn unreliable."" The Minutemen kicked Forde out of their ranks in 2007, Ray said. Around the same time, police said, Forde became embroiled in several bizarre incidents that remain under investigation in Everett. Forde's then-husband was shot in the abdomen by an unknown male assailant at their home. The couple later divorced. Forde next said she was the victim of a sexual assault. Later, Forde was found wounded in an alley where she told police she had been shot in the arm by an attacker. Speaking to the media about the attacks, Forde said she was being targeted by Mexican drug cartels for her work guarding the border. According To Sgt. Robert Goetz, spokesman for the Everett Police Department, Forde's sister and mother told police something very different. They believed she invented or played a part in the violence against her and her family. Cast out from the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps, Forde formed her own organization called the Minutemen American Defense. Chuck Stonex was a member. Despite ""her cloudy reputation"" in Minutemen circles, Stonex said, he and Forde got along well. Still, he said he noticed during an operation monitoring the border in Arizona with her in 2008 that Forde was well funded for the leader of a tiny group on the fringe of the Minutemen movement. ""She always had a lot of cash,"" he said. Cash was what led Forde, Bush and Gaxiola to Raul Flores' house on May 30, 2009, said Dawn Barkman, a spokeswoman for the Pima County Sheriff. Flores had a reputation for involvement in the narcotics trade along the border, Barkman said, and Forde devised a plan to bluff her way into his home and rob and kill him to finance her border patrol group. According to Barkman, it was Forde's plan but Bush allegedly fired the fatal shots inside the Flores home. It was not Bush's first slaying, police say. After his arrest in the shooting of Raul Flores, police in Wenatchee, Washington, charged Bush with the fatal stabbing of Hector Manuel Lopez Partida. Homeless and traveling through Wenatchee, Lopez Partida was killed in 1997, stabbed seven times, apparently as he slept on the ground next to a grain silo. Police in Wenatchee found a blood-soaked shirt near where Lopez was killed. Eight years later, advances in forensics testing indicated that Bush's DNA was on the shirt, a police affidavit said. Bush has ""long-standing ties to Aryan Nations groups,"" the affidavit said, and he allegedly bragged to an unidentified police informant about killing ""a Mexican,"" saying he and another man ""stomped"" and ""stabbed"" the man and ""left [him] to bleed out."" After the shooting at Flores' home, the crime wave continued, police said. A couple who are friends of Forde's mother was robbed at gunpoint of their $12,000 inheritance by men pretending to be U.S. Marshals, said Sgt. John Hubbard of the Shasta County Sheriffs Department. The victims, Hubbard said, identified Bush as one of the gunmen. Hubbard said police believe Forde helped carry out the robbery. In the next town over, Hubbard said, the home belonging to Forde's brother was robbed on the same day. The alleged crime spree leaves Forde's former compatriots feeling exposed and under attack. Stonex said he last saw Forde and Bush right after the shootout at the Flores home. Stonex helped patch a bullet wound to Bush's calf. ""They said they were jumped by border bandits,"" he said. He said had he known about their alleged killing of Flores and his daughter, Stonex would never have had anything to do with Forde. Now, he said, he and other Minutemen have been forced to cancel border patrol operations and wait for the scrutiny to die down.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- They're paid to watch for suspicious activity, to prevent bloody attacks. But employees at Baghdad's surveillance center often watch helplessly as death and destruction unfold before their eyes, on camera. Security cameras watch the streets of Baghdad, but the center's director says it has a long way to go. The center was set up a year and a half ago, with employees on the lookout for trouble, as police officers in a back room listen to the traffic on their radios. But there are not enough cameras to cover all of Baghdad -- only 5 percent of the city is surveilled under the current system. The cameras picked up suspicious activity last Wednesday, but within 20 seconds -- before any action could be taken -- a truck blew up in front of the Foreign Ministry building. By day's end, bombings had killed nearly 100 people in the city. The fledgling security surveillance operation has a long way to go, its director acknowledges. The center is understaffed and not yet open around the clock.  Watch security camera video of attacks » . Though overall attacks have decreased in Iraq, the images on screen serve as undeniable evidence of the ongoing violence the Iraqi government is struggling to prevent.

After last week's bombings -- which made Wednesday the bloodiest day in Iraq since U.S. combat troops withdrew from Iraqi cities at the end of June -- the center's managers met with Iraqi security forces in an effort to increase the number of cameras. ""We should all admit responsibility for this major breach of security,"" the director said. ""And we have to fix the system.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court will decide whether it is cruel and unusual punishment for young criminal offenders to be sentenced to life in prison with parole. Joe Sullivan, now 33, was convicted of burglary and rape when he was 13. He is serving life without parole. The justices agreed without comment Monday to accept appeals from two Florida inmates convicted as teenagers of criminal offenses. Oral arguments will be heard in the fall. One of the men is Joe Sullivan, 33, serving a life term without the possibility of parole in a Florida prison while confined to a wheelchair. He was sentenced for a rape committed when he was 13. The man's lawyers say he is one of only two people his age in the world who was tried as an adult and sentenced to ""die in prison"" for a non-homicide. The justices also accepted a case dealing with Terrance Graham, who was 17 when he took part in a violent home-invasion robbery while on parole for another felony. Outside a death-penalty context, the high court has offered little recent guidance on how to treat the youngest of underage criminal defendants. The appellate record for rapists younger than 15 is almost nonexistent, legal experts say. Child legal advocates say many states lack adequate resources to handle young inmates given long sentences, including a lack of proper jailhouse counseling. Few studies have been conducted on the psychological effects of young defendants facing life in prison at such a young age, said the Equal Justice Institute, which is representing Sullivan's high court case. ""We have created a forgotten population with a lot of needs,"" said Bryan Stevenson, Sullivan's lawyer. The crime happened in 1989, when, Sullivan admitted, he and two friends ransacked a home on Seabrook Street in West Pensacola. But he denied the prosecutor's claim that he returned with a knife and sexually assaulted the 72-year-old female homeowner. An older co-defendant claimed that Sullivan was the rapist. After a daylong trial, Escambia County Circuit Judge Nicholas Geeker sentenced Sullivan to life without parole. ""I am going to try to send him away for as long as I can. He is beyond help,"" the judge said. ""The juvenile system has been utterly incapable of doing anything with Mr. Sullivan."" Sullivan, who had a lengthy juvenile record, continues to deny that he committed the attack. At the time, state prosecutor Larry Kaden -- who retired this year -- said, ""It was a brutal crime, and he had an extensive record. This was a bad, bad crime."" The Florida attorney general's office told the high court that prosecutors should have the discretion they have long been given to decide how harshly young criminals should be prosecuted. Sexual battery remains a crime punishable by life imprisonment in Florida. A study by the nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative found eight prisoners serving life terms for crimes committed at age 13, all in the United States. Among them is another Florida inmate, Ian Manuel, who was 13 when convicted of attempted murder and robbery in 1990. The Justice Department reports that no 13-year-old has been given life without parole for a non-homicide in a decade. And although about a thousand people under 15 are arrested for rape every year, none has been given life without parole since Sullivan. Only a handful of states -- including Alaska, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and Oregon -- prohibit sentencing minors to life without a chance for parole, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The Equal Justice Initiative says 19 states have laws allowing the possibility of life without parole for those younger than 14. In 2005, the Supreme Court banned the death penalty for underage killers. The justices cited evolving ""national standards"" as a reason to ban such executions. Sullivan is in deteriorating health from multiple sclerosis and is confined to ""close management"" for dangerous or trouble-prone inmates, state corrections officials say. His lawyers admit that he has had more than a 100 incidents of fighting and threatening inmates and guards, plus having contraband and weapons, but they say Sullivan is the victim of bullying by other prisoners and is mentally disabled. ""It's important for the criminal justice system to recognize that inmates like Joe [Sullivan] are going to change biologically, psychologically and emotionally as they grow up in prison,"" Stevenson said. ""We should not assume it is a change for the worse."" The thrust of their argument before the high court is not that Sullivan is innocent or that he seeks his freedom now but that he deserves to someday make his case before the state parole board.","Justices will hear appeals of two Florida inmates sentenced as teens .

"The company that owns a cash depot targeted in a daring helicopter raid this week said Friday it is offering a reward of more than $1 million for information about the heist. A police Swat team enter a G4S cash depot in Vastberga, Stockholm. G4S said it is offering up to 7 million Swedish kronor ($1.01 million) for information leading directly to the arrest and conviction of the offenders or the recovery of the stolen money. G4S also said the circulation of cash in Stockholm would not be adversely affected by the heist, which occurred just days before Sweden's monthly payday, when the depot would have been rife with cash. The company did not disclose how much money had been lost, but the thieves could have gotten as much as the equivalent of several millions of U.S. dollars, according to CNN affiliate TV4. A group of heavily-armed thieves used a helicopter early Wednesday to land on the roof of the cash depot in Vastbarga, Stockholm, which serves automatic teller machines all across the capital, TV4 reported. They used explosives to get into the building, witness Bjorn Lockstrom told TV4, and later hoisted bags of money to the waiting chopper. TV4 later reported that the blueprints of the building were public documents which anybody could request to see. G4S had never asked for the blueprints to be classified. The helicopter had been stolen earlier during the night, police said. The thieves had also placed a bag marked ""bomb"" outside the police heliport, meaning Swedish police couldn't immediately pursue the thieves because they had to first deal with the bag. TV4 later reported that the bag never contained a bomb. The thieves had also blocked the roads around the cash depot with metal spikes, TV4 reported. No one was hurt during the heist, police said, even though several employees had been in the building when the robbers entered. Stockholm police said the heist had been elaborate. ""The robbery was very well planned. They brought a lot of firepower with them, among other things automatic weapons,"" Anders Bjargard from the Stockholm police, told TV4. Two people have been questioned in relation to the heist, but no one has been arrested. Police are still hopeful they will find the perpetrators. ""We have a lot of traces after the perpetrators, both where the robbery took place and where we found the helicopter,"" Bjargard said. The investigation is the biggest operation the Swedish police have mounted since the murder of Sweden's then-Foreign Minister Anna Lindh in 2003. ""It's an enormous piece of puzzle, and we don't want to miss anything,"" Anders Buren, head of police operations, told TV4. Since the heist, Swedish police have been criticized for storing their helicopters at an unguarded heliport in the Stockholm archipelago, which enabled the thieves easily to put the police helicopter out of commission. Swedish media also criticized police for not shooting at the thieves as they escaped in their helicopter. But Bengt Svensson, the head of Swedish police, defended the police officers' actions. ""Just because we now have criminals who act like they do in the movies doesn't mean that we can do it as well,"" Svensson told Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet.","Owners of Swedish cash depot offer £1M reward for information on heist .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- While a government-run public health care option irks conservatives, and even some fiscally minded Democrats, the idea of health care cooperatives has emerged as an option in the reform debate. Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad, of North Dakota, says a public option plan might not make it through Congress. Small health care cooperatives have worked in a couple of markets. But whether the idea can be applied on a national scale is debatable. Sen. Kent Conrad, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, is pushing the co-op idea as an alternative to a government-sponsored insurance program that would compete with private insurers. He doesn't think a government option will pass in the Senate. Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat, told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Tuesday that his model could attract 12 million members and ""be the third-largest insurer in the country and be a very effective competitor [with private insurance companies]."" ""If you believe competition helps drive down costs, then they would certainly contribute to holding down costs,"" Conrad said. But Tim Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University, said that Conrad is not offering concrete statistics on how the plan will help reform health care. ""I have not seen anything, other than Sen. Conrad's statements to the press, explaining how this is going to work,"" he said. ""He put out a couple of one-pagers early on, but he is talking about this actuarial data. Let's make it public, let's find out who the actuaries are."" Co-ops are nonprofit organizations that aim to provide better coverage at a lower cost for their members. They put profits back into the system, so any money that is earned is used on patients and other costs. In addition, patients elect a governing board. Cooperatives are already established in cities such as Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Seattle, Washington. In order for a co-op to have reduced costs, analysts say, it needs to have tens of thousands of members. That could be a hard slog for the nonprofits because start-up costs would probably be in the millions. That may be where the federal government steps in -- by adding seed money for the program. That government infusion of money probably would put Democrats at odds with Republicans, who are worried about the rising federal deficit and an expanded role of government in health care.  Watch two members of the House discuss reform » . And the costs of a cooperative might not allow enough people to sign up, meaning that some of the nearly 46 million uninsured Americans wouldn't be able to buy into the program. Other health reform alternatives, such as the public option, cost less for participants. ""Let's see how they [Conrad and others] explain that they are going to get to 10 to 12 million members. ... I can't see how that's going to happen,"" Jost said. Probably the biggest barrier, Jost said, is entering a new market and trying to establish a network. ""You have to go out there, you have to contract with hospitals, doctors, other providers of care. Well, the private insurers have their networks in place, and they often have what they call 'most favored nations' clauses, which provide that a provider cannot [offer] a lower rate than it does to the dominant insurer."" The idea of co-ops appears to have received some support from the Obama administration. A top White House aide told Bloomberg Television's ""Conversations with Judy Woodruff"" that President Obama may accept nonprofit health insurance cooperatives in place of a new government-run plan. ""We would be interested in that"" if certain conditions are met, said Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform. And the idea has gotten support from a key Republican senator. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that co-ops are ""a step in the right direction."" ""I don't know if it will do everything people want, but we ought to look at it. I think it's a far cry from the original proposals."" But not everyone is so sure that co-ops will work to reduce health care costs across the board. CNN Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, who spoke with top officials at both co-ops, said this type of model would not solve the problem of uninsured Americans. ""Will co-ops solve that? No. That is according to two folks who run co-ops [one in Seattle and one in Minneapolis]. ... They said 'we are not charities. You have to spend money and pay premiums to join our co-ops. And we don't take everyone. We sometimes say no to people with pre-existing conditions,' "" she said. Co-ops also may not have the industry clout of the big insurance companies.  Watch Obama discuss his plan for health care reform » . ""They [co-ops] would have some cost advantages over private plans -- they wouldn't have to make a profit -- but they are going to be running on a very small scale, at least initially, and therefore they are going to have very high administrative costs proportionate to claims,"" Jost said. ""But again, the big problem is how are they going to get providers to give them a better deal than the providers give the private insurers. They may not even be able to legally do that under their contracts with the commercial insurers,"" he added. CNN's Dana Bash, Lesa Jansen and Chris Welch contributed to this report.","Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad favors health care cooperatives .
Co-ops are run by nonprofits, and patients elect members to their boards .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A female marketing executive is suing the chief executive officer of a famous toy manufacturer, accusing him of sexually harassing and assaulting her. Steiff CEO Martin Frechen denies all the allegations. Both the company, known as the makers of the original Teddy bears, and another executive named in the lawsuit also deny the allegations in the lawsuit. The plaintiff, Jane Collins, now 32, joined Steiff as a temporary receptionist in 2000. She became Frechen's executive assistant in 2002, when he was named CEO of Steiff North America. Collins' lawsuit, filed Monday in New York state Supreme Court, contends that the harassment began in fall 2004, shortly before Frechen was to leave for Germany. After Collins rebuffed Frechen's advances in a hotel room and parking lot, he asked for her assistance in moving his wife's car to a storage unit, where he raped her, Collins alleges in her court filings. Collins' attorney, Chris Brennan, said his client was afraid that reporting the assault could jeopardize her job. She did not call police. ""I was a single mom at the time, and I simply couldn't afford to lose this job,"" Collins said in a statement issued by her attorney. The suit alleges that Frechen's unwanted advances continued after the assault, until as recently as February 2009. ""I had put it out of my mind, because I thought there was nothing I could do,"" she said. Brennan said, ""The company had in place no policies and procedures to inform her otherwise. ""This is a company that makes millions a dollars a year here in North America, and they didn't invest a dollar in training or educating their employees on sexual harassment policy."" Collins is seeking $80 million in damages. In addition to the allegations against Frechen, the suit alleges that the company, Margarete Steiff GmbH, Steiff North America Inc. and the company's head of U.S. operations, James Pitocco, are culpable for failing to take appropriate measures to stop Frechen's harassment after Collins reported his behavior. ""Steiff North America is committed to providing a safe and comfortable working environment for all of its employees. It does not comment on pending litigation. However, Steiff North America, Margarete Steiff and James Pitocco resolutely deny the allegations in Ms. Collins' complaint and will vigorously defend the claims made by her in court,"" David Rosenthal, an attorney for the company, said in a statement. ""They are confident that when all of the facts and circumstances relevant to this case are revealed during this litigation, Ms. Collins' claims will fail."" Michael Rosen, attorney for Frechen, issued a similar statement on behalf of his client. ""Mr. Frechen believes the plaintiff's claims are entirely without merit,"" he said. ""He intends to vigorously defend himself against these claims and believes he ultimately will prevail."" Founded by German seamstress Margarete Steiff, the Steiff toy company produced its first plush animal, a felt elephant pincushion, in 1880. In 1902, Theodore Roosevelt was president when Steiff launched the plush bear that would become the company's signature. Quickly dubbed ""Teddy's bear,"" 3,000 Steiff bears -- now collectors items -- were sold worldwide that year.

"DAVIS, California (CNN) -- If every scientist hopes to make at least one important discovery in her career, then University of California-Davis professor Pamela Ronald and her colleagues may have hit the jackpot. Scientists have bred a new strain of flood-tolerant rice that could help feed millions. Ronald's team works with rice, a grain most Americans take for granted, but which is a matter of life and death to much of the world. Thanks to their efforts to breed a new, hardier variety of rice, millions of people may not go hungry. About half the world's population eats rice as a staple. Two-thirds of the diet of subsistence farmers in India and Bangladesh is made up entirely of rice. If rice crops suffer, it can mean starvation for millions. ""People [in the United States] think, well, if I don't have enough rice, I'll go to the store,"" said Ronald, a professor of plant pathology at UC-Davis. ""That's not the situation in these villages. They're mostly subsistence farmers. They don't have cars."" As sea levels rise and world weather patterns worsen, flooding has become a major cause of rice crop loss. Scientists estimate 4 million tons of rice are lost every year because of flooding. That's enough rice to feed 30 million people. Rice is grown in flooded fields, usually to kill weeds. But rice plants do not like it when they are submerged in water for long periods, Ronald said. ""They don't get enough carbon dioxide, they don't get enough light and their entire metabolic processes are thrown off. The rice plant tries to grow out of the flood, but when it does, it depletes its sugar reserves. It starts to break down its chlorophyll, important for photosynthesis. It grows really quickly, and then when the flood recedes, it just dies. It's out of gas."" Normal rice dies after three days of complete flooding. Researchers know of at least one rice variety that can tolerate flooding for longer periods, but conventional breeding failed to create a strain that was acceptable to farmers. So Ronald and her colleagues -- David Mackill, senior scientist at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines and Julia Bailey-Serres, professor of genetics at the University of California-Riverside -- spent the last decade working to find a rice strain that could survive flooding for longer periods. Mackill identified a flood-resistant gene 13 years ago in a low-yielding traditional Indian rice variety. He passed along the information to Ronald, who isolated the gene, called Sub1, and introduced it into normal rice varieties, generating rice that could withstand being submerged in water for 17 days. The team relied on something called precision breeding, the ability to introduce very specific genes into plants without the associated baggage of other genes that might tag along in conventional breeding. ""This can be a problem for farmers,"" Ronald said. ""The varieties that were developed from conventional breeding were rejected by farmers because they didn't yield well or taste good."" Using precision breeding, scientists introduced the Sub1 gene three years ago into test fields in Bangladesh and India. The subsequent rice harvests were a resounding success. ""The results were really terrific,"" said Ronald. ""The farmers found three- to five-fold increases in yield due to flood tolerance. They can plant the normal way. They can harvest the normal way and it tastes the same. Farmers had more food for their families and they also had additional rice they could sell to bring a little bit of money into the household."" ""The potential for impact is huge,"" agreed Mackill in a statement on the IRRI Web site. ""In Bangladesh, for example, 20 percent of the rice land is flood prone and the country typically suffers several major floods each year. Submergence-tolerant varieties could make major inroads into Bangladesh's annual rice shortfall."" The researchers anticipate that the flood-tolerant rice plants will be available to farmers in Bangladesh and India within two years. Because the plants are the product of precision breeding, rather than genetic modification, they are not subject to the same regulatory testing that can delay release of genetically modified crops. The U.S. Department of Agriculture conferred one of its highest research awards last December on Ronald, Mackill and Bailey-Serres for their work on submergence-tolerant rice. But Ronald has no plans to rest on her laurels. ""I feel a great sense of gratitude that I was able to contribute in this way,"" she said. ""But the farmers have asked us, 'Can you develop varieties that are drought tolerant, salt tolerant? Can you develop varieties that are insect resistant?' There are always more things to work on.""

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- While many now recognize the scientific explanation for a solar eclipse, the phenomenon is still marked with tradition and sometimes suspicion in Hindu-majority India. People test the ""sky watching telescope"" at the Gujarat Council of Science City in India. The ""exceptionally long"" eclipse that will cross half the planet Wednesday will be able to be seen by virtually all of the population of China and India. For beggars in India, the occasion means an extra day of receiving alms and food. The panhandler in Sandeep Jaggi's neighborhood normally visits the block every week on Tuesdays and Saturdays, as well as the days of a new and full moon. And because his patrons mark an eclipse with alms-giving, prayers and bathing, he rarely misses the chance to meet them on this day as well. ""It's a family tradition and I follow it,"" says 34-year-old Jaggi. He will fill the beggar's small steel pail with mustard oil and coins and his disheveled sash with lentils. For others in the country, the eclipse is not a reason to celebrate, but a more ominous phenomenon. Send us your photos of the eclipse . Most pregnant women hope to avoid giving birth during an eclipse. ""None of the expectant mothers under my treatment are willing to have deliveries on Wednesday,"" Shivani Sachdev Gour, a gynecologist at New Delhi's Fortis La Femme hospital, told CNN. In fact, there are critically ill patients who do not want to be in the hospital on the day of the eclipse, she said. Indian astrologers even advise expectant mothers to stay indoors when this celestial event occurs. ""It may not cause any physical harm to the baby, but it may affect the child's overall personality,"" said R.K. Sharma, who describes himself as a ""remedial astrologer."" A solar eclipse, he says, weakens the sun god temporarily because of an encounter with dragon Rahu and leaves some cascading results everywhere. ""Bathing in holy rivers and ponds during this time thus helps protect health and develop positivism and greater will power,"" he explained. About 1.5 million people are expected at one such pond -- the Brahmsarovar, or the pool of Hindu god Brahma -- in northern India on Wednesday. ""They offer prayers to the sun god and take holy dips during an eclipse,"" said Ashok Kumar Bansal, the sub-divisional magistrate of Kurukshetra, an ancient Hindu city. But the century's longest total solar eclipse is not just about the dragon-sun combat, it also means business for some. Travel firms in India have plans in place to cash in on the phenomenon. Cox and Kings India has a planeload of eclipse watchers heading for the eastern state of Bihar, one of the most preferred locations for sighting the event. The plane will hover over Gaya in Bihar and return to New Delhi the same day, company spokesman Thomas C. Thottathil told CNN. Passengers were given two options: to book a ""sunside"" seat facing the eclipse for about $1,640, or reserve an ""earthside"" seat for about $610, Thottathil added.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage has pretty much got this acting thing down. After all, he started acting at the age of 15 and, well, he's got that Oscar. Nicolas Cage says that Academy Awards are ""not as important as children and making them happy."" So he doesn't really need to deliver another gut-wrenching performance to demonstrate his chops. In fact, he can deviate from a traditional film and venture into animated territory. He's voiced animated characters in the past, but in Disney's new 3-D tale ""G-Force,"" Cage lends his voice to a mole. Speckles the star-nosed mole comes to life thanks to the film's impressive digital animation and Cage's voice. At first it's unclear that Cage is the voice behind Speckles, because he changes his sound for the critter, er, character. CNN talked to Cage about playing a mole, animated films and his taking walks in the forest. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: What do you play in this film? Nicolas Cage: I'm playing Speckles, the mole, and he's an outsider. He's an iconoclast -- he doesn't fit in. He doesn't get into the fray with the ""G-Force,"" the other guinea pigs. But his IQ is off the charts, and he's a technological wizard. CNN: So, you're an Academy Award-winning actor, and you decided to play (this role). How did this come about? Cage: To me, nothing's more sacred than the magical world of children, and with everything that's going on in the world, it gets increasingly more challenging to keep our kids smiling -- people are losing their jobs, families are tense. So anything I can do to give families something to look forward to and to put a smile back on children's faces -- I'm gonna do. Disney has a great tradition of enchanting children and giving them something to behold. I mean, you mention Academy Awards -- I mean, that's not as important as children and making them happy. CNN: Tell me about your voice: Why did you decide to really change it when you read the script? Cage: Mel Blanc is a hero because of what he could do with his voice for all the Looney Tunes, the Warner Brothers cartoons, to be the voice of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Porky Pig. To me, he's a great actor. I mean, one of the great character actors, and I knew that if I was gonna be in this movie, I'd want to do something like that and transform my voice. CNN: So you're clearly comfortable playing a mole? Cage: I'm comfortable with the mole, yeah. I mean, yeah, he's different, he's got issues, you know? I don't want a perfect character, I want a character who has, as strange as it sounds, some humanity, some flaws, some needs. But to be fair, I'm not in a lot of this movie. This is Darwin's movie, um Sam Rockwell and Penelope Cruz's movie -- they're the stars. I'm only in it at the beginning and the end. CNN : You seem to be a big fan of animated films. Cage: I do enjoy animated movies. I really love anime and movies like ""Spirited Away"" and ""Howl's Moving Castle."" I like movies where you feel like you're going into another world, and no matter how many times you watch it, you're gonna see something new in that world. That level of detail really inspires me. CNN: Is there less pressure doing an animated film and lending your voice to a character as opposed to a traditional film? Cage: Well, you don't have the pressure of the camera. And that's -- that's very liberating. And you don't have the pressure of other actors trying to remember their dialogue or not being in rhythm with you. The challenge though is, these movies take years to make, and I may not be in the same state of mind I was in a year ago or two years ago, and then they tend to pull you out of wherever you are and put you back in a box, and then try to get the voice out of you again, so that's the rub. CNN: Have you gotten pretty good at honing your skills when it comes to choosing roles, or is it always a risk? Cage: I mean it is always a gamble. You never know what's gonna happen with a movie. But I think it's more of a matter of, am I doing something that I believe in on any level? Like, am I going to entertain children, or am I going to make a movie that I can stand by because it means well on some level? That's becoming more and more a part of the criteria. CNN: How do you think you've changed as an actor throughout your career? Cage: I think I've become more relaxed. I don't feel the need to jump up and down and make a big noise to get people to pay attention to me. I don't need to um, you know, do punk rock gestures or eat a cockroach or do something weird to say I exist. I feel like I'm hearing a different kind of sound now. It's a much more subtle sound, but it's still a truthful sound, that I can express myself in, in roles that are much more relaxed and seasoned as opposed to boisterous and rock and roll. CNN: What's inspiring to you, in every day. Cage: Well, I find children inspiring. The way they look at the world. The magical world they live in, to me, is inspiring. I like -- I mean, I'm afraid I'm gonna answer your questions and sound like a complete nature addict here, but uh, I like nature, I enjoy going for walks, I like the ocean, I like the forest. CNN: Is that what you do when you're not working, that's important to you in your life? Cage: Yes. Yes, I like to go for walks in the forest.","Nicolas Cage voices character of Speckles the mole in ""G-Force""

"(Mental Floss) -- Sure, you know these five creatures as stinging, biting merchants of death. But isn't it time we put aside our differences and embraced the positive? A creepy crawler from this guy's family could save your brain from cancer some day. 1. Poison dart frogs: The heart-healthy choice . It could kill you: You know an animal is bad news when its sweat was once considered a state-of-the-art military technology. Meet the poison dart frog, which secretes a highly dangerous neurotoxin, called batrachotoxin, through its pores. In fact, various Latin American tribes used to collect the stuff (carefully) to poison the tips of their arrows for hunting and warfare. Interestingly, however, the frogs don't produce their own toxin. They get it from eating insects that most likely pick up the poison from the plants they consume. The same frogs, if raised in a laboratory rather than the rain forest, aren't poisonous at all. But it just might cure you: Before batrachotoxin stops your heart, it speeds it up. Consequently, medical experts believe it might be possible to tweak elements of the frog's toxin to bring patients out of cardiac arrest and potentially save lives. And because it also deadens nerve endings, batrachotoxin has potential as an ingredient in anesthetics.  Watch how gator blood may be become super drug » . Studies into other uses of the toxin are still in the early stages, but the frog's medical benefits bolster the argument for preserving the rainforest. Most scientists believe we've only just begun to grasp the pharmaceutical possibilities of some of the world's rarest and deadliest creatures. 2. Scorpions: Leading the battle against brain cancer . It could kill you: For the most part, scorpions use their toxins to capture prey, ward off competitors during mating season, and defend themselves against larger predators. Unfortunately, humans count as larger predators. A sting by some species can leave you with any number of potentially deadly conditions, including heart and lung failure. But it just might cure you: Medical researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) have discovered a new use for scorpion venom -- cancer medication. Each year, some 9,000 Americans are diagnosed with malignant glioma, a form of brain cancer that kills about half its victims within a year of diagnosis. Glioma cells work a lot like cockroach muscle cells. And while that fact is pretty disgusting, it also got UAB researchers thinking about the giant Israeli scorpion, whose venom is harmless to humans but deadly to its cockroach prey. Doctors found that when they injected a drug derived from the venom of giant Israeli scorpions into cancer-infected human brains, the poison destroyed the glioma cells and left surrounding, healthy cells alone. The treatment is still in the early stages of development, but researchers remain optimistic. 3. Cone shell snails: Little creatures tackling big pain . It could kill you: Thanks to their unique colors and intricate patterns, cone shells look like they'd make great beach souvenirs. But watch your fingers; they're actually home to one of the world's deadliest creatures. Cone shell snails come equipped with an extendable ""arm"" -- complete with a sharp, venomous tooth -- that they use to immobilize and kill prey. And while the venom certainly helps the slow-moving hunters from going hungry, it can also paralyze, or even kill, victims. The good news: Death by cone shell is completely painless. But it just might cure you: Cone shell venom, called conotoxin, has incredible potential as a painkiller, with one added bonus: Unlike many current anesthetics, conotoxin isn't addictive. In 2005, Ireland-based Elan Pharmaceuticals became the first company to market a drug made from the venom. Called Prialt, the drug is pumped into the fluid around a patient's spine to relieve chronic pain and is believed to be up to 1,000 times more powerful than morphine. Meanwhile, at the University of Melbourne, a research team headed by Professor Bruce Livett is currently developing another conotoxin-based painkiller called ACV1, which was first tested on humans in the summer of 2005. Unlike Prialt, however, ACV1 doesn't affect a patient's blood pressure and can be injected under the skin, making it a lot less intimidating. Plus, ACV1 is believed to be as much as 10,000 times stronger than morphine. 4. Vipers: Lowering your blood pressure since 1981 . It could kill you: Most vipers are scary enough as is, but jararaca vipers are venomous to boot. But what's truly fascinating is the unique way their venom works. Unlike a traditional toxin, viper venom functions by preventing the blood from clotting, meaning the snakes actually kill their victims by causing them to bleed to death. But it just might cure you: Lucky for us, slow-clotting blood isn't always a bad thing. Researchers have found that small doses of viper venom can prevent arteries from hardening, thus stopping the kinds of blood clots that commonly occur in cardiac patients. In fact, jararaca viper venom (or at least a synthesized version of it) is a key ingredient in most of today's ACE inhibitors. Introduced in 1981, ACE inhibitors work by slowing down the body's angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). When left untreated, the enzyme can produce a peptide that causes muscle constriction around blood vessels. That kind of constriction can set off a chain reaction whereby a person's blood vessels narrow and his or her blood pressure shoots through the roof, leading to greater risk of heart attack and other ailments. Because the ACE inhibitors can stop this domino effect, they're frequently used to treat millions of men and women with high blood pressure. 5. Gila monsters: Attacking type 2 diabetes . It could kill you: One of only two species of venomous lizards, the Gila monster is native to southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Unlike other deadly critters, Gila monsters don't inject venom directly into their victims. Instead, poison oozes from the lizard's teeth into the open wounds of its prey, usually while the Gila monster is chewing. Because of this, human fatalities from Gila monster bites are rare, but a bite can cause intense pain, nausea, swelling, fatigue, dizziness, and chills -- none of which is particularly fun. But it just might cure you: In addition to causing all those nasty side effects, Gila monster venom stimulates insulin production and slows down glucose production, which is great news for diabetics. Byetta, a drug manufactured by Amylin Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly & Company to treat Type 2 diabetes, uses a manufactured form of Gila monster venom as its main ingredient. Approved by the FDA in April of 2005, Byetta is injected before meals to help their bodies produce the right amount of insulin at the right time -- the best part being that it doesn't cause the mood swings often associated with traditional insulin regimens.

"VANCOUVER, British Columbia (CNN) -- When Canadian cocaine smuggler Charles Lai was being sentenced in a Seattle federal courtroom last month, the judge sending him to prison for 13 years offered a small item of good news. A suspected gang member in Vancouver is taken out of a bar in handcuffs. At least behind bars, Judge James Robart said, drug smuggler Lai would not become another fatality in Vancouver's gang wars. Authorities in Vancouver, just 30 miles from the border, are struggling to deal with the boom in the drug trade between the United States and Canada, along with the violence that has come with it. Cocaine from Mexico -- and many of the guns that fuel the violence -- come north via the United States. Canadian smugglers then bring south high-quality marijuana known as ""BC Bud"" and synthetic drugs like methamphetamine. A recent U.N. drug report named Canada as the ""primary"" supplier of Ecstasy to the United States. The gang killings are blamed in part over who will control which areas of this estimated $6 billion-a-year narcotics trade. Beyond the string of slayings and shootings that have taken place over the last two years are the new modes in which the violence is carried out. ""It's the type of murders, the more brazen public shootings, the shootings in front of the grocery store with automatic weapons,"" said superintendent Pat Fogarty of the Royal Mounted Police, who oversees a special multi-jurisdictional unit that is taking on the gangs and larger criminal organizations behind them. ""It's common now for gangsters to carry body armor and wear it, to have bulletproof cars,"" Fogarty said. ""What that does is when one gang is shooting up another gang, their .40-calibers aren't able to pierce the body armor of the vehicle or the body armor of the vests. So what we've seen is an elevation in firepower, which is a scary process.""  Watch how authorities are fighting the gangs » . Some of the incidents have already become legend: the car radio repairman killed while fixing a gangster's stereo, thugs shooting up the parking garage of a mall with machine guns, the postal worker refusing to deliver mail to a street where a family with well-known gang ties live. The gangs -- police estimate there at least 120 different groups operating in Vancouver and the surrounding area -- have names like the UN, the Red Scorpions, the Big Circle Boys and the Independent Soldiers. They are mostly homegrown operations or recruits from immigrant communities. Some gang members come from middle-class families and join up expecting the Hollywood version of criminal life. ""These guys act like rock stars,"" said Sgt. Kieron McConnell of the British Columbia Integrated Gang Task Force. It's McConnell's job to remove what he calls ""the mystique of being a gangster."" A 20-year police veteran with a looming frame and completely bald head, McConnell and the officers who patrol with him act as a buzzkill to many gang members' night on the town. The Gang Task Force slowly winds through bars and clubs known for their gangster clientele. Until closing time, the police check for identification and run names. Through an agreement with most of the bars in the city, when police find anyone with a history of violence or drug peddling, they can bounce them from the establishment -- no questions asked. The police's goal is not to harass the gang members, they say, but to remove a potential target from an area full of bystanders. ""We are encouraging them not to bring violence with them to where they socialize,"" McConnell said. Chris Mohan's son did not need to go far, however, to become an innocent victim of the gangs. The violence literally came to his doorstep. In October 2007, Mohan, 22 years old, was walking out of the apartment where he lived with his parents when gang hit men came to murder a neighbor police believe was involved in the drug trade. Mohan was one of six people killed in the shooting. ""They killed Chris, but I got a life sentence,"" Mohan's mother, Eileen Mohan, said of having to live without her son. Despite what they took from her, Eileen Mohan does not show any fear of the gangs. She has become an advocate for tougher sentencing of violent criminals, attends the hearings for the men accused of her son's killing and still lives in the apartment where he died. Her mission now is to hurt gangsters. ""They touched my life illegally, I want to touch theirs legally,"" she said. Even though police say they are taking the fight to the gangs like never before, it remains to be seen if authorities can totally dismantle Vancouver's gangs and the larger criminal organization behind them.  Watch how border agents look for smuggled drugs » . Police say they need legislation passed that would enable them to monitor encrypted cell phone conversations and for the legal system to pass down stiffer sentences on gangsters. Tougher sentences may explain why more Canadian drug traffickers like Charles Lai face a courtroom in America, not Canada. Even though Canadian authorities say they are capable of trying their own criminals, crime experts say police are sometimes all too happy if smugglers are captured in the United States, where they face a less bureaucratic justice system and longer stretches in jail. ""In these regional operations, the tendency has been for the offenders to be arrested, charged and processed in the United States, not Canada,"" said Robert Gordon, director of the School of Criminology at the Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. ""That's an indictment of how we are handling this.""","Thirty miles from U.S. border, authorities in Vancouver confronting gang warfare .

"(CNN) -- An Arizona man caught leaving water bottles in the desert for illegal immigrants has been sentenced to 300 hours of community service and a year of probation, an aid group said. Walt Staton was convicted in June of littering by leaving jugs of water in a wildlife refuge. Walt Staton, a member of the group No More Deaths, left full water bottles in December in Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge for the illegal immigrants who routinely pass through the 18,000-acre refuge, according to court documents. A judge sentenced him Tuesday to 300 hours of picking up trash on public property and a year of probation, No More Deaths said in a written statement. He is also banned from the refuge during that time, the group said. Although the case involved only a misdemeanor charge, both sides used the divisive issue of illegal immigration in their arguments; Staton's lawyer argued that Staton's actions were humanitarian, but the government said otherwise. In a sentencing memo, the federal prosecutors wrote that Staton's ""actions are not about humanitarian efforts, but about protesting the immigration policies of the United States, and aiding those that enter illegally into the United States."" Noting the phrase scrawled on many of the plastic water jugs -- ""buena suerte,"" or ""good luck"" in Spanish -- the prosecutors said, ""The obvious conclusion is that the defendant and No More Deaths wish to aid illegal aliens in their entry attempt."" They also said, as did the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, that leaving the full plastic jugs on the refuge is detrimental to the health of the animals that live there. Citing a biologist, the prosecutors said that animals could eat the plastic and that others could get feet or antlers caught on the bottles. Prosecutors had requested a $5,000 fine, along with five years of probation, according to court documents. Staton, who No More Deaths says is to begin seminary school at the Claremont School of Theology in Claremont, California, had initially refused to pay a $175 fine for littering, said Staton's lawyer, Bill Walker. After his refusal, the government enhanced the charges against him, arguing that he ""knowingly littered,"" said Walker, who is also a member of No More Deaths. The charge can carry a $100,000 fine and a year in jail, Walker said. Charges against three other people who were cited with Staton in December were dropped, he said. A jury convicted Staton in June of littering. Walker said he is appealing. ""We think that Walt did nothing wrong,"" he said. ""We do not think that this conviction will be upheld on appeal."" He described Staton as ""the kind of guy you'd want to have as your next door neighbor."" A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Arizona declined comment. Mike Hawkes of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge said Thursday that although he had no issue with groups leaving water out for illegal immigrants, ""there's ways to do it without leaving plastic jugs out there."" He said the plastic jugs were strewn throughout the refuge, which is home to hundreds of bird, reptile and mammal species, according to its Web site. ""We have sympathy for what they have to do,"" he said. But ""they have do to do it without putting plastic bottles out there. ... You can't go anywhere in the refuge without seeing plastic bottles through the countryside."" Hawkes said refuge officials and members of No More Deaths had met and were trying to come up with methods that don't involve plastic bottles. Staton is the second member of No More Deaths to be convicted of littering, according to court documents; however, the other received a suspended sentence. Walker said that after Staton's conviction, 13 No More Deaths members were charged with littering on the refuge. With tens of thousands of illegal immigrants crossing through the refuge -- Hawkes said last year's number was about 54,000, down from hundreds of thousands years earlier -- the last water-related death there was in June 2008, he said.","No More Deaths member gets 300 hours of community service, year of probation .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki voiced cautious optimism regarding the situation in Iraq Wednesday, noting greater stability and decreased violence as U.S. troops continue to cede control to their Iraqi counterparts. President Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki talk Wednesday at the White House. ""I have no doubt that there will be some tough days ahead,"" Obama said during a joint appearance of the leaders at the White House. ""There are still those who want to foment sectarian conflict. ... But make no mistake, those efforts will fail,"" he added. The president said he is committed to moving forward with a pledge to remove all American combat brigades from Iraq by the end of August 2010, as well as all U.S. troops by the end of 2011. Al-Maliki promised the Iraqi government would step up its efforts to prevent a return of widespread sectarian violence. ""Those who thought that the Iraqi forces [would] be incapable of imposing peace and security [have been] proved to be wrong,"" he said.  Watch al-Maliki speak about ""strategic friendship"" with U.S. » . In addition to meeting with Obama, al-Maliki is scheduled to sit down with Vice President Joe Biden. He will also meet with the secretaries of State, Defense and Treasury, and with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Some foreign policy experts have expressed concern that as the United States pivots from Iraq to Afghanistan, Iraq and its problems will be ignored. Responding to that criticism, one senior administration official said this week, ""Our goal is, in fact as we formalize the relationship, to concentrate on other areas,"" but he suggested that Iraq would remain a U.S. priority. Hours before the two leaders met, at least five Iranian pilgrims were killed and dozens more wounded earlier Wednesday in an attack northeast of Baghdad. The violence came a day after a spate of bombings left at least 22 Iraqis dead and about 150 wounded.

"(CNN) -- In a field largely still in its infancy, scientists are making headway toward using stem cells to treat heart ailments. The FDA regulates which adult stem cell techniques are allowed to go into clinical trials. The major focus of stem cell research in cardiology is promoting regeneration of the heart or preventing scar formation, said Jeffrey Karp, who runs a stem cell biology lab at Harvard University. One study reporting successful results in humans involves harvesting patients' own stem cells, purifying them, and injecting them directly into the heart muscle. The stem cells have a surface marker called CD34, which means they are capable of growing new blood vessels. The study, sponsored by Baxter Inc., is the largest adult stem cell study for  heart disease in the U.S., said Dr. Douglas Losordo, cardiologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, who is leading the trial. The researchers will present their one-year findings from Phase II of the trial in September, Losordo said. ""It's important to point out that this is a use of a patient's own body's repair capabilities,"" Losordo said. If everything goes well, it's conceivable this treatment could be widely available in a little over four years, he said. The target patient population, consisting of end-stage cardiac patients who have tried all other available therapies, is about 300,000 to 900,000 people, he said. So far, researchers have not found side effects from this method, Losordo said. However, because it is an invasive surgical procedure in which stem cells are delivered through a catheter, there is a risk of perforation of about 1 percent, he said. There is also a small risk of blood clotting from the drug, GCSF, which mobilizes stem cells. Injecting stem cells into the heart muscle carries the risk of arrhythmia, said Techung Lee, associate professor of biochemistry at the State University New York at Buffalo. But Losordo said this risk is theoretical in his trial, and is believed to be very low with CD34 cells in general. Lee and colleagues are working on a less-invasive technique. In a study in mice, they injected stem cells from bone marrow into skeletal muscles of limbs. They found that the stem cells produced growth factors that traveled to the heart, in addition to stimulating the muscle itself to make growth factors that also improved cardiac function. The challenge for translating this method to humans would be that, while each mouse needed only a few million stem cells, each human patient would need close to a billion stem cells for the therapy -- which would be far too expensive and logistically difficult. ""This is a problem that's been experienced by everyone in the field,"" Lee said. He estimates that his method could be available clinically in five years, after researchers find ways to reduce the required number of cells by a factor of 10 or even 100. Another therapeutic possibility is giving a patient an IV of stem cells, which would come from a stem cell bank or a company. The challenge is that the cells may not have the right homing receptors to land in the heart, Karp said. Karp's group is working on an approach to chemically modify the surface of cells to enhance their targeting to specific sites. Results from animal models have shown promising results for targeting sites of inflammation, he said. ""Essentially we know the ZIP code of vessels within a certain tissue, we can program the address on the surface of the cell,"" he said. Lee's and Karp's teams use adult mesenchymal stem cells, which may develop into connective tissue, lymphatic tissue, and blood vessels. These stem cells are largely interchangeable between patients and don't require matching, as organ transplants do. However, as more becomes known about the relatively new field of stem cell therapy, a more specific matching system may be required, said Dr. Joon Lee, cardiologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Some stem cell therapies for the heart are being tested in human clinical trials. Osiris Therapeutics Inc. is enrolling patients in a phase II trial for Prochymal, which contains mesenchymal stem cells. The company intends to use this drug, which gets injected into the vein, to repair heart damage in patients who have just experienced their first heart attack. More than 90 percent of research on using stem cells to repair the human heart involves adult stem cells, Lee said. That means the controversy about using stem cells derived from human embryos is largely absent from this line of research. For developing treatments that involve transplanting stem cells from adults, there is no ethical concern about the use of embryos, Lee said. Embryonic stem cells are advantageous in research because they can be grown more easily than adult stem cells in a culture, and are pluripotent, meaning they can develop into any of the various cell types of the body, according to the National Institutes of Health. But it is not yet known whether tissues derived from embryonic stem cells would cause transplant rejection, whereas this does not seem to be a problem with adult stem cells. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates which adult stem cell techniques are allowed to go into clinical trials and sets the requirements for more routine use. Whether the FDA will become more or less lenient in these respects is unclear, Lee said. It's not unfathomable that within the next two to five years, some FDA-approved stem cell treatments will be available for cardiovascular disease, Lee said. Karp has a longer view -- five to 10 years before stem cell treatments become widely available for heart problems, he said. The biology of stem cell treatments for the heart is not well understood, said Dr. Ronald Crystal, chief of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. One of the challenges is that once a stem cell gets put into a person's body, no one can get it out, Crystal said. This is the opposite of other kinds of medications -- for instance, a person may get sick from taking too many aspirin, but eventually the drug leaves the system. Not so with stem cells, he said. Crystal expressed general caution about the future of stem cell research, which is still experimental, for heart patients. ""This is a good idea, but patients and families should not expect immediate results,"" he said.","Most stem cell research targeted at the heart uses adult stem cells .
The FDA regulates adult stem cell techniques that are allowed to go into clinical trials .
Unlike organ transplants, adult stem cells generally can be given to any patient .

"(CNN) -- Three Disney monorail workers have been placed on paid leave just days after two monorail trains crashed at the Orlando, Florida, theme park, killing one of the train's operators, according to a Disney spokeswoman. Train operator Austin Wuennenberg, 21, was killed in Sunday's monorail crash. Walt Disney World spokeswoman Zoraya Suarez said the action was ""part of an investigative process, not a disciplinary action."" The three workers were a monorail maintenance shop member, the monorail pilot of one of the trains and a transportation manager. Disney would not name the employees. The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the Sunday morning accident, is expected to be at the park for several days. ""To this point in the investigation, no anomalies or malfunctions have been found with the automatic train stop system or with any mechanical components of the switch or with either trains,"" the NTSB said in a statement. The crash killed operator Austin Wuennenberg, 21. The operator of the other train was taken to a hospital, where he was treated and released. Additionally, six passengers on Wuennenberg's train were treated at the scene for minor injuries. Wuennenberg was piloting the ""Purple"" train. The other train, known as the ""Pink"" train, was operated by one of the employees who has since been placed on leave. The Pink train was instructed to go back through a track switch that would take it from the monorail's Epcot loop to the Magic Kingdom loop. ""For undetermined reasons that are currently under investigation, the switch had not changed position needed to allow the Pink train to be routed to the Magic Kingdom loop,"" putting the Pink and Purple trains on a collision course, the NTSB statement said. NTSB investigators believe that Wuennenberg attempted to put his train into reverse before the collision, attempting to avoid the crash.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- London police have arrested a man in connection with a brazen daylight robbery of a jewelry store last week, they announced Wednesday. Security camera footage shows images of the men wanted by police. The 50-year-old man was arrested on Monday, police revealed. Some $65 million in merchandise was stolen in the August 6 robbery. On Tuesday police released surveillance camera photos of two men sought for questioning over the heist as well as  images of some of the rings, bracelets, necklaces and watches taken from Graff Jewellers on central London's New Bond Street. A total of 43 items were taken, with a value of about £40 million, or about $65 million, Scotland Yard said. The heist occurred August 6, when two men walked into the jewelry store at about 4:40 p.m. and threatened employees with handguns. As the robbers were leaving the store, they brought a female worker outside with them before leaving in a blue BMW, Scotland Yard said. A shot was fired outside the store, but no one was injured. The men abandoned the BMW nearby, firing a second shot into the ground, Scotland Yard said. Police believe they switched to a silver Mercedes, then later to a black vehicle, possibly a Ford or Volkswagen. ""This was a well-planned robbery with a number of vehicles used to help the robbers escape,"" Detective Chief Inspector Pam Mace said in the statement. ""These men are extremely dangerous and fired at least two shots in busy London streets as they made their getaway.  Watch how robbers rip off London jewelers » . ""Someone knows who these men are,"" she said. ""They would undoubtedly have spoken about (the robbery) before or boasted about it afterwards. I would urge anyone who recognizes them, knows the whereabouts of the jewelry or has any other information to contact us."" The images show the two men dressed in suits and ties. One man is white, about 30, police said. The second is a black man believed to be in his 30s with short hair. Both men are thought to have spoken with London accents, Scotland Yard said. The robbery is the latest in a spate of daytime thefts at jewelry stores and designer shops in London's exclusive shopping areas of Bond Street, which includes New Bond Street. Groups of men or teenagers typically stage ""smash and grab"" robberies, in which they break the windows and steal anything they can get their hands on before speeding away in waiting cars or motorbikes. A CNN camera crew filming in March on Oxford Street, near Bond Street, caught a group of thieves speeding away on motorbikes from a jewelry store they had just robbed. The thieves choose to strike during the day when a store's security system is typically disarmed, even though the store and sidewalk may be crowded with people.","London police arrest man in connection with brazen daylight robbery of jewelry store .

"(CNN) -- From baby deliveries to unexpected deaths, Mike Bowes, a 911 dispatcher from Quincy, Massachusetts, has handled a wide range of emergency calls. Emergency dispatcher Mike Bowes received a call that his home was in flames Monday night. But Monday night, the 44-year-old received an unexpected call from his neighbor: His own house was on fire. The 911 call came in about 10:45 p.m. Monday, a little more than an hour before Mike Bowes' shift ended. My neighbor's house just blew up, the caller said. ""What's the address?"" Mike Bowes asked patiently, just as he did with every emergency call for the past 11 years with the Quincy Police Department. The caller frantically relayed the address, Bowes' home address for 20 years. ""It was shocking,"" Mike Bowes said. ""I thought she was kidding. It's a long shot. I mean, what's the chances it will be your house?"" Out of 90,000 people who reside in Quincy, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, Mike Bowes' was the home in flames, and he had answered the emergency call. Thoughts raced through his mind: Are my parents OK? Are the neighbors safe? What about my stuff? Following procedure, Mike Bowes transferred the call to the fire department. Soon, dozens of calls about the fire from other neighbors began to pour into the control room.  Watch Mike Bowes talk about the fire » . One of the callers was his mother, Elizabeth Bowes, 68. She and her husband, Donald Bowes, 72, had escaped unharmed. About 10:45 p.m., Elizabeth Bowes was reading a novel in the kitchen when she heard the explosion and saw flames shoot through the kitchen window. She ran to wake her husband in a first-floor bedroom. There was also a landlord living in upstairs. Firefighters arrived within minutes and helped her to safety. Within five minutes of receiving the call, police escorted Mike Bowes to his home. He could see the fire light up the dark sky from afar. Anxious neighbors gathered in the park nearby. He was relieved to find his parents together on the sidewalk. ""My parents are alive; my neighbors are alive,"" he said. ""It's an inconvenience, but we'll get through it."" In another coincidence, one of the first firefighters to arrive on scene was Mike Bowes' cousin, Tom Bowes. Tom Bowes, a firefighter for the past eight years, scrambled into the house to salvage old albums with wedding and baby photos amid the flames. But everything else -- the clothes, electronics and furniture -- were destroyed. No one was injured in the fire, and firefighters have yet to determine what caused the blaze. They say it started in the garage, about 15 feet from the home. Mike Bowes says his job prepared him to deal with the challenging circumstances. Bowes and his family are living in a hotel, and local police officers and firefighters have donated clothes and money. ""A lot of people think dispatchers are strange because I've been joking about what happened,"" he said. ""I say, 'If I'm not laughing, I'll start crying.' This is what I have to do.""","Massachusetts dispatcher answered neighbor's call about burning home .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece the ""Mona Lisa"" was attacked with a mug earlier this month, but the world's most famous painting -- protected by thick glass -- emerged with its enigmatic smile undimmed. The ""Mona Lisa"" sits behind bulletproof glass in the Louvre gallery. French police say a woman ""not in her senses"" lobbed the mug at the 500-year-old painting, which hangs in the Louvre gallery in Paris. The woman, a tourist, was later transferred from police custody to a psychiatric unit, a police spokesman told CNN. The spokesman declined to be identified, and did not say where the woman was from. The ""Mona Lisa,"" considered one of the world's most valuable paintings, sits behind bulletproof glass in a special wing of the Louvre, attracting visitors in their millions. The Italian Renaissance masterpiece, which depicts a dark-haired young woman with an aloof facial expression, has been the target of attacks in the past. In 1956 the artwork was damaged when acid was thrown at it. A rock was also thrown in a separate incident in the same year. In 1911 it was stolen from the Louvre but was returned two years later.

"(CNN) --   Known for building skate parks and shaping the skateboarding scene in New York, Andy Kessler, 48, died this week after an allergic reaction to an insect sting, friends and family told news media. Andy Kessler, seen in 2005, reportedly died this week after suffering an allergic reaction to an insect sting. Kessler's death is a reminder that stings can be deadly for those with an allergy to certain insects, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology said Friday. At least 40 people in the United States die each year as the result of insect stings, the academy said. As many as 5 percent of Americans are at risk for a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction from insect stings, according to the organization. In a typical week in the emergency room, doctors at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia, see about six or fewer cases of people with allergic reactions to insects, said Dr. James P. Capes, director of the emergency department. ""It's common, but not incredibly common,"" he said. Typically, when stung by an insect, a person will have no reaction or a mild local reaction, such as redness, swelling or itching at the site of the sting. However, some people experience a more widespread reaction, such as a drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness or hives all over. iReport.com: Send us your allergy stories . In the most serious cases, a person can go into anaphylaxis, a condition in which he or she may have difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include swelling of the mouth or throat, itchy skin, wheezing, cough and localized pain, said Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York. Capes advises people who experience a systemic reaction to call 911 and wait for an ambulance, because it will have medicine to treat the reaction immediately. An antihistamine such as Benadryl will be given and, in severe cases, a shot of epinephrine. Even if the reaction is not severe, Benadryl will help with normal symptoms of insect stings, Capes said. Those who have had allergic reactions to insects should always carry an antihistamine and an epinephrine auto-injector for emergencies, experts said. Insect allergies may be harder to control than some food allergies because it's not always possible to predict when bees, wasps and other stinging bugs are around, Capes said. Severe reactions don't usually happen the very first time a person gets stung, Capes said. ""The thing about allergic reactions that is interesting, or scary, is that we never know what the next allergic reaction is going to be,"" he said. For those who have a history of anaphylactic reactions to insects, vaccines are available for yellow jackets, wasps, honey bees and fire ants, Bassett said. The immunization process takes three to five years, he said. There are also blood and skin tests that people can take to determine whether they are sensitive to these insects, he said. Besides anaphylaxis, people may experience other kinds of reactions, Bassett said. If a person is stung hundreds of times at once, he or she may need emergency care, as the venom may lead to seizures, shock and even death, he said. There is also a rare reaction called serum sickness that includes joint pain and flu-like illness that may result from insect stings, and has allergy-like symptoms, Bassett said. In rare cases, even mosquito bites can lead to anaphylaxis, Bassett said. There is no treatment for mosquito allergies, but there is a diagnostic test, he said. Bassett offers the following tips to reduce the danger of insects: . • Stay away from stinging insect nests when possible. • Consider wearing closed-toed shoes in an area where there may be many stinging insects. • Remain calm and quiet around a stinging insect, and move slowly away from it. • Avoid brightly colored clothing, as well as perfumes and scented hair products and lotions. • Avoid loose-fitting clothing, which can accidentally trap the insect. • Use caution when eating outdoors, especially when sodas or other sweetened drinks are available.

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- ""The Time Traveler's Wife,"" adapted from the 2003 best-seller by Audrey Niffenegger, is one of those gooey romantic mind-benders, like ""Ghost"" (which I adored) or ""The Lake House"" (not so much), in which a couple must come to grips with some trippy impediment to their relationship, such as life after death or a hole in the space-time continuum. Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana star as a couple trying to connect in ""The Time Traveler's Wife."" Only instead of being milked for elaborate science-fiction thrills, the problem at hand gets treated as a weepy and grandiose inconvenience. Sort of like the metaphysical version of having a husband who takes too many business trips. Henry (Eric Bana) is deeply, and eternally, in love with Clare (Rachel McAdams), and she with him. The only problem is that he has a ""genetic anomaly"" that causes him to skip around through time without warning. All of a sudden, he will melt out of the present and pop up ... somewhere else, in the future or in the past, without a stitch of clothing on, so that he must scramble for cover and regain his bearings. Then, just as suddenly, he'll pop back into Clare's life -- sometimes when he's too young a man to have any idea who she is. (A little confused? So was I.) More jarringly, he sometimes appears when he's an adult and she's an adoring young girl standing in a pastoral meadow. That's when she falls in love with him -- which is meant to be innocent, but comes off as a bit unintentionally creepy. I mean, is the movie supposed to look like a contemporary version of ""The Lewis Carroll Story""? To muddle matters further, Henry is seen at assorted ages, but except for the moment when he shows up at his wedding with sudden streaks of gray in his hair, Bana looks exactly the same in every scene. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is built as a game that the audience learns to play, and after a while, yes, we do get the hang of it. That is, we accept the film's mixture of the playful and the slightly arbitrary; we become romantic time travelers too. Although the script is by Bruce Joel Rubin, who wrote ""Ghost,"" the film's mood doesn't change very much; it's gentle, wistful, gauzy, and placid. Bana, so fantastic in ""Munich,"" has always had to work overtime to prove that an actor who looks like the Aussie gym-rat version of Rodin's ""The Thinker"" can play a gentle, unassuming regular guy. But he does nicely here. He and McAdams are sweet together, with matching dimples and starry eyes, and we grow eager to see them remain in the same place. In the end, that's all there is to the movie, really. It's a time-travel fantasy in search of a cozy love seat. EW Grade: B-minus . CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- A clerk's quick flip of a switch foiled a robbery Friday at an Office Depot store in downtown Chicago. Police said a man wearing a light blue button-down shirt and dark slacks entered the store carrying a gun concealed in a folded newspaper. He approached one of the store's cash registers and demanded the contents of the safe, police said. The clerk refused but immediately turned on the public address system so that other customers could hear what was going on. Hearing his threat broadcast throughout the store, the man fled. He ended up robbing a nearby Fannie May candy store at gunpoint, police said, and fled that store in a white taxi. Authorities said the robber, a man between ages 30 and 40, was still at large. No injuries were reported in either robbery.","Store clerk switches on PA system after being threatened by man with gun .

"(CNN) -- With his push for health care reform on the line, the president delivered a message of urgency to the public: . President Bill Clinton, pictured in 1994, greets members of a crowd following a speech on his health care reform plan. ""Don't let the fearmongers, don't let the dividers, don't let the people who disseminate false information frighten the United States Congress into walking away from the opportunity of a lifetime. Tell the members of Congress you will support them. This is not partisan politics,"" the president said. The date was August 1, 1994, and the voice behind the 11th-hour battle cry was then-President Clinton. Within weeks, that battle cry was reduced to a whimper of defeat as Congress tabled plans to vote on his legislation. As President Obama ratchets up the pressure on Congress to pass health care reform this year, he's following in the footsteps of the 42nd president. From his prime time push to his town hall meetings, Obama is taking the same path as Clinton, but hoping for a different ending. Clinton and Obama faced similar climates. Both made health care their signature issue, even though most people were happy with their coverage and were more concerned with fixing the economy. Clinton presented Congress with a plan, whereas Obama instead presented broad guidelines and asked the lawmakers to come up with a bill. ""Much of the complaint about the Clinton-era attempt at this was how complicated it was,"" said Candy Crowley, CNN's senior political correspondent. ""That has not been a complaint this time. But in the overview, there was no doubt that the steady drumbeat of criticism started out at a fairly low level and just has come to this deafening roar, and that's very much like it was in the resistance to the Clinton plan."" Like Clinton, Obama's been accused of waffling on his proposals and failing to reach across the aisle. Following weeks of contentious town hall meetings, Obama this weekend appeared more flexible than ever on the idea of a government-sponsored, public health insurance option. Liberal Democrats have demanded a public option, but some conservatives call such a proposal a deal breaker. Obama has voiced his support for the public option but stopped short of calling it a necessity. At a town hall in Colorado this weekend, however, he called it ""just one sliver"" of reform. ""The public option, whether we have it or we don't have it, is not the entirety of health care reform,"" he said. The White House was quick to insist that the administration's stance has not changed, and sent talking points to congressional Democrats trying to ease concern about the public option. The administration has been ""boringly consistent"" on the issue, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday.  Watch: Is the White House changing its message? » . Clinton was accused of backtracking after he seemed to back down from his stated goal of universal coverage at a 1994 National Governors' Association conference. Democrats protested and the White House insisted that the president's words were misinterpreted. But those reading the tea leaves knew the effort was losing steam. Some Democrats distanced themselves from the president as the 1994 midterm elections neared. Clinton and other key Democrats tried to compromise with a scaled-down version of the president's original plan, but the effort unraveled and eventually faded from the agenda. ""It's the art of dealmaking, and it's not surprising that they would both face this. In the face of huge outcry, presidents or politicians look for a compromise,"" Crowley said. ""When you see the possibility that it could go down in flames, you look for ways to appease the critics of it, and both Clinton, and now it appears Obama, are trying to do that -- to find some way to pass something."" When Congress reconvenes after the August recess, lawmakers will return to a different climate on Capitol Hill, kindled by the protests of those who have been questioning Obama's proposals. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, said last month that if Republicans can stop Obama on health care, ""it will be his Waterloo."" Clinton's agenda was bruised following his health care defeat, but it was his party that was dealt the hardest hits. The Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994 for the first time in 40 years. It took another 12 years to get it back. Mary Matalin, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor, predicted a repeat of history for Obama, should health care fail. ""What is right about conventional wisdom is, he'll be fine, but the Democrats in Congress won't,"" she said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""And you are already hearing Democrats in Congress saying, 'This is deja vu. This is what happened with Bill Clinton. He makes us walk the plank, then we lose,' as they did,"" she said. Clinton acknowledged the political importance of a health care win in his speech before the Netroots Nation convention last week. Passing comprehensive health care legislation, he said, ""is not only the morally right thing to do. It is politically imperative for the Democrats to pass a health care bill now, because one thing we know and that I have lived through is that if you get out there and then you don't prevail, the victors get to rewrite history."" Democratic strategist and CNN contributor James Carville said that since it's clear that Senate Democrats don't have the 60 votes needed to get a full Senate vote, they should instead force Republicans to filibuster the bill. ""Then, you say, 'They're the people that stopped it. We had a majority of Democrats. We had a good bill. They stopped it,' "" said Carville, a former adviser to Clinton. Republicans under the Clinton administration threatened to filibuster, but the warnings proved inconsequential, as the bill never got that far. As health care reaches a turning point for Obama, ""timing is everything,"" Crowley said. ""It's not an election year -- yet. To me, that works on Obama's side, where it didn't with Clinton because the minute it becomes an election year, it's just different, because congressmen, senators are looking at what their constituents are saying back home, and their jobs are on the line,"" Crowley said. But that safety net won't hold for long, and Obama has only a few more months to show whether history will repeat itself or be rewritten. ""I think the time is critical for President Obama because at the end of the year, Congress goes off and takes a recess ... and so you end up having a pretty narrow time frame, and then when they come back in January -- guess what, it's an election year,"" Crowley said.","Bill Clinton, Obama both made health care their signature issue .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Senate on Wednesday narrowly rejected a controversial measure to allow people to carry concealed weapons from state to state. A Miami, Florida, gun store offers concealed weapons training. The measure would have required each of the 48 states that currently allow concealed firearms to honor permits issued in other states. The vote was 58-39 in favor. The amendment needed 60 votes to pass. The vote split the Democrats, with 20 supporting the measure and 35 opposing it. Two of the Senate's 40 Republicans -- Richard Lugar of Indiana and George Voinovich of Ohio -- and both independents, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernard Sanders of Vermont, voted against it. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, all Democrats, did not vote. A coalition of mayors that fought the law welcomed its defeat. ""Our bipartisan coalition of Mayors Against Illegal Guns fought this amendment tooth-and-nail, because we recognize that the laws of one state may not be best for another,"" Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston, Massachusetts, said in a statement. ""We will continue to work with our members to support common-sense policies and oppose dangerous ones, like the Thune Amendment that was defeated today,"" he said, referring to Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, who sponsored the proposal. It was the first significant defeat this year for advocates of gun rights, after gun control advocates faced an unexpected setback in May.  Map: See which states allow citizens to carry concealed weapons » . Gun rights advocates attached a measure allowing people to carry guns in national parks to credit card legislation. President Obama signed the package into law. The interstate concealed-weapons proposal was an amendment to a larger defense appropriations bill. Supporters of the measure argued it would help deter criminals; opponents claimed it would, in effect, force most of the country to conform to regulations in states with the loosest gun-ownership standards. Opponents of the amendment mounted a huge campaign to stop it. Mayors Against Illegal Guns -- which says it represent more than 450 mayors in 40 states -- took out an ad in USA Today opposing the measure. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a campaign co-chairman, opposed the law on a number of grounds, arguing both that it tramples on states' rights and that guns are dangerous. ""There's no evidence that if you have a gun, you're safer,"" he said on CNN's ""American Morning"" Wednesday. ""Quite the contrary. If you have a gun at home, [you are] something like 20 times more likely to have somebody in your house killed. ... ""We have to protect our policemen, protect our citizens. We can't have all these guns, and it's reasonable to have each state make their own laws,"" he said. ""Wyoming shouldn't be subject to New York state laws, and we're going in that direction,"" he said. ""What's right for the people of Wyoming isn't necessarily right for the people of New York and vice versa."" Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who was a co-sponsor of the amendment, had argued that gun licenses should apply across state lines, like driver's licenses. ""People travel,"" he said on ""American Morning."" ""We have truck drivers on our roads, people traveling for vacation in their vehicles, and if you have a license ... you should be able to use that license in other states. It should apply like a driver's license,"" he said. He argued that concealed weapons deter crime. ""Carrying a concealed weapon is a sign of self-defense, self-protection, and I think it lowers crime,"" he said. And he said people carrying guns would still have to obey laws wherever they are. ""The law of the state where that person happens to be at the time are the laws that apply in terms of if you're allowed to carry a gun into a bar or restaurant. ... State rights continue to apply there."" This is the third time the Senate has considered gun rights this year. In addition to the national parks measure, Senate gun-rights advocates in the spring attached a measure loosening the District of Columbia's tight gun control laws to a bill giving full voting rights to Washington's representative in Congress. That amendment was approved 62-36. House Democratic leaders, unwilling to loosen the restrictions on gun ownership in the District of Columbia, have let the bill languish. CNN's Alan Silverleib and Evan Glass in Washington contributed to this report.","Senate turns down proposal to make permits valid despite differing laws .

"(CNN) -- North Korea on Thursday launched a scathing personal attack on U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, raising comparisons with previous colorful comments about the West by the communist regime. Bush: ""A chicken soaked in the rain,"" according to a North Korean Cabinet newspaper. At a meeting of southeast Asian nations in Phuket, Thailand, a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman blasted Clinton for what he called a ""spate of vulgar remarks unbecoming for her position everywhere she went since she was sworn in,"" according to the state-run KCNA news agency. The spokesman called Clinton ""by no means intelligent"" and a ""funny lady."" ""Sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping,"" the statement said. In no particular order, here are some of the most outspoken comments of recent years: . In October 2001, North Korean newspaper Rodong Sinmun said U.S. President George W. Bush was ""an incompetent and rude president who is senseless and ignorant as he does not know even elementary diplomatic etiquette and lacks diplomatic ability."" In March 2002, after Bush bracketed the communist state of Kim Jong-il with Iran and pre-war Iraq as being part of an ""axis of evil,"" the North shot back and called the United States an ""empire of evil,"" KCNA reported. In May 2005, North Korea described Bush as ""a hooligan bereft of any personality as a human being, to say nothing of stature as president of a country. He is a half-baked man in terms of morality and a philistine whom we can never deal with."" In December 2008 after an Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at Bush at a news conference in Baghdad the North's cabinet newspaper said in an article that Bush looked like ""a chicken soaked in the rain,"" according to Reuters.com. In April 2004, a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman described U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney as a ""mentally deranged person steeped in the inveterate enmity towards the system"" in the North. In May 2003, the North said Cheney ""is hated as the most cruel monster and blood-thirsty beast as he has drenched various parts of the world in blood."" In May 2004, the North branded the Grand National Party of South Party a ""vegetable assembly"" and a ""modern brand Nazi party."" In November 2003, after U.S. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld described North Korea as an ""evil country"" and an ""evil regime,"" KCNA shot back, describing him as a ""political dwarf, human scum or hysteric. His hands are stained with the blood shed by so many people. He is, indeed, a human butcher and fascist tyrant who puts an ogre to shame."" In May 2005, after U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described the North as an ""outpost of tyranny,"" a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman described Rice as ""no more than an official of the most tyrannical dictatorial state in the world. Such woman bereft of any political logic is not the one to be dealt with by us."" In May 2009, North Korean newspapers said Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso was ""greedy for power"" and ""incompetent in politics.""

"(CNN) -- She's been a comedian, talk-show host and feared red carpet fashion critic. Now you can add winner of ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" to Joan Rivers' lengthy resume. Donald Trump and Joan Rivers attend ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" season finale Sunday in New York. After weeks of competition, the 75-year-old dynamo beat out 15 other contestants, including Dennis Rodman, Tom Green and Brian McKnight, to take the top spot in this season's edition of the reality show hosted by Donald Trump. Rivers went up against poker champion Annie Duke in Sunday night's finale in which both women were charged with planning a VIP party and silent auction for the last and deciding task. ""They're both tough, they're both smart and they both hate each other,"" Trump observed at the beginning of the show. The apparent tension between Rivers and Duke continued in the final boardroom, part of which played out in front of a live audience, with both finalists bickering and interrupting each other repeatedly as Trump looked on. In the end, Duke raised far more money at her event, but Rivers was able to attract more celebrities and provide a better overall experience for the guests at her party, and Trump declared her the winner of the competition. ""Your level of energy has been amazing,"" he told Rivers. The victory means $250,000 for Rivers' charity: God's Love We Deliver. If the series thrives on conflict, it got plenty of mileage out of Rivers. She blew up at country singer Clint Black, referred to another contestant as a ""stupid blonde"" and smashed a champagne glass out of frustration at one point. But Rivers seemed to be especially infuriated by Duke, calling her a ""despicable human being"" -- the tamest of the insults she hurled in Duke's direction over the course of the series. Rivers even walked out in a huff after her daughter, and fellow contestant, Melissa was fired from the show. The exit, complete with bleeped obscenities, was turned into a cliffhanger of sorts when it seemed like Rivers might not come back, but she returned to the show for the next task. You might think a show that's best known for the phrase ""You're fired"" might not do so well in a bad economy when thousands of people have heard similar words for real at their workplaces, but the series averaged more than 8 million viewers a week, according to Entertainment Weekly. EW: Did the right one win? Revived formula . ""The Apprentice"" made a splash when it debuted in 2004, making a reality television star out of Trump and contestants such as Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth. For several seasons, the series took ambitious young mogul wannabes, divided them into teams and had them compete in tasks that ranged from selling lemonade to creating advertising campaigns for major corporations. The contestants vied for the chance to run one of Trump's companies for a year, and Trump fired someone from the losing team each week until he selected an apprentice. Over the years, ratings for the show gradually declined, but the formula was revived in early 2008 with the first season of ""The Celebrity Apprentice."" The tasks, pressure-cooker atmosphere and boardroom bickering stayed the same, but the competition now featured contestants with varying degrees of fame and focused on raising money for charity. The first ""Celebrity Apprentice"" top spot went to Piers Morgan, the prickly judge on ""Britain's Got Talent"" who made news this spring when he invited singing sensation Susan Boyle to dinner after her memorable performance on the show. Morgan also made several appearances on this season's ""Apprentice,"" sitting in as Trump's ""eyes and ears"" during one episode and interviewing the final four candidates in another. Morgan's aggressive questioning seemed to annoy the celebrities, especially Jesse James, who glared icily at Morgan when he kept asking him why he did not turn to his wife, Sandra Bullock, for help in raising money during the various tasks. Perhaps Bullock might be tempted to try competing on the show herself. NBC announced last month it is bringing back ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" for another installment in the spring of 2010, Entertainment Weekly reported.","Joan Rivers wins this season's ""Celebrity Apprentice""

"(CNN) -- Survivors of a deadly earthquake-triggered tsunami which hit the Samoan islands Tuesday have described how they watched the inrushing sea swallow up coastal towns and villages leaving devastation in its wake. iReporter Alden Tagarino captured this image of the damage caused by the tsunami in Pago Pago.

But officials in the Polynesia region have expressed fears the toll will rise as rescue workers struggle to reach outlying villages submerged and flattened by the wave. American Samoa resident Frances Faumatu told CNN she had fled to Aoloau, the highest village on the island, as the earthquake shook her house. ""All of a sudden we heard on the radio everybody had to run for safety,"" she said. ""Right after the quake, the tsunami came.""

But he said he feared the number of causalities would continue to rise. Around 220,000 people live on the two main islands which make up the nation of Samoa. The population of American Samoa is about 66,000.  See a map of the affected region » . Salamo Laumoli, director of health services at the LBJ Tropical Medical Center in Pago Pago, said he feared more fatalities would turn up as rescue workers strived to access parts of the island severed by damaged infrastructure. ""I thought it was the end of the world,"" said Laumoli. ""I have never felt an earthquake like that before."" Patients at the hospital were briefly moved to higher ground, but they were soon brought back and the hospital is operating, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency said. The airport in the capital of Pago Pago was also operational and being used for emergency flights, FEMA said. A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 cargo plane was scheduled to land Wednesday around noon Eastern time, which coincides with sunrise in the Pacific U.S. protectorate, said Craig Fugate, FEMA administrator. A second C-130 was scheduled to land around 5 p.m. ET. ""The wave came onshore and washed out people's homes,"" said Cinta Brown, an American Samoa homeland security official working at the island's emergency operations center. The same happened on the hard-hit east and west sides of American Samoa, said Brown, who was standing in a parking lot when her sport utility vehicle began rocking left and right. She said she could hear the rattling of metal of a large chain-link fence around the lot. ""It shakes you because you know something else is coming,"" she said. The British Foreign Office said one of the dead in American Samoa was a British national, but no other details were provided. In Tonga, Lord Tuita, the acting prime minister, said at least seven people had been confirmed dead on the northern island of Niuatoputapu. Three others were missing and four people were being treated for serious injuries, he said. ""The hospital on the island is reported to have suffered major damage; telephone communications has been cut as a result of damage to equipment and facilities on the island; homes and government buildings have been destroyed; the airport runway has been severely damaged making it impossible for any fixed wing aircraft to land,"" a statement from the Tongan prime minister's office said.

President Obama declared American Samoa a major disaster area, ordering federal aid to supplement local efforts. ""We keep the many people who have been touched by this tragedy in our thoughts and in our prayers,"" he said. A U.S. Defense Department official said 75 members of the Hawaii National Guard were ordered to American Samoa to begin assisting with medical relief, search and rescue and providing communications capabilities on the island. The unit will bring enough supplies to sustain themselves for 96 hours and its expected more aid from the military could begin flowing in, the official said. The Coast Guard is transporting more than 20 officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to American Samoa, said John Hamill, external affairs officer for FEMA in Oakland, California. The FEMA team will include a variety of debris experts, housing experts, members of the Corps of Engineers, and other disaster relief specialists, Hamill said. The quake generated three separate tsunami waves, the largest measuring 5.1 feet from sea level height, said Vindell Hsu, a geophysicist with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Preliminary data had originally reported a larger tsunami.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Syria and Iraq each recalled their ambassadors from the other country Tuesday, after Baghdad demanded that Damascus hand over two suspects in last week's deadly bombings in the Iraqi capital. Plastic flowers decorate a car destroyed in last week's bombings in Baghdad, Iraq. Syrian state-run news agency SANA reported the government was ordering its ambassador home after the Iraqi government summoned its envoy from Syria and demanded that Damascus turn over two Iraqis living in Syria who played ""direct roles in the execution of the terror attack,"" last Wednesday, Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said in a statement. A string of bombings struck Iraq's capital August 19, with two truck bombs ripping through the Iraqi Finance Ministry and Foreign Ministry. At least 100 people were killed and hundreds more were wounded in Baghdad's bloodiest day since U.S. troops handed over security control to Iraqi forces and moved outside Iraqi cities nearly two months ago. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki visited the Foreign Ministry bombing site Tuesday. ""We know it was the Baath Party, known for its heinous crimes throughout history, along with al Qaeda, who did this,"" he said, according to his office. The Islamic State of Iraq, the umbrella group for al Qaeda in Iraq, has claimed responsibility for the attack, which Syria condemned. ""Syria felt pain over those bombings and strongly condemned them, describing those explosions as painful terrorist bombings and reiterating the Syrian support to the security, stability, safety and unity of Iraq,"" SANA reported. ""But what is regretful is the hastiness of the Iraqi government to arbitrarily accuse Syria while analysts say the issue was internal political or, perhaps, foreign disagreements."" The Iraqi government asked Tuesday that Syria ""hand over all those wanted [by the Iraqi judiciary] for committing crimes of murder and destruction against the Iraqi people,"" al-Dabbagh's statement said. It further demanded that Syria expel ""terrorist organizations that use Syria as a headquarters and launchpad to plan terrorist operations against the Iraqi people."" SANA reported that the Syrian government was willing to help the Iraqis investigate the bombings. ""Syria informed the Iraqi side of its readiness to receive an Iraqi delegation to inspect the evidence available to them concerning the bombings' perpetrators,"" a Syrian official said, according to SANA. ""Otherwise Syria considers what has been broadcast through the Iraqi media as mere fabricated evidence intended to serve internal political goals, and the conflicting and contradicting statements by the Iraqi officials are proof of that."" The official added, ""Syria, which has frequently repeated its keenness on the unity, independence, security and stability of Iraq, expresses its regret that relations between Syria and Iraq have become subject to internal disagreements and perhaps foreign agendas."" In its claim of responsibility for the attacks, the Islamic State of Iraq said, ""The earth shook under their feet and their hearts were torn in fear and horror. ... And the weakness and fragility of their state became apparent to everyone."" The statement was posted on Web sites typically used by the group. The Iraqi government released on Sunday what it said was a confession from a man who said he received orders for the bombing of the Finance Ministry building from a member of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's Baath Party who now lives in Syria. The videotaped statement from Wissam Ali Kadhim Ibrahim, who was identified as a former Baathist police official, aired on Iraqi television. Ibrahim said he received orders from Sattam Farhan, who he said was a Baath Party leader in Syria. Farhan and Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed, a former senior member of Hussein's regime, are the two men Iraq demands Syria turn over. The Iraqi government put al-Ahmed as the No. 2 man on a most wanted list it released in 2006, and the U.S. government announced a $1 million reward for him two years earlier. The spokesman for al-Ahmed's wing of the Baath Party in Syria contended Monday that the videotaped statement was fabricated and alleged that the man could have been paid to make it. The spokesman said the paths and ideologies of the party could never meet with those of al Qaeda, and blamed the attacks on struggles between Shiite parties in Iraq. Some midlevel and senior members of the Baath party sought refuge in Syria after the U.S. invasion that ousted Hussein in 2003. Al-Maliki asked for the handover of some of those ex-officials during a visit to Damascus last week, Iraqi officials said.","Iraqi PM says ""we know"" bombings were done by al Qaeda and Baath Party .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The Iraqi government says it has banned all organized visits to Saddam Hussein's grave amid concern over support for the late dictator's former party. An Iraqi poet, left, gives a recital while children carry pictures of Saddam Hussein over his grave. A Cabinet statement on Monday said it had directed authorities in Salaheddin province and the Education Ministry to ""take all necessary measures"" to prevent such outings. The former dictator, along with his two sons and other relatives, is buried in his hometown of al-Ouja near Tikrit in Salaheddin north of Baghdad. And, Hussein supporters and schoolchildren have made visits there on the late dictator's birthday and hanging date. There have been videos on sites such as YouTube of people at the site. One video shows schoolchildren at the grave in December; they carried banners at Hussein's grave that said ""We won't forget you father"" and they read pro-Hussein poetry. The government move was made after a recent visit by schoolchildren to the grave, but no reason was given for the decision. However, the move reflects the concern of Iraq's government over the presence of the Baath Party in Iraq, Saddam Hussein's political movement. The party and its symbols have been banned in Iraq. On Saturday, government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told reporters that while there can be government reconciliation with individual Baathists who have not committed crimes such as killing Iraqis, there can never be national reconciliation with the party itself. Salaheddin Gov. Mutasher Hussein Alaiwi, said he had not received any official directives yet, but said he would implement Cabinet orders when he receives them. The governor said that would apply to organized group visits, but they would not stop individual ones. A resident of al-Ouja told CNN the government had no right to stop visitors from going to their former president's tomb. ""Even if they put police and army outside the door, they will not stop us from visiting our president, our leader and our father,"" said Mohammed al- Nasiri. Hussein was executed in 2006 after an Iraqi court sentenced him to death for crimes against humanity.","Iraqi government bans all organized visits to Saddam Hussein's grave .

"(AOL Autos) -- Automotive expert Tom Torbjornsen answers a question about how to diagnose an exhaust problem and what to do about it. Dear Tom, Smoke is coming out of the tailpipe of my 2002 Chrysler Sebring with 90,000 miles. Is this a big problem? I have to put a quart of oil a week in the engine. What should I do? -- Sally, New York . Sally, Generally, engines burn oil due to a few reasons: bad valve seals, worn valve guides, pressurized crankcase (oil pan) due to a clogged PCV valve or breather system, and blow-by from worn piston rings. Bad valve seals: The valves are located in the cylinder head above the combustion chamber. Oil is pumped at 40 to 80 PSI (pounds/square inch) of pressure into the top of the head, lubricating the valve-train. The valves have seals to stop the flow of oil down into the engine when the valve is open. If the seals fail then oil is allowed to flow down into the combustion chamber and is burned. Worn valve guides: A small cylindrical chamber called a valve guide does just what its name says ... it guides the valves. These guides wear out over time causing eccentricity (slop). The excess gap that forms allows oil to flow down the valve stem into the combustion chamber to be burned. Normally the valve seal stops this flow. However, in this case the gap is too great for the seal to work. AOL Autos: Should you use synthetic motor oil? Pressurized crankcase due to clogged PCV or breather system: Your car's engine is a giant air pump, consequently it must breathe. The PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) system allows the engine to exhaust the excess pressure buildup (which is a natural phenomenon of the internal combustion engine). Carbon is a by-product of an engine and can build up in the PCV system, clogging the breathing passages. This in turn pressurizes the oil pan and pushes oil up into the fuel delivery system where it is fed into the engine and burned. AOL Autos: Do I need to replace my air filter? Blow-by from worn piston rings: The pistons in your car's engine have seals around them in the form of rings. These rings have two functions: (1) they seal the combustion chamber so that the power developed from the firing of the cylinder is not lost. (2) They provide vital lubrication to the cylinder walls. When the rings wear out, the pressure from combustion reverses down into the oil pan, pressurizing it, and forcing oil into the valve covers. From there it goes through the breather system, back into the fuel delivery system, and into the engine to be burned. I have to put a quart of oil a week in the engine. Is this a big problem? It's hard to say without performing some diagnostics on the engine. A quart of oil a week is excessive. It could be due to a plugged PCV or excessive internal engine wear. Take the car into the shop for engine diagnostics. My guess is that the tech will perform a compression test along with a cylinder leak down test after he/she determines if the PCV system is open. During these tests the tech tries to determine if there is loss of engine compression, blow-by, or excessive oil consumption due to ring wear. If excessive ring wear is discovered then further engine teardown will be necessary to determine if the engine needs to be rebuilt or replaced. AOL Autos: How often should you change your oil . What is the difference between blue and white smoke? The engine can emit different colors of smoke: . Blue smoke: Blue typically means that engine oil is being burned in the combustion chamber. In rare cases, when a vehicle is equipped with a transmission that uses a device called a vacuum modulator valve (to soften shifts between gears according to engine vacuum) the diaphragm can break inside the valve and cause transmission fluid to be sucked into the engine via the vacuum line feeding the valve and burn. AOL Autos: Fluid leaks: unsafe and expensive . White smoke: White can mean one of two things. (1) Water condensation from a blown and leaking head gasket: This gasket is the seal between the cylinder head and engine block. Water runs through channels called water jackets that line the cylinder walls and thus carry away heat. When the head gasket blows, the seal between the cylinder head and engine block breaks and water is allowed to enter the combustion chamber. This water is emitted from the engine in the form of water vapor or steam and it is white in color. (2) Excessive gas: Fuel delivery systems sometimes falter and dump excessive amounts of raw fuel into the intake plenum. When this happens, the amount of fuel is too much for the engine to process. Hence, it exits the engine and tailpipe in the form of pure white fuel vapor. It stinks like raw gas and can be dangerous if it ignites in the hot muffler and catalytic converter. I have witnessed exhaust systems literally blown off the vehicle from the explosion that ensued from ignition of a gas-filled catalytic converter. This condition must be fixed immediately to prevent internal engine damage or worse yet, a serious fire. Can I add oil or coolant and keep driving the vehicle until I can afford to fix it? Yes. However, be advised that such maladies never get better by themselves; and they always get worse with time. There is a real possibility that you will get caught on the road driving at highway speeds (thinking you added enough oil, transmission fluid or engine coolant) and the oil runs out, causing a catastrophic failure. In general, when it comes to a need for auto repair, conditions never improve on their own. You must maintain your vehicle if you want to get the maximum life out of it and, in the long run, spend the least amount of money.

"(CNN) -- William Safire, a onetime speechwriter for President Nixon who became a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The New York Times, has died at age 79, the newspaper announced Sunday. William Safire died in Maryland following a battle with pancreatic cancer, The New York Times reported. Safire joined the Times as a columnist in 1973. In addition to his conservative news columns, which he wrote until 2005, he wrote a language column for the paper's Sunday magazine from 1979 until shortly before his death. He won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1978. In 2006, President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. civilian honor. Safire had suffered from pancreatic cancer and died Sunday at a hospice in Rockville, Maryland, the newspaper reported. Born in New York in 1929, Safire began his career as a reporter for newspapers, television and radio stations after dropping out of Syracuse University. After becoming a public relations executive in the late 1950s, he was credited with putting together the 1959 ""kitchen debate"" between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev at that year's American National Exhibition in Moscow. Safire was the publicist for a builder at the time. ""What I was publicizing was the typical American house,"" he recounted during a conference at George Washington University in July. ""It was my kitchen."" The next year, he went to work for Nixon's first, unsuccessful presidential bid. He rejoined the Nixon team in 1968, when the Republican eventually won the White House, and became one of the administration's top speechwriters. Perhaps his best-known line in that job was Vice President Spiro Agnew's denunciation of journalists as ""nattering nabobs of negativism."" But Safire left the administration to join that nattering club in 1973, when he left the Nixon administration to join the Times. His often-pugnacious voice -- he once denounced then-first lady Hillary Clinton as a ""congenital liar"" -- held down the right flank of the Times' op-ed page for more than three decades. He won his Pulitzer in 1978 for columns on the travails surrounding Bert Lance, who as President Carter's budget director in 1977 resigned amid allegations of bank fraud. Lance was acquitted by a federal jury in 1980. And he was an outspoken advocate of the plight of Iraq's Kurdish population. He sharply criticized U.S. support for Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, when Hussein used poison gas to put down a Kurdish revolt, and he strongly supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, writing that ""nobody came out of this war more nobly"" than the Kurds. Safire also wrote four novels, several collections of columns and a political dictionary that was first published in 1968. A new edition came out in 2008. He is survived by his wife, Helene, two children and one grandchild.","William Safire dies at age 79, according to New York Times .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A Marine was killed in action and several others wounded Thursday in a major U.S.-led offensive in southern Afghanistan, the Marines said. U.S. Marines prepare for Operation Khanjar at Forward Operating Base Dwyer, Afghanistan, on Thursday. The push, called Operation Khanjar, is targeting militants in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold and poppy-growing region. The forces are attempting to gain and hold ground in the perilous region ahead of national elections in August. Almost 4,000 Marines and sailors, along with several hundred Afghan security forces and British troops, worked to clear Taliban militants from population centers in the Helmand River valley. They have been operating in the districts of Nawa and Garmsir in central Helmand province and ""as far south as the vicinity of Khan Neshin, the capital of Rig district in the region of the Helmand River valley known as 'The Fishhook.' "" The Marines stressed the mission ""is to provide security for population centers"" and ""connect local citizens with their legitimate government while establishing stable and secure conditions for national elections."" Helmand's governor, Gulab Mangal, said he believes the operation will work and has assured the populace that it will provide security for them. His spokesman also confirmed that resistance had been minimal. The Marines said about 80 percent of the American troops are in direct combat, with the rest working in support. Taliban resistance has been light and sporadic, consisting of intermittent small arms fire, the Marines said on Thursday. The troops have encountered only relatively small groups of militants. ""Indications are the militants break away shortly after they make contact,"" Marine spokesman 1st Lt. Abe Sipe said, referring to what is regarded as the Taliban's habit of running and hiding after troops confront them. A Taliban spokesman said the group's fighters had killed 33 soldiers and destroyed several vehicles. CNN could not independently verify the Taliban claims because of safety and access issues. There has been an outcry in Afghanistan over civilian deaths in the Afghan war's crossfire, with much ire directed toward coalition air operations. But the Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan emphasized in a news release that the Marines have not ""received any confirmed reports of civilian casualties or damage to property."" They said they have not utilized ""artillery or other indirect fire weapons, and no bombs have been dropped from aircraft."" The brigade operates under NATO's International Security Assistance Force. The assault has prompted Pakistani authorities to redeploy troops along the Afghan border to stop Taliban from escaping the push in Helmand. More than 30 U.S., British and Danish troops have been killed there since January, with the latest being the Marine on Thursday and a pair of British soldiers slain in Helmand on Wednesday. The push is the largest since the Pentagon began moving additional troops into the conflict this year, and it comes after a British-led operation launched last week in the same region, the Marines said. When President Obama announced his strategy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan, he said American soldiers and Marines ""will take the fight to the Taliban in the south and the east, and give us a greater capacity to partner with Afghan security forces and to go after insurgents along the border."" He also said the bolstered deployment ""will also help provide security"" ahead of August presidential elections in Afghanistan. The Obama administration has moved about 21,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan, the original front in the war launched after the September 11 attacks. It is also the first big move since U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal took over as the allied commander in Afghanistan in mid-June. In Washington, a senior defense official said the size and scope of the new operation are ""very significant."" ""It's not common for forces to operate at the brigade level,"" the official said. ""In fact, they often only conduct missions at the platoon level. And they're going into the most troubled area of Afghanistan."" The defense official said the operation is a ""tangible indication"" of the new approach that McChrystal -- a former chief of the Pentagon's special operations command -- is bringing to the nearly eight-year war. ""They're not just doing an offensive push to get bad guys; they're going in to hold the area and stay there,"" the official said. ""This approach is indicative of McChrystal's philosophy: measuring success by the number of Afghans protected, not bad guys killed."" During his confirmation hearing in June, McChrystal told senators that the conflict requires a new focus on counterinsurgency to reduce violence and build support for the U.S.-led NATO alliance among Afghans. ""Although I expect stiff fighting ahead, the measure of success will not be enemy killed. It will be shielding the Afghan population from violence,"" he said. The Islamic fundamentalist Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan before its allies in al Qaeda attacked New York and Washington on September 11, 2001. Though quickly toppled after the attacks, its leaders escaped, and the movement regrouped in the Afghan countryside and across the border in Pakistan. Helmand was once known as the breadbasket of Afghanistan, but the fertile land is now used for growing poppies. Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world's opium, with most of that coming from the poppies in Helmand. The drug trade is an import source of income for the Taliban and major supply routes run through the province. CNN's Atia Abawi in Afghanistan, Nic Robertson in Pakistan and Chris Lawrence and Barbara Starr at the Pentagon contributed to this report.","One Marine killed, others wounded; Taliban says 33 soldiers killed .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Airline passengers who were trapped on tarmacs ""like sardines in a can"" had their opportunity to air their grievances Tuesday at an unofficial Capitol Hill hearing that shared some of the characteristics of those flights. The hearing was sponsored by advocates of the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights. The hearing was overbooked: The room had more participants than seats. The take-off was slightly delayed: The hearings started five minutes late. And, appropriately, it lasted more than three hours, the maximum time passenger advocates say people should be confined on the ground. The hearing was sponsored by advocates of the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights, which would require airlines to give passengers the option of leaving a plane after it has sat on the ground for three hours. The proposal, which lacked adequate support in 2007 and 2008, has gained steam this year because of several highly publicized incidents, including a nearly six-hour overnight wait involving a regional jet in Rochester, Minnesota. ""We were not offered food. We were not offered water,"" said Link Christin, one of 47 passengers on the Rochester plane. ""The toilet broke at about 3 o'clock in the morning, and it was impossible to sleep. Either Baby One cried, or Baby Two cried, or my foot got stepped on by somebody going to the bathroom."" ""People have asked me, 'Why didn't you do something?' "" he said. ""As a practical matter, you're a little bit in shock; you're in survival mode. You're being told every hour that you're going to get off. ... There was always a carrot in front of us that we think is going to get us off the plane. And I suggest to you that that's why 47 people did not mutiny that evening."" The star witness for the passenger advocates was Robert Crandall, former chairman and chief executive of American Airlines, who spoke in support of the three-hour limit. ""We can and we should solve the problem of extraordinarily long tarmac delay by imposing reasonable obligations on the airlines and other agencies that make up our aviation system,"" Crandall said. But he added that he favors a looser four-hour limit until 2011 to give the industry time to adjust operating procedures. Crandall said the industry's resistance to the rule is rooted in its ""preoccupation with safety."" The industry resists any change ""that is not fully understood and has not been thought through in every detail,"" he said. He said he believes that the rule can be made without affecting safety. While saying that lengthy tarmac delays can have significant impacts on individuals, he said the problem is statistically small. In the first seven months of this year, only 776 of 3.8 million flights -- or 0.02 percent -- experienced tarmac delays of more than three hours, he said. Sen. Barbara Boxer, sponsor of the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights, called her bill ""extremely modest,"" saying many passenger advocates want even tighter time limits. The rule would give pilots discretion to keep passengers on board longer than three hours for safety reasons, such as lightning storms, or if the pilot believed that the plane would take off shortly. But two hearing participants testified that a three-hour rule could worsen the situation, increasing the number of canceled flights. ""I don't believe the three-hour rule will actually change things very much at all, given the small number of affected flights,"" said Amy Cohn, an associate professor at the University of Michigan. ""And when it does change things, I think some passengers may be helped, and others may be harmed."" If one passenger insists on being released, Cohn said, the plane would return to the terminal, possibly delaying departure for everyone else on the plane. Cohn said the focus on extremely lengthy delays is also diverting attention from the more pressing problem of routine delays. If Congress fixed routine delays, it would help alleviate lengthy delays, she said. Tuesday's hearing was sponsored by FlyersRights.org and the Business Travel Coalition. And though it was held in a House of Representatives office building, it was not an official House hearing. Writers and editors for travel industry publications took the place of members of Congress in questioning the witnesses. Organizers said the top airline industry organization declined to participate.","Unofficial Capitol Hill hearing addressed concerns over long tarmac delays .

"(CNN)  -- An American convicted of being an al Qaeda operative was resentenced to life in prison Monday in a Virginia courtroom after an appeals court ruled his 30-year prison sentence was too lenient. Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, seated far left, appears in an artist's rendering of a March 2005 court hearing. Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, a native of Falls Church, Virginia, was convicted in November 2005 of conspiring with al Qaeda and involvement in a possible plot to assassinate then-President George W. Bush. A federal appeals court, however, ruled the lower court did not sentence Abu Ali harshly enough and that its deviance from federal sentencing guidelines was unjustified. ""The defendant sought to destabilize our government and to shake it to its core,"" according to the 2008 ruling. ""To this day, he wishes he had succeeded. ... It is not too much to ask that a sentencing proceeding not lose sight of the immensity and scale of wanton harm that was and remains Abu Ali's plain and clear intention."" Abu Ali was resentenced to life in prison, federal prosecutors told CNN on Monday. In June 2003, Saudi Arabian authorities detained Abu Ali in Medina, where he was participating in religious studies. During his 20-month detention in Saudi Arabia, he confessed to being a member of al Qaeda and to discussing the execution of a number of terrorist plots, including one to assassinate Bush. Prosecutors offered no evidence that those discussions morphed into a specific plan. However, they maintained that Abu Ali discussed boarding a U.S.-bound plane from Australia or England and flying it into targets on the U.S. East Coast. Abu Ali's attorneys argued that his confessions were false and obtained through torture in Saudi Arabia before he was transported to the United States in February 2005. At his 2006 sentencing, Abu Ali faced a sentence of 20 years to life, and prosecutors maintained that ""only a life sentence will protect the citizens of the United States from the defendant attacking again."" But U.S. District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee rejected that claim, saying there was no evidence Abu Ali took any steps within the United States to further the conspiracies. In sentencing Abu Ali, Lee quoted extensively from letters he received from his friends, family and others endorsing Abu Ali's character. But the appeals court said it was unmoved. ""What person of 'good character' aims to destroy thousands of fellow human beings beings who are innocent of any transgressions against him? This is not good character as we understand it, and to allow letters of this sort to provide the basis for such a substantial variance would be to deprive 'good character' of all its content."" Abu Ali's 30-year sentence was to be followed by 30 years of supervised release.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- An underemployed Spanish matador is breaking tradition and carrying advertising on his capes in the bullring -- promoting a soft drink aimed at gays. Matador Joselito Ortega in an exhibition fight on Sept. 23 in the southern Spanish city of Malaga. While fighting bulls, matador Joselito Ortega will use capes embroidered with the words ""Gay Up,"" the name of the energy drink. The move has many in the macho-steeped world of bullfighting seeing red. But Ortega, 29, told CNN, ""I'm glad to be the first person (in bullfighting) whom the gay community will take as an icon."" ""People think the bullfighter is very tough, very rude and they only like women,"" Ortega added. ""But we are in 2009. Everything must change."" Industry experts said it would be the first time advertising will appear on bullfighter's capes -- the large one used when the bull rushes into the ring, and a smaller one used later as the matador moves in for the kill. In the 1980s, matador Luis Reina had a contract showing the brand name of Japanese electronics giant Akai on parts of his shiny ""suit of lights,"" while fighting. ""But that lasted just one or two fights,"" recalls Curro Vazquez, a former bullfighter who now manages one of Spain's top-tier matadors, Cayetano Rivero Ordonez. Rivero Ordonez has declined offers to carry publicity on his bullfighter's suit and capes while in the ring, Vazquez said, out of respect for ""the ritual of bullfighting."" ""The cape is a sacred thing,"" said Vazquez, adding that it's fine for premier bullfighters -- who are treated like rock stars -- to have lucrative endorsement deals for products, but only outside of the ring. This is the first endorsement deal of any kind for Ortega. He became a full matador in 2006, facing the biggest bulls, but said he's fought only six or seven fights since then. Yet a bullfighter in demand can have dozens of fights in just a single season. ""Ortega is a new bullfighter and he might see this as a way to get known,"" Vazquez said. If so, it appears to be working. Ortega and his drinks company have been flooded with media queries since they made the announcement this week. Pedro Suarez, the CEO at Grupo Banus Pi, the firm that makes Gay Up and took over management of Ortega's career just two weeks ago, said they plan to organize an exhibition fight for Ortega soon, and sell the TV rights exclusively. Gay Up is a non-alcoholic energy drink made in Spain, drawn from a formula originally from Colombia. Suarez said the company tried to sponsor a Spanish football (soccer) team but was turned down because of the Gay Up brand. Then they found Ortega, who says he's not gay. He's been gored six or seven times in his career, which started 13 years ago as a junior bullfighter. ""All sports teams have advertising on their uniforms,"" Ortega said, insisting he'd continue to fight bulls the same way, even with ads on his capes. Bull breeder Juan Pedro Domecq Morenes welcomed the change, saying it might help revive Spain's billion-dollar bullfighting industry, which he said in recent years has seen a 45 percent decline in the number of fights, especially in smaller village bullrings. ""Only God is sacred,"" said Domecq, who also publishes a bullfighting Web site. ""The rest of the traditions have to advance, modernize.""","Matador Joselito Ortega will use capes embroidered with the words ""Gay Up""

"(CNN) -- Michigan's Supreme Court issued an order Tuesday allowing lower state courts to ""exercise reasonable control"" over the appearance of witnesses and parties, a rule change proposed after a Muslim woman refused to remove an Islamic garment in a small claims court. A niqab is a garment that covers the entire face and head, except for the eyes. The order allows courts ""reasonable control over the appearance of parties and witnesses"" so as to ""ensure that the demeanor of such persons may be observed and assessed by the fact-finder and ensure the accurate identification of such person."" The order, which amends a rule of the Michigan Rules of Evidence, is effective September 1. The amendment was prompted by a 2006 small claims case in Michigan filed by Ginnah Muhammad, who wore a niqab -- a garment that covers the entire face and head, except for the eyes -- to court, the order said. According to the Detroit Free Press, Muhammad was contesting a $2,750 repair bill from a car rental company because she said thieves broke into the vehicle she was using. As she prepared to testify, Judge Paul Paruk asked her to remove her niqab, saying he needed to be able to see her face to tell whether she was telling the truth, according to court documents. ""I can't see certain things about your demeanor and temperament that I need to see in a court of law,"" Paruk said at the time. Muhammad refused, saying that she was a practicing Muslim and would take off the veil only in front of a female judge. Paruk said a female judge was not available and told Muhammad she could remove the niqab or have her case dismissed -- she chose the latter, according to court documents. She sued the judge in federal district court, which declined to exercise jurisdiction over the case. Muhammad has since appealed to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations issued a statement saying that if the amended rule was interpreted broadly, it could ""not only adversely affect Muslim females who wear the head scarf, but could also be used to violate Jewish, Sikh, and other people of faiths' constitutional rights under the First Amendment while in Michigan courts."" It added, ""As a civil rights advocacy group, CAIR-MI is concerned about individuals who may be reluctant to report crimes or petition the courts out of fear that their religious rights may be violated."" Other religious groups, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and domestic violence groups, had opposed the rule change, the Detroit Free Press reported. The ACLU had asked that the court add a sentence to the rule saying ""that no person shall be precluded from testifying on the basis of clothing worn because of a sincerely held belief,"" the newspaper reported in May. CAIR also said that it would announce on Wednesday the filing of a federal lawsuit against a Wayne County, Michigan, judge who had asked a Muslim woman to remove her head scarf in court. ""The Muslim plaintiff felt so intimidated by the judge's repeated demand that she eventually removed her head scarf,"" the organization said in a statement released Tuesday. CAIR-MI is a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit being filed on behalf of the Michigan woman, who is a member of the group. Last month, the Judicial Council of Georgia adopted a policy allowing religious head coverings in the state's courtrooms, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported.","Courts allowed ""exercise reasonable control"" over appearance of witnesses .

"(CNN) -- English football star Steven Gerrard has admitted punching a man in a bar, but the Liverpool captain insisted in his court testimony that it was in self-defense. England international Steven Gerrard is in court defending his actions after a bar brawl late last year. The 29-year-old is facing a charge of affray after an incident in the early hours of December 29, when he attacked businessman Marcus McGee following a dispute about the music that was being played. If found guilty, Gerrard faces a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a fine of $7,200. Gerrard, who denies the charge, told a judge on Thursday that he was sorry about his actions in Southport's Lounge Inn, but at the time he thought McGee was going to attack him. They had been involved in an argument after Gerrard tried to change the music on the bar's sound system, but McGee would not let him, the UK Press Association reported. ""I thought he was going to hit me,"" Gerrard said. ""He was on his way forward to me and his behavior had changed from when I was having a discussion with him. I didn't know why."" Gerrard said he was unaware that his friend John Doran had already punched McGee when he himself started to hit the 34-year-old. ""I am certainly mistaken in thinking he was coming towards me to throw punches at me,"" the midfielder said. ""Now I know, obviously, he had been struck, reacted and thought the strike was by me and he came into me and that's when I reacted. I am sorry about the whole incident. ""I grabbed the back of his jumper as he moved forward to me. When I had hold of Marcus, I remember swinging my right hand two or three times. ""I was trying to stop still and I felt I had arms all over me. I could see a melee around Marcus McGee. When I was getting pulled away I realized people were patting me, some of whom were my friends. ""I wanted to help control the situation. I was worried the fight I had with Marcus was going to get worse because people were going past me in that direction."" Gerrard said that his friends had earlier told him to ""forget"" the argument, but he felt he needed to confront McGee. ""I couldn't understand why the guy had such a problem with me, why he was so aggressive,"" he said. ""I was also concerned that if I did leave it I would not have been able to enjoy my night, he may have come over to me. ""I wanted to see why he had such a problem with it, why a total stranger had such a problem with me putting my favorite songs on. I asked why I couldn't have an input in the music and tried to explain that I had permission from the manageress."" ""I asked Marcus what was the problem with the music machine and why he treated me like that. Very quickly he came off the bar stool and was in my face right by me."" Gerrard had been celebrating after scoring two goals as Liverpool thrashed Newcastle 5-1 to remain top of the Premier League, and admitted that he had been drinking alcohol. ""I certainly knew I had had a drink. I was certainly in control of how I felt in my surroundings,"" he said. The father of two said he had not been in trouble with the police since the age of 19, when he was banned from driving for nine months for drink-driving.","English football star Steven Gerrard has admitted punching a man in a bar .

"ON THE ATLANTIC OCEAN (CNN) -- Up on the Lido Deck there is a rockin' band playing another love song. Rush of Fools gets the crowd going during an afternoon concert on the Lido Deck. Hundreds of people, many clad in bikinis or swim trunks, maneuver deck chairs, trying to maximize their worship time in the sun. Servers mill around the deck, trying to interest potential patrons in fruity concoctions. Other cruisers peer back at the band as they stand in the buffet line for an afternoon snack. The band stops, thanks the crowd for joining them on the ship and talks about why they are here. They are here to praise God. This is the K-Love Friends and Family Cruise, a four-day Christian music retreat filled with concerts from all types of bands that share one message. ""You look out at that ocean and you realize you are looking at a very small chunk of the big picture,"" says David Carr, drummer for the contemporary Christian band Third Day. ""It reminds me of how small we are and how big and expansive God is, yet He still loves us."" More than 3,000 fans are on board the Destiny for this floating meet-and-greet bound for Grand Turk. Premier Christian Cruises has chartered the whole ship and has filled each day with concerts, shows and speakers. It's the sixth time Premier has put on this event. The Destiny, owned by Carnival Cruise Lines, is the largest ship the group has ever chartered, says Gary Gentry, one of three owners of Premier. It's one of three full-ship and one partial charter the company puts on each year. The Friends and Family Cruise features 15 bands as well as comedians, an illusionist and speakers. You can see an author in the morning, a rock band in the afternoon, a singer-songwriter in the evening and a big band late at night. ""To me, life is about making moments,"" Gentry says. ""I think that's what we have been able to do on the cruise, help people create moments of significance in their lives."" He compared putting all the bands together on a ship with some of their most loyal fans to the amateur chemistry sets kids love to play with to surprising results. ""You don't know what's gonna happen, but you know it's going to be kinda cool."" Music cruises have been around for decades but charters are a growing trend in the cruise industry. Each year more companies are renting entire ships not only for Christian artists but for all genres of music. There are events for jazz fans, rock fans, even polka fans. Andy Levine runs Sixthman, a music cruise organizer that connects fans with artists such as John Mayer, Sister Hazel and Emmylous Harris. He says his company is thinking about expanding from five rock music-themed cruises to seven this year and eventually nine. Levine used to work in the music industry and said there are so many walls now between performers and fans that there's almost no real interaction between them any more. ""Going on a cruise with your favorite artists is one of the coolest ways to make a real pure connection,"" Levine says by phone, before boarding a ship full of Barenaked Ladies fans. The biggest challenge for charter companies is to convey to fans the premium costs that come with a music-themed cruise compared to a standard voyage. (Rooms on the K-Love cruise for 2010 run between $599 and $6,600 and it is already 80 percent sold out.) ""If they were to go to a music festival instead they would have to pay a small fortune, more than they would on a music cruise,"" says Linda Coffman, who operates the Web site cruisediva.com and has sailed on more than 100 cruises. ""There are hotel costs, food costs and ticket costs, so when you consider all the things included on the ship, music cruises are a good deal."" She adds that one thing you can't put a value on is included in the cruise. Many of the artists will stop and chat with the fans out on deck or in the hallways. Or if a fan sees their favorite singer walking around the pool, it's often OK to ask for a quick picture. (Most cruises do set up autograph sessions and tell fans that is the best time for such requests). It's not only cool for the fans, who might find themselves standing in a buffet line right next to the bass player in their favorite band, it's also cool for the artists, who get to see up close what they mean to people. A woman approached bassist Tai Anderson on the K-Love cruise to tell him how much Third Day meant to her during what had been a painful divorce. She told him how every morning she went for a run, and played their music while she tried to jog away her sorrow. ""Christian music can be an easy target for people to make fun of,"" Anderson says. ""[Critics say] it's derivative or not its own style but at the same time when I see people have connections like that, it encourages me because it's a pretty incredible thing."" Fans sometimes also get to see reunions of bands that haven't played together in years. No one had to ask Kirk Sullivan twice to come on what was his 15th Christian music-themed cruise. Sullivan has been a solo artist for the past two and half years, since the group he sang with for 15 years, 4Him, disbanded. But the folks from Premier called him up and said they wanted the group to do one more show. Sullivan, who has an album due out this spring, loved the chance to see some old friends. ""I think what I miss is seeing them on a regular basis,"" Sullivan says. ""There's not anybody else I'd rather stand on stage with."" As he talks, a woman stops by the table to say hello. She tells him how much she enjoyed the show. He promises to come by and chat with her later. He explains that she and her husband attended a lot of 4Him shows and he's seen her on past cruises. The cruises also give the performers a chance to see other artists for more than just a passing moment, he said. Most musicians rarely get to hang out because of their schedules but on the cruise, band members get a chance to catch concerts themselves and share dinner conversations with artists who are, as one performer said, in the same boat, so to speak. Fans get a similar experience, says Stacy Conville, a doctor from Louisiana. ""It's refreshing to get away from the world and all that's going on,"" she says. ""And to do it with other believers is encouraging.""","K-Love Friends and Family Cruise is a Christian music retreat .

"NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) -- The accused came from all walks of life: Retirees, dads and twentysomethings. An engineer, a business owner and an auto worker. A man in a wheelchair. Men in need of Spanish or Farsi translators. Brett Beasley, with Nashville's Health Department, educates men arrested for trying to buy sex about STDs. About 40 men somberly entered a classroom on a recent Saturday morning. About half of them wore shiny wedding bands. All had tried to buy a prostitute's services and were caught by police. It was their first offense, and a county court referred them to a one-day program called the John School. It's a program run by volunteers and city officials in conjunction with Magdalene House, a nonprofit that works to get prostitutes off the streets. ""Prostitution doesn't discriminate,"" said Kenny Baker, a cognitive behavioral therapist who is the program's director. ""Most of these men don't have a prior criminal history, so our goal is to help these folks understand why they put themselves in a bad position, to prevent it from happening again."" Set in a church in Nashville, Tennessee, the John School is led by former prostitutes, health experts, psychologists and law enforcement officers who talk to -- and at times berate -- the men about the risks of hiring a prostitute. Prostitution is based on the law of supply and demand. The thinking is: Women won't stop selling sex until men stop buying. So Nashville and a growing number of cities are shifting their focus from locking up suppliers to educating buyers. Across the country, about 50 communities are using John Schools. Atlanta, Georgia, and Baltimore, Maryland, are among dozens more cities that plan to launch similar programs by the end of the year.  See where the John Schools are » . ""It will make them [offenders] see that this is not a victimless crime, and they are contributing to the exploitation of women,"" said Stephanie Davis, policy adviser on women's issues at the mayor's office in Atlanta. ""It's hurting them, the man, and it's hurting their families and its hurting the community."" No comprehensive effort has been made to track the numbers, but experts estimate 1 million to 2 million prostitutes work in the United States. The FBI's 2007 Uniform Crime Report lists about 78,000 arrests for prostitution and commercialized vice, but experts say those numbers are extremely conservative because many sex workers and johns aren't caught. Experts add that easy accessibility to prostitutes and pornography on the Internet are feeding the problem. In most communities, prostitution has been a one-sided battle focused on the women who offer sex. Their customers, when they are arrested, are usually cited for a misdemeanor and fined. By comparison, prostitutes are often charged with more severe sentences and jailed for months, depending on the offense. But in Nashville, the johns' faces are shown on a police Web site. For decades, Nashville battled prostitution by arresting women on the streets and through stings. Still, the problem persisted, irritating business owners and residents. In the early 1990s, Nashville's mayor helped launch the John School with the help of the Magdalene House, public defenders, prosecutors and police officers. Nashville became one of the first major cities in the U.S. to focus on the customers, predominantly men. Only first-time offenders who solicit an adult are eligible for John School. Johns who pick up minors are not eligible and face much tougher sentences. ""If you get caught again and you get me, I will guarantee to put you in jail,"" warned Antoinette Welch, a local prosecutor, in speaking to the men in the class. ""I've had men cry to me that they will lose their jobs or their wives, but you're all grown up and you make your own decisions."" The men listened carefully as Welch talked about their records; many had not yet told their wives or significant others about their arrest. If the john pleads guilty, pays a $250 fee and completes the course without re-offending, the charge can be dismissed after a year. The money paid by the john goes to Magdalene House; the program doesn't cost taxpayers any money. John School models in other communities may differ. A woman who called herself Alexis, a 35-year-old former prostitute with dark hair and bright blue eyes, spoke to the men as the class came to an end. Four years ago, she left the streets and now works at a factory. By the age of 10, Alexis had learned to barter with sex with her stepfather. In her 20s, she found herself hooked on drugs and selling her body. She was arrested more than 80 times. She was hospitalized after someone shot her on the job. As she told her story, the men were silent. A few blushed, while others stared at the floor. ""These gentlemen are no different than I was on the streets,"" she said. ""I think everyone has to look at the void they are trying to fill."" One john, a father of two with salt-and-pepper hair, found himself near tears after Alexis spoke. In July, he tried to pick up a prostitute through Craigslist. He said he was depressed and having problems with his wife. ""I'm so embarrassed,"" he said. ""These girls are somebody's daughters. I have a daughter."" Some evidence suggests that John Schools are working. A study released in 2008 by Abt Associates Inc. for the federal government looked at the John School program in San Francisco, California. It's one of the largest programs in the country; more than 7,000 johns have attended since 1995. According to the study, the re-arrest rate fell sharply after the school was launched, and stayed more than 30 percent lower for 10 years afterward. But critics call John School a slap on the wrist. On Saturday, one john abandoned the classroom. Carol Leigh, a member of the Sex Workers Outreach Project, a group that promotes decriminalizing prostitution in California, said she doesn't believe the program is an effective deterrent. ""John School doesn't do that much,"" said Leigh, who has worked as a prostitute. ""The reality is they aren't spending that much time on the johns and they will just go to other venues. This also doesn't target the violent offenders who are the real problem."" Melissa Farley, head of the nonprofit group Prostitution Research and Education in San Fransisco, believes johns deserve stronger punishment like longer prison sentences. A recent study by the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation conducted among johns in Chicago, Illinois, found that 41 percent of them said John School would deter them from buying sex, compared with 92 percent who said being placed on a sex offender registry would scare them from re-offending. Nashville officials said they haven't tracked recidivism rates in their city, but the school's program director said it's probably deterring a third of the offenders in each class. At least one college educated, 47-year-old john's attitude appeared to change on a recent Saturday. After class he wrote, ""There is no good part. I would rather be with my wife. This was quick but it wasn't worth it.""","Experts say about 1 million to 2 million prostitutes work in the United States .

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- More than 400 people have been killed in a spate of violence in northern Nigeria, the president of a human rights group said Tuesday. More than 150 alleged militants were arrested by Nigerian police after clashes. The violence has pitted Islamic militants against government police and troops in the north-central part of the nation, officials said. Attacks continued Tuesday in the suburbs of the northern city of Maiduguri, said Shehu Sani, president of the Civil Rights Congress, a human rights organization based in northern Nigeria. People there are seeking refuge in police and military barracks and in hospitals, he said. Police and troops were dispatched to the militants' hideouts after they began attacks on government establishments Sunday, said police spokesman Moses Anegbode. As authorities exchanged fire with the militants, 41 people, including a soldier and a policeman, were killed, Anegbode said Monday. In addition, some 176 people were arrested in Bauchi, he said. Besides Bauchi, militants also staged attacks on the nearby states of Yobe and Borno on Sunday and Monday, said Emmanuel Ojukwu, spokesman for the national police. Yobe's police commissioner, Alhaji Muhammed Abbas, said that 23 suspected militants were arrested in connection with a bomb attack at a police station in Potiskum that killed a policeman and a civilian and wounded seven people. The official News Agency of Nigeria reported that as many as 100 members of a religious sect led by Sheikh Mohammed Yusuf may have been killed in a confrontation with police. In Borno, police spokesman Isa Azare said that two policemen were killed in an attack on police headquarters late Monday. ""The religious fanatics took the police unawares,"" Azare told the government-affiliated New Nigerian newspaper. ""That was why they succeeded in killing all the officers on night duty."" Panicked residents stayed inside in all three states, and businesses shut down, even though officials said the situation was under control. The militants used guns, bows and arrows and machetes in the attacks, officials said. The militants disagree with the government's teaching of Islam in the region, maintaining that the government allows itself to be influenced by Western values, and have been attacking government offices and Islamic clergy. There is a history of religious violence in central Nigeria, where majority-Muslim north Africa meets largely Christian sub-Saharan Africa. Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 1,000 people were killed in riots in 2001. The human rights organization alleged last week that police and soldiers killed at least 133 people during two days of riots between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria last year. Most of the victims were young Muslim men, often unarmed, the group charged in testimony before a state commission examining the riots and in a separate report. More than 700 people died in the violence, the organization said, citing local religious authorities on both sides of the divide. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","As many as 400 people killed in Nigerian violence, group says .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Investigators think that a reality TV contestant wanted for questioning in the death of his ex-wife has gone to Canada, police in Washington state told CNN Thursday. Police want to question Ryan Jenkins about the death of his ex-wife, model Jasmine Fiore. Ryan Alexander Jenkins, who appeared on two VH1 reality TV shows, matched the description of a man seen driving a boat in Blaine Marina off the coast of northwest Washington on Wednesday, the Whatcom County Sheriff's Office said. Blaine, Washington, is very near the Canadian border. Authorities searched the area and found Jenkins' black SUV with an empty boat trailer at the Blaine Marina, police said. The nude body of Jasmine Fiore, 28, a former swimsuit model, was found Saturday stuffed into a suitcase in California. Fiore lived in Los Angeles and was last seen alive Friday in San Diego at a poker game with her ex-husband, Jenkins. Police have wanted to question Jenkins about Fiore's death. ""We believe that perhaps he might have information that would be beneficial to the investigation,"" Lt. Gary Worrall of the Buena Park Police Department said Wednesday on HLN's ""Nancy Grace."" Jenkins reported Fiore missing Saturday night to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, authorities said. Earlier that day, a body was found in a large suitcase inside a trash bin behind an apartment complex in Buena Park, just outside Anaheim in Orange County.  Watch man describe finding body » . The body was identified as Fiore on Monday. While the cause of death has not been confirmed, a preliminary coroner's report indicates she was strangled.

The U.S. Marshals Service and Canadian authorities have joined the search for Jenkins, according to the Whatcom County police. Jenkins and Fiore reportedly were married for a few weeks before getting the union annulled.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has agreed to review a civil liberties dispute over the government's power to criminalize ""support"" of a terrorist organization. The Supreme Court will review a key provision of the 2001 Patriot Act. The justices on Wednesday accepted review of a key provision of the 2001 Patriot Act, and whether it threatens free speech rights of those who would assist non-violent activities of designated groups. Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States, federal prosecutors have pursued ""material support"" cases against at least 120 individuals or organizations, winning convictions in about half of those cases. Nearly every such domestic terrorism-related prosecution has included that charge as part of the indictment. At issue is whether the congressional law allows prosecution of those with knowledge of ""any service, training, expert advice or assistance"" to a foreign terrorist organization, as designated by the U.S. government. A federal appeals court in San Francisco, California, struck down several parts of the legislation, finding them too vague to satisfy the Constitution. The government then asked the high court to intervene and uphold the law. Among those charged under the ""material support"" provision: John Walker Lindh, an American Muslim captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan; the ""Lackawanna Six,"" men from Buffalo, New York, who attended an al Qaeda training camp; several men in Portland, Oregon, who allegedly sought to travel to Afghanistan to fight on behalf of the Taliban; a group of young Virginia individuals who allegedly tried to assist a Kashmir terror group; and James Ujaama, an African-American activist in Seattle, Washington. The key plaintiff in the current appeal is the Humanitarian Law Project, a Los Angeles, California-based non-profit that says its mission is to advocate ""for the peaceful resolution of armed conflicts and for worldwide compliance with humanitarian law and human rights law."" HLP sought to help the Kurdistan Workers' Party, a group active in Turkey. Known as PKK, the party was founded in the mid-1970s and has been labeled a terror organization by the United States and the European Union. Its leaders have previously called for militancy to create a separate Kurdish state in parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran, where Kurds comprise a population majority. In its appeal to the high court, the government noted that ""since its inception, the organization has waged a violent insurgency that has claimed over 22,000 lives."" HLP claimed it wanted to advocate on behalf of the PKK before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and conduct other advisory sessions and public awareness campaigns. Another plaintiff is an American physician who wanted to help ethnic Tamils in his native Sri Lanka. Much of the island nation is controlled by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has also fought for decades to carve an independent state. The government claims the Tamil Tigers have ""used suicide bombings and political assassinations in its campaign for independence, killing hundreds of civilians in the process."" HLP and a group of Tamil doctors say they merely wanted ""to provide their expert medical advice on how to address the shortage of medical facilities and trained physicians"" in the region but ""they are afraid to do so because they fear prosecution for providing material support."" The Patriot Act was passed six weeks after the 9/11 terrorism attacks. It included amending a previous anti-terror law to strengthen the ""expert advice and assistance"" provision, making it a crime punishable by a 10- to 15-year prison sentence. The Justice Department calls the material support provision ""a vital part of the nation's effort to fight international terrorism.""

"Editor's note: Harry Shearer is an actor, author, director, satirist, musician, radio host, playwright, fine artist and record label owner who is the voice of a variety of regular characters on ""The Simpsons,"" most notably Mr. Burns, Smithers and insufferable neighbor Ned Flanders. Harry Shearer says the White House isn't getting actively involved in protecting New Orleans from flooding. (CNN) -- I spent much of this month in my adopted hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. Uncharacteristically for August, the streets and restaurants and galleries and music clubs were largely full and throbbing with energy. There are hubs of entrepreneurs all over town trying to invent the future. And thankfully, Mayor Ray Nagin's term is only months away from its end. Between my weeks in the Crescent City, I joined some local folks in traipsing up to the Aspen Institute to share the news of New Orleans with interested outsiders. One talked about the progress in rebuilding homes. Another discussed the reform of the public-school system, the decoupling of the schools from a centralized board, resulting in the city becoming the leader in charter-school enrollment. A third talked about the move to neighborhood medical clinics, an effort to replace the hospital beds missing in the flooding's wake. A fourth reported the good economic statistics, marred only by the continuing shortage in affordable rental housing (80,000 units were whacked by the flood). And a fifth discussed the citizen activism that is helping, along with a determined U.S. attorney (who's just sent Rep. William Jefferson and his brother Mose to jail), to clean up local politics. After all, it was New Jersey pols, not New Orleans ones, who got snagged in a scheme involving black-market kidneys. Wish we'd thought of that. All good news. And all transpiring under a shadow, one made all too evident early last week when the city experienced a collective shudder as the spinning cyclonic shape of Hurricane Bill appeared on TV screens. New Orleans, hit so hard by what so many (including President Obama in his Sunday interview with the local newspaper) still see fit to describe, mistakenly, as a natural disaster, is making remarkable progress, while the agency that so disastrously failed at building a protective system mandated by Congress -- the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -- may be making some of the same mistakes in rebuilding that system. And the White House, for the second consecutive administration, seems not to care. Me? I'm a humorist, a comic actor, a sometime musician-filmmaker-novelist-blogger. What the hell do I know about what happened to the city I love? Since the levees collapsed, I've been reading the local newspaper, the Times-Picayune, watching and listening to the local media, which, post-disaster, have rediscovered their mission to make local news more than a recitation of the previous day's murders, car crashes and celebrity misbehaviors. While the national media packed up and moved away after the initial orgasm of anger at FEMA, the local media reported something remarkable: The Corps was claiming that the flooding was due to the ""overtopping"" of its levees and floodwalls, while two teams of pro-bono forensic investigators were finding evidence that no overtopping had occurred. As the Corps started denigrating these investigators, they kept digging, and kept coming up with the real story, available now for all to see (though all too few have) as the ILIT report from the University of California at Berkeley and the Team Louisiana report from Louisiana State University. Their conclusions: The ""hurricane protection system"" built by the Corps had serious design and construction flaws, baked into the system over 40 years under administrations of both parties, that caused catastrophic failure in more than 50 locations under storm surge conditions markedly less than the system was advertised to withstand. You and I, federal taxpayers, had paid to flood New Orleans. Since the Obama administration took office, the Corps has: announced that one part of the new ""system"" will be built using a ""technically not superior"" solution, because of funding problems; and, defying a Congressional mandate, delivered a report supposed to offer a post-2011 plan for so-called Category 5 storm protection 20 months late and lacking a specific plan, offering only a menu of possible options. It's almost as if the Corps is inviting someone else to do the job. Someone else can. A New Orleans architect, David Waggonner, has been convening a group of local architects and planners and engineers and their Dutch colleagues to mine the eight centuries of collective wisdom of the Netherlands about the challenge of living with water. The resulting plans, published as the ""Dutch dialogues,"" make for inspiring and depressing reading; inspiring because they offer a vision of a city that has stopped fighting a war against water and has learned to use water both to enhance value and to enhance safety, depressing because there is so clearly no federal impetus, from the president on down, to embrace such a new approach. President Obama, who has mainly limited his comments about New Orleans to feel-good boilerplate, did pledge to make good on President Bush's promise on that eerie, floodlit night in a deserted Jackson Square in 2005, to rebuild New Orleans better and stronger. But he has yet to actively intervene to make sure New Orleans gets state-of-the-art flood protection and robust and timely coastal wetland reconstruction. Like President Bush, President Obama so far seems to be acting as if just saying it makes it so. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harry Shearer.","Harry Shearer: There is much good news in New Orleans, but still problems .

"(CNN)  -- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher could be set to make a shock return to Formula One as Ferrari look for a short-term replacement for the injured Felipe Massa. Michael Schumacher remains very much part of the Ferrari set-up as an advisor for the Formula One team. The 28-year-old Brazilian is currently in intensive care at the AEK military hospital in Budapest after suffering a fractured skull in a freak accident in qualifying for Saturday's Hungarian Grand Prix. Massa's condition has improved in the past 24 hours with doctors taking him out of a medically-induced coma on Monday night. He has since responded well to questions and Peter Bazso, the medical director of the hospital, claimed on Tuesday morning that Massa might be able to walk out of the hospital in 10 days' time. Felipe Massa's crash in pictures. » . ""My expectation is that he would walk out of the hospital on his own. If his recovery continues, I wouldn't rule out that he could leave within 10 days,"" Bazso told Hungarian TV channel M1. ""He's spending more and more time awake, talking to family and friends. I would like to point out that, although he is recovering, this is not the end of the story, he is still in a life-threatening condition. Of course, the danger is decreasing by the day."" While the news regarding Massa's condition continues to be encouraging, behind the scenes Ferrari are faced with the task of finding a replacement driver. Doctors have said Massa will be out for at least six weeks, although there are still fears he may never return as a result of his injuries. He will certainly miss the European and Belgian Grands Prix at the end of August, although the current four-week break before the next race in Valencia gives the Italian team time to assess their options. On the list of likely replacements could be Schumacher -- who won five of his drivers' titles with Ferrari and works as an advisor for the team. The 40-year-old German's representative Sabine Kehm told CNN: ""There is no offer from Ferrari, but if they decided they need him, Michael would certainly weigh his options."" Ferrari spokesman Luca Colajanni later confirmed to the Press Association that Schumacher, who retired in 2006, was an option. ""We have said before that it is possible that Michael Schumacher could return to help us out,"" said Colajanni. ""However, we have two test drivers at Ferrari (Luca Badoer and Marc Gene) at the moment and Michael is an advisor. Does safety need to be improved in Formula One? ""We have not spoken to him and we will have to wait and see what happens. It is something for (Ferrari team principal) Stefano Domenicali to consider over the coming weeks. ""We need to see how Felipe is and the situation will evolve from there. We are not in any hurry, the first and foremost thing is Felipe's recovery."" Colajanni also provided further encouraging news regarding Massa, although he played down Bazso's assertion that he could walk out of hospital as early as next week. ""I think that on Monday he improved a lot but we have to remain cautious,"" he said. ""It is not useful to put forecasts on these things. I think for the moment we should just enjoy the positive improvements that Felipe is making."" Massa was hurt when a spring that had fallen from the back of Rubens Barrichello's Brawn GP car struck him on the helmet at high-speed, causing him to lose control of his car and crash into a tire barrier. On Monday, Professor Robert Veres, the surgeon who operated on Massa over the weekend, told reporters that Massa had suffered some damage to his left eye, which could threaten his future in the sport. ""It's too early to say about his future as we don't know the extent of the damage. Without an operation it's very hard to evaluate the eye's function,"" said Vares. Massa's crash came less than a week after Formula Two driver Henry Surtees, the son of former world champion John Surtees, was killed in similar circumstances, knocked unconscious by a tire which flew off another car in a race at Brands Hatch in England, before crashing. Formula One's safety record has improved dramatically in recent years, with the last fatality in 1994 when the legendary Brazilian Ayrton Senna crashed at Imola.","Michael Schumacher could be set to make a surprise return to Formula One .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Prosecutors will seek the death penalty against three men accused in connection with the July death of former boxing champion Vernon Forrest, officials said Tuesday. Former boxing champion Vernon Forrest, 38, was shot and killed in southwest Atlanta, Georgia, on July 25. A grand jury indicted the three suspects -- Charman Sinkfield, 30; Demario Ware, 20; and Jquante Crews, 25 -- on charges including murder, felony murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, Fulton County Superior Court spokesman Don Plummer said in a statement. Forrest, 38, was shot and killed in southwest Atlanta on July 25. He had stopped at a gas station to put air in his tire, Plummer said, and was robbed at gunpoint of his championship ring and Rolex watch. ""Forrest chased the robber, believed to be Demario Ware, and then lost sight of him as he escaped into a nearby public housing complex,"" Plummer said. ""Forrest then encountered the accused triggerman, Charman Sinkfield, not far from the scene of the armed robbery. As he turned to walk away from the man, Forrest was shot seven times."" Crews is accused of being the getaway driver, Plummer said. Forrest was the International Boxing Federation welterweight champion in 2001, the World Boxing Council welterweight champion in 2002-03, and the WBC light welterweight champion in 2007-08 and 2008-09, according to the BoxRec Web site. He was named the World Boxing Hall of Fame fighter of the year in 2002, the Web site said. A $17,000 reward has been offered for the return of the watch and ring, Plummer said. The watch has a black leather band and diamonds, and his championship ring is engraved with his name and four X's signifying his four championship wins.","Three men accused in July death of former boxing champion Vernon Forrest .

"(CNN) -- A Florida man in custody in Haiti faces first-degree murder charges in the deaths of his wife and five children, authorities said Tuesday. Police have obtained a warrant to arrest Mesac Damas, 33, on suspicion of six counts of first-degree murder. Police obtained a warrant overnight to arrest Mesac Damas, 33, on suspicion of six counts of first-degree murder, the Collier County, Florida, Sheriff's Office said in a statement. ""This warrant was obtained based on information and evidence collected thus far in the investigation and statements made by Damas to a federal agent after his detention in Haiti,"" the statement said. The body of Damas' wife, Guerline Damas, 32, was found Saturday in the family's North Naples, Florida, home, along with those of the couple's five children -- Michzach, 9; Marven, 6; Maven, 5; Megan, 3; and Morgan, 11 months, police said. Authorities have not said how the five were killed, but Collier County Sheriff Kevin Rambosk described the scene as ""horrific."" Police released few new details in the case at a Tuesday news conference, except to say they think the killings were premeditated. They added that under the law, ""premeditated"" does not necessarily mean a crime was planned far in advance. Damas was last seen about 9 p.m. Thursday at the Naples restaurant where he was employed as a cook, authorities said. On Friday, he is thought to have arrived at Miami International Airport about 7 a.m. He boarded a flight for Haiti about 10 a.m., Rambosk said. His car was found at the airport. He purchased a one-way ticket to Haiti, police said Tuesday. Police had asked the FBI and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for help in finding Damas. The FBI's legal attaché in the Dominican Republic notified Collier County authorities that a man believed to be Damas was taken into custody Monday by the Haitian National Police. ""Information obtained by CCSO shows Damas was found hiding near a hotel in the capital city of Port-au-Prince,"" a sheriff's statement said Tuesday. The judge who signed the warrant ordered that Damas be held without bond upon his return to Collier County, authorities said. If convicted of six counts of first-degree murder, Damas could face life in prison or the death penalty. Collier County investigators are traveling to Port-au-Prince on Tuesday to interview Damas, the statement said. Rambosk said authorities are looking into two options to return Damas to Florida: following the normal extradition process, or having him deported from Haiti, since he is a U.S. citizen. Mesac and Guerline Damas had a history of domestic violence, police said. Mesac Damas was arrested in January, and pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery charges against his wife in June. Police said they did not believe he served any jail time, and did not think a restraining order was currently in place regarding the couple. However, an arrest warrant was issued Monday for Damas on charges of violating probation stemming from the January arrest. The Damases had been married about 10 years, Rambosk said. He did not know how long they had lived in Naples. The six bodies were found about 6:30 p.m. Saturday, a day after police had visited the home to check on the family, Collier County sheriff's Capt. Chris Roberts said. A family member asked police to conduct a welfare check on the home Friday, saying a resident there had not been heard from, Roberts said. Responding officers knocked on the door and got no answer, he said, but they saw nothing that aroused their suspicions. The following morning, the family member became more concerned and filed a missing persons report, Rambosk said. Later, authorities requested a key to the house from property management, as well as authorization to enter. Rambosk said Tuesday the victims' family members are ""extremely emotional and distraught.""","NEW: At a news conference, police say they think killings were premeditated .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Central Intelligence Agency hired the private security firm Blackwater USA in 2004 to work on a covert program aimed at targeting and potentially killing top al Qaeda leaders, according to a source familiar with the program. CIA Director Leon Panetta canceled the covert program this year when he learned of its full scope. The existence of the program, which began in 2001, came to light earlier this year when CIA Director Leon Panetta canceled the effort, but it is only now that Blackwater's involvement has become known. That development was first reported Thursday in The New York Times. The program was part of a broader effort inside the CIA to develop the capacity to conduct training, surveillance and possible covert operations overseas, according to the source. The program was outsourced to contractors to ""put some distance"" between the effort and the U.S. government. By mid-2006, Blackwater's involvement in the program had ended, according to a U.S. official. Other contractors were brought in for other parts of the program, another source said. The total program cost ""millions,"" a U.S. official said. It is not known how much Blackwater was paid. The company -- now known as Xe -- did not return CNN's calls seeking comment. ""The program ebbed and flowed. There were different phases to it. There may have been different folks involved,"" the source said. U.S. officials have previously acknowledged that Panetta canceled the entire program this year when he learned of its full scope. At the time of the cancellation, officials said, renewal of the program was being considered. At that point, it had been brought to the new CIA director's attention. Panetta canceled the effort in part because Congress had not been notified about it, officials said. Also, some in the intelligence community were worried there could be a diplomatic disaster if contractors were caught performing such work in foreign countries. Former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who ran the agency from 2006 to 2009, downplayed the program during a speaking engagement in Washington. ""This was not a very prominent thing during my time as director,"" Hayden said. ""What you had were three separate efforts under three different directors to deal with an issue that everyone understood was a problem in a capacity that everyone agreed we should have."" A spokesman for the CIA would not comment on the details of the still-classified program. ""Director Panetta thought this effort should be briefed to Congress, and he did so,"" spokesman George Little said. ""He also knew it hadn't been successful, so he ended it. Neither decision was difficult. This was clear and straightforward. ""Director Panetta did not tell the committees that the agency had misled the Congress or had broken the law. He decided that the time had come to brief Congress on a counterterrorism effort."" Blackwater's extensive involvement in U.S. operations overseas, particularly in Iraq, has been controversial. The Iraqi government says that in a shooting in September 2007, Blackwater security guards killed 17 Iraqi civilians. Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents, but an Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation. The incident led to the Iraqi government's refusal to renew the firm's operating license in the country when it expired in May. Although it lost the Iraq contract, the company, which changed its name to Xe earlier this year, continued to get multimillion-dollar contracts from the U.S. government for work in Afghanistan.","Program, begun in 2001, came to light this year, when it was canceled .

"(CNN) -- At least 12 airplanes shared the trans-Atlantic sky with doomed Air France Flight 447, but none reported any problems, deepening the mystery surrounding the cause of the plane's disappearance. Image released by the Brazilian Air Force shows oil slicks in the water near a debris site. Airlines confirmed that at least a dozen aircraft departed roughly at the same time and traversed approximately the same route, but did not report problematic weather conditions. This has led some aviation experts to suggest that technical problems on the airplane might be the main cause of the crash, though they may have combined with weather conditions to create serious problems. The new information raises more questions than answers about Air France 447, believed to have plunged into the Atlantic Ocean somewhere between the coasts of Brazil and West Africa on May 31, presumably killing all 228 aboard. The plane's computer system reported a series of technical problems about four hours after takeoff and immediately after entering a large storm system a few hundred miles from the far eastern coast of Brazil. Severe winds, updrafts and even lightning have been mentioned as possible causes of the crash, potentially triggering a failure of the plane's technical systems. But aviation experts cautioned that weather alone would not normally cause a crash. Planes routinely fly through large storms, using the sensitive radar on board to navigate through specific storm cells. When conditions are severe enough, planes can easily deviate around or above storms, experts say. In addition to Flight 447, Air France had four other Paris-bound flights that left in the same broad time frame from that part of the world, according to an airline spokesman. One flight left Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, at 4:20 p.m. At that same moment, another Air France flight left nearby Sao Paulo. A third Air France flight left Buenos Aires, Argentina, at 5:50 p.m., also heading for Paris. A final Air France flight left Sao Paulo at 7:10 p.m., almost exactly when the doomed flight took off from Rio. All of these flights took a similar route toward Paris, heading first toward Recife on the east coast of Brazil and then continuing northeast over the Atlantic. None of the other flights experienced anything unusual, the spokesman said. All arrived in Paris the next day, with no significant delays of any kind. That same evening two Air Iberia flights bound for Madrid, Spain, left Brazil at about the same time as Flight 447; one departed from Rio de Janeiro and another from Sao Paulo, according to officials at Iberia. Those flights also reported no problems. It was the same story for one British Airways flight and three Air TAM Brazil flights, all of which flew routes similar to the missing plane. Although none of the other flights are known to have reported weather problems en route, aviation experts said weather can change suddenly and vary over short distances, so one plane might experience conditions far worse than another.","At least 12 flights traveled from Brazil to Europe around same time as 447 .

"(CNN) -- The separatist group behind a series of bombings on a Spanish vacation island marks the 50 year anniversary of its struggle this year, a milestone that sees it no closer to achieving its goal. Police cordon off the route leading to the location of the latest blasts in Palma de Mallorca. ETA, which is fighting for the independence of Spain's northern Basque region, was said to be behind three bombs that detonated on the island of Mallorca on Sunday without hurting anyone. The latest incident appears to be part of a new wave of attacks, including another in Mallorca which killed two Civil Guard officers in July, which have left a 2006 cease-fire a distant memory. The violent resurgence also defies Spanish government claims that the group's operational capabilities have been broken by a series of high profile arrests in Spain and France. ETA, blamed for more than 800 deaths and listed as a terrorist group by Spain the European Union and the United States, began campaigning for Basque independence in 1959. The group, whose full name Euskadi Ta Askatasuna means ""Basque Homeland and Freedom"" in the Basque language, killed what some say was its first victim in 1968. Since then it waged a campaign of violence against the Spanish state, targeting politicians, policemen, judges and soldiers, often clocking up numerous civilian casualties with deadly car bombs. In 1980 alone ETA was blamed for 118 deaths, and in 1995 it nearly succeeded in assassinating Jose Maria Aznar, then leader of the opposition and later Spain's prime minister. On September 16, 1998, the organization declared a ""unilateral and indefinite"" cease-fire, raising hopes that its campaign was at an end. ETA called off the cease-fire in November 1999, however, and 2000 saw a sharp escalation in violence. Another unilateral cease-fire was declared in March 2005, with ETA raising hopes for a lasting peace by declaring it ""permanent."" It was called off by ETA in June 2006 following numerous more ETA attacks. At the center of the struggle is a region know as Euskal Herria in Basque. The area straddles the western end of the Pyrenees, covering 20,664 square kilometers in northern Spain and southern France. See map of territory claimed by Basque separatists . Spain officially recognizes three Basque provinces, Alava, Guipuzcoa and Vizcaya. A fourth neighboring province, Navarra, is of Basque heritage. Separatists consider these four provinces plus three in France -- Basse Navarre, Labourd and Soule -- as the Basque country, with a population approaching 3 million. The area has always possessed a fiercely independent instinct. The Basque people are the oldest indigenous ethnic group in Europe and have lived uninterrupted in the same region since the beginning of recorded history. Their language, Euskera, which is spoken regularly by about 40 percent of Basque inhabitants, bears no relation to any other Indo-European tongue and dates back to before the Romans arrived in Spain. For many centuries the Basques of Spain enjoyed a strong degree of autonomy. The Basque region's hilly landscape helped keep its people isolated from outside influences. In the Spanish Civil War, two Basque provinces -- Guipuzcoa and Viscaya -- fought against Gen. Francisco Franco, while the provinces of Alava and Navarra fought for Franco. Under Franco's dictatorship (1939-75), most of the Basque region had its remaining autonomy rescinded. Its culture, people and language were suppressed. ETA and its demands for an independent Basque state arose in 1959 in the midst of this suppression. ETA has focused its activities on the Spanish side of the border. For many years France provided a safe haven for ETA members, a situation that began to change in the mid-1980s. The organization has financed its campaign through kidnapping, bank robbery and a so-called ""revolutionary tax"" on Basque businesses -- a payment widely regarded as plain extortion. According to the counter-terrorism office of the U.S. State Department, ETA members received training in Libya, Lebanon and Nicaragua, while the group also enjoyed close links with the Irish Republican Army. The Good Friday peace accord influenced ETA to call its cease-fire in 1998.","Basque separatist group ETA formed in 1959 began violent campaign in 1968 .

"(CNN) -- U.S. troops have launched a ""major operation"" against Taliban fighters in southern Afghanistan, U.S. military officials announced in Afghanistan early Thursday. U.S. Marines gather for a briefing in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, on Wednesday. About 4,000 Americans, mostly from the Marines, and 650 Afghan soldiers and police launched Operation Khanjar -- ""strike of the sword"" -- in the Helmand River valley, the U.S. command in Kabul announced. The push is the largest since the Pentagon began moving additional troops into the conflict this year, and it follows a British-led operation launched last week in the same region, the Marines said. It is also the first big move since U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal took over as the allied commander in Afghanistan in mid-June. In Washington, a senior defense official said the size and scope of the new operation are ""very significant."" ""It's not common for forces to operate at the brigade level,"" the official said. ""In fact, they often only conduct missions at the platoon level. And they're going into the most troubled area of Afghanistan."" Helmand Province, where much of the fighting is taking place, has been a hotbed of Taliban violence in recent months. At least 25 U.S. and British troops have been killed there in 2009. The defense official said the operation is a ""tangible indication"" of the new approach that McChrystal -- a former chief of the Pentagon's special operations command -- is bringing to the nearly eight-year war. ""They're not just doing an offensive push to get bad guys; they're going in to hold the area and stay there,"" the official said. ""This approach is indicative of McChrystal's philosophy: measuring success by the number of Afghans protected, not bad guys killed."" The Obama administration has moved about 21,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan, the original front in the war launched after the September 11 attacks. During his confirmation hearing in June, McChrystal told senators that the conflict requires a new focus on counterinsurgency to reduce violence and build support for the U.S.-led NATO alliance among Afghans. ""Although I expect stiff fighting ahead, the measure of success will not be enemy killed. It will be shielding the Afghan population from violence,"" he said. The Islamic fundamentalist Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan before its allies in the al Qaeda terrorist network attacked New York and Washington in 2001. Though quickly toppled after the attacks, its leaders escaped, and the movement regrouped in the Afghan countryside and across the border in Pakistan. CNN Pentagon Correspondent Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.","4,000 American troops, 650 Afghans involved in Operation Khanjar .

"(CNN) -- The Pentagon has revolutionized warfare during the past decade, making unmanned aerial vehicles, known as UAVs, a staple of modern combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. A USAF technician at Creech Air Force Base, checks Hellfire missile attachments on a Predator. Remotely-controlled drones, such as the Predator and the Reaper, have allowed the U.S. military to spy on and attack enemy combatants without putting their own forces at risk, thereby making UAVs a must-have. ""The real advantage of unmanned aerial systems is they allow you to project power without projecting vulnerability,"" says USAF Lt. Gen. David Deptula at the Pentagon.   But as USAF commanders try to provide enough pilots to take charge of drones, many are considering another aspect of the warfare revolution -- the psychological impact on those controlling the vehicles. As Dr. Kory Cornum, a USAF colonel, explains: ""Whereas we have thousands of years of data on what it's like to go to war really, we only have a few years of data on what it's like to go to war virtually. And so we don't have really enough data."" Pilots are now dealing with something never experienced before -- a rapid transition from intense combat to home comfort, often in less than an hour. Some describe it as a version of post-traumatic stress disorder, often more associated with soldiers directly in harm's way. Peter Singer, an adviser to U.S. President Barack Obama's campaign team and author of ""Wired for War,"" described one encounter with a frustrated non-commissioned officer. ""She actually banged the table, saying: 'No one is paying attention to this issue of PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] among my men and women, no one's paying attention to it,"" Singer says. ""And she talked about a scene where they were flying a drone above a set of U.S. soldiers that were killed and the drone was unarmed at the time and they couldn't do anything about it. They just circled above and they watched U.S. soldiers die in front of them.""  Watch the debate about the impact of UAVs on pilots » . USAF fighter pilots like Major Morgan Andrews remotely control drones from Creech Air Force Base in Nevada. Less than an hour after targeting he'll be back in suburban Las Vegas, his drive home more physically dangerous than the combat mission he has just undertaken. Commanders at Creech say that if there is stress, it comes from relentless around-the-clock shift work. Andrews says that like any good pilot he has learned to compartmentalize his life, using his commute to and from work to transition. ""I think about work, I think about what happened,"" Andrews explains, ""what I could've done better, anything I maybe did wrong that I could've done differently, how could I do it better next time. I just kind of go through it and usually, by the time I get home, I've sorted it all through my mind and stick it away in a file and go on with life."" For Andrews, fighting from Nevada more than outweighs the drawbacks of long overseas deployments, allowing him to enjoy life at home with his family and friends. Cornum adds that the drive home is more of a blessing than anyone realized. ""It does give you some amount of time, as opposed to if you lived on base and you could literally walk out of war and into your house,"" he says. ""I don't know if 30 minutes is enough. But it gives you time to decompress."" But conducting remote warfare, as Cornum explains, brings with it stress that vary from those usually experienced by troops. ""The big difference is that when you are actually deployed, you are with all your battle buddies who are experiencing the thing 24/7. Whereas when you go home, you go home to your family, to your neighbors, who are not in the battle all the time. And that's good and bad.""","Robotic warfare allows pilots to control armed vehicles without risk to themselves .

"(CNN) -- Man-made climate change threatens to stress water resources, challenge crops and livestock, raise sea levels and adversely affect human health, according to a report released by the Obama administration on Tuesday. Farmers and workers in central California are suffering through the third year of a worsening drought. The nearly 200-page document on global climate change -- released by the White House science adviser and mandated by Congress -- does not include new research, but encompasses several recent studies on the effects of global warming over the last half century. Among the report's key findings are an ""unequivocal and primarily human-induced"" rise in the Earth's temperature of 2 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 50 years, and a projection of more rapidly changing temperatures over the next several decades. ""It's not just a problem for the future,"" said Jane Lubchenco, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""We're beginning to see the impact on our daily lives."" The continuing temperature rise is likely to spur a series of negative consequences for the Earth's energy supply, water, transportation, ecosystems and health, the study said. ""[The report] tells us why remedial action is needed sooner rather than later, as well as showing why that action must include both global emissions reductions to reduce the extent of climate change and local adaptation measures to reduce the damage from the changes that are no longer avoidable,"" said John P. Holdren, the White House science adviser. Among the study's specific predictions: Longer and more intense heat waves; increased heavy downpours likely to cause widespread complications such as flooding and waterborne diseases; reduced summer runoff, creating greater competition for water, especially in the West; rising ocean water temperatures that will threaten coral reefs; an increase in wildfires and insect infestations; and more frequent coastal flooding caused by rising seas. The report is the first in almost a decade to break down impacts of climate change on regions and economic sectors of the United States. For example, warming trends in coming decades are expected to reduce the lobster catch in the waters of the Northeast, increase the intensity of hurricanes in the Southeast and accelerate drought in the Southwest, it said. Authors of the comprehensive report said they hope it can serve as a valuable tool for policymakers and other Americans, such as farmers making crop decisions or local governments passing zoning restrictions in coastal areas. The report comes as Congress debates a White House-backed climate change bill that seeks to reduce the United State's greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 through a so-called ""cap and trade"" program. The bill cleared a key House committee vote in May and could be considered by the entire chamber within the next two weeks, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday. The bill's future remains unclear in the Senate, where leaders are holding off advancing their own version of the legislation until it clears the lower chamber.","Man-made climate change is adversely affecting the U.S., says a federal report .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A woman asked Rep. Allen Boyd at a town hall meeting the other day if health care reform proposals would force people to let the government access their bank accounts. False rumors about health care have been aired at town hall meetings, like this one in Maryland last week. ""That's not true,"" the Florida Democrat responded. ""When someone sends you something on the Internet that sounds crazy, how about just checking it a little bit?"" The CNN Truth Squad, which fact-checks political claims, has debunked the bank-access rumor as false. Yet that claim, and others that have been disproved, keep coming up in the national debate on health care reform, inflaming an already emotional issue. Heated protests have disrupted town hall meetings nationwide, with people shouting at legislators and venting anger at President Obama. While the anger is genuine, some of it is based on misunderstandings of the actual proposals, said Kenneth Thorpe, a health policy expert at Emory University. ""People are freaked out because there's a lot of bad information and misinformation being ... put out there by opponents of health care reform,"" Thorpe told CNN. Obama and the Democrats say misleading information sows fear and anger, particularly among senior citizens who are worried about how changes in health care could affect Medicare. The White House and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have set up Web campaigns to refute what they describe as provably false information. ""It is now evident that an ugly campaign is under way not merely to misrepresent the health insurance reform legislation, but to disrupt public meetings and prevent members of Congress and constituents from conducting a civil dialogue,"" Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer wrote in a recent commentary. Republican opponents respond that the emotional reaction is due to Democratic efforts to rush through legislation that amounts to a government takeover of the health care system. They say the proposals eventually will lead to a system that rations treatment based on an individual's ability to contribute to society. ""We've actually started a national debate about exactly what is at stake here,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said Wednesday. Speaking on MSNBC, Steele said the town hall meetings across the country are reflecting that debate. However, when asked directly about one of the most controversial statements by some Republicans -- that a House bill would create ""death panels"" to decide who gets treatment -- Steele refused to acknowledge that such language was misinformation. The CNN Truth Squad determined the ""death panel"" claim was false, along with others spread by conservative commentators and activist groups who say Democratic proposals would promote euthanizing elderly Americans and mandate free health insurance for illegal immigrants. One of the most disputed provisions, contained in a House health care proposal, would pay doctors for consultations with patients on end-of-life issues, such as living wills. The proposal is similar to one originally written by Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia. Opponents have implied or said outright that consultations would be required -- even though the proposal says they would be voluntary. Some Republicans and Democrats have rejected the ""death panel"" language, but the issue keeps coming up. At a town hall meeting Tuesday night in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, powerful House Democrat Rep. Barney Frank called the notion that health care legislation required killing elderly people ""the single stupidest thing I've heard."" Obama says the misinformation confuses people over an already complex issue that requires public understanding. ""The notion that somehow I ran for public office or members of Congress are in this so that they can go around pulling the plug on grandma ... when you start making arguments like that, it's simply dishonest,"" the president recently said. Wendell Potter, a former insurance company communications executive, told CNN that the insurance industry deliberately spreads false information with the goal of disrupting the debate. The insurance industry hires public relations firms that create front groups to try to ""destroy health care reform by using terms like 'government takeover of the health care system' or we are heading down a 'slippery slope toward socialism' or 'we're going to kill your grandpa' because of these health care regulations,"" said Potter, now a senior fellow at the Center for Media and Democracy, which calls itself a nonpartisan watchdog group on public relations spin. Asked to respond to Potter's accusation, the director of strategic communications at America's Health Insurance Plans, Robert Zirkelbach, acknowledged in an e-mail Wednesday that the group opposes some aspects of Democratic health care proposals. ""We have been very clear and up front since day one about our opposition to a government-run insurance plan that would dismantle employer coverage, bankrupt hospitals, and increase the federal deficit,"" Zirkelbach's e-mail said. He denied that employees of his group, which is the national association of health insurers, were ""responsible for disruptive and inappropriate tactics at health care town hall meetings."" However, some of the language cited by Potter is used by politicians, including Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who told the NBC program ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that ""the Democrats want a government plan, where the government will take over health care."" Democratic proposals call for creating a government-funded health insurance plan for people who otherwise lack coverage. That is the so-called public option, which they say would compete with private insurers. Hatch and other Republicans argue the public option would create a subsidized competitor that would drive private insurers out of business, leading to the government taking over the health care system. Though Democrats deny that Republican assertion, it touches on broader fears among conservatives. Many conservatives consider the proposed health care overhaul an irresponsible and dangerous expansion of the federal government. They liken it to socialist-style control over private issues, at a cost of nearly $1 trillion over 10 years. At the same time, Americans facing an economic recession and costly government responses -- such as the $787 billion economic stimulus package and billions more paid to bail out the financial services and auto industries -- are fearful of further change and additional federal debt. Such concerns come up repeatedly at the town hall meetings held by Democrats and Republicans. The deficit recently topped $1 trillion for the first time; Obama has said he hopes to cut it in half by the end of his first term. ""When the economy is hurting, people are more inclined, I think, to be skeptical, nervous,"" Frank said. The misinformation, while refuted, has brought changes in the debate. Conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh exulted Monday when Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said that Senate negotiators dropped the end-of-life consultation provision from their proposal because Grassley said he worried it ""could be misinterpreted and implemented incorrectly."" Limbaugh said on his radio show that no matter what the health care proposals say, they will result in less money available for health care. ""It will forever transform the relationship between Americans,"" he said. ""We will instantly become rivals. We're going to become competitors vying against each other for precious health care dollars."" Grassley, who is one of three Republicans negotiating a possible bipartisan health care agreement, has used controversial language himself. He told a town hall meeting last week he couldn't support a provision that would ""pull the plug on grandma."" Former Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle called such comments part of the problem. ""It's hyperbolic, it's fear-mongering, it's actually politics at its worst,"" Daschle said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""That's the kind of thing that generates the kind of anger and fear and anxiety that people have today.""","Claims that have been debunked continue to pop up in town hall meetings, protests .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI preached and greeted well-wishers Sunday, three days after breaking his wrist in a fall. The pope celebrates mass with his broken wrist in plaster. He held the text of his speech in his uninjured left hand, then circulated among the crowd who came to hear him in Romano Canavese, pictures from the northern Italian town showed. The 82-year-old pope had surgery on his right wrist after he fell Thursday night, spokesman Father Federico Lombardi told CNN on Friday. The pope is ""learning"" to live with his cast, Lombardi told Vatican Radio. The most painful aspect of the incident for Benedict is having to give up writing by hand, which he had intended to do frequently during his annual vacation Italy's Val d'Aosta region, Lombardi told the official Vatican station. ""I know that here, too, in the Ivera region, many families are facing economic hard times due to a lack of work,"" he said, referring to the now-defunct Olivetti typewriter manufacturer in the region. ""Dear friend, do not be discouraged,"" he added, according to Agence-France Presse.

"(CNN) -- Many Google users probably didn't notice this month that they can now display their search tips in the Hawaiian language. Hawaiian is one of more than 125 ""interface languages"" now available on Google. Wedged between Hausa and Hebrew, Hawaiian is one of more than 125 ""interface languages"" now available on Google. The list also includes some humorous twists on English, including ""pirate,"" ""Klingon"" and ""Elmer Fudd."" But for Hawaiian educators, the addition of Hawaiian is a small step toward legitimizing a language that is considered ""critically endangered"" by the United Nations. ""It's the capstone of a lot of work,"" said Keola Donaghy, an assistant professor of Hawaiian studies at the University of Hawaii-Hilo. ""We've been doing this work for 18 years, simply trying to make it easier for people who speak Hawaiian to use these kinds of technologies."" It marks the first native American language available through the ""Google in Your Language"" program. Getting started . It took Donaghy several years to get the project off the ground through the ""Google in Your Language"" program, which was launched by the California-based company not long after it was founded in 1998. ""The idea was to enable users worldwide to be able to access Google in the language of their choice, and if it wasn't available, to enable users to help make it so,"" Google spokesman Nate Tyler said. ""Why limit users to a set of dominant languages if they were willing to help make Google their own?"" The results of the search are still in English, although the user can select a preference for Web pages written in more than 40 other main languages. Google works with linguists like Donaghy who are interested in translating search instructions into their language. ""Volunteers sign up on their own to provide translation,"" Tyler explained. ""They simply sign themselves up, declare a language proficiency, and then start translating or reviewing the products that are available for volunteer translation. ""When the translations are completed, we make the product(s) available in that language. Recent other languages like this include Maori language."" It was the Maori project, launched last year, that actually helped get Donaghy's initiative off the ground. Three years ago, Donaghy started e-mailing and calling Google about a Hawaiian language project, but he got no response. He put the project on hold until last year. ""When I heard the Maori version came out, I asked Google about it,"" Donaghy said. ""Apparently the original (language) coordinator had gone and as soon as a new coordinator was brought online, they set up the system."" Donaghy began working on the massive translation project sometime late last year. ""It was whenever I could find an hour or two in between teaching or other duties,"" he said. ""It was a combination of personal and work time."" He spent more than 100 hours translating the search terms that appear on the Google page into Hawaiian through the program. ""I did the actual translation from beginning to end, and then I consulted with my colleagues at the university who have worked on these projects in the past,"" Donaghy said. ""I wanted to be very consistent -- such as how you say 'Go to this menu and select this' -- or people may become confused."" What's Hawaiian for 'browsing' the Web'? Some of the Hawaiian words for terms such as ""links"" or ""Web browser"" had already been established when Donaghy and others worked on translating the Netscape Navigator search engine in 1997. ""Over the years, we usually face the debate of do we want to 'Hawaiianize' an English word, or take an old Hawaiian word and give it a new meaning,"" he said. He explained some of the challenges in translating terms, such as ""browsing"" or ""surfing,"" into Hawaiian. ""People use the term 'surf the Internet' and they'll say 'he'e nalu' which is literally surfing the ocean out on a board,"" he explained. ""But we use 'kele,' which is what you do when you're steering a canoe. So we chose that as you're navigating the net."" Donaghy finished the translation project in April, but there were issues with the code for the search engine that would not activate the Hawaiian language interface. The Hawaiian language interface actually launched on Apple's Safari browser first because Donaghy had worked with Apple to ensure that the language's diacritical marks and characters were available on the company's computers. ""Now, it comes with every computer that they ship,"" he said.  See and hear phrases in Hawaiian » . Some Apple computer users who had selected Hawaiian as their primary language for other programs noticed a couple of weeks ago that Google's search terms started appearing in Hawaiian, too. ""People started calling me and asking, 'Did you hack into my computer? My Google is in Hawaiian,'"" Donaghy said. ""And that was the point I said, 'OK, word is getting out about this' and I put out a news release. I was afraid someone was going to start freaking out, 'Why is my computer in Hawaiian?'"" Important milestone for Hawaii's culture . The initiative is an important milestone for Hawaiian linguists and cultural educators who have pushed to have their native language taught in schools alongside English. It wasn't until the 1980s that the law banning the Hawaiian language from being taught in schools was overturned. The law was established in the late 19th century as a prerequisite to Hawaii becoming a U.S. territory. Today, more and more Hawaiians are studying and majoring in Hawaiian language programs. There are Hawaiian language immersion programs in which English is taught as a second language. Mona Wood, a Hawaiian speaker and owner of a public relations firm in Honolulu, said there has been a kind of Hawaiian language ""renaissance"" in the state since the late 1970s. ""Even tourism has been learning and growing and realizing that our 'host culture' must be added to the visitor experience,"" Wood said. ""There are many more programs available at hotels and shopping malls that weren't there 20 years ago."" Wood said that when she studied Hawaiian in college, it was under the foreign languages department. ""It has been so wonderful to see so many of our youth embrace the native culture and see the programs expand to the point where there is an entire Hawaiian Studies Department,"" she said. ""One can now get a B.A. (Bachelor of Arts) and M.A. (Master of Arts) in Hawaiian language."" Wood -- who owns Ikaika Communications, which represents local officials, local and national companies and celebrities including Duane ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" Chapman -- said that when she was growing up, ""Our culture was dying in every way."" ""Learning my roots came through my own curiosity -- choosing to take hula lessons when my mom wanted me to take piano,"" she said. ""Then I went to the Hawaiian High School, Kamehameha, and continued with some Hawaiian classes and joined a club at UH (University of Hawaii). ""Seeing Hawaiian knowledge becoming an asset over the years has been truly satisfying,"" she said. Donaghy hopes the Google initiative is another step toward giving Hawaiian ""the same status as English and other major European and Asian languages"" -- particularly in the fast-moving sector of technology. ""To me personally it's very important that we are giving the opportunity to have as many things in Hawaiian as in English,"" he said. ""So if we had not begun to address technology in the early 1990s, we would be telling people that this is a place where Hawaiian doesn't belong. You have to revert to English. ""We didn't want to send that kind of message so we've worked to make the language more accessible.""","Google search terms now available in Hawaiian .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two separate militant assaults Saturday in the southeastern Afghan province of Paktika led to the deaths of two U.S. soldiers and at least 42 insurgents, military officials said. U.S. Marines, under fire from a building, move to take it Saturday in Helmand province, Afghanistan. The soldiers died when Taliban fighters attacked a base in Zerok that houses members of the U.S. military, Afghan national police and Afghan National Army, said the provincial governor's spokesman, Hamidullah Zawak. He said the Taliban first detonated a truck full of explosives, then attacked the base with missiles and rockets. The military responded by sending in aircraft and dropping bombs, killing 32 Taliban fighters and wounding many, Zawak said, without giving a number. Seven of the wounded Taliban fighters were arrested. Zawak said one U.S. soldier was killed and another wounded. Sgt. Chuck Marsh, however, a U.S. military spokesman, said two U.S. service members were killed and four wounded. Two soldiers from the Afghan National Army were also hurt, Zawak said. A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to a CNN stringer in Kabul. Several hours later, at least 10 militants were killed and one detained in an assault on a combat outpost in the province. Insurgents attacked with indirect fire, including multiple rockets and mortars -- at least one of which contained white phosphorous -- small-arms fire and a car bomb, according to a statement from NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Soldiers from ISAF and the Afghan National Army fired back, aided by planes and attack helicopters. No civilian casualties were reported. In other developments in and around Paktika: . • On Saturday, a suicide car bomb detonated near a private security company in Lashkar Gah city in Helmand province. One person was killed and five were wounded, said Assadullah Sherzad, Helmand provincial police chief. • The U.S.-led Operation Khanjar, or Strike of the Sword, is targeting Taliban militants in Helmand province, near Paktika in southern Afghanistan.  Thousands of U.S. Marines and Afghan soldiers are trying to rout the Taliban from strongholds in the Helmand River Valley. The operation began early Thursday. Helmand's poppy crop produces more than half of the opium cultivated in Afghanistan, the source of 90 percent of the global supply, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. The revenues help support the Taliban. • On Tuesday, a U.S. soldier was abducted in Paktika province. The Taliban claimed responsibility. A senior U.S. military official later said the soldier was being held by the militant Haqqani clan, a Taliban-affiliated network led by warlord Siraj Haqqani. The Haqqanis -- who operate on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistani borders -- are well-known to the U.S. military, which said it was using all means to locate the soldier, whose name has not been released.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- For Olympic swimmer Eric Shanteau, the last two months have been a whirlwind. ""Full of the best moments and the scariest moments of my life,"" says the 24-year-old Olympic swimmer. Eric Shanteau said he felt angry when he found out he had testicular cancer. ""Getting to the Olympics was, has always been, my swimming dream since I was 8 or 9 years old. You know, right after I started swimming it was, 'I want to make an Olympic team. That's where I want to be'."" In June, a week before the qualifying round of the Olympics he was told he had testicular cancer. ""My initial reaction was probably anger more than anything else,"" he says. ""I'm used to being in control of everything. I'm in control of how I train, how I race and then to all of a sudden have that control ripped away from me was tough."" After weeks of tests to determine the ""stage"" or spread of the cancer, Shanteau's team of doctors cleared him to compete in the Beijing Olympics, which meant carefully monitoring his tumor but delaying treatment. Though putting off the surgery was controversial to some, Eric says it was an educated choice based on numerous doctor evaluations. ""I hope people understand that if I was in a different position with my test results, then I wouldn't have put off having surgery."" He swam a personal best in the 200 meter breaststroke. He did not qualify for the finals. Cancer was a motivator, he says, because he knew it meant he could be facing his last competition. He put everything he had into that heat. ""Leave it all in the pool, and I don't look back and regret anything as far as how I raced."" Once back from Beijing, Shanteau invited CNN to spend time with him the night before his surgery in Atlanta, Georgia. Though admittedly a little scared, he spent the evening relaxing with his family, cooking dinner, walking the dog. A source of inspiration, he says, were fans who shared their stories of beating cancer. ""They send me their story and it helps me to learn that people are going through the same thing I am all over the world,"" says Shanteau. ""They all affect me in a different way and it's been really encouraging to share in this experience with other people."" Testicular cancer will be diagnosed in about 1 in 300 men in their lifetime. It is the most common form of cancer for 15- to 34-year-olds. It is also one of the most curable if discovered early. Nearly 140,000 men in the United States are testicular cancer survivors. Shanteau says he experienced no symptoms of cancer and came across the tumor by chance. ""I've been in a Speedo half my life,"" he says. ""So I am really comfortable with my body. One day I just felt something that wasn't suppose to be there. I decided to go and get it checked out."" He adds that although he had the ""greatest excuse in the world"" -- an Olympic dream -- to ignore the lump, he understood the importance of early detection. Shanteau's father Rick, is battling lung cancer and responding well to treatment. ""A lot of guys, if they hear a rattle in their car, they're at the mechanic the next day,"" he says. ""But if they feel something [physically] that they don't think should be there, it takes them a year to get to their doctor and that's just is not smart . There's really no excuse because it can save your life."" Fast forward to Shanteau's recent operation at Emory University Hospital. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta was with Shanteau during the surgery and spoke with the lead surgeon, Dr. Jeff Carney, moments afterward. ""I think the operation went very well,"" Carney said. ""Eric's a very healthy young man, very thin, in excellent shape. That makes my job easy."" Later that week, Shanteau's pathology results revealed that the operation removed the most of the cancer. ""The majority of it is gone."" he tells CNN. ""There is a small chance it could come back but I shouldn't need chemotherapy at this point, so I am really optimistic."" His treatment plan is to keep a close eye on his health for the next year with regular medical tests. ""Obviously, it would have been nice if the doctor said, 'You're completely in the clear,' but my results are exactly what the doctors expected."" Eric says the cancer diagnosis gave him a different perspective on life. ""I appreciate life much more now,"" he says. ""I don't let myself get upset about the little nitpicky things anymore. Food even seems to taste better. It is really great."" As for Shanteau's swimming career, he plans to compete in the 2009 World Swimming Championship in Rome. ""2012 [the next Olympics] is a push for me. Right now I'm just kind of taking it year by year and we'll see what happens.""","Olympic swimmer Eric Shanteau found out about his cancer in June .

"(CNN)  -- Typhoon Morakot dumped heavy rain on Taiwan early Saturday and threatened to further soak the recently drought-stricken island. A man fights against strong winds in Hsintien, Taipei county, Taiwan, on Friday. As of 3 a.m. local time, the storm's eye was over the northern part of the island, CNN forecaster Kevin Corriveau reported, although he noted that slow-moving Morakot is so large it encompassed the entire island. Journalist Andrew Lee in Taipei, citing local media, said the storm had blown off roofs and washed out some bridges. Corriveau said the island has received more than 39 inches (99 centimeters) of rain from the storm, which he said was expected to dump another 39 to 47 inches (99 to 119 centimeters) of rain on Taiwan. The storm made landfall carrying winds of up to 92 mph (148 km/h), with gusts up to 115 mph (185 km/h), the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said. iReport.com: See balcony view of heavy rains . Corriveau said the storm was expected to linger over the island for several more hours, and the southern portion of Morakot would likely be passing over Taiwan for hours after that. The storm's impact had already been felt by Friday morning, with mudslides and landslides occurring on the island. The area has been severely affected by drought in recent months, leaving the ground so hard that it does not absorb the rainfall, Corriveau said. Taiwan's Central News Agency, acknowledging the drought, cited the Water Resources Agency as saying that the storm had replenished the island's reservoirs and would put an end to water rationing in several areas.  Watch more about the typhoon's impact » . The storm prompted airlines to cancel flights. Schools and government offices were closed ahead of Morakot's arrival, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency. Trading at the Taiwan Stock Exchange was also postponed until Monday, the news agency reported. In China, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that governments in coastal provinces were readying themselves for the storm and had ordered fishing boats to seek shelter before Thursday night.

"(CNN) -- From the time she was an 11-year-old, blue-eyed, freckle-faced blonde until she was a 29-year-old woman with two children, Jaycee Dugard was kept locked away in a backyard compound of sheds and tarps by a couple who police say abducted her. Jaycee Dugard was locked in a shed tucked under a blue tarp in her alleged captor's backyard. She was more than 160 miles from home, and her family had no idea where she was. Nobody else knew she was there except the couple who snatched her off the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1991, and took her straight to the soundproof shed, police said. Dugard's pocket of Phillip and Nancy Garrido's backyard in Antioch, California, was so overgrown no one even knew it existed. The details about Dugard's time in captivity emerged Thursday after one of Northern California's most enduring mysteries was solved and the Garridos were arrested and accused of her kidnapping. Anyone who came across the couple's backyard, littered with garbage cans and a dishwasher, would assume that it ended at a 6-foot fence.  Watch aerial images of the backyard compound » . ""You could walk through the backyard and never know there was another set of living circumstances,"" said Fred Kollar, undersheriff of El Dorado County. ""There was nothing that would cause you to question it. You can't see it from either adjoining property. It was presumably well arranged."" But tucked away beyond the tangle of bushes, high grass and trees was a blue tarp that concealed the only world Dugard had known since her abduction. Kollar said the property had ""a hidden backyard within a backyard."" It included several sheds no taller than 6 feet, two tents and several outbuildings, ""where Jaycee and the girls spent most of their lives."" It also held a vehicle that matched the description of the car used in Dugard's kidnapping, Kollar said. The ""secondary"" backyard was inside the first and was ""screened from view."" One of the sheds was soundproof, he said. In it were sheds and tarps, a makeshift bathroom and shower, along with electricity supplied by extension cords. Kollar compared the primitive conditions to camping. Dugard lived for several years there by herself. The sheds were locked from the outside. She grew up and had her captor's children there, and raised them there. ""None of them have ever been to school, they've never been to a doctor,"" Kollar said. ""They were kept in complete isolation in this compound, if you will, at the rear of the house,"" he said. ""They were born there."" The children, both girls, are now 15 and 11. ""They are all in good health,"" Kollar said in response to a question about how Dugard and her children are doing. ""But living in a backyard for the last 18 years does take its toll."" Dugard's presence behind Garrido's home apparently went unnoticed by many in the neighborhood, where homes on one-fourth to one-half-acre lots typically sell for less than $200,000.  Watch neighbors react » . ""My dad said he never saw a young woman,"" said Kathy Russo, whose father has lived two houses away from the Garridos for 33 years. She said the one-story house's backyard was obscured by trees and ringed by a wooden fence. Her 94-year-old father considered Garrido to be a ""kind of strange, reclusive, kind of an angry kind of guy,"" Russo said. But one man who lives in the neighborhood told CNN that he called the local sheriff's department a few years ago after seeing what he thought were several children living in the backyard. The man said authorities came out and had a brief conversation with the Garrido family, but nothing ever happened.","NEW: Neighbor says he once called police after seeing children in backyard .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations is calling on NATO to do more to stop the Afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates Afghanistan's economy. Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007. The report from the U.N.'s Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at around $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006. Despite Afghan security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said. Opium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground. The report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product in 2007. InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year. According to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade. Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001. ""Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,"" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. ""Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source."" James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade. ""We share the U.N.'s concerns,"" Appathurai told CNN. ""Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation."" He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly. ""The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,"" Appathurai said. Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said. However, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked. According to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes. Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region. He called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors. ""Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,"" the U.N. drug chief said. Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production. ""You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,"" he said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Brand new runways are opening at three major airports Thursday, giving the aviation community something to cheer about in a year of dismal economic and travel news. Washington Dulles International Airport's new runway opens Thursday ahead of the busy holiday travel season. Washington Dulles International Airport will get a fourth runway, its first runway addition since the airport opened in 1962. Chicago's O'Hare International Airport's new runway is part of a massive, multi-billion dollar modernization program. Previously, six of the airport's seven runways intersected. When the entire project is completed in 2014, the airport will have eight runways in parallel configurations considered safer and more efficient. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport's new runway is being especially welcomed because of the region's notoriously wet climate. The airport's third runway will allow planes to take off and land two abreast during inclement weather. The current runways are too close to allow simultaneous operations in foul weather. Airport officials claim the new runway will cut delays in half. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said travelers will benefit from coast to coast.  See runways at the three airports » . ""It is going to make a difference,"" Peters said. ""It is going to allow us to conduct more operations, meaning more takeoffs and landings per hour at these airports and will help move passengers efficiently through. ""That, we hope, will give travelers a good experience this holiday season,"" she said. President Bush, this week, touted the arrival of the three new runways, noting that 14 new runways will have opened during his administration. However, aviation experts warn airport infrastructure still lags behind demand, and that real estate realities in the New York area, perceived to be the epicenter of aviation delays, mean that new runways are least likely to be built where they are most needed.  Watch what Web sites offer best travel deals » . ""It would really be nice if we had even one new runway"" at each of the nation's most congested airports, namely LaGuardia, Newark and JFK,"" aviation consultant Darryl Jenkins said. ""It would do an enormous amount to relieve congestion throughout the entire nation."" iReport.com: What are your holiday travel plans? Jenkins said new runways in New York are pipe dreams because of land constraints and local opposition. ""Local opposition wins. There's no opposition that is as tough to beat down as local opposition,"" he said. Chicago O'Hare's International Airport, which has purchased more than 500 single-family homes to make room for expansion, remains in court battles with several property owners. Aviation experts argue the experience at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia demonstrate that new runways are invaluable to airlines and travelers. A new runway that opened there in 2006 has increased operations by 25 to 30 flights an hour, shaved minutes off average flight delays and saved airlines $10 million a week in fuel costs, airport officials said. Air traffic controllers are generally happy with the added concrete they will lord over. ""There's no greater supporter of runways than controllers,"" said Doug Church, spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA). ""It's reason to shout and celebrate from the rooftops."" However, the new Dulles airport runway may not be of much benefit at the start. Controller Chris Sutherland, the NATCA representative for the Potomac Consolidated Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), explained that because only one taxiway has been completed, planes that land heading north must roll to a stop, turn around and taxi more than a mile and a half to the taxiway, costing the airlines both time and money. ""Bottom line, the users are going to fight us tooth and nail if we try to land them on that runway out there,"" Sutherland said. The airport also does not have the technology necessary to use all three parallel runways in inclement weather, he said. ""We're actually creating delays with additional new concrete and that's kind of going against why we built it in the first place,"" Sutherland said. An airport official and Department of Transportation officials said Washington-Dulles International Airport must open the new runway before it can close the center runway and complete work on the remaining taxiways. Work is scheduled for the spring. Jenkins jokingly said new runways inevitably come on line precisely when they are not needed, but he said airline delays are here to stay. ""There's every reason to believe that until we're all comfortably dead, we will all enjoy delays in air traffic,"" Jenkins said.","New airport runways open Thursday in Seattle, Chicago and Washington .

"(CNN) -- Ryan Alexander Jenkins, a reality TV contestant suspected in his wife's slaying, was found hanging from a coat rack in a motel room in an apparent suicide, according to Canadian officials. Police were hunting for Ryan Alexander Jenkins after the death of Jasmine Fiore. Staff at a motel in Hope, British Columbia, found Jenkins dead, officials said. ""It was a man hanging by a belt from a coat rack,"" Kevin Walker, the manager of the budget Thunderbird Motel, told CNN affiliate CTV on Sunday. Walker said a woman, about 20 to 25 years old, dropped off Jenkins at the motel on Friday in a silver Chrysler PT Cruiser with Alberta tags. Police have not been able to identify the woman.  Watch how suspect found in hotel » . Earlier Sunday, Canadian authorities said they had credible information that Jenkins was in Canada and called on him to turn himself in. He was believed to be armed and dangerous.  Watch what led police to hotel room » . The nude body of Jenkins' wife, former swimsuit model Jasmine Fiore, was found last weekend in Orange County, California. CNN has not confirmed reports that the marriage was annulled. Fiore's body was found last Saturday in a Dumpster behind an apartment complex in Buena Park, just outside Anaheim, California. Her teeth had been extracted and fingers removed in what police said was an apparent attempt to conceal her identity. Law enforcement sources have told CNN that Fiore was identified through the serial numbers on her breast implants. Fiore lived in Los Angeles and was last seen alive in San Diego at a poker game with Jenkins, the night before the body was found. Jenkins reported Fiore missing last Saturday night to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, authorities said. The body was identified Monday as Fiore. While the cause of death had not been confirmed, a preliminary coroner's report indicated she was strangled. According to court records in Las Vegas, Nevada, Jenkins was charged in June with battery for allegedly striking Fiore in the arm with his fist. And in 2007, Jenkins pleaded guilty in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to assault in a separate case. He was sentenced to 15 months probation, ordered to undergo counseling for domestic violence and sex addiction and to stay away from the person involved, according to court records. Jenkins, who appeared on the VH1 show ""Megan Wants a Millionaire,"" is from Calgary. 51Minds, which produced ""Megan Wants a Millionaire,"" said Thursday in a written statement that it ""was not aware of Ryan Jenkins' record when it cast him. ""The company did have in place what it thought was a thorough vetting process that involved complete background checks by an outside company for all contestants on its shows,"" it said. ""Clearly, the process did not work properly in this case. 51 Minds is investigating what went wrong and taking steps to ensure that this sort of lapse never occurs again.""

"(CNN) -- World-record signing Cristiano Ronaldo scored on his debut as Real Madrid kicked off the Spanish football season with a shaky 3-2 victory at home to Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday night. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after paying off a small chunk of his record transfer fee with a goal on his Real debut. Real's new generation of ""Galacticos"" were preceded onto the pitch by the world's fastest man Usain Bolt, with the Jamaican sprint star dribbling a ball to the delight of a packed Bernabeu crowd. Coach Manuel Pellegrini fielded seven new signings against a team who stunned Real 2-1 on the opening day last season to foreshadow a season of massive upheaval for the underachieving capital club. The first goal took just 26 minutes in coming as $92 million signing Kaka fed the ball to $50 million capture Karim Benzema, whose shot rebounded off the post and fell welcomingly to Real captain Raul to score. Ronaldo, who cost $130 million when he left Manchester United, then rose highest to meet a free-kick from $50 million midfielder Xavi Alonso but headed over the bar. Deportivo stunned the home crowd in the 30th minute when former Real striker Riki was allowed a free header to equalize in the type of defensive lapse that typified Madrid's performances last season. But while Pellegrini has obvious problems to sort out at the back, where he fielded debutants Ezequiel Garay and Raul Albiol in the absence of the suspended Pepe, he has volumes of attacking resources at the other end of the pitch. His team took the lead again in the 34th minute through Ronaldo, who coolly slotted home from the penalty spot after Raul went down under goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia's challenge following a clever pass from midfielder Lassana Diarra. However, Real could not hold onto the lead, with veteran Juan Carlos Valeron firing a leveler from the edge of the area just 43 seconds into the second half following a cross by Andres Guardado. Valeron should have made it 3-2 with an even easier chance 12 minutes later, but he sidefooted another pass from Guardado wide of the Real goal. Real continued to pile forward in numbers, peppering the Deportivo goal, but it was the unexpected figure of Diarra who netted the eventual winner in the 60th minute with a low drive from outside the box. Benzema should have doubled the lead soon after following a mistake by Aranzubia, but saw his chip over the keeper rebound off the bar. The Frenchman made way for last season's top scorer Higuain in the 72nd minute, with the Argentine lucky to avoid being booked for a blatant dive in the penalty area. Real's rivals Barcelona start the defense of their title on Monday at home to Sporting Gijon, having already won a trophy this season by beating Shakhtar Donetsk 1-0 in the European Super Cup on Friday.","World-record signing Cristiano Ronaldo scores on his debut for Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- Former Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr will reunite on stage next month to raise money to teach transcendental meditation to children around the world to ""help provide them a quiet haven in a not-so-quiet world,"" McCartney said. Paul McCartney (above) and Ringo Starr are teaming up for a fund-raising concert. The star-studded list of performers who will join them include two musicians who were with the Beatles when they journeyed to India's Himalayan foothills in 1968 to learn transcendental meditation from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. ""In moments of madness, it has helped me find moments of serenity,"" McCartney said in the concert announcement. Profits from the April 4 show at New York's Radio City Music Hall will fund the David Lynch Foundation's program, which has already taught 60,000 children around the world how to meditate, foundation spokesman Steve Yellin said. The goal of the project -- which is called ""Change Begins Within"" -- is to teach the meditation technique to a million at-risk children so they have ""life-long tools to overcome stress and violence and promote peace and success in their lives,"" Yellin said. Schools across the United States have asked the group to bring the classes to their students, he said. ""I would like to think that it would help provide them a quiet haven in a not-so-quiet world,"" McCartney said. Singer-songwriter Donovan and musician Paul Horn, who studied at the Maharishi's ashram with the four Beatles, will also perform in the show. ""How great to be playing with Paul, Ringo, and Paul Horn again -- as we did in India in 1968,"" Donovan said. ""It's a real reunion after 40 years of Donovan, Paul Horn, Ringo and Paul McCartney,"" Yellin said. ""It's quite an interesting thing that they are still talking about transcendental meditation."" Ringo left the ashram after just 10 days -- explaining the food was too spicy for his taste -- and McCartney stayed for six weeks, according to journalist Lewis Lapham in his book ""With the Beatles."" McCartney and John Lennon wrote many of the songs for the Beatles' White Album while there, but the group disbanded within two years. The list of performers also includes Sheryl Crow, Eddie Vedder, Ben Harper, Moby, Bettye LaVette and Jim James. Tickets go on sale Monday, March 9, through Ticketmaster.","Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr participating in fund-raising concert .

"CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- Suzanne Hagelof and Iris Botros dreamed of adopting babies. Separately, they visited orphanages in Egypt. Hagelof adopted a child, and Botros was in the process of adopting twins, when they ran foul of authorities. Now they are in jail, accused of being part of a conspiracy to traffic children. Iris Botros and her husband, Luis Andros, are accused of trying to smuggle twins out of Egypt. Last week, the two women were led into a Cairo courtroom in handcuffs, along with six other people. They stood in a big black cage in the courtroom, looking apprehensive amid the hubbub. To their defenders, all they were trying to do was provide orphans with a better chance in life. To the prosecution, they were involved in forging documents to try to adopt children illegally and smuggle them out of the country. Along with the two American women, the accused include their husbands, two doctors, a nun who ran an orphanage, and an Egyptian banker. Watch the women get bundled into court » . A year ago, Hagelof, a U.S. citizen who lives in Egypt with her husband, adopted a child from an orphanage run by the Coptic Christian Church, a religious minority in Egypt. She says no money changed hands. Several months later, Luis Andros, a U.S. citizen who is originally from Greece, and his wife, Iris Botros, left their restaurant business in North Carolina for Egypt. Botros, who is originally from Egypt, visited another orphanage run by the church. She paid the orphanage about $4,600 for the twins -- partly for clothes and partly as a donation. Both women wanted to take the children to the United States -- in Hagelof's case for a visit, but in Botros' case to begin a new life in Wake Forest, North Carolina. And that's where the trouble began. To get a visa for the children, both women went to the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. According to their attorneys, the documents they presented included birth certificates and certificates signed by doctors stating they were the natural mothers. According to defense attorneys, the two women knew they were using forged documents. Embassy officials became suspicious of the documents -- partly because the women seemed too old to be the mothers. Both Hagelof and Botros are in their mid- to late forties. The embassy contacted Egyptian authorities, and both Hagelof and Botros -- along with their husbands -- were arrested soon afterward, as was a nun from a Coptic orphanage and a banker who allegedly helped Botros make contact with the nun. Also arrested were two doctors who had written the certificates for the three infants, all of whom are now at an orphanage not affiliated with the church. Neither the U.S. Embassy nor the U.S. State Department will comment on the case, citing the ongoing trial. Botros' husband, Andros, blames the embassy for their plight. Asked through the bars of the courtroom cage what had happened, he replied, ""Well, our American Embassy, instead of helping the people, they put them in jail."" His wife interjected, insisting they would not get a fair trial. A few feet away, Suzanne Hagelof called out, ""We want to tell our story,"" while her husband, Medhat, looked on, quiet and dejected. As reporters tried to talk to the defendants, a guard intervened, shouting ""Sit down, sit down."" Adoption has long been illegal under Egyptian law as well as being forbidden under sharia, Muslim religious law. Fostering is legal but uncommon. It has become a high-profile issue since Suzanne Mubarak, wife of the president, embarked on a campaign to stamp out human trafficking. She recently told CNN that human trafficking ""exists in all societies."" ""I came to realize what an insidious crime this was and how it was just really built on profit. On not only low morals, on no morals at all,"" she said. And that's how the prosecution seems to be framing this case, using a law passed last year that provides for tough penalties for human trafficking. Khalil Adil El Hamani, the attorney representing Hagelof, says Egyptian authorities want to prove that all the defendants are from one gang and are trafficking children, so as to make the case seem to be a giant conspiracy. Both couples insist they had no idea what they were doing was illegal and have no link with human trafficking. The attorney representing Botros and her husband says their only crime was to dream of being parents. ""They are now are in jail because of this dream,"" he told CNN after the first hearing in the case a week ago. ""They never thought that they will be in jail. They thought that they are going to adopt only. They didn't think they are making something against the law in Egypt."" All eight defendants remain in jail -- the men at the Tora prison in Cairo, well known for its overcrowding. The next stage of the trial takes place May 16, and proceedings could last six to eight months. If they are convicted, the accused could each face up to 10 years in prison.","Women adopted children from orphanage run by Coptic Christian Church .
