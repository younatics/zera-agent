"(CNN) -- Each year, Grammy Week offers up a full calendar of events -- each one boasting a guest list more spectacular than the next. But this year, the most coveted ticket was Friday night's ""2013 MusiCares Person of the Year Tribute"" honoring Bruce Springsteen. The evening's entertainment featured six Rock and Roll Hall of Famers, a few critically acclaimed young artists -- and The Boss himself. Neil Young and Crazy Horse turned up the volume with a spirited version of ""Born in the U.S.A,"" flanked by a pair of cheerleaders with the letter ""S"" emblazoned on their sweaters. Colombian superstar Juanes put a bilingual spin on ""Hungry Heart,"" singing verses in both Spanish and English, and John Legend transformed ""Dancing in the Dark"" into a jazzy piano ballad, which led Springsteen to later remark that ""he made me sound like Gershwin. I love that."" Other standout performances included Mumford & Sons' banjo-laced cover of ""I'm on Fire,"" Tom Morello and Jim James' mesmerizing take on ""The Ghost of Tom Joad,"" and country superstar Kenny Chesney's quietly effective rendition of ""One Step Up."" Elton John also opted for simplicity, accompanied only by his piano on ""Streets of Philadelphia."" But the most curious vocal of the night was on ""Lonesome Day,"" where Sting exhibited a raspy growl that suggested he was looking to honor Springsteen by sounding like him. The evening was part all-star concert, part fundraiser to benefit the MusiCares Foundation, the Recording Academy's philanthropic arm that provides assistance to members of the music industry. ""We take care of our own,"" said Springsteen, invoking the title of a song off his current Grammy-nominated album, ""Wrecking Ball."" When a live auction featuring a signed guitar wasn't generating enough interest, Springsteen took the microphone and upped the ante, throwing in a free guitar lesson with himself as the teacher, a ride in the side car of his Harley, eight tickets to the E Street concert of their choice, a backstage tour and lasagna made by his 87-year-old mother, Adele. A woman from New Jersey snapped it up for $250,000, then proceeded to kiss Springsteen on his lips. The 63-year-old music icon was honored for his philanthropic work, as well as his musical achievements. ""I am here tonight under totally false pretenses,"" he told the crowd of 3,000 packed into a ballroom at the Los Angeles Convention Center. ""Any philanthropy I've done involves me playing the guitar ... and I would have been playing the guitar anyway."" He then took the stage, launching into ""We Take Care of Our Own,"" ""Death to My Hometown,"" ""Thunder Road"" and ""Born to Run."" For his finale, Springsteen called for every musician in the building to join him onstage for ""Glory Days."" Neil Young grabbed a couple of drumsticks and banged on a snare, while Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Patti Smith, Sting, Jackson Browne, Emmylou Harris, Mumford & Sons, Ben Harper, Tom Morello and host Jon Stewart joined in the singalong. Also spotted in the audience: Springsteen's daughter, his mother and Sean Penn. 2013 MusiCares set list: .

"(CNN) -- European football's governing body, UEFA has revealed that 32 of its 54 member states have declared an interest in hosting matches at the 2020 European Championships. Traditionally, the tournament is hosted by one or two nations, but matches in 2020 will be shared between 13 cities across Europe. UEFA, who announced a change in format for the tournament's 60th anniversary last December, welcomed the enthusiastic response from the national football associations. ""We are extremely proud to see the huge interest in the bidding process, with more than half of our member associations willing to host matches at UEFA EURO 2020,"" UEFA President Michel Platini said. ""The finals will be a great celebration of football across the European continent, and the 60th anniversary edition will be truly special, by really coming to the doorstep of all football fans."" Platini initially floated the idea following the 2012 championships hosted by Poland and Ukraine and a decision to change the format was agreed by UEFA's Executive Committee last December before being confirmed in January. The format, dubbed a ""Euro for Europe,"" has attracted interest from reigning Euro champions, Spain and the other traditional powerhouses of European football -- Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Greece and England. ""UEFA's 'EURO for Europe' in 2020 promises to be a fitting way to recognise 60 years of the UEFA European Championship,"" said England Football Association secretary Alex Horne in a statement. ""It would be great to see England playing in front of their home fans here in London as part of a EURO Finals tournament but many countries have also put themselves forward as hosts and we expect this to be a very competitive bidding process."" Less illustrious footballing nations including Armenia, Israel, Kazakhstan and Wales have also thrown their hat into the ring. UEFA says all 32 associations can submit a maximum of two bids -- one which covers three group matches and one knockout round and another which will vie to host the semifinal and final. The closing date for bids is April 25 with UEFA's Executive Committee announcing the host cities on September 25 next year. The full list of countries and their proposed host cities is as follows: Armenia (Yerevan), Azerbaijan (Baku), Belarus (Minsk), Belgium (Brussels), Bulgaria (Sofia), Croatia (Zagreb), Czech Republic (Prague), Denmark (Copenhagen), England (London), Finland (Helsinki), France (Lyon), Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Skopje), Germany (Munich), Greece (Athens), Hungary (Budapest), Israel (Jerusalem), Italy (Rome, Milan), Kazakhstan (Astana), Netherlands (Amsterdam), Poland (Warsaw, Chorzow), Portugal (Lisbon, Porto), Republic of Ireland (Dublin), Romania (Bucharest), Russia (St Petersburg), Scotland (Glasgow), Serbia (Belgrade), Spain (Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia), Sweden (Solna), Switzerland (Basel), Turkey (Istanbul), Ukraine (Kyiv, Donetsk) and Wales (Cardiff).","European football's governing body reveals list of countries bidding to host 2020 finals .

"Kaiping, China (CNN) -- In a quiet corner of southern China's Pearl River Delta, hundreds of abandoned watchtowers dot a landscape of water-logged rice paddies, lush bamboo groves and ancient villages. Bristling with battlements and turrets, the ornate towers were built by families and villages in need of protection during the late 19th and early 20th centuries when much of the country was controlled by warlords and banditry was rife. Now a UNESCO world heritage site, these days the Kaiping watchtowers, or diaolou as they are known locally, face a threat of a different nature -- the incredible boom in Chinese tourism. The tiny village of Zili, which has the largest collection of towers, attracts dozens of tour buses on weekends. Their passengers are ushered around the towers by guides sporting red flags and microphones rigged up to loud speakers. They chase the skinny chickens that roam about the dirt paths, snap photos, sample ""peasant family food"" and buy rustic bamboo souvenirs, while the village's few remaining elderly residents sit on small plastic stools and look on bemused. It's a scene that's played out at other UNESCO sites across China, where world heritage status is increasingly being used as a economic vehicle to develop backward regions, says Chris Ryan, a professor of tourism at The University of Waikato in New Zealand. ""The idea behind having this status is that there are conservation, preservation and restoration issues, where in China it seems to be primarily geared toward promoting tourism and its economic benefit,"" says Ryan, who has studied Kaiping and another world heritage site in Anhui province, eastern China. China plans makeover for tourism in southeast Tibet . According to Ryan, Chinese made 2.6 billion trips last year, up from just over a billion seven years ago and numbers are expected to rise further. ""Places that were previously very remote and didn't see a lot of tourists are now seeing enormous numbers arriving because they have the money to travel,"" says Neville Agnew, group director of the Getty Conservation Institute, which has worked in China since 1989. ""It's an interesting phenomenon because it's in complete contrast to the experience in Egypt, where almost all the visitors are foreigners."" China now has 43 world heritage sites, the most of any country in the world. Dozens of other wannabe UNESCO sites across China are preparing bids. Jing Feng, the Paris-based chief of UNESCO's Asia and Pacific section, says that the prestige of world heritage inscription always means an increase in visitor numbers but acknowledges the pressures of mass tourism in China are particularly acute. ""People are getting richer and they have the right to appreciate heritage sites but we need a balance,"" he says. New parts of Great Wall of China to open to tourists . Tackling the problem is difficult. Jing singles out Lijiang, an ancient town set in a dramatic mountain landscape in the southwestern province of Yunnan, as a place that has struggled to accommodate a surge in tourists. Designated a world heritage site in 1997, the town, home to the matriarchal Dongba culture, now receives 11 million visitors a year and conservation experts have been shocked by the level of commercialization. Locals have moved out of the city's ancient core, renting their homes out to businesses. Jing was part of a UNESCO monitoring mission to the town in 2008 and local authorities have pledged to improve visitor management and shut the discos and karaoke bars that had sprung up. However, a doubling of admission ticket prices in a bid to reduce visitor numbers has had little impact and officials aim to increase visitor number to 16 million by 2015. UNESCO has only twice removed world heritage sites from its list and Jing says there is little chance, for now at least, that any Chinese sites would lose the designation because authorities had put forward ""corrective measures."" Ethnic Mongolians in China concerned about cultural threat . Poor, rural areas bypassed by China's recent economic boom are those most keen to secure world heritage status, says Han Li, who works for the Global Heritage Fund in China. Local officials often take out huge loans to build infrastructure to prepare their bid, she says, and local people, at least, initially welcome the opportunity to find work outside farming or as alternative to migration. ""Having world heritage status definitely changes your property values, your investment opportunities and it's a really big life-saver for a lot of these places,"" she says. Officials in charge of Kaiping's watchtowers have said they aim to attract up to 2 million visitors each year, up from 100,000 in 2007 when it was first inscribed as a world heritage site with a view to generating revenues of 50 million yuan (US$7.8 million). How this money will be spent will be key to the future of Kaiping's watchtowers. So far, it appears that much of the money generated has been spent on car parks, ticket booths and landscaping in the four villages featured in tourist brochures. It's not clear what will happen to the hundreds of other towers not earmarked for tourist development. They are used as barns and storage sheds or stand empty and forlorn despite their protected status. Many were abandoned after the Communist victory in 1949 when those with overseas ties fled. More recently, villagers have left for the booming factory towns on the other side of the Pearl River Delta. Xanadu added to UNESCO's world heritage list . The challenge for the local authorities in Kaiping, and at China's other heritage sites, is how to manage tourists visits so that they bring maximum economic benefit without harming the heritage sites and those who live nearby. One radical solution is to limit visitor numbers. For example, from next year the Mogao Grottoes in remote Northwestern China plans to allow 6,000 visitors per day, down from up to 11,000 at present, says Agnew at the Getty Conservation Institute. The move follows fears that the moisture from visitors' breath and sweat was harming the centuries-old cave paintings and Buddhist sculptures. But this approach is unlikely to be adopted widely, especially at living sites such as Lijiang's old town and Kaiping, where economic imperatives are most likely to trump heritage preservation. ""World heritage sites don't need to be static -- they can bring income and development,"" says Li at the Global Heritage Fund. ""But I think it's important to remember that heritage does have its own inherent value and it's not just about a tangible financial return.""","China has 43 world heritage sites, the most of any country .

"(CNN) -- Call it confidence, or call it arrogance -- but whatever it is, Sebastian Vettel certainly has it. Already 53 points clear in his bid for a fourth consecutive world Formula One title, and seeking his third successive race victory, the Red Bull driver did not even bother trying to set a second lap in final qualifying for Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix. So assured was the German that he was quickest on Saturday at Marina Bay, a grueling street circuit where he has triumphed under lights the past two years, he sat in the team garage and watched his rivals try in vain to beat his leading lap time. ""It was weird standing in the garage with roughly two minutes to go,"" the 26-year-old told reporters. ""It then became much worse with the others making their final attempt and there's nothing you can do."" Interactive: See how F1 lights up Singapore . However, Mercedes' Nico Rosberg fell just short of Vettel's one minute 42.841 seconds, with the German clocking 1:42.932. Lotus' Romain Grosjean was third fastest in 1:43.058, and the Frenchman will be joined on the second row of the grid by Vettel's teammate Mark Webber (1:43.152). Webber was fastest in the first sector, Rosberg quickest in the second and Grosjean in the third, but Vettel's burst in the final section gave him the 41st pole position of his career . ""I watched the sector times closely with Romain, Nico and Mark, but fortunately my last sector was strong enough to stay ahead of Nico,"" said Vettel, who was fastest in Friday's second practice and edged Grosjean in Saturday's final warmup. ""In the end it was a great feeling because it could have gone wrong. Yesterday the gap to the others was a surprise, but today was more what we expected."" Rosberg is seeking his first podium placing since winning the British Grand Prix five races ago in late June. ""Seb has been really quick all weekend,"" the 28-year-old said. ""It was very close in the end. One tenth (of a second) more would have been possible, but second is still a good result. ""We've good race pace and I'm very confident for tomorrow."" His teammate Lewis Hamilton, who won the race in 2009 for McLaren, was fifth fastest ahead of Felipe Massa -- who again out-qualified his Ferrari teammate Fernando Alonso. Alonso, the Singapore victor in 2008 and 2010, was seventh -- while Kimi Raikkonen, who will join the Spaniard at the Prancing Horse next year, will start in 13th after failing to reach Q3 for Lotus as he struggled with a back problem. Alonso, who is second overall, and fellow title hopefuls Hamilton and Raikkonen will need significant improvements on Sunday if they are to stop Vettel extending his lead in the drivers' championship. It had been reported that McLaren wanted Alonso to return to the team where he had one unhappy season in 2007, but he said after qualifyingn that he hoped to end his career at Ferrari. ""I've spent the last four races saying I want to stay at Ferrari and maybe extend the contract when they would like,"" the 32-year-old said. ""We are working very closely on arriving at that situation. To sit together and to try to do it, that's my desire, and the team has expressed to me more or less the same desire when we talk about this."" Raikkonen said he would start on Sunday, despite problems with a trapped nerve. ""This morning was very bad,"" the Finn said. ""I couldn't really try, so we probably didn't get done what we wanted with the car, but at least we got it on the grid and we'll see what we can do in the race. ""It was good we drove in qualifying in the end, but it was not that nice."" McLaren's Jenson Button qualified eighth ahead of Toro Rosso's Daniel Ricciardo, who will replace fellow Australian Webber at Red Bull next year. Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez completed the top 10, with the Mexican beating teammate Nico Hulkenberg for the first time this year. He will start the race with a choice of tire compounds after declining to set a time in Q3.","F1 championship leader Sebastian Vettel wins pole position in Singapore .

"(CNN) -- After the vote in the House of Representatives to slash the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, I wrote a column against cutting food stamps. This column generated more than 5,200 online comments and hundreds of e-mails. Comments reflected, not surprisingly, the tone and tenor of the political debate: a lot of partisan passion, some mutual understanding, animosity based on stereotypes and a lot of misinformation. I would like to address some of the typical concerns that were expressed. For example, ""Willis CurryFans"" wrote, ""These wealthy Republicans spend a lot of time RUNNING from the typical black person this affects. If they came and visited some of these neighborhoods, they would see folks that they KNOW they won't give a job to."" But who are the people using food stamps? They're us. The Census Bureau, which gathers statistics house by house, reports that Americans on food stamps are 49% white, 26% African-American and 20% Hispanic. The Pew Research Center, a nonprofit polling firm, found in a July survey that self-identified liberals, moderates and conservatives who receive food stamps are in a statistical tie. A lot of people who commented on the column wanted to regulate what foodstuffs program participants can buy -- often not realizing that alcohol and prepared foods are banned. And many respondents bashed food stamp recipients, declaring they should ""get a job,"" ""stop having kids on my dime"" or giving a variation on such cliches. ""Chiefpr"" writes to one reader who's been out of work: ""Get training to better yourself and DO NOT have kids until you can feed them. But do not demand I do all that and support you ..."" But the truth refutes the cliches: Feeding America says participation in SNAP, or the food stamp program, ""historically follows unemployment with a slight lag."" Unemployment increases food stamp rolls, not people with children who go looking for aid. And unemployment has been abnormally high because of the recession that began under the previous president. In fact, USA Today found that ""under President George W. Bush, the number of recipients rose by nearly 14.7 million. Nothing before comes close to that."" With employment increasing, ""the Congressional Budget Offices projects SNAP participation to begin declining in 2015."" Shaun Kirkpatrick commented: ""There was a work requirement for welfare. Bill Clinton did that during his welfare reform that most working people applauded. To make sure he got the votes and make Republicans look greedy and evil, Obama removed the work requirement ..."" Kirkpatrick's perception is prevalent on the Web. But that information comes from a 2012 Mitt Romney political ad that got it dead wrong. Obama actually encouraged the states to strengthen their work requirements. Also, of course, welfare is not the same as food stamps. As for food stamps, more than 72% of all SNAP beneficiaries are families with children. Most of the recipients are children (48%), the elderly (8%) and the disabled. Less than 10% of food stamp recipients receive welfare payments. ""John in WNY"" wrote, ""Yes, many do work, but many of them make sure they never make enough to lose their benefits ..."" Again, the facts refute the assumption. SNAP has strict time limits for unemployed workers: Able-bodied adults without children can only get three months worth of food stamps in a three-year period, unless working in a qualifying job training program. And how much are the benefits, anyway? The average monthly SNAP benefit per person is $133.85, or less than $1.50 per person per meal. Those benefits are low, and for many families, SNAP benefits don't last the whole month. Why do we need to support the food stamp program? Because low-income families experience unemployment at a far higher rate than other income groups. Because cutting nutritional assistance programs is immoral and shortsighted and protecting families from hunger improves their health and educational outcomes. Food stamps are an investment in our future. Being on food stamps can be demeaning. Cashiers know the difference between the new plastic SNAP cards and a credit card. Some food stamp recipients say some cashiers have made them feel uncomfortable and embarrassed. Maybe we should focus on rewards rather than punishments. Behavioral psychologists say that's more effective. Why not add benefits for making healthy food choices, provide a transition bonus for getting off food stamps or increase job training opportunities and income -- raising minimum wage? Doing so takes courage, compassion and believing in ""We, the people."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile says her column on food stamps got tons of comments, many misinformed .
Brazile: Recipients are 49% white, 26% black, 20% Hispanic; conservative and liberal .

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- Nine people were killed and seven others were wounded after a group of militants attacked security forces in Indian-administered Kashmir on Thursday, authorities said. The unrest in the territory, long disputed by India and Pakistan, comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between the two countries' prime ministers on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. Two to three militants in army fatigues attacked a police station early Thursday in Hiranagar, a town about 60 kilometers (35 miles) from the city of Jammu, said Rajesh Kumar, inspector general of police for the Jammu area. ""The militants forced their entry into the police station, opened indiscriminate fire and fled,"" he said. Four police officers and and two civilians were killed in the attack, he said, and two civilians and a police officer were wounded. Kumar said the militants fled in a truck and drove to an Indian Army camp in the nearby town of Samba where they opened fire on soldiers. Three military service members were killed and three others were wounded in the ensuing gun battle, which was continuing, said army spokesman S.N. Acharya. Meeting planned . The violence took place as Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif are in New York for the UNGA. Singh has said he will meet with Sharif, among other leaders, at the event. Reports in the Indian news media have said the two men are due to hold talks on Sunday. Singh condemned the Kashmir attack in a statement released by his office, linking violence in the region to Pakistan. ""This is one more in a series of provocations and barbaric actions by the enemies of peace,"" he said. ""We are firmly resolved to combat and defeat the terrorist menace that continues to receive encouragement and reinforcement from across the border."" But he said that ""such attacks will not deter us and will not succeed in derailing our efforts to find a resolution to all problems through a process of dialogue."" The statement didn't specifically mention Singh's planned meeting with Sharif. The attack took place hours after the Indian and Pakistani armies had traded small-arms and automatic weapon fire in the district of Poonch on the Line of Control, the de-facto border between the two countries in Kashmir, according to Acharya. The exchange of gunfire is the latest in a string of small-scale clashes along the frontier this year. Hiranagar and Samba, where the militants struck Thursday, are both within about 10 kilometers of the Line of Control. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Militants open fire at a police station and then an army camp, authorities say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal health officials on Thursday are unveiling a $54 million national media campaign to get smokers to quit and prevent anyone else, especially children, from starting. The campaign, called ""Tips From Former Smokers,"" is intended to educate Americans about the dangers of smoking through the stories and graphic pictures of ex-smokers who have suffered severe health consequences of tobacco use. The former smokers profiled have suffered ailments such as stroke-related paralysis, limb amputation, lung removal and heart attack. One breathes through a stoma, a surgically created hole in the neck through which a person who has undergone larynx or voice box surgery can breathe. ""Hundreds of thousands of lives are lost each year due to smoking, and for every person who dies, 20 more Americans live with an illness caused by smoking,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement. ""We cannot afford to continue watching the human and economic toll from tobacco rob our communities of parents and grandparents, aunts and uncles, friends and co-workers. We are committed to doing everything we can to help smokers quit and prevent young people from starting in the first place."" The ads are the brainchild of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health. The agency says smoking remains the country's leading cause of disease and preventable death, resulting in more than 443,000 fatalities annually. More than 8 million Americans live with a smoking-related illness or conditions, according to the disease agency. The combination of public service announcements and paid advertising for television, radio, newspapers and magazines also spotlights the dangers of exposure to secondhand smoke. The ads will also be featured on billboards, in theaters and online -- including on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. ""Although they may be tough to watch, the ads show real people living with real, painful consequences from smoking,"" said CDC Director Thomas R. Frieden. ""There is sound evidence that supports the use of these types of hard-hitting images and messages to encourage smokers to quit, to keep children from ever beginning to smoke, and to drastically reduce the harm caused by tobacco."" See the CDC anti-smoking campaign print ad (PDF) The campaign includes eight television ads (one of them in Spanish), seven radio spots in 30- and 60-second versions, seven print ads and five billboard and bus stop ads. The campaign marks the first time the CDC has run a paid, comprehensive national anti-tobacco advertising effort. The primary target is smokers ages 18 to 54, but public health experts also said they hope it will dissuade children from adopting the habit. Last week the surgeon general released a report on youth smoking, leading Sebelius to declare: ""Targeted marketing encourages more young people to take up this deadly addiction every day. This administration is committed to doing everything we can to prevent our children from using tobacco."" The agency said, ""Targeted messages and images that portray smoking as an acceptable, appealing activity for young people are widespread, and advertising for tobacco products is prominent in retail stores and online."" The need for such a campaign is urgent, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. ""This media campaign is a smart investment that will reduce tobacco use, save lives and reduce tobacco-related health care costs,"" Matthew L. Myers, president of the advocacy group. ""The tobacco industry spends more than $1 million every hour on marketing that entices kids, discourages smokers from quitting and portrays its deadly and addictive products as normal and appealing. The CDC's campaign will counter the industry's marketing with the harsh truth about tobacco use, told by former smokers themselves."" The CDC said the tobacco industry spends more than $27 million a day on marketing to kids and others -- about $10 billion a year. In two days, the industry spends about what the government has budgeted for the entire 12-week campaign. The industry denies that it markets to children. Tobacco giant Phillip Morris would not comment of the campaign, telling CNN: ""Philip Morris USA agrees smoking is addictive and causes serious disease. While we are not prepared to comment on CDC's anti-smoking campaign, preventing underage tobacco use, discouraging smoking initiation and promoting quitting remain important to reducing the harm from cigarette smoking. A complementary strategy, focused on the development of and appropriate communications about potentially lower risk tobacco products, may be one of the most meaningful actions that the Food and Drug Administration can take to reduce the health effects of smoking."" Not in dispute is the deadly impact smoking can have on health. About a third of the smoking-related deaths in the United States are linked to heart disease, according to the American Heart Association. ""The ads highlight a shocking but very realistic fate that could await some current smokers if they continue their tobacco addiction,"" said Nancy Brown, the association's CEO. The ads note that smoking contributes to one in five strokes and increase the odds of having a heart attack. ""The American Heart Association believes these graphic ads, coupled with vigorous tobacco control at the state level, will reach not only the adults who smoke, but also will break through to teens and discourage them from ever taking up this deadly habit,"" she said. The American Cancer Society says nine of 10 smokers started before they turned 18. ""Combating tobacco use requires a multipronged approach, including federal regulation of tobacco products, increased tobacco taxes, smoke-free workplaces and sustained investment in prevention and cessation now and beyond the end of the CDC campaign,"" said Christopher W. Hansen, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, in a statement. ""This historic advertising campaign will help to combat Big Tobacco's unscrupulous efforts to addict new users and prevent existing users from trying to quit."" Featured reader comments: Should smokers be targeted? The campaign begins less than a month after a federal mandate requiring tobacco companies to place graphic images on their products warning of the dangers of smoking was tossed out by a judge in Washington, who said the requirements were a violation of free speech. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act passed in 2009 would have required nine written warnings such as ""Cigarettes are addictive"" and ""Tobacco smoke causes harm to children."" Also included would have been alternating images of a corpse and smoke-infected lungs.

"London (CNN) -- Is a third term of Angela Merkel as German chancellor good for Europe? Angela Merkel has emerged from the weekend's elections with the Christian Democratic Union's biggest vote for 20 years. She now has a strong mandate to form a government in which she would serve as chancellor. The CDU is now likely to negotiate a ""grand coalition"" with the Social Democratic Party after the pro-business Free Democrats, Merkel's previous coalition partner, failed to pass the 5% threshold for getting into parliament. Merkel's return gives the country consistent leadership during a time in which the future of the euro has come under question, amid the economic problems of its laggard members. While Germany has emerged from the crisis with its economy relatively intact, nations such as Greece have entered deep recessions while unemployment has soared. READ MORE: Europe's Mrs Nein . In this context, a healthy Germany is regarded as a help rather than hindrance for Europe. The markets welcomed Merkel's re-election and the expectation it will provide a steady approach to the financial crisis. Europe has begun to show signs of recovery, and disruption would not be welcome. But Merkel does face challenges. A grand coalition will require her to make concessions that may impact her plans. In 2005 it took almost a month to negotiate a coalition -- so there could be weeks of uncertainty in European markets before the government is actually formed. Will there be more bailouts under a Merkel coalition? Germany and Greece have both acknowledged the latter will require further financial assistance. The IMF-led bailout for Greece is due to expire next year, leaving the nation with a financial shortfall of around 14 billion euros. Greece, which has already received two bailouts, may find itself facing more conditions as it seeks a third round of aid from its European peers. Portugal, which has been bailed out once, is expected to face problems if it attempts to return to the bond markets. As a result, bailouts and haircuts are likely to remain on the agenda for Merkel's third term even as the eurozone enters a recovery phase. IN PHOTOS: Rising to the top . The nascent pan-eurozone banking union and other pillars of Europe's rescue package -- like the legal use of the ECB's pledge to support ailing nations through ""outright monetary transactions"" -- are other issues that will need to be settled. Merkel's strengthened mandate could also mean a stronger position on fiscal restraint and austerity across Europe. Merkel is convinced, in the longer term, healthier balance sheets will leave the region better off -- but in the short term it may mean more cuts. What about the euroskeptics vote? Germany's euroskeptic party Alternative for Germany -- which is opposed to the single currency and wants the country to exit the eurozone -- did not get past the 5% threshold required to usher it into the Bundestag, or lower house of Germany's parliament. It did, however, gain 4.5% of the vote. So, while major anti-euro policy plays are out, noise will increase around Germany's role in Europe, and any benefits it gets from being in the single currency. How will a third term of Merkel influence the German economy? Merkel's stewardship of the German economy has been good for the country, but not for all of its citizens. Since she was first elected in 2005, Merkel has steered a steady course, shielding German output from the worst of the financial crisis. This is reflected in upbeat readings for business confidence and a 75% appreciation for the Xetra Dax, the nation's main bluechip stock index. While unemployment soared in the eurozone and in the U.S. after 2008, Germany's jobless tally decreased. READ MORE: How Merkel become more American . Economists have also argued Germany's exports benefit greatly from being priced in a currency that is much weaker than the Deutsche Mark would otherwise have been. However, large numbers of people are reliant on low-paid ""mini-jobs"" which leave them struggling to make ends meet. The Social Democrats are calling for a national minimum wage to combat the problem of the ""working poor."" The OECD warned recently that the gap between rich and poor in Germany was wider than in any of the group's member states, which include the U.S. and Mexico. How did Merkel survive while the rest fell? As only the third person in post-war times to win three terms in office -- joining Helmut Kohl and Konrad Adenauer -- Merkel has cemented her place in the history books. She is now positioned to topple Margaret Thatcher from the top spot as most powerful female politician of all time. Her style has been bred from her upbringing under communist rule in East Germany. The ever-present secret police -- the Stasi -- taught her the importance of discretion and knowing when to speak up or not. Her background in the sciences fed her analytical mind, and she is methodical and logical in solving problems. READ MORE: Is Germany playing beggar-my neighbor? There are no frivolities or bouts of superfluous charisma for ""Mutti"" or ""Mummy"" Merkel, as she is called in Germany. Merkel has risen to the top quietly, almost modestly. It has made her one of the most popular -- if plain -- politicians Germany has known since WW II. Merkel has been careful to keep her famously steely resolve and intransigence for Brussels, to defend Germany's interests. And for this she has been rewarded. As the eurozone's existential crisis claimed the scalps of the region's more boisterous leaders, like France's Nicolas Sarkozy, Italy's Silvio Berlusconi and Spain's Jose Rodriguez Zapatero, the queen of consistency outrode them all.","Angela Merkel has made big gains in Germany's election, and has a mandate to form a government .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal failed to clinch the year-end No. 1 ranking for the third time in his career after suffering a shock defeat at the Paris Masters on Saturday. The form player of the men's tennis season after coming back from long-term knee problems, Nadal could have added to his 2008 and 2010 feats by beating David Ferrer and reaching the final of the penultimate tournament on the calendar. However, he lost 6-3 7-5 to his third-ranked compatriot, who will defend his title in Sunday's final against Novak Djokovic. The Serbian earlier kept alive his hopes of being year-end No. 1 for the third successive year by beating 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer in Saturday's opening semifinal. ""I played maybe my best match this season,"" Ferrer said after ending a nine-match losing run to Nadal. ""Paris is very special for me. I made my first final of a grand slam in Roland Garros; last year I won my first Masters 1000 title; now I'm in the final again in Paris."" Second-ranked Djokovic had to come from behind to win 4-6 6-3 6-2 against the veteran Swiss, who is showing signs of improved form. Both matches were dress rehearsals for the ATP World Tour Finals in London next week, where Nadal and Ferrer will be in Group A along with Tomas Berdych and debutant Stanislas Wawrinka. Defending champion Djokovic and six-time winner Federer will be in Group B with Juan Martin del Potro and Richard Gasquet. ""I was pretty happy with my level of play,"" said Federer, who will equal Ivan Lendl's record 12 consecutive appearances at the season-ending event. ""I wish I could have kept it up for a bit longer and put him under pressure, but Novak battled well to stay in the match in the second set and the third set. ""I had my chances in the second and third sets. Disappointed right now, but overall it was a good week for me."" On Friday, Federer avenged his Swiss Indoors final defeat by Del Potro -- and the Argentine's week got even worse when he was robbed at Paris' Gare du Nord train station en route to Britain. His confidence will be shaken after losing his most prized possession -- a rosary that was blessed by the Pope in Rome this year, which was in a briefcase stolen as he checked in. ""My Rosary blessed by Pope Francis, I carried it everywhere,"" the 25-year-old told the ATP Tour website. ""That's what matters most to me. I was finishing the check-in and was asked for an autograph. I turned around to sign it and, within 20 seconds, it was stolen."" Meanwhile, the Italian women's team took a big step towards a fourth Fed Cup title after winning both singles matches on the opening day of the final against an under-strength Russia Saturday. Italy, whose last title came in 2010, saw its top-ranked player Sara Errani thrash Irina Khromacheva 6-1 6-4 after Roberta Vinci battled to a 5-7 7-5 8-6 win against Alexandra Panova. Both Russians were making their debut in the largest team tournament in women's international sport, which featured 97 nations this year, as the country's top 11 players were unavailable. The final clashes with the WTA Tour's Tournament of Champions in Bulgaria, a second-tier end-of-season event where Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenckova lost to Sam Stosur in Saturday's semis and Romania's Simona Halep beat Serbian Ana Ivanovic. The International Tennis Federation, which plans to move the Fed Cup final back a week next season, announced Saturday that Tunisia will be banned from the men's 2014 Davis Cup tournament after refusing to allow one of its players to compete against an Israeli. Malek Jaziri had been due to play Amir Weintraub at last month's Tashkent Challenger. ""There is no room for prejudice of any kind in sport or in society,"" ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti said. ""The ITF board decided to send a strong message to the Tunisian Tennis Federation that this kind of action will not be tolerated by any of our members. ""The board felt that suspension from Davis Cup, a competition that was founded 113 years ago to encourage better understanding through sport, would provide a good lesson for the federation and a fitting penalty for their unfortunate action.""","World No. 2 Novak Djokovic will play David Ferrer in Sunday's Paris Masters final .

"(CNN) -- Substance abuse, addiction and its consequences cost U.S. governmental bodies nearly $500 billion in 2005 with only a fraction of state and federal dollars spent on prevention and treatment, according to a report released Thursday. A report suggests a small amount of state and federal . funds is spent on drug prevention and treatment. Of the $373.9 billion spent by federal and state governments, some 95.6 percent was spent to ""shovel up the consequences and human wreckage of substance abuse and addiction,"" while only 1.9 percent was spent on prevention and treatment, 1.4 percent on taxation and regulation, and less than 1 percent on research and interdiction, says the report from Columbia University's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. In fact, for every dollar spent to prevent and treat substance abuse, federal and state governments spent more than $50 on public programs aimed at addressing its effects, the report says. Spending breakdowns for local governments were not available because of data limitations, the report says. ""Despite a significant and growing body of knowledge documenting that addiction is a preventable, treatable and manageable disease, and despite the proven efficacy of prevention and treatment techniques, our nation still looks the other way while substance abuse and addiction cause illness, injury, death and crime, savage our children, overwhelm social service systems, impede education -- and slap a heavy and growing tax on our citizens,"" Susan Foster, the addiction center's vice president and director of policy research and analysis, said in a written statement. The center found that federal, state and local governments spent some $467.7 billion on substance abuse-related costs, including health care, justice systems and family court, child welfare and homelessness. The figures are for 2005, the most recent year for which data was available over the course of the study, the center said. The report, ""Shoveling Up II: The Impact of Substance Abuse on Federal, State and Local Budgets,"" resulted from three years of research and analysis, according to the addiction center. The vast majority of state and federal spending, 71.1 percent, was spent on health care and the justice system, the report says. ""Increasing costs in these areas are devastating state budgets, while health care costs are consuming a larger and larger share of federal spending."" The center found that if substance abuse and addiction were its own category within the federal budget, it would rank sixth in size behind Social Security, national defense, Medicare and two other programs, consuming 9.6 percent of the entire budget. For states, 15.7 percent of budgets were spent on substance abuse, which is up from 13.3 percent in the 1998 ""Shoveling Up"" report, which examined only state spending. If substance abuse were a state budget category, it would rank No. 2, behind elementary and secondary education, the report says. ""States spend more on substance abuse and addiction than they spend on Medicaid, higher education, transportation or justice,"" it says. For every $100 state governments spent on substance abuse, they spent an average of $2.38 on prevention, treatment and research, the study found. Connecticut spent the most, with $10.39; New Hampshire the least, with 22 cents. In every case, the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse said, it made the most conservative assumptions. And it couldn't even figure in some costs -- higher education, tobacco and drug-related developmental disabilities and highway accidents linked to illicit or controlled prescription drug use, among others -- because of data limitations, so the actual amounts spent are likely even higher. The report advocates that more funding and efforts be directed toward prevention and treatment, rather than cleaning up the wreckage that substance abuse leaves in its wake. ""Under any circumstances, spending more than 95 percent of taxpayer dollars on the crime, health care costs, child abuse, domestic violence, homelessness and other consequences of tobacco, alcohol and illegal and prescription drug abuse and addiction, and only 2 percent to relieve individuals and taxpayers of these burdens, is a reckless misallocation of public funds,"" Joseph Califano Jr., a former U.S. secretary of health, education and welfare who founded the addiction center and serves as its chairman, said in the statement. ""In these economic times, such upside-down-cake public policy is unconscionable. It's past time for this fiscal and human waste to end."" The report calls for a sharper focus on prevention, especially aimed at children. It points to the success of the American Legacy Foundation's ""Truth"" campaign on youth smoking, and says similar campaigns are needed to target drug abuse and underage drinking. Merely blaming those who made the choice to begin using alcohol or drugs or to start smoking does not work, the report points out. ""When use of these substances progresses to the point of meeting medical criteria for abuse or addiction, changes have occurred in the brain which make cessation of use extraordinarily difficult. ... The bottom line is that while an individual is responsible for his or her actions related to the disease, the disease must be treated."" But perhaps one of the most important recommendations in the report is this: America needs to shift its culture and attempt to dispel stigmas surrounding substance abuse. The center points to a similar shift that occurred regarding the AIDS virus: ""In a matter of a few years, AIDS went from being seen as a social curse to being recognized as a serious, treatable disease. It's time for the public health community to mount a similar effort with respect to alcohol and other drug abuse and addiction, to move the nation from stigmatizing it to recognizing it as a disease.""","Nearly $468 billion was spent in 2005 on substance abuse, addiction, report says .

"(CNN) -- James Makawa wants Africa to be seen by the rest of the world in the best possible light. That's why the broadcaster and co-founder of The African Channel aims to create the first high-definition programs from Africa for global consumption. But while the 49-year-old Zimbabwean works out that project, it is The Africa Channel that he hopes will continue to draw attention to the best of the continent's culture and diversity. ""[Until The Africa Channel] nobody had the audacity to basically say, 'I am going to grab a hold of this continent, put a nice bow around it and change the perception of this beloved continent in a classy, classy way,'"" Makawa told CNN. Since 2005, The Africa Channel has been bringing positive stories from the continent to millions of channel subscribers in the U.S., the UK and Caribbean. Makawa is no longer in charge of the channel but remains an active shareholder. Born in Zimbabwe in 1960 when it was under British rule as Rhodesia, he left to study in America when he was 17-years-old as the country was being torn apart by civil war. While leaving his parents and home was a difficult experience, his world was turned upside down when studying broadcast journalism. ""The idea that I could even be on radio or TV and impart information and tell a story. My goodness, talk about Pandora's Box just opening up! "" Makawa went on to work as a journalist in the U.S. for NBC and later was involved in distributing American TV shows to Africa. It was during this time that he discovered the diversity of stories in Africa that were not being told. The plan for The Africa Channel was thrashed out in 2002 over coffee with two colleagues. Fueled by enthusiasm for their idea they were able to attract investment and spread their optimism. One of the first backers was Congolese basketball player Dikembe Mutombo. ""For me it was something that I believed in, and I was proud. To see a channel carrying the name of my continent and people wonder why you love Africa so much. I say this is where I was born and raised. My roots are in Africa. That's where I developed. My personality that I carry today came from home,"" Mutombo told CNN. The Africa Channel showcases English-language programs from across the continent, but Makawa appeared on the channel himself, most notably in 2007 interviewing Robert Mugabe. ""One thing I learned from the process was this is one man who has been on one hell of a journey. He's smart. A true intellectual. But I just felt after speaking with him that one time that so much had changed in not just the world but the continent and the country itself,"" said Makawa. From world leaders to the lifestyles and culture of the continent, Makawa is committed to promoting the continent as much as possible. ""We all know Africa is the cradle of mankind. This is a vibrant, vibrant place. It has its problems, it has its challenges just like any other place on the planet. Some more complex. But this is a place that is just so rich, vibrant, promising.""","U.S.-based Zimbabwean broadcaster is co-founder of The Africa Channel .

"Washington (CNN) -- When Genevieve Jeuck and Michael Sallemi came up with their romantic little idea, it seemed perfect. They would get married in early October on the rim of the Grand Canyon, just as the cooling winds of autumn were starting to blow. With family and friends standing by, they would pledge their love to each other. Cue the rainbow, and the cry of the circling eagle. Then their uncle showed up. Uncle Sam. And everything went to hell. ""Well, I've been going through a lot of emotions,"" Genevieve said after the government shutdown put the canyon off limits, and their plans on ice. ""I cried. I was freaking out. I had to make all new plans."" She is not alone. About two dozen couples planned to tie the knot in National Parks over the next few days, and now they can't even pitch a pup tent. ""We've been joking,"" Genevieve says, ""that the government is going to put a tarp over (the canyon) so we can't see it."" Party politics fuel shutdown blame game . Stubborn Republicans or dogmatic Democrats . Listen to Democrats, and the government shutdown is a tale of recklessly stubborn Republicans driving the country into a chasm. Listen to Republicans, and it's a story of cleverly dogmatic Democrats who would rather see calamity than make a deal. But listen to many voters and you'll hear a question: How is it possible that both parties have failed so badly in the relatively simple task of keeping the federal government open for business? ""If I don't perform at my job, then I don't get paid,"" Michael, the canyon-stranded groom says. ""That should hold true for other people."" It is simple to measure the impact of the shutdown in numbers: more than 843,000 employees may be told to pack up their staplers and go home until they are called back; a billion dollars a week could be falling out of the economy as a result of the cut in federal spending. Business lost, research halted: Impacts of the shutdown . An emotional rollercoaster . It is also easy to understand why furloughed federal workers are angry. After all, one of the perks of government employment has traditionally been stability. Not so much anymore. Along the National Mall, a woman leaving her government office for what, at the moment, is an undetermined period of time looked disgusted. ""We've been on an emotional rollercoaster for a while."" Defense worker Rob Merritt has already taken a hit to his income this year from the forced budget cuts, and he is struggling with unexpected medical bills. While he waits to see how long and severe the shutdown is, he fears for his family of six. ""If we were to go into a moderate government shutdown, I'd probably have to file for bankruptcy."" ""Federal workers have nothing to do with bringing about the government shutdown,"" says William Dougan. He's the head of the National Federation of Federal Employees and adds, ""but they are the ones who are going to feel the impact of it the greatest."" But frustration is echoing among many other Americans, too; from cities, to the countryside, to the valleys of all those empty national parks. Ridiculous closures . Part of it is the sheer ridiculousness of what has been caught in the financial and political vise. At the National Zoo, there will be no more ""panda cam"" for those keeping track of those little black and white balls of fur. Also, in case you're counting, no tiger, orangutan, or clawed otter cams. In orbit, American astronauts will apparently be just fine on the International Space Station, but we won't be able to spy on them through NASA TV. It also appeared for a while that no one would be watching for asteroids hurtling toward the earth, then the space agency tweeted ""To clarify: Many observatories...are watching the sky."" That did not stop the galactic snarkiness from Benjamin Barnes, who tweeted right back, ""But we're all still gonna die, right?"" And on the football field, Air Force may not play Navy this weekend as scheduled. Apparently the cost of travel is an issue, although perhaps they no longer have a coin to toss for the kickoff either. Boehner learned hard lesson in failed House coup . Blocking vets . Within a short walk of both the Capitol and the White House, one scene captivated what is clearly maddening about the situation for all sorts of people. A group of veterans from Mississippi, many in wheelchairs, came to Washington to see the World War II Memorial, only to find the open-air site fenced off. After some consternation, the fences were pushed aside. A bagpiper played, the vets went in, and guards just looked on while members of Congress on hand railed about the stupidity of the whole scene. Democratic Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa: ""I don't get it. I'm furious."" Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert from Texas: ""We've got park service employees out here. Why wouldn't you have them here to allow the veterans in, instead of stand and keep them from coming in?"" Shutdown: Obama blames GOP 'ideological crusade' Who's at fault? To be sure, there is enough blame out there to choke a horse. Polls show the Republicans taking the worst of it, but Democrats and President Obama are also being hammered for their part in the debacle. By late afternoon, the growing tide of unrest seemed to be having some effect. Republican Congressman Scott Rigell from Virginia, while still opposing Obamacare, was telling CNN's Dana Bash he'd like to see a deal to make it all stop. ""Now we're at a point...what are we fighting for? I don't think the continued shutdown helps our conservative agenda."" Indeed, few are arguing that this leap into the economic abyss will help anyone, except voters who might yet want more reasons to think badly of the whole D.C. crowd.","The government shutdown is already having real-world consequences .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- A retired French electrician who revealed that he has 271 previously unknown works by artist Pablo Picasso did not steal them, his lawyer told CNN Tuesday. ""He kept them with love,"" Evelyne Rees said. Pierre Le Guennec, 71, worked for Picasso for three years, until the artist died in 1973, and continued to work for his widow, Jacqueline, until she died 13 years later, Rees said. The electrician asked Jacqueline for pieces of Picasso's work, and she gave them to Le Guennec over a period of time, his lawyer said. Le Guennec contacted the Picasso estate by mail in January to request certification of authenticity for the works: a collection of cubist collages, drawings, lithographs, notebooks and a watercolor. Along with the letter, Le Guennec included 26 photographs of previously unpublished Picasso pieces. But he found himself slapped with a lawsuit filed by the artist's son, Claude Picasso, and five other heirs who say the works are stolen. The lawsuit was first reported Monday by the French newspaper Liberation. His approach to the Picasso family shows that he is innocent, his lawyer said. ""If you are a thief, you would not put yourself in the mouth of the wolf,"" she said. Rees said that Le Guennec contacted the Picasso Administration to get an idea of what the pieces were worth. She said the pieces had ""sentimental"" value to Le Guennec, and he did not make their presence public because he was not looking for money. He brought all 271 pieces from his home in the south of France to the offices of the Picasso Administration in Paris. Christine Pinault, Claude Picasso's assistant and an employee of the Picasso Administration, said the artwork was reviewed by the family and others in the administration, who determined that the works are all authentic. The family's lawsuit, filed September 23, charges that Le Guennec hid stolen goods. France's Central Office for the Fight Against Traffic in Cultural Goods seized the pieces from Le Guennec's home on the French Riviera on October 5 and is holding them in a vault at its Nanterre office, northwest of Paris. Pinault said that one of the reasons the Picasso family is taking Le Guennec to court is because he hasn't adequately explained how he came across the works. Jean Jacques Neuer, a lawyer for the Picasso family, said he couldn't believe Le Guennec's story, not least since the collection includes nine significant works. ""It's impossible to think that [Picasso] would have given nine works to an electrician,"" Neuer said Tuesday. ""It's impossible that these works have been given away"" to Le Guennec. The works are from a period spanning 1900 to 1932, according to Liberation. CNN's Winnie Andrews and Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Impossible"" to think Picasso gave works away, a family representative says .

"(CNN) -- Two people were killed over the weekend when they were exposed to toxic gases on the ship once used for the ABC television series ""The Love Boat,"" according to the company that recently bought the vessel. The ship, which had just completed its final voyage and was scheduled to be dismantled, was damaged while entering the port of Aliaga in Turkey's Izmir province and began taking on water in a storage area under the main engine. Crews on Saturday began work to drain the water, deploying electrical pumps. Engine-exhaust buildup led to the toxic exposure, according to Izmir Ship Recycling Co., the firm that recently purchased the ship for 2.5 million euros (about $3.33 million). Six other people were injured and were released from the hospital after receiving treatment, according to Izmir Ship Recycling. The Aliaga attorney general's office has launched an investigation, but investigators haven't been able to reach the accident site. Izmir Ship Recycling has to finish removing water and turn the ship off its side so authorities can continue the probe. The boat's original name was Pacific Princess. It is 171 meters (about 560 feet) long and 24 meters (about 78 feet) wide. The ship was used in the ABC series between 1977 and 1987. Once retired from the series, the vessel was renamed Pacific and was used for Mediterranean Sea tours. Dismantling of the ship is expected to take between seven and eight months.","Two people reportedly die from exposure to toxic gas on ship featured on ""Love Boat""

"New York (CNN) -- A Manhattan grand jury is investigating the beating death of a man in New York's Union Square as a possible hate crime, New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner John McCarthy told CNN Tuesday. Jeffrey Babbitt, 62, was pronounced dead Monday, five days after being beaten by a man who allegedly said, ""I'm gonna punch out the first white guy I see,"" according to police commissioner Ray Kelly. Witnesses said the suspect, identified by police as Martin Redrick, 40, struck Babbitt so hard that bystanders could hear the force of his head hitting the cement. Two other men were also assaulted in the September 4 attack as they tried to help Babbitt, police said. Redrick, who police say uses several aliases, including Lashawn Marten, has been charged with three counts of assault -- one of them a felony. He made an appearance in court Tuesday and was appointed a new lawyer. Attorney Michael Croce was not in court Tuesday and hasn't yet met his client. He told CNN Redrick has not had a psychiatric evaluation and has not been asked to undergo such an examination. ""I'm not aware of any reason why he should receive one, but I've not ruled anything out,"" Croce said. No additional charges were filed, but the grand jury is considering evidence being gathered by the NYPD's hate crimes task force and may decide to upgrade the charge to a hate crime, which could include manslaughter. ""The murder or manslaughter charge is a charge that requires far more on the part of the prosecution to prove his intent to inflict that type of injury,"" Redrick's attorney said. ""They must show intent to cause serious injury.... It needs to be explored more as to whether they have enough evidence to prove intent to kill based on one punch."" Redrick was paroled from state prison in 2001 after a 1998 attempted assault conviction for throwing a glass bottle that hit someone in the head, according New York's Department of Corrections spokeswoman Linda Foglia. Redrick has been arrested and charged with aggravated harassment, assault, trespass and drug possession, a law enforcement source told CNN, but the outcomes of those cases were unclear. Robert Pizzimenti, a neighbor of Babbitt's, described the man as ""a lovable guy."" ""He was the kind of guy who always was doing favors for people.

"(CNN) -- When President Barack Obama said this weekend that bombing Syrian targets is the right thing to do, and then asked Congress to approve it, the international crisis took a turn toward a fierce domestic battle. There are so many moving parts to this complicated story that it can become quite difficult to keep up. Let this Q&A bring you up to speed on the dizzying developments. Is the U.S. going to war with Syria? No -- at least not yet. Even though Obama said he wants to strike Syrian targets after the regime allegedly used chemical weapons on a rebel stronghold last month, he says he wants to wait for Congress' blessing first. When will Congress decide? Not anytime soon. Lawmakers won't be back in Washington until September 9. But the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says it'll hold a hearing on Syria this Tuesday. Can't lawmakers be called in earlier? They can, for an emergency debate. But Obama said he won't ask for that. Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, says it's fine to wait. According to officials, Dempsey told the president a delay won't jeopardize a military strike. Will Congress support Obama? Obama might be able to count on the Senate, where the Democrats hold a slim majority. The question is, will the Republican-dominated House go along? Lawmakers agree that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons is a travesty. But they also don't want a repeat of Iraq. Where exactly does the hesitation lie? Some, like Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, say the U.S. should act only if there's a clear threat to its national security. Others, like Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, say airstrikes won't go far enough. They want al-Assad removed from power. Does Obama really have to wait for Congress' green light? Technically, no. The 1973 War Powers Act allows the president to launch military action, but he must notify Congress within 48 hours. But just because he can doesn't mean he will. ""While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,"" he said Saturday. ""We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual."" But didn't he order airstrikes in Libya in 2011 without congressional approval? How is Syria different? In Libya, the U.S. was backing NATO action. In Syria's case, there's been no U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an intervention. If the U.S. goes in, it would be going in unilaterally. What's the U.N. saying? U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says he'll go before the Security Council after a team of U.N. inspectors -- who've been on the ground investigating the alleged attack -- presents its report. But it could take the team up to three weeks to analyze the evidence. And even then, it'll only say if there was a chemical attack, not who was behind it. So would the U.S. really have no foreign support? British Prime Minister David Cameron called for military action against Syria -- only to have his hopes quashed when lawmakers narrowly voted it down. French ministers will meet Monday to discuss Syria, and hold a debate two days later. ""France cannot act alone,"" its interior minister said Sunday. ""We need a coalition."" German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the time gained waiting for U.S. congressional approval ""must be used to reach a common position of the international community within the U.N. Security Council."" In another tweet, he said that the results from the U.N. inspectors' visit to Syria ""must be sped up."" How do Americans feel? A poll released last week showed almost 80% of Americans think Obama should get congressional approval first. And after his announcement Saturday, anti-war protests sprouted up across the country -- including one in Los Angeles that drew hundreds. And what about Syria. How does it feel about all of this? The Syrian government has said it didn't use chemical weapons in the August 21 attack. It says jihadists fighting alongside Syrian rebels used them to turn global sentiment against the regime. Syria's prime minister says the country's army is on ""maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges."" What about the Syrian opposition? A major Syrian opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, said it was disappointed by Obama wanting Congress' permission. ""We can't understand how you can promise to help those who are being slaughtered every day in the hundreds, giving them false hope, then change your mind and say 'Let's wait and see,'"" the group told CNN. And the Local Coordination Committees in Syria, another opposition group, lamented the notion that a U.S. strike would be limited. ""A limited strike to merely warn Assad today will lead to nothing but his increase in violence, as well as to his complete confidence that no one would prevent him from killing,"" the group said in a statement. ""In the end, no one will pay the price but the Syrian people."" How exactly would U.S. carry out an attack? No one is calling for boots on the ground. Five U.S. warships with Tomahawk cruise missiles are waiting in the Mediterranean Sea. The Tomahawk has a range of about 1,000 miles. It can loiter over targets, circling for hours, and can be reprogrammed midflight to change course. Yes, each costs about $1.2 million, but they can be fired from quite a distance. This means no one has to get within range of Syrian fire. Could Syria strike back? Syria has some anti-ship missiles -- but they have a range of only 62 to 186 miles, says Edward Hunt, a senior analyst at IHS Jane's. It also has a number of Scuds and similar surface-to-surface weapons, but these are not designed to be used against moving targets such as U.S. warships, Hunt said. How are the neighbors reacting? Security is tight in Lebanon, where one in six is now a Syrian refugee. In Israel, there's been a rush on gas masks because residents fear that Syria could target Israel for retaliation. And Jordan, a key Western ally, says it won't be a launchpad for a strike. This is all a lot to digest. Give me the takeaway. A U.S. strike against Syria is not imminent. And even though Obama can launch a military attack unilaterally, he'd prefer to have Congress' approval first.

Shoichet, and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","Congress won't be back until September 9 .

"(CNN) -- The boyfriend convicted of strangling and drowning a famed swimsuit designer in a bathtub at a chic New York hotel was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, the maximum sentence for second-degree murder, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said Monday. A jury convicted 27-year-old Nicholas Brooks, son of ""You Light Up My Life"" composer Joseph Brooks, in New York Supreme Court in July for the murder of his girlfriend, Sylvie Cachay. ""We have come a long way in our recognition and understanding of domestic violence, but there is much more we have to do to better protect individuals like Ms. Cachay,"" District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in a statement Monday. Cachay's bruised body was found submerged in water in an overflowing bathtub at the Soho House New York club and hotel on December 9, 2010, police said. A guest staying on a lower floor reported to hotel management that water was leaking through the ceiling, according to court documents. A hotel employee investigating the source of the leak entered Cachay's room and discovered her body, the documents say. Brooks' attorney, Jeffrey Hoffman, said Monday he and his client plan to appeal. ""We expect to have a successful appeal and be back in court as a result of that,"" Hoffman told CNN. Authorities said they relied on interviews with hotel employees and surveillance videos from the location to charge Brooks. Cachay's body had bruising on the neck and bite marks when she was discovered, police said. An autopsy indicated the designer suffered injuries consistent with neck compression, court records show. Cachay had internal hemorrhaging, injuries to her scalp and cuts to her lips and mouth, the documents say. ""Sylvie Cachay was one of those rare individuals who truly sparkled when she spoke,"" publicist Kate Godici said about Cachay in July when Brooks was convicted. ""She will be deeply and painfully missed, yet celebrated, honored and never forgotten."" After heading the swimwear team at Victoria's Secret, Cachay debuted her own luxury line of swimwear in 2006 to rave reviews. The collection became a celebrity favorite. Brooks' father, Joseph Brooks, 73, committed suicide in May 2011, New York police said. The Oscar-winning songwriter was facing 11 rape and sexual assault charges, New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told CNN. Nicholas Brooks will be up for parole in 25 years.","In July, a jury convicted Nicholas Brooks for the second-degree murder of Sylvie Cachay .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese police say the late aunt of a young boy whose eyes were gouged out is the prime suspect in the horrific attack, state media news agency Xinhua reports. The six-year-old boy, named by local media as Xiao Binbin, is still recovering in hospital after being found bloodied and in a drugged state with both eyes missing near his home in late August. He'd been missing for four hours. Early reports suggested that Xiao may have been the victim of organ traffickers, claims police later denied. Now, authorities in Fenxi country, Shanxi Province, have named the suspect as the boy's aunt Zhang Huiying, who killed herself last Friday after jumping into a well in the courtyard of her home. Police said Zhang's DNA was found at the scene of her nephew's attack. Blood stains belonging to the boy were also found on Zhang's clothes. The boy told police that a woman with a non-local accent called his name and asked him if anybody in his home played mahjong before taking him to the field, according to quotes attributed to his mother, Wang Wenli, in state media. Local police immediately launched a manhunt for the suspect by offering a 100,000 yuan ($16,335) reward for information leading to the arrest of the suspect, whom they said was a woman, according to Xinhua. Soon after the attack, state broadcaster CCTV showed images of a boy with bandages over his eyes recovering in hospital while his stricken relatives cried at his bedside.","Chinese police name suspect as boy's aunt Zhang Huiying .

"(CNN) -- A Boston-area man who plotted to kidnap children, rape and eat them, was sentenced Tuesday to more than 26 years in prison followed by a lifetime of supervised release, according to court documents from the United States district attorney's office. Geoffrey Portway, 40, was also ordered to pay $3,000 in restitution to five children whose images were found in online chats by Portway, according to court documents. Portway, a citizen of the United Kingdom and most recently of Worcester, Massachusetts, also faces deportation following his release from prison, according to court documents. According to defense attorney Richard Sweeney, Portway's sentencing is in accordance with a plea agreement he signed in May, during which he pleaded guilty to distribution and possession of child pornography and solicitation to commit a crime of violence. Sweeney declined additional comment Tuesday on his client's sentence of 320 months, or 26 years and eight months, in prison. Portway went by the moniker ""Fat Longpig"" during his online chats, according to court documents. Ex-PTA president accused of making child porn at elementary school . It was these chats -- which included discussions about abducting, raping, murdering and eating children, according to court documents -- that put Portway on the radar screen of police. His home in Worcester was searched last year and authorities found tens of thousands of computer images and videos of child pornography, 4,500 exchanges of child pornography between Portway and the people he chatted with online. The images included children purportedly being cooked and prepared to be eaten, court documents said. Authorities also found a locked basement, court documents show. Photos taken the day of Portway's arrest show a narrow wooden staircase leading downstairs to a soundproof room in which he planned to imprison children. The room was furnished with a metal cage with a circular hole for feeding, a rusted and worn steel-topped table, as well as multiple kinds of metal bondage equipment. A child-sized coffin made of plywood was found on the floor nearby. 'Cannibal cop' convicted in New York . Also found in the house were handcuffs, rope intended for bondage, mouth gags, and castration tools. A large box of frozen raw chicken, near a handful of disposable scalpels, was photographed by investigators near two industrial-sized freezers. In the kitchen, a jug of Clorox bleach was seen by the doorway, while a red child-sized 'onesie' lay on the countertop, amid snacks and disposable syringes. A butcher kit containing plastic gloves, an apron, cutting board, bone saw, cleaver, shears, and multiple knives was photographed in the sink. Portway's collection of DVDs and books appear to echo his intentions to ensnare, rape, and cannibalize children. Among his DVD collection were titles such as ""Human Beast,"" ""Hansel and Gretel,"" ""The Real Cannibal Holocaust,"" ""The Genesis Children,"" ""Cannibal the Musical,"" and ""Cannibal Ferox,"" a film with the tagline ""Make them die slowly."" Portman's DVD copy of the film ""Albert Fish: In Sin He Found Salvation"" had a note written on it: ""Will, let's do lunch."" Online chats, seized by police, showed Portway calling his basement a ""dungeon"" where he intended to ""keep kidnapped children while he sexually abused them and as a place to eventually murder and cannibalize the children,"" authorities said. Pretzel bag leads feds to child porn suspect in California . Two other men who chatted with Portway have already been convicted. One was a puppeteer who, authorities said, plotted with Portway to kidnap children the puppeteer knew from his work at a Florida church. Last week, federal prosecutors called Portway's collection ""chilling"" and wrote in a sentencing recommendation that he should be imprisoned for at least 27 years, to protect the public. ""Portway has pled guilty to some of the most vile and heinous crimes known to our society,"" federal prosecutors wrote in court documents. Prosecutors could not be immediately reached for comment on Portway's sentencing Tuesday. Florida man linked to 1 million child porn videos, images .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Pakistan, ranked by the Pew Research Center as one of the least tolerant countries in the world for gays, has pulled the plug on its only online resource for the Muslim nation's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. Queer Pakistan, which just went online in July, confirmed it had been blocked September 24 with a Twitter post saying, ""It's official! QueerPK is banned from viewership in Pakistan."" Netizens attempting to access the site inside the country are greeted with the note, ""Surf Safely! This website is not accessible. The site you are trying to access contains content that is prohibited for viewership from within Pakistan."" Outside the country, however, Queer Pakistan can still be reached via a redirect. ""#QueerPK is now accessible on new domain name http://humjins.com! We are determined to fight #censorship if we have your support!"" said Queer Pakistan in a follow-up Twitter post. ""The government's blocking of Queerpk.com clearly violates internationally recognized rights to freedom of expression and non-discrimination, and should be lifted immediately,"" Phil Robertson, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, told CNN. Queer Pakistan's last entry on its homepage, dated September 4, detailed religious, political and social reactions to its existence -- including a call for the government ""to control them"" and a statement that the ""West should not try to impose their values on us."" ""Pakistan's shuttering of this news portal shows how incredibly out of step Pakistan is with growing efforts by the United Nations to ensure rights protections for LGBT persons, including the strong public endorsement of LGBT rights given by none other than the U.N. Secretary-General himself,"" added Robertson. ""Pakistan's donors should get off the sidelines and publicly press the government to reverse this internet censorship and permit discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity to proceed unhindered."" Homosexuality is illegal in Pakistan, a country of more than 193 million people, nearly 97% of which are Muslim. According to IRIN, a U.N. humanitarian news and analysis service, ""under section 377 of the PCC (Pakistan Penal Code), whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which [shall not be less than two years nor more than] 10 years, and shall also be liable to a fine."" Pakistan is also one of just several countries in the world that still reserve the death penalty for homosexuals, according to the International Lesbian and Gay Association, or ILGA. This past June, the Pew Research Center released the results of its survey on the ""Global Divide on Homosexuality."" Of 39 countries studied, Pakistan was found to be one of the least gay-tolerant, with 87% of those surveyed saying homosexuality should be rejected. In Asia, only Indonesia -- the world's most populous Muslim country -- scored higher with 93% disapproval. Spain and Germany were found to be the world's most- and second-most tolerant countries respectively. In a separate survey, Spartacus World's Gay Travel Index ranked Pakistan 124th of 138 nations surveyed for gay tolerance. The country received an overall score of ""-5"" for the high degree of religious influence, anti-gay laws, local hostility and the risk of prosecution. Vatican City, Egypt, and Russia scored even lower -- with Iran bottoming out the list with a score of ""-13.""","Pakistan has blocked country's first and only gay resources website .

"(CNN) -- ""Saturday Night Live"" had some fun recently at the expense of undecided voters. Bill Maher took it a step further on his HBO show ""Real Time,"" calling those who have yet to make up their minds in the presidential election ""ignorant."" The jokes may be funny, but both campaigns are taking the final phase of the election season very seriously. The stakes are high in the first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney, set for Wednesday night in Denver. As New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said so aptly over the weekend, ""This whole race is going to be turned upside down come Thursday morning."" Opinion: Obama, light a cig; Romney, throw deep . That's not just Jersey bluster. Both Obama and Romney are hoping to land a knockout punch -- a moment where they can break through for good. For viewers everywhere, expect great drama. Undecideds . The notion that the final month of the election may not matter is, well, ignorant. Presidential debates can make a difference. Opinion: Swing voters want to hear specifics . Let's look back to 2000. The final debate was ""enough to turn a neck-and-neck race into a solid lead for GOP Texas Gov. George W. Bush"" over Al Gore. What did it? ""The debate appears to have made Republicans more enthusiastic about voting while turning some Democrats away from the polls,"" according to a CNN poll at the time. Same thing in 2004. After the second presidential debate of the cycle, CNN wrote that Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry ""appears to be holding the ground he gained against President Bush after the first presidential debate."" It tightened a race that was at one point looking like a Bush runaway. (True, Bush won most of electoral votes, but the difference in popular votes was within 3 percentage points.) Maher and SNL can poke fun at the undecided voters, but these people matter -- especially in a tight race like the one between Obama and Romney -- since they make up a small but solid percentage of the electorate. The undecideds will have three more chances to make a decision, including a debate on October 16 that will be moderated by ""State of the Union"" anchor Candy Crowley. Unsatisfieds . Recently, 40% of Americans ""say they are not too or not at all satisfied, marking the lowest level of candidate satisfaction since the 1992 presidential election."" That's a lot of Americans who aren't ready to enthusiastically embrace a candidate or start convincing their friends that their choice is the right one. What about the last presidential election? In 2008, 72% of voters said they were satisfied with the choices, perhaps because both Barack Obama and Sarah Palin were dynamic. What does this mean for 2012? Namely, that a big voting bloc is waiting for the candidates to prove their worth. Opinion: Why debate is crucial for Obama, too . The unsatisfieds are voters who feel their needs are not being met by the campaign stump speeches and talking points. CNN's Halimah Abdullah took a look at these ""slivers"" of voters. Abdullah profiled a man who voted for Obama in 2008 but has grown disillusioned. This man has a specific list of items that he finds politically appealing, but neither campaign has satisfied him so far. He plans to tune in to the debates which may sway him. Late deciders . Like the unsatisfied voters, there is a group of voters who haven't started to pay attention to the race. They're not glued to the 24-hour news cycle of cable TV or the blogosphere. They're not remotely as invested as the inside-the-beltway crowd. But they do vote, and the debates are a critical last-minute stop for them. Opinion: Will candidates let returning troops fall off the fiscal cliff? In the 2004 election, which at first looked like a big Bush victory before the debates in the last month, 10% of voters said they decided in the final 30 days, and Kerry captured 54% to Bush's 44% of this group. Similarly, in the 2008 race, 15% of the voters made their decision in the last month, with more than 50% going for Obama. In 1996, Clinton received more of the last-minute deciders. Persuadables . There's one more category of people who Obama and Romney will be looking to lock up during the debates. These are the persuadable voters. They are voters who lean one way or the other but aren't sure whether they will cast a ballot. In the latest CNN poll, a large percentage of respondents fell into this category. Among Obama supporters, 26% of likely voters ""moderately"" support him while 30% of registered voters ""moderately"" support him. Among Romney supporters, 28% of likely voters ""moderately"" support him and 35% of registered voters support him. These numbers are not insignificant. In a race that involves both rallying the base and attracting independents, especially in the swing states, turning moderate support to strong support as well as registered voters to likely voters can be a key to victory. 2012 finale . Like any election, this one is defined by key moments. Certainly, Romney's victory in the primary was one. Mitt and Ann Romney's speeches at the Republican National Convention -- and, likewise, Barack and Michelle Obama's at the Democratic National Convention -- were as well. Since the conventions Democrats have gained ground and a secretly taped video of Romney's offhand comments about 47% of Americans not paying taxes has surfaced. It would be surprising if Obama doesn't allude to Romney's comment in some way, even if in passing. Opinion: Romney's best bet is to be Mr. Fix-it . On the foreign policy front, a terrorist attack in Libya on September 11 left a U.S. Ambassador dead, and questions remain glaringly unanswered regarding the Obama administration's handling of security in Libya. Romney is expected to bring up this issue. Back in late February was the ""season finale"" of the primary debates, which in retrospect seemed like the ultimate reality show with more twists and turns than a ""Real Housewives"" reunion. Now we get the season premiere of the general election debates with four highly anticipated episodes before the 2012 series finale. The comedy shows can have their fun -- but the real drama begins tonight in Denver. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Krakauer.","Wednesday night is the first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney .

"(CNN) -- Two convicted murderers who allegedly used forged documents to walk out of prison were booked Tuesday in Orange County, Florida -- the place where both men hail from and where the murders they are responsible for took place. After days on the lam, Charles Walker and Joseph Jenkins were recaptured on Saturday night at Panama City's Coconut Grove Motor Inn, some 360 miles northwest of the Orlando area. By 2:30 p.m. ET Tuesday, they were back in the Orange County jail, according to county corrections spokesman Allen Moore. ""The two will be held in maximum custody in two separate locations of the jail system,"" Allen said. Walker, who faces a new escape charge, is set to appear at 9 a.m. Wednesday in an Orlando courtroom. Jenkins does not face the same charge, and is not set to appear in court. Courts, corrections deflect blame . Walker and Jenkins, both 34, had been serving life terms without parole for unrelated killings at the Franklin Correctional Institution in North Carrabelle, south of Tallahassee in Florida's Panhandle. Jenkins walked out September 27, while Walker left October 8. Both used legal-looking documents with bogus reproductions of several key players' signatures, including those of the Orlando-area state attorney and Judge Belvin Perry, plus the seal of the Orange County clerk of court's office. State officials have been investigating that type of scam for about a year and had warned prosecutors about the schemes over the summer, said Jerry Bailey, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's commissioner. On Tuesday, Bailey's agency announced that a reward of up to $10,000 is being offered for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the forgeries or inmates' escapes. The Florida attorney general's office is offering another reward of up to $10,000.

"(CNN) -- The militants carrying out a terrorist attack at a mall in Kenya include American teenagers, the Kenyan government says. There's no question Al-Shabaab, the group behind the attack, has recruited young Americans. The group has released videos of some going through training camps, including one in which an American declares it ""the real Disneyland,"" CNN affiliate WCCO reported in August. But just who the perpetrators are of the Nairobi mall attack remains unclear. More than 60 people have been killed. ""Both the victims and the perpetrators came from Kenya, the United Kingdom, and the United States,"" Kenyan Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed told ""PBS NewsHour."" The information she had indicates two or three Americans and one British woman are involved, Mohamed said. ""The Americans, from the information we have, are young men, about between maybe 18 and 19."" They are of Somali origin, but lived in Minnesota or other parts of the United States, she said, adding that underlines ""the global nature of this war that we're fighting."" U.S. officials have not confirmed that Americans are involved in the attack, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Monday. Al-Shabaab released names of people who it said were perpetrators. U.S. officials were looking into the names, a senior State Department official said. ""We do know that 40 to 50 Americans have gone over there to join what they call 'the fight,'"" Rep. Michael McCaul, Republican chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, told CNN. ""Certainly, it's very plausible that three of (the attackers) could have been Americans."" The United States has been tracking recruited Americans for several years ""to try to get the identifying travel information, to ensure that these Americans don't come back into the United States, and if they do, they'll get picked up immediately at our airports,"" McCaul said. Mohamed, speaking to PBS, said the attackers' nationalities are ultimately irrelevant. ""They are all evil,"" she said. ""and we must deal with them as such.""","The perpetrators include 2 or 3 Americans and 1 British woman, Kenya's foreign minister says .

"(CNN) -- The year 1990 was not so great for me. Let's see: . John Degl beat me up. Teresa McClure rejected my invitation to the senior prom. Michele Sheehan rejected my invitation to the senior prom. I lost my fifth-straight student council election. Andrew Honohan doused me with chocolate milk. I was given detention for cutting school. My dream college, Penn State, accepted me -- to its Altoona campus. A mole the size of Lake Placid sprouted beneath my nose. From September 1989 through June 1990 -- the span of my senior year at Mahopac High School in Putnam County, New York, -- I never kissed a girl or even held a girl's hand. I never drank a beer, a shot or even a raspberry wine cooler. (Stop laughing -- they were big back then.) I was invited to two parties -- both thrown by my mother. My pants were too short, my haircut was in the shape of a cereal bowl, I ruined the car (a sweet 1980 Datsun 510 that I accidentally drove through a lake) and Alf was canceled after five seasons on NBC. So why, last Saturday, did I attend my 20-year high school reunion? Easy -- because life is short. And boring and dry. And if we don't occasionally force ourselves to face the most uncomfortable of situations, we shrivel up and die in front of the television, a half-eaten bag of stale Fritos in one hand, the remote control in the other. Hence, I entered a ballroom at the Renaissance Hotel in White Plains, New York, took a deep breath and confronted the nightmare that was my youth. I stared down the cheerleaders, the bullies, the jocks, the brainiacs. I looked them over, one by one; thought about all I had gone through; all the anger and resentment that had built up deep inside my guts, and I ... and I ... and I ... Had one of the best nights of my life. Really, I did. If you have a reunion coming up, Go! Without hesitation. Never again will you have a better chance to cleanse yourself, to make peace with the past. Without making an official proclamation, the reunion served as my farewell to any and all longstanding bitterness. I left grudges at the door, and sought out the goodness in those whose formative years had paralleled mine. I danced with Lori Raffa, the girl from the smoking section (seriously, we had one). I chilled with ToniAnn Guadagnoli, the popular cheerleader (and our class celebrity. She's the author of ""Chitter Chatter,"" my daughter's favorite book). I shook hands with Ray Mahoskey, the star running back, and chatted up Pete Lorenzini, the shotputter who was voted track captain over me. For the first time, we were all equals -- all nervous, slightly insecure 30-somethings commiserating over Rodak's Deli and Carmello's Barbershop and those disgusting slabs of pizza that passed as school lunch. But in particular, I paid close attention to the plight of Frank Zaccheo. Back in the day, Frank was one of the most dynamic athletes we had. A staple of the traditional Sunday morning flag football games, Frank ran like the Flash, charged a quarterback like a bull and threw deep bombs with uncanny precision. Twelve years ago, while playing in one of those games, Frank began to inexplicably trip. He went to see a doctor, who diagnosed him with Multiple Sclerosis. The ensuing years have been arduous. Now permanently in a wheelchair, Frank suffers through unspeakable pain and exasperation. Yet when he heard of the reunion, something in Frank -- like something in myself -- stirred. Just as this was my chance to eradicate the suffocating bitterness from my youth, here was Frank's opportunity to travel back in time, to relish four hours not as the wheelchair-bound MS sufferer, but as Frankie Z., the cocksure Italian teenager from long ago.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Former Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman was acquitted Wednesday of corruption-related charges. The triumphant former minister talked to reporters after leaving the courtroom. ""I don't intend to deal with this matter any longer. This chapter is behind me, and I am going to concentrate on the challenges which are already on our doorstep -- and there are plenty of them,"" he said. Liberman announced his resignation last December, a day after the Ministry of Justice said he would be charged with breach of trust and fraud. Liberman has maintained that he has not violated any laws. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been holding Liberman's post open for him until his return. ""I congratulate you on your unanimous acquittal and am pleased that you are returning to the government,"" Netanyahu told Liberman on Wednesday, according to the foreign minister's office. But before Liberman can return to the Foreign Ministry, the government has to vote on his nomination. The allegations . The case against Liberman dates back to 2009. Prosecutors said he pushed to get the Israeli ambassador to Belarus posted to another country after the diplomat allegedly handed over confidential information that included details of a secret police inquiry regarding Liberman. Liberman has faced international criticism for his hard-line stance on Israel's Arab minorities. His ultra-nationalist party is especially popular with immigrants from the former Soviet Union, where Liberman was born and raised.

"(CNN) -- As we tuck ourselves into bed at night, little do we realize that we have the chance to get some extra work done while we sleep. The unconscious mind has long been appreciated as a well of creativity from which some of our greatest artworks, scientific discoveries and inventions have been dredged up. But studies show it is also a powerhouse when it comes to processing unwieldy amounts of information. When making complex decisions that require us to weigh multiple factors, some researchers believe we can benefit from learning to combine our conscious deliberations with unconscious processing. The idea that we only use a small percentage of our brain's capacity is ""completely ridiculous,"" according to Maarten Bos, who researches decision making and the unconscious mind at Harvard Business School. ""We use our brain the whole time,"" he says. We tend to consider the time we spend sleeping, for instance, as a mentally inactive period. But sleep is associated with better memory performance, and ""slow-wave"" sleep in particular has been shown to enhance our ability to make mental connections and integrate unassociated information. This sort of mental heavy-lifting during sleep could be useful for discovering creative solutions to problems and could potentially help combining factors in a way that allows us to make decisions, says Bos. See also: Work skills for the 'conceptual age' ""We sleep a quarter to a third of our lives,"" Bos says. ""Just imagine how great it would be if you can use that time, in a way that's not disrupting us. ""Many people don't like their job, but if you are wrestling with something and you can, without laying awake, help your mind process information, that would actually be pretty awesome."" According to Unconscious Thought Theory, the conscious mind is good at arranging information in accordance with rules, and performing precision maneuvers such as those involved in arithmetic. But compared to the unconscious, it is ""low capacity"" -- we can only consciously think about a certain number of factors at any one time -- and more likely to be bamboozled by irrelevant factors. In comparison, the unconscious is good at synthesizing large amounts of information, and privileging important considerations over trivial ones. In an experiment conducted by Loran Nordgren (Kellog School of Management), Bos and Ap Dijksterhuis (Nijmegen University), a group of subjects were asked to choose the best out of 12 apartments, and given six rules to abide by (rent must be no more than $2,000 a month, must allow dogs), in making their choice. Those given four minutes to consider their decision chose apartments that fit with the rules 75% of the time but selected the best apartment just 29% of the time. Those who deliberated for two minutes and then were distracted for two minutes chose a rule-abiding apartment 44% of the time, but identified the apartment with the best aggregate of attributes 58% of the time. This may sound deeply mysterious, but most of us are probably familiar with the feeling of having arrived at a decision by unconscious means. ""Say you want to buy a house,"" Bos explains. ""You walk in and the house just feels right. This is the place where you think you want to live. There may be factors that are not easily verbalized, and that's where your unconscious mind comes along."" Maybe the real estate agent is diffusing the scent of freshly baked cookies in your direction. Maybe you are just tiring of looking at open homes. But Bos's research suggests that some instincts are the result of the unconscious having correctly identified the best option. Bos explains you can actively use this kind of intuition as a decision-making tool. ""You start with taking in all the information. Then, you distract yourself. Then, whatever feels right, that's the (option) you go with,"" he explains. ""But after that, you check the facts. One house might feel really right when you're there, but it might be built on toxic waste."" See also: Micro managers: Learn to trust your people . A growing body of research suggests that cognitive biases consistently cloud our judgment, and that we consistently overestimate our analytical prowess. Psychologist Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2002 and authored last year's ""Thinking Fast and Slow,"" has explored how our conscious thought processes are susceptible to being disrupted by irrational, subconscious influences. He famously distinguished between two modes of thinking: System 1, which is ""fast, automatic, effortless, associative, and difficult to control or modify"", and System 2, which is ""slower, serial, effortful, and deliberately controlled ... relatively ï¬‚exible and potentially rule-governed"". ""We think that's incomplete,"" Bos says, ""because there's also a slow, unconscious process, and that's what we're talking about."" ""Gut decisions are really fast and influenced by all kinds of things, like stereotyping, or liking the first or last thing you see,"" he explains. ""There's a difference between those, and a slower, more deliberate process that happens subconsciously.""","The unconscious can help make complex decisions, scientists say .

"(CNN) -- In just a few decades, Dubai has risen from relative obscurity to become a global leader in the world of aviation. Emirates Airlines, their national carrier, is the third largest airline in the world according to CAPA Center for Aviation, and at the rate it's growing, it won't be long before it beats out Delta and United to the top the list. The city is host to one of the biggest events on the aerospace calendar: the biennial Dubai Airshow. The five-day show, which kicks off November 17 this year, will be held for the first time at the city's new $32 million Al-Maktoum International Airport -- set to be the world's largest on its 2027 completion. More: 9 unique Dubai restaurants . The 2013 event is expected to be one of the most popular in the show's history, with more than 1,000 exhibitors and 60,000 visitors already registered. ""The days where air shows were dominated by Paris and Farnborough are gone,"" says Saj Ahmad, a chief analyst with StrategicAero Research. ""Dubai is home to Emirates and (budget carrier) flydubai, two of the fastest growing airlines in the world, and thanks to its ever-expanding airport -- which could push Heathrow down the rankings table next year -- Dubai has shown that the region is key to the aviation market."" Read more: The Middle East's airport wars . The Airshow, which first launched in 1989, has become pivotal for plane manufacturers. Over $155 billion worth of deals took place at the 2007 show -- the largest figure for any global aviation event. That same year, Emirates ordered Â£31.7 billion worth of Airbus A380s -- the biggest single order in airline history. In 2011, Boeing received its largest aircraft order -- also from Emirates -- for $18 billion worth of 777-300ERs. ""The legacy of Paris and Farnborough are important. However, Dubai's prominence as a venue for game-changing deals is one that the two European hosts will never match,"" says Ahmad. Infographic: Super-sizing the Middle East's airports . Already there are mumblings of record-breaking orders planned for this year's event. Likely, Boeing will unveil orders for their new 777X widebody jet, and there's rumors that Emirates is planning to purchase 100 of the planes for upwards of $30 billion, while Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways is supposedly set to buy 25 to 30. It should probably come as no surprise that aviation makes up a bulk of Dubai's economy; the industry accounts for nearly 20% of Dubai's workforce and 28% of its GDP. It is becoming important in other countries in the region as well. Aviation contributes $11.4 billion to Qatar's economy and more than $19.45 billion to Saudi Arabia's.

""The geographic position of the Gulf happens to be excellent in the 21st century economic context,"" notes John Strickland, an independent transport consultant.

"(CNN) -- Contaminated and polluted water now kills more people than all forms of violence including wars, according to a United Nations report released Monday that calls for turning unsanitary wastewater into an environmentally safe economic resource. ""At the beginning of the 21st century, the world faces a water crisis, both of quantity and quality, caused by continuous population growth, industrialization, food production practices, increased living standards and poor water use strategies,"" the report by the U.N. Environmental Program says. As a result, ""it is essential that wastewater management is considered as part of integrated, ecosystem-based management that operates across sectors and borders, freshwater and marine."" The report defines wastewater as a combination of fertilizer runoff, sewage disposal and other animal, agricultural and industrial wastes. Wastewater a deadly threat . According to the report -- titled ""Sick Water?"" -- 90 percent of wastewater discharged daily in developing countries is untreated, contributing to the deaths of some 2.2 million people a year from diarrheal diseases caused by unsafe drinking water and poor hygiene. At least 1.8 million children younger than 5 die every year from water-related diseases, the report says. But with proper management, the report notes, ""wastewater can be an essential resource for supporting livelihoods."" For example, some of the chemicals that make wastewater a pollutant, such as nitrogen and phosphorous, can also be useful as fertilizers for agriculture. ""If the world is to thrive, let alone to survive on a planet of 6 billion people heading to over 9 billion by 2050, we need to get collectively smarter and more intelligent about how we manage waste, including wastewaters,"" said Achim Steiner, U.N. under-secretary general and executive director of UNEP. Despite the staggering statistics included in the report, it ""also points to the abundant Green Economy opportunities for turning a mounting challenge into an opportunity with multiple benefits,"" Steiner said, citing reduced fertilizer costs, incentives for conserving such ecological infrastructures as wetlands and salt marshes, and business opportunities in engineering and natural resource management. The report acknowledges that such opportunities will require large-scale investments, such as multimillion dollar sewage treatment plants. ""Financing and investment are urgently needed and must address design, ecosystem restoration construction, operation and maintenance of wastewater infrastructure,"" the report says. But it also offers up simpler solutions, such as education ""to ensure water, nutrients and future opportunities for employment and development are not wasted."" The report's release was timed to coincide with World Water Day, an initiative started in 1992 that aims to raise the profile of water quality.","U.N. report: Polluted water kills about 2.2 million a year; wars claim fewer victims per year .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani government is under pressure to block NATO supply routes to Afghanistan this month if the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in northwestern Pakistan. The demands from Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the opposition party led by cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, come amid anger in Pakistan over the killing of Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, in a U.S. drone strike last week. The Pakistani government had been working on proposed peace talks with the extremist group when Mehsud was killed. ""Just as we were about to start talks -- the very day the Interior Minister planned to approach the Taliban -- a drone strike targeted the Taliban,"" Khan said Monday in the National Assembly. ""So I ask you, Is the U.S. a friend or foe?"" His party is demanding that the national government block the ground supply lines to Afghanistan starting November 20 unless the United States ends the strikes, which have focused on Pakistan's loosely governed tribal areas where many militants are based. Strike 'harmed' peace efforts . PTI, which campaigned heavily against drone attacks in Pakistan, holds the balance of power in the northwestern province Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, through which one of the main NATO supply routes runs. Alongside Khan's demands, the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provincial assembly has passed a motion to block NATO supply lines if the drone strikes don't stop by November 20. There are two supply lines from Pakistan into Afghanistan: the one that passes through Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and another that runs through the volatile southwestern province of Balochistan, where NATO tankers are often attacked. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's office said in a statement Monday that the drone strike last week ""has harmed the dialogue and peace efforts of the government."" ""But we believe that we will not ... allow the dialogue and peace efforts to get derailed,"" it said. ""Diplomatic efforts will be continued to stop these attacks,"" the statement said. ""Given Pakistani peoples' resolve and sacrifices in this war against terrorism, it is incumbent upon the international community to support this endeavor of the government for the accomplishment of peace. The government of Pakistan will not allow any internal or external force to sabotage the dialogue process."" 'Ongoing dialogue' The U.S. State Department said Monday that it had seen the PTI statements about the supply lines. ""We have a strong, ongoing dialogue with Pakistan regarding all aspects of our bilateral relationship,"" said Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman. The supply routes, which are ""important to the U.S., NATO, and Pakistan,"" are fully open at the moment, Harf said. Pakistan closed the routes for several months after a NATO airstrike killed 24 Pakistani soldiers at a checkpoint near the Afghan border in November 2011. The Pakistani Taliban, who have long been conducting an insurgency against the Pakistani government, claimed responsibility for the December 2009 suicide bombing at the U.S. Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan. Five CIA officers were among the seven U.S. citizens killed, along with a member of Jordanian intelligence. The group also claimed responsibility for a failed May 2010 attempt to detonate a car bomb in New York's Times Square. The following September, the U.S. State Department designated the Pakistani Taliban as a foreign terrorist organization. Mehsud, who had a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head, was killed in northwestern Pakistan Friday, senior U.S. and Pakistani officials told CNN.","An opposition party calls for the routes to be blocked if drone strikes continue .

"(CNN) -- Julia Enright often plays at night while watching TV. Billy Byler plays in the airport while waiting for his flight. University student Breanna Reboca, a skilled multitasker, plays on her phone while walking to class. Their addiction? ""Candy Crush Saga,"" an easy-to-play, hard-to-master puzzle game that's seemingly ensnared everyone from your kids to your co-workers to your Aunt Sally. Launched last year, the game is now the most popular app on Facebook, where it has almost 32 million fans. ""Candy Crush,"" as it's usually called, also is among the most-downloaded mobile games for Android and Apple devices and has more than 15 million daily users, according to AppData, an analytics firm. The game has been such a hit for its creator, London-based game publisher King, that the company has plans to go public, according to a report Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal. Like predecessor ""Bejeweled,"" to which it's often compared, ""Candy Crush"" requires players to form chains of brightly colored tiles -- shaped like jelly beans, lemon drops and other candy pieces -- to earn points and advance. The game also borrows from mobile-game blockbuster ""Angry Birds"" in that players must successfully complete one level before going on to the next. ""It looks like the most childish, simple, throwaway game you could ever think of. And then you start playing it,"" said Byler, a pastor to young adults in Wichita, Kansas. ""It's challenging, and a real test on your brain, because you really have to think about what your next move is going to be."" The phone version of the game has 365 increasingly difficult levels, and it's not unusual for daily players to be stuck on a level for several weeks at a time -- a source of much frustration for many Facebook commenters. The basic version of the game is free, although players only get five ""lives,"" or chances, a day without paying for more. Some obsessed players have even hacked the game to get access to unlimited play. Enright, of Waukesha, Wisconsin, got hooked after she began playing the game three months ago with her boyfriend. Now she's on level 213. ""I got a lot further than he did, and now he's given up,"" she said, with a trace of pride. ""I've always liked puzzle games -- 'Tetris' and games like that."" Players also can share their ""Candy Crush"" progress with friends via Facebook -- something that Byler was reluctant to do at first because he was weary of friends posting ""FarmVille"" updates. ""I didn't want to be that guy,"" said Byler, who limits his ""Candy Crush"" public postings to other players within the game itself. Byler is on level 254 and has been surprised by how hard it can be for him to put the game down. ""If I'm not careful, it can suck up a half hour or an hour real quick,"" he said. ""I have to put the phone down and read a book or something."" The game's cruelly seductive nature has even inspired a spoof trailer for a fake film, ""Candy Crush: The Movie,"" about people grappling with their addictions to ""Candy Crush,"" ""Temple Run"" and other mobile games. ""In the beginning, it's fine. You can go in and out of these (game) worlds as you please,"" says one character. ""The thing is, the longer you stay in this world (of ""Candy Crush""), the more likely you are to be imprisoned."" The clip has been viewed on YouTube more than 3.6 million times. Casual mobile games appeal to people like Enright because unlike traditional console games, they can be played in bite-sized chunks while waiting for a bus. A game like ""Candy Crush"" also feeds on people's competitive nature. Who wants to quit halfway through when there are more levels waiting to be conquered? ""I really enjoy it. It helps pass the time,"" Enright said. ""I'm going to just keep going until they run out of levels.""","""Candy Crush Saga"" is among most-downloaded mobile games for Android, Apple devices .

"Dali, Guizhou (CNN) -- Wandering through this remote village nestled among ancient forests and bamboo groves in China's poorest province, it's easy to imagine that life here has changed little over the centuries. Along narrow pathways shaded by the tiled eaves of wooden houses, men deftly balance bamboo carrying poles laden with chillies grown in fields nearby, while women wearing traditional indigo shirts pound dirty laundry in the river. But change is coming to Dali, a village of 300 households in the southwestern Chinese province of Guizhou. In January, the village, along with 20 others in the region, was added to a list of sites that China's leaders believe should qualify for world heritage status -- a step that could put the tiny settlement on a par with The Great Wall or Egypt's pyramids and transform it from a sleepy backwater to a tourist magnet. It's a big opportunity for villagers like Shi Tao, a 25-year-old migrant worker, who is home for the birth of his first child. He'd like to open a guesthouse to cater for the expected visitors. ""We'll make more money if tourists come,"" he says, cradling his sleeping newborn. But for now he must leave his family and head back to the southern Chinese factory town where he makes electronic components for 3,000 yuan (US$490) a month. Untouched charm . As rapid urbanization threatens much of China's rural heritage, tourists will no doubt fall for Dali's untouched charm. At its core is a pagoda-like structure known as a drum tower sitting in a square where villagers dry their crops on rectangles of tarpaulin. The river that winds through the village is crisscrossed by covered wooden bridges where village elders gather to smoke pipes and enjoy the breeze. The river also feeds an ancient water system with separate pools for washing vegetables and laundering clothes. Its poverty and far flung location mean that the three story houses are built from local timber, unaltered by modern construction materials, and in a traditional style unique to the region. ""It's a classic example of mountain village architecture,"" said Wang Hongguan, the director of the Guizhou Provincial Bureau of Cultural Heritage that is behind the world heritage bid. ""They warrant proper protection so I hope they can be inscribed as world heritage sites as soon as possible."" A final decision is made by UNESCO, a U.N. body, which has to decide whether the site is of outstanding universal value. According to the state-run People's Daily, in 2005 China had about 5,000 ancient villages like Dali but by June 2102 this number has decreased to less than 3,000, swallowed up by China's rapidly expanding cities or emptied as villagers leave in search of better prospects. It's a trend that's likely to continue as China's leaders push urbanization as a solution to slowing economic growth. Tourism costs . Despite their enthusiasm, few of the villagers grasp what attaining world heritage status might involve given the advent of mass tourism in China. Tang Shoucheng, the village chief of Xijiang, a picturesque village four hours' drive away, is well qualified to chronicle its highs and lows. Since the village was earmarked for tourist development in 2008, incomes have surged, with 10,000 visitors a day clogging the narrow streets each day during peak season. Residents receive an 18% share of the 100 yuan (US$16) ticket fee to enter the village and the arrival of tourists has created new business opportunities that have enticed people back from factory jobs in more affluent regions. But Tang says that the economic benefits have been uneven. Villagers like him, who live on the hilltop away from the main commercial street, complain they make less money than those who have shop fronts and live closer to the main commercial street. Development has also taken its toll on traditional village life. Once the most important man in the village, Tang says the villagers don't respect traditional relationships anymore. ""Now people only recognize money,"" he says. ""In the past, if you were from the same village, you would always help each other out."" It's a problem not unique to Xijiang. Chinese world heritage sites in Lijiang in the neighboring province of Yunnan and Pingyao in northern Shanxi province have seen locals move out and karaoke bars move in. ""Over-commercialization is a valid concern,"" said Wang, who decided to remove Xijiang from China's tentative world heritage list because of the unbridled tourist development. ""The reason why these places failed is because of the desire for economic development -- culture has become a commodity and people approach it in a degrading way."" Balance . It's no easy task to balance a desire for economic development and heritage preservation, says Han Li, China director of the Global Heritage Fund, a U.S. NGO. It has partnered with the bureau of cultural heritage to evaluate Dali and come up with a management plan for the village that, if successful, would be adopted elsewhere in the province. The organization jumped at the opportunity to undertake planning and conservation work in Dali before tourists arrive in any significant numbers. Tourism at some of GHF's other projects in China, where the organization was brought on board after the sites were awarded UNESCO status, was not well controlled, said Li. She is encouraged by the attitudes of local officials, who appear keen to make sure Dali does not turn into a tourist trap. ""Heritage sites can bring income and development. Our challenge is to find a way to manage this process in a way that doesn't jeopardize the heritage and the traditional way of life,"" says Li. At a meeting in Dali's schoolhouse, village elders, some wearing the faded Mao suits of China's past, welcome the early plans for the village's future -- a wider road, a commercial area for hotels and a museum, plus upgrades to their homes. Snacking on watermelon, few expressed doubts about the pending changes. ""We want to preserve our way of life but progress is important too,"" said Yang Zhou, who wants to find a way for his two children to grow up and stay in the village.","Remote village earmarked to become world heritage site .

"(CNN) -- When the world's leading marathon runners bid to win Olympic gold on Sunday, they would do well to draw inspiration from one of the greatest athletes in the history of track and field. The 42-kilometer race through the streets of London will mark the 60th anniversary of Emil Zatopek's triumph at the Helsinki Games, which completed a triple which is unlikely to ever be repeated. The 29-year-old Czech had already won the 5,000 and 10,000 meter golds and, remarkably, was running the marathon for the very first time. In a host country with a reputation for long-distance running -- Finland's former gold medal winners Paavo Nurmi and Hannes Kolehmainen had lit the Olympic Flame in 1952 -- Zatopek's amazing feat had added resonance, and the crowd chanted his name in unison as he ran into the stadium in splendid isolation. The winning time of two hours 23 minutes and two seconds was also his third world record of the Games in just over a week. The closest any athlete has come to match Zatopek's triple was indeed a Finn, Lasse Viren, who won the 5,000-10,000 double at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal and finished fifth in the marathon. For modern-day distance runners, despite their advanced training techniques, the notion of running the Games' three longest running events in a little over a week would be out of the question -- especially with the men's marathon coming just a day after the 5,000m at London 2012. Golden couple . Zatopek died in 2000, aged 78, but is still survived by his widow Dana Zatopkova, who also won the javelin event at the Helsinki Games, just minutes after her husband had burst clear of three rivals to take a dramatic 5,000m final. They were truly the golden couple of athletics, but had first met in their native Czechoslovakia as both started to make their mark in their chosen sport. ""I knew him before all the awards. And he always said it's good we married because it was only after that that he won any of his medals,"" Zatopkova told CNN. She still works actively to ensure Zatopek's legacy is never forgotten -- and supported Vlastimil Sroubek, who organized a special week of races to mark the 60th anniversary. ""I wanted to call it 'Zatopek's Olympics' but I wasn't allowed to use the word Olympics. So instead I called it 'Zatopek's Golden Week' even though it's over eight days, because in those eight days he won his medals,"" Sroubek said. Zatopek was not a pretty runner, he ran with a tortured style, his head lolling from side to side, but he was a trendsetter, the first to really push the limits in training. He famously donned army boots to run in the winter snow and added weights for extra resistance. ""It is at the borders of pain and suffering that the men are separated from the boys,"" he once said. Grueling sessions . The harder he trained, the more success came -- and Zatopek was no man for half measures. By legend his most grueling session was to run 400 meters -- one lap of a conventional running track -- 100 times, all at speed. Nearly a marathon on sprint efforts, so it was no wonder when he eventually ran the distance competitively he took it in his stride, asking the pre-race favorite, Jim Peters of Britain, if they were running fast enough as they contested the lead. After bursting clear of Peters, the incredible Zatopek had energy enough to chat with journalists who were following the race by car. Zatopkova put his ability to train and compete so ferociously down to his upbringing, taking up an apprenticeship at 14 after failing to make the academic grades to continue his studies. ""He had a hard youth. He was working for the Bata shoe company and it was really hard, their training. And their philosophy was, 'When there is a barrier don't go around it, go over it.' So this is the philosophy which characterizes Emil Zatopek -- hard work and when you have a goal, solve it, do it,"" she said. Helsinki was to prove the peak of his achievements, and by the time of the next Olympic Games in Melbourne in 1956 other athletes, copying his training techniques and refining them, had come on the scene. Zatopek, nursing an injury, came sixth in the marathon behind his longtime rival and friend Alain Mimoun of France. Eventual retirement . He retired from competition the following year, but he continued to be involved in track and field, playing the generous host when visitors came to Prague to compete in races or to seek advice. Australian Ron Clarke, who broke 17 world records in the 1960s but never won a gold medal in a major championship, stayed with Zatopek and Zatopkova and was treated to more than their legendary hospitality. Zatopek took him to the airport and as they said goodbye, pushed a parceled gift into Clarke's hand. When he later opened it, Clarke was dumbfounded -- it was one of Zatopek's golds from Helsinki. This generosity of spirit and consideration for his fellow man extended to Zatopek's political beliefs. He was an outspoken supporter of the Prague Spring, as the Czech government of Alexander Dubcek demanded freedoms while still a client state of the Soviet Union. After Soviet tanks brought a bloody end to the reforms in 1968, Zatopek was eventually stripped of his position as a colonel in the Czech army. As Zatopkova recalled it was not an immediate demotion, because with the 1968 Mexico Olympics taking place, Zatopek was in the media spotlight. National hero . ""Right around the Olympics he was a national hero, it was not possible for the government to punish him. But later during the Soviet occupation he was working as a dustbinman. He got his punishment,"" she said. After the Iron Curtain came down, Zatopek was reinstated to his former eminence by Czech president Vaclav Havel in 1990. He lived out his days in the modest apartment he shared in Prague with his wife, suffering in his later years during a long period of ill health. In 1998 they celebrated their golden anniversary; Zatopek asked Dana to marry him during the 1948 London Olympics where he had won gold in the 10,000 and silver over 5,000.

"(CNN) -- Officials rescued a 19-year-old New York University student who was stuck between two buildings near his dorm in lower Manhattan Sunday night, New York police said. The New York Fire Department received the emergency call around 5:07 p.m. and found the man stuck in a space about six to 12 inches wide, according to firefighter Michael Madison. It took about 90 minutes to break through three layers of cinder block and pull the man out from the tight space, he said. After being rescued, the man was transported to Bellevue Hospital Center and is in serious condition, Madison said. Authorities do not know how the man became trapped. He was was conscious as officials removed him from the space between the two residential buildings at 80 Lafayette Street, according to police Det. Kellyann Ort. This type of emergency situation is uncommon, and officials are still investigating how the man managed to get stuck, Madison said.","A 19-year-old man became stuck between two Manhattan buildings, police said .

"(CNN) -- A deadly shooting at a checkpoint at Los Angeles International Airport emphasizes airport security vulnerabilities, according to analysts and a union chief. A gunman opened fire on Friday at a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint at LAX, killing a TSA officer. The suspect was eventually shot and taken into custody, police said. The slain officer was the first TSA employee killed in the line of duty, according to J. David Cox Sr, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents many TSA workers. The TSA's checkpoint officers are not law enforcement and are not armed. While Friday's tragedy was a first, ""assaults of officers occur on a daily basis,"" said Cox, in a telephone conference call. Asked what could be done to improve security at the airport, Cox said he would like ""our officers to be able to make arrests. That would be a big improvement if they had arrest power."" Instead, they have to turn to local law enforcement when assaulted. Even with the most highly trained TSA officers, some incidents can't be prevented, said Richard Bloom, director of terrorism, intelligence and security studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. If security officials choose to focus on terrorism in a post-9/11 world, ""other threats to security may not be attended to as much as they should be,"" he said. Bloom suggested that training and better pay would go a long way in developing more sophisticated security. ""Are they paid as much as they should be, trained appropriately and recognized and rewarded for doing a good job?"" he asked. ""Do you want a highly paid security and intelligence officer or a rent-a-cop?"" American airports are not prepared for violence on the ground, said Rafi Ron, president of Virginia-based New Age Security Solutions. Most of the measures taken since 9/11 are aimed at protecting aircraft from attack. ""In the United States, we don't have vehicle checkpoints and we don't have people watching who comes into the terminals and the presence of armed personnel is very, very thin,"" said Ron, a former head of security of Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel. Vehicles driving into Ben-Gurion Airport must clear a vehicle checkpoint, and there are security personnel at all terminal entrances, he said. ""It would be almost impossible to walk into the terminal with a gun. If he started shooting, he would probably be dead in a matter of seconds because of the heavy presence of security personnel."" The gunman on Friday approached a checkpoint at Terminal 3 at 9:20 a.m. and began shooting at the TSA employee, according to an ex-LAPD officer who happened to be at the scene. The shooting was not the first at the airport. In 2002, an Egyptian national killed two people and wounded four others at the ticket counter of Israel's El Al Airlines before a security guard shot and killed him. Despite these violent incidents, unauthorized guns at the airport are often discovered in passenger carry-on bags as they pass through checkpoints. The TSA screens about 1.8 million passengers every day. The total number of guns seized by the TSA at airports around the country has been on the rise since 2007. The agency seized 1,556 guns in 2012, nearly double the 803 guns confiscated in 2007, according to agency figures. In 2013, the agency seized 1,343 guns through the end of September, 13 of which were confiscated at LAX. The Los Angeles airport is the sixth busiest in the world based on total passengers (63.7 million in 2012), according to Airports Council International.","TSA seized 1,556 guns in 2012, nearly double the amount in 2007 .

"London (CNN) -- A Roman sculpture of an eagle with a writhing serpent firmly gripped in its hooked beak was unveiled Wednesday in London, where archaeologists found it on a site earmarked for a hotel development. Archaeologists in London say the statue is one of the very best examples surviving from Roman Britain. ""The skill of the craftsman is apparent; with the forked tongue of the snake and the individual feathers of the eagle still clearly discernible,"" a news release from Museum of London Archaeology said. The archaeologists were ""at first hesitant to announce the discovery and to proclaim its Roman origins, owing to its almost unbelievable preservation,"" it said. But the limestone statue, which stands nearly 26 inches tall, has now been dated by experts to the first or second century. It was dug up at a site in the City of London, the UK capital's financial center, which is known once to have been home to a Roman cemetery. According to the museum, the symbolism of the statue can be understood ""as the struggle of good, the eagle, against evil, the snake,"" a common theme in relation to funeral sites. Archaeologists believe the sculpture may once have sat in an alcove on a fancy mausoleum whose foundations were also uncovered in the dig. The statue will be on display at the Museum of London for the next six months. A number of discoveries highlighting London's Roman past have been made in recent months in connection with major construction projects. They include about 20 Roman-era skulls found beneath London's Liverpool Street station by workers digging a new rail tunnel. Read more: London dig turns up slice of Roman life .

"(CNN) -- It's thousands of square miles wide, virtually devoid of oxygen and it has been blamed for an increase in shark attacks: the Gulf of Mexico ""Dead Zone"" is getting bigger and forcing marine life -- including sharks - into shore. Signs warn the public in an area harboring high bacteria near a drain at Will Rogers State Beach, California. The zone has been caused by a flood of nutrients, such as agricultural fertilizers, which boost algae production in the sea. These growths consume huge amounts of oxygen creating a ""marine desert"" almost devoid of life. The ""Dead Zone"" varies in size each year, but in 1999 it was 7,728 square miles -- that's nearly the size of Delaware and Connecticut combined. The huge size of the ""Dead Zone' is due to the increase in nutrient pollution flowing down rivers, including the Mississippi, which is estimated to have risen threefold in the last fifty years as chemicals become more and more common on farms. Environmentalists fear that the drive to radically increase the amount of corn-based biofuels produced in the U.S. from 15 billion gallons to 36 billion by 2022 could increase pollution in the Mississippi by 19 per cent. But the problem is by no means limited to U.S. waters. Similar ""Dead Zones"" are being discovered across the world and a major United Nations report in 2003 found that the number had doubled each decade since the 1960's. The UN report also warned that the number will continue to increase as intensive agriculture spreads around the world and that they are already having a significant impact on commercial fish stocks. All of this can come as quite a surprise. Growing water demands, more pollutants . Think about pollution and you tend to imagine tall smoking chimneys or pipes pouring industrial effluent into our rivers and lakes. But the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly becoming a concern for environmentalists across the world. Agriculture, including livestock and poultry farming, can be a source of a wide range of pollutants that find their way into our water supplies through run-off and leaching. This happens when rainfall exceeds the capacity of the ground and it flows into watercourses and groundwater supplies taking dissolved pollutants with it. These can include sediment from eroded land, as well as phosphorus and nitrogen compounds from chemical fertilizers and animal waste, which can also harbor disease pathogens. These pollutants can have a serious effect on water sources by depleting oxygen levels, stunting the growth of plants and even suffocating fish -- as in the Gulf of Mexico ""Dead Zone."" The concentration of pollutants can be particularly high in drought years, when heavy water demand can reduce the flow rate in rivers and cut their ability to dilute chemicals. The effects of this can be acute in the developing world, where the pressure to feed a growing population combined with a low level of regulation can cause serious problems. A huge increase in the amount of synthetic chemicals being used in the Philippines over recent years has caused substantial environmental damage to the country's water supplies, according to a 2008 report by Greenpeace. Between 1961 and 2005 fertilizer use in the Philippines increased by 1000 percent. ""This model of agricultural growth is fatally flawed because of declining crop yields and massive environmental impacts,"" says Greenpeace campaigner Daniel Ocampo. ""Aside from causing land degradation and losses in soil fertility, agrochemicals cause water pollution that directly and indirectly affects human health."" According to Greenpeace, analysis of groundwater in the Benguet and Bulacan provinces in the Philippines, found that 30 percent of tested wells had nitrates levels above the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water safety limit. The Philippine National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) says that 37 per cent of water pollution in the country originates from agricultural practices. As well as causing an increase in the algal blooms that can cause ""Dead Zones,"" agricultural nitrates have been identified as a factor in the growth of toxic ""red tide"" algae and high levels in drinking water can also pose a health risk to humans, especially children. Agriculture's impact on water pollution . Clearly there is a need to shift away from the current industrial agriculture system which promotes the reliance on agrochemicals while neglecting to consider their negative effects on human health, the environment, and the economy of local communities. The problem is particularly serious in China, where a combination of rapid development, a growing population and intensive agriculture has led to widespread pollution and even water shortages. Scientists studying information from monitoring stations have said that 44 per cent of Chinese rivers are polluted. ""Many lakes and water courses contain an excess of nutrients and need treatment before they are suitable as freshwater sources,"" the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in 2005. According to Chinese state officials 10 per cent of farm land in the country is polluted posing a ""severe threat"" to food sources, with excessive agricultural chemical use being blamed, along with industrial effluent and solid waste. But controlling water pollution from agricultural run-off presents many challenges: it occurs over a wide area, goes across borders and often the source is hard to identify. It also varies over time and can increase or decrease depending on changes in land-use and ownership. Lax local law enforcement, corruption and inefficiency can all compound the problem. Legislators around the world are calling for a closer integration of environmental and agricultural policies, and more help for farmers in managing potentially hazardous substances. But many environmentalists see a solution with increased incentives for organic farming, which uses fewer chemicals and, argue groups such as the UK Soil Association, with no appreciable decrease in yields. But while the solution remains a matter of debate, the scale of the problem continues to grow and grow.

"(CNN)  -- A French filmmaker who recently finished a documentary about a violent street gang in El Salvador was found shot dead in the town of Tonacatepeque, about 10 miles northeast of the capital city of San Salvador, authorities said. French documentary filmmaker Christian Poveda was found shot dead 10 miles northeast of San Salvador. Christian Poveda, 52, was shot at least four times in the face, according to local reports. Poveda's documentary, ""La Vida Loca,"" which follows the lives of members of the Mara 18 street gang, had been screened at a handful of film festivals and is slated for wider release later this month. His body was found in an area controlled by that same gang, local reports said. A motive of Poveda's murder Wednesday was being investigated, National Civil Police Director Carlos Ascencio Giron said in a statement. Citing the pending investigation, police did not immediately give any details, but Ascencio Giron said that the homicide and organized crime divisions of his department were handling the case jointly with the attorney general's office. Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes said he was ""very shocked"" by the news of the murder. According to a statement by the president's office, Poveda first arrived in El Salvador in the 1980s to cover the civil war as a photojournalist. He left to report from other war zones, but returned to research and film the gangs in El Salvador. iReport.com: Magazine editor remembers Poveda . Poveda on Wednesday was traveling in his car after filming in a town called Soyapango when unknown assailants intercepted him and then shot him, according to the statement. The homicide sector chief for the National Civil Police, Marco Tulio Lima, told the newspaper El Diario de Hoy that police detained one person in connection to the killing, but did not say if the person was a suspect. ""Christian Poveda's recent film about El Salvador's street gangs provided a powerful inside look into youth violence in one of Central America's most dangerous regions,"" said Carlos Lauria of the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""We urge the authorities to conduct a prompt and exhaustive inquiry into his murder and bring all those responsible to justice."" In March, ""La Vida Loca"" was a hit with audiences at the Guadalajara International Film Festival in Mexico, the organization told CNN through a spokesman. Poveda gave himself fully to his work and spent years following the Mara 18, the festival spokesman said. ""Creating documentary implies working for the love of the profession, and that was what our friend Christian showed us in the short time that we had the opportunity to know him,"" the Film Festival said in a statement. The producer of Poveda's documentary, Carole Solive, told The Guardian newspaper that, ""He went out alone . . . to get back in touch with the gang whose story he had filmed."" ""But their boss was in prison and he found himself in the middle of very restless young capos who, for the first time, asked him for money,"" she said.","French filmmaker Christian Poveda, 52, shot at least four times in the face .

"(CNN) -- Meat is murder? Well, perhaps not for much longer. Artist Banksy has satirized modern farming and meat production; could in-vitro meat be a better option? A pioneering group of scientists are working to grow real animal protein in the laboratory, which they not only claim is better for animal welfare, but actually healthier, both for people and the planet. It may sound like science fiction, but this technology to create in-vitro meat could be changing global diets within ten years. ""Cultured meat would have a lot of advantages,"" said Jason Matheny of research group New Harvest. ""We could precisely control the amount of fat in meat. We could make ground beef with an ideal fatty acid ratio -- a hamburger that prevents heart attacks instead of causing them."" But it isn't just the possibility of creating designer ground beef with the fat profile of salmon that drives Matheny's work. Meat and livestock farming is also the source of many human diseases, which he claims would be far less common when the product is raised in laboratory conditions. ""We could reduce the risks of diseases like swine flu, avian flu, 'mad cow disease', or contamination from Salmonella,"" he told CNN. ""We could produce meat in sterile conditions that are impossible in conventional animal farms and slaughterhouses. And when we grow only the meat we can eat, it's more efficient. There's no need to grow the whole animal and lose 75 to 95 percent of what we feed it."" Conventional meat production is also hard on the environment. The contribution of livestock to climate change was recently highlighted by the United Nations' report, ""Livestock's Long Shadow"", while groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have demonstrated how soy farming for animal feed contributes to the destruction of the Amazon. In this context Matheny believes his project could significantly cut the environmental impact of meat production -- using much less water and producing far fewer greenhouse gases. ""We could reduce the environmental footprint of meat, which currently contributes more to global warming than the entire transportation sector,"" says Matheny. Preliminary results from a study by Hanna Tuomisto, at the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, University of Oxford, suggest that cultured meat would reduce the carbon emissions of meat production by more than 80 percent. Making cultured meat . In-vitro meat is made from samples of animals conventionally slaughtered. For example, ""pork"" is made from pig ovaries retrieved from slaughterhouses, which are fertilized with pig semen, transforming them into embryos. They are then placed in a nutrient solution, where they grow and develop. It's a long way from the popular image of animals wandering round the farmyard in the sunshine, but then so is modern intensive farming. The factor that could take the research from the lab to the store and into refrigerators around the world is its remarkable commercial potential. According to New Harvest, meat is already estimated to be a $1 trillion global market, and demand is expected to double by 2050. With concerns about health, animal welfare and the environment growing the appeal of in vitro meat is obvious. Matheny told CNN that venture capitalists Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers have shown an interest in his technology, while Stegman, a sausage subsidiary of food giant Sara Lee, is a partner. The Netherlands' Government has also invested around $4 million in Dutch research into in-vitro meat production. But it isn't just the suits who are circling with their checkbooks out -- campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) have announced a $1 million prize for the first commercially viable in vitro chicken product. The Humane Society of the United States has also been supportive. ""We think that a technology to produce cultured ground meats -- burgers, sausages, nuggets, and so forth -- could be commercialized within ten years,"" said Matheny. ""As with most technologies, successive generations should improve in price, quality, and acceptance. We don't think that matching the taste and texture of ground meats will be very difficult. Both conventional and cultured meat is made of muscle tissue. And conventional ground meat is typically highly processed. Chicken nuggets for instance, are made of something called 'meat slurry' -- it would be hard not to do better!"" Public attitude . But the public doesn't always blindly buy what companies believe they should, and acceptance of what is a very radical proposition certainly isn't a foregone conclusion. There are bound to be claims of ""Frankenfoods,"" and reaction against the work. ""Social acceptance isn't guaranteed, but we all want meat that's safer and healthier,"" he said. ""If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then I think acceptance will be high. The more we learn about the health and environmental impact of conventional meat, the more cultured meat looks like a good alternative."" One obvious touchstone for how in-vitro-meat will be received by the public is perhaps the way GM crops were -- or were not - accepted around the world, something that Matheny draws encouragement from. ""What's interesting about the GM issue is that it has been controversial in some places, but is a non-issue for most consumers,"" he said. ""Most Americans are regularly eating GM foods. In any case, it's not necessarily the case that cultured meat would involve GM foods. ""We all want meat that's safer and healthier. If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then do we care that it's produced in a steel tank, rather than in an animal farm? ""Take hydroponic vegetables. We like the idea that they're produced in sterile water instead of dirt and manure. It's true that in-vitro meat isn't natural. Nor for that matter are hydroponic vegetables, or bread, or cheese, or wine. Raising 10,000 chickens indoors and pumping them full of drugs isn't natural, either, and it isn't healthy or safe. The more we learn about how meat is produced now, the more in-vitro meat looks like a better alternative."" Lab-produced meat also raises some ethical considerations. Kate McMahon, Friends of the Earth Energy and Transport campaigner, believes more attention should be paid to improving livestock conditions rather than developing in-vitro meat. ""At a time when hundreds of small-scale, sustainable farming operations are filing for bankruptcy every day, it is unethical to consider purchasing petri dish meat. Rather, we should be making it easier and more affordable to raise livestock in a safe, humane and ecologically sensitive manner,"" she told CNN. Gillian Madill, Genetics Technologies spokesperson for Friends of the Earth, thinks that clear parameters for in-vitro development need to put in place: ""If we can successfully develop these products, what is the defining line between lab-grown meat and natural animals?"" she told CNN. ""That is an especially important question since a high level of differentiation and tissue complexity is required to replicate muscle tissue that we use as meat. We need to draw clear lines in order to prevent the commodification of all life."" Ultimately the success of in-vitro meat may be less about consumer sensibilities and more about the hard realities of feeding a growing global population in a finite world. ""With India and China doubling their meat consumption every decade, there's no sustainable way to satisfy the growing global appetite for meat without a significant improvement in technology,"" said Matheny. ""Cultured meat offers one solution. Improved plant-based meat substitutes offer another. I expect both will be needed."" Test tube burgers? It seems you could be eating them sooner than you might expect. What do you think of in-vitro meat? Do you think it could be a solution to the problems connected to meat production and climate change?

"(CNN) -- Houdini wouldn't speak to me. He refused to say one word. He hasn't spoken to anyone for 87 years -- since he died. Every Halloween, Harry Houdini fans try to prize a few words out of the world's greatest escapologist. Before he died, Houdini promised to send a message back from the Other Side. After his death in Detroit on October 31, 1926, his wife, Bess, inaugurated the official Houdini séance. He hasn't been heard from. Yet. This year's séance will be held at the Halifax Citadel National Historic Site. The citadel is a 19th-century fort. The catacombs are supposedly haunted. Houdini played Nova Scotia and toured the Canadian Maritimes in 1896. The séance will feature performances by local magicians. Some proceeds will go to the ""Feed Nova Scotia"" initiative, a province-wide food bank. Seating is limited. Admission is $45. Guests this year include escape artist Lucas Wilson, holder of three Guinness World Records, and the daughter of Jacques Price, one of the three men in the dressing room when Houdini received the fateful punches to his stomach. The medium charged with getting through to Houdini is Alan Hatfield of Pictou Landing First Nation. A former truck driver, Hatfield has been a professional psychic since 1988 and has helped on several missing persons inquiries. He claims to have spoken with victims of the Titanic disaster buried in Halifax's Fairview Cemetery. ""I don't know much about Houdini any more than the casual observer interested in magicians,"" he says. ""I like to have no preconceived information but to begin all endeavors with spirit dialogs from Ground Zero status. It's a privilege to be asked to be part of the séance."" Spirit hotline remains dead . In 2001, I had the honor of sitting at the séance table in Milwaukee, the first journalist to do so. Sadly, Houdini didn't show up. Or pick up. The line to the Other Side remained dead. Hatfield is more confident of success. ""I'm not a traditional trance medium, but have had great results, using sweet grass and prayer to open doorways,"" he says. ""And employing EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) recordings in communion with disembodied souls."" Among those joining hands around the table will be historians, collectors and experts such as Bill Radner, whose late father Sid owned the world's largest Houdini collection. This included the only recording of the magician's voice. The memorabilia was sold at auction in 2004. ""We always have the séance handcuffs on the table,"" says Radner. ""Only Houdini knew how to open them. They are similar to those he escaped from in a 1904 challenge in London staged by Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper."" Houdini said he would open the handcuffs from the afterlife, if he could. ""They were very important to my father,"" says Radner. ""He bought them from Harry's brother, Theodore, who performed as Hardeen, and were first used in a séance in 1948."" Until 1995, the official Houdini séance was held at his graveside in New York's Machpelah cemetery. It has since taken place around the United States as well as in London and Montreal. Great escapologist, but he couldn't drive . ""Harry was an amazing guy,"" says fan and ""Inner Circle"" member Tom Boldt, a construction executive from Wisconsin. ""There wasn't much he couldn't do. Except perhaps drive. He was the first man to fly a plane in Australia. In 1910. He even toured in Russia. ""The séance has become part of Americana. It's an opportunity to retell Houdini's incredible rags to riches story. And another serious attempt to honor Houdini's claim that if anyone could return from the hereafter, it would be him."" Fellow table member and séance host Bruce MacNab from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, wrote an award winning book, ""The Apprenticeship of Harry Houdini,"" about The Metamorphosis, Houdini's tour of eastern Canada. He spent five years researching it. ""Houdini spent a month in the area and stayed in the Carleton House in Halifax,"" says McNab. ""He discovered the straitjacket on the tour. ""His show at Yarmouth was his first one outside of the U.S. And the one in Dartmouth his first international one as a headliner."" Along with Frank Lloyd Wright, Senator Eugene Macarthy and Liberace, Houdini is one of Wisconsin's favorite sons. His hometown of Appleton, two hours north of Milwaukee and one hour south of Green Bay, offers self-guided walking tours around Houdini-related sites, like the Houdini Elementary School. The school motto is ""The Magic of Learning. The Magic begins here."" There are the Houdini Escape Gastropub and the Stone Cellar Brewpub, which serves ""Houdini Honeywheat"" or ""Weiss"" beer. From shoe shiner to crowd pleaser . Born Ehrich Weiss in Budapest in 1874, Houdini spent the first nine years of his life in the Wisconsin town now famous for dairy farming and a fire engine factory. Appleton boasted the United States' first enclosed shopping area and the country's first hotel with electrified lighting. And first hydroelectric plant. Houdini's father, Samuel, was the town rabbi. He preached above Heckert's Saloon, now a carpet shop and bridal outfitter. The family home is now a shopping plaza. The only physical landmark left from Houdini's boyhood is the wooden Temple Zion synagogue at 320 North Durkhee Street, which was built around the time Rabbi Weiss was sacked from his $750 a year job for not being able to preach in English. The family moved to Milwaukee in 1883. Houdini and his brothers shined shoes and worked as newspaper boys for the Milwaukee Journal. Their father became a kosher butcher. Houdini took his name from the French illusionist, Robert-Eugene Houdin. His first professional performance is thought to have been at the Pasadena Athletic Club in New York. There's a small Houdini museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. and the University of Texas in Austin hold collections. There are commercial museums at Houdini's Magic Shop in Las Vegas and Fantasma Magic in New York. Magician David Copperfield has a private collection. The Museum At The Castle in Appleton also has exhibits. Its gift shop sells straitjackets. But no butter churns or manacles. ""We hope to hear from Harry soon,"" says Boldt. ""He might make his comeback if he knows it's a sellout crowd. ""He was the ultimate showman. He once said that only when people were sure he was licked would he appear. He was a master of suspense."" This year's Houdini séance takes place October 31 at the Halifax Citadel National Historic Site and is open to the public; entrance fee $45; more information at this leading Houdini fan site.

"(CNN) -- The curtain is coming down on the New York City Opera after it failed to raise the $7 million it needed to stave off bankruptcy. On top of that money, the opera company also needed to raise an additional $13 million by the end of 2013 to put toward future seasons, it said in a news release. Because it ""did not achieve the goal of its emergency appeal,"" it said in a statement Monday, ""the board and management will begin the necessary financial and operational steps to wind down the Company, including initiating the Chapter 11 (bankruptcy) process."" The company had hoped to raise $1 million of the $7 million through an online site, Kickstarter.com, in a campaign that ended Monday. It raised only $301,019 from more than 2,000 donors. The organization raised $1.5 million outside of the Kickstarter campaign, according to Risa Heller, spokeswoman for the New York City Opera. ""The odds have been against us for a long time,"" George Steel, general manager and artistic director for the company, said in a video for the failed online campaign, ""but in the face of that difficulty we have made tremendous progress."" The company, dubbed ""The People's Opera"" by former New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, was founded on the principle that every New Yorker should be able to afford to go to the opera, Steel said. He explained that in order for the company to break even, it would have needed to sell every ticket for $600. Instead, the starting ticket price was set at $25 to make the experience affordable. The New York City Opera received critical praise in the past for its world premieres of works including Robert Ward's ""The Crucible"" and Anthony Davis' ""The Life and Times of Malcolm X."" It opened its current season on September 17 with the opera ""Anna Nicole,"" which turned out to be the company's last production. ""We need the help of the people we were founded to serve to put on our season this year,"" Steel had said, speaking to New York residents and opera fans everywhere. ""We need you to come together and carry it forward into the future. I hope we can count on you."" In a statement from the American Federation of Musicians, President Tino Gagliardi said that despite the musicians making great sacrifices in wages and benefits to keep the City Opera afloat they long feared this would happen. ""NYCO management's reckless decisions to move the New York City Opera out of its newly renovated home at Lincoln Center ... predictably resulted in financial disaster for the company,"" Gagliardi said. The opera company left Lincoln Center in 2011 in an effort to save money. Since then it had staged performances at various venues. This year marked the 70th anniversary of the New York City Opera, which opened in 1943 as the second opera house in the city. The Metropolitan Opera was founded over 60 years earlier, in 1880.","""The People's Opera"" was founded on the idea that every New Yorker should have access .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Introducing a new word: ""cultuphobia."" It means the fear that another person's culture is taking over your own. The word may be new, but the concept is ancient. America is a land of immigrants that has, in truth, never liked immigrants -- no matter where they came from and whether they came with the proper documents or a letter of reference from the Queen of England. Part of the reason that we don't like immigrants is because they frighten us. And one way in which they frighten us is because we worry that -- with the changes they bring -- they'll wind up marginalizing us and making us less important and less relevant. There is a name for that fear: cultuphobia. For an example, look at what happened this week to mark the launch of the new English-language, Latino-targeted television network Fusion, founded by ABC and Univision. The parent companies came up with what they thought was the cute idea of swapping anchors on their top-rated morning shows. The Spanish-language show, ""Despierta America,"" which is based in Miami, sent hosts Raul Gonzalez and Karla Martinez to New York for some early morning chitchat with George Stephanopoulos and Robin Roberts, the hosts of ""Good Morning America."" Meanwhile, GMA sent Lara Spencer and Sam Champion to Miami to visit with the ""Despierta America"" crew. Come to think of it, this was a pretty good idea. And no one seemed to enjoy it more than the hosts who switched places. In New York, Gonzalez and Martinez were on the ""Good Morning America"" set on the same day as Enrique Iglesias, who sang a new song. Everyone seemed comfortable with one another, and there was a lot of laughing and dancing. In Miami, Spencer told The Huffington Post that she ""had no idea how much fun it was"" to be on Spanish-language television and implored producers to ""please have me back."" Champion proclaimed that he loved the experience and didn't want to go back to New York. ""I'm staying,"" he told the website. More laughing and dancing, this time to mariachi music. It is no wonder that it all went so well, proclaimed Mexican actor Eugenio Derbez, who was also a guest on ""Despierta America"" that day. His hit movie ""Instructions Not Included"" is in limited release in the United States. After all, these days, the language barrier is just a puddle jump and, he said, among Latinos in the U.S., ""everyone speaks both English and Spanish."" Here is where the story gets interesting. Judging from the reaction on the ""Good Morning America"" page on Facebook and the comment section following news stories about the switch, many regular viewers of ""Good Morning America"" did not appreciate the gimmick. In fact, many of them were furious. Some said they changed the channel. Others vowed to never watch the show again if there is a repeat performance. ""This had better be a one-time thing,"" wrote one disgruntled viewer. One woman complained that, when she tunes in to her favorite morning news show, she expects to get what she always gets -- the news of the day ""in ENGLISH."" There's the giveaway. For many of those angry ""Good Morning America"" viewers, it might just have been a case of them preferring to stick with what they like. But for others, it was a case of cultuphobia. These viewers aren't just protecting their favorite show, but -- as they probably see it -- their language, culture and civilization. This is the other side to cultural marketing, and it's ugly. A corporation -- or in this case, a media company such as ABC -- might vie for a larger market share by going after a new set of viewers and alienate its core audience members, who feel slighted, ignored or insulted. When that happens, the core isn't quiet. The core speaks up. Maybe next time, the company decides it isn't worth it. I hope that doesn't happen here. I hope ABC will stand its ground and continue down this road of trying to reach Latino viewers. Still, I'm not sure how Fusion will perform in the long run. I have concerns, and I'm not alone. While the new network is marketed to younger viewers who speak English, it doesn't seem that they've thought deeply about how to reach their viewers. That's not an easy demographic group to tap into, for either marketers or media. Plus, Fusion would be better off not becoming simply an English-language, hipper version of Univision, where -- as I would put it -- the anchors are white and the politics are blue. The liberal Spanish-language network is all about advocacy journalism and protecting what it sees as the interests of Latino immigrants -- especially the undocumented. Yet, on most of its telenovelas, which are produced in Mexico, the lead actress is European-looking with light skin. So, at Univision, they seem to believe that dark-skinned immigrants should have the full pallet of rights -- except, apparently, the right to appear in a starring role on Spanish-language television. That's evidence of a different kind of phobia, and a depressing reminder that -- in either language, and either of side of the border -- people are the same, and prejudice is alive and well.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal sealed a remarkable comeback in 2013 by beating Stanislas Wawrinka at the ATP World Tour Finals on Wednesday to ensure he will finish the year as world No. 1. The Spaniard also qualified for the semifinals of the only major tennis tournament he has never won, with the 27-year-old boasting a career grand slam in addition to an Olympic gold medal. Since returning to the sport in February after seven months out with a knee injury, the 13-time grand slam champion has won 10 titles in a year which he has described as one of his best. Beating Wawrinka in London confirmed that he finishes on top of the world for the third time in his career, with Novak Djokovic now forced to settle for second place. The Serbian had held the honor the past two years, while Nadal is the first player to win it back twice. ""A lot of emotions today,"" Nadal said following his 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (8-6) over the Swiss eighth seed. ""It's the perfect scenario to be finally the year-end No. 1 in this fantastic stadium, in front of this unbelievable crowd, so many thanks for making me feel like this. ""This has been an unbelievable comeback year."" It certainly has. When he returned to action in Chile in February, Nadal moved so gingerly at times that he felt it better to leave some points as he attempted to protect his troublesome knee. A first title since the 2012 French Open followed later that month in Brazil, and these were soon followed by further triumphs in Mexico and Indian Wells. Comprehensive confirmation of the fact that ""the King of Clay"" had fully recovered his abilities came at the French Open when he beat Djokovic in a compelling semifinal before defeating compatriot David Ferrer to claim a record eighth title at Roland Garros. Humiliation followed at Wimbledon as the former champion was beaten by Belgium's 135th-ranked Steve Darcis, the first time Nadal had exited a grand slam in the first round. Yet he recovered to clinch the U.S. Open in September, beating Djokovic in the final, and before a packed crowd at London's O2 Arena on Wednesday, Nadal said his extraordinary return would have been impossible without his family. ""The team is everything for me,"" he explained. ""Without them, I would never have the chance to be back where I am today -- being the No. 1 at the end of the season when there are such unbelievable competitors in front of me. ""Without my family team behind me, it is impossible to think like this, especially after what happened last year."" Swiss finals debutant Wawrinka now has a win and loss ahead of his final round-robin match against Ferrer, while Nadal will close against Tomas Berdych. Third-ranked Ferrer lost out to Czech Berdych in Wednesday's late game 6-4 6-4.","Rafael Nadal will be the year-end world No. 1 for the third time in his career .

"London, England (CNN) -- Proving that records are meant to be broken, even after 114 years, a British-led rowing team Saturday won bragging rights for crossing the North Atlantic. The four men, who left New York City on June 17, completed their journey at St. Mary's Harbour on the Isles of Scilly after rowing, rowing, rowing and more rowing for almost 44 days, the Ocean Rowing Society International reported. The Artemis Ocean Racing team, led by Leven Brown, finished in 43 days, 21 hours, 26 minutes and 48 seconds, knocking more than 11 days off the 55-day record set by a pair of Norwegians in 1896, according to the UK Press Association. Dozens of people lined up at the dock and crowded on to boats in the harbor to witness the team's arrival. Other members of the crew are Ray Carroll of Ireland, Don Lennox of Britain and Livar Nysted of Faroe Islands. ""The funniest thing for me was walking up the quayside -- after more than six weeks of not walking, my legs felt more than a bit unsteady,"" Brown, 37, of Edinburgh, Scotland, told the BBC.","The four-man crew from Artemis Ocean Rowing were in their boat for six weeks .

"(CNN) -- Roma's hopes of a record-extending 11th successive Italian Serie A victory were thwarted Sunday by a team that hadn't won in six matches. Torino's streak was stretched to seven by the 1-1 draw, which gave Turin rival Juventus a boost in its bid to win a third successive title. The result left league leader Roma three points clear of Juve and Napoli, who both won on Saturday. The capital club, seeking a first title since 2001 under the guidance of new French coach Rudi Garcia, seemed on course for another routine win when Dutch midfielder Kevin Strootman fired a 28th-minute opener. But Torino hit back in the 63rd minute through striker Alessio Cerci, whose eighth league goal this season -- the second best behind Fiorentina's Giuseppe Rossi -- moved his team up to 12th place. It was only the second goal scored against Roma in the top flight this season, the other being by Parma in September. The visiting side, which had the only 100% record in the major European leagues, again missed the attacking presence of captain Francesco Totti and Ivory Coast forward Gervinho, both sidelined by injury. Inter Milan reclaimed fourth place with a 3-0 win at Udinese that kept Walter Mazzarri's team above Verona on goal difference. Verona beat Cagliari 2-1, while Roma's seventh-placed city rival Lazio lost ground with a 2-0 home defeat by Genoa. In France, former Roma coach Claudio Ranieri suffered his first Ligue 1 defeat this season with Monaco, which lost 2-0 at Lille. Lille climbed above the principality club into second place behind champion Paris Saint-Germain, which has a two-point advantage following Friday's 4-0 win over Lorient. Nolan Roux scored both goals to inflict Monaco's second successive reverse, having also lost in the League Cup in midweek. In Spain, Atletico Madrid kept the pressure on La Liga leader Barcelona with a 2-0 win at home to fifth-placed Athletic Bilbao. Diego Costa joined Cristiano Ronaldo at the top of the scoring charts with his 13th goal this season, while strike partner David Villa added the other -- his sixth since leaving Barca. The victory put Atletico a point behind the unbeaten champion and five clear of third-placed city rival Real Madrid, which struggled to a 3-2 win over bottom club Rayo Vallecano on Saturday. Valencia moved into the top half of the table with a 1-0 win at Getafe, while Malaga climbed clear of the relegation zone with a 3-2 victory at home to third-bottom Real Betis. In England, Tottenham and Everton both failed to claim second place in the Premier League after playing out a goalless draw. Visiting Spurs moved up to fourth, on goal difference behind Liverpool and Chelsea, and five points adrift of London rival Arsenal. It left Everton a point further back in seventh, below Manchester City and Southampton. Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris played the last half an hour after receiving a heavy blow to the head which required nine minutes of injury-time to be added. The France international refused to go off the pitch despite medical advice. ""Hugo still doesn't recall everything about the incident,"" Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas said. ""I made the call to keep him on the pitch because of the signs he was giving. The saves he did after the incident proved that right."" Promoted Cardiff won the first Welsh derby to be played in the EPL, triumphing 1-0 against Swansea -- whose former defender Steven Caulker headed the only goal.","Italian league leader Roma held to 1-1 draw away to Torino on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Was this the real Rory McIlroy or an imposter? Given it's Halloween, it's a fair question. The former world No. 1 hasn't won a title all year but led Shanghai's HSBC Champions -- the fourth and final World Golf Championships event of 2013 -- after the first round and then proclaimed it was his finest 18 holes this season. It bodes well for the Northern Irishman, who is chasing a spot at the season-ending event on the European Tour, the World Tour Championship in Dubai. Perhaps beating Tiger Woods in an exhibition this week in China gave sixth-ranked McIlroy an added boost after a difficult year in which he failed to qualify for the PGA Tour's 30-man finale. McIlroy said Thursday's seven-under-par 65 bettered his 64 at the Deutsche Bank Championship in Boston at the end of August. ""That was a good round of golf,"" the 24-year-old told reporters. ""But this is probably better just because it was a little trickier conditions. There was a bit of breeze and you've got to play good golf to shoot seven under around this place. ""It's only one round of golf, but it's definitely the way I wanted, and needed, to start this week, keeping in mind that I obviously want to play myself into Dubai and try to pick up my first win of the season, as well. ""It's one of the best rounds I've played this season."" McIlroy struck eight birdies and only one bogey, on the 11th hole. ""It felt good to be out there and be in control of my golf ball,"" he said. ""It's a great start, but it's only 18 holes. ""I've tried to stay patient the entire season, and I know that if I believe that I'm working on the right things -- and I am working on the right things -- then things will start to fall into place sooner or later."" McIlroy was two shots clear of Spain's Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano and Wales' Jamie Donaldson. U.S. Open champion Justin Rose and former Masters winner Bubba Watson were another shot back. British Open champion Phil Mickelson was tied for 28th, six shots behind McIlroy. Although he finished at one-under-par 71, his round was undone by a quadruple bogey on the eighth when he twice found the water, and he dropped another shot at the following hole -- his last, having started on the back nine. Recently crowned FedEx Cup champion Henrik Stenson struggled, with the Swede finishing at two-over-par 74 to be tied for 57th in the 78-man field at Sheshan International.","Rory McIlroy leads Shanghai's HSBC Champions after the first round .

"(CNN) -- One of the most surprising moments of this year's Oscars came at the very end, when first lady Michelle Obama showed up on video to help announce the best picture winner. If you're anything like us, you immediately wondered what the significance could be, especially since she was announcing the award from the White House. But when you think about it, having Obama help draw the Oscars ceremony to a close was a fitting way to end this politically saturated awards season. The real-life drama of D.C. politics can be absorbing enough on its own, but mix in Hollywood machinations and you could create a must-see movie. Political themes have been popular at the Academy Awards in the past, but this year's list of best picture contenders was rife with them. There was ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" which was nominated in a number of big categories on Sunday and ended up in a tie for the best sound editing Oscar. Regardless of its lack of statues, Kathryn Bigelow's project remains one of the most talked-about movies of 2012 thanks to its plot centered on the hunt for Osama bin Laden. The script, written by Mark Boal, lit the match for fiery debates on torture. Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln,"" a recounting of how the 16th president brought the Civil War to an end and passed the 13th amendment, was a giant in the walk-up to the Oscars. Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Abraham Lincoln won him the best actor Oscar, and Day-Lewis was sure to thank the man who inspired his role. (His beard in the film, by the way, was real.) And of course there was ""Argo,"" the year's best picture winner, which followed a secret CIA operation to rescue six American diplomats during the Iranian hostage crisis in 1980. The film was not only a critical success, but it was thought-provoking, too. Since its release last fall, its historical accuracy has been called into question and its depiction of Jimmy Carter's term has been picked apart. (The Los Angeles Times' ran a cartoon of a shocked Lincoln memorial after the Oscars ceremony. ""Argo?!"" the cartoon read. ""You mean I lost to the Carter administration?!"") That's not to mention ""Argo's"" international reach, as it sparked criticism from Iranian authorities. We know Hollywood's version of politics well -- which celebrity said what, when, and to whom -- but it seems this awards season shifted our focus somewhat to grander themes. These ""best picture contenders,"" wrote CNN contributor John Avlon, ""have managed to pay off at the box office even as they brought politics and history to the big screen -- proof that we'll take smart over stupid as long as we're entertained while educated.""","First lady Michelle Obama helped announce the best picture Oscar .

"Washington (CNN) -- When President Obama raises his hand, I will put down my pen. Or rather, I will step away from my computer keyboard. Inauguration Day will signal the culmination of an effort I launched on January 20, 2009, to write a letter to the White House every single day of Barack Obama's first term. And I do mean every day. Weekends, holidays, when he was on vacation, and when I was on vacation. I wrote in my office, at home, in moving airplanes, cars, trains and even while running through the woods. I wrote early in the morning, in the middle of the day and late at night. I wrote about things that were important, like unemployment, Afghanistan and women's rights. I also wrote about things that were trivial, like sports, favorite foods and my yearly battle with Christmas lights. The tally: 1,460 letters, well over a half-million words, or enough to fill about seven novels. Laid out as one line of text, these letters would stretch almost 3Â½ miles or considerably longer than the inaugural parade route. I did not intend to get in this deep. Read Tom Foreman's latest letter to Obama ... and all the others . The first letter, written on that cold Inauguration Day four years ago, was a bit of a lark. Some weeks earlier, Barack Obama had suggested he wanted to hear from citizens about how to run the country. I thought it would be funny to post a series of letters for his first 10 days on the AC360 blog. People liked it, I decided to go for a month, and Bob's-your-uncle here we are. The first year was easy. We all have ideas about what we would do if we were in charge. Bad ideas usually, but ideas nonetheless. I prattled on about the economy, security, bipartisanship, foreign affairs and his bowling technique. The second year grew a bit harder. By thinking every day about the presidency, I became more aware of how many intractable, repetitive issues press down upon any person who takes that job. It's Biden time . In the third year, I surged ahead. Having accepted that my fountain of easy ideas had run dry, I dedicated more serious thought to what I would say. To be sure, the letters became less entertaining, but I liked to imagine that they had more substance, although in retrospect I was probably wrong. And in this fourth year, I struggled. It seemed many days as if I'd already said everything I had to say and then some. At one point I had considered writing letters to the White House for the rest of my life. The fourth year convinced me that this would be a bad idea. I found myself counting the days to January. Obama's new term resolutions . Along the way it occurred to me that being president is probably much harder than most of us suppose. After all, if it is this exhausting just thinking about the job, imagine what it is like actually punching the Oval Office clock. Truthfully, I offered very little advice. More often I presented general notions about how one approaches problems; the same notions I would pass on to anyone in any position who faces daily challenges. Which, I guess, is pretty much all of us. I don't know if he ever read a single line. All I know is that in almost every missive, I invited the president to give me a call. He never did. And I don't blame him. Beware the tortoise . Whether a Democrat or Republican fills that office, answering to the needs of 311 million people is a magnificent and daunting challenge, let alone answering their letters. So I will close my series with the same letter that started it all, by far the shortest of the bunch. Dear Mr. President, . Congratulations! Watching you on that podium today, surrounded by so many hundreds of thousands of Americans, I could not help but feel inspired by the miracle of democracy and the greatness of our nation. I also have a question: Do you have any idea what you've gotten yourself into? I know you are busy today, but call when you can. Regards, .

"(CNN) -- An Afghan delegation plans to travel to Pakistan to hold talks with one of the founding members of the Taliban, the Afghan president's office said Wednesday. The planned visit plays into efforts to pursue peace in war-torn Afghanistan, where NATO and Afghan troops have been fighting the Taliban for more than a decade. The delegation of the Afghan High Peace Council will hold talks with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a former Taliban leader who was released last month from detention by Pakistani authorities. A date for the trip has not yet been announced. Baradar, who had been held in a secret location, used to be the Taliban's second-in-command, after Mullah Mohammed Omar. He was captured in 2010 in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, which is known to be a haven for many militants from across the country and its bordering regions. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has long pushed for Baradar's release -- his government was suspected to be in secret talks with the militant when he was captured. Baradar had been under United Nations sanctions since February 2001, with his assets frozen and travel banned. The U.N. had forbidden selling weapons to him. The agreement for the Afghan delegation to meet Baradar was made Tuesday in London where British Prime Minister David Cameron held talks on the Afghan peace process and other issues with Karzai and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. It is the latest gesture by Sharif's government, which took office this year, to improve ties with neighboring Afghanistan. On September 7 -- before Baradar's release -- it freed seven Taliban figures to facilitate the peace process. Two weeks earlier, Karzai had visited the Pakistani capital of Islamabad and stressed the importance of Pakistan's assistance in any path to peace.","A delegation will travel to Pakistan to meet Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar .

"(CNN) -- Two 15-year-olds broke into a Denver middle school armed with what appeared to be BB guns and ransacked several rooms before being taken into custody, police Chief Robert White said Tuesday. Authorities believe the two wanted to steal items from the school, White said. No students were in the building at the time of the late-night burglary at Rachel B. Noel Middle School, and classes were expected to go on as usual Tuesday, he said. An employee saw the students enter the school around 10 p.m. with what appeared to be rifles. Officers surrounded the school before taking the boys into custody. While authorities have not moved the weapons the boys were spotted carrying, investigators who looked at them think they are BB guns, White said. One of the teens was also carrying a computer in a backpack. The other suspect's backpack has not yet been examined, he added. The teenagers, whose identities have not been made public because they are juveniles, were being interviewed by investigators early Tuesday, White said. ""Preliminarily, the intent appeared to be burglary,"" White said. White said the same pair attempted to break into Greenwood Elementary school earlier in the evening, but weren't successful.

"(CNN) -- Egyptian security forces arrested a senior leader of the Muslim Brotherhood early Wednesday, the interior ministry said, the latest move in an extended crackdown on the Islamist movement. Essam el-Erian, the vice chairman of the group's political wing -- the Freedom and Justice Party -- was found in a Cairo suburb and was subsequently arrested and booked, the ministry said in a statement. Before his arrest, he was one of the most senior Muslim Brotherhood leaders still at large. The military and police have detained large numbers of Brotherhood officials and supporters since the ouster of former President Mohamed Morsy in July. A court banned the movement in September. Egypt's general prosecutor had issued an arrest warrant for el-Erian, the former leader of the majority party in Egypt's upper house of Parliament, accusing him and other party members of ""inciting violence"" and ""aiding criminal acts,"" the interior ministry said. The military's overthrow of the democratically elected Morsy, amid widespread demonstrations calling for his resignation, has plunged Egypt deeper into turmoil. Hundreds of people have been killed in clashes between security forces and supporters of Morsy and the Brotherhood, many of them when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo in August. The U.S. government said earlier this month that it was suspending hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Egyptian military over the bloody crackdown on the Brotherhood.","Essam el-Erian is detained by security forces in a suburb of Cairo .

"(CNN) -- Zahra Baker had been an international symbol of strength and hope: A freckle-faced girl who lost part of her left leg at age 5 and her hearing while being treated for cancer, she kept smiling and fighting through it all. Yet Zahra's life ended violently in fall 2010. That's when her stepmother, Elisa Baker, told police in Hickory, North Carolina, that the girl, then 10, was killed and dismembered, according to search warrants. The youngster's body parts were then disposed of in various locations, the stepmother told police. While police found some of Zahra's remains in the weeks after she was reported missing, some parts hadn't been accounted for. But authorities took a major step forward on this count Thursday, with the confirmation that a skull found in April 2012 in Caldwell County, North Carolina, belonged to the girl. 2010: North Carolina community remembers Zahra Baker . ""The life and death of Zahra Baker profoundly impacted those who came to know this brave young lady through her tragic story,"" said District Attorney James Gaither Jr., whose district includes the section of central North Carolina where the crime occurred and whose office confirmed the finding about Zahra's skull. ""Zahra and her life will be forever in our thoughts, and 'Team Zahra' will forever be connected through her spirit."" Members of the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, the North Carolina Medical Examiner's Office and the Marshall University Forensic Science Center in Huntington, West Virginia, analyzed the skull and told Gaither's office it belonged to Zahra. But the analysis did not establish the cause of the girl's death. Police began looking for Zahra on October 9, 2010, after her stepmother reported her missing and authorities found a ransom note that was later determined to be fake. At the time, authorities said that no one other than a relative had seen the girl since September 25. Elisa Baker was arrested the next day on several charges unrelated to Zahra's disappearance, including writing worthless checks. 2011: Stepmother charged with murder . Meanwhile, the search for the young girl grabbed national and international headlines given her story, her age and the fact both of her biological parents are from Australia. A prosthetic leg thought to belong to the missing girl was found in a brushy area off a North Carolina road in late October 2010. Some of her other remains were found November 11 of that year. Zahra's stepmother eventually told police the girl had been killed two weeks before she was reported missing. In September 2011, she pleaded guilty to second-degree murder with aggravating factors and was sentenced to 18 years in state prison, according to the district attorney's office. According to an indictment, Elisa Baker ""desecrated the victim's body to hinder detection, investigation and prosecution of the offense."" She is now in federal custody awaiting sentencing on drug conspiracy charges after pleading guilty in January 2012 to one count of conspiracy to sell drugs. 2011: Search warrants provide grisly details in Zahra Baker's death .","Zahra Baker lost her left leg at age 5 and her hearing as she battled cancer .

"New York (CNN) -- The court documents continued to fly in the ongoing legal battle between Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez and Major League Baseball. As Rodriguez' appeal of his 211-game suspension went on hiatus this week so the arbitrator could tend to other matters, the MLB responded to his lawsuit against it and Commissioner Bud Selig with a motion to move it from state court to federal court in hopes it will be dismissed. In its 426-page filing, the MLB argues that Rodriguez should abide by baseball's collective bargaining agreement and pursue his appeal solely through the arbitration process. Rodriguez: 'I'm fighting for my life' In response to the motion, Rodriguez' attorney Joe Tacopina told CNN, ""As is its practice, MLB has chosen to share its filing with the press well before sending it to Mr. Rodriguez's legal team. Nonetheless, Mr. Rodriguez's claims against MLB and Commissioner Selig arise from their tortious conduct, separate and apart from the issues being decided in the arbitration process. It is ironic that MLB -- having filed suit in state court in Florida for tortious interference in order to obtain evidence to use in the arbitration proceeding -- now complains that Mr. Rodriguez's tortious interference claim must be heard as part of the arbitration. MLB knows that these state law claims properly belong where they were filed, in the New York State Court."" Attorney: Rodriguez had 'consulting relationship' with Biogenesis . Last Friday Rodriguez filed suit against Selig and the MLB alleging that they ""engaged in tortious and egregious conduct with one and only one goal ... to destroy the reputation and career of Alex Rodriguez."" The lawsuit claims that in its investigation of Anthony Bosch and his Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in Miami, Major League Baseball engaged in vigilante justice to prove that Rodriguez was using performance enhancing drugs. Rodriguez fights suspension . ""They have ignored the procedures set forth in baseball's collectively bargained labor agreements; violated the strict confidentiality imposed by these agreements; paid individuals millions of dollars and made promises of future employment to individuals in order to get them to produce documents and to testify on MLB' s behalf; bullied and intimidated those individuals who refused to cooperate with their witch hunt; and singled out (Rodriguez) for an unprecedented 211-game suspension -- the longest non-permanent ban in baseball history,"" the suit says. Rodriguez, 38, says he is fighting for his life in an effort to overturn the suspension. He has hired a high-priced team of lawyers, publicists and investigators. He has shown up each day during this week's arbitration process at the MLB's Park Avenue headquarters. His lawsuit outside the arbitration process is an effort to save his reputation and his $25 million salary for the 2014 season.

"(CNN) -- Most of the great land expeditions in the world have already been conquered. But British explorers Ben Saunders and Tarka L'Herpiniere are about to set off on one of the last. The two-man team is heading to Antarctica to attempt to walk the 2,987 kilometer (1,800 mile) journey to the South Pole and back. If they succeed, it will be the longest unsupported polar journey in history. They will be re-tracing the steps of Captain Robert Falcon Scott who had hoped to be become the first man to reach the South Pole. It was only when the ill-fated British explorer arrived at the Pole in January 1912 that he found someone else had beaten him to it. His rival Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had claimed the honor 33 days earlier. Read more: Landmark exhibition celebrates century since Scott's fateful journey . ""I can't imagine what their morale must have been turning around at the Pole, having found a Norwegian flag there, and having to walk all the way back to the coast,"" says Saunders. Scott himself gives some insight to his feelings in the journal found with his body when it was discovered in November 2012 just 17.7km (11 miles) from a supply depot that could have saved his life. ""Great God! This is an awful place,"" he wrote. It has been more than a century since Scott died on that return journey and while many have since visited the South Pole, no one has ever even attempted to walk the entire round trip without a support team. ""It just seemed to be hanging out there as a journey that ought to be finished,"" says Saunders, who will attempt the feat. There will be no dogs, no support team. Just two men with 200kg sleighs walking across what Scott described as a ""slough of despond."" A century on, Saunders and L'Herpiniere will still face the same brutal Antarctic conditions as Scott. They will have to negotiate ever-changing glaciers riddled with crevasses where temperatures plunge as low as -50 degrees Celsius (-58 degrees Fahrenheit). But what they will have is state-of-the-art equipment and technology. ""We have clothing, equipment, food and technology that Scott could never have dreamed of,"" says Saunders. ""It actually has more in common with space flight than guys dragging wooden sleighs around."" The ability to communicate could not only be potentially life-saving, but will also allow Saunders to upload blogs, video and photographs to the Scott Expedition website throughout what he hopes will be a ground-breaking four-month journey.","Tarka L'Herpiniere and Ben Saunders plan to walk 2,987km to the South Pole and back.

"(CNN) -- A third U.S. Navy official has been charged in a case accusing them of accepting prostitution and other services from a Singapore-based defense contractor in exchange for business and favorable treatment, according to the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego. U.S. Navy Cmdr. Jose Luis Sanchez, 41, was arrested Wednesday in Florida and is expected to be taken to San Diego to face charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, the office said. Facing the same charge in Sanchez's case is contractor Leonard Glenn Francis, a Malaysian citizen and CEO of Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd. Francis -- arrested earlier this year in San Diego -- also is charged in the other Navy officials' cases. Federal prosecutors allege Sanchez, as deputy logistics officer in the U.S. 7th Fleet and later as the Fleet Logistics Command's operations director, directed Navy business and sensitive information to Francis' company, which provides security, supplies and other services to U.S. Navy ships at various ports. In return, Francis gave Sanchez more than $100,000, travel expenses and prostitutes during a period covering January 2009 to April 2013, the U.S. attorney's office said. Navy officer, NCIS agent arrested in multimillion-dollar bribery case . ""According to the allegations in this case, a number of officials were willing to sacrifice their integrity and millions of taxpayer dollars for personal gratification,"" U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said Wednesday. ""While the overwhelming majority of the 400,000 active duty Navy personnel conduct themselves in a manner that is beyond reproach, we and our law enforcement partners ... continue to investigate the allegations of fraud and corruption that tarnish the stellar reputation of the U.S. Navy."" Sanchez is accused of giving Francis Navy ship schedules and other classified information to help Francis' company win and maintain Navy business, the U.S. attorney's office said. Sanchez is alleged to have e-mailed to Francis internal Navy discussions about the company, including legal opinions, and made recommendations in the company's favor about port visits, according to the office. Federal prosecutors also allege that Francis, in an October 2011 e-mail, asked Sanchez to use his company to refuel a U.S. Navy ship at a Thai port. ""Ask and you shall receive. ... We worked this out this morning,"" Sanchez allegedly responded in an e-mail, according to federal prosecutors. As a result, the USS Mustin paid more than $1 million for fuel from Francis' company at Laem Chabang, Thailand -- more than twice what it would have cost under an agreement previously negotiated by the Navy, federal prosecutors allege. Francis ""allegedly hired female escorts for Sanchez and friends on multiple occasions,"" the U.S. attorney's office said in a news release. Calls seeking comment from Sanchez's attorney -- assistant federal public defender Adam Allen of Florida -- and Francis' attorney, Edward P. Swan Jr. of San Diego -- weren't immediately returned Thursday. Two other Navy officials -- Cmdr. Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz and Naval Criminal Investigative Service Supervisory Special Agent John Bertrand Beliveau II -- were arrested in probes involving Francis' company in September. According to federal prosecutors, Misiewicz, 46, as deputy operations officer of the U.S. 7th Fleet, helped schedule visits of U.S. Navy ships to ports where Francis' company worked. ""In return, Francis provided Misiewicz with paid travel, luxury hotel stays and prostitution services,"" the San Diego U.S. attorney's office said. The information Misiewicz passed on to Francis was ""confidential,"" meaning its disclosure could cause serious harm to U.S. national security, the U.S. attorney's office said. It detailed Navy ship movements months in advance, according to the U.S. attorney. A separate complaint alleges Beliveau, 44, provided Francis with information about an NCIS fraud investigation into his company's dealings with the Navy. ""In exchange, Francis provided Beliveau with, among other things, paid travel, luxury hotel stays and prostitution services,"" the U.S. attorney's office said. The complaint states that Beliveau made arrangements to travel to Bangkok, Thailand, through the same travel agent Francis used. Read the complaint against Beliveau . No evidence was found that Beliveau paid for his hotel or travel, or that he reimbursed Francis for the trip. Francis also arranged for a female escort to entertain Beliveau while there, according to the complaint. In return, Francis allegedly saved 125 NCIS investigative reports to his government computer. The affidavit states the reports were in connection with the NCIS investigation into Glenn Defense Marine Asia -- Francis' company. All four men are charged with conspiring to commit bribery and could face up to five years in prison if convicted. Navy SEAL video game scandal . Beliveau was arrested in Virginia and Misiewicz in Colorado, where he was serving with the U.S. Northern Command at Peterson Air Force Base. If true, the allegations against Misiewicz will tarnish what has been an inspiring immigrant success story. Born in Cambodia and adopted by an American woman serving in the U.S. Army in Phnom Penh, Misiewicz came to the United States in 1973, a few years before the Khmer Rouge takeover of Cambodia. Millions died during the group's brutal reign in what became known as the ""Killing Fields."" Misiewicz went on to earn his commission from the U.S. Naval Academy and in 2010 was in command of the destroyer USS Mustin when it made a port call in Cambodia. ""It is important for me to be strong and to remember and honor the sacrifices that were made for me,"" Misiewicz said at the time, according to a Navy News Service report. ""Both Cambodians and Americans in my young life sacrificed life and happiness so I could have a better life."" ""Anything is possible. You can start anywhere, any place, if you've got freedom and you have opportunity like we have in the U.S., the sky is the limit,"" he said in the report.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's decision to seek congressional authorization of a military attack against the Syrian government is in part his way of trying to fix a legal problem. The president's decision to launch military strikes that would be ""limited in duration and scope"" is illegal under international law, legal experts say. The United Nations charter generally doesn't allow nations to attack other nations unless the attack is in self-defense or has the approval of the U.N. Security Council, neither of which is the case in Syria. That's a problem for a president, who has tried to distinguish his administration from that of President George W. Bush on the idea that he is bringing the United States back into compliance with international law. CNN has learned that the Justice Departments' Office of Legal Counsel provided the president with a preliminary legal opinion on carrying out the Syrian attack. OLC lawyers are the ones who advise the president on whether he is acting lawfully under federal statutes and the Constitution. The opinion was provided verbally to the White House and is expected to be followed with a formal written opinion in coming weeks. The exact legal reasoning in the opinion could not be learned but sources familiar with the matter said the president's legal team believes he is acting lawfully. Is it 'High Noon' for Obama on Syria? To help bolster the president's legal case, the Obama administration over the weekend asked Congress to authorize the use of military force. It's a departure for the president, who didn't seek similar approval when the United States joined a United Nations-sanctioned bombing campaign in Libya. But it is more in line with the view that Obama expressed as a senator and presidential candidate, that presidents need congressional approval to wage war. Congressional approval wouldn't solve the problem with international law, a senior administration official said, but it would enhance the legitimacy of military action. Obama, in a Rose Garden statement Saturday, spoke of the humanitarian and moral reasons to respond to what the United States says is clear proof that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces have used chemical weapons against civilians. Obama called the most recent alleged chemical weapons attack near Damascus ""an assault on human dignity."" A senior administration official acknowledged the international legal constraints but said the president is authorized to take action with or without Congress, in part for U.S. national security reasons. The president in his Saturday statement said the use of chemical weapons against civilians poses ""a serious danger to our national security."" The administration uses similar language in the Authorization for Use of Military Force proposal it is presenting to Congress, citing the need to protect the United States and its allies and partners from the threat of chemical weapons. A second senior administration official said the United States is acting on humanitarian as well as security grounds. ""We are not trying to address all of the humanitarian aspects of the crisis, but the security and humanitarian elements of the situation are inextricably linked and it would be artificial to separate them,"" the official said. ""The security situation endangers the welfare of the populations in the region, and the humanitarian situation -- including the flows of refugees and displaced persons -- endangers the security and stability of countries in the region. ""Left unanswered, there is serious danger that the August 21 use of chemical weapons would lead to further use in this and future conflicts, posing a humanitarian threat both to those victims who would suffer these weapons' scourge and a security threat to neighbors, others in the region, and the international community as a whole."" The thorny political and legal problems the president faces were on display over the weekend as some lawmakers returned to Washington early to receive intelligence briefings and to prepare to vote on the authorization. The administration's proposed authorization for action in Syria is broad and open-ended, and many lawmakers emerged from briefings with deep misgivings. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said that among about 100 members present, the biggest single concern was the ""very broad request for authority"" that is at odds with the narrow scope of the mission the president outlined. Syria vote could have consequences for 2016 . Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy of Vermont, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Sunday told reporters he would propose a more narrowly tailored authorization. Fears grew over the weekend that the administration's broad proposal could lead to a wider conflict and perhaps U.S. military strikes in Iran or Lebanon, because Iran's Lebanon-based Hezbollah allies are providing support to the Assad regime. The administration official said the military authorization was written narrowly to address Syria but asserted it also has to take contingencies into account. If the United States found chemical weapons were being transferred to Iran, and the only way to stop such a move was by striking in Iran, then the proposed authorization wouldn't prevent Obama from ordering such strikes. John Bellinger, former legal adviser to the State Department and the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, said Obama's international law problem is of his own making. ""This particular president has boxed himself into a corner to distinguish himself from his predecessor,"" he said. Of Obama's planned Syria military strikes, Bellinger said, ""even if it's with the purest of motives, it makes him look hypocritical."" Robert Chesney, a University of Texas law professor, drew parallels to the Clinton administration's bombing against Serbian forces to protect Kosovo. In that case, President Bill Clinton ignored the fact that a proposed military force authorization was voted down in Congress. Chesney said the problem is that international law doesn't necessarily take into account events like those in Syria or Kosovo. In these cases the argument becomes, Chesney said, that ""it was legitimate, but illegal (under international law). It was the good thing to do because of the moral reasons."" Some human rights groups have long pushed for international law to allow outside intervention to stop atrocities. The United States and other nations have been reluctant to accept such a broad change, Bellinger said. The administration's lawyers have been careful to guide the choice of words used by top officials. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, who made a forceful case for military action on Friday, have carefully portrayed al Assad's actions as violating ""international norms."" That's in part because Syria isn't among the 188 countries, including the United States, that signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, the treaty that prohibits the production and use of such weapons. Obama has long grappled with the issue of how to deal with civil war atrocities when international law doesn't offer a way to stop them. In his December 2009 speech to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, Obama endorsed a call for an ""evolution of human institutions."" On one hand, he said, it is important for the United States and other nations to respect international rules, saying ""when we don't, our actions appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy of future interventions, no matter how justified."" But then he also noted the need to ""prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government, or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region."" Obama added: ""I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds, as it was in the Balkans, or in other places that have been scarred by war. Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later. That's why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace.""

"(CNN) -- A pilot died Thursday after his plane crashed in eastern Australia during efforts to fight vast bush fires that have threatened the suburbs of Sydney in recent days. The water-bombing plane went down in a remote area more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Sydney, said authorities in New South Wales, the Australian state where fires have ravaged tens of thousands of hectares of land and destroyed more than 200 homes. Rescue crews found the body of the 43-year-old pilot after reaching the crash site in rugged terrain. He was the only person on board the plane and his family has been notified, police said. ""We're acutely aware there's a family suffering today because their dad hasn't come home,"" said Shane Fitzsimmons, the commissioner of New South Wales Rural Fire Service. He said the crash started a new fire in the area that other firefighting aircraft are now tackling. Many fires still not contained . More than 60 blazes continued to rage in the region, over 20 of them out of control, fire service spokeswoman Natalie Sanders said Thursday. The fire service has issued emergency warnings for two of the fires in the hard hit Blue Mountains region west of Sydney, telling residents to leave the area of find shelter, she said. But the overall threat has decreased from Wednesday, when more than 1,500 firefighters battled for hours against blazes propelled by powerful gusts of wind. The weather is cooler Thursday, Sanders said, and winds are gusting up to 75 kilometers per hour (about 45 mph) -- still strong, but less severe than the 85-100 kph gusts on Wednesday. ""The broader risk to a more larger population has certainly eased,"" Fitzsimmons said Wednesday. He warned, though, that there were ""many hours of firefighting still to come, many hours of concern for those who are living in the fire affected areas."" Defense exercise blamed . The threat was indicated by the scale of one of the two most alarming bush fires in the Blue Mountains. Known as the State Mine fire, the blaze has engulfed more than 125,000 hectares (300,000 acres) of land and has a perimeter of more than 300 kilometers, Sanders said. And the cause of that fire has stirred anger among local residents. The fire service said Wednesday that the blaze was the result of live ordnance exercises on an army range in the State Mine area. The flames have destroyed 10 buildings and homes in the area since October 16. The Australian Department of Defense issued a statement acknowledging defense personnel were conducting an explosive training activity in the same area on the day the fire started. The department is conducting its own investigation into the military exercise. The scores of fires have damaged huge areas in the past week, but human casualties have been limited. Before the pilot's death on Thursday, the only fatality was a 63-year-old man who died of a suspected heart attack on October 18 while defending his home against a blaze on the New South Wales Central Coast. Officials have underlined the severity and the unusual timing of the fires, which have struck during a very dry spring in the Southern hemisphere. ""Never before have we seen the extent of damage and destruction and wide-scale fire activity at this time of the year,"" Fitzsimmons said Wednesday. CNN's Aliza Kassim, Kevin Voigt, Laura Smith-Spark, Marcy Heinz, Robyn Curnow and Larry Register contributed to this report.","The water-bombing plane crashed south of Sydney, authorities said .

"(CNN) -- Oilfield services giant Halliburton pleaded guilty Thursday to destroying test results that investigators had sought as evidence in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, and federal prosecutors announced a related charge against one of its executives. In a federal court in New Orleans, Halliburton admitted to throwing out test results on the design of the well at the heart of the disaster. The company was given the maximum fine of $200,000 on the charge, the Justice Department said. In announcing the plea, the Justice Department also announced that it was accusing Anthony Badalamenti, who was Halliburton's cementing technology director at the time of the blowout, with a single count of destroying evidence. Halliburton and well owner BP are still battling in court over responsibility for the April 2010 disaster. Halliburton, as the cement contractor on the well, says it told BP to use more devices to center the cement casing in the well but BP ignored its advice. The issue has been a key point of contention between the two companies in hearings and litigation ever since. But prosecutors accused Halliburton of running computer simulations in May and June 2010 that showed ""little difference"" between the 21 centralizers it says it recommended and the six BP eventually used -- and then destroying the results. Thursday's charge against Badalamenti alleges that he gave the order to destroy the results. Efforts to contact him for comment were not immediately successful. The Deepwater Horizon blowout killed 11 rig workers and unleashed the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. The federal government estimates more than 200 million gallons poured out of the ruptured well, located nearly a mile underwater off southeastern Louisiana. The environmental effects of the disaster are still being determined, and BP says it has paid out $32 billion for cleanup, compensation and penalties. In 2011, BP accused Halliburton of destroying evidence -- including ""inexplicably missing"" computer modeling results -- ""to eliminate any risk that this evidence would be used against it at trial."" Halliburton is the last of the three major players to admit criminal wrongdoing in the 2010 blowout and resulting oil spill. BP has admitted to manslaughter and 13 other criminal counts and agreed to pay $4 billion in fines, while Transocean, owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, admitted to violating the Clean Water Act and paid $1.4 billion in civil and criminal penalties. A federal report in 2011 concluded that BP, Halliburton and Transocean all violated federal offshore safety regulations and shared responsibility for the disaster.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When Nina Temple was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2000, then aged 44, she quickly became depressed, barely venturing out of her house as she struggled to come to terms with living with the chronic condition. Sing for Joy is a choir made up of sufferers of neurological conditions plus friends, family and carers. ""I was thinking of all the things which I wished I'd done with my life and I wouldn't be able to do. And then I started thinking about all the things that I still actually could do and singing was one of those,"" Temple told CNN. Along with a fellow Parkinson's sufferer, Temple decided, on a whim, to form a choir. The pair placed notices in doctor's surgeries inviting others to join them and advertised for a singing teacher. By 2003, with the help of funding from the Parkinson's Disease Society, the resulting ensemble ""Sing For Joy"" was up and running, rehearsing weekly and soon graduating to public performances. The group now consists of around two dozen singers, including sufferers of Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis, others recovering from conditions including stroke or cancer, plus their carers, family and friends. Led by acclaimed jazz performer Carol Grimes, the group's genre-defying repertoire ranges from Cole Porter classics to ethnic punk.  Watch Sing for Joy perform » . ""It's quite easy to get overwhelmed by the disease and having something that you do every week that makes you forget all your troubles and keeps you from feeling isolated is a great pleasure,"" says Temple. But singing also has physical and neurological benefits for the choir's members. A common symptom of Parkinson's disease and similar conditions is voice loss and each week the group begins its rehearsals with vocal exercises worked out with speech therapists. ""All neurological conditions affect the throat because it has so many muscles,"" says Sarah Benton, another choir member with multiple sclerosis. ""So singing, which makes you lift up your body and expand your lungs, is perfect for neurological diseases."" While ""Sing for Joy's"" DIY-style music therapy has provided obvious social, mental and physical benefits for its members, there is a growing body of clinical evidence suggesting that music can play a key role in aiding recovery or helping sufferers cope with a broad range of brain-based conditions. Does music affect your mood or have particular physical or mental benefits? Sound Off below . Doctor Wendy Magee, International Fellow in Music Therapy at London's Institute of Neuropalliative Rehabilitation, describes music as a ""mega-vitamin for the brain,"" capable of influencing and improving motor function, communication and even cognition. ""When neural pathways are damaged for one particular function such as language, musical neural pathways are actually much more complex and much more widespread within the brain,"" Magee told CNN. ""Music seems to find re-routed paths and that is why it is such a useful tool in terms of helping people with different kinds of brain damage because it can help to find new pathways in terms of brain functioning."" Researchers in Finland have demonstrated that listening to music for several hours a day can enhance the rehabilitation of stroke patients. In another study, stroke patients who were taught to play the piano or drums made speedier progress in their general recovery than patients who received only traditional therapy. At Colorado State University, researchers have used musical and rhythmic cues as an effective tool to improve the movement and balance of Parkinson's disease sufferers and those with other degenerative diseases. Melodic Intonation Therapy, in which musical exercises are used to improve speech, has proved an effective treatment for patients with aphasia, a disorder that results from damage to portions of the brain responsible for language. Musical memories also seem to be more resilient to neural degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and dementia, enabling therapists to use familiar tunes to cue memories which might otherwise have been lost. One American World War II veteran whose dementia was so severe he couldn't remember his own name and would barely acknowledge his own wife was brought alive through ballroom dancing and the music of Frank Sinatra, the sufferer still able to lead his wife through the foxtrot as if it was the 1940s. The power of music to enhance moods and emotions has long been harnessed by psychologists, but, as Dr. Lauren Stewart, director of a recently established course in Music, Mind and Brain at Goldsmiths University of London told CNN, ""recent advances in neuroscience and brain imaging technology are now radically transforming conventional music therapy into a more rigorous and research-based clinical practice."" Professor Michael Thaut of Colorado State University's Center for Biomedical Research in Music, who has helped pioneer a new research-based approach known as Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT), says recent developments amount to a ""paradigm shift."" ""Therapists in all fields have been doing things for decades; now they're trying to figure out the research to support their work,"" Thaut told CNN. ""NMT started as a science and now it's turning into a clinical field. And that's very exciting."" For now NMT remains on the fringes of standard neurological rehabilitation. But Magee believes its application and a general move away from psychoanalytical approaches dominant in the past, could bring music therapy towards the mainstream and make it an ever more effective tool. ""We are now starting to see the evidence for why we see things work. That also means we can fine tune what we do because we understand more about the neurological processing behind it,"" she said. ""But we're still at the point where we need to build the evidence base and translate that evidence base into practice so we can convince funders that music therapy is an important part of rehab practice."" For the members of Sing For Joy however, the proof of the therapeutic power of music is already self-evident. ""There is something about coming together and making a communal sound,"" said Sarah Benton. ""There is nothing like it and it's wonderful.""","London choir is made up of sufferers of neurological conditions, friends and carers .

"(CNN) -- With a few quick strokes of a pen this week, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva signed into law a widely debated measure that aims to end hundreds of years of racial disparity. Whether the Racial Equality Law will succeed in a nation where about the half the population consists of people of color, but most of the political and economic power resides in white hands, will not be known for years. Some observers say the law will just make matters worse because the inequalities in the nation of more than 201 million people are economic and social, not racial. ""It makes Brazil do what Brazil has never done, which is racialize the debate,"" said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Institute for Scholars.  ""The way to face it is not to define who is this or who is that, but to create opportunities."" About 54 percent of Brazilians are white, 39 percent are mixed race and 6 percent are black, according to the CIA World Factbook. But those distinctions are lost on most Brazilians, Sotero and others say. ""I have black ancestors, indigenous ancestors, Portuguese ancestors, and I personally don't give a damn,"" Sotero said. That's not to say that huge inequalities don't exist. The country's Gross Domestic Product -- the value of goods and services it produces -- was $2 trillion in 2009, the 10th largest in the world, according to the CIA World Factbook. But per capita income for the same year was estimated at $10,200, the 105th highest in the world. Simply stated, most of the wealth being produced is not finding its way down to most Brazilians. It's people of color who bear the brunt of that inequality. Brazilians of African descent earn 58 cents for every $1 a white Brazilian makes, according to the government's National Household Survey. This in a country where one of every four Brazilians lives below the poverty level. ""The poor generally have darker skin,"" Sotero said. But that's not because blacks are considered inherently inferior, but because they haven't had the opportunities, analysts say. ""The country really favors a meritocracy,"" said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a liberal Washington think tank. ""If you had the talent and you had the education, you could succeed,"" Birns said. ""It just so happened that most of the time the whites had the education."" Peter Hakim, president emeritus of the Inter-American Dialogue policy institute, notes that ""if people move up the social ladder, they're not viewed by a racial prism."" Much discrimination has been based on economic class, not race. ""It's a class and social issue that sometimes expresses itself as racial,"" Sotero said. ""I'm not saying there is no racism. Yes, there is,"" he said. ""But in Brazil there is no racial hatred."" Birns recalls that rich people would place ads in newspapers years ago seeking husbands for their daughters. The ads would note that ""race need not matter,"" he said. ""The rich weren't particularly scornful of the blacks,"" Birns said. ""They simply were scornful of those who were poor."" Still, though, people of color have faced barriers -- physical and otherwise. ""Not long ago,"" Hakim said, ""black people were required to use the service entrance to buildings. Now, that's not so."" The Brazilian Senate approved the Racial Equality Statute in June and Lula signed it Tuesday. Senators removed provisions for racial quotas in universities and businesses, but the law offers tax incentives for enterprises that undertake racial inclusion, the Globo newspaper reported Wednesday. The law also defines what constitutes racial discrimination and inequality and says that anyone who considers himself or herself a black or mulatto is covered. In addition, the law stipulates that African and Brazilian black history be taught in all elementary and middle schools. Brazil will hold elections for a new president in October and some observers see adoption of the racial equality law as one of the last pieces of unfinished business before Lula leaves office. ""The law is one of a number of things that Lula has done to face up to various Brazilian dilemmas,"" Birns said. ""He has placed issues on the agenda that previously had difficulty being there."" Enactment of the measure shows how far the country has come, Hakim said. ""Until 10 or 12 years ago,"" he said, ""Brazil was very sensitive about race. Now Brazil has begun to feel a little more relaxed about the whole thing."" And the law is significant, Hakim said, because Brazil now is ""willing to admit racial discrimination."" Observers emphasize it would be a mistake to compare the racial situation in Brazil with the United States. For starters, the definition of who is black is significantly different. ""In the United States, a person who has one drop of black blood is considered black,"" Sotero said, pointing out that President Barack Obama is labeled as black although his mother was white. ""In Brazil, it's just the opposite,"" he said. ""A person who has one drop of white blood is considered not black."" Brazil's initial pool of African natives also was much larger than in the United States. About 900,000 slaves survived the trip from Africa to the United States, Sotero said, while 3.7 million slaves made it to Brazil. The sheer weight of that many slaves made them a larger part of Brazilian society, he said. Slavery became illegal in the United States in 1865 when Congress passed the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, while Brazil outlawed slavery in 1888. Sotero sees a major difference in the aftermath in the two countries, though, because much of the racism in the United States was codified into laws that were not overturned until the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 100 years after the end of the Civil War. ""There were no JIm Crow laws in Brazil, officially,"" Sotero said. ""There was prejudice, but it was not categorized in law."" Says Hakim, ""Brazil has a longer history of the two races living side by side."" Compared with the United States, he said, ""the difference between blacks and whites in Brazil was never that dramatic."" As a result, he said, there's a big difference in how African descendants see themselves in each country. ""Blacks in the United States recognize themselves mostly as being black first,"" he said. ""In Brazil, they see themselves as being black and Brazilian. ""In the United States, race tends to be all-determining. It's not the same in Brazil. There's lots of discrimination, but not this all-too-determining factor."" But Brazil's new law could increase racial tensions, Sotero said, because people could start thinking more in those terms. ""It's a very controversial measure because it mandates that people identify themselves as black or white,"" he said. ""Most Brazilians would have difficulties to put themselves in a category."" Or the law could turn out to be meaningless. ""One of the things that could happen with it is nothing,"" he said. ""There are many laws in Brazil that are not fully implemented because there are no resources."" Regardless, Hakim said, passage of the law carries weight. ""Laws always have two sides,"" he said. ""There's the symbolic side. Progress is always slower."" Sotero agrees. ""Now we have to implement the law and see what happens.""","Brazil's problems are social and economic, not racial, some analysts say .
Many Brazilians don't think in racial terms, the analysts say .
Nearly half of all Brazilians are people of color .
The income gap between whites and people of African descent is nearly 2 to 1 ."
"(CNN) -- Surrounded by expensive pieces of Chinese art purchased from auction houses in London and New York, Wang Zhongjun, China's 50-year old film mogul, appears the very model of a modern Chinese entrepreneur. Luxuriating with his wealth, Wang explains that all the success, money and pieces of art he has gathered thanks to his film and TV production company, Huayi Brothers Media, wasn't very carefully planned. ""Our [company] goals weren't very clear so and we didn't know if it was a good idea or not [to make films]. Maybe we didn't find it difficult because our goals weren't clear,"" he told CNN. Wang founded Huayi Brothers Media group with his youngest brother Wang Zhonglei in 1994, originally doing advertising commissions. It morphed into a film production company in 1998 and Wang and his brother haven't looked back. It has grown to become perhaps China's most influential film producer with over 50 films released, most of them huge box office hits in China. The company also produces numerous TV shows and represents most of China's top acting talent. The opulence and attention Wang is now accustomed to -- ""people want to know me, hoping to find success and to meet famous people"" -- is a long way from when he worked in the U.S. delivering pizzas. Two years after returning to China he says he was making millions of dollars, something his friends back in the U.S. couldn't believe. ""They thought I was joking. Now everybody knows how fast business is growing in China,"" said Wang. While tiny in comparison to Hollywood, China's film and cinema industry is enjoying something of a boom and Wang is bullish about China's homegrown market. ""The media tends to think film companies aren't good business or aren't likely to grow,"" he says. To make sure it does grow and audiences can see their films, Huayi Brothers Media are planning on building almost 200 cinemas this year in China; a country where DVDs, mostly pirated copies, are still the main source of film-watching. ""China does have a big problem with intellectual property protection,"" says Wang. ""Knowing that intellectual property is not well protected, we need to make sure our main income comes from the box office -- follow up products won't generate much income."" Changing the types of films as well as the film-watching experience is also on Wang's agenda. After over 50 releases, Wang believes his company has gone some way to update the face of Chinese cinema. ""Everybody followed what was considered to be a successful model like Kung Fu films. In recent years though, Chinese films have begun to prosper. Our company started making films that haven't been made before, like war films, spy films, comedies and disasters,"" he said. While keeping ticket sales high and collaborating with U.S. big hitters like Sony and Disney, Wang still has an eye on what's important, namely making films people want to see. ""The most important thing is, regardless if it's an American or a Chinese company; we have to make good films to keep our audience happy,"" he said.","Wang Zhongjun is one half of siblings who run China's Huayi Brothers Media company .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has criticized the timing of the U.S. drone strike that killed the leader of the Pakistani Taliban last week, his office said in a statement. Karzai made the comments when he met with a U.S. congressional delegation in Kabul on Sunday evening, the statement said. The Afghan President expressed hope that the death of the Pakistani Taliban leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, would not undermine cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan aimed at achieving a successful peace process. Mehsud, who had a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head for his alleged involvement in a 2009 attack on a U.S. base in Afghanistan, was killed Friday in a drone strike in northwestern Pakistan, senior U.S. and Pakistani officials said last week. The Pakistani government condemned the use of drone strikes on its territory after Mehsud's killing. The U.S. ambassador to Islamabad was summoned to Pakistan's Foreign Ministry on Saturday. Mehsud's death happened as Pakistani authorities were working on efforts to hold peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban. There are fears that his killing could jeopardize the proposed talks. In a different initiative, the Afghan government announced plans last week to send a delegation to Pakistan to meet with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a former Afghan Taliban leader who was released last month from detention by Pakistani authorities. The planned visit plays into efforts to pursue peace in war-torn Afghanistan, where NATO and Afghan troops have been fighting the Afghan Taliban for more than a decade. The Afghan Taliban condemned the drone strike that killed Mehsud as ""cowardly"" and ""barbaric"" in a statement posted on their website Saturday, the SITE intelligence group said. The statement urged the Pakistani government and people to take measures to stop the attacks. The Pakistani Taliban have voted to elect Asmatullah Shaheen, who is on Pakistan's most wanted list, as their interim head, an official for the group said. The group, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, will not be making an announcement on a new permanent leader for several more days, according to Azam Tariq, a member of the Pakistani Taliban's Shura Council, their centralized decision-making body.","Karzai says he hopes the killing of Hakimullah Mehsud won't hurt cooperation with Pakistan .

"(CNN) -- The financial crisis has driven a wedge through Europe, with two economies emerging and -- more dangerously -- a psychological split between the north and the south, European leaders have told CNN. Jean-Claude Trichet, former president of the European Central Bank, Mario Monti, former prime minister of Italy, and Joaquin Almunia, EU competition commissioner, joined CNN's Richard Quest to debate if the crisis had fractured the region, both economically and socially. Trichet, who headed France's Banque de France before joining the ECB, said a two-speed economy was emerging, but that could be seen as a ""major rebalancing."" When he began at the ECB in 2003, Germany was the sick man of Europe due to its lack of competitiveness, Trichet said. The country has since emerged as the eurozone's power player, and a lead negotiator in the four-year old financial crisis. According to Trichet, Europe has been adjusting after ""countries that went too far too rapidly, had bubbles and so forth...now those countries that were growing extremely fast, abnormally fast, [and] a lot of them are correcting."" However, member countries are not always going at the ""same time, at the same speed,"" Trichet said. Monti who stepped up as Italy's ""technocrat"" prime minister after the country's economic instability forced the resignation of Silvio Berlusconi, told Quest his greater concern was the prospect of a two class Europe. READ MORE: Could euroskeptics spoil Angela Merkel's party? ""The crisis has been managed very, very poorly in my view as regards the psychology, and the eurozone crisis has generated a backlash against integration,"" Monti said. This ""psychological conflict of north versus south and vice versa, this needs to be tackled."" Trichet echoed the concerns, telling Quest such a split was ""absolutely unacceptable."" ""If we had, in the past, fully implemented the rules including the stability and growth pact, and what was badly needed -- control and monitoring of competitiveness -- we wouldn't have two class Europe,"" he said. Almunia, meanwhile, said his fear was that ""after the crisis those who were, at the beginning of this crisis, at the bottom, would continue to be at the bottom."" However, he added, that would not happen if the countries in recession ""do what they have started to do and ....continue to do [it]."" Germany's emergence as power player . Germany emerged as an economic force after labor reforms were implemented under its then-chancellor Gerhard Schroder. Now, its export-led economy drives the 17-nation eurozone, with Chancellor Angela Merkel -- battling for third term in this weekend's federal elections -- a central figure during Europe's crisis. Merkel's popularity remains high in Germany, and her party, the Christian Democratic Union, is expected to gain the most votes. Merkel's leadership during the crisis saw her named as the world's most powerful woman by Forbes three years in a row. Efforts to combat the crisis included the implementation of bailout funds, closer fiscal cooperation and austerity measures. READ MORE: It's the economy, Dummkopf . When asked if Germany is taking over Europe, Monti replied that the continent's largest economy would have more dominance if it had retained the deutsche mark ""because they would then become the only relevant monetary policy power in Europe."" As it is, Germany remains shackled to the weaker countries in the euro, many of which continue to struggle with spiralling unemployment, high national debts and growing political instability. Greece, Portugal, Cyprus and Ireland have received over 400 billion euros ($534 billion) in bailout packages from the euro-area's rescue funds. Last year European finance ministers approved a 39.5 billion euro ($51.6 billion) lifeline for Spain's banks, struggling after the property bubble went bust. Yet Spain and Greece still have unemployment above 27%. Portugal and Ireland are also struggling with chronic unemployment. Anti-austerity protesters in the worst-hit nations have held demonstrations against government cuts and the lack of jobs, with many turning violent. And Eurostat's 2013 growth forecasts for eurozone nations show a growing chasm between the region's prosperous north and its struggling south. READ MORE: German Finance Minister, on the campaign trail . Germany is expected to post 0.4% growth this year while all the Mediterranean countries' economies are likely to contract. The imbalance had created a system ""where the creditor nations rule and impose their conditions and the others are subservient to that,"" Paul de Grauwe, a professor at the London School of Economics, told CNN. ""At some point, these countries will not continue to accept this recipe."" The common currency's future . Public opinion continues to support the political push to integrate the eurozone, Almunia said. Discontent shown by the region's constituents is ""with the way the European institutions tried to solve the problems,"" he said. Indeed, despite efforts to tie the bloc closer, debate continues around the potential for worst affected countries to exit the common currency. Such an outcome has been decried in the past but could, according to European School of Management and Technology faculty member Jan Hagen, be of benefit. Hagen said the bloc needed to ""go for strong political integration, to basically create a single market or a strong fiscal policy, or get rid of the euro. "" Otherwise, Hagen said, ""my fear is .... people in these countries that have problems will turn violently against Europe."" Meanwhile, according to Monti, the region's leaders must work more closely together. Leaders who applaud decisions made in Brussels only to criticize them from home turf are playing a dangerous game, he said. ""This Europe bashing is, of course, very dangerous... because it's simply a dishonest game of shifting the responsibility where it does not belong,"" Monti told Quest. And, as Trichet noted during the debate: ""This is no time for complacency for Europe... it's absolutely clear we have very hard work to do, very, very hard work, and things will remain difficult for a while."" Richard Quest, Oliver Joy and Irene Chapple contributed to this report .","The crisis has driven a wedge through Europe, with two economies emerging and a psychological split, leaders say .

"(CNN) -- Just along the river from London's economic heart -- the City of London -- lies the O2 Arena, which over the last week has hosted a tennis tournament which has had record crowds as fans forget about the economic gloom that has gripped both Britain and Europe over the last few years. ""When people are not doing very well, they need something to entertain them and this is a great distraction,"" said Dakin Sloss, a tennis fan from Silicon Valley in California, who attended the ATP World Tour finals. Place a five kilometer ring around the now iconic setting, which was specially constructed to herald the arrival of the 21st Century, and within it would fall inner London boroughs where unemployment is well into double digits, double that for the under 25s, and deprivation is very apparent. Britain officially crept out of its double dip recession last quarter, but like much of the Europe, is gripped by the consequences of sluggish growth and demand. Dire outlook . But within the O2 Arena's confines there is no sense of austerity. When the ATP World Tour Finals came to the British capital for the first time in 2009, arguably the economic outlook was even more dire, but during its fourth staging this year the tournament celebrated its millionth paying customer and in many ways is a beacon for the heady success currently being enjoyed by tennis despite the global downturn. But it's not just London, coming off unprecedented attendances at the 2012 Olympics, and with their own ""home town"" global superstar in the form of Andy Murray, where tennis has pulled in the big revenues. ""The ATP and its 62 tournaments are now generating more than half a billion dollars annually,"" Brad Drewett, the tour's executive chairman and president, told CNN. ""We are in our strongest financial position ever and we have the biggest and best group of corporate partners ever involved in the game,"" he added. Increased revenues . According to the ATP, commercial revenues have increased 165 per cent since 2009 and during finals week, Ricoh extended its support while the big announcement saw title sponsor Barclays put its name to the tournament through 2015 with London confirmed as the venue in a two-year extension. Six-time grand slam champion Boris Becker believes that the global appeal of the sport has helped it ride the economic storm. ""You have great stars in a truly international sport, not based on one continent, and whether you are from Asia, Africa, the Americas or Europe, you have your favorites,"" said Becker, who is working for Barclays on their Ball Kids initiative. ""Tennis has a long history, we have survived wars and many different kinds of problems and in difficult times we come through, ""Becker added. Attendances on the ATP have remained steady at 4.4 million each year since 2009, excluding the four grand slams and Davis Cup matches, and television audiences have increased, with 800 million viewers plus four millions visitors to the official ATP Tour website each month. Neil Harman, tennis correspondent of The Times of London, believes the rivalry at the top of the men's game, with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal being joined by Murray to form an invincible ""Big Four"", is responsible for the sport's resilience in the face of difficult times. Golden opportunity . ""Tennis has this golden opportunity with the players you have got at the top of the game. We didn't have that five years ago,"" the Times journalist told CNN. And it's not just the men's game that is on an upward trajectory. ""I have just come from Istanbul (venue for the season-ending WTA Championships) where the semifinal and final saw 16 and a half thousand people crammed inside the stadium."" ""The fact is that women's tennis has two iconic figures at the top in Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova -- it's a potent combination."" The success of the respective men's and women's tours is matched and in many ways surpassed by the four grand slams, with ambitious expansion plans in place for Roland Garros, home of the French Open, and Flushing Meadows, which stages the U.S. Open. Prize money increases . The Australian Open, first on the calendar in January, recently announced record prize money of $30.68 million for 2013, up by $4.13m. The eight singles players and top eight doubles pairings in London will share out $5.5 million between them, rising to $6.5 million by 2014, but the likes of Djokovic and Federer, who is president of the ATP Player Council, flexed their industrial muscle this year to demand a more equitable share out of the cash at the slams for lower ranked players. There was fleeting talk of a strike ahead of the Australian Open if demands were not met and the issue remains a cloud on the horizon on an otherwise sunny sky. ""The future is incredibly bright for men's tennis,"" foresees Drewett, a 54-year-old Australian, who was a former top 40 player himself. The ATP World Tour Finals is the icing on the cake at the end of a long season, with qualification in the singles and doubles the main goal for the game's elite when they begin their 10-month season. Permanent home . It's essentially the fifth grand slam and both Becker and Harman believe it will benefit from finding a permanent home in London, extended past 2015. ""It's absolutely astonishing what has been achieved, what they have done with the stadium, the players all love it,"" said Harman. Former grand slam finalist Greg Rusedski, working for British television at the event, agreed. ""I made two appearances in this tournament in Hanover in the 1990s but this has moved on to another level."" ""They have sought to find a proper home for this event,"" said Harman. ""And there's not been a proper home since Madison Square Garden in the 1980s."" Becker would like to see a permanent move: ""Tennis is a sport which needs consistency and the reason the grand slams are so successful is everyone knows that at a certain time of the year in a certain place the big stars will turn up,"" he said. Rusedski can also see no reason to move while the Paris Masters occupies its present place in the calendar. ""Players will not want to travel to Rio de Janiero, which has been touted as venue, at the end of a long season,"" he said. Special setting . It's a potent mix of setting and razzmatazz which defines the O2 experience for the crowd, with players emerging like gladiators to loud music and special effects. From Rihanna to Rafael Nadal: Tennis' popstar makeover . Once the action is underway the crowd is kept in darkness, similar to watching a football match under floodlights, but they are kept in touch with match statistics and disputed line call replays on a giant four-sided screen above the court.

"(CNN) -- Microsoft's purchase of Nokia's mobile phone business will allow the company to compete against ""big established players"" by being ""agile and clear"" with the consumer and with its innovations, its outgoing chief executive Steve Ballmer has told CNN. The deal, announced late Monday night, pits Microsoft squarely against Apple and Google in the hotly-contested smartphone arena. The $7.2 billion purchase gives Microsoft control of the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world, according to IDC. Watch more: Microsoft to buy Nokia's phone business .

"(CNN) -- Oprah Winfrey says she's sorry for the media storm that erupted after she recounted that she was the victim of racism in a posh Swiss boutique. Winfrey's revelation last week on Entertainment Tonight led to the upscale store being identified as Trois Pommes in Zurich and its staff was immediately caught up in a frenzy of media interest. The manager of the boutique, Trudie Goetz, subsequently told CNN the entire incident was a ""200 percent misunderstanding"" and had nothing to do with racism. Speaking at the Los Angeles premiere of Lee Daniels' ""The Butler,"" Monday, Winfrey said the situation had been blown out of proportion. ""I think that incident in Switzerland was just an incident in Switzerland. I'm really sorry that it got blown up,"" she said. ""I purposely did not mention the name of the store. I'm sorry that I said it was Switzerland. ""I was just referencing it as an example of being in a place where people don't expect that you would be able to be there."" 'No apology needed' On Entertainment Tonight, Winfrey recounted how she had asked to see a $38,000 handbag, but the shop assistant refused to show it to her because it was ""too expensive."" Winfrey explained Monday that for her, racism is not usually overt. ""Nobody is going to come and call me the N-word to my face, unless they are a thug on Twitter or Facebook,"" she said. ""It shows up for me differently, it shows up (when) I'm in a store and the person doesn't obviously know that I carry the 'black card' and so they make an assessment based upon the way I look and who I am."" It appears Winfrey is referring to the exclusive American Express Centurion card, which is issued by invitation only to an exclusive group of the rich and famous. Winfrey said she was dressed in a Donna Karan skirt and top but was not wearing obvious symbols of wealth such as diamond jewelry or designer shoes. ""You should be able to go into a store looking like whatever you look like and say 'I would like to see this' -- and that didn't happen,"" she said. Has something like this happened to you? But while she stood by it as an example, Winfrey cautioned against reading too much into the specific incident. And she rejected any idea that Switzerland should be asked to apologize to her. ""It's not an indictment against the country or even that store,"" she said. ""It was just, you know, one person who didn't want to offer me the opportunity to see the bag. So no apology necessary from the country, from Switzerland!"" In her latest film, Winfrey plays the wife of the main character -- portrayed by Forest Whitaker -- who serves as a butler in the White House. Winfrey's claim 'absurd,' clerk says . Meanwhile, the store clerk concerned told Swiss daily newspaper Blick, in an interview printed Sunday, that she felt ""terrible"" and had not been able to sleep for days. The woman, who gave her name as Adriana N. because she said she didn't want to be hassled on the street, said, ""I feel as if I'm in the middle of a whirlwind. Totally powerless, as if everything's been taken from me. It's a horror, what's happened."" Adriana, from Italy, said she had asked her manager if she should resign, but that Goetz had stood by her. Asked to give her version of the incident, Adriana said Winfrey had come into the store and was looking at bags when her eye was caught by a $38,000 crocodile skin number by Tom Ford. She told the newspaper, ""I explained that this was exactly the same bag as the one I had in my hand. Only much more expensive. I would happily show her other bags, I said."" Adriana said Winfrey's claim that she told the media mogul the bag was too expensive for her was absolutely not true. ""That's absurd. I would never say such a thing to a customer. Absolutely not. Good manners and politeness are everything in this shop,"" she said. The store assistant added that she hadn't recognized Winfrey but that it would not have made a difference in any case. ""We make a huge effort to treat everyone with the same respect and in the same way,"" she said. CNN's Mark Thompson contributed to this report.","Oprah Winfrey says she's sorry that a Swiss store got caught up in a media frenzy .

"(EW.com) -- It's taken over two decades for Orson Scott Card's classic sci-fi novel ""Ender's Game"" to make it to the big screen, but all the built-up anticipation didn't lead to out-of-this-world box office numbers. The film adaptation debuted with $28 million from 3,407 theaters on its first weekend â€” a start in the same range as Will Smith's misfire ""After Earth,"" which opened with $27.5 million earlier this year. Summit and OddLot Entertainment spent $110 million on the space adventure starring Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford, but ""Ender's Game"" will need great legs domestically and strong returns overseas to justify its cost (and any potential sequels). Movie review: 'Ender's Game' Of course, the film didn't bomb the way other YA-adaptations like ""The Host,"" ""Beautiful Creatures"" or ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" have recently, but its opening was nowhere near the debuts of ""Twilight"" or ""Hunger Games,"" both of which had less expensive first editions than ""Ender's Game."" Notably, both of those films targeted young women primarily, while ""Ender's Game's"" audience was 58 percent male and 54 percent above the age of 25. Crowds issued the film an average ""B+"" CinemaScore grade. ""Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa"" held up very nicely in second place, dropping just 36 percent to $20.5 million. That is by far the smallest second-weekend drop for any of the ""Jackass"" films, and it gives Paramount's $15 million prank comedy a $62.1 million total after ten days. If ""Bad Grandpa"" continues to maintain great holds at the box office, it could exceed $100 million total. Take that, Oscar season! Third place belonged to CBS Films' ""Last Vegas,"" which opened with $16.5 million in 3,065 theaters. The film, which stars Morgan Freeman, Robert DeNiro and Michael Douglas, opened ahead of last year's ""Hope Springs,"" another film targeting the oft-ignored 45+ demographic, which started with $14.7 million on the way to $63.5 million total. Movie review: 'Last Vegas' Thanks to strong word-of-mouth and an ""A-"" CinemaScore grade, older audiences may flock to the theater gradually over the next few weeks and push ""Vegas'"" total as high as $60 million. For a humble $28 million comedy, that's a lot like hitting the jackpot. ""Free Birds"" started in fourth place with $16.2 million, and though the film wasn't a total turkey, its box office left a lot to be desired. Relativity's $55 million animated entry, which features the voice of Amy Poehler, opened in an ultra-wide 3,736 theaters with virtually no family competition (""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" arrived six weeks ago), but it could only muster a $4,336 per theater average. On the bright side, ""Free Birds"" did spike 82 percent from Friday to Saturday, which suggests that it is playing well with young tots during matinee shows, and it should hold up well as Thanksgiving approaches â€” especially with an ""A-"" CinemaScore. It may earn back its budget yet. Movie review: 'Free Birds' Rounding out the Top 5 was ""Gravity,"" which pulled in another $13.1 million in its fifth weekend. Warner Bros.' $100 million space drama starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney has now earned $219.1 million total and, with a little awards attention, should ultimately hit about $250 million domestically. 1. ""Ender's Game"" -- $28 million . 2. ""Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa"" -- $20.5 million . 3. ""Last Vegas"" -- $16.5 million . 4. ""Free Birds"" -- $16.2 million . 5. ""Gravity"" -- $13.1 million . Outside the Top 5, ""12 Years A Slave"" continued its successful expansion this weekend. The Oscar contender jumped from 123 theaters into 410 locations and pulled in $4.6 million as a result. That gave the film an excellent $11,220 venue average, thus assuring it will continue to expand into more markets in the near future. Fox Searchlight could have a sleeper hit on their hands. On the international front, ""Thor: The Dark World"" hammered up a great debut this weekend. The film pulled in $109.4 million from 36 territories, which represents about 70 percent of the international market. The film performed best in the United Kingdom ($13.4 million), France ($9.4 million), and Mexico ($8.2 million), and it still has openings in China and Japan to look forward to. The original ""Thor"" grossed $268.3 million internationally in 2011, but after a major exposure-boost from ""The Avengers,"" ""The Dark World"" seems poised to easily outdo that film's overall performance.

"(CNN) -- Two Russian athletes issued angry denials Tuesday that their exchange of a kiss on the victory podium at the world championships was a protest against their country's strict new anti gay propaganda law. Kseniya Ryzhova and Yulia Gushchina were part of the Russian quartet who won the women's 4x400m relay Saturday in the Luzhniki Stadium, beating the favored United States team. All four embraced as they received their gold medals, but Ryzhova and Gushchina were pictured kissing each other on the lips, prompting reports that it was a symbol of defiance in face of the controversial new laws. Ryzhova told a media conference in Moscow that she and the three other members of the team had merely been overcome with emotion after finally topping the podium after a series of near misses. ""For eight years we have not won a gold medal. You can't even imagine what it was like, when we understood that we'd won,"" she said, addressing reporters in Russian. ""It was a wave of unbelievable feelings and if somehow, completely by chance, while we were congratulating each other, our lips touched, I don't know in whose fantasy this all gets thought up."" She added: ""Myself and Yulia are both married and we are not having any kind of relationship."" Earlier in the championships, Russia's pole vault gold medal winner Yelena Isinbayeva defended the new legislation, speaking in English at a press conference. ""If we allow to promote and do all this stuff on the street, we are very afraid about our nation because we consider ourselves like normal, standard people,"" Isinbayeva said. ""We just live boys with woman, women with boys."" She also criticized two Swedish competitors who had painted their fingernails with rainbows in support of gay rights, claiming them to be ""disrespectful."" Isinbayeva, an ambassador for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, later back tracked and said her comments had been ""misunderstood"" as English was not her first language. They prompted a storm of international criticism, but Gushchina claimed Tuesday that she had not been aware of the controversy. ""I simply did not hear or read about it because I was totally focused on my performance at the championships,"" she told gathered reporters. Both Russian athletes complained that the media spotlight on their kiss had taken the shine off their victory celebrations. ""These victories are hard to come by and we were happy. I don't understand how everything could be tarnished in such a way,"" Gushchina said. The legislation banning the promotion of ""gay propaganda"" among minors came on to the Russian statute book in June as Vladimir Putin embarks on his third term as president. It has prompted calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Games and the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which is also to be staged in Russia.","Russian athletes deny their 'kiss' was a symbol of gay defiance .

"(CNN) -- Alex Ferguson has endured many highs and lows in his 25 years at Manchester United, so perhaps it was fitting that Saturday's much-anticipated anniversary celebration featured some of both extremes. The Scot is the most successful manager in British football, and his status as the longest-serving one in United's history was cemented when the English Premier League champions renamed the biggest stand at Old Trafford in his honor. It is the first time in the ground's 101 years that a section has been named after an individual. Club officials have also commissioned an award-winning Scottish sculptor, Philip Jackson, to build a statue of the 69-year-old to be erected outside the stand's entrance next year. ""I was really emotional. I couldn't believe it. I didn't expect that. I have to thank the club, it's fantastic of them to do that,"" Ferguson told reporters after the nervy 1-0 victory over Sunderland. United he stands: The real Alex Ferguson . The match was won thanks to an own-goal by former United defender Wes Brown just before halftime, and kept United in second place in the table -- five points behind local rivals Manchester City, who battled to a 3-2 win at Queens Park Rangers in the late kickoff. Sunderland, managed by Steve Bruce -- whose headed goal against Sheffield Wednesday gave Ferguson his first of 12 English titles in the inaugural 1992-93 Premier League season -- almost spoiled the celebrations. Referee Lee Mason awarded the visitors a penalty in the 68th minute when his linesman Jake Collin flagged that young United defender Phil Jones had handled the ball, but then overturned the decision. ""That last 15 minutes was torture,"" Ferguson said. ""I'd have been quite happy if the whistle had gone at halftime when we were 1-0 up. Sunderland threw everything at us and played very well in that last 15 minutes."" Ferguson said the week's hype may have got to his team. ""It was an anxious day for the players. I think they showed that. They wanted to do well for me,"" he said. ""These occasions can be a wee bit like that. I remember the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster and we lost 2-0 to Manchester City. That got to the players that day. Maybe it happened a little bit today."" Bruce was at United for nine years as a player, but has yet to beat his former boss in 17 attempts as a manager. ""He welcomed me in with a great glass of wine and said, 'Unlucky again'. I'll be his age before I get a result here,"" Bruce said. ""But I have to say the tribute, naming the stand after him -- I've never known anything at Manchester United kept a secret. It's quite remarkable and fitting, too. ""I said to him maybe he's taken his finger off the pulse because he didn't know what was going on!"" However, Manchester City showed that United have a real challenge to add to Ferguson's long list of trophies after coming from behind the first time in the league this season to beat a QPR side that has already defeated Chelsea. Roberto Mancini's men crushed Villarreal 3-0 in the Champions League in midweek, but went behind in the 28th minute when striker Jay Bothroyd headed in Joey Barton's free-kick. Edin Dzeko leveled two minutes before halftime with his 10th league goal this season, with the Bosnia striker cutting inside defender Anton Ferdinand -- who is at the center of the racism allegations aimed at Chelsea's England captain John Terry -- and slotted in a low shot. City's playmaker David Silva showed his customary sublime control to take Dzeko's low cross and fire in at the near post seven minutes after the break, but QPR leveled on 69 when Bothroyd's header hit teammate Heidar Helguson in the back and deflected past wrongfooted goalkeeper Joe Hart. Yaya Toure followed up Wednesday's goal in Spain with another crucial strike as the Ivory Coast midfielder leaped high to head the 74th-minute winner, leaving promoted QPR in 12th place. Newcastle's impressive run continued with a 2-1 win at home to Everton that kept Alan Pardew's team three points clear of fourth-placed Chelsea. An own-goal from Everton defender Johnny Heitinga and a superb long-range shot from fullback Ryan Taylor put Newcastle 2-0 ahead by the half hour, while Jack Rodwell reduced the deficit in time added on at the end of the first period. Chelsea, still awaiting the outcome of the investigation into Terry's alleged comments by both police and the English FA, bounced back from two successive league defeats with a 1-0 victory at struggling Blackburn. Midfielder Frank Lampard scored his sixth goal this campaign to leave the home side in the bottom three, with defender Terry starting after being rested for the 1-1 European draw with Belgian side Genk on Tuesday. Liverpool missed the chance to move above fifth-placed Tottenham -- who travel to Fulham on Sunday -- after being held 0-0 by mid-table Swansea. Striker Andy Carroll hit the bar as Kenny Dalglish's team dropped points at home for the third match in a row, while the promoted Welsh side moved to 10th place. Arsenal joined Spurs and Liverpool on 19 points after a 3-0 win at home to West Brom, again inspired by Robin van Persie. The Dutchman responded to being named as a substitute in the midweek 0-0 draw with Marseille by scoring his league-leading 11th goal this season from close range in the 22nd minute. He then set up defender Thomas Vermaelen six minutes before halftime, and was involved in Mikel Arteta's 74th-minute strike as Arsene Wenger's team notched a fifth successive league victory. Aston Villa moved up to eighth on 15 points with a 3-2 victory at home to Norwich, which lifted Alex McLeish's team above the promoted visitors. Villa came from behind as Darren Bent canceled out Anthony Pilkington's 25th-minute opener, and Gabriel Agbonlahor pounced on a defensive error before setting up his strike partner's second goal on 62 -- which made Steve Morison's late effort a consolation for ninth-placed City.","Manchester United manager honored by renaming of club's main stand .

"Washington (CNN) -- The 2014 elections will continue what has become a staple in American politics: the survival of powerful political families. Bush. Carter. Nunn. Udall. Cheney. These are familiar names from a previous generation -- but also for a new one. When Liz Cheney announced her intention to become the next senator from Wyoming this year, she likely evoked voters' memories of her father, Dick Cheney, the former vice president. The same is true for two politicians in Georgia. Both the daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn and a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter will be on the 2014 ballot in the Peach State. Michelle Nunn is running for U.S. Senate, while state Sen. Jason Carter has launched a bid for governor -- jobs her father and his grandfather, respectively, once held. ""For their constituents and the American public, those names are a proven quantity, and as time goes on, you see that Americans look back at the history of our political system, and things seem better in hindsight,"" said Dan Mahaffee of the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress. ""It harkens back to a more collegial political era."" Candidates and family heritage . All over the country, candidates with such familiar names are either running for re-election or jumping into races and using their families' vast networks to anchor nascent campaigns. Take a look at the heritage of some of these candidates on the ballot in 2014: . • Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia is running for her state's open U.S. Senate seat. Her father, Arch A. Moore Jr., was governor of West Virginia for 12 years. • Sen. Mary Landrieu is running for re-election in Louisiana. Her father, ""Moon"" Landrieu, was once mayor of New Orleans and a brother, Mitch Landrieu, is now the city's mayor. • George P. Bush is running for Texas land commissioner. A member of one of America's great political dynasties, he's the grandson of former President George H.W. Bush and nephew of former President George W. Bush. • Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey is running for re-election. A member of one of the most dominant political families in the United States, Frelinghuysen can trace his roots back to four U.S. senators and Frederick Frelinghuysen, one of New Jersey's delegates to the Continental Congress. • Sen. Mark Pryor, who is running for re-election in Arkansas, is the son of former Sen. David Pryor. • Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, the son of a former congressman, is running for re-election. And so is a cousin, Tom Udall of New Mexico, also a U.S. senator. A 'ready-made Rolodex' ""You grow up around a business, you learn the ropes early,"" CNN contributor Paul Begala said. ""It is the same reason restaurants or hardware stores -- or junkyards -- have names like 'Sanford and Son.' "" Begala cites many benefits to running as the next in line in a political family, but two stand out: a thick skin and fund-raising. ""A politician's kid grows up hearing all kinds of awful things about Mom or Dad, and they learn that's not the end of the world,"" he said. ""Toughness matters in politics."" Begala said that relying on relatives' fund-raising networks also is unbelievably helpful for these candidates. Being a Cheney in Wyoming, a Bush in Texas or a Landrieu in Louisiana will open many doors -- and wallets. It is ""hard to estimate how much good President Bush 41's network did for Bush 43,"" Begala said. Mahaffee added, ""You are almost born with a ready-made Rolodex."" American dynasties from the early years on . The number of political families on the ballot in 2014 is nothing new. Since the outset of the United States, political families have dominated certain states, and many have risen to national prominence. The Adamses, with the nation's second president, John Adams, and sixth president, John Quincy Adams, were among the first political families. But certainly not the last. The Republican Tafts have long dominated Ohio politics, boasting three U.S. senators, a president, a governor and countless local positions. The Democratic Kennedy family has dominated politics in New England -- with a president, three presidential candidates, three senators, multiple congressmen and dozens of local elected positions. A 2012 study of the Kennedys' political dominance by the University of Minnesota found the family has logged more than 92 years in congressional service, a number that doesn't even count Joseph P. Kennedy III's recent term as a representative from Massachusetts. Then there are the obvious political families: the Bushes and Clintons. Between 1980 and 2008, a member of one of these families was either president or vice president. Bush and Clinton ""fatigue"" has even become a common term as speculation grows about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both eyeing a run at the presidency in 2016. So why do Americans, the same people who revolted against a monarchy in 1776, keep electing members of the same families? Some political watchers said the continuity these families bring can be comforting to voters, but the public also can sour on candidates who see themselves as anointed successors to their families' political power. Mahaffee, however, said the idea that voters are sick of political families is dispelled by the fact that so many of them exist. Do voters occasionally get sick of one family? Yes, he said. But on the whole, such a history is a good thing for candidates, he said. ""It is helpful that you continue to have generations that bring political experience with them,"" Mahaffee said. ""They have more of a knowledge (of) what it takes to be a political leader.""","A new generation from well-known political families will show up on the 2014 ballot .

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid mistakenly called out ""no"" Thursday when asked for his vote on the health care reconciliation bill, setting the chamber howling with laughter. Reid voted the wrong way when the clerk called for his vote, realized his error and quickly changed his vote to ""yes."" ""He did it again,"" someone said amid laughter. Reid, who spent months persuading fellow senators to vote ""yes"" on President Obama's top domestic priority, made the same mistake December 24 when voting on the original health care bill. His office said Reid made the gaffe because he was so focused on getting health care passed. What's fueling health care rage? The reconciliation measure, also known as the ""fixes"" bill, makes changes in the broader health care overhaul measure that Obama enacted Tuesday. The Senate had to vote again on health care after Republicans forced two minor provisions involving student loan funding to be stripped from the bill. The final vote was 56-43 for approval, after which it was sent to the House, which also passed the measure. The ""fixes"" bill now goes to Obama to be signed into law. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","Sen. Harry Reid mistakenly votes ""no"" on health care reconciliation bill .

"(CNN) -- Remember the pre-Web personal diary? It had a lock on it, and after writing your thoughts about the day, it stayed tucked in a drawer. You talked about dreams and disappointments and school and love, and sometimes you culled it for phrases in the love letter you agonized over for a week before leaving it in the mailbox or locker of your interest. The last thing you wanted was for someone else to read it, at least not until the beloved saw it and said, ""Yes."" Back in the old days, love wasn't social, it was private. Communication, not to mention courtship, seemed to take a long time. Hours of contact with the loved one alternated with days alone with your longing. Except for a close friend or two, you kept it secret until you were established as an ""item,"" and even then you maintained the border between private exchange and social identity as a couple. The medium of love -- the letter, the quiet walks, the rose, the kiss -- remained between you and your interest, and you didn't reproduce it for others. When you were apart, solitude hurt, but it made the time together all the more precious. Today, with the spread of social media, the pain of separation is over, and so is the exclusivity of love. As Facebook gets ready to go public and huge dollar amounts are discussed -- a $100 billion valuation, $5 billion in hoped-for sales, $100 per share, $1 billion in profits in 2011 -- CEO Mark Zuckerberg and others have a very specific vision of the future. Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, Zynga, Foursquare and all the other social media services coming and going are about changing, fundamentally and forever, the very nature of human experience. They want to socialize everything. Here is how Mark Pincus, founder of Zynga, the social network game developer, put it last year: ""In five years, everybody will always be connected to each other, instead of the web."" Zuckerberg repeated the point: ""If you look five years out . . . every industry is going to be rethought in a social way. And not just industries, but individuals, too ... And no matter where you go . . . we want to make it so that all those experiences can be social."" And when Time Magazine named Zuckerberg its Person of the Year, it summarized the goal of his company this way: ""Facebook wants to populate the wilderness, tame the howling mob and turn the lonely, antisocial world of random chance into a friendly world, a serendipitous world. You'll be working and living inside a network of people, and you'll never have to be alone again."" The vision doesn't just provide social contact as an option in your daily affairs. It's a requirementâ€”""everybody,"" ""always,"" ""every industry,"" ""all those experiences,"" ""never have to be alone."" The numbers back them up. In 2010 Facebook leapt from 337 million to 585 million users, with 7.9 new ones registered every second. Foursquare, the geolocation networking service, grew 3400% in 2010 and reached 10 million users by June 2011. Twitter logged 25 billion tweets in 2010 and teens with mobile devices ran up 3,339 text messages per month that year. More and more, it seems, every experience can be social, and pretty soon it will be social unless you become a hermit. Here's the thing. It's not just that social media doesn't cure loneliness, which surprised social psychologists, it's that love itself doesn't survive socialization. Genuine love is anti-social. If you write a love letter and leave it for her, but post it on Facebook, too, your feelings disperse. The sentiments in the letter spread too thinly, and if she sees them elsewhere she wonders, ""Hey, I thought your love was meant for me."" If she posts your letter on Facebook, you think the same thing. If both of you post the letter on Facebook, well, love itself wastes away, just as any noble, feeling-full statement does when it turns into an advertising jingle. If you call him on the phone and hear him say for the first time, ""I love you, too,"" then hang up and text 20 friends and update Facebook with, ""He said it!"" you may think that you are expanding and replenishing his declaration, but in truth you only deplete it. This is a moment to savor and ponder by yourself, to let it exist for a time on its own. Love can't run too swiftly or follow too many channels and last. Zuckerberg has noted that we are ""hard-wired"" to care about what other people think, to heed the interests and eyes of our companions. Maybe so, but that doesn't mean we should involve them in everything. That way leads to what Andrew Keen terms in an upcoming book, ""digital vertigo,"" the disorienting, enfeebling effect of social contact on personal experience. The faster you express your love and the more you share it with others, the less you do, in fact, love. We have gone from 'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day' to smiley face emoticons, from beauteous and painstakingly crafted one-to-one disclosures of love to quick and clichÃ©d postings of love for all to see and 'like.' Think of it this way: what great lover of the past, real or fictional -- Gatsby, Dante, Mark Antony, Penelope in Ithaca, Queen Victoria -- spotted the beloved for the first time and thought one second later, ""I can't wait to tell all my friends""?

"(CNN) -- When Julie Sidder's daughters were younger, her diaper bag was filled with coloring books, crayons, storybooks and little games in case one of them became restless. Now that Sidder's kids are 4 and 7, the diaper bag is gone, but the need for entertainment -- especially in restaurants -- is not, which is why two-thirds of the apps on Sidder's iPhone are for her children. ""People have always brought toys, or something to entertain their child, into restaurants and stores,"" says the mom, who lives in West Bloomfield, Michigan. ""Now we just have better technology."" Harried parents for years have relied on glowing electronic screens -- TVs, video games, computers -- to entertain children in the home. Now more and more parents are discovering smartphones' similar ability to engage squirmy kids at restaurants, in the car and anywhere else where youngsters grow bored. Almost half of the top 100-selling education apps in the iTunes App Store were for preschool or elementary-aged children in November 2009, according to a content analysis by the Joan Ganz Cooney Center, which promotes digital media technologies to advance children's learning. Expert Carly Shuler says the reason for this -- assuming the majority of 3- to 10-year-olds don't own their own phones -- is because adults are taking advantage of the smartphone's ability to act as a mobile learning or entertainment device for their children. Shuler, a fellow at the Joan Ganz Cooney Center (part of the Sesame Workshop) calls this phenomenon the ""pass-back"" effect -- as in parents passing their phones back to their bored kids. Shortly after the iPhone came out, Shuler said she noticed children as young as 3 years old playing with the shiny devices. ""I saw it on the subway, at the grocery store -- anywhere you'd see a parent and child interacting, really,"" she said. Even AT&T acknowledged this trend in the current commercial where Luke Wilson ""passes back"" a smartphone to a crying child in a restaurant, Shuler said. App developers have noticed and are creating kids' games for phones, even though they don't think toddlers are buying smartphones, she said. Almost all children in the U.S. have access to a mobile device, according to the Sesame Workshop. A 2007 study found that 93 percent of 6 to 9-year-olds had access to a cell phone in the home and more than 30 percent owned their own phone. Shuler said these number have only increased since the study was conducted. So how do such young children come to understand this new touchscreen technology? ""A child is not as afraid that they're going to break something or do something wrong [as adults are],"" Shuler said. ""They're more likely to pick [the phone] up and just play with it, which is the best way to learn."" Toddler Teasers is one of the apps Sidder downloaded for her 4-year-old daughter, Ava. Sidder said the educational app, which asks Ava to pick out certain shapes, is a fun learning tool the pair can play together. But Sidder says even the less educational apps on her iPhone, such as Disney Cover Styler, Red Carpet Dress Up and 7-year-old Ella's favorite, Shrek Cart, are teaching her kids hand-eye coordination and to be comfortable with technology. ""I don't use [the iPhone] to parent my child,"" she said. ""I use it to entertain them ... if they're on it an hour a week, that's a lot. When we're sitting at home, they're not playing on my phone. It's just something that they do when we're out."" Sidder acknowledges that some people think letting young children play with your phone is a bad thing. But those are usually the same people who complain about children running around a restaurant kicking and screaming, she said. The app market for kids has continued to grow at a rapid rate since the iLearn analysis was published six months ago, said Shuler. Shuler said her research has found that children's educational apps tend to cost less than apps for older children or adults. But the kids' games and other apps are only one reason iPhones and other smartphones are a hit with children, she said. ""When you look at the design of the iPhone ... the interface is very tactile and well suited to what a child naturally does,"" Shuler said. ""They think with their fingers. If they see something they like, they'll jab at it and touch it. And children love flipping things. If you flip the iPhone, something will happen. If you shake the iPhone, something will happen."" Take a look at some of the best-selling toys throughout the years, she said. Kids have always loved to play with toy telephones, toy lawn mowers, toy ovens and toy vacuum cleaners. ""They like to play with things their parents have,"" she said. ""Considering how much time parents spend on [their phones], it makes sense that kids would want them, too."" And it's not just smartphones -- kids enjoy playing and learning on any mobile electronic gadget, Shuler said. ""Take pictures with your kids,"" she said. ""Or pull out the calculator and ask your kid to help add up what the groceries are going to cost. These are really powerful devices."" Robin Orman of Waterford, Michigan, says her 1 year old entertains himself just by holding on to her cell phone, which is not a smartphone. Orman's 2-year-old daughter, on the other hand, already prefers a touchscreen device. Orman said her older daughter enjoys playing educational flashcard games and listening to music on her mother-in-law's iPhone. She likes to slide the pictures around, she added. ""I'd love an iPhone,"" Orman said. But, for now, ""it's just another one of those things [the kids] get to do at grandma's house.""","More parents are handing their smartphones to their kids to keep them entertained .

"(CNN) -- Air travel these days can feel designed to make a harried flier feel like nothing more than a piece of cargo. From the interminable security lines to boarding cattle calls, anonymity is the order of the day, and that often extends to the food court. In a sea of endless soft pretzel vendors, undistinguished subs and sad, wan salads, it's always a treat for a hungry traveler to come upon an airport that's serving food specific to its city. While the fare might not always be quite on par with what's served at these restaurants' in-town flagships--hey, it's hard to cook in an airport!--these 10 offer up the next best thing to a long layover, a rental car and a trip back through security. The Varsity, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport . ""What'll ya have, what'll ya have?"" Servers at this Atlanta institution have been singing out that chorus for 85 years now, and your answer at the F- or C-Gate airport outposts should be the same as it would be at the downtown drive-in: a chili-cheese dog and a fried peach pie. Pair it with a Varsity orange drink and board your flight full and happy. The Salt Lick, Austin-Berstrom International Airport . The heady scent of smoked meat beckons hungry travelers the moment they step off the plane, and plenty of people have even been known to get to the airport early to enjoy some pit-smoked (obviously not on premises) brisket and sausage. Of course, it's nowhere near the same experience as you'd get driving out to to their decades-old, cash-only, BYOB restaurant in the Texas Hill Country, it's a darned sight better than having no barbecue at all (plus the line may be just a smidge shorter). Interstate Bar-B-Que, Memphis International Airport . Where Salt Lick stands strong for Texas-style brisket and sausage, Jim Neely's joint makes the case for slow-smoked, sauce-smothered pork ribs, served up Memphis-style. Follow your nose, grab a heap of napkins, and build in a little extra time if you're planning to eat in (service can be as sloooowww as the cooking process). And don't skip the BBQ spaghetti. It's an only-in-Memphis treat that you owe yourself to try at least once. Tootsies Orchid Lounge, Nashville International Airport . Waylon Jennings, Patsy Cline, Willie Nelson and scores of other country legends got their start strumming and singing for customers at Tootsies Orchid Lounge. While the airport locale is miles away from the mini-chain's flagship behind Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, the same caliber of live performers grace the stage while travelers munch on their burgers (the food isn't anything to write home about). As with most of the town's honky tonks, there is no cover charge, but it's awfully good manners to toss a few bucks in the tip jar, especially if they take a request. Dooky Chase's Restaurant, Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport . Chef Leah Chase is often referred to as the ""Queen of Creole Cooking,"" and for good reason. Her versions of Louisiana classics like shrimp etouffee, red beans 'n' rice and catfish are considered definitive, and the airport renditions stand faithfully. While you owe it to yourself to visit the original Treme location, where you can take in Chase's astonishing collection of African-American art, her bowl of gumbo at the airport will let you know where yat. Obrycki's Restaurant and Bar, Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport . It's Bawlmer, hon! You gotta try a crabcake. Marylanders love few things more than debating the merits of various restaurants' renditions of their city's signature blend of lump crab meat, mayo, egg, seasonings (usually Old Bay) and just enough crumbs (either bread or saltines) to keep the whole mess together. Though the original Obrycki's, which had been slinging up crabby delights in Baltimore's Fell's Point since 1944, has closed, the BWI locale sticks pretty close to the formula that made the restaurant a Charm City classic. (You can also grab Obrycki's at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.) Gold Star Chili, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport . Where else in the world can you tell your significant other that you're just going to duck out for a three-way and have them ask if you can bring them back some extra crackers? Cincinnati natives will squabble 'til they're blue in the face over which chili parlor reigns supreme: Gold Star, Skyline, Empress or Dixie, but they'll all agree that this soupy, Greek-style chili is the single finest spaghetti topping, alongside handfuls of fluffy, shredded cheddar (three way), onions or beans (add one for a four-way) or all of the above (five way). Sop up any spare sauce with oyster crackers, or add a cheese coney (chili and cheese on a hot dog) for a perfect Queen City experience. Cowgirl Creamery/Acme Bread counter, San Francisco International Airport . If it's this seasonal and artisanal, it must be San Francisco. These two local legends team up to serve sandwiches that are not just excellent for airport eating, but worth wrapping up an extra to take take home. The cheese maker and baker take great care to source their ingredients from local farmers and purveyors, making this collaboration a perfect bite of the Bay Area. Tia Juanita's, Albuquerque International Sunport . Red or green? That's the state question, and it's ably answered by the New Mexico specialties served up at this airport food court counter. The question refers, of course, to the color of chiles -- served atop enchiladas, burritos (both standard and breakfast) and other regional delights. ""Christmas"" -- red and green together -- is also an acceptable answer, and the carne adovada (long-cooked, heavily-spiced pork) is a must for expats traveling through to less chile-centric destinations. National Coney Island Bar and Grill/Express, Detroit Metropolitan Airport . The Motor City takes its hot dogs as seriously as it takes its hot rods, and a Coney Island experience is a must. While the style isn't exclusive to this chain (there are more than 100 Coney Islands by name in the Detroit area), National Coney Island serves up a solid version of the grilled, natural-casing dog, nestled in a steamed bun, topped with all-meat beanless chili and chopped, sweet onions and a stripe or two of yellow mustard. It's a bit messy to eat on the run, so grab it and race on down to your gate to enjoy, or opt for one of the sit-down locations.","Get the Atlanta airport's finest chili-cheese dog and a fried peach pie .

"(CNN) -- Almost before the smoke had cleared at Pearl Harbor, he had enlisted to serve his country in the Army Air Forces. He viewed the war in the South Pacific through the bomb sight of a B-24 Liberator as a second lieutenant and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery. When he got home to Texas, he was eventually elected to Congress and served 34 years, including a term as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. But Jim Wright found out the other day he wasn't qualified to vote in the election in his home state. Wright, who no longer drives at 90, tried to get a voter card under a new Texas law and was told his expired driver's license and university lecturer's ID were not adequate proof of his identity. A war hero and former congressman had to go home and dig through old files to return with his birth certificate. Hurrah for the flag of the free? Although there has been only one indicted incident of voter fraud in Texas since 2000, Gov. Rick Perry and the GOP-controlled legislature passed a stringent voter ID law. Perry had argued impersonators jeopardized the sanctity of elections. There had been, however, only four such cases on file with the Texas attorney general from 2008 to 2010, a brief time span during which 13 million people cast ballots. That data had much to do with the federal courts tossing out the Texas ID law as discriminatory against minorities. But a Supreme Court ruling on the Voting Rights Act immediately reinstated the Texas ID law -- which by design was intended to discriminate, as a lower court said. Texas conservatives and other states pushing voter ID laws are facing demographic destinies they cannot avoid. The laws of mathematics might have prompted the laws of discrimination. According to U.S. Census Bureau figures, in 1990, white children younger than 18 outnumbered Latinos in Texas by 843,000. The 2010 numbers were an almost exact reversal with 995,000 more Hispanic kids than whites. Assuming new Hispanic voters will follow familiar trends and tend to vote for Democrats, the end of the story for the GOP might just be biology. The average white female in Texas, and the rest of the country, is 41 with a fertility rate of 1.9, according to Census Bureau figures and and the Texas state demographer Lloyd Potter. The Latina female average age, meanwhile, is 25 with a fertility rate of 2.7. No need to be a mathematician to draw that graph. Women, in fact, are the most likely to be jeopardized by the new Texas law, which requires a government issued photo ID to have your name be ""substantially similar"" to how it appears on registration rolls. Unfortunately, divorces, taking a husband's surname, remarriages and retaining maiden names serve to create conflicts between old registrations and current IDs for women. And because younger women don't immediately update their government documentation after marriage, a survey by the Brennan Center for Justice indicates about 34% of them won't be qualified to vote because their names will not match state records. Because there's no way to measure what doesn't happen, we can't know how many women simply did not vote in the election this week because they didn't have the appropriate photo ID. The political impact of this plot is expected to be disproportionately significant with the gubernatorial candidacy of State Sen. Wendy Davis, which will likely increase turnout of female voters. Unsurprisingly, Davis, who is divorced, encountered the problem when she went to cast her ballot in the statewide constitutional election, the first to be held under the law. She was allowed to vote after signing an affidavit confirming she was, indeed, a senator and resident of the state. Davis' likely GOP opponent for governor is Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. His name didn't match registration records. His campaign manager said Abbott, too, would have to sign an affidavit. Abbott, a big supporter of the photo requirement, would not have been able to vote had it not been for Davis passing a last-minute amendment to the voter ID law that allowed the signing of sworn documents to enable voting when records did not match. Davis, essentially, saved the state's attorney general from disenfranchising himself. And if a law nearly victimizes people with resources and advanced educations, consider its implications for the poor. Up to a million registered voters in Texas could be without a valid ID to be eligible to participate in elections. How many did not show up at the polls November 5 because of worries about IDs? And Texas isn't exactly making it easy to acquire one, especially if you are a minority. First, identification has to be confirmed with a document such as a birth certificate, which costs $22 in Texas. The prospective voter can use that to get a driver's license -- but 81 counties out of the state's 254 don't even have a Department of Motor Vehicle office. Supreme Court testimonies showed that some people would have to drive 250 miles to reach a DMV facility and that in those counties, Hispanics were twice as likely as whites to be without a vehicle. It's not exactly simple for wage earners in urban areas, either. There are almost no DMV offices in the inner cities; they are mostly located in suburban areas and only open during work hours. An hourly employee would have to jump a bus out to a DMV location during lunch hour to get an ID. We can assume how often that might happen, which is rarely, especially in a state with almost no viable mass transit. That's why generous Texas lawmakers funded mobile facilities in 20 counties to help people obtain IDs in locations with limited access to state services. Unfortunately, the Department of Public Safety has only issued about 100, which hasn't made much of a dent in hundreds of thousands of registered voters still lacking legal ID to vote. And that's probably what the legislature and the governor of Texas wanted to happen. No, that is precisely the outcome they desired. Texas law continues, however, to respect certain population groups. In the state Capitol, if you have a concealed carry handgun permit, your gun and you can move right into the building through the security express lane and avoid inspection. That handy little gun card will also get you access to a voting booth, even when a war hero and former U.S. House speaker and potential future governors are temporarily denied.

"(CNN) -- Syrian government officials will attend the international conference dubbed ""Geneva II"" that is charged with bringing about an end to the violence that has wracked the country since March 2011, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Wednesday. Presidential adviser Bouthaina Shaaban told Russia Today TV on Tuesday that the government would attend without preconditions and with the goal of stopping violence and terrorism in the country, SANA reported. She ridiculed the opposition coalition as a front for Saudi intelligence. ""Who does the coalition represent?"" she asked rhetorically, and then cited two groups described as terrorist by the U.S. State Department. ""Is it al Qaeda or Jabhat al-Nusra?"" Shaaban described the Syrian government as a legitimate and elected representative of the Syrian people. In Beirut, Lebanese caretaker Foreign Minister Adnan Mansour said in a statement issued Tuesday that Geneva II is the only solution to the crisis and that Lebanon would participate, if invited, SANA reported. The long-delayed conference would not occur before December, Russian state news agency Itar-Tass reported Tuesday, citing a source close to talks among the United Nations, Russia and the United States. Representatives from the United Nations, Russia and the United States met Tuesday in Geneva in hopes of ironing out a plan for the talks, which have been held up in part because many branches of the Syrian opposition have said they wouldn't attend, or wouldn't participate without preconditions. Nineteen largely Islamist rebel groups, for example, last month flatly rejected participating. Some groups want Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down before talks. And the Syrian National Coalition, a rebel umbrella group, said it wouldn't participate if Iran -- an ally of the Syrian regime -- is invited. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said there will be no preconditions for the talks, Itar-Tass reported Tuesday, adding that preconditions would run counter to plans that the United States and Russia previously drew up for the conference. The United States and Russia announced in May that they would try to bring the warring parties to a second conference in Geneva to implement the peace plan they endorsed at Geneva I in 2012, which left open the question of whether al-Assad must leave power. Russia's semi-official Interfax News Agency reported Wednesday that Moscow has invited Syrian opposition leaders to Moscow for ""informal contacts"" ahead of Geneva II. ""Our proposal for informal contacts in Moscow as part of the process of organization of Geneva II would be important from the point of view of creating a favorable atmosphere, so that people can meet and discuss their issues,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov told reporters. Meanwhile, the killing continued. A bomb exploded Wednesday afternoon at the entrance to Syria's railway headquarters in the capital, killing at least eight people and wounding others, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. Women, children and laborers who were doing maintenance work at the office building at Hijaz Square in central Damascus, SANA said. A photo published by SANA showed exterior concrete steps in pieces; another photo showed two bags of vegetables abandoned on a nearby street. The explosion comes amid a civil war in the Middle Eastern nation. The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Presidential adviser Shaaban says the government will attend without preconditions .

"Kabul (CNN) -- On the outskirts of Kabul, behind a high wall is a building that used to serve as a school classroom. On the outside, painted on the dusty gray walls, are murals of brightly colored animals. Inside on the worn-out carpet sits a family, huddled together. Masoma smiles shyly as we enter the room. The 25-year-old mother of two invites me to sit on a deep red cushion, used at night for their bedding. Her children -- five-year-old Ali and eight-year-old Mohammad --- sit close to their grandmother, Zahra, who looks much older than her 54 years. Masoma's sister, 20-year-old Fatima, and older brother Husain, 27, lean against the wall looking on as we set up for the interview. They may look like any normal Afghan family, but they're hiding a shameful secret: They're all addicted to opium, the main ingredient of heroin. It is a drug so prevalent that one million Afghans are addicted to it -- that's 8% of the population, according to the United Nations. ""It's very bad,"" explains Masoma. ""At first when I started to use the drug, it was like a medicine for pain relief after my husband died. But when I became completely addicted and needed it every day, I knew I had to search for a way to stop all this."" Masoma's mother, sister and older brother also used the drug to dull their pain when Masoma's younger brother died soon after her husband. They too became addicted. ""It made us feel calm and gave us comfort,"" says Masoma. ""When I felt bad about my husband and younger brother, using opium decreased my sorrow."" After inhaling the additive smoke that often swirled around the house, Masoma's two young children soon became addicted, without her even realizing. Read more: Afghan infants fed pure opium . ""I feel shame,"" she tells me as her mother weeps in the background. ""I always say to myself, why did I do this? Why didn't I think about my children, my future? People want nothing to do with us."" That was until Laila Haidari found them. The local Afghan woman set up Mother Camp in the abandoned school about a year ago. It's a place for drug addicts to live, escape their destructive environment and hopefully get clean. She and her small team of volunteers offer counseling to help the addicts become ""mentally strong."" There is no government assistance to fund the program. Instead the profits from a restaurant she owns keep Mother Camp running. ""I was sick of seeing all these drug addicts. They used to congregate under the Pol-e-Sukhta bridge, near Kabul University,"" she recalls. ""The people where in such bad condition -- hundreds maybe more were there every single day. The police moved them on so now they're spread out all over the city. But nobody is there to think about their life and take care of them, so that's when I came up with idea to start Mother Camp."" Read more: U.N.: Afghanistan 'world's biggest producer of hashish' She admits that not everyone is cured by the time they leave the program. In fact many return to their former lives, but she says she has to try and help these people who've lost all hope. ""Nobody is helping people in my country,"" she says. ""Everything is so wrong here. The government is corrupt, which means society is also corrupt."" In another suburb, close to the slums of Kabul, is a methadone clinic operated by Medecins du Monde (Doctors of the World). It's the only clinic in Afghanistan that is allowed to dispense methadone --- a substitute for heroin. Some 71 addicts registered on the program arrive each day to receive the methadone -- a liquid poured into a small paper cup and drunk once a day. Program director Ernst Wisse says this is the best and most effective way to get drug addicts off heroin. It also eliminates the use of needles and dramatically reduces the risk of HIV spreading. ""What we fear is that this epidemic, we have a concentrated epidemic of HIV among the entire population... if this grows, and it will grow if you don't put any effective intervention into place, then automatically it will get out of hand and then there's nothing you can do,"" he says. Two years ago, the Afghan government allowed Medecins du Monde to expand the methadone program to 200 clients. Several months later they shut it down, Wisse says, claiming they hadn't decided if this was the best form of treatment. ""This decision means there are only 71 clients under methadone in the whole of Afghanistan,"" explains Wisse. ""The drug addiction problem in Afghanistan is enormous and growing and unless they extend the program, the situation is only going to get worse."" Watch video: Drug addiction rampant on Kabul's streets . In a small room at the back of a clinic is a bed for addicts who walk in off the street. The program has been able to take a new patient because one of the registered addicts came off methadone. Wisse introduces me to 38-year-old Asadullah who has just arrived. He gets off the bed and shakes my hand -- a huge smile reveals his missing teeth. What teeth he does have are black and decaying. Asadullah decided to come to the clinic after meeting the outreach team of Medecins du Monde. Several times a week, the health workers visit areas around Kabul where drug addicts live and hand out clean needles, sterile swabs and offer counseling. ""I know these people, they used to give me clean needles. They kept telling to come to the clinic and finally I did,"" he proudly explains. ""I feel better now, because the methadone is a replacement of the drug -- it gives us a better feeling. I want to use methadone until I forget about drugs completely and to find a good way to start a normal life again."" Asadullah has been using heroin for the past 14 years, supporting a habit of three grams a day, which costs about US$24. But the father of four says his family has had enough, and has told him he has to get off drugs or they won't support him any longer. ""Drugs are ruining my life. It's a bad thing in our society,"" he says. ""I also have got bad effects from drugs and my family has also been affected -- that's why I need to stop this."" One man who now works at the clinic knows exactly what Asadullah is going through. Raheem, 48, was one of the first patients to arrive at the clinic two and a half years ago. ""I'd been using drugs for 17 years. I started when I was in a prison in Iran,"" he says. ""During that time I faced a lot of problems and difficulties. I didn't have any information or contact with my family and that's when I started to use heroin. ""When I got out of prison someone told me methadone was coming to Afghanistan and I wanted to get on the program. Now I don't even use methadone."" Raheem's journey is inspiring but sadly it's the rare exception in Afghanistan, not the rule.","Family of seven addicted to opium seeking treatment in Kabul .

"(CNN) -- Apple is opening up about how many government requests it gets for customer information. The secretive company released its first transparency report on Tuesday, breaking down the number of account and device data requests it received from law enforcement by country for the first half of 2013. The United States submitted the most requests for account information, with 1,000 to 2,000 requests regarding 2,000 to 3,000 individual accounts. These requests might be for personal information found in iTunes, Game Center and iCloud accounts. The vast majority of requests the company receives are from law enforcement agencies trying to track down lost or stolen phones, tablets and computers on behalf of Apple customers. Apple received 3,542 of these ""device information"" requests in the U.S. for 8,605 devices, and Apple turned over some or all of the desired information 88 of the time. Germany made the second largest number of device requests, followed by Singapore. This is the first time Apple has released a transparency report. Google began disclosing data about its government requests in 2011 and releases an updated list every six months. Since the initial revelations about surveillance by the National Security Agency came to light earlier this year, there has been an uptick in the number of tech companies voluntarily releasing statistics on the government requests they get. Apple joins Facebook, Yahoo and other tech companies taking part in a practice that is fast becoming industry standard. ""Apple is so secretive about everything it does, the fact that it is opening up shows that transparency really is the new standard, and the consumers are demanding it,"" said Nate Cardozo, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Though the information in the reports is somewhat standard, Apple did included something different. The last line under the notes section in the report says, ""Apple has never received an order under Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act. We would expect to challenge such an order if served on us."" Section 215 is the part of the Patriot Act the NSA could use to compel companies to hand over user data. If Apple did receive such an order, it would likely be accompanied by a gag order so Apple would not even be able to say that it did or did not receive a 215 request. Cardozo says this type of disclosure is called a canary, and Apple is the first major tech company to include it. ""Six months from now, we will look to make sure that line is included, and if they don't say they have not received a 215 request, we can assume they have,"" said Cardozo. Apple also joined Yahoo and Google and filed a brief in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court asking for more transparency to discuss government requests openly and in more detail. Currently, the U.S. government only allows companies to talk about how many national security orders, including the numbers of accounts impacted, in ranges of thousands. ""We have reported all the information we are legally allowed to share, and Apple will continue to advocate for greater transparency about the requests we receive,"" Apple said in the report. The other information in Apple's report was fairly standard. It's difficult to compare Apple's numbers directly to those previously disclosed by companies such as Facebook and Google. Though they're all technology companies, they are vastly different businesses and store different amounts and types of data about their users. ""Our business does not depend on collecting personal data. We have no interest in amassing personal information about our customers,"" Apple said in the beginning of the report. That statement seems to be dig directed at companies such as Google, LinkedIn, Facebook and many others that do base their businesses on collecting their customers' personal information. The hunger for personal data isn't limited to governments as it's also very lucrative for many technology companies.","Apple released its first report listing the amount of government requests for information .

"(CNN) -- The cloud sounds amazing. Set up your entire digital life to sync automatically with a server run by some big (ostensibly responsible) tech company, and you never have to worry about losing data again, right? Wrong, of course. As a Wired writer's recent brush with hackers shows, there are plenty of ways for your cloud-based accounts -- Amazon, Apple, Google -- to be hacked. And while both Amazon and Apple responded to Mat Honan's story (you should read the whole thing; he says he lost all his pictures of his young daughter in the attack) by at least temporarily changing their policies in hopes of better protecting consumers, there are still plenty of cloud-related precautions security experts say you should take. These go beyond just setting passwords that aren't ""12345."" (Hopefully you made that switch in 1998. Hopefully.) Here are five of the best cloud-safety tips we could rustle up: . 1. Backup everything -- in the cloud and on the ground. In his account for Wired, Honan writes that he doesn't actually blame the person who hacked him for the fact that he lost all of the data on his laptop. ""I'm mostly mad at myself,"" he writes. ""I'm mad as hell for not backing up my data. I'm sad, and shocked, and feel that I am ultimately to blame for that loss."" Robert Siciliano, an online security expert at McAfee, said people should back up their data not only with a cloud service such as iCloud, Mozy or others but also on ""at least two, three or four"" real-life hard drives. For maximum protection, put these backups in multiple locations. ""You don't want to have all your eggs in one basket,"" he said. 2. Use a bunch (maybe hundreds?) of different passwords. Here's another one from Siciliano: Create different passwords for every single online account. ""I have 700 and something passwords,"" he said. You can use a password management service such as RoboForm or LastPass to generate hard-to-guess passwords and to store them on the devices you use most often. Other security experts recommend writing the passwords down in one place and storing that paper in your wallet -- although that could pose a security risk if your wallet is stolen. 3. Don't link all of your accounts together. This is sometimes called daisy-chaining, and Honan writes that it's one of the things that did him in. If you use Facebook, Twitter or Google to log in to other social networks or websites, you may run the risk of all those accounts being compromised at once. Siciliano said it's OK to link accounts sometimes, but you should try to think like a hacker when you're doing it. ""Connect accounts,"" he said, ""but you have to reverse engineer the process. What could a bad guy do if he got access to this account?"" If he or she could get bank account info, reconsider. 4. Use two-factor authentication on Google and Facebook. This one is key. Both Facebook and Google offer what's called ""two-factor authentication"" or sign-in. Google's Matt Cutts explained this in detail in a recent blog post called ""Please turn on two-factor authentication."" He writes: ""Two-factor authentication means 'something you know' (like a password) and 'something you have,' which can be an object like a phone."" For example, Google will send you a code via text or voice message when you sign in. You'll then need your password and the code to log into your Google account from an unfamiliar computer if you have two-factor authentication turned on. ""You can tell Google to trust your (other) computer for 30 days and sometimes even longer,"" Cutts writes. Facebook, meanwhile, has a similar feature that it calls ""Login Approvals."" It's used when you log in from an unfamiliar computer. You have to turn both these features on. And, according to Wired's Kim Zetter, some other services, including Amazon, Rackspace and WordPress (with a plug-in) have two-factor authentication, using some of Google's tools. Not every online service has these options. But ""when a site has given you additional security options (like Gmail's two factor authentication which sends you an SMS when you try to log into your account) -- USE THEM!"" Graham Cluley, a senior technology consultant at Sophos, wrote in an e-mail. 5. Don't use 'Find My Mac' on Apple computers. Here's another one from Honan. If you use ""Find My Mac,"" which is designed to help you locate your laptop in the event of a theft, you run the risk that a thief or hacker could wipe it clean, which is what appears to have happened to him. ""When you perform a remote hard drive wipe on Find my Mac, the system asks you to create a four-digit PIN so that the process can be reversed. But here's the thing: If someone else performs that wipe -- someone who gained access to your iCloud account through malicious means -- there's no way for you to enter that PIN,"" he writes.

"London (CNN) -- A British girl who survived the execution-style killing of her father, mother and grandmother in a normally idyllic region of the Alps last week returned to Britain on Friday, authorities said. Zainab al-Hilli, 7, left France in the morning and arrived in the UK, Surrey police said. As the only survivor, she could be a key witness who saw who carried out the shooting, according to the French prosecutor leading the investigation. She spent several days in a medically induced coma, and as of Wednesday, she remained too badly injured to be questioned, Eric Maillaud said. She was beaten and shot in the attack, and rescued by a British cyclist who came upon the scene on September 5. The cyclist, former Royal Air Force pilot Brett Martin, helped the injured girl and called for help. In an interview with BBC News, he recounted the shocking scene he stumbled across as he went on a regular bike ride in a national park. Martin said what he found in the parking lot -- three people shot dead in a car and a fourth on the ground nearby -- was like ""a Hollywood scene."" His account came as French prosecutor Maillaud and investigating Judge Michel Mollin were in Britain seeking new leads in the case. They met with Surrey Police, whose officers have been helping French investigators to search the home of two of the victims, Saad and Ikbal al-Hilli, in Claygate town, Surrey county. Bomb squad clears suspicious items in victims' home . Maillaud said it was ""highly likely that the reasons and causes for (the crime) have their origin in this country."" ""Our presence here does not mean that there are problems between the two jurisdictions,"" Maillaud said. ""We wish to reinforce our cooperation and understanding with hope to reach a conclusion to these horrible murders."" Surrey Police will do all they can to assist the French-led investigation, said Rob Price, the assistant chief constable. Maillaud said Wednesday that investigators were focused on three main areas: Saad al-Hilli's job, his links to his native Iraq and a reported family dispute over money involving his brother. Born in Baghdad in 1962, Saad al-Hilli was a naturalized British citizen who had lived in the United Kingdom for decades. He was an engineer working at Surrey Satellite Technology, a high-tech company owned by EADS, an aerospace corporation that builds satellites. Authorities have been tight-lipped about possible perpetrators and motives in the attack, although speculation has been rife in the British media. Martin's account to the BBC shed fresh light on the grisly scene that confronted French police near Lake Annecy after the alarm was raised last Wednesday. 'Slaughter at Chevaline': More questions than answers . The first thing he saw as he cycled up the mountain road near the village of Chevaline was the bike of a French cyclist on the ground, Martin said. Then he spotted the wounded girl, whose parents and grandmother were subsequently identified as those shot to death in the car. She was stumbling and falling over, and at first he thought she was playing, Martin told the BBC. Then he realized she was injured and put her in a recovery position as she slipped in and out of consciousness. The car engine was still revving and wheels spinning, he said, making him fear it could move and harm the girl and the cyclist whose bike he had seen on the ground. ""At first I thought, there's been a terrible accident between a cyclist and a car, because there was a cyclist on the ground more or less in front of the car. But there were things that didn't quite match, because the cyclist's bike wasn't beside him, so as the minutes went on, I started to change my opinion,"" he told the BBC. He pushed in one of the car windows, which had bullet holes in it, to turn off the engine -- and saw the bodies inside. ""I've never seen people who've been shot before for real ... but it seemed to me just like a Hollywood scene, and if someone had said 'cut' and everybody got up and walked away, that would have been it. But unfortunately, it was real life. ... It became quite obvious now, taking stock, that it was a gun crime,"" he said. Realizing that whoever was responsible could still be in the area, Martin became increasingly anxious but faced a dilemma. He had no cell phone signal to call emergency services, but the girl appeared too badly injured for him to carry her down the mountain. Martin decided to leave her in a safe position and set off back down the road on his bike to summon help. He managed to flag down a car and asked the French motorist to call for help, before returning to the scene to check on the girl, who was then unconscious. He added that he was not surprised that French police had failed to spot a second child, a 4-year-old girl, hiding in the back of the car under her dead mother's legs, for nearly eight hours. The girl, who has been reunited with other family members, told investigators she heard noise but saw nothing. Young girl found alive among bodies in France . Martin, from Sussex in southern England, went back to France on Wednesday to retrace his route and see if new recollections came to mind. The pilot, who now works in civil aviation and has a family business in Annecy, had given a detailed statement to police immediately after the shooting, including details of vehicles that passed him on the road, he said. CNN's Kirsten Dewar, Laura Smith-Spark and Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.","The 7-year-old girl is potentially the only person now alive who saw the killings, authorities say .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Clashes erupted between demonstrators and security forces in Egypt on Sunday, leaving 51 people dead and more than 260 injured, state media reported. The violence started early Sunday afternoon as Muslim Brotherhood protesters marched in different neighborhoods in Cairo and across the country. In Egypt's capital, people swam across the Nile River to escape arrest as military armored personnel carriers supported police clearing the streets of protesters. Tear gas filled the air and security forces with batons beat some of the protesters they detained. It was another powerful sign that Egypt's military-backed interim government will go to almost any measure to shut down the Muslim Brotherhood's protests. But in nearby Tahrir Square, the scene was drastically different; throngs of people celebrated Egypt Armed Forces Day at a festive event that included dancing and fireworks. As thousands of Muslim Brotherhood protesters marched along the Nile from Old Cairo toward Tahrir, security forces blocked their path and quickly dispersed the crowd. Health Ministry official Khaled El-Khatib told CNN that the death toll included 19 people killed in Cairo, 20 people killed in Giza, four people killed in Beni Suef and one person killed in Minya. Nationwide, 268 people were injured, state media reported. In a statement, the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party decried what it called ""crimes of violence and murder committed today against peaceful protesters,"" adding that it holds the leaders of the coup that ousted former President Mohamed Morsy responsible. Egypt's Interior Ministry said it had arrested 423 ""rioters"" on Sunday. In September, an Egyptian court banned all activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and froze its finances, drawing complaints from the international community. At the United Nations General Assembly, Egypt's interim foreign minister sought to quell these concerns. Nabil Fahmy said Egypt will hold elections in the spring. He also argued that the political process is open to all ""as long as they are committed to the renunciation of violence and terrorism and acts of incitement to them."" On Sunday, protesters from the Muslim Brotherhood said they would accept nothing less than the reinstatement of the government led by Morsy. But supporters of the military in Tahrir Square remained adamant that that shouldn't happen. Neither side appeared willing to compromise. Violent clashes after relative calm .

"(CNN) -- Explosions and gunfire claimed at least 31 more lives between Tuesday night and early Wednesday in the latest spasms of violence in Iraq. In one incident in al-Tarmiya, about 70 kilometers (43.5 miles) north of Baghdad, two suicide bombers attacked the house of a Sunni leader during a Tuesday night banquet to honor Iraqi security forces, killing 22 people and wounding 15 others, police in Tikrit said. In another incident on Wednesday, attackers targeting security forces staged a coordinated assault on a police checkpoint west of Mosul, Iraq, killing at least nine people and wounding 25 others. According to Mosul police, a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb at a checkpoint manned by police and military forces about in al-Mowali, a predominantly Shiite district 55 kilometers (34 miles) west of Mosul. Gunmen then opened fire on an ambulance carrying security forces wounded in the blast. Among the dead were four security officers and four women, police said. Violence has been on the upswing in Iraq since spring as tensions have grown between the country's Shiite majority and its Sunni minority. More than 6,000 people have been killed this year, including more than 350 this month.","NEW: Attack north of Baghdad leaves 22 dead during banquet to honor security forces .

"(CNN) -- At a modest stucco home in Montgomery, Alabama, an unlikely presidential victory celebration is taking place this morning. Barack Obama's election victory represents a triumph for civil rights activists before him. Peggy Wallace Kennedy, the daughter of the late George Wallace, the Alabama governor who once vowed to maintain segregation forever, is rejoicing. Kennedy, 58, voted for Sen. Barack Obama. She says she was ""mesmerized"" when she first heard him speak at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Her admiration for Obama deepened when she learned he opposed the Iraq war. She even slapped an Obama bumper sticker on her car, even though someone told her that the prospect of an African-American president would have her father ""rolling over in his grave."" ""I think Obama is going to be one of the best presidents we'll have,"" she says. ""He's going to bring the freshness we need. We've just been bogged down so long. We need this shot in the arm.""  Watch Obama address supporters after his win » . President-elect Obama's victory Tuesday may be a racially transformative event. But for people like Kennedy, who came through the fires of the civil rights movement, it also represents something else -- personal triumph. Obama's win validates the risks they took years ago. iReport.com: What does Obama's victory mean to you? Some, like Kennedy and an entire generation of white Southerners, risked social rejection for renouncing the bigotry of their parents. Others risked their lives while leading civil rights campaigns in the Deep South. Some almost lost their belief in the inherent goodness of America because they saw so many innocent people die. iReport.com: 'This is the most wonderful night of my life' They are people like Bob Moses, who led African-American voter registration drives in Mississippi during the early 1960s. He was a leader in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Mississippi when three civil rights workers were murdered by a group of men that included a Mississippi deputy sheriff. He also helped lead an ill-fated attempt to sit African-American delegates from Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, which was segregated. Moses grew so disenchanted by his experiences that he moved to Tanzania. He returned to the United States in 1976 and founded the Algebra Project, a national program that encourages African-American students to attend college by first teaching them mathematical literacy. ""We seem to be evolving..., "" Moses says. ""The country is trying to reach for the best part of itself."" Moses is evolving as well. Obama is the first president he's voted for in three decades, he says. ""I don't do politics, but I made sure to vote this time,"" says Moses, now 73 years old. ""Obama is the first person I really felt moved to vote for."" Moses says he is amazed that Obama has helped lead the country through a racially transformative moment without anyone getting killed. Pivotal events in America's racial history -- the debate over slavery, the assault on segregation -- sparked widespread violence, Moses says. ""I don't think people appreciate how delicate it is to move the society around these questions without descent into chaos or into pockets of chaos,"" he says. Obama's victory also offered a rare public acknowledgement for Moses. He recently attended an Obama rally when Obama -- a keen student of the civil rights movement -- discovered he was in the audience. ""When he got on the platform, he gave me a shout out,"" says Moses, whose reluctance to be in the spotlight was notorious among his civil rights colleagues. ""He said, 'there's someone in the audience, and he's a hero of mine.' "" Moses paused when asked how it felt. ""It was good."" The nation goes full circle . Obama's victory, though, wasn't just made possible by civil rights activists, some say. It was also made possible by a generation of African-American leaders who excelled in the political, sports and entertainment arenas: former Secretary of State Colin Powell, golfer Tiger Woods and pop culture figures like actor Bill Cosby and Dennis Haysbert, who portrays a black president in the television series ""24.""  Watch Powell discuss his reaction to Obama's win » . They didn't change laws, but they did shift perceptions, some say. ""We live in a society where white voters are prepared and accustomed to seeing African-Americans in prominent positions and leadership,"" says Brett Gadsden, an assistant professor of African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. The Rev. James Zwerg almost lost his life trying to usher in this new society. Zwerg, who is white, participated in the Freedom Rides in the early 1960s, and he says Obama's victory means the country has gone ""full-circle."" Zwerg was almost beaten to death by a white mob in 1961 when he dared to sit next to African-Americans on a Greyhound bus. He was part of a group of white and black college students, dubbed ""Freedom Riders,"" who tried to desegregate interstate travel. The photos of a bloodied Zwerg, standing next to a battered John Lewis -- who would go on to become a Georgia congressman --rallied activists across the nation. Zwerg became a civil rights hero, but his father disowned him for protesting alongside African-Americans.  Watch Lewis celebrate Obama's victory » . Yet Zwerg became so tormented by the attention he received -- he thought he got too much credit because he was white -- that he once contemplated suicide. Zwerg, 68, says the bond he experienced with other Freedom Riders caused the most inspiring moments of his life. Obama's campaign reminded him of that era. ""Obama's message reflects much of the same idealism that [the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.] spoke of when he talked about coming together to improve our country,"" Zwerg says. ""He's really rekindled the same enthusiasm for change among young people, which is terrific."" Zwerg says he never thought back then that an African-American would integrate the Oval Office -- nor did any Freedom Rider. ""I don't think it really crossed our mind."" Clayborne Carson, a former activist and now a Stanford University historian, remembers getting arrested in 1965 just because he demanded the right to vote. He says it was ""inconceivable"" then that the United States would elect an African-American president. ""I remember how it was still a controversial act for President [Lyndon] Johnson to even select a black person for his Cabinet,"" Carson says. Carson says many people forget that many African-Americans in the South were not allowed to vote until the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, a law passed only after the bloody civil rights campaign in Selma, Alabama, mobilized public opinion. ""America was a democracy in name only,"" Carson says. ""It's only since the mid-1960s that we've had this experiment in a multicultural and multiracial democracy."" Carson says he sees the future of this multicultural experiment not only in Obama's victory, but also in his Stanford classroom. More than half of his students are not native white Americans but Asians, Latinos and African-Americans, he says. He also sees a troubling future for the United States in his travels to counties like India and China. Those countries have highly educated youths who ""have the sense that the future belongs to them."" ""I don't know if we have that confidence,"" he says. ""This symbolic change in leadership won't mean anything unless a President Obama can mobilize the country for the long, hard struggle to keep up with the world."" Kennedy, George Wallace's daughter, is thinking more about the past these days. She wonders how her father would have regarded Obama's victory. She says Wallace had his own racially transformative moment. He renounced bigotry later in his life, publicly apologized for the pain he caused and was elected to his last term as governor of Alabama with strong African-American support. Still, she doesn't know what he would say about her vote for Obama. ""I think he would be all right with it,"" she says. ""Daddy had come full circle. I really think that he would be happy about it or at least interested in it. I'm not sure he would have voted for Obama."" Obama's victory, however, doesn't mean the politics of exclusion that her father once practiced is history, she says. ""There's racism, and there always will be racism,"" she says. ""But this country has come a long way."" When asked how she was going to celebrate Obama's win, Kennedy gave a mischievous chuckle. She says she's going to continue to do what she and her husband, H. Mark Kennedy, a retired Alabama Supreme Court justice, have been doing the last few days since an Obama victory seemed certain: . ""We've been sitting here and watching Fox News go utterly berserk.""","Obama's win validates risks civil rights activists took years ago, some say .

"(CNN) -- Two Americans and a German shared the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine this year. Americans James E. Rothman and Randy W. Schekman, and German Thomas C. Sudhof were awarded the prize Monday for discoveries of how the body's cells decide when and where to deliver the molecules they produce. The Nobel Assembly said the three ""have solved the mystery of how the cell organizes its transport system."" Their work focuses on tiny bubbles inside cells called vesicles, which move hormones and other molecules within cells and sometimes outside them, such as when insulin is released into the bloodstream. Disruptions of this delivery system contribute to diabetes, neurological diseases and immunological disorders. Rothman, a professor at Yale University, detailed how protein machinery allows vesicles in cells to fuse with their targets to permit the transfer of molecular cargo. Schekman, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, was honored for discovering a set of genes required for the ""vesicle traffic."" Sudhof, a professor at Stanford University, showed how vesicles are instructed precisely when to release molecules. Schekman and Sudhof also are investigators at Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Monday's ceremony at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, will be followed by the announcement of the physics prize Tuesday, the chemistry prize Wednesday and the economics prize on October 14. The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded in Oslo, Norway, on Friday. The prize for literature will be awarded on a date to be announced later. Each prize comes with 8 million Swedish kronor ($1.2 million). Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel created the prizes in 1895 to honor work in physics, chemistry, literature and peace. The first economics prize was awarded in 1969. In 2012, the medical Nobel Prize was awarded to Sir John B. Gurdon of England and Shinya Yamanaka of Japan for work on reprogramming cells.

"(CNN) -- He has been ridden by pop star Kylie Minogue, actor Hugh Jackman has performed cabaret on him in a casino and he had his life saved by the last Australian Prime Minister. Meet Australian equine superstar Subzero. 'Subbie', as he is affectionately known, initially entered the Australian psyche when he was first past the post in the Melbourne Cup, the race that stops a nation 21 years ago, his last ever outing. As only the fifth grey horse to win one of horse racing's most prestigious races and the first since World War II, he was instantly a hit. But his celebrity status has very much come in retirement, much of it down to his myriad of public appearances from TV shows to schools and charity events. In all he has raised an estimated $10.4 million for charity during the past two decades. With the exception of Black Caviar, mention some of the most famous Australian horses to their countrymen, names such as Carbine, Tulloch or Phar Lap, and non-racegoers will stare at you blankly. Mention Subzero, and the recognition is immediate. For those 21 years of retirement, he has been owned by Melbourne Cup clerk of the course Graham Salisbury, and once more the prestigious grey will be paraded at Flemington Racecourse in front of his adoring public when the 2013 version of the classic race takes place on Tuesday. ""People love him because he's a grey and that's obviously a rarity, then there's the Melbourne Cup win but then there's the fact he's such a character, he's so likeable,"" Salisbury told CNN. ""Basically, he's everyone's mate; he's the people's horse. He's an absolute hero in Australia."" That wasn't always the case. Ironically for such a tame beast, he used to be an edgy horse but Salisbury spent a year with him gaining his trust, and making him comfortable with the public. That teaching involved 'Subbie' being blindfolded and Salisbury, laden with a bucket of carrots, calling for him to come to him. That trust was quickly built up and his owner admits he will follow him anywhere, however bizarre. And there have been some bizarre locations, from a lift at the prestigious Crown Casino to an airplane. He is so relaxed around the Salisburys, he even takes part in family meals... on occasion. ""He's got his own three-acre paddock and when we have a barbeque, he comes up, likes to have a chat, nod his head, have some lettuce and carrots, and maybe have a stubbie [an Australian term for a beer]. ""He's a right character. You ask him a question and he'll answer you with a nod of the head. If there's a seat, he'll even sit down and have a chat with you."" Part of the family . You would imagine that Salisbury would have to have parted with some serious money to take ownership of Subzero but, in truth, all it cost for him to take him for good was a solitary Australian dollar. Salisbury had been promised the horse for that cut price amount prior to the Melbourne Cup victory but, following that win, did he ever worry that the deal wouldn't go ahead? ""I remember when he won thinking 'Jesus, I'm not going to get him now',"" reveals Salisbury. ""But I was told I had a better chance than ever as the handicap would be too much for him. I guess I always knew it would be OK as Lee Freedman [his trainer] had made a promise of the price and he's always true to his word."" There are those that have tried to buy him since, notably two Arab sheiks, who both made separate offers to purchase Subzero on the spot while on a trip to the United Arab Emirates to coincide with the Dubai World Cup horse race. Salisbury reminisces: ""This guy came up to me and said 'right here, right now, I'll swap him for a brand new Mercedes'. I said 'no' and the guy said 'not a small Mercedes, one of the big ones' but I explained 'he's not for sale.' ""Then this other guy tried to buy him for $100,000. I explained I wouldn't sell him for any money. He's too good a mate, and anyway it'd be like selling my daughter."" Salisbury's daughter, at 19, is a newer addition to the family than Subzero, and as a result ""he's very much part of the family"". There have been times when there have been fears of losing this revered family member. 'Subbie' has had some occasional bouts of bad health, including a recent one. The prospect of the horse's possible death, forces Salisbury to tears. ""Sorry, I get pretty emotional thinking about that,"" he says, his voice cracking. ""I just hope I go before him."" Subzero's most serious problems came in 2009 when chronic arthritis took hold on his aging bones. Salisbury managed to rectify the problem with an American medication called SuperFlex and the introduction of it to Subzero's diet immediately rectified the problem. But a problem occurred when the next batch of medicine was refused entry into Australia because of insufficient paperwork. Salisbury persevered but failed to get that overturned, his condition deteriorated and there was talk of him being put down. It led to such a public outcry and the intervention of then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. ""I knew the then attorney general Rob Hulls and so mentioned it to him,"" says Salisbury. ""Then the permit I needed appeared suddenly. I rang to thank him but he explained the Prime Minister was the one that kicked up a fuss and got it sorted."" It has allowed Subzero to return to what, seemingly, he loves best -- namely entertaining his adoring fans, of which there is a long and varied list. ""I had some lads come up to me and 'Subbie' the other day,"" says Salisbury. They said they remember him coming to their school when he was kids. And then there's the sick kids in hospital whose faces light up when they see him. He's affected a lot of people's lives."" Some of Australia's brightest stars have even grown enamored after coming face to face with the equine superstar. ""I remember doing a charity thing at the casino with Jackman,"" says Salisbury looking back. ""I remember he said to me 'am I going to be OK on him?' I was like 'he'll be a lot better than those horses you rode in that film Australia.' ""Jackman's a big, big star but even he had to admit that he people were taking more photos of 'Subbie' than they were of his cabaret. ""It was the same with Kylie. She was with him at the Adelaide Cup some years back. OK, she wasn't the global star she is now then but she was still a massive star in Australia. She said 'I'm not used to being upstaged by a horse.'"" His brush with celebrity, in fact, has only endured one rare blip, when he ate the $600 hat of the socialite Lillian Frank. ""I've not had one problem, from having a family of four on his back, to getting on a plane or being patted by kids in a hospital, he's done it all without a fuss,"" adds Salisbury. His feats have been enough to warrant his own race meeting, held in Melbourne in October, and all manner of adulation, which with his health restored looks likely to continue for many more years.","Australia's equine star Subzero still celebrated 21 years after Melbourne Cup win .

"(CNN) -- A mile down in an abandoned gold mine in South Dakota, physicists in a state-of-the-art scientific laboratory are searching for elusive ""dark matter"" particles, which make up most of the mass in our universe. So far, no one has ever seen dark matter directly. You can't see it, touch it, smell it, throw a net over it, or tag it in the ways particle physicists deal with ordinary particles. We only know it by its gravitational effects on galaxies. On Wednesday, team members from LUX -- for Large Underground Xenon experiment -- announced the first results from their operation in the Sanford Underground Research Facility, deep in the former Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota -- where for three months they have been taking an 11-minute, 4,850 foot elevator ride down a mine shaft to work in their lab. Previous dark matter experiments suggested we were very close to the first direct detection. They predicted that with just slightly more sensitive detectors, like those in the LUX experiment, scientists would have definite evidence. Now LUX has shown those predictions were wrong. Were they correct, more than 1,600 particles should have been seen in the LUX data -- about one particle an hour. No such signals were seen. What the experiment succeeded in doing was ruling out earlier weak detections, showing they were not the real deal. Weak detections can be real or just a random fluctuation. Taking a photograph of something faint and far away might, in the shortest exposure, suggest a hint of something -- maybe the shape of an alien spaceship or the Loch Ness monster. But in better exposures that collect more light or have sharper resolution, those hints should turn into obvious images -- unless it was just a fluctuation, that is, in which case it would not become clearer no matter how long the exposure. If you can't see it, how did scientists find evidence of dark matter? One clear sign appeared in astronomical images taken in the 1980s, with photographic plates and new more sensitive detectors, that showed a really odd phenomenon: strange, long arcs of faint blue light behind groups of redder, rounder galaxies. At first, the arcs were dismissed as anomalies. They were like the Bigfoot of the sky: too odd to explain based on current knowledge, but not clear enough to claim a new species. As detectors improved even more and telescopes got bigger, more arcs were seen, typically behind clusters of galaxies. That meant an arc had to be the stretched image of a background galaxy -- stretched by the gravity of the foreground cluster. Albert Einstein predicted this phenomenon, called ""gravitational lensing."" According to his theory, gravity bends light much as the lenses in my glasses bend incoming light rays. An image of a very distant galaxy would be undistorted and true if no other galaxies were along the path between it and the Earth. But when light passes near or through a large mass -- like a cluster of galaxies, which can weigh as much as 1,000 times our Milky Way galaxy -- it bends because of the gravitational force of the cluster. The more massive the cluster, the more the light path curves. The more the light path bends, the more distorted the image of the distant background galaxy. So, a distant galaxy that just happens to line up behind a nearby, massive cluster of galaxies looks strangely elongated. And most important, the distortion of the image tells astronomers how much the nearby cluster weighs. But the arcs implied far too much mass for the number of stars we could see. Other mass estimates, based on the motions of galaxies in a cluster and of stars in the outskirts of a galaxy, also suggested the presence of a lot of unseen mass. This had to be some kind of matter that, unlike ordinary protons and electrons, didn't emit light. In fact, this dark matter, as it was called, didn't appear to follow any of the laws of physics, except gravity. By now a mountain of data points to the existence of dark matter. We even have data that cannot be explained away by alternate theories of gravity. So, what is dark matter? One candidate is a class of particles named WIMPs, an acronym standing for ""weakly interacting massive particles."" Some types of WIMPs have been ruled out by the LUX data. LUX and similar experiments try to detect the recoil of the nucleus of an atom -- for example, the nucleus of the noble gas xenon -- when it is hit spot-on by a dark matter particle. The dark matter escapes but the atom emits a flash of light that can be detected. The chances of this happening are exceedingly small -- about 1 in 10 trillion. It's like trying to see someone's nose twitch in a stadium full of crazy football fans. Putting a dark matter experiment deep underground quiets the noise by screening out lots of particles other than dark matter. That's what brought the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy to the Homestake gold mine, more than 130 years after gold-feverish dreamers flooded into South Dakota. After the Homestake Mine closed in 2003, several underground rooms were retrofitted as a dedicated science facility. More than 100 hardworking physicists and engineers on the LUX team made this new measurement experiment possible, including many students and postdoctoral scholars searching for their version of gold. Whatever these young scientists end up doing in the future -- and with the skills they learn, they could do just about anything -- they made an important step toward direct detection of dark matter particles. Imagine having that on your resume: I searched for dark matter in an abandoned gold mine. ""This is only the beginning for LUX,"" says one of the experiment leaders, Dan McKinsey, my colleague at Yale. ""Now that we understand the instrument and its backgrounds, we will continue to take data, testing for more and more elusive candidates for dark matter."" As LUX and others continue to take data, we wait for a future announcement of, we hope, the first direct detection of dark matter. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","Meg Urry: A mile down in an old gold mine, physicists search for ""dark matter"" particles .

"London, England (CNN) -- The former husband of alleged Russian spy Anna Chapman said her personality changed after she started having ""secretive meetings"" with Russian friends a few years ago. Alex Chapman told The Daily Telegraph newspaper he ""hardly knew her anymore"" after she became involved with shadowy contacts. Anna Chapman also confided to her husband that her father, Vasily, had been a senior KGB agent. The Chapmans met at a London rave or party in 2001, when Alex Chapman, then 21, saw her across the dance floor and told her she was ""the most beautiful girl"" he had ever seen. She was 19. They married six months later. Her ""carefree"" bohemian lifestyle soon changed, however, he told the paper, and she became obsessed with money and moving to America. ""It was like someone having a midlife crisis, but in their 20s,"" Chapman told the paper. ""She would arrange to go out, but when I said I would join her, she told me not to bother because they would all be speaking Russian. She was adamant I wasn't to meet them."" Chapman said he had suspicions she was being ""conditioned"" by shadowy contacts by the time their marriage broke down in 2005. ""She had never been materialistic during the years we were together, but in 2005 and 2006, after she started having these meetings with people she referred to as 'Russian friends,' she was transformed into someone with access to a lot of money, boasting about all the influential people she was meeting."" There was such a ""dramatic change"" in her thoughts and behavior that ""I felt I hardly knew her anymore,"" he said. Chapman is one of 10 suspects arrested this week in the States as part of an alleged Russian spy ring. She was denied bail and has her next hearing July 27. The suspects were ""trained Russian intelligence operatives,"" a U.S. Justice Department spokesman said, and information from court documents alleged they were part of a mission to plant ""deep-cover"" agents in the United States. The Justice Department said the suspects were supposed to recruit intelligence agents, but were not directly involved in obtaining U.S. secrets themselves. They were charged with acting as agents of a foreign government, and nine also were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The case resulted from a ""multiyear investigation"" conducted by the FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Justice Department's National Security Division, according to a Justice Department statement. Chapman and another suspect, Mikhail Semenko, allegedly conducted the private wireless computer links to communicate with a Russian government official, one court document alleged. In one instance, Chapman was in a bookshop and the Russian government official drove by in a van to make the wireless connection, the document said. Wednesday, a Security Service officer visited Alex Chapman at his current home in Bournemouth, England, to question him about his ex-wife, the Telegraph reported. The officer wanted to know whether Anna Chapman could have been recruited in London or even spied on Britain while she lived there, the paper said. Alex Chapman met his former father-in-law for the first time during the couple's delayed honeymoon to Africa in 2002, he said. ""Her dad was scary,"" he said. ""He was very concerned about which direction my life was going, how I was going to earn my money. Anna told me he worked as a diplomat for the Russian government. It was only much later that she told me he had been a KGB agent."" The Chapmans remained close after their divorce in 2006, the Telegraph reported, and Alex Chapman ""watched with bemusement"" as his former spouse achieved success in America. ""She had always said she didn't like America,"" Chapman told the paper. ""She didn't like their accents and would always imitate them when American TV shows were on. ""In late 2006 she went back to Russia and said she was staying there for good, but then all of a sudden she wanted to go to America. She started seeing a very rich American guy who took her to the States, and when she came back, she said she loved it."" Anna Chapman told her ex-husband she was having trouble making her Internet real estate agency a success, he said, but the business suddenly flourished last year and she was employing 50 people. ""Clearly a lot of money had been pumped into the business from somewhere, but I couldn't work it out,"" he said. Anna Chapman ""seemed distant"" when he last spoke to her four weeks ago, Alex Chapman told the paper. ""I thought I knew her, but she has taken this path I don't believe she consciously knew she was going down,"" he said. ""I believe in my heart there has been some sort of influence on her, some sort of conditioning. Then, when push came to shove, she found herself in a situation she couldn't get out of.""","Alex Chapman tells newspaper he ""hardly knew her anymore""

"(CNN) -- Ever heard of a Balinese Tiger? How about a Javan Tiger? No? That's not surprising. These two tiger sub-species went extinct decades ago thanks to massive habitat loss and poaching. The question is whether their cousins the Sumatran tigers, will soon join them. The odds are not in their favor. As recently as 1978 more than 1,000 Sumatran tigers lived on Sumatra. But thanks to appallingly high deforestation and rampant poaching their numbers have dropped to around 400. The once-lush green island has lost more than half its forest cover since 1985. According to TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring arm of WWF and IUCN, poachers kill at least 40 Sumatran tigers per year, and the killing is made that much easier as their habitat shrinks. This also brings them into conflict with people, which often results in retaliatory killings when they attack livestock or villagers. It's not hard to poach a tiger. A length of metal cable, a few strong branches and a little expertise in setting a snare can bag one pretty quickly. As Philippe Cousteau demonstrates in the groundbreaking CNN series Expedition: Sumatra, these snares are simple but stunningly effective tiger killers. And there just aren't enough anti-poaching patrols to find all of the snares and the people who set them. Read more: The battle to save Sumatra's elephants . So is there hope for the tigers of Sumatra? In short, yes. Using camera traps, scat surveys and other scientific tools WWF and its partners are able to estimate the population size and distribution of tigers across Sumatra. The camera traps are an especially valuable tool, allowing researchers to gather more precise data on individual tigers using their stripe patterns. Just like humans and fingerprints, no two tiger stripe patterns are the same. Understanding tiger distribution allows scientists and forestry officials to designate protected areas and wildlife corridors that allow tigers to breed and disperse, and also to understand where best to patrol against poaching. WWF's Tiger Protection Units patrol vulnerable areas, gather vital intelligence about poachers and remove poachers' snares. In places where they operate, poaching has dramatically declined. Tiger Protection Units also work with communities to help them better understand tigers and develop solutions to human-tiger conflict. The longer-term solution is more complicated but just as critical. It all comes down to zoning and land use planning that benefits critical wildlife habitat and the needs of indigenous groups such as the Orang Rimba and Talang Mamak. It's tough to make the case for protecting tiger forests when faced with stiff competition from the highly profitable pulp, paper and palm oil industries. But one innovative solution may help make the case. Read more: The devastation of Indonesia's forests . In Indonesia, most forest areas are owned by the government and leased out for commercial activities in long-term concessions. By rezoning critical tiger habitat currently slated for deforestation, mining or agriculture into ecosystem restoration concessions, the Indonesian government can protect wildlife, support local communities and ensure that the forests are managed sustainably. One such joint venture is currently under consideration in the buffer zone outside Sumatra's Bukit Tigapuluh National Park, also known as 30 Hills. As documented on Expedition: Sumatra, this is an ambitious and forward thinking venture that could be the best last hope for the tigers of 30 Hills. To find out how you can help, go to Change.org and add your name to a petition urging Indonesia to re-zone the areas around 30 Hills for conservation concessions. If given enough habitat, plenty of prey and protection from poaching, tigers are breeding machines. Their populations can rebound from even the low numbers currently seen in Sumatran tigers. The weak link in all of this is humans. We can be their worst enemy or their best friend. By rallying the political will to protect their habitat and stopping the relentless onslaught of poaching, we can be part of the solution and ensure that future generations will share a planet with these noble creatures.","In 1978 more than 1,000 Sumatran tigers lived on Sumatra .

"(CNN) -- British newspaper publishers have failed in their bid to block a new government-backed royal charter on press regulation, clearing the way for a new system of regulation proposed by UK lawmakers but opposed by news publishing companies. The royal charter is lawmakers' attempt to implement the recommendations of the 2012 Leveson Inquiry into press ethics, which was set up after outrage over claims of widespread phone hacking and other abuses by elements of the UK press. Supporters of the charter say it provides the legal framework and sufficient penalties to ensure effective self-regulation by a press which, they believe, has failed to do so in the past. Detractors say the government should never have a role, however remote, in regulating the press, and that the proposed charter is an attack on journalism and on press freedom. At Hacked Off, a campaign group which fought for the changes and was set up in the wake of the phone hacking scandal, a spokesman said: ""News publishers now have a great opportunity to join a scheme that will not only give the public better protection from press abuses, but will also uphold freedom of expression, protect investigative journalism and benefit papers financially... ""The time has come for the newspaper companies to listen to all of those voices, including the vast majority of their readers, and to distance themselves from a past marred by bullying, fabrication and intrusion."" But Roy Greenslade, a former editor who is now a media commentator, said in his Guardian column: ""It means, now that the Queen has approved it, that we face the existence of a royal charter to set up a system of press regulation that no publisher will sign up for. They will simply ignore its existence."" ""Instead, the publishers will create their own system, having already advanced concrete plans for a new regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso)."" In the UK Press Gazette, Tim Crook, a member of the Chartered Institute of Journalists, went further. He said the government's royal charter ""prescribes an unwanted, untried, untested, under-researched system of arbitration for media law disputes mostly paid for by the media whether they win or lose, taking place in secret, and leaving those who opt out with the future burden of punitive legal costs for open justice high court litigation."" At the UK Government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport, a spokesperson said: ""A Royal Charter will protect freedom of the press whilst offering real redress when mistakes are made. Importantly, it is the best way of resisting full statutory regulation that others have tried to impose. We will continue to work with the Industry, as we always have, and recent changes secured by the Culture Secretary, to arbitration, the standards code and the parliamentary lock will ensure the system is workable."" But Tony Gallagher, editor of the Daily Telegraph, tweeted: ""Well done everyone involved in the Royal Charter. Chances of us signing up for state interference: zero."" And Tim Luckhurst, a CNN contributor and University of Kent journalism professor tweeted: ""The Royal Charter is bad for journalism, bad for freedom of speech, and - vitally -appalling for the British public."" He added: ""Today Britain squandered a precious freedom.I fear that those who welcome press regulation now will regret it profoundly but too late.""","Court in Britain denies newspapers' attempt to block royal charter regulating press .

"(CNN) -- The captain of a Greenpeace icebreaker carrying 30 activists protesting Arctic drilling has declined a demand made at gunpoint by Russian authorities to sail it toward the Russian port city of Murmansk, a Greenpeace spokeswoman said Friday. ""Captain Pete has refused to sail the ship, so they're towing it,"" Molly Dorozenski told CNN in a reference to Pete Willcox, captain of the Arctic Sunrise. Late Thursday, about 15 members of the Russian coast guard seized the ship and those aboard by sliding down a rope hanging from a hovering helicopter. The guards, armed with handguns and rifles, took the activists to the ship's canteen and broke down the door to the communications room, smashing the equipment, said Ben Stewart, head of media for the group. The captives were told they were going to be taken to Murmansk, in northwest Russia, he said. The group documented the incident in tweets: . ""Russian authorities onboard with guns,"" said one. ""They are breaking into the comms room now."" Another one said this: ""Latest from the deck: Crew are sitting on their knees on the helipad with guns pointed at them."" And yet another: ""This is pretty terrifying. Loud banging. Screaming in Russian. They're still trying to kick in the door."" More than 12 hours later, Greenpeace International reported that its communication with those aboard the ship had been cut off. But it also reported that some activists were able to conduct interviews by satellite phone from the ship's mess, where they were being held. ""Greenpeace International has not received any formal confirmation of possible charges, and the activists have been denied access to legal or consular assistance,"" it said in a statement. ""Over 20 Greenpeace offices are organizing protests at Russian embassies around the world today."" ""They have done nothing to warrant this level of aggression and have been entirely peaceful throughout,"" said Ben Ayliffe, the head of Greenpeace International's Arctic oil campaign. ""The real threat to the Russian Arctic comes not from the crew of the Arctic Sunrise but from Gazprom, one of the most reckless oil companies in the world today,"" he said. Willcox, who grew up in South Norwalk, Connecticut, is the son of a yachtsman and has been a skipper for Greenpeace since 1981, according to a posting on the Greenpeace website. He was at the helm of the group's Rainbow Warrior in 1985, when it was bombed, Dorozenski said. ""So, he's been around the block a few times."" A media officer with the border patrol in Murmansk said that none of the activists was under arrest and that the ship was being escorted to Murmansk, where crew members will be questioned about the possibility that they broke the law related to exclusive economic zones. The Dutch have demanded that those aboard, including two Dutch nationals, be released immediately, said Friso Wijnen, a spokesman for consular affairs with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Dutch officials were in contact with Russian Embassy staff in Holland, and their own embassy staffers in Moscow were in contact with Russian officials, he said. The other detainees are from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, the United States, Britain, New Zealand, Ukraine, Russia, France, Italy, Turkey, Finland, Switzerland, Poland and Sweden, the group said. The ship was sailing under the Dutch flag, RIA Novosti said. The state-run Russian news agency said that Moscow had announced it gave a note to the Dutch ambassador expressing concern about a protest Wednesday in which the activists scaled an oil rig operated by a Gazprom subsidiary to call attention to its drilling plans. ""Gazprom is using out of date kit to drill in one of the most extreme environments on the planet,"" the group said in a tweet on September 17. ""We can't let that happen."" Russian border guards fired warning shots at the environmentalists' ship and detained two activists -- Finnish and Swiss nationals -- but returned them during Thursday's standoff, RIA Novosti said. No official comment from the guards was available, it added. ""The violators' actions were of an aggressive and provocative nature and had the appearance of extremist activity capable of causing human deaths and other grave consequences,"" Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its website, according to RIA Novosti. CNN's Ross Levitt, Saskya Vandoorne and Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report.","NEW: Captain Pete won't sail, so Russians tow the Arctic Sunrise .

"New York (CNN) -- The newspaper that published an online, interactive map of handgun permit holders in two suburban New York counties hired armed guards to protect its office after negative backlash from the map publication, according to a local police report. The January 1 report from the Clarkstown police department in Rockland County confirms the presence of armed private security guards at the Journal News. The incident report stemmed from e-mail responses to the newspaper's online map. The police statement says Caryn McBride, the paper's Rockland editor, reported ""that she received an e-mail from an unknown subject who wrote that he wondered what (she) would get in her mail now."" ""The e-mail was brief and did not contain any threats,"" the police report continues, adding that the officer who wrote it told McBride ""the e-mail did not constitute an offense."" The report adds that a private company ""is doing private security work on location at the Journal News ... (the company's) employees are armed and will be on site ... through at least January 2, 2013."" FBI gun background checks hit record highs . The Journal News did not immediately respond Wednesday when asked by CNN for comment. The armed guards' presence at Journal News comes after gun-owning blogger Christopher Fountains posted the home addresses of newspaper staffers on his blog in response to the map, which was published online on December 22. Fountains spoke to CNN's ""Starting Point with Soledad O'Brien"" last week to explain his reasoning behind the posting. ""I felt they were using this (the interactive map showing gun permit-holders' addresses) to harass gun owners,"" Fountain said. ""So I harassed them back."" Fountain posted the name, home address and phone numbers of the Journal News' publisher, editor, visual editor and several other staff members. Fountain told CNN's ""Early Start"" that he was offended by the newspaper's actions and ""wondered how they would like it if their addresses were published.""

"(CNN) -- New York City is demanding that documentary filmmaker Ken Burns hand over footage of the movie he made about five men who were wrongfully imprisoned and later exonerated for the rape of a woman in Central Park. The demand is part of the city's attempt to defend itself against multi-million dollar federal lawsuits filed by some of the ""The Central Park Five,"" as the exonerated men had come to be known. Lawyers for New York City filed a subpoena demanding Burns and his production company, Florentine Films, give them the unpublished interviews and unreleased footage not used in the documentary, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May. ""The plaintiffs' interviews go to the heart of the case and cannot be obtained elsewhere,"" said Celeste Koeleveld, a city attorney. But Burns, along with his daughter, Sarah Burns, and her husband David McMahon, who co-wrote and produced the film, say they plan to fight. ""I'm sorry to say we saw this coming,"" said Burns. ""New York State shield laws are very specific. We are journalists, and that's what this is."" Burns was referring to state laws designed to protect journalists from having to compromise their sources. The filmmaker says he finds irony in the city's request for the footage because he says he and his crew had been trying to get city officials in front of the camera for interviews for years, but to no avail. ""We made every attempt, we practically begged to talk to prosecutors and police,"" he said. The shield law should not protect Burns and his collaborators because they have shown many times that they were advocates and not journalists, city officials say. For example, Sarah Burns worked for two years in the law firm of one of the plaintiffs' attorneys and Ken Burns wrote to Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2009, urging him to settle the case, writing the plaintiffs had ""suffered without just cause,"" the New York City law office says. ""Mr. Burns and his daughter have publicly sided with the plaintiffs and their families, who are seeking hundreds of millions from New York City,"" said Koeleveld, ""The movie has crossed from documentary to pure advocacy. Under such circumstances, no reasonable person could have expected us to participate in their project."" Burns, an Emmy-award winning filmmaker, disagrees. ""We didn't make an advocacy film; we made a film about the facts of the case and that is these men were wrongly convicted, and had years of their lives stolen,"" Burns said. ""One of the things that was stolen from these men was their humanity. In the media they were turned into wild beasts, a wolf pack, and we wanted to return their humanity. We'd have been happy to do the same to others involved, if prosecutors and police had returned our calls for interviews."" The racially charged Central Park Five case dates back to 1989. On April 19 of that year, a 28-year-old white Wall Street investment banker was jogging through Central Park when she was brutally assaulted, raped and left for dead. That same night a group of black and Latino boys had been in the park, throwing rocks at cars and assaulting people, ""wilding"" as it was called in the media at the time. 2003: Central Park jogger speaks out . In the ensuing months, the investigation lead to the arrest of five of the boys. They were charged and convicted. To many it seemed like an open and shut case. Four of the young men had given taped confessions, and despite defense claims the confessions were coerced, the prosecutors, police, and what seemed like much of the American public deemed them guilty. Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Kharey Wise and Kevin Richardson were convicted and sentenced to prison. In 2002, three of the convicted young men had finished their prison terms, one was on parole and the fifth was in jail on an unrelated offense when Matias Reyes, a serial rapist and murderer, confessed to the crime and said he acted alone. DNA analysis later determined that Reyes did rape the jogger and that hair evidence used in the boys' trials did not match. Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney at the time, ordered a new investigation and, on his recommendation, a judge vacated the convictions. Legal expert say the city may have a case. ""The evidence exists, the tapes and footage exists, and these people are suing the city, so you can see why the city would want to use them,"" said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffery Toobin.

"Madrid (CNN) -- It's a check for $2 million, issued to a man with a California driver's license. And it was found in a subway car in Madrid, police say. ""We have his name. We're trying to locate this person,"" a National Police spokesman in Madrid told CNN on Thursday. ""We won't just hand it over. We have to verify that the origin of the money is not illicit,"" said the spokesman, who by custom is not identified. The check was issued by Bank of America, and it's post-dated to January 2014, the spokesman said. A maintenance worker for Madrid's Metro, or subway system, found it Wednesday. A train running on line 5, which roughly traverses the capital from east to west, reported a problem with doors that wouldn't fully close at the Diego de Leon station. Homeless man turns in $40k, gets $91k . The train was sent to a maintenance yard, following protocol, and a worker who inspected the doors found a brown leather wallet that contained the $2 million check, the California driver's license and some credit cards, a Metro de Madrid spokeswoman said. ""It appears that the wallet was stolen on the Metro,"" the spokeswoman said. ""The thief looked inside, grabbed the cash -- but didn't see the check -- and then threw the wallet away."" Usually, these kinds of discarded stolen wallets end up on a station platform. But this one landed in the doorway of a Metro car, preventing it from closing properly, she said. Madrid's Metro handles an average of 2 million passengers a day, but this is believed to be the first time that one of them was carrying a $2 million check, the police spokesman said. Why would someone with such a large check be riding in the subway, instead of in a chauffeured car? Police would like to ask the owner of the check that question, too, the spokesman said. Police have contacted the U.S. Embassy in Madrid for help in finding the check's owner, but the embassy had no immediate comment.","A maintenance worker for Madrid's subway system found the check Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Edwin Velez used to have to suck in his stomach in order to tie his shoes. He requested tables at restaurants, rather than booths, and constantly made jokes about himself in order to hide how uncomfortable he was about his physical appearance. ""I may be big, but I'm sexy,"" he would say. But on the inside, Velez, an English-as-a-second-language teacher from Albertville, Alabama, really wanted to make a change. He attributes his weight struggles to eating habits he learned as a child. He grew up in a Latin family, with a diet consisting of rice, beans and plenty of fried food. His family moved from Puerto Rico to Florida when he was 4. When he was younger, Velez loved playing baseball, but after his sophomore year of high school he weighed 250 pounds and had to give up the sport because it exhausted him. In college, his eating habits worsened. Like many students, he ate whatever was readily available and cheap, such as cafeteria hamburgers, French fries and chicken fingers. By the time Velez reached adulthood, he weighed 310 pounds. It was not until he was reminiscing over photos from one spring trip to the Bahamas with friends that he realized he was significantly overweight. 'I couldn't walk': Woman loses 276 pounds . Velez set a goal to drop 100 pounds in a year's time before his next trip. He changed his diet, exercise routine and most importantly, his attitude. He began walking 45 minutes every morning and soon after was able to jog. ""It was only after I lost 30 to 40 pounds from jogging that I joined a gym,"" says Velez. ""It's intimidating."" Once there, he began lifting weights and building muscle to sculpt his ideal body. But ""it doesn't just happen at the gym, it happens after (the gym), too,"" Velez says. He cut out soda, sweets and carbohydrates while focusing on high-protein foods such as fish and chicken, pairing them with fruits and vegetables. Since Velez had never been a gym-goer or calorie counter, many people who knew him discouraged him from starting his weight loss journey. They told him he was working toward an unrealistic goal because of his past habits. Velez says that he's competitive and that their words fired his desire to prove everyone around him wrong. ""You really have to want it bad enough,"" says Velez. ""Once you get the mental part right, you can't let the negative Nancys get you down."" After a year and two months -- and 155 pounds lost -- he decided to reward himself with skin removal surgery. He now has plans to tone and sculpt his body to compete in men's physique competitions for the 2014 season. Velez says he has no problem maintaining his diet and exercise plan and that the temptation to eat unhealthy food is no longer present. He takes his own meals to work to ensure he sticks to his routine and sacrifices the candy he once had a sweet tooth for. Food was 'only relationship that mattered' After seeing Velez transform into a more confident and fit individual, his sister, Zorry Padilla, began her own healthy journey to shed the weight she gained after the birth of her children. ""I always had an excuse,"" says Padilla. Velez helped his sister lose 40 pounds in nine months by following the same meal plans he does. Padilla plans to run the next 5K in their area with her brother. ""Though I'm not a personal trainer, I know what it takes, and I want to help others as much as I can,"" Velez says. Long-time friend Angel Ramirez says he is amazed at Velez's life changes. ""On Facebook he has so many followers that are trying to do the same thing he did,"" says Ramirez. ""Every time he posts something, he's got instant feedback."" Velez says his outlook on life has been altered for the better; he now creates goals and sticks to them. He finds he is more confident in his own skin and his day-to-day decisions, unlike before when he would frequently change his mind and had low self-confidence. Velez says he was once known as ""the big goofy guy."" However, now, both Padilla and Ramirez say his jokes come in moderation because he doesn't need to hide behind his weight anymore. ""Drive, determination, discipline and dedication are the four D's to my success,"" Velez says.

"(CNN) -- A day after Mister Cee told listeners he was quitting his job at New York's Hot 97, the veteran hip-hop DJ was back on the air. ""Mister Cee, I'm back!"" he said. ""I'm humbled and blessed to be back in this building."" Cee -- whose real name is Calvin LeBrun -- was caught in a controversy involving an alleged car ride with a drag queen that was documented in a video posted on YouTube. ""I really feel like I let y'all down,"" Cee said in an interview on the station's morning show Thursday. CNN previously quoted similar comments made in an unverified Twitter account that the station says is not Cee's. Station spokeswoman Lindsay Salandra confirmed to CNN that Cee was working his air shift Thursday afternoon, but she said she had not heard from the general manager if he was back permanently. Hot 97 General Manager Alexandra Cameron, in a statement to CNN on Wednesday, said the station and Cee parted company after 20 years because of ""some personal circumstances that have become public."" ""We feel that this is in the best interest of both Hot 97 and Cee's personal well-being,"" Cameron said.Â  ""While we do not endorse the alleged activities, he is clearly facing a personal dilemma that is for him and only him to comment on."" Cee said in the interview Thursday that he was addicted to prostitutes and strippers. ""I am tired of trying to do something or be something that I am not,"" he said. Cee's resignation followed the posting on YouTube of a video in which a cross-dressing personality using the name Bimbo Winehouse plays an audio recording of a seven-minute encounter purportedly with Mister Cee. ""Have I lied about getting sexual fellatio in a car with a transsexual?"" he said. ""Yes, I have lied about that and I feel bad for the listeners that it did take a video for me to say this, because I have been in denial about this for a very long time."" He said the video was recorded nearly a year ago. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","NEW: Mister Cee returns to his job hours after quitting amid a sex scandal .

"(CNN) -- Were you hoping to spend the weekend viewing the beauty of the change of seasons at the Great Smoky Mountains? Are you one of the 24 couples who had a wedding planned on the National Mall in October? Did you plan to visit Half Dome on the 123rd anniversary of Yosemite's establishment in 1890? Unless something changes soon, you won't be able to do any of those things because of the federal government shutdown. The shutdown has closed the 401 National Park System sites across the country. Visitors will be turned away, gates will be shut, tens of thousands of employees will be furloughed and communities will lose millions of dollars a day. Only a few hundred yards from the congressional impasse, the National Mall and its Monument Parks in Washington now have a new feature: barricaded landmarks, including the Lincoln, FDR, Jefferson, World War II and MLK Jr. memorials. National Parks are often called ""America's Best Idea,"" and now they are symbols of political dysfunction. They are not the reason for our country's budget woes. But national parks and the people who rely on them-- visitors, school groups and businesses -- are once again collateral damage in a broken budget process. What's worse, many national parks have been forced to close during their peak visitation season, places such as Acadia National Park and Rocky Mountain National Park, where people go to enjoy the fall foliage. And many people wait till the cooler months to visit places such as the Grand Canyon and Death Valley. The potential loss of more than 750,000 daily visitors from around the world -- the number who typically visit national parks in October -- might cost local communities as much as $30 million each day the national parks are closed. The closure of America's crown jewels threatens the livelihood of park businesses, gateway communities and the American families within them, whose economies rely on national parks being open for business. Families, school groups and tourists from around the world who have made plans to visit and enjoy our national heritage will face disappointment. Opinion: In shutdown, GOP targets women -- again . Bar Harbor, Maine, adjacent to Acadia National Park, attracts nearly 10,000 visitors daily in October. The loss of these visitors could be shattering to a community that relies on that final flush of tourism dollars before the steep drop-off in winter. Chris Fogg, executive director of the Bar Harbor Chamber of Commerce, told me that with the impact of the sequester and the late opening of Acadia's roads, business was already down about 30% in April and May in comparison to the average over the last five years. ""We just can't believe that Congress is letting this happen,"" He said. But it is happening. All across the country. The federal government shutdown has made a bad situation even worse for our national parks. Over the past three years, the National Park Service's budget has been cut by 13%, or about $315 million. These cuts have already forced national park superintendents to delay the opening of parks or park roads; close visitor centers, picnic areas and campgrounds; decrease the number of rangers to protect and maintain parks; and limit the number of educational programs. Countless students across the country have been denied educational opportunities in national parks and opportunities that would shape their love of the outdoors and parks for the rest of their lives. We need Congress to do two things: Reopen our national parks and then restore the funding they lost because of the damaging sequester. Our national parks are treasured by Americans nationwide. The federal government has a responsibility to keep them open and adequately funded. Today, Yosemite's birthday has been spoiled for the American people and for tourists from around the world. We need Congress and the president to reopen our parks and reach a budget agreement that keeps America's greatest places protected and open from now on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Theresa Pierno.","Theresa Pierno: The federal government shutdown has closed the National Parks .
She says this means loss of millions to parks, businesses, nearby communities .

"(CNN) -- Mexico confirmed Tuesday that its forces killed Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, reputed boss of the ruthless Zetas cartel, but it remains uncertain what effect, if any, the killing will have on the larger scourge of drug trafficking and violence. The kingpin's death is arguably the Mexican government's biggest takedown since President Felipe Calderon launched an offensive six years ago, but the record is mixed on the impact of such successes. Mexican marines killed Lazcano in a shootout on Sunday in a small town in northern Mexico, 130 miles from the Texas border, the country's navy said. Lazcano was a onetime special forces soldier who became a founding member of the Zetas, a group accused of some of the most violent atrocities that have come to define the drug wars. Another Zetas leader arrested in Falcon Lake killing . In a twist, a group of armed men stole Lazcano's body from a funeral home, though authorities had already taken fingerprints and photographs to confirm his identity. Lazcano's death ""certainly weakens dramatically the Zetas,"" said George Grayson, professor of government at the College of William & Mary and author of a book on the cartel. The death is the latest in a string of blows against its leadership, he said. Other analysts said it was unclear how Lazcano's death would affect the Zetas. ""Even though the head falls, there is immediately a substitute,"" said Anabel Hernandez, a Mexican journalist who has investigated the country's cartels. The intelligence firm Stratfor said it expects Lazcano's death to have little impact on the Zetas' operations. Lazcano's health had been failing and he had already transferred much control of the organization to Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, Stratfor said. The United States and Mexico combined had offered rewards of more than $7 million for information leading to his capture. Praising the navy's efforts Tuesday, Calderon described Lazcano as ""one of the most important and most dangerous"" people on Mexico's list of most wanted criminals. The organization he led, Calderon said, is behind ""countless high-impact crimes and extreme violence that many communities in the country have suffered."" The Zetas are responsible for smuggling tons of cocaine and other drugs annually to the United States, generating many millions of dollars. The name of the cartel conjures up some of the most violent images of the drug war: a casino fire that killed 52 people, the deaths of 72 migrants, and tortured bodies hanging from bridges. 7 bodies found in western Mexico . The marines who killed Lazcano had responded Sunday to reports of an armed group in the town of Progreso, in the northern state of Coahuila, the navy said. They were attacked with grenades thrown from a moving vehicle and a firefight ensued, it said. A local newspaper reported scenes of ""panic and terror"" as the shootout erupted next to where families were enjoying a baseball game. Rather than after an ambush, the shooting started after the marines tried to search a suspicious Ford Ranger, the Zocalo newspaper said. Authorities at the scene recovered two assault rifles, a grenade launcher and 12 grenades, as well as a rocket launcher and two rockets. The Zetas -- headquartered in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, directly across the border from Laredo, Texas -- make up Mexico's largest drug cartel in terms of territory. The group has operations in 11 Mexican states. Another reputed Zetas leader, Ivan Velazquez Caballero, alias ""El Taliban,"" was captured last month. Lazcano, 37, joined the Mexican armed forces in 1991 and was part of its elite airborne special forces group, dedicated to battling drug cartels. Soon after, Lazcano and several other special forces members were recruited by the Gulf cartel to create its enforcement arm, Los Zetas. Gulf Cartel boss arrested . In ensuing years, the Zetas split into a major drug trafficking organization and have since branched out into extortion, kidnapping and human smuggling. The cartel is in the midst of a bloody turf war with its former employer, the Gulf cartel, and also with the Sinaloa cartel. The fight for access to lucrative smuggling routes in northern and central Mexico has left thousands of civilians dead. The violence is particularly acute in three northeastern states that are some of the Zetas' strongest-held territory: Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. In 2010, the bodies of 72 migrants from Central and South America were discovered at a ranch in Tamaulipas state. The Zetas have been blamed for the mass graves and for the deaths of the migrants. The cartel also is blamed for setting a fire at a casino in Monterrey that killed 52 people. In May, authorities found 49 decapitated and dismembered bodies along a highway in Nuevo Leon. The orders to commit the grisly crime allegedly came from Lazcano, who originally wanted the bodies to be left in a town's central square. In banners purportedly hung by the cartel, the group denied involvement. Mexican officials have said that more than 47,500 people have been killed in drug-related violence since Calderon began his crackdown on cartels in December 2006. Some groups say the number is much higher. 45 days of intel work led to drug lord's capture in Venezuela . CNN's Ben Brumfield, Lonzo Cook and Nelson Quinones in Atlanta, and journalist Victor Badillo in Coahuila state, Mexico, contributed to this report.","The navy confirms the death of Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano .

"(CNN) -- Karachi, the financial heart of Pakistan, was shut down Wednesday because of political tension that followed various incidents of violence sparked by the arrest of a prominent politician in a crackdown on crime. Nine people, including two policemen, were reported killed in the violence Tuesday. Trade suffered as shuttered shops and burning buses dotted parts of the city's landscape. Only last week newly elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had visited the country's largest and most populous city to ensure political unity in tackling the scourge of militant-backed crime rings and politically affiliated gangs. There had been a rare show of inter-party unity backing the new government's drive to send Pakistan's paramilitary force, The Pakistan Rangers, into Karachi. But recent events could throw a wrench into this process as the arrest of a former member of parliament from the city's prominent MQM party has been linked to the death of the two policemen. Speaking to CNN from London, MQM spokesman Muhammad Anwar called the incident ""a travesty of justice"" and said the Rangers' operation is politically motivated with a bias toward the PPP, former President Asif Ali Zardari's party, which now holds a majority in the provincial government of Sindh, where Karachi is located. The operation started Thursday. According to information released by the Interior Ministry in the past 24 hours, three of the city's most wanted alleged target killers have been arrested. Omar Hamid Khan, a spokesman for the interior minister, told CNN that the hostile reaction to the arrest is ""temporary"" and that there will always be ""hiccups"" but ""the objectivity of the operation will not be lost sight of.""","Nine people, including two policemen, were reported killed in violence Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- It took just two ""immortal words"" for the chairman of a leading Australian media group to whip up hundreds more in print and online in the Australian press on Tuesday. Those words were ""S-H-I-T happens,"" a phrase the chairman of Southern Cross Austereo (SCA) later reportedly dismissed as ""a comment in one sentence"" and ""everyday parlance in Australia."" The problem was those words were uttered, with the first spelled out, in response to a shareholder question about whether the company had a ""cultural problem"" as evidenced partly by the ""UK incident."" The ""UK incident"" refers to the apparent suicide of 46-year-old British nurse Jacintha Saldanha, three days after two Austereo DJs made a prank call to the hospital treating the then-pregnant Duchess of Cambridge. Using poor impersonations of Queen Elizabeth II and the Prince of Wales, Mel Greig and Michael Christian called the hospital switchboard and managed to talk to someone with knowledge of the Duchess' medical condition. It later emerged that Saldanha was the nurse who put them through. READ MORE: Who was nurse Jacintha Saldanha? On Wednesday, the company issued a statement alleging that Max Moore-Wilton's comments to a room full of shareholders at the company's annual general meeting in Melbourne were ""taken out of context."" It added that Moore-Wilton ""would like to emphasize that his words should not be read as his or the company's lack of concern or sympathies towards those who have been involved in the Royal prank call issue."" It included a full transcript of the question and answer: . Shareholder Question: . ""Just in relation to Eddie and King Kong, Kyle and obviously the UK incident, do we have a cultural problem?"" Max Moore-Wilton Answer: . ""I think it's fair to say that those incidents were very unfortunate, there is no doubt about that. In each particular case we thoroughly investigated them and it comes generally within the context of some of these incidents where a whole series of events come together and in the immortal words of somebody who I forget, S-H-I-T happens."" The answer goes on to address the ""Kyle"" question, a reference to shock jock Kyle Sandilands whose no-holds-barred approach to the discipline has long outraged and offended listeners. Moore-Wilton didn't separately address the portion of the question regarding ""Eddie and King Kong,"" a reference to presenter Eddie McGuire who suggested on air that a star AFL player should be used to promote the King Kong musical. The comment was widely interpreted to mean he was calling him an ape. In regard to what he called the ""United Kingdom incident,"" Moore-Wilton said ""that is still ongoing."" ""The Coroner's court hearings in London have been delayed. I understand because further investigations are taking place in India. We however, have put in place again, procedures to ensure that such a situation will not happen again. ""We of course have legal proceedings in place. We do not believe that we are in breach of any of the codes and that those matters will go forward but no doubt they did reflect the need to tighten up our procedures and the board and the management have taken considerable time and effort to ensure we've tightened up those procedures"" -- SCA statement . 'An insult to a loving mother' In the UK, British lawmaker Keith Vaz issued a statement saying he was ""shocked"" by Moore-Wilton's comments. ""This is an insult to the memory of a loving mother and wife. The radio station has clearly not learnt the lessons from this incident. Mr Moore-Wilton must apologise for his comments immediately."" Moore-Wilton reportedly fired back, urging Vaz to look at the transcript of his comments rather than ""listening to the truncated and sensationalist reports of the Australian media."" He told the Australian Associated Press the phrase was ""entirely Australian. I don't know whether it's British but it's certainly ... been used by many Australians to express a point of view. ""I'm not here to be censored for my use of a word which is common in everyday parlance in Australia. If you don't like it, or the media don't like it, well that's fine."" Outrage over prank call . The call, made in December 2012, provoked international outrage. Social media seethed with scorn for the two presenters who appeared tearful in television interviews when they dared to come out of hiding. ""I'm very sorry and saddened for the family, and I can't imagine what they've been going through,"" Greig said on the program ""Today Tonight."" Christian described himself as ""gutted, shattered and heartbroken."" READ MORE: Two presenters apologize for prank call . The two presenters were taken off air, their show canceled and all advertising suspended. However, just six months later, Austereo bosses announced they were thrilled that Christian had won a national competition to find the ""next top jock."" Greig is yet to return to air and has filed a legal claim against 2DayFM, for failing to provide a safe workplace in relation to the prank call. In September, 2DayFM took the Australian Communications and Media Authority to the Federal Court, alleging that it didn't have the authority to reach a preliminary finding that the station breached the Surveillance Devices Act 2007. The ACMA has not publicly released the findings of its investigation but provided 2DayFM with a preliminary copy. The court is still considering its verdict.","Southern Cross Austereo chairman shocks with flippant comment .

"(Financial Times) -- BT has achieved its biggest sporting coup yet over Sky, winning the rights to show Champions League football matches in a £900 million ($1,442 million) deal. The deal, announced on Saturday, strikes at the heart of two decades of football broadcasting dominance by Sky. However, it is likely to raise questions about whether BT is paying too much for sports rights, to which it has now committed nearly £2 billion ($3.2 billion). The Champions League is Europe's football premier club competition, and BT, Sky and ITV had all hoped to secure some coverage in this week's tender. Under a three-year agreement starting in 2015, BT will be the only broadcaster to show live Champions League and Europa League games in the UK, paying £299 million ($479 million) per season. That is more than double what Sky and ITV currently pay for the same rights, suggesting that BT bid aggressively under its new chief executive Gavin Patterson. In the tender, ITV is thought to have bid about £63 million ($101 million) per season to show one live game per round, representing an increase of less than one-fifth on its current deal. Sky was prepared to increase its payments by a greater proportion, but could not match BT. ""It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation,"" a Sky spokesperson said in a statement. ""If we thought it was worth more, we'd have paid more."" TV is part of BT's broader strategy to win customers to its premium fibre broadband packages, which include the sports channels for free at present. The Champions League deal will significantly bolster its channels as serious rivals to Sky in the eyes of viewers and advertisers. BT's shareholders will be keen to see clear returns from such significant investments from a group that has previously focused on cutting costs and streamlining its operations. The group last week revealed a good start in customer numbers, with about 2m people so far having signed up to its channels although the majority would have been existing BT customers. However, the sports rights acquisitions weighed on earnings, and analysts say it is still too early to judge the new sports TV strategy a success. ITV, which was also outbid for rights to FA Cup games by the BBC, had hoped that Uefa would continue to offer some rights to terrestrial television, where advertisers can garner a larger audience. BT has pledged to make some games, including the Champions League final, available free even to those who do not have its pay TV platform. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","The BT deal strikes at the heart of two decades of football broadcasting dominance by Sky .

"(CNN) -- Millions of BlackBerry users remained without service on Wednesday as a three-day network outage spread to North America, causing massive frustrations for people who rely on these smartphones for business and personal communications. ""BlackBerry subscribers in the Americas may be experiencing intermittent service delays this morning,"" Research in Motion, maker of BlackBerry smartphones, said in a statement. ""We are working to resolve the situation as quickly as possible and we apologize to our customers for any inconvenience. We will provide a further update as soon as more information is available."" The outage now impacts people on nearly every continent, according to the company's statements. An ""extremely critical issue"" on the BlackBerry network caused the outage, Stephen Bates, RIM's managing director in the U.K., told CNN's Richard Quest. He added: ""We're putting all of our focus with all of our engineers and all of our network specialists on trying to understand the nature of why this backup system didn't work as it should have ..."" The service outage started on Monday with customers in the Middle East, Europe and Africa, before spreading to South America and Asia on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning it appeared to hit the United States and Canada. The outage appears primarily to affect text messaging and Internet access from the mobile phones, not necessarily their ability to place calls. No customer e-mails have been completely lost, and they will be delivered eventually, RIM said in a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, according to CNNMoney's Julianne Pepitone. CNNMoney: RIM can't win . In a statement released Tuesday, the company said the ""messaging and browsing delays being experienced by BlackBerry users in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, India, Brazil, Chile and Argentina were caused by a core switch failure within RIM's infrastructure. Although the system is designed to failover to a back-up switch, the failover did not function as previously tested."" The company said it is working ""around the clock"" to fix the problem. ""A large backlog of data was generated and we are now working to clear that backlog and restore normal service as quickly as possible,"" the Tuesday statement said. ""We apologize for any inconvenience and we will continue to keep you informed."" There are about 70 million BlackBerry users worldwide. RIM has not commented on how many users are affected, but reports suggest the number of users without some sort of service has climbed into the millions. BlackBerry users, many of whom use the devices primarily for business purposes, were angered by the outage. Overheard on CNN.com: BlackBerry outage not all bad . Many people took to Twitter to both complain about lost productivity and to make light of the situation. ""COME ONNNN. Sort it out #blackberry. This is ridiculous in this day and age,"" a Twitter user named @Suzy__G wrote. ""OK, this #Blackberry business is now SERIOUSLY pissing me off,"" CNN's Piers Morgan tweeted.

""#DearBlackberry I can't work, I can't study, please, please come back from that coma!"" @marianaae wrote. ""What did the one #Blackberry user say to the other?..........nothing....,"" said another Twitter user, @giselewaymes. ""And iPhone users everywhere smile smugly and search for the 'I Told You So' app,"" wrote another. A website called isblackberrystillbroken.com popped up to track developments. People who visited the site on Wednesday afternoon were greeted with a red screen and a giant word: ""Yes."" This is not the first time RIM has faced a major service outage. ""I have been an analyst for 25 years and have watched RIM wrestle with this same outage problem time after time. Every few years we get pinched by yet another major problem,"" tech analyst Jeff Kagan said in a statement. Is the outage affecting you? This outage, however, comes at a particularly bad time for RIM, since it faces increasing competition in the smarpthone market, Kagan says. Apple's iPhone and phones on the Google Android operating system have been gaining ground, and the new iPhone 4S goes on sale Friday. The tech blog Electronista wrote: . ""RIM's outage is now one of its largest in recent memory and is now edging even closer to the iPhone 4S launch than before, leading to a possible temptation for those already looking to upgrade their phones.

"(CNN) -- One of two convicted murderers who allegedly used forged documents to walk out of Franklin Correctional Institution in North Carrabelle, south of Tallahassee, was ordered Wednesday held without bond on an escape charge and sent back to the prison. Wearing a dark jumpsuit, Charles Walker nodded several times in response to questions during his 65-second appearance in the 9th Judicial Circuit Court of Florida, in Orlando. No hearing has been announced for the second man, Joseph Jenkins. After days on the lam, Walker and Jenkins were recaptured Saturday night at Panama City's Coconut Grove Motor Inn, some 360 miles northwest of the Orlando area. Friend tipped off police to whereabouts of escaped inmates . They were booked Tuesday in Orange County, Florida, the place from which both men hail and where the murders they are responsible for took place. Walker and Jenkins, both 34, had been serving life terms without parole at Franklin for unrelated killings. Jenkins escaped on September 27, while Walker left October 8. Both men used legal-looking documents bearing bogus signatures, including those of the Orlando-area state attorney and Judge Belvin Perry, plus the seal of the Orange County clerk of court's office, officials said. Courts, corrections deflect blame . State officials have been investigating such scams for about a year and had warned prosecutors about the schemes over the summer, said Jerry Bailey, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's commissioner. On Tuesday, Bailey's agency announced that a reward of up to $10,000 was being offered for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the forgeries or the escapes.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In most households, photo albums sit on shelves or in drawers for years on end collecting dust. Jonas Cuarón, son of Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón, with his girlfriend, Eireann Harper, who starred in ""Año Uña."" Jonás Cuarón has put his own to much better use -- the 25-year-old son of Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón has turned his collection of family photographs into a feature film. During the making of ""Año Uña,"" Cuarón walked around, camera in hand for a period of twelve months, randomly capturing scenes from his personal life. At the end of the year he and his girlfriend Eireann Harper mounted thousands of these images in a room and wrote a fictional story to accompany them. The final product is a most unusual film -- a montage of stills, brought to life through a mixture of dialogue, narration and sound effects. The story is that of an impossible love relationship between a 24-year-old American girl (Harper) and a Mexican teenager played by Jonás' half-brother, Diego Cataño. ""A common thing I hear from people who have seen the movie, is that the first five minutes they're very worried that they'll have to sit through eighty minutes of photographs,"" Cuarón explained to CNN, ""But then by minute seven they forget they're watching stills and become engaged with the characters."" Watch Jonás Cuarón talking about ""Ano Uno."" Amongst those engrossed by ""Año Uña"" are some of contemporary Mexican cinema's most iconic figures. The likes of Alejandro González Iñárritu and Gael García Bernal have championed the film for its originality. While Jonás' family ties have undoubtedly been of much use in promoting ""Año Uña"" amongst the great and good of Mexican cinema, his father's influence on the film itself is minimal. Although Alfonso is credited as its producer, the renowned director knew nothing of the project during its production. ""Jonás showed me the final film and I said 'Yikes! Look at that. You made a film. Show it to people you trust like Alejandro González Iñárritu , Guillermo del Toro, just for feedback.' That was as far as the consultancy went,"" Alfonso Cuarón told CNN. Father and son worked together previously on ""The Shock Doctrine,"" a political short film released on YouTube. Unlike ""Año Uña,"" the project involved a more traditional form of collaboration between Jonás as director Alfonso as producer. When asked about their working relationship, Alfonso's response is filled with enthusiasm: ""Usually one of us throws an idea and the other catches it and throws it back. It's telepathic in a way, we learn a lot from each other. ""Something that really fascinates me, not only about Jonás, but his entire generation, is how they work with their formats."" Indeed, Jonás' ambition to break with the conventions of filmmaking is in line with a trend emerging amongst young filmmakers not only in Mexico, but across the world. According to Jonás this willingness to experiment is rooted in technological advances: ""[In the past] filmmakers had really complicated screenplays and they would wait for grants and finance support. ""Now since video is not as expensive, people are starting to go out and film reality without a script, and then out of that reality, editing it and finding the story as they go."" In order to give such creative talent more exposure, the Cuaróns recently launched a competition -- the 'Año Uña' Short Film Competition -- that challenges young filmmakers to step in Jonas' footsteps. Aspiring writers and directors are encouraged to submit an ""Año Uña""-like short film made entirely from photographic stills. The winning submission will be screened at the premiere of ""Año Uña"" later this month. In addition to promoting his own film, Jonás is convinced that the contest will create opportunities for his peers: ""I'm thrilled that this short film competition will open doors for filmmakers to play with new languages and demonstrate that the creative process of filmmaking can be more accessible than is often assumed."" Despite Jonás' position at the helm of this innovative community, he says would like to try using more traditional methods on his next film project. ""Well, next time I would like to start with a screenplay and shoot 24 frames per second,"" he says with a smile, ""I don't think that you necessarily need to go as far as using still images to find new languages in film."" Jonás may be laying the family photo album aside but the family legacy looks set to thrive regardless. With not one, but three Cuaróns (Alfronso's brother Carlos is also a filmmaker) mixing up the cinematic landscape, filmmaking may well be in for a make-over.

"(CNN) -- Sometimes, it pays to read between the lines. At least that may be the message --and, more accurately, the hope -- of workers at the National Weather Service office in Anchorage, Alaska. The message can be found in an official forecast put out at 5 a.m. (9 a.m. ET) that seems, at first glance, routine with its discussion of air pressure, wind speeds and weather systems. But if you line up the first letters of each word from top-to-bottom in the forecast, under the heading ""Analysis and Upper levels,"" there's something else there: P-L-E-A-S-E-P-A-Y-U-S. That breaks down into three simple words: Please pay us. Meteorologists at the service's Anchorage office declined Friday afternoon to comment on the possibly cryptic wording, saying they can only speak about weather-related matters. It was not immediately clear who exactly put out the forecast or whether a message was intentionally tucked into it. Still, it's no secret that National Weather Service employees -- like other federal government employees -- aren't getting paid as long as the government is shut down. That began Tuesday and there has been no indication that it will end anytime soon, with Democrats and Republicans holding firm on their positions that the other is to blame and that they won't budge. Up to 800,000 federal workers are at risk of furlough, meaning they won't report to work until the sides agree on a spending plan that President Barack Obama signs into law. Other federal employees are still working, because what they do is considered essential by the government. That includes many at the National Weather Service. Whenever the shutdown ends, these government workers should get back-pay. But there's no telling when that will happen, meaning they could work for days, weeks or months before they take home a paycheck. CNN's Kevin Wang contributed to this report.","A National Weather Service's Anchorage office forecast may have a subliminal message .

"(CNN) -- A seventh person has been confirmed dead, and the number of presumed dead is now up to three after last week's flooding in Colorado, authorities reported Thursday. The state Office of Emergency Management added a new confirmed fatality in Boulder County to the list Thursday afternoon, spokeswoman Micki Trost said. And in Larimer County, a 46-year-old man from the town of Drake whose home had been washed away was reclassified as presumed dead, said Nick Christensen, executive officer of the county Sheriff's Office. Two other people in Larimer County -- both women, ages 60 and 80 -- were already presumed dead after their homes were swept away in the flash floods that ravaged Colorado's northern Front Range. Another 139 people remain unaccounted for in Larimer County, a figure reduced from nearly 200 on Wednesday, Christensen said. Officials say most of those unaccounted for are expected to be alive and well, but have failed to check in with authorities to let them know. The mountains north of Denver saw more than nine inches of rain on September 12 -- leading to flash floods that turned picturesque canyons into funnels that deluged towns downstream and left hundreds stranded in the mountains above. Nearly 1,200 people had been airlifted out of the mountains by Thursday, and Christensen said nearly 200 more have chosen to stay in their homes. In addition to the deaths, nearly 18,000 homes have been damaged statewide. Gov. John Hickenlooper told reporters that about 200 miles of state highways washed out by the storms will need to be fixed, along with perhaps ""several times more"" miles of local roads. How to help . Those roads are not only in hard-hit Boulder and Larimer counties but in farm communities northeast of Denver, where the runoff from the storms was carried downstream by the South Platte River. And he added, ""It's clear we're in a race against the onset of winter."" ""Critical roads needed to bring in crops that are about to go to harvest are completely broken apart,"" Hickenlooper said. ""This has to be every bit as critical a priority as the roads connecting people with their communities and homes in the canyons. Irrigation, in large measure, has been washed away along the Platte."" The disaster may end up costing homeowners, businesses and local governments nearly $2 billion, according to the insurance consulting firm Eqecat -- and a high percentage of the losses will not be covered by insurance. Tom Larsen, senior vice president of of Eqecat, said that because very many of the homes damaged by the flooding are not in flood plains, the number of people with federal flood coverage is very low. Colorado is also an oil-producing state, and the disaster has raised concerns that hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" fluids used in oil and gas wells may have been swept up in the floodwaters and washed into the environment. Colorado's Oil and Gas Association, the industry's trade association, said no fracking operations were underway when the floods hit -- meaning ""no fracking fluids, no chemicals associated with fracking, nor equipment were on sites at the time of the flooding."" But state inspectors reported 10 oil spills as of Thursday, including two the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission called ""notable"" -- a 125-barrel (3,900-gallon) leak from a storage tank south of Milliken, near the South Platte; and a 323-barrel (13,500 gallon) leak from another storage tank near Firestone, on the St. Vrain River. ""In both cases, it appears the oil left the site in floodwaters,"" the commission reported. It said the spills were ""promptly reported"" by the tanks' owners, Anadarko Petroleum, and Anadarko said it was working with state and federal officials ""to clean up the releases to the greatest extent possible."" And the state agency noted that oil is typically a small portion of the contaminants associated with a flood: ""Those include very large volumes (millions of gallons) of raw, municipal sewage and other hazards associated with households, agriculture, business and industry.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy on Friday suspended two senior military intelligence officers' access to classified materials in connection with an investigation into alleged illegal and improper relations with a defense contractor. Classified access was suspended for Vice Adm.Ted Branch, director of Naval Intelligence, and Rear Adm. Bruce Loveless, director of Intelligence Operations, according to Rear Adm. John F. Kirby, Navy chief of information. Kirby said the decision to suspend their classified access was made based upon the nature of allegations against Branch and Loveless in connection with an ongoing Naval Criminal Investigative Service investigation. The NCIS is investigating possible illegal and improper relations with Navy contractor Leonard Francis, a Malaysian citizen and CEO of Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd. There is no indication, nor do the allegations suggest that there was any breach of classified information, Kirby said. Neither Branch nor Loveless has been charged with any crime or violation. Both retain their ranks and security clearances. They are on temporary leave. Kirby said the suspension was deemed prudent given the sensitive nature of the admirals' current duties and to protect the integrity of the investigative process, . The allegations against Branch and Loveless involve conduct prior to their current assignments and flag officer ranks, Kirby said. NCIS initiated the investigation in 2010. ""We will continue to make public as much information as we can without prejudicing the conduct of this investigation,"" Kirby said in a statement. On Wednesday, Cmdr. Jose Luis Sanchez, 41, was arrested in Florida and faces charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, according to the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego. He was the third Navy official has been charged in a case accusing them of accepting prostitution and other services from Francis in exchange for business and favorable treatment, according to the attorney's office. Francis was arrested earlier this year in San Diego. Federal prosecutors allege Sanchez, as deputy logistics officer in the U.S. 7th Fleet and later as the Fleet Logistics Command's operations director, directed Navy business and sensitive information to Francis' company, which provides security, supplies and other services to U.S. Navy ships at various ports. In return, Francis gave Sanchez more than $100,000, travel expenses and prostitutes during a period covering January 2009 to April 2013, the U.S. attorney's office said. Third Navy official arrested in bribery case . Two other Navy officials -- Cmdr. Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz and Naval Criminal Investigative Service Supervisory Special Agent John Bertrand Beliveau II -- were arrested in probes involving Francis' company in September. According to federal prosecutors, Misiewicz, 46, as deputy operations officer of the U.S. 7th Fleet, helped schedule visits of U.S. Navy ships to ports where Francis' company worked. ""In return, Francis provided Misiewicz with paid travel, luxury hotel stays and prostitution services,"" the San Diego U.S. attorney's office said. The information Misiewicz passed on to Francis was ""confidential,"" meaning its disclosure could cause serious harm to U.S. national security, the U.S. attorney's office said. It detailed Navy ship movements months in advance, according to the U.S. attorney. A separate complaint alleges Beliveau, 44, provided Francis with information about an NCIS fraud investigation into his company's dealings with the Navy. ""In exchange, Francis provided Beliveau with, among other things, paid travel, luxury hotel stays and prostitution services,"" the U.S. attorney's office said. No evidence was found that Beliveau paid for his hotel or travel, or that he reimbursed Francis for the trip. Francis also arranged for a female escort to entertain Beliveau while there, according to the complaint. In return, Francis allegedly saved 125 NCIS investigative reports to his government computer. The affidavit states the reports were in connection with the NCIS investigation into Glenn Defense Marine Asia -- Francis' company. Francis, Sanchez, Misiewicz and Beliveau are charged with conspiring to commit bribery and could face up to five years in prison if convicted.","Navy suspends classified access of Vice Adm.

"Western Cape, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africa has an energy deficit on its hands. Too many people want fuel for their cars and electricity for their homes, and the country is struggling to keep up with demand. To help ease this perceived crisis the big companies want to start drilling for natural gas using a controversial drilling technique called fracking. Under the plans the drilling will be done in one of the most remote and beautiful places in South Africa, the Karoo. Fracking has caused controversy and protests across the globe, and South Africa is no exception. To release the natural gas the companies drill down and sideways into a rock called shale, and pump large quantities of water and other chemicals to release the gas. Anti-fracking campaigners warn that this could have an irrevocable impact on this semi-desert region. Jonathan Deal has written a book on the Karoo and he is now leading the campaign against fracking. ""It is a special place, it is irreplaceable"" he told CNN, just outside the town of Sutherland in the Karoo. ""My concern is that we would make decisions chasing fossil fuels in this country where this generation is making a decision that is going to affect unborn generations who would not be happy about it, when we should perhaps be pursuing renewable energies or looking at different energy mixes."" Muna Lakhani from Earthlife Africa warns that water in the area could become contaminated as a result of fracking. ""The chances of damaging aquifers is very high and South Africa is a water scarce country,"" he told CNN in Cape Town. ""The Karoo happens to be the driest part of our country so to threaten our water supply with a system that uses massive amounts of water that can never be cleaned up, that contains toxic chemicals, seems to be insanity of the first order,"" he added. Read more: Explain to me: Fracking . Shell South Africa, one of the main companies lobbying to begin fracking, denies there is any ""insanity."" Bonang Mohale, the company's chairman, told CNN's Robyn Curnow, that: ""It is possible to have responsible fracking with respect to the environment and to the people of the Karoo."" ""The first commitment that we made was never to compete with the people of the Karoo for their water needs in this pristine and ecologically sensitive area so we, in the initial stages, certainly when we drill the first well, bring portable water in from outside."" ""The risks to the environment are well understood, well articulated and I think they can be totally and utterly mitigated, especially the issues of water contamination, the aquifers, and the scarcity of water."" Sutherland is a small town on the edge of the area that could be affected by fracking. It is so small you can stand on one side of the town and see straight down the main road to the other side. But despite its literal size, it has a big reputation because of its internationally recognized astronomical observatory. Tourists and scientists flock here but even so, the place is quiet. Jurgens Wagener runs a bed and breakfast in Sutherland and every evening he takes his guests into the Karoo to see the bright canopy of stars. He acknowledges that the town needs jobs but he is worried about the long term impact of fracking on his community. ""In the ten years we have been here I can say that it developed very much into a tourist attraction. We are just very concerned that if fracking does take place, there might be a boom for a very short period but what is it going to be like after that?"" According to a recent report by a South African think tank, paid for by Shell, the whole of South Africa and towns like Sutherland will get an economic boost if fracking goes ahead. ""The successful development of the shale gas reserves would result in approximately $11 billion to $30 billion contribution to the South African GDP"", Rob Jeffrey from Econometrix told CNN. ""In South African terms that is between three and 10% of South Africa's GDP, it is enormous. By the same token there would be a significant impact on employment."" But others believe Econometrix's employment figures have been exaggerated. See also: Fracking in New York: Risk vs. Reward . ""The aspect of the report that I most disagree with deals with the jobs numbers"", Peet Du Plooy, an economist with the Trade and Industrial Policy Strategies told CNN. ""The report cites 700,000 jobs, which is more jobs than the entire mining sector combined. I can understand the motivation to cite such a high number but I don't think it is realistic."" In America, the debate over fracking is just as fractured. In Ohio there have been accusations that fracking causes earthquakes and water has become so contaminated that it can be set on fire. In France protests by anti-fracking campaigners and some politicians has resulted in the drilling technique being banned altogether. Campaigners in South Africa argue that the lack of international and scientific consensus on the economic benefits and environmental impact of fracking mean it should not be allowed in the Karoo. Shell argues that they are pushing for fracking to begin because they want a new source of energy to help solve the country's energy crisis. ""We are up to solving the vexing challenge that South Africa has and that challenge is that of the 50 million South Africans, 20% of this population has absolutely no access to energy whatsoever,"" Bonang Mohale, Shell South Africa's Chairman told CNN. ""That's 10 million South Africans,"" he continued. ""They are the ones that have been busy chopping down our forests just to heat themselves and to cook and we are saying the case for gas is absolutely compelling because gas is much better as far as the environment is concerned than coal-fired power stations."" The South African government has stopped licensing for fracking while it studies all the arguments. The fate of the Karoo, South Africa's most fragile landscape, could be decided by the end of March.","Energy companies plan to start drilling for natural gas to help ease energy deficit in South Africa.

"(CNN) -- When Julia Kozerski saw a camera, she would duck and dodge out of the way. She'd hide behind other people or offer to take the picture to avoid being photographed. ""It was an embarrassment, somebody having that photograph,"" she said, who at her heaviest weighed 338 pounds. ""They told the truth. It haunts you."" But when Kozerski got married in 2009, she had to face the camera for obvious reasons, as every bride does. ""I hadn't taken a photo in 10 years,"" she said. When she saw her wedding pictures, Kozerski said, ""I didn't see that happiness. I saw someone scared of the camera -- that wasn't me."" Her inhibitions about being photographed are upended in her self-portraits chronicling her weight-loss, called ""Half."" See Kozerski's self-portraits . In a society where perfection and Photoshop are givens, Kozerski disrobes and photographs herself just the way she is -- no makeup, no clothes, no hairstyles, no computer tricks to nip and tuck. In the series, a somber Kozerski faces a mirror, a scale in another scene, and a refrigerator stocked with food -- ""They serve as reflections of my experience and address and explore my physically and emotionally painful, private struggles with food, obsession, self-control, and self-image,"" the photography student at the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design wrote on her website. She came from a family with a history of weight problems and grew up on fast food. The family made halfhearted attempts to lose weight and tried Slim Fast shakes and Weight Watchers, but these efforts fizzled. ""I don't think we knew the steps to take, we had never been introduced to diets or proper food,"" she said. At school, she never felt like she fit in and began shopping at plus-size stores during middle school. By the time Kozerski got married, her body mass index was 49.9 -- a BMI over 30 is considered obese. When she saw her wedding photos, that was the last straw. She woke up one day and told herself, ""I'm done being sad."" She started a weight-loss blog and used a free online calorie counter. She kicked the habits of eating out and drinking soda, and picked up more fruits and vegetables. Her exercises started with small steps -- walking her dog every day, taking stairs instead of the elevator and parking far away from the store. As she shed weight, Kozerski chose her project for her photography class. She started with close-up shots of her back, her abdomen. These were faceless photographs that she brought to class. ""It was shocking in a way that provoked conversation,"" Kozerski said. ""This is a story people relate to and talk about. I was just being as honest as I can. It becomes less about my experience and more about this greater story."" Everyone has something to hide that he or she is embarrassed about, Kozerski said. And here she was showing body parts that women tried to hide. She gradually started showing her face in the photographs. Her husband, family and friends wanted to know why she'd put revealing images of herself into the public sphere. About her husband, Kozerski said, ""He began to understand the emotions, although I couldn't verbalize them. He realized it's more universal."" Her photos show her in distraught, hopeless and difficult moments. There are tears in her eyes. ""It's an internal struggle, this whole thing -- it just bottled up. I couldn't express myself, even through the photos,"" Kozerski said. She called certain photos of her naked body ""casing"" or ""ruins."" The way Kozerski presented her journey is ""revealing in every way,"" said body image expert Robyn Silverman. Society has a definitive view of what it means to be fat. People associate the word ""thin"" with positive words like popular, sexy, and controlled. With the word ""fat,"" they associate traits like laziness, ugliness, lack of control in a way that ""the term fat is no longer a descriptor of weight and size, but an assessment of character,"" Silverman said. The words Kozerski uses to describe her body -- like ""ruins"" -- still serve as ""a reminder of the feeling of worthlessness, not being good enough"" and how she and others who are overweight or obese struggle with these character labels, said Silverman, author of ""Good Girls Don't Get Fat."" Kozerski had the classic grass-is-greener mentality that everything would be fine after she lost weight. ""It's not related to a number or a size, or where you shop -- I thought it was about that,"" she said. ""I've realized it's about who you are. If you're confident and healthy, that's where you want to be and that's where you need to be as a person."" She lost 160 pounds -- essentially the weight of another person. She has maintained her weight for a year. It doesn't take an army of nutritionists, personal trainers or experts to get healthier, Kozerski said. ""I'm just a 27-year-old, Midwestern wife and fulltime college student. By definition, I am the 'Average Jane,' I just realized that I was unhappy about myself and about my health and made simple changes to my lifestyle by eating better and moving more. ""Before I was horrified of imperfections, now I see the imperfections as battle scars. I'm proud of what I've gone through and what I've done now.""","Julia Kozerski, 27, has been overweight throughout her life .

"(CNN) -- India's most famous sportsman Sachin Tendulkar will retire from cricket after playing his 200th Test match, he announced Thursday. It will bring down the curtain on a glittering career which has seen him score a record 100 centuries in Tests and one day internationals since making his debut for India in 1989. ""It's been a huge honor to have represented my country and played all over the world. I look forward to playing my 200th Test Match on home soil, as I call it a day,"" the 40-year-old said in a statement. Tendulkar, who has played in a record 198 Test matches, can reach the 200 mark in a two-match series against the West Indies next month. ""All my life, I have had a dream of playing cricket for India. I have been living this dream every day for the last 24 years. ""It's hard for me to imagine a life without playing cricket because it's all I have ever done since I was 11 years old,"" he added. The President of the Indian Cricket Board of Control, N Srinivasan, paid tribute to Tendulkar's record breaking feats. ""He is without doubt the greatest cricketer India has produced,"" he said. ""He has been an inspiration for generations of sportsmen not just cricketers. We respect his decision to retire although many of us can't imagine an Indian team without Sachin."" Tendulkar, a right handed batsman, will go down in history for his incredible run scoring feats, including a record 15,837 runs to date in Test matches, over 2,000 more than his closest rival, former Australian captain Ricky Ponting. In one-day internationals, Tendulkar amassed 18,426 runs, nearly 5,000 runs clear of Ponting's second best tally. Tendulkar retired from one day internationals in December 2012 and an earlier announcement that this season would be his last in the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL), a Twenty20 competition, paved the way for his decision Thursday to retire from all forms of the game. Fittingly, Tendulkar helped the Mumbai Indians franchise win this year's IPL title and also played a key role as India won cricket's World Cup on home soil in 2011. He captained his country 98 times in Tests and one day internationals and aside from his batting feats also claimed 45 Test wickets and 154 victims in one day internationals as a bowler. Tributes to him quickly flowed on social media, with England batsman Kevin Pietersen tweeting: Sachin #10dulkar - Undisputed Champion of Cricket! #SachinTheGreat. Former Australian star Dean Jones made the following prediction: What odds for Sachin to score a Test ton in his last Test? #goodchance. If Tendulkar achieved that feat it would be his 52nd in Tests and all of India will be hoping he can reach the magic three figures just one final time in his farewell matches.","Sachin Tendulkar announces retirement from cricket .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- To anyone shopping at Nairobi's Westgate Mall, it would likely have seemed just another store. But according to a Kenyan intelligence official, the small shop concealed an ominous secret. It was rented by the Al-Shabaab terrorists, or their associates, who within a year would carry out an attack on the upscale shopping mall. The information -- revealed Friday to CNN by the source, who is close to the investigation into the attack -- suggests the Somalian terror organization had been planning the operation at least that long. How the team of terrorists got their weapons and explosives into the mall without notice is a central part of the investigation into the attack, which left at least 67 people dead and parts of the upscale mall in ruins. The Kenya Red Cross said Friday that 61 people remain unaccounted for. Some could be buried in the rubble of the partially collapsed mall. At least five of the terrorists also died before Kenyan forces were finally able to bring the siege to an end on Tuesday. The terrorists stormed the building Saturday. On a Twitter account believed to be run by Al-Shabaab, the group promised more attacks to come. ""The mesmeric performance by the #Westgate Warriors was undoubtedly gripping, but despair not folks, that was just the premiere of Act 1,"" according to a tweet posted Thursday. CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the tweet, but CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said the account, which has also posted links to statements from Shabaab leader Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, appears to be legitimate, even if not ""100% authenticated."" Several Twitter accounts attributed to Al-Shabaab have been shut down in recent days, likely for violating the company's rules against promoting violence in tweets. While Kenyan Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku said Friday that eight suspects are being held for questioning in the attack, authorities are increasingly concerned that some of the attackers managed to escape alongside fleeing civilians in the aftermath of the initial attack, U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN. On Thursday, a Kenyan counterterrorism source told CNN that one of the suspects is an injured Kenyan who was being evacuated when a machine gun magazine fell out of his pocket, leading to suspicion he was among the automatic-weapon toting terrorists who roamed the mall killing civilians. He is being held in a military hospital, the source said. Among the suspects are three people picked up near the Ugandan border, the Kenyan official who revealed information about the mall store told CNN. CNN's Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta; Nima Elbagir reported from Nairobi; CNN's Neda Fashbaf also contributed to this report .","NEW: Possible Al-Shabaab Twitter account warns Nairobi the attack was only ""Act 1""

I know eco-sensitive burial methods are increasingly popular with humans, but I wasn't sure about pets, so I checked it out. Ecologically sensitive burial methods have risen in popularity as of late, thanks much in part to the shaky economic climate. For budget-conscious families and green-minded mourners alike, cremation has emerged as an especially attractive alternative to old-fashioned burials that cost an arm and leg and are extremely resource intensive -- those resources being toxic embalming chemicals like formaldehyde, and concrete, steel and timber. Then, of course, there's the land itself and the copious amount of water and landscaping chemicals needed to keep the carefully manicured plot where your great Aunt Enid is interred looking its best. Although cremation, in the end, is greener than traditional $4,000 metal casket-in-the-ground burials, it isn't without environmental minuses, specifically in terms of energy use and emissions. When it comes to sending a pet off into the great beyond, the options -- and their eco-drawbacks -- are similar: burial in a pet cemetery -- or zoological necropolis, if you will -- or more commonly, cremation. There's also the bury-in-the-yard option, although you may want to check in with any local ordinances that may prohibit this if you plan on interring anything larger than a hamster, canary or goldfish. MNN: Former Marine wins fight to adopt retired bomb-sniffing dog . If you go this route, you should also probably not plan on moving anytime in the near future. And then there's freeze-dried taxidermy for those who really can't stand the thought of parting with their furry companion. There is a natural pet burial movement, although it's a relatively small one. Founded in 2010 by Eric Greene, the Green Pet-Burial Society is a nonprofit organization that offers ""support for a gentle return"" and seems to be the go-to resource for those curious about pet burials where eco-friendly/biodegradable containers, shrouds and unadorned pine boxes placed in natural settings are favored over plastic boxes and immaculately landscaped pet cemeteries. The Green Pet-Burial Society works in cooperation with the Green Burial Council in certifying eco-friendly pet cemeteries and maintains a list of participating providers including green cemeteries like Dust to Dust in Swansea, South Carolina., and the Glendale Memorial Nature Preserve in Glendale, Florida., that allow pet remains to be buried in family plots. Some pet cemeteries, such as Pennsylvania's Keystone Pet Cemetery, offer ""Bio Cremation,"" a process that uses alkaline hydrolysis instead of fire and boasts a dramatically reduced carbon footprint: It cuts natural gas usage by 90%, electricity usage by 66%, and CO2 emissions by 90%. So there you have it -- the small but growing green pet burial movement. Not to be a Donald Downer, but if you have the chance, I'd also check out this story about pet estate planning (yes, estate planning ... there's quite a few wealthy animal heirs out there) and grieving.

"(CNN) -- It might have felt as if the lights had been turned off but Tiger Woods still has a flicker of hope at the Turkish Open. Woods was forced to abandon his efforts on the opening day of the inaugural $7 million tournament as thunderstorms brought a halt to proceedings on a gray and gloomy day on the on the Mediterranean coast of Antalya. The World No.1 managed to complete 10 holes before play was stopped at 16.42pm local time with Woods six shots off the leaders. ""I thought when we teed off we would be lucky to get in 11 holes and I was pretty spot on,"" 14-time major winner Woods told reporters. ""So we got in about the right number of holes as it just gets dark so quickly and it's like someone just turned off the light switch. ""The air now also is heavy with moisture so the ball is not going very far compared to when we were warming up on the range and early in the round. ""But towards the end we were hitting about a half-a-club short. ""I'm still working on getting a bit of the rust out of my game but then tomorrow is going to be a long day for all of us."" Heavy thunderstorms around Belek meant that play did not get under way until 12.05 local time -- allowing only 15 players out of the 78-strong field to complete their rounds. Woods will resume Friday with six shots separating him from English duo Paul Casey and Steve Webster who sit on seven under part alongside South Africa's Darren Fichardt. ""It was a very aggressive start,"" world number 97 Casey told reporters. ""There are opportunities out there with two very reachable par-fives in the first four holes. ""I knocked a driver and three-wood on the green at the first and holed for an eagle. It was foot flat to the floor today and just fire at the pins, take advantage of the soft conditions and see what happens."" ""The field is exceptionally strong and with the layout of the golf course, and the way it is set up, I fully expect somebody is going to get to maybe 20 plus under par this week."" The course, which has been designed by Colin Montgomerie, appeared to suit Casey's game. That should be of little surprise however, given Casey's past successes on courses set out by the Scot. The Englishman's past two European Tour victories at the 2011 Volvo Golf Champions and this year's Irish Open have both come on Montgomerie's courses. ""I seem to play very well around Monty's golf courses,"" he added. ""I won in Bahrain a couple of years ago and then Carton House this year. I do enjoy his golf courses. I have no idea why, but maybe the fact that you can be incredibly aggressive does bode well for me."" ThorbjÃ¸rn Olesen and Ricardo Gonzalez both finished on six-under after recording rounds of 66, while Sweden's money-list leader Henrik Stenson was forced to stop after reaching four-under through 10.","Thunderstorms halt play on opening day of Turkish Open .

"(CNN) -- A rebel group that fought the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo for nearly two years announced Tuesday it would disarm. In a statement on the Facebook page for M23, leader Bertrand Bisimwa said the group would immediately end its rebellion and ""pursue, by purely political means, a search for solutions to the profound issues that led to its creation."" The move came a day after the group and the Congolese government agreed to a ceasefire, during talks in South Africa. Previous talks took place in Uganda. ""To this effect, the major general and all unit commanders of the of the Congolese Revolutionary Army are asked to prepare the troops for the disarmament process,"" Bisimwa's statement added. ""This is a hopeful first step toward peace and prosperity in this region,"" said Russ Feingold, the U.S. special envoy to the Congo and the Great Lakes region. He predicted that the agreements could be signed ""in the next few days."" But, he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour from Johannesburg, South Africa, ""no one should mistake this as the final solution to this problem."" He noted that dozens of armed groups fighting over complex issues have killed more than 5 million people in the past two decades in the region. ""We need a broader political dialogue to solve that,"" he said. Feingold urged that amnesty not be granted to those who committed war crimes or crimes against humanity, but said he hoped that the ""vast majority"" of M23 members would be able to reintegrate into Congolese life. The Congolese government called the move a ""step in the right direction"" which came after rebel forces were defeated in their last strongholds by Congolese army and security forces. A government spokesman said the rebel group and government officials would eventually sign an 11-point declaration, according to a statement on the website of the state-run Congolese Press Agency. However, the spokesman said, the declaration would only be signed after the government could be certain that M23 members were taking the ceasefire and disarmament plan seriously. The announcement by M23's leader came as a spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement Tuesday that 10,000 people had fled in recent days across DRC's eastern border at Bunagana into southwest Uganda's Kisoro district, a direct result of fighting between M23 and government troops. On Monday, the U.N. group transported 3,624 refugees from the border to the Nyakabande transit center, which is located 23 kilometers away. They represent the largest number in a day since the fighting between the government and M23 began in April 2012, the statement said. Other refugees were walking to the center, where 8,230 people were staying on Tuesday. The center has a capacity of 10,000, it added. ""Many of the new arrivals are suffering from dehydration and diarrhea,"" it said. More than half of the new arrivals were young children, many of whom had been separated from their parents while running from the border, it said. In late October, a U.N. peacekeeper was killed during fighting between Congolese forces and M23 rebels, according to a United Nations statement. The Tanzanian peacekeeper was part the U.N. Organization Stabilization Mission in the eastern part of the vast Central African nation. The mission was joining the Congolese military in an effort to protect civilians about 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Goma, the largest city in the region, the statement said. Rebels briefly held Goma a year ago. The eastern part of the DRC is a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of a bloody political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda. Clashes in the region over the past year between the M23 rebel group and Congolese government troops have displaced more than 100,000 people, according to the U.N. M23 is named for a March 23, 2009, agreement it accuses the government of having violated. The soldiers, mostly from the Tutsi ethnic group, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army last year, complaining of lack of pay, poor conditions and failure to receive promised promotions.","NEW: More than 8,000 refugees fled to Uganda in recent days, UNHCR says .

"(CNN) -- Argentine singer Mercedes Sosa, known as ""the voice of Latin America"" for her songs about the plight of the poor, died Sunday, according to an announcement on her Web site. She was 74. Argentine singer Mercedes Sosa died at a Buenos Aires clinic and had reportedly suffered from several ailments. ""On this day, in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, we must inform you that Mrs. Mercedes Sosa, one of the greatest artists of Latin American popular music, has left us,"" the Web site said. Sosa died at a Buenos Aires clinic, and had suffered from liver, kidney and heart ailments, the Washington Post reported. Born on July 9, 1935, in San Miguel de Tucuman, Argentina, Sosa produced 40 albums during her musical career, and performed at places such as the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican and New York's Carnegie Hall. She also served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador for Latin America. ""Her voice always carried a profound message of social engagement through folk-roots music, without prejudice,"" according to the Web site. She formed part of the New Song movement in Latin America, which combined folk song traditions with contemporary music that often featured political messages in its lyrics. When a military junta took over Argentina in 1976, many of her albums were banned, and Sosa left in exile to Paris, France, and Madrid, Spain. She returned to her homeland in 1982. Sosa won various Latin Grammy awards. Her most recent nomination came last year for her latest album, ""Cantora 1."" She was known throughout Latin America and Europe, with one of her most popular songs titled ""Gracias a la Vida,"" the Web site said. ""Her undeniable talent, her honesty and her deep convictions left a tremendous legacy for future generations. Admired and respected throughout the world, Mercedes is recognized as a symbol of our cultural heritage that will represent us forever,"" the Web site said. ""She lived her 74 years to the fullest,"" Sosa's son, Fabian Matus, said. ""She had done practically everything she wanted, she didn't have any type of barrier or any type of fear that limited her."" A viewing was to be held Sunday afternoon at the Salon de los Pasos Perdidos in the Congress of the Nation in Buenos Aires, according to Sosa's Web site.

"(CNN) -- As the United States prepares to build its first new nuclear power reactors in three decades, concerns about an early generation of plants have resurfaced since last year's disaster in Japan. The Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant -- the subject of a battle between state authorities and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission over its continued operation -- uses one of 23 U.S. reactors built with a General Electric-designed containment housing known as the Mark I. It's the same design that was used at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, where three reactors melted down after the station was struck by the tsunami that followed Japan's historic earthquake in March 2011. The disaster resulted in the widespread release of radioactive contamination that forced more than 100,000 people from their homes. GE says the Mark I design has operated safely for more than 40 years and has been modified periodically to meet changing regulations. No nuclear plant could have avoided a meltdown after being swamped by a tsunami and losing power to cooling systems for an extended period of time, the company says -- and at least one expert CNN spoke to agrees. But concerns about the Mark I's ability to contain the consequences of a severe accident have been raised for decades, and critics say the Fukushima Daiichi accident shows it can't survive a real-world disaster. The structure was designed so steam that builds up in an overheating reactor can be diverted into a doughnut-shaped water tank known as the suppression pool, or torus, where it condenses back to water to reduce pressure inside the reactor containment building. That allows utilities to build a much smaller containment structure -- as little as one-sixth the size of those used at some U.S. plants. Stephen Hanauer, a former top safety official at what was then the Atomic Energy Commission, warned in 1971 that in an accident in which the core slowly loses coolant and overheats, the Mark I containment ""would overpressurize. That could lose the torus water source, hence ECCS [emergency core cooling system] as well as leak out fission products."" Read the 1971 Atomic Energy Commission document (PDF) In 1978, the NRC, which replaced the AEC, decided that the design was safe. Hanauer agreed with that decision, which GE and plant operators have pointed out. But the following year, there was a partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. Three Mile Island used an entirely different design, but the NRC began an extensive safety review after the accident that resulted in several changes to the Mark I. One of those was a 1989 push for utilities to install a vent system that would release steam from the containment during an emergency. But as critics point out, that also raises the odds that radioactive material will escape the containment -- even with a ""hardened"" vent, one that tries to filter out the reactor byproducts. Read the 1989 NRC recommendation for U.S. nuclear plants to install vents (PDF) ""A hardened vent is just a way of saying we're going to uncontain the containment,"" said Ken Bergeron, a former physicist at the Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico, who took part in the NRC review. ""The question comes up now -- and this is a really important question -- can the Mark I containment be made better?"" Arnie Gundersen, a former nuclear engineer and a leading critic of the Vermont Yankee plant, says the Japanese accident shows the Mark I containment system can't prevent a release of radioactivity in a meltdown. Watch an excerpt from CNN's Special Investigations Unit report on Vermont Yankee . In an October hearing before the NRC's Petition Review Board, he said the vents were a ""Band-Aid fix"" for the design that failed ""not once, not twice, but three times"" at Fukushima Daiichi. ""True wisdom means knowing when to modify something and knowing when to stop,"" said Gundersen, who leads a state commission set up to monitor the Vermont Yankee plant. Half of U.S. reactors are more than 30 years old . The NRC has rejected a petition by anti-nuclear groups to immediately shut down all reactors using the GE Mark I containment. But it said it would examine several of the issues the petitioners raised as part of its review of the Japanese disaster. Bergeron called the Mark I containment the smallest and weakest of those used in American plants. But he said the NRC ""punted"" in the face of industry resistance by calling only for utilities to install vents. As for GE, he said, ""They got the rule book from the federal government, and they said 'This is all you have to design it for.' The real question is: What should have been done after 1979, when you found out the rule book was flawed?"" GE says it has made several changes to the Mark I design since 1980 aimed at improving safety in the event of an accident. The manufacturer, which has a partnership with Japanese industrial giant Hitachi, stands by its product and says the tsunami that struck Fukushima Daiichi would have devastated any plant. ""There is no nuclear plant operating today that would have performed differently,"" GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy spokesman Michael Tetuan told CNN. Bergeron agrees that no power station could have survived the long-term loss of power that occurred at the Japanese plant without a meltdown. But he noted that at Three Mile Island, the worst U.S. accident to date, there were ""essentially zero emissions"" from its much larger containment structure. ""From the point of view of public safety, that's a home run,"" he said. Tetuan said the nuclear industry is still studying what happened in Japan, ""and there will undoubtedly be lessons learned that will need to be implemented across the industry and across all types of nuclear plants, including the Mark I."" But he added, ""The GE Mark I containment structure design is a proven, reliable technology. It fulfills all regulatory requirements in one of the most highly regulated industries in the world."" Commission: U.S. nukes are safe, but ... Japan will need decades to clean up after Fukushima Daiichi, the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. About 110,000 people are still displaced from homes, a Japanese government commission reported in December. A 20-kilometer (12-mile) radius around the plant remains off-limits. Workers have peered only briefly into the damaged reactor buildings, and experts say a full damage report may take years. ""We need still a little bit more time to find out what really happened,"" said John Lee, a nuclear engineering professor at the University of Michigan. ""It took three years at Three Mile Island to be able to open up the pressure vessel,"" Lee said. ""So we're not quite there yet."" 2011 nuclear power report: No changes needed . Michigan nuclear plant cited for safety violations . The U.S. nuclear industry hasn't built a new reactor since Three Mile Island. But on February 9, the NRC approved two new reactors at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia. The reactors are of a different design than the GE plants at Fukushima Daiichi and in the United States. CNN's Todd Schwarzschild and Curt Merrill contributed to this report.","U.S. OKs new nuclear reactors a year after Japan disaster .

"(CNN) -- Police searching for the suspect in a triple homicide in Georgia have released a 911 call from a man who says he was one of the killer's intended targets. Authorities claim that the suspect, Robert Bell, 33, used an assault weapon similar to an AR-15 to execute two adults and a 12-year-old boy on Sunday, September 15. A fourth shooting victim, Justin Cato, 23, ""laid low"" and then called the police when it was apparent that the gunman had left, said Cpl. Jake Smith of the Gwinnett County Police Department. In a calm voice, Cato tells the dispatcher that a man he did not know came to the house where he lived in Snellville, a city of about 18,000 east of Atlanta. The man didn't say anything and just started shooting, Cato tells the dispatcher. He also says everybody else in the house is shot. Cato was shot in the leg. The deceased victims were each shot multiple times, detectives said. They have been identified as: . -- Angelina Benton, 34, who police say lived at the home and was Cato's girlfriend. -- Benton's godson, Raynord Daniel, 19. -- Benton's 12-year-old son, Joseph McDonald. Bell could be traveling to Chicago or Tennessee, where he has family, said Smith. He is considered armed and dangerous. Benton had invited Bell and his wife to stay with her about two weeks before the shooting, police said. ""They were down on their luck and needed a place to say,"" Smith told CNN. ""About a week later, the suspect's wife moved out to Tennessee for a job, and he stayed there."" On the night of September 15, the victims and Cato were walking to the home when the suspect opened fire with the assault weapon, Smith said. ""We believe he shot and killed the man and the boy before pursuing Angelina down near the end of the driveway."" Bell's SUV was left at the scene along with the weapon. ""He was last seen walking away,"" Smith said. Investigators would not speculate on a possible motive. Bell is wanted on three counts of felony murder and one count of aggravated assault. Anyone with information is asked to call the Gwinnett County Police at 770-513-5300.","Only one person survived a shooting near Atlanta on September 15 .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- First, you may be dazzled by her gentle smile. But then the obvious question comes to mind. Am I sitting across a true leading woman or is her big brother actually calling the shots? At Government House in Thailand, I recently interviewed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra -- a woman who has heard those questions -- and more -- before. She is Thailand's elected leader, the country's first female Prime Minister, and -- as I found out -- ready to fire back at her critics and defend her authority. In 2011, and about ten weeks into her political career, she won a landslide victory to lead a country of 67 million people. Just months into her political career, she was criticized for her handling of Thailand's worst flooding crisis in more than 50 years. Two years on, Yingluck Shinawatra says she has been making decisions based on her own experience and wants to be judged by her achievements. ""You have a lot of key stakeholders,"" Yingluck tells me. ""So you have to make sure the stakeholders are happy."" She has raised the country's minimum wage, helped pass a massive loan bill to overhaul Thailand's transportation infrastructure, and also become the country's first female defense minister -- a position she says she is uniquely qualified to handle because she is a woman. ""Males and females can do this role,"" she says. ""But females will be more concerned about the morale and the support, and building teamwork."" But more recently, protests have erupted in the nation's capital amid opposition to a proposed amnesty bill. As part of a push for unity in the country, the government proposed an amnesty bill which includes a controversial amendment offering a reprieve for any politically-related offenses since January 1 2004. The public dissent -- which has seen thousands march through Bangkok's streets -- stems from the fact that the period specified in the bill includes the time her brother, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was in power, reports the Bangkok Post. It's this family connection where the Thai Prime Minister has been unable to bridge the deep political divide in her country. Yingluck Shinawatra is the youngest sister of the charismatic and deeply polarizing former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra who led the country for five years before the military removed him from power in 2006. Even though Thaksin remains in exile, critics say he is still ruling through his sister. Yingluck concedes she has a close relationship with her brother, but insists she has always been independent, even though her brother at one point called her his ""clone."" ""Clone means the same kind of thinking and management style,"" she says. ""It doesn't mean reliance."" In the last two years, Yingluck has sought to prove herself and her leadership. ""I think there is less criticism about this because if I'm relying on him, I don't think I could be so wise to handle the hard times,"" she tells me. The Thai Prime Minister is under scrutiny not only because of the shadow of her older brother, but for everything from her number of trips abroad to her fashion choices. Recently in Milan, she wore a Thai silk jacket that drew attention since it was stained by the flood waters of 2011. It generated a media debate about whether it was appropriate for Thailand's Prime Minister to be seen wearing it. But Yingluck has also used the media to advance her own platform, including the launch of ""Smart Lady Thailand"" -- a reality TV show out to empower young women. The show prompted a jab from Thai opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva who made reference to a ""Stupid Woman."" While Vejjajiva later said the remark was not directed at a particular person, and not intended as an insult to women, Yingluck supporters called it sexist. Yingluck Shinawatra offered a neutral response: ""I don't want to interpret what he meant, but ... please give a chance for all ladies and Thai people."" Our interview was only the second time CNN sat down with the Thai Prime Minister on camera. My local producer commented to me that Yingluck today, comes across as more media savvy, confident, and serene compared to two years ago when she first came to office. Yingluck may never fully leave the shadow of her brother let alone the scrutiny of her naysayers, but she appears to be a woman trying to make peace with her position. ""People expect you to run the country with sincerity and hard effort to deliver what we promise to the people,"" she says. Cue that dazzling smile.","Yingluck Shinawatra became Thailand's first female PM after a landslide victory in 2011 .

"(CNN) -- Two Virginia day care workers have been fired after photos of children in their care showed up on Instagram -- along with comments making fun of them. ""He is thinking cuz sure can't talk,"" one day care manager from Heavenly Haven Learning Center 2 wrote, according to CNN affiliate WAVY. The 2-year-old child the worker was referring to has delayed speech development, and is pictured sitting in a high chair, looking dejected. Melissa Jordan says the photo shows her son, Ethan. Speaking Tuesday to CNN's ""New Day,"" she had a message for the day care workers: ""If you don't genuinely love and care for children, and if it's not a passion of yours, this isn't something that you should be involved in. If you think it's funny that a child is delayed or if they're not perfect or they have shortcomings, if that's a joke to you or something that you think you should tease about, that's not a job for you."" ""That's how bullying starts. That's how children become bullies"" and insecure, she added. The photo was posted by @mz_oneofakind -- later identified as Jena Ferrel, who worked at the center, WAVY reported. Ferrel would not speak to the station on camera. ""I'm sick of this s***!!!"" she wrote in a caption. Ethan wasn't the only child publicized. The user @mz_oneofakind also posted a photo of a boy whose protruding front teeth she compared to those of Mater from the movie ""Cars."" The @mz_oneofakind account has been taken down.

The Virginia Department of Social Services is investigating the incident. Asked how she would feel if the workers involved said it was a misunderstanding and that they were just trying to be funny, Jordan told CNN, ""maybe I would be a little bit more understanding, like OK, it was an inappropriate joke."" There's no excuse, ""but at least I can understand a human error,"" she said. ""But that hasn't even happened.""

"Broad Channel, New York (CNN) -- Power lines crackled in the solid black night as the Atlantic Ocean rushed ashore. A sandy strip of a neighborhood called Broad Channel was about to go underwater. ""We're gonna drown if this goes any higher!"" Karen Panetta remembers yelling to her four children. Superstorm Sandy hit a year ago this week, shocking this tiny community with its force. On one side of Broad Channel, the ocean poured through homes and met Jamaica Bay on the other side. The Panettas' home was right in the middle. But one glimmer of hope emerged from that dark and scary night: A hero was born. ""I jumped into the water and went for help,"" said Ryan Panetta, 13 at the time. He swam like a little fish to the neighbors' homes looking for people. His mother remembers how the little kids were screaming with fear. She pulled them atop a bed but the water was rising too high. Ryan finally found someone on the second floor of a neighbor's house. He swam back with them through the debris, he said, ""not even thinking about what I was doing but just about my family."" Everyone got out alive. They laughed later that he'd made time to pull on his swim trunks. ""It's hard to explain how you feel about your son after that,"" Karen said a year later. ""I'm so proud of him. Even more after what he's endured ever since."" Ryan's exploits have become a footnote to his endurance, a high point at the beginning of his journey from heroism to heartache. In the days after Sandy, he and his family evacuated to temporary housing an hour away in downtown Brooklyn. His storied community was a wreck. Broad Channel has been home to New York's rescue workers -- firefighters, police, military and medical -- for generations; getaway neighborhoods of beach bungalows converted into permanent homes. It sits along the Rockaway Peninsula, which juts into the Atlantic Ocean with majestic views of Manhattan's signature skyline. Dee Dee Ramone, who combed its beaches here as a child, famously sang about ""Rock Rock Rockaway Beach."" The sun is out, I want some . It's not hard, not far to reach . We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach . In the days after Sandy crashed ashore, the sun did seem out of reach. The historic community was awash with water from a bay, an ocean and even a massive sewage treatment plant that overflowed into Ryan's school, Scholars' Academy. It was one of the worst hit among the 1,750 schools so badly damaged by Sandy that the New York City school system -- the nation's largest -- closed for several days for the first time in recent memory. Immediately after the storm, Ryan's house looked fine from the outside, though a boat had floated onto the adjacent lawn. But inside, a lifetime of memories were soaked with saltwater, the foundation was soggy and the walls were quickly crawling with mold. A family home rebuilt, then destroyed . Despite the damage, it was the Panetta family's lifelong home, so they began rebuilding at once. The family moved to a temporary apartment in Brooklyn where Ryan and his two brothers and sister would rise before dawn for a trip to the closest school bus stop, where private bus companies had been enlisted to fill in for the 300 lost in the storm. A half-hour later, the children were sitting in workrooms and auditoriums and even hallways, crammed into every available space in already crowded schools around the city that had welcomed 73,000 displaced kids. When school wrapped at 3 p.m., they would make an hourlong commute to their wounded home, pulling out dirty wet clothes, useless appliances and furniture, and photo memories that would never be recovered. The Panetta family wasn't alone: More than half the Scholars' Academy students had also lost homes, even the principal and many of the teachers. ""It was heartbreaking to watch that kid and so many others,"" said Principal Brian O'Connell, who also lost his home. ""But they remained so resilient."" 7 years to build Scholars' Academy, 15 minutes to destroy it . ""It's just too much,"" Ryan said one day, breaking into tears at his desk in the temporary school. The teachers did their best to not miss a beat, but scattered friends and families, lost notebooks and lost books crippled the learning process for Ryan. He feared he might not keep up. Then 2013 rolled around and Ryan had ""the best day ever"" when the Scholar's Academy reopened, with students wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the words, ""Rockaway Resilient."" With the ups came the downs. Six months after Ryan and his family started banging away at new wall supports and installing drywall in their wounded home, the city condemned the house and the menacing claws of a giant excavator chewed Ryan's birthplace to pieces. ""I would want to be here to see it but I didn't know it was going to be so tough,"" said Ryan, as machinery put an end to efforts to save their family home. Sandy bringing down homes, families vow to be back . As the family began the process of building a new home on their now vacant lot, the obstacles they faced were substantial. ""The city required us to have two trees in place for a year before we could start unless we got an exemption. The new flood maps require us to build 10 feet over the sidewalk with at least a 5 foot foundation with flood vents,"" Karen Panetta said. New flood maps issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency aimed to prepare for another big storm by stepping up building requirements in areas likely to flood. New homes had to be built higher and stronger and the Panetta family was among those who didn't know where they would get the money. The Panettas were among the New Yorkers who applied for assistance from the federal ""Build it Back"" program. The federal government had allocated $648 million to the city for housing, but almost none of the money has reached the 24,000 people who registered for the program. This week, the federal government allocated another $650 million to the program and announced the first recipient. ""They are taking such a long time and we are $100,000 short of money to rebuild,"" said Karen Panetta, her voice cracking with frustration. ""We're going to put up whatever we can put up, rebuild whatever we can, grab money paycheck to paycheck,"" she said. ""We can't wait. We want to come home."" A new beginning . Plan A for the Panettas is to buy an inexpensive modular home, which comes without a kitchen, flooring or appliances. ""That is what we opted for since we would run out of money and we wanted to at least get a home rebuilt,"" Karen Panetta explained. ""It is those things along with front steps and back steps that we will have to still work on, along with the plumbing and electrical hookups."" She said the family has spent additional funds to meet the new building codes, including having a fire sprinkler system inside the house and other pricey extras that they did not expect when they filed with their insurance after the storm. ""The house has to be Energy Star rated, which was an increase in the cost to rebuild as well -- all things not taken into consideration when the insurance company is paying out,"" she said. They hit another hurdle this week, when the city rejected their architect's plans. The family believes a few revisions will get them approval. They are living in rented housing paid for by an assistance program. Karen Panetta said she avoids visiting the spot where they used to live, an empty lot punctuated by a single mailbox.  The children have only gone back once in many months, to pose for a picture for this article. ""All that we can hope for is that a storm like this never comes this way again,"" she said. ""The only thing I'm sure of is that me and the kids will never, never, ever be in this home again when a storm is on the way."" Ryan, now 14, expresses his frustration to his family daily, even as he brings home high grades and a perfect attendance record. He set up his own paper route and signed up 38 customers, insistent that he would help his family with money. ""He wants his home back just like we all do,"" Karen Panetta said. ""I truly thought things would move quicker. There are days when we are just angry at the whole system and think something has just failed us."" Then, just as she and her husband and children begin to fall into a state of dark despair, their glimmer of hope shines again. Ryan was recently awarded a medal of honor from the Boy Scouts of America, something given rarely. It was to applaud him for risking his life to save others. They posted a video on YouTube about his exploits. ""The motto is 'Be prepared,'"" said Ryan. ""Which really helps, because you never know what life is going to throw at you."" Or what one teenage boy will throw back.","Ryan Panetta, now 14, helped save his family when Superstorm Sandy hit last year .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Tom Cruise is defending his relationship with daughter Suri, denying that she felt ""abandoned"" last summer when he was divorcing her mother, actress Katie Holmes. Cruise's sworn affidavit was filed in federal court Tuesday as part of the actor's defamation lawsuit against a tabloid publisher; it was made public Wednesday. ""The assertion that I 'abandoned' Suri after my divorce is patently false,"" Cruise said. ""I have in no way cut Suri out of my life -- whether physically, emotionally, financially or otherwise."" His lawyers are trying to force Bauer Publishing Group to disclose any sources that support the headlines and stories published by the company's Life & Style and InTouch magazines. Tabloid lawyers: Headlines are 'true or substantially true' The publisher said in a statement Thursday that both magazines ""stand behind the reporting and articles at issue in Mr. Cruise's action."" ""This litigation has established that the editorial teams had a wealth of evidence substantiating that following his divorce from Ms. Holmes, Mr. Cruise was absent from his daughter for long periods of time, that seeing her was not his first priority and that she was emotionally struggling as a result of her father's extended absences,"" Bauer Publishing said.Â  ""Mr. Cruise does not challenge the accuracy of any of the underlying facts that informed the opinions expressed by the editorial teams at In Touch and Life & Style.""Â . The tabloids' lawyers argued in a response filed in court in December that Cruise can't win ""because he is a public figure and the Bauer defendants did not act with actual malice."" ""The articles reported on an issue of legitimate public interest,"" the publisher said in Thursday's statement. ""Mr. Cruise has repeatedly promoted himself as being a devoted father who made his family his top priority. Now, with his own admissions, it is clear that the picture he strives to paint is not accurate. It is entirely in keeping with responsible reporting to question Mr. Cruise's self-promotion and to inform the public about the truth."" The publisher's court filing said that Cruise ""did not dispute that he had not visited Suri for over two months, despite previously assuring his daughter that he would be spending a lot of time with her after his divorce."" The July 18, 2012, Life & Style cover carried the headline ""SURI IN TEARS, ABANDONED BY HER DAD"" along with a photo of the child. There was no accompanying story to support or explain the headline. A story inside the July 30, 2012, Life & Style read ""Suri's emotional troubles,"" under a photograph of Suri appearing to have tears in her eyes while in her mother's arms, the suit said. The story reveals that it was ""as a result of Suri being upset over not being able to take a puppy home from a pet store."" The complaint also points to an InTouch cover story from September 2012 headlined ""44 DAYS WITHOUT TOM ... ABANDONED BY DADDY ... Suri is left heartbroken as Tom suddenly shuts her out and even misses her first day of school... HAS HE CHOSEN SCIENTOLOGY OVER SURI FOR GOOD?"" Photos: Celeb custody battles . Cruise: Suri and I are 'extremely close' Cruise said his daughter often traveled with him when he traveled around the world to make movies, which ""allowed me to see my daughter while still fulfilling my obligations to my work, my colleagues, and the studios that hire me."" Suri, now 7, stayed with Holmes and attended school in New York while Cruise worked on two back-to-back film projects in Iceland and the United Kingdom from June to December last year, he said. ""As a result of the changed circumstances following the divorce, we were not able to see each other as often as we did prior to the divorce."" Still, Cruise said, he was able to see his daughter several times during that period. ""But even during the times when I was working overseas and was not able to see Suri in person, we were (and continue to be) extremely close,"" he said. ""We spoke on the phone nearly every day, and I regularly asked for and received updates concerning her friends and school life, which I then discussed with her during our regular phone calls."" E-mails with Holmes prove that he ""was a constant presence in Suri's life during the time that defendants claim falsely that I abandoned her,"" he said. The tabloid headlines suggesting that Suri was ""feeling abandoned"" by him are ""patently false,"" he said. ""While I'm sure my daughter misses me when I am not with her (as I miss her), she is a very happy child, and we have a wonderful relationship and cheerful phone calls,"" he said. ""She has never indicated, in words or substance, that she has ever felt abandoned by me."" A hearing in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles is set for November 26 for arguments about the tabloids' sources for the stories. Cruise's lawsuit is asking for $50 million in damages from the publisher. Halle Berry makes 'amicable' deal with child's dad . Cruise lawyer: 'Serial defamers' sell 'malicious garbage' Cruise lawyer Bert Fields sent two letters informing the publisher that the headlines were false and demanding retractions, but he was refused in each case, the lawsuit said. ""These serial defamers are foreign-owned companies with their global headquarters in Hamburg (Germany),"" Fields said in October 2012, when he filed the lawsuit. ""They take money from unsuspecting Americans by selling their malicious garbage. Having to pay a libel judgment may slow them down."" Since the magazines are displayed at supermarket checkout lines, ""millions of people each day must see their covers which feature screaming headlines in huge, brightly colored letters that are typically of a false, lurid and titillating nature, and that are often entirely unsupported by the stories buried in the magazines' interiors,"" the suit said. ""Tom doesn't go around suing people,"" Fields said. ""He's not a litigious guy. But when these sleaze peddlers try to make money with disgusting lies about his relationship with his child, you bet he's going to sue."" Cruise will ""undoubtedly"" donate any judgment proceeds to charity, Fields said. ""He always has.""","NEW: Tabloids ""stand behind the reporting and articles at issue in Mr. Cruise's action""

"(CNN) -- Shortly after Alabama's rout of Notre Dame there was one word that many on the field seemed not to want to broach. Dynasty. But why not? Alabama's 42 to 14 thrashing of Notre Dame in Monday night's BCS National Championship game was the Crimson Tide's second in a row. It is also Alabama's third national title in the last four years. Isn't this a dynasty, a reporter asked Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron, moments after he led his team to the win? ""You can call us whatever you want but this was a total team effort,"" McCarron said. Alabama coach Nick Saban also shied away from the D- word during a news conference after the game. ""I don't think words like dynasty are words that I have much interest in. That is for other people to speak about,"" Saban said. And many on social media were. ""I really believe that this is, in my lifetime, the best dynasty that I've ever seen in college football,"" ESPN personality Kirk Herbstreit tweeted about Alabama. Herbstreit's comment was retweeted thousands of times. In fact, ""#Dynasty"" was trending in many regions in the United States early Tuesday morning as Crimson Tide fans partied in the streets of Tuscaloosa. With the win, Alabama joins college football royalty. The team joins Nebraska, in the '90s, and Notre Dame, in the '40s, as the only teams to win three championships in four years. When Nebraska did it, they shared the 1997 championship with Michigan. And to add to Alabama's legacy, none of the championship games were really close. In 2010, Alabama stomped Texas 37 to 21. Last year, the Tide blanked LSU 21 to 0. And this year, the championship game felt like it was over at halftime. Game? What game? There's a pretty woman in the stands! The No. 2 Crimson Tide scored on drives of 82, 61 and 80 yards against the top-ranked and undefeated Irish in its first three drives of the game. They drove 71-yards and scored with 31 seconds left in the half to take a dominating 28-0 lead. By that time, despite the fact that half of the game was yet to be played, many of those commenting on Twitter were jokingly wondering if Notre Dame would come out of the locker room for the second half. The Irish did, but it did not get much better for them. In fact, one of the biggest hits of the game on Alabama's quarterback McCarron came from his own teammate, Barrett Jones. The two teammates disagreed on a play call and had to call a timeout to get it cleared up. McCarron got in his lineman's face and Jones pushed him some three yards back, a feat that Notre Dame could never do throughout the game. Notre Dame also couldn't stop Alabama's running game. Crimson Tide runners Eddie Lacy and T.J. Yeldon both ran for more than 100 yards. Notre Dame Fighting Irish head coach Brian Kelly said his team had a lot to learn from Alabama. ""We are not there yet,"" Kelly said. ""Alabama showed us that in the way they played the game. We got a lot of work left to do to get back here."" But there was one player from Alabama who was ready to put the crown on. ""I think I can use the word dynasty now,"" said linebacker Nico Johnson, shortly after the confetti fell on the field. ""Three titles in four years, that is a dynasty."" Bleacher Report coverage of the national title game . CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Alabama wins its third BCS title in four years .

"(CNN) -- The family of a woman killed during a shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard filed a federal claim Friday against the government, alleging the Department of the Navy and the Department of Veterans Affairs ignored numerous warnings about the gunman's unstable mental state. Attorneys are seeking $37.5 million on behalf of Mary DeLorenzo Knight's estate and her two daughters, according to a copy of the administrative claim provided to CNN. Knight, 51, was one of 12 people killed on September 16 when authorities say Aaron Alexis opened fire at the Navy Yard. Alexis was killed by police. The FBI has said Alexis, a contractor who had been discharged from the Navy, was under ""the delusional belief that he was being controlled or influence by extremely low frequency electromagnetic waves"" in the days leading up to the shooting. The Knight claim alleges the Navy and the VA missed a numerous ""red flags"" that Alexis presented a foreseeable risk, citing his run-ins with authorities where his mental health was called into question. The claim alleges the Navy should have known that Alexis exhibited a pattern of ""emotionally unstable behavior,"" citing his general discharge in 2011 for misconduct. It also cited three arrests, dating back to 2004 when he was arrested in Seattle, accused of shooting out the tires of a man's truck in an anger-fueled ""blackout."" His father told Seattle police in 2004 that his son was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after taking part in 9/11 rescue efforts, according to police records. The claim accuses the VA of failing to diagnose and hospitalize Alexis, who ""sought assistance for mental illness"" at a VA hospital on August 23. It alleges Alexis reported symptoms of paranoia to the VA hospital. The VA declined to comment on the claim, referring questions to the Justice Department. ""We are working closely with the Department of Justice to address this claim. But as an ongoing action, it would be inappropriate to comment any further,"" said Lt. Robert Myers, a Navy spokesman. Such a claim is a possible precursor to a lawsuit. Under the law, the federal government must determine whether the claim has merit. If the government determines it doesn't, the claimant can then file suit. ""There is generally a six-month waiting period"" with such a claim, said the Knight family attorney Clifford S. Gibbons. ""But we aren't waiting six months. We'll file in about two weeks.""","NEW: Navy says it cannot comment on ""ongoing action""

"(CNN) -- Houston Texans head coach Gary Kubiak is out of the hospital but when he will return to the team is still in question. Kubiak, 52, had a transient ischemic attack -- which the Mayo Clinic says has symptoms similar to a stroke -- during Sunday's game against the Indianapolis Colts. The Texans said in a news release that Kubiak was released Tuesday and is expected to make a full recovery. ""I've been through an ordeal and my focus now is to get back to good health,"" Kubiak said, according to the team statement. The coach was walking near the 20-yard line just after halftime started when he slowly bent over and then collapsed, shocking the crowd and members of Kubiak's own team and staff. In a post-game news conference, defensive coordinator Wade Phillips recalled his confusion in the moments after Kubiak's collapse, describing it as ""a shock to everybody."" ""I was traveling in, and I saw him on the ground, and I kept asking, 'What happened?'"" he said. ""And that's kind of what happened with everybody."" The team said Kubiak ""experienced dizziness and a light-headed feeling."" On the Mayo Clinic website a transient ischemic attack is differentiated from a stroke as it lasts only a few minutes and causes no permanent damage. It is often called a mini-stroke, the website said. The Mayo Clinic did warn that 1 in 3 people who have a TIA eventually do have a stroke. CNN's David Close contributed to this report.","Gary Kubiak, 52, had a transient ischemic attack, sometimes called a mini-stroke .

"(CNN) -- A picture is worth a thousand words -- but for Christie Morgan, those words weren't worth remembering. When she was forced to pose for photos at her niece's Sweet 16 party in 2008, she realized just how overweight she really was. If she didn't make a drastic change, she knew she wouldn't live to see future family milestones. At the time, she weighed in at 403 pounds. Because of her body size, she struggled throughout everyday life. She couldn't walk more than a few steps in her own home, get out of a car or fit in airplane seats. ""I swear, every beat of my heart hurt,"" Morgan says. ""Any moment could be my last, and I felt one morning I simply would not wake up."" Morgan grew up in a large family where every occasion centered around food. Every birthday, anniversary, graduation or accomplishment was an excuse to consume authentic Italian food. She wanted to be a role model for her daughter, Brielle, now 18, but says it was difficult enforcing a healthy diet when she wasn't following one herself. When Brielle had parent-teacher days at school, Morgan refused to attend because she didn't want to embarrass her daughter by being ""the fat mom."" ""When you are that large and that miserable in your body, you feel like you're a failure to your children, your parents and society,"" Morgan says. Doctors told her the only way to lose enough weight to be at a healthy BMI was through gastric bypass surgery. Her friends constantly told her she wouldn't be successful if she didn't get professional help. Morgan says she considered both, but ultimately she wanted to shed the pounds on her own naturally. ""I felt just from watching surgery-goers, their body changed, but they weren't all that healthy,"" Morgan says. ""They could continue to eat the junk, just not as much."" In the past, she had tried almost every single diet fad known. ""Either I failed them, or they failed me, I just don't know,"" Morgan says. So she decided to look at weight loss as a challenge to her doctors and herself, not as punishment. Days after seeing pictures from the birthday party, Morgan sat down and formed an eating plan. She took elements of other diets and her knowledge from nutrition classes she took in college and created her own diet plan. Lean meats and fish, fresh fruits and vegetables, KIND bars and unlimited water are essentials during the day. Morgan says she didn't want to feel deprived as she did in other diets -- she wanted a way to eat cleaner and feel full at the same time. ""I love cooking and entertaining,"" Morgan says. ""I needed to find a way to cook my favorite foods healthier, not cut them out entirely."" She says exercising was a challenge in the beginning, but starting slow allowed her to keep realistic goals. ""The first day of exercising resulted in me breaking a ""Total Gym"" machine because I exceeded the weight limit,"" Morgan says. So she steered clear of the gym to avoid being ridiculed by strangers. ""It's not about investing in supplements, gym memberships, programs or diet plans,"" she says. ""For me it was about investing in myself, my health, my mind and my body."" In two years, Morgan has shed a total of 289 pounds. She now weighs 114 pounds. She says looking back at pictures, she can see the sadness in her eyes. The smile on her face was a facade to hide from how she truly felt about her body. ""Perfection is knowing that I am the best I can be in every way,"" she says. ""And now I'm no longer an observer of life, but a participant."" Have you lost weight?

"Washington (CNN) -- The FBI has launched an investigation into an alleged incident of child sexual abuse at a facility that provides services to children of civilian and military personnel who work at the Army's Fort Meade in Maryland. At present, there is one known allegation concerning the Youth Center, according to Chad Jones, spokesman for the installation that lies between Washington and Baltimore. But officials are sending hundreds of letters to families whose children might have come in contact with an unidentified civilian man who worked at the center from 2005 until his resignation in 2012. They are publicizing the case to see whether others may come forward, Jones said Friday. The man's position was not immediately known, but Jones said ""he worked with kids."" A town hall meeting for families is scheduled for Thursday. Mary Doyle, also with public affairs at Fort Meade, told CNN that the center generally serves children in grades 6-8 through sports programs and non-athletic activities, such as computer labs and arts and crafts. On weekends, younger children occasionally partake in activities. About 20 staff members typically are at the center when activities under way, Doyle said. The Youth Center is not a school. Schools at Fort Meade are operated by Maryland's Anne Arundel County Public Schools. The employee in question had no connection to any of the schools, she said. A 24-hour family hotline has been set up for anyone who has more questions for base officials. The FBI said it would have no comment. Civilian law enforcement alerted Fort Meade to the alleged incident, officials said. George Wright with Army public affairs said the FBI is leading the investigation because the allegation involves a federal facility. ""Fort Meade is fully cooperating with the FBI's investigation and is providing support to families as necessary,"" he said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- ABC is calling on a few heroes. After the monster box office success of ""Marvel's The Avengers"" and other superhero movies in the franchise, the network is hoping some of that same magic can translate to the small screen. ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"" co-created by ""Avengers"" writer/director Joss Whedon -- who also directed the series premiere -- is kicking off a brand new Tuesday night lineup for ABC this fall, a night which used to be anchored by the ""Dancing with the Stars"" results show. Clark Gregg is back as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) Agent Coulson -- one of the main links between the various Marvel movies -- who is tasked with leading a new team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to handle the various strange occurrences that happen once aliens invade and a team of heroes battle them in New York City. (Think ""Men in Black"" or ""The X-Files"" with superheroes.) Of course, Coulson's return comes as something of a surprise because (SPOILER ALERT) he was killed by Loki in ""The Avengers."" The premiere contains an explaination of how Coulson survived -- at least, the explanation as far as Coulson knows. It's just the first of what's sure to be several plot twists to be part of the series, in typical Whedon fashion. While Whedon prepares to direct ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" he brought in some trusted people to run the show day to day. You might just say he trusts them like family: his brother Jed Whedon and sister-in-law Maurissa Tancharoen (""Dollhouse,"" ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog""). Jed Whedon, Tancharoen and, separately, Gregg spoke with CNN on the cusp of the show's premiere. CNN: So how much fun is it to play in the Marvel sandbox? Tancharoen: We've always been fans of the Marvel universe, and we're big fans of the Marvel movies. To be able to play in a universe with such a long history is something we're very excited about doing. Whedon: You have these really human emotions and predicaments amplified by superhero elements, for us it's a perfect fit. CNN: It seems like Coulson is darn near immortal now. How surprising was it to learn of his resurrection? Gregg: He's like a cockroach; you can't kill him off. When it came to do that ""Avengers"" [death] scene, it was an emotional day. I had played this part for four movies, and I loved so much what Joss had written for that. I wasn't sad, but I found I was really emotional about it. At the end they were saying, ""It's a comic book, so [he might come back],"" but I thought, ""Oh they're just being nice. Just trying to smooth my path to the next world."" Soon after I thought,""Well, I guess I need to start dealing with this, don't I?"" Then I get a call from [""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" executive producers] Jeph Loeb and Joss. They say ""OK, you might not be so dead. Here's what we're thinking ..."" It was such a spectacular take on why I might not be dead. And the idea of doing a TV show created by Joss -- who created ""Firefly"" and ""Buffy,"" which I love -- was exciting to me. CNN: How do you best describe the show? Whedon: The show takes place within the Marvel cinematic universe, but it's about being a regular person living in that world. Tancharoen: Our tag line is ""Not all heroes are super."" At its core, it is about being human. That human experience is amplified because these regular people are coming up against extraordinary things. The themes that we've dealt with on other shows like feeling less than, and wanting to be greater. All those things we can explore and dig in even deeper because of what we come up against from week to week. CNN: What special Whedon touches will we see? Whedon: One of the things Joss has always done and we like to do -- and a big part of the Marvel brand -- is humor throughout. We think that one of the reasons the films have been successful is humor brings everyone to the table. We love that and we want our characters to be not just interesting, complicated and screwed up -- but funny. Tancharoen: We think that will marry both audiences. Marvel and ABC have distinctly different audiences and we think we can bring those audiences together with humor. CNN: Did you set out to comment humorously on the action as it happens? Whedon: There's an expectation with it being a spy show -- and there's certain superhero movies that take themselves very seriously -- there's nothing better than being able to subvert that expectation and comment on it. And there's nothing better to do that than with Clark Gregg, whose delivery is perfect and whose sense of humor is dry and calm as ever. Tancharoen: We have a running joke in the room that we will write the worst lines for him, but he'll pull it off and sound as classy and cool as he is. CNN: So do you sit back and say, ""Well, I guess I'm an action star now?"" Gregg: I sit in a hot tub, trying to heal my muscles, saying 'Well I guess I'm an action star now,' with an ice pack next to me. It's really fun. CNN: How do you get along with your team on the show? Gregg: Joss has a knack for finding amazing actors who are also really joyful and fun to work with. So you think, ""Here come these young guys, let's see what they're like,"" and if anything, they couldn't be more down for whatever. They're ready to jump in and see what happens. I couldn't be more impressed with them. I think the audience will flip for them. CNN: What were you looking for in your cast? Whedon: We were looking for ugly faces. Tancharoen: We wanted really ugly people. It wasn't a conscious thing for us to cast all new faces, honestly. We scoured the globe for these people, literally. The people we cast were the ones who nailed it and won the part basically. Whedon: And brought something we were looking for, as well as things we didn't know we were looking for. CNN: The thing people remember from the trailer the most is Coulson's vintage car, Lola. Tancharoen: Lola's gotten so much play! Whedon: Lola travels with the [S.H.I.E.L.D.] plane, so Lola will be in the show. Lola is an old model, so fuel for Lola is very expensive. Gregg: It's not the only thing Coulson has a passion about that is a relic of super-high-tech covert ops. He's a bit of a collector that way. CNN: Agent Maria Hill (""How I Met Your Mother's"" Cobie Smulders) shows up in the pilot. Do you hope to work with other familiar faces from ""The Avengers?"" Gregg: I am hoping to see that. Every time I think ""Boy, as a fan of Marvel, wouldn't it be cool if they exploited the connection between these two things?,"" they've done it. I'd be a little disappointed if some of our friends from the comics and the movies didn't cross-pollinate into the show, and I've got a feeling Marvel's not gonna disappoint the fans in that way. Tancharoen: We are very open to the opportunity to bring in familiar faces, but at the same time we want the show to exist on its own. We are in the same universe as all the movies, so being a part of that universe means bringing in people. If they want to come play with us, our door is wide open. Whedon: Samuel L. Jackson has expressed an interest in doing the show, so at some point, we're gonna call him on it. Tancharoen: And say, ""Hey, do you really wanna do this?"" I think he said he wanted to be like Charlie's voice in ""Charlie's Angels."" CNN: Will there be season-long story arcs as we saw on shows like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" and will they connect to the greater Marvel cinematic universe? Whedon: We're in contact with features at all times, and we think our job is to stay out of their way, between the films, and tee up the things they want us to tee up and deal with the fallout. But in terms of our storytelling, we're gonna have a lot of standalone, episodic stories. Tancharoen: With our mythology woven through. Whedon: We don't want people to have to have seen every episode to be able to understand what's happening, but we also to reward those who do watch. CNN: What can we look forward to as the season plays out? Gregg: There's more to the story of how Agent Coulson lives than even Agent Coulson knows, and you can't walk away from that secret. Tancharoen: It's definitely a question at the heart of the show that we'll play out over time, and we hope the journey to the answer will be as satisfying as the answer. Whedon: We want to earn it and spend our time with it, because we feel like there's a lot of fun to be had there, but we won't go so slowly that people... Tancharoen: ...Pull their hair out and curse our names on the Internet. Whedon: Everyone knows how much time and money goes into a pilot. Tancharoen: If they think the pilot is big... Whedon: They will not be disappointed in the episodes that follow.","Joss Whedon is co-creator of the ""Marvel's Avengers"" a spinoff TV series .

"(CNN) -- Basketball legend Dennis Rodman arrived in Beijing on Saturday from North Korea without imprisoned American Kenneth Bae. Rodman, who visited North Korea this week, was tight-lipped about his trip. ""It is not my job to talk about Kenneth Bae,"" he told reporters gathered at the Beijing airport. Sporting a silver, shiny cap and a long scarf, the 6-foot-7 inch (2.01 meter) former basketball star broke through the crowd and continued talking. ""Ask Obama about that, ask Hillary Clinton about that,"" Rodman said. ""Ask those ---holes."" Other detained Americans . The eccentric Hall of Famer's trip was the second to the hardline Communist state this year to visit North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In March, Rodman was pictured with Kim, an ardent basketball fan, laughing and eating while watching an all-star basketball match. He was criticized over the trip, which came amid escalating tension with North Korea threatening missile strikes on the U.S., South Korea and Japan. Rodman has previously made no secret about his desire to help Bae. He once tweeted that he wanted the 30-year-old unchallenged leader of North Korea to ""do him a solid"" by freeing him. Bae was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in February after he was convicted of unspecified ""hostile acts"" against North Korea. The country's state-run Korean Central News Agency said he was arrested late last year after arriving as a tourist in Rason City, a northeastern port near the Chinese border.

"New York (CNN) -- For the first time since Tyler Clementi's death, the family of the Rutgers University freshman walked across the bridge where he took his own life. Clementi's mother, Jane, and his brother, James, were joined Sunday by anti-bullying supporters as they visited the George Washington Bridge, which connects upper Manhattan with Fort Lee, New Jersey. Clementi, 18, committed suicide in 2010 after learning his roommate, Dharun Ravi, had secretly used a webcam to stream his sexual encounter with another man. Ravi was sentenced in May 2012 to serve 30 days in jail and three years of probation, and to complete 300 hours of community service. He was released on June 19 after serving 20 days behind bars. The event Sunday was the culmination of a 37-day, 921-mile walk from Chicago to New York City to promote friendship as a way to reduce bullying. The event was organized by Friend Movement co-founders Ronnie Kroell and Elliot London. Since Tyler's death, the Clementi family has formed The Tyler Clementi Foundation, a nonprofit group dedicated to working with and supporting gay and lesbian youths. Kroell, 30, and London, 32, worked with The Tyler Clementi Foundation on this Friend Movement project but without any intentions of having the Clementis participating, according to London. They were shocked and honored when Jane and James decided to walk with them across bridge, a painful reminder of Tyler's death, London said. ""This is a very strong woman who knows that (Tyler's) life is so important to remember and to help create more awareness,"" London said of Clementi's mother. ""(Jane and James) were incredibly strong."" As they walked over the bridge, Kroell said the sky opened up into warm sunshine and the wind went quiet. They felt Tyler was walking alongside them, he said. After crossing the bridge, Kroell, London and the Clementis met with about 75 other supporters at Fort Tryon Park to tie purple ribbons -- a symbol for anti-gay bullying awareness -- around the trunk and branches of a tree in remembrance of Tyler and other victims of bullying who have committed suicide. Kroell and London had asked participants to wear purple as well. ""The reason why we chose not to stop at the bridge, but to keep walking to the end, was to show the community we can overcome these obstacles,"" Kroell said. Having been victims of bullying themselves, Kroell and London said they co-founded the Friend Movement to promote positive anti-bullying messages through art and media, in the wake of an increasing number of adolescent suicides committed because of bullying. They were inspired by Clementi's death and decided to spend 37 days walking from city to city, having conversations with communities and sharing stories about friendships and bullying, London said. ""Everyone has something that's happened to them,"" London said. ""It's been incredible to be an ear to listen."" Kroell and London began their walk on October 5 from The Bean in Millennium Park in Chicago, and now they will be flying back to their homes in Los Angeles. Kroell said they are returning as two very different people than when they left and hope to stay in touch with everyone they met along the way. ""These are people that have changed our life,"" Kroell said. ""They really touched our lives.""","In 2010, a distraught Tyler Clementi, 18, jumped from the George Washington Bridge .

"Washington (CNN) -- No science or religion can accurately predict what will happen in Congress. But looking plainly at the political chess board and listening to sources on Capitol Hill, there is plenty of reason to think that a shutdown of the federal government won't happen, at least not next week. Here's why: . Politics. And blame. And 1996. ""Let's put it this way,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told CNN. ""I'm not about to shut down the government and have Republicans take the blame for it. It's just that simple."" Bluntly, many Republicans fear they will be blamed for a shutdown, just months before a big congressional election year. This makes them highly motivated to find a way to keep government running. A CNN/ORC poll in mid-September showed 51% of people would hold Republicans in Congress responsible for a shutdown versus 40% for President Barack Obama. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, might already be in this camp. He initially proposed a spending bill that would have avoided a standoff. Conservatives forced him to go to war with a different version fully defunding Obamacare, but Boehner's opening move was an important signal that he wants to sidestep a shutdown. Main Street fed up over Beltway shutdown battle . There may be some learned behavior from history here, too. ""I saw this movie before, I saw what happened before,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, talking about the sting Republicans felt after the shutdowns in 1995 and 1996. ""That's what happened the last time we tried this,"" he concluded. Bottom line: Ideal or not, Congress runs on political currency. And multiple House GOP aides tell CNN that the majority of the Republicans in their conference fear a shutdown would cost them with voters. The next fights . Republicans are divided over how far to take the Obamacare battle right now. And GOP leaders also are preparing a second Obamacare fight during the upcoming debt ceiling debate. So, they have the option of dropping the anti-Obamacare push from the shutdown debate now and instead including it in the debt ceiling fight coming up. At the same time, Democrats are eager to get past the shutdown debate so they can move on to the debt ceiling and start to deal with yet another fight: budget cuts slated to hit in January at the latest. The numbers . Republicans have 233 members in the House, 16 votes more than a majority. Those 233 are divided over how far to take the Obamacare fight, over whether to ultimately shut down government in the name of defunding the health care law. This year, funding measures repeatedly have passed the House of Representatives with a bipartisan coalition. Take a look at the Superstorm Sandy funding vote. Or the last debt ceiling increase. Or the March vote to avoid a government shutdown. Sure, every vote is different. But a bipartisan safety net has magically rolled out during the last funding standoffs. Deadline pressure . Something happens in the day or two before a potential shutdown. Whatever the atmosphere and seemingly-firm positioning now, things will ramp up fast if Congress gets closer to a shutdown, especially a shutdown that would go in place during a work week. Workers ask if they will be sent home without pay. Troops (and their families) worry if their paychecks will be delayed. Families may start to cancel vacations. That is the moment when incredible political pressure against a shutdown builds. The deadline itself . Finally, we come to a public secret. The government does not necessarily have to shut down at the end of the day on September 30. Yes, at midnight, funding officially runs out for most programs. But if lawmakers are close to a deal, the president can order agencies to keep running for a few hours or perhaps even a day or two for Congress to pass the legislation. CNN Fact Checks: Obamacare . This has happened before. Recently. At midnight at the end of April 8, 2011, the funding for most agencies officially ran out. But Democrats and Republicans had struck a funding deal a few hours before, it just had not passed through Congress yet. So the Obama administration told agencies to hold off with any shutdown plans because a spending bill was likely to become law soon. In that case, it waived just a few hours of shutdown, but sources in both parties at the Capitol have confirmed that the president can do this for a longer period if a deal is emerging. Again, Congress works best on deadlines, and the shutdown deadline is not quite as firm as people might think. Why a shutdown (still) might happen . All this said, you cannot underestimate the swirling, unpredictable dynamics in Congress at the moment and Republicans' gut-level objections to Obamacare. Once the Senate passes its version of a spending bill, House Republicans are considering attaching another item to it. That could be a one-year delay in the individual insurance mandate in Obamacare, a repeal of a medical device tax, a change in how the government handles congressional employee health plans or possibly something in support of the Keystone pipeline. How this affects you . A spending bill with something Republicans want and Democrats don't would set up a late game of chicken between the House, Senate and president. If no one blinks, which is possible, this would lead to a shutdown. It's unclear whether House Republicans will do this. It is also unclear how Democrats would react. But this scenario is the reason there is still a chance a shutdown could happen.","The federal government is facing a possible shutdown next week .
The government has been here before in 1995 and 1996 .
History may give Congress pause before embarking on another shutdown ."

"(CNN) -- Earlier this month Apple released its annual supplier responsibility report which detailed alleged workplace health and safety protocol violations by its suppliers. One of its chief suppliers, Foxconn, has been at the center of a storm in recent months after workers at some of its plants in China staged strikes and even threatened mass suicide to win better working conditions. Who is Foxconn? Foxconn is part of Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., one of the world's largest suppliers of components for the electronics industry. Much of its manufacturing division is based in mainland China, where it assembles a range of products including Apple's iPhone and iPad, Amazon's Kindle and Microsoft's Xbox. With 1.2 million employees in China alone, production takes place at more than 12 factories across the country, including the giant Longhua plant in the southern city of Shenzhen -- the company's biggest manufacturing facility, and employer of almost half of its Chinese workforce. Foxconn produces an estimated 40% of the world's consumer electronics. Who does it do business with? Foxconn makes everything from motherboards and gaming consoles to MP3 players and smartphones for some of the world's biggest electronics brands, including Dell, Sony and Hewlett-Packard. However Apple is its prized partnership. The company has seen phenomenal sales growth in mainland China in particular and opened Asia's largest Apple Store in Shanghai in September. The company announced in July that its revenue from the Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, reached $8.8 billion for the first three quarters of the fiscal year, a more than six-fold increase over the same period a year earlier. Last week, analysts at investment bank Morgan Stanley predicted the U.S. tech giant could sell 40 million iPhone handsets in China alone in 2013 when it agrees to deals with more Chinese telecom providers. This compares to the 68.5 million iPhones Apple sold worldwide in 2011. What is it accused of? Though Foxconn has a reputation in the technology field for its efficiency and low overhead, critics say workers are treated like machines for low pay in an oppressive military-style environment -- employees typically eat, sleep and work at the giant complexes. ""They wake up, they have breakfast, they go to work, they work a solid shift, they come back to their dormitories and they sleep ... it's a very dehumanizing place, and the workers are little more than machines there,"" said Geoffrey Crothall of the China Labor Bulletin, a Hong-Kong based non-profit group that tries to protect workers' rights across China. In 2010, Foxconn raised workers' pay twice at its factory in Shenzhen after a spate of suicides, Chinese state media reported at the time. In January, Microsoft issued a statement saying it was investigating a report that workers at a plant that manufactures the Xbox game system had threatened mass suicide in a pay dispute. Foxconn would only say that there was a protest at its Wuhan factory in Hubei province in central China and that it was over. Last year, an explosion at a Foxconn plant that produces Apple's iPad2 killed four people and injured 18 more. Chinese officials said the blast may have been caused by combustible dust in a polishing workshop. The incident, in the southwestern city of Chengdu, followed a report by rights group Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior (SACOM) that workers at the same plant do not have adequate training in the use of chemicals and do not have regular on the job health checks. A number of workers SACOM said it spoke to when compiling the report complained of allergies being ignored by Foxconn, poor ventilation and inadequate personal protective equipment. What has it said? Though Foxconn maintains its workers are treated well, Chairman Terry Gou made an unprecedented public apology in 2010 after the suicides. Foxconn said it had introduced counselors, started a 24-hour phone counseling service and opened a stress room where workers can take out frustration on mannequins with bats. In January the company published a statement saying it is ""committed to honoring and respecting the codes of conduct of our customers, our own policies and practices, and the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where we do business."" Addressing specific criticisms, the company said all employees were given regular breaks, access to healthcare, a safe environment to work in and the opportunity for promotion to other technical or line management positions. The statement concluded by saying Foxconn was ""not perfect"" but had made ""tremendous progress"" with the positive impact its programs were having on employees. What does Apple say? Apple CEO Tim Cook recently responded to a report in the New York Times that described the ""human cost"" of building an IPad at the Foxconn plants. In an email to Apple employees, he said the company had never turned a blind eye"" to the problems in its supply chain and any suggestion it does not care about the plight of workers is ""patently false."" ""We care about every worker in our worldwide supply chain"" the company added in a statement issued Sunday. ""We insist that our suppliers provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever Apple products are made. Our suppliers must live up to these requirements if they want to keep doing business with Apple."" In the 2011 edition of its supplier progress report, Apple said Cook and other senior company representatives had visited Foxconn's Shenzhen plant a year earlier to evaluate conditions there following reports of suicide attempts. Apple then commissioned an independent review by a team of suicide prevention experts. This team was asked to conduct a deeper investigation -- which included speaking with workers and site managers -- evaluate Foxconn's response, and recommend strategies for supporting workers' mental health in the future. According to this year's supplier progress report, workers in Shenzhen now have access to free psychological counseling, including a 24-hour hotline, to get advice on their personal and professional concerns. Apple also pointed to the establishment of its employee assistance program (EAP), which is focused on social-support networks and ""maintaining employee mental health."" The 2012 report also provided a list of Apple's leading production suppliers for the first time, with each one subject to an audit of safety and the environmental conditions. It said one of the most significant improvements had been in clamping down on labor violations -- specifically the use of underage workers. The same report also responded to last year's deadly explosion at Foxconn's Chengdu plant, saying new requirements for handling combustible dust throughout its supply chain had been established. These included better ventilation and more comprehensive inspections at production facilities.","Foxconn is one of the world's largest suppliers of components for the electronics industry .

"(CNN) -- Can mounting radar sensors or cameras on cars help prevent some traffic jams? New research suggests so. When a car slows quickly and unexpectedly, it can trigger a chain reaction in the cars behind it and create traffic slowdowns. It doesn't take construction or a fender-bender to disrupt traffic on a highway, just one driver hastily hitting his brakes. But Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Berthold Horn has developed an algorithm he thinks can be used by cars to better reduce these kinds of ""phantom"" traffic jams: slowdowns not caused by obvious culprits like accidents or road repairs. Using Horn's system, multiple cars would detect the velocity and distance of the cars in front and behind them and then regulate their speed to avoid sudden braking and maintain a more consistent speed. Horn told the MIT News Office that one driver braking suddenly can have a ripple effect, increasing in amplitude, on the line of cars behind them, even if the driver just hit the brakes for a moment. Completely autonomous car technology is under development at universities, car companies and even Google. But Horn's system isn't just for cars in the far-off future. He believes that it could be used by existing vehicles that have a feature called adaptive cruise control, which is found on some high-end cars. Cars with adaptive cruise control are outfitted with radar sensors or digital cameras on the front of the vehicle. They detect nearby cars and gauge how far away they are and how fast they're going. In addition to keeping a preset speed, a car with adaptive cruise control automatically adjusts the brakes and throttle to stay a safe distance from the cars ahead of it. The system is great for people who often hit stop-and-go traffic during their commutes. It can slow down when necessary to avoid accidents and rev back up to the maximum desired cruising speed. But Horn's system would take this a step further by adding sensors on the back of the car as well. A car that stays roughly halfway between those in front of it and behind it would be less likely to pass on any disruptions in speed to the car behind it. Horn describes his system as ""bilateral control,"" and it works best when a lot of cars on the road are using it. The algorithm takes into account other human factors, like drivers' reaction time and typical behaviors such as speeding up to close gaps between cars. Horn, who researches computer vision, came up with the idea to create a computer simulation of these types of traffic issues after dealing with backups on interstates in Massachusetts. Mounting cameras or sensors on cars is still a new and expensive technology, but it is a key part of automated driving advancements. In the future, cars could communicate with each other and share information about speed and traffic to better address issues that individual drivers can't fix on their own. Horn presented his findings this month at a transportation conference.","Many traffic slowdowns are just chain reactions started by cars hastily slowing down .

"(The Frisky) -- Everyone's favorite charmer, George Clooney, is suiting up to play a hired assassin trying to get out of the profession after one last assignment in ""The American."" The flick comes out in September and it's about time that Clooney gave James Bond a run for his money! He's charismatic, cheeky, and looks fantastic in a suit how can you go wrong? In honor of this new development, we've rounded up the sexiest male spies of all time! Cue the ""spy who shagged me"" jokes. Clive Owen really steamed up the big screen with Julia Roberts in ""Duplicity"" as rival spies engaging in espionage and foreplay. He also plays the best kind of spy, relying on his charisma and smarts instead of crazy gadgets. Matt Damon's made a pretty fantastic spy as Jason Bourne in ""The Bourne Identity"" and its sequels. As a government assassin afflicted with amnesia, Damon runs around trying to solve his identity crisis while the CIA tries to kill him. He makes the classic playboy spy stereotype seem crass with his boyish good looks and devotion to his lady love. The Frisky: Amanda Bynes is retiring at age 24! Other young starlets we'd like to see throw in the towel . It's hard to pinpoint who the sexiest Bond was, but Pierce Brosnan did a good job of it in 1995's ""Goldeneye."" Between the British accent and the sophisticated chivalry, it was easy to see why women were throwing themselves at him when they were supposed to be taking him out. Plus, Brosnan is just so ridiculously pretty. The Frisky: Kate Gosselin seeks her bodyguard's approval before getting breast implants? I'd forgotten how dashing Harrison Ford was in his prime, but he really tugged at our heart strings in 1992's ""Patriot Games."" As a retired CIA agent, Harrison was forced to take on one last mission when a political group tried to kill his family. When you combine spy with family man, it becomes even harder not to love him! His character is irreverent and passionate and no offense to Chris Pine, who'll be reprising the role in 2012's ""Moscow"" but Ford can't be easily replaced. The Frisky: Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart finally wed! Which celebrity couples waited the longest to tie the knot? The only reason a lot of us watched ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" was to see if the sparks between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were obvious. And they were indeed. As husband and wife rival spies, the two created amazing sexual tension which occasionally erupted in incredibly realistic ways. The Frisky: Do you remember your first kiss as well as these 10 celebs? The most-famous James Bond, Sean Connery, really set the bar high in movies like 1967's ""You Only Live Twice,"" where Bond brought his spy skills to Japan to find a rocket that disappeared in orbit. He was young, fit, and with the Scottish accent, it's no wonder that he slayed the ladies of Japan. In one of the best movies ever, ""Charade,"" Cary Grant plays a name-changing government official who offers to help Audrey Hepburn find her dead husband's fortune, which was stolen from the government during World War II. A phony CIA agent and cast of sketchy characters are convinced Hepburn's character knows where the money is and won't let her rest until the mystery is solved. Bring on the Cold War spy shenanigans! The Frisky: Insane behavior on ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey"" -- has Bravo gone too far? With all the Scientology business, it's easy to forget that Tom Cruise was once a total heartthrob. But way back in 1996, he was a pretty convincing spy in ""Mission: Impossible."" The gravity-defying acrobatics, black leather, and futuristic gadgets made Cruise a fantastic action star and we'll have to see if he's still got it in him when he plays a secret agent in ""Knight and Day,"" which opens this week. The Frisky: Does a racy, fictionalized version of Anne Frank's diary go too far? In one of the first Bond movies women were equally anxious to see, Daniel Craig brought new elements to 007 in ""Casino Royale.""

"London, England (CNN) -- Research teams at the Danish Golf Union have discovered it takes between 100 to 1,000 years for a golf ball to decompose naturally. A startling fact when it is also estimated 300 million balls are lost or discarded in the United States alone, every year. It seems the simple plastic golf ball is increasingly becoming a major litter problem. The scale of the dilemma was underlined recently in Scotland, where scientists -- who scoured the watery depths in a submarine hoping to discover evidence of the prehistoric Loch Ness monster -- were surprised to find hundreds of thousands of golf balls lining the bed of the loch. It is thought tourists and locals have used the loch as an alternative driving range for many years. The footage shot by underwater robotics team SeaTrepid, can be seen below. With an increasing number of golf balls discarded each year, the Danish Golf Association devised a number of tests to determine the environmental impact of golf balls on their surroundings. It was found that during decomposition, the golf balls dissolved to release a high quantity of heavy metals. Dangerous levels of zinc were found in the synthetic rubber filling used in solid core golf balls. When submerged in water, the zinc attached itself to the ground sediment and poisoned the surrounding flora and fauna. Course manager for the Danish Golf Union, Torben Kastrup Petersen, said the scale of the problem is unknown: ""There has been very little research on the environmental impact of golf balls, but it's safe to say the indicators are not good. We are planning to collaborate with environmentalists in America to conduct more tests to fully explore the extent of the problem."" Local government ministers in Scotland have also complained about the level of golf ball littering.  UK lawmaker Patrick Harvie told CNN: ""From the moon to the bottom of Loch Ness, golf balls are humanity's signature litter in the most inaccessible locations."" And he's not wrong. On February 6, 1971, astronaut Alan Shepherd was filmed taking a swing with a six iron on the surface of the moon. According to Shepherd, the balls flew off in the distance and landed a few kilometers away. Although the balls were left for future golfers to discover, it is believed the extreme temperatures on the surface would have dissolved the balls many moons ago. In many cases, removing a partially degraded ball from a lake or woodland area could result in further damage to the wildlife. So what is the solution? Harvie had this advice: ""Keep your balls on the fairway or invest in a stock of biodegradable balls.""","It takes 100 to 1,000 years for a golf ball to degrade .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Capt. Carl Gamble was behind the controls of Piedmont Airlines Flight 451 as the plane headed to Miami when a stewardess delivered a note from a passenger saying the flight was being hijacked. Nearly 30 years later, Gamble still recalls the sense of dread wash over him as he read the hijacker's demand to be flown to Cuba. ""It's such a shock that for the first 30 seconds you can't remember your name,"" Gamble said. ""But then it all falls into place."" Gamble was an Air Force veteran who, exactly 15 years to the day of the hijacking, had been shot down in Vietnam. Over the plane's intercom system, Gamble tried to negotiate with the hijacker, a pistol-wielding man dressed in black, who called himself ""Lt. Spartacus."" The hijacker threatened to take the lives of the 57 passengers and crew aboard the plane if Gamble didn't fly him to Havana. In addition to the small pistol he had smuggled aboard, the hijacker claimed to have a bomb in his suitcase. ""He said he had a detonator,"" Gamble remembered, ""and that he was prepared to blow up the airplane."" Q&A: When hijackings were common . The airline told Gamble to comply with the hijacker's demands. The pilot remembers seeing U.S. military C-130s accompany him south and then, as he approached Cuban air space, turn back. Shortly after landing in Havana, Gamble said his plane was surrounded by a bright green swarm of Cuban soldiers. The Cubans had plenty of experience with hijacked planes from the United States. After Fidel Castro took power, the island became the go-to destination for dozens of hijackers -- some were aspiring revolutionaries, others common criminals seeking refuge in a country where the lack of diplomatic relations with the United States meant they were unlikely to be extradited. Gamble said the Cuban soldiers removed the passengers and crew, swept the plane for explosives and found nothing. Then the soldiers escorted the hijacker off the aircraft. ""I only got a glimpse of him,"" Gamble said. ""I never understood what he was trying to do."" U.S. doctors see American jailed in Cuba . This week, the world is getting another glimpse of the hijacker, a former Black Panther named William Potts, now 56, who returned to the United States on Wednesday to turn himself into authorities for the 1984 hijacking. FBI agents arrested him at Miami International Airport on charges of air piracy, federal prosecutors said in a statement. He is scheduled to make his first appearance in front of federal magistrate on Thursday. If convicted, prosecutors said, he faces a minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum term of life behind bars. Potts has already served time in Cuba for his crime. He had hijacked the plane thinking he would be greeted as fellow revolutionary and given military training so he could begin his own uprising in the United States. Instead, the Cuban government tried Potts and sentenced him to 15 years in prison. ""In a Machiavellian sense, the Cubans changed,"" Potts said. ""They simply changed. They used to do it and now they don't do it."" Instead of becoming the next Che Guevara, Potts found himself a foreigner who spoke little Spanish in crowded and often violent prisons. But he refused Cuban offers to return home. ""If you are not able to suffer for the cause you are just a play revolutionary,"" he said. Cuba and U.S. talk mail cooperation . Potts served his time and after leaving prison married and had two daughters with a Cuban woman. Although a minor celebrity in his neighborhood of crumbling Soviet buildings east of Havana, Potts never fully fit into Cuban society. He converted to Islam and often wears a prayer cap and flowing robes accessorized with a combat vest. The pidgin Spanish he learned behind bars is combined with the occasional word in English or Arabic . Potts said he yearns to see family, including two daughters born in Cuba who now live in the United States. And he said he no longer feels the same zeal he once did for Cuba's political system. ""Two generations were forced to sacrifice everything and we can't give our children a decent lunch, we can't give our old people a decent meal,"" he said. ""That's after 50 years of revolution."" Homesick American hijacker offers to return from Cuba . Even though he's a fugitive after being indicted by a U.S. court for the hijacking in 1985, Potts has been trying to turn himself over to U.S. authorities for more than a year. Federal prosecutors have never explained the year-long delay in bringing him into custody. In a statement Wednesday, U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer ""commended the investigative efforts of the FBI and the assistance of the Diplomatic Security Service, Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration in securing Potts's return to the United States."" Potts said before he could leave Cuba, U.S. diplomats had to issue him a single-use passport and an exemption from the no-fly list. There also were to be two U.S. marshals accompanying him on the flight to Miami on Wednesday, Potts said, in case he has second thoughts. But the one-time hijacker will return to an uncertain future. Potts was unable to negotiate a plea deal and, while he hopes any sentence he faces in the United States would be reduced by the time he has served, there are no guarantees. ""I did the crime but I did the time,"" Potts said before his arrest in the United States. ""I paid the price for that crime I committed, I am entitled to a second chance."" When he sent his daughters to live in the United States and watched their plane take off, he said he was filled with regret for having hijacked a plane. ""I live with the dread of what would have happened if the plane went down,"" Potts said. ""I didn't have that perspective at the time, but I have it now and will have it until the day I die. I would have been responsible for all those people dying."" It's not clear whether Potts will ask for forgiveness from the passengers and crew of Flight 451, many of whom are no longer alive or only dimly recall their brief diversion to Cuba. Now retired after 37 years of flying, Carl Gamble vividly remembers the ordeal of the hijacking, trying to keep the plane's passengers calm while complying with Potts' orders. Asked whether he would accept an apology from Potts, Gamble said he holds no grudges. ""I would consider it,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Odin Lloyd texted his sister in the wee hours of June 17. ""NFL. Just so you know."" At the time, according to prosecutors, Lloyd was in a silver Nissan Altima with Aaron Hernandez, a star tight end with the NFL's New England Patriots, and two other people. About 3:25 a.m. -- two minutes after the message went out -- gunshots shattered the quiet night in a southeastern Massachusetts industrial park, according to witnesses. Not five minutes passed before a surveillance camera at his North Attleborough home captured video of Hernandez carrying what appears to be a gun, prosecutors said. Lloyd lay dead about a mile away. The video is among the evidence prosecutors are gathering in their case against Hernandez, 23, who is set to be arraigned Friday. Let go by the Patriots, Hernandez will step into a courtroom for the sixth time since his June 26 arrest. He's expected to formally plead not guilty to first-degree murder in the death of Lloyd, a 27-year-old semipro football player. ""He's bearing up under the pressure,"" defense attorney Michael Fee said when Hernandez was indicted last month. ""He understands what's in front of him, and he's committed to clearing his name."" Fee has told reporters that the case against his client, who is being held without bond, is circumstantial. ""There's an incredible rush to judgment in this case,"" according to the attorney. For his part, according to a TMZ report last month, Hernandez declared his innocence as he responded to a fan letter, saying that ""all the people who turned on me will feel like crap."" Investigation continues in another case . Friday's arraignment comes as authorities continue to investigate Hernandez in connection with an unsolved 2012 double homicide case in Boston. Investigators have obtained July 2012 video surveillance allegedly showing Hernandez at a nightclub at the same time as two men who were fatally shot that night, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. The video apparently does not show Hernandez interacting with Daniel Abreu, 29, and Safiro Furtado, 28, according to a law enforcement source. The development was first reported Wednesday by the Hartford Courant. Boston police have said the men were inside a BMW sprayed with gunfire after they left the nightclub. Law enforcement sources said they believe Hernandez rented a silver SUV with Rhode Island registration that was linked to the scene of the double homicide. After Lloyd's murder, Bristol, Connecticut police discovered the vehicle by accident while searching the garage of Hernandez's uncle, a law enforcement source told CNN. Boston police had been looking for the vehicle for almost a year, law enforcement sources added. Hernandez has not been charged in the unsolved double shooting. His attorneys have previously declined to comment to CNN when asked about the ongoing Boston investigation. Defense: Jury will find him 'innocent' A Bristol County, Massachusetts, grand jury last month indicted Hernandez on a first-degree murder and five weapons charges. Prosecutors say Hernandez orchestrated the shooting of his friend Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Fee said he was pleased with the indictment because it gave his client ""a path to trial,"" and that a jury will find Hernandez ""innocent."" Police have not located the gun believed to have been used in the Lloyd killing. But prosecutors say Hernandez returned a rental car with a bullet casing that allegedly matched bullets found at the scene. Surveillance cameras showed the car believed to be carrying Hernandez and the others at the industrial park, according to authorities. Hernandez has been sitting in a jail cell as his former team, known for its stellar offense, contends for another Super Bowl title. The Patriots open their regular season Sunday against the Buffalo Bills. In his letter to the fan, as reported by TMZ, the fallen NFL star said the world makes things ""out of false accusations"" and that he will be exonerated. ""I know there is a reason I'm going thru this and I will figure it out through my relationship with the Lord,"" Hernandez wrote. CNN's Laura Dolan, Lorenzo Ferrigno, Greg Botelho and Laura Ly and HLN's Amanda Sloane contributed to this report.","Aaron Hernandez is slated for arraignment Friday .

"(CNN) -- Health officials announced Friday a campaign to vaccinate more than 20 million children against polio and other diseases across much of the Middle East. ""The headline is the Middle East is reinfected,"" said Dr. Bruce Aylward, the World Health Organization's assistant director-general for polio, emergencies and country collaboration. The announcement, by WHO and UNICEF, comes a week after an outbreak of polio was confirmed in Syria for the first time since 1999. Ten children have been left paralyzed, and hundreds of thousands are at risk. Given that the virus paralyzes anywhere from 1 in 200 to 1 in 1,000 of the people it infects, ""that means you've got probably thousands infected,"" Aylward told CNN in a telephone interview. ""So, if you do a campaign to respond, it would have to cover basically all of Syria."" Most of the victims are younger than 2 years of age, born since violence erupted in March 2011, wracking the country and shredding its once-robust public health infrastructure. ""We will expect to see more cases, certainly in Syria if not in surrounding countries,"" Sonia Bari, a spokeswoman for polio eradication for WHO, said in a telephone interview. Syria's immunization rates have dropped from more than 90% before the conflict began in March 2011 to 68% now, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said Friday in a prepared statement. Already, more than 650,000 children in Syria have been vaccinated, including 116,000 in the northeast province of Deir Ezzor, where the outbreak was confirmed, the OCHA statement said. The campaign also will target Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and the West Bank and Gaza. Over the past year, the virus has been discovered in sewage samples from Egypt, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, a region that has not seen polio cases for nearly a decade, it said. Transmission of the virus occurs through close person-to-person contact and consumption of food or drink contaminated with feces. ""Preliminary evidence indicates that the poliovirus is of Pakistani origin and is similar to the strain detected in Egypt, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip,"" the OCHA statement said. Pakistan is one of three countries -- the others are Nigeria and Afghanistan -- where polio remains endemic. But Aylward said health officials have a good chance of halting its spread in Syria, where 1.6 million children are to be vaccinated against not only polio, but against measles, mumps and rubella. ""They have a great history of vaccination in Syria; the immunity gap is in a relatively small part of the population,"" he said. In addition, the region is entering its cool season, when transmission would typically slow, he said. Aylward said he met last week with Syria's minister of health and was impressed by the response. ""Everybody's playing ball,"" he said. But it's a dangerous game. ""The virus is unforgiving -- both what it does to kids and what it does to epidemiologists trying to stop it,"" he said. Over the past few days, more than 18,000 children at Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan have been vaccinated, with a national goal of reaching 3.5 million people. Vaccinations have also begun in western Iraq, with more planned for the Kurdistan Region in the north in coming days. And the campaign is slated to begin this week across Lebanon, and in Turkey and Egypt by the middle of this month. Though there is no cure for polio, it can be prevented through vaccination, which is credited with slashing cases around the world by more than 99% since 1988.","NEW: ""The Middle East is reinfected,"" says WHO polio expert .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe swore in his new government Wednesday and confirmed that the new 26-member Cabinet, mainly composed of allies from his previous appointments, will not abandon his controversial policy of seizing the majority stake of foreign-owned firms. The 89-year-old leader told journalists after the Cabinet's installation that Zimbabwe's economic recovery will be anchored on mining, manufacturing and agriculture industries. ""We want to see the drive and we want to see indigenization done,"" Mugabe said at State House after he had been asked if a change of personnel in the Indigenization Ministry, which oversees the takeover policy, meant a change of stance. Zimbabwe had had no functioning Cabinet since the July 31 elections when Mugabe was re-elected. Between 2009 and this year, Mugabe's Zanu PF party and former Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's MDC party shared power. The new Cabinet retains the Ministry of Indigenization, the policy of seizing the majority stake of foreign owned firms and giving them to black Zimbabweans. Critics of the policy have said it mainly benefits a few elites. On Wednesday, Mugabe said most African countries like Sudan and Gabon are lagging behind as ""whites"" exploit the continent's resources. ""That is exploitation. That is theft by using crook-ish means to steal the wealth of Africa. Ah. Lets reject that,"" said Africa's oldest leader, who will finish his new term when he is 94 and will be able to stand for another term . The Cabinet also includes Jonathan Moyo as media, information and broadcasting services minister. He was the one who drafted tough media laws in 2002 that have resulted in the deportation of foreign journalists and the closing of some media organizations. Mugabe tossed him out of Zanu PF after Moyo stood as an independent in the 2008 elections. Former Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa is now the finance minister, taking over from Tendai Biti, who was from the MDC party under the 2009-2013 coalition government. On Wednesday, the opposition described the Cabinet as ""dead wood."" Mugabe and Zanu PF got more than a two-thirds majority in parliament in the July 31 elections.","Mugabe confirms continuation of seizing the majority stake of foreign-owned firms .

"(CNN) -- ""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever"" had few fans upon its release in 2002. The $70 million movie, starring Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu, was a box office failure, making just $14.3 million domestically and less than $6 million overseas. Antonio Banderas, above, and Lucy Liu starred as dueling secret agents in 2002's ""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever."" And critics were scathing. ""A career low for both Liu and Banderas,"" said Empire magazine. ""Ecks this one off your must-see list,"" wrote the New York Post's Lou Lumenick. But, seven years after its release, ""Ecks"" can now claim one honor: It's the worst movie of the decade, according to RottenTomatoes.com, the movie review aggregator site.  Watch clips from Top 25 worst movies on list » . With the aughts winding down and September traditionally a rough month for movies, Rotten Tomatoes decided it was a good time to update an old list of bad movies and look at some of this decade's worst, said Matt Atchity, the site's editor-in-chief. ""We've seen some really, really poorly reviewed movies in the last few weeks,"" he said. ""That kind of made us think ... to update this list and focus on the last 10 years."" ""Ecks"" received a unanimous thumbs-down, giving it a 0 percent Tomatometer rating. Thirteen other movies in Rotten Tomatoes' horrible hundred also had zero good reviews -- including 2002's ""Pinocchio"" (the Roberto Benigni version) and 2004's ""Superbabies"" (directed by ""Christmas Story"" auteur Bob Clark), but no other movie came close to ""Ballistic's"" expansive perfection: 107 reviews, none good. Atchity said it's rare for a movie to pick up a goose egg on the Tomatometer. ""Usually some [reviewer], somewhere, likes something,"" he said. Besides, Atchity added, it's all relative. Though the oeuvre of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer -- the makers of critically reviled parody films such as ""Epic Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans"" -- included four movies on the worst 100 list, their films routinely do well at the box office. Still, Atchity defends the role of movie critics, themselves much reviled (and, given the struggles of newspapers and the rise of social media, much unemployed) in recent years. Critics may not be able to doom a bad movie, but they can give a boost to small good ones -- and they keep a dialogue going about movies in general, he said. ""I think that criticism in this day and age becomes even more important, because you can't, as a moviegoer, let the studio's marketing arms dictate what you're seeing,"" he said. ""I think it's important as a society that we be discussing the art we're consuming."" Which brings us back to ""Ecks vs. Sever."" Could it be an overlooked classic? Well, no. ""It's pretty bad,"" Atchity said.","RottenTomatoes.com ranked 100 worst films of this decade .

"(CNN) -- Former World No.5 Anna Chakvetadze is making her latest comeback after a 2011 marred by illness and capped with an unsuccessful bid to win election to Russia's Duma. Chakvetadze's problems began when she dramatically collapsed on court while leading World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki in a second round match in Dubai. ""When I got sick in Dubai I was in very good shape,"" Chakvetadze told the official WTA website. ""I was finally enjoying the way I was playing. I was feeling the ball great. I had found my game again and was really ready to compete. But then I got sick."" She was to play only three main draw matches in the remainder of the year, slipping to 234 in the rankings, before the illness was diagnosed as an inflammation of the inner year which caused dizziness and effected her balance. ""I'm 100 per cent healthy now. It doesn't bother me anymore. I'm completely over it."" Former World No.1 Safin elected to Russian federal parliament . While away from tennis, the 24-year-old dabbled in politics, standing for the Right Cause Party in December's elections. But with her party polling less than one per cent in the election, for now Chakvetadze's political ambitions are on hold. ""I met some new people and really enjoyed myself. It was great to try myself in a different world. ""While I will do something if my party asks me to, right now my priority is sport. I spend my days on the tennis court. Tennis comes first for me,"" she said. Chakvetadze will head to Hobart in Tasmania for the first tournament of 2012 ahead of a tilt at the Australian Open later in January. She reached her career-high ranking in 2007 when she won four tournaments and made the semifinals of the U.S. Open. But in December of that year she suffered a horrifying ordeal when her home was burgled and the intervening years have been marked by a series of injuries and loss of form.

"(CNN) -- A Pakistani court Tuesday indicted President Pervez Musharraf, charging him with murder in the death of the country's first female prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. It marked the first time an ex-military chief has been indicted with a crime in the country, his spokesman Raza Bokhari said. The court charged Musharraf with murder, criminal conspiracy to murder, and facilitation of murder. Bhutto was assassinated in a gun-suicide attack in December 2007, shortly after she came back to Pakistan from self-imposed exile to take part in the 2008 general elections. Musharraf was president and military chief at the time, and Bhutto was a leading opposition figure. Bhutto's son steps into the political spotlight . Musharraf was in court Tuesday for the indictment. He denies any involvement in Bhutto's death. The next court proceedings in the case are scheduled for August 27. ""The politically motivated indictment... is not only false, fabricated and fictitious, but is also an undignified attempt to smear the honor and integrity of the former president on the world stage,"" Musharraf spokesman Raza Bokhari said in a statement. The indictment comes after a preliminary judicial process in which authorities presented their case against him. The indictment means that the court concluded he has to answer for the allegations. Although Musharraf has been accused of other crimes in the country, no other cases have gotten as far as an indictment. Just two weeks ago, Musharraf's attorney said Musharraf was expected to be charged with failing to provide adequate security for Bhutto -- not murder. After the assassination, Musharraf's government blamed former Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, saying he had paid a network of Islamist militants to carry out the killing. Bhutto had the ""same security and threats"" that Musharraf faces now, Bokhari told CNN Tuesday. ""It is unfair to blame a sitting head of state for complicity in a violent action that occurs in a country."" After the general elections in 2008 in which his party was trounced, Musharraf stepped down as the governing coalition began taking steps to impeach him. He then went into self-imposed exile. From president to exile . Earlier this year, he returned to Pakistan in an attempt to revive his political career. It didn't work. Instead, he's become entangled in a thicket of court cases related to his time as the country's top leader. He has been under house arrest since April. He is under investigation for the 2006 assassination of Nawab Akbar Bugti, a popular tribal leader, in the volatile province of Balochistan. He is also accused of detaining judges and their family members and wrongdoing related to the storming of the Lal Masjid mosque, where militants had holed up. Musharraf has been under house arrest in the suburbs of Islamabad. Along with him, nine others face related accusations, including three senior police officers. The recently elected government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, a longtime political foe of Musharraf, has also suggested that the former military ruler should stand trial for treason. Sharif has accused Musharraf of illegally abrogating the constitution in November 2007. That month, Musharraf declared a state of emergency, suspended Pakistan's constitution, replaced the chief judge and blacked out independent TV outlets. Musharraf said he did so to stabilize the country and to fight rising Islamic extremism. Such a prosecution of a former top general would be likely to strain the already delicate relations between Sharif and Pakistan's powerful military. Pakistan votes: Key moments of a turbulent past .

"Tallahassee, Florida (CNN) -- How did two convicted murderers allegedly get their hands on forged documents that granted them early release from a Florida prison? Authorities believe it all started with one inmate teaching another how to fabricate the legal paperwork. From inside the Franklin Correctional Institution in North Carrabelle, south of Tallahassee in Florida's Panhandle, Nydeed Nashaddai apparently trained inmates how to create the legal-looking documents with bogus signatures of prosecutors and judges, Gretl Plessinger, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Law Enforcement, told CNN on Wednesday. One of 2 Florida escapees ordered sent back to Franklin Correctional Institution . Nashaddai used a similar technique in 2009 to walk away from the Pinellas County Jail before authorities figured out the scheme and recaptured him a day later, according to prison records. The revelation came the same day that the head of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement told state lawmakers that Charles Walker and Joseph Jenkins had help inside and outside the prison to pull off their elaborate escape. ""There is a group, a gang, inside. They worked with people outside,"" Commissioner Gerald Bailey, head of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, told the Appropriations Subcommittee on Criminal and Civil Justice. Fake papers for Florida cons called 'cottage industry' Neither Plessinger nor Bailey said whether investigators believe Nashaddai taught the two men directly. He is no longer housed at Franklin Correctional, Plessinger said. She did not say when he was transferred or why. Citing confidential inmate sources, Bailey told the panel that the documents were sent out by the prisoners to people on the outside, who in turn filed the bogus documents. Walker and Jenkins, both 34, had been serving life terms without parole for unrelated killings at Franklin Correctional Institution when they allegedly escaped. Jenkins walked out September 27, while Walker left October 8. Both used legal-looking documents with bogus reproductions of several key players' signatures, including those of the Orlando-area state attorney and Judge Belvin Perry, plus the seal of the Orange County clerk of court's office. Both men were recaptured in late October and now face escape charges. Bailey did not identify those who allegedly helped the men, telling lawmakers only that there is a list of suspects. There also is no evidence of employee involvement, he said. State officials have been investigating the scam for about a year and had warned state prosecutors about the schemes over the summer, authorities have said. Authorities have not detailed how the inmates allegedly pulled off the scheme. But the escape has prompted a review of law libraries in state prisons as well as inmate use of computers and processing equipment ""to make sure we are not giving them too much,"" Michael Crews, head of the Florida Department of Corrections, told the committee. State prisons are also strengthening their review of prisoner releases, he said. Any future judicial order that changes the release date of an inmate will be verified with the judge who signed it, Crews said. To date, the state Department of Corrections has reviewed 7,800 of more than 9,300 prison release documents for possible fraud, Crews said. So far, no fraud has been detected, he said. Perry, the judge whose signature was forged, recommended to the legislature that penalties for doctoring and forging documents be increased. Among the evidence authorities have collected in connection with the escape arrests is a cell phone that was seized in the prison, Plessinger said. She did not identify whom the phone belonged to, only that it was ""one of the inmates connected to this gang or group of people."" Plessinger did not detail the evidence collected on the phone, saying only ""it's been a vital source of information."" While Bailey did not specifically address the cell phone during his testimony before lawmakers, he did say investigators were analyzing documents, electronic devices and a ""history of calls and text messages to and from Walker and Jenkins.""

"New York (CNN) -- More than 250 illegal guns have been seized by the New York City Police Department in the largest gun bust in the city's history, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Monday. The guns were smuggled into New York City from North Carolina and South Carolina between September 2012 and July 2013 through two separate trafficking operations, according to a news release from the city's special narcotics prosecutor. Walter Walker, 29, of Sanford, North Carolina, and Earl Campbell, 24, of Rock Hill, South Carolina, are accused of hiding the firearms in luggage carried on buses that offer cheap fares and operate near Manhattan's Chinatown neighborhood, authorities said. They sometimes transported as many as 14 firearms at a time, and the guns were usually sold within hours of arriving in the city, authorities said. It is not clear which bus companies they used to travel to and from New York. An undercover police officer met with Walker and Campbell separately more than 45 times and bought 254 guns, whose sales totaled nearly $160,000. Wiretaps of cell phone conversations and text messages revealed co-conspirators who assisted them in obtaining the weapons for sale, authorities said in a statement. Five things to know about guns . ""Year after year, guns flow into our city from states that don't have commonsense gun laws that keep guns out of the hands of criminals. North and South Carolina, for instance, still have weak laws that allow criminals and traffickers to easily buy guns,"" Bloomberg said. The 254 guns sold included high-capacity assault weapons, a fully automatic machine gun, and guns that are commonly used in violent crimes. Those included pistols and guns that can hold magazines with 30 or more rounds, according to Bloomberg. Walker and Campbell are among 19 people arrested in association with the case. All face numerous counts of conspiracy, criminal sale of a firearm, criminal possession of a weapon and other crimes. It was not clear who their defense attorneys were as of Monday evening. Walter and Campbell worked separately but used similar methods in their operations. Both employed a network of individuals in their respective hometowns who had access to black market guns and who were aware that the guns would be illegally resold in New York City. They also recruited associates in New York, who assisted them in conducting sales. The weapons sold fetched at least three times their original price, according to the police department. Bloomberg said Monday that the percentage of guns used in crimes that are brought in from out of state had increased from 85 to 90%. Two of the top sources for gun crimes in New York are North and South Carolina, he said. ""It is impossible to know exactly how many victims might have suffered had officers not identified and investigated these gun traffickers,"" said Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. ""But thanks to the undercover officer in this case and the efforts of the NYPD Firearms Investigations Unit and prosecutors, instead of being used in crimes these guns are now out of commission."" Of the 19 people charged, seven have been arraigned in Manhattan Superior Court. Another nine are currently in custody in North Carolina. Three were already in prison on unrelated charges.

"(CNN) -- Amnesty International is calling on Zambia to release two men who have been in jail since May on charges of engaging in homosexual acts ""against the order of nature."" James Mwansa and Philip Mubiana, both 22, will appear in court Monday for a judge to decide if they should be detained longer. ""It is high time that individuals stopped being persecuted because of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Human rights are about the dignity and equality of all people,"" said Simeon Mawanza, Amnesty International's Zambia researcher. The pair was arrested after a neighbor reported them to the police, according to Amnesty International. Authorities subjected them to anal examinations without their consent and forced them to confess, the human rights group said. ""Anal examinations conducted to 'prove' same-sex conduct are scientifically invalid, and if they were conducted without the men's consent, contravene the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment under international law,"" said Simeon Mawanza, an Amnesty researcher in Zambia. It was the second detention for the two men in recent days, the group said. On April 25, authorities arrested them, and later released them on bail on May 2. They were arrested again just four days later after a neighbor went to the police, according to Amnesty. Both have pleaded not guilty. Zambian officials were not immediately available for comment. Homosexuality is illegal in Zambia and most African countries based on remnants of sodomy laws introduced during the British colonial era and perpetuated by cultural beliefs. Punishments across the continent range from fines to years in prison. Last year, a Cameroon appeals court upheld a three-year sentence against a man convicted of homosexuality for texting his male friend to say, ""I'm very much in love with you."" South Africa -- one of the more progressive nations in the continent on the issue -- was the first African country to impose a constitutional ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation. But sexual violence against lesbians has become so common in South Africa, the nation has coined the term ""corrective rape"" to describe it. A handful of other nations issue a death penalty for consensual same-sex relations, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.","Authorities subject them to anal examinations without their consent, a rights group says .

"New York (CNN) -- A New Jersey man who breached airport security to give his girlfriend a kiss, causing scores of flight delays, pleaded guilty Tuesday to defiant trespass, his lawyer said. Haisong Jiang, 28, pleaded guilty to a charge that is a ""petty disorderly persons offense ... it's below a crime, it's not even considered a crime in New Jersey,"" his lawyer, Eric B. Bruce said. Jiang apologized. ""I made big mistake, and I also learned a big lesson in my life,"" he told reporters after the court appearance. Bruce said that Jiang, a Rutgers University Ph.D. candidate who is originally from China, ducked under a rope and entered a security area at Newark Liberty International Airport on January 3 to give his girlfriend a kiss. The security breach shut down Terminal C for hours and forced the rescreening of thousands of passengers. Scores of flights were delayed. Jiang will have to pay a $500 fine and court fees and costs of $158, as part of a plea deal reached with prosecutors, Bruce said. He also will have to perform 100 hours of community service. He is ""very relieved,"" Bruce said. He said the nature of Jiang's community service has not yet been determined. ""We hope it'll be at a hospital, soup kitchen, medical clinic, something like that,"" he said. Jiang was arrested on January 8, several days after the security breach. Security video from the incident shows a Transportation Security Administration officer who left his post unattended a few minutes after he asked an unidentified man in a light-colored jacket to stay behind the rope line. Moments later, the man ducks under the rope and walks the wrong way through security to greet a woman. The lawyer said Jiang and his girlfriend, who lives in California, are still together. ""They are still together, and they are still very much in love,"" he said. Bruce said the charge will appear on Jiang's record. ""It can be expunged after, I believe, five years. It's an arrest, it's going to show on his record, but it's a very minor infraction,"" he said. The lawyer said that the incident will not affect Jiang's immigration status, CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey reported. He will likely finish his Ph.D. at Rutgers in May or June, Bruce said. Jiang is doing research on a cure for glaucoma, cataracts and other eye diseases. After the security breach, TSA said it would use the incident as a ""hard lesson"" to reinforce a ""sharp focus and tight discipline"" at the agency's stations across the country. The incident also prompted Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, to introduce legislation that would create a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for intentionally breaching airport security and a criminal penalty of up to 10 years in prison. It would also mandate the use of security cameras at all airport terminal checkpoints and secure area exits at every U.S. airport. Although the cameras are now recommended for airports, Lautenberg said they are not mandated by law. Soon after the security breach occurred, Lautenberg had called on the person who had caused the breach to turn himself in, saying ""You've committed what essentially is a crime.""","Haisong Jiang, 28, pleaded guilty to defiant trespass, his attorney said .

"(CNN) -- A Pakistan Taliban commander possibly linked to the assassination attempt on teenage activist Malala Yousafzai has been elevated to leader of the terrorist group. The Pakistan Taliban elected Maulana Fazlullah, one of its longtime militia commanders, as their new leader, spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said Thursday. The previous leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in northwestern Pakistan last week. Afghan President criticizes U.S. drone strike that killed Pakistani Taliban leader . Fazlullah once led a Pakistan Taliban militia in the country's Swat region. The Pakistani military ran Fazlullah's group out of Pakistan in 2009, forcing it to operate from Afghanistan. Pakistani military sources said Fazlullah is believed to be in Afghanistan and is believed to have been ordering attacks in Pakistan from there. Swat, in northwestern Pakistan, was where militants shot and wounded teen activist Malala in October 2012 as she was riding home from school in a van; the Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility. Fazlullah is known as a hard-liner who broadcast fiery sermons and hard-line ideology via an extremist radio station. The station was shut down when he was pushed out of Pakistan. The group's Central Shura Council picked Fazlullah, along with a new deputy leader, Sheikh Khalid Haqqani. Pakistani Prime Minister: Drone strike won't derail Taliban peace talks . The outgoing interim leader of the Pakistan Taliban, Asmatullah Shaheen, said Thursday that any discussions of talks with the Pakistani government are off the table. There were never truly talks between the two sides, Shaheen said, and there never will be. The Pakistan Taliban will focus their attacks on Punjab province, a stronghold of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Shaheen said. He blamed the Prime Minister for turning Pakistan into a ""colony"" of the United States and for the death of their former leader, Mehsud. During a trip to Washington, the Prime Minister sold Pakistan out, Shaheen said. ""Instead of stopping the drone strikes, he struck a deal with the United States for our leader's head,"" he said.","NEW: The Pakistan Taliban says they will focus attacks in Punjab province .

""I never did this, I never liked it. I had a few months of thinking 'should I do this or should I not' but now I am pretty sure of what I'm doing and I want to do it."" The 15-time winner on the ATP Tour explained how his experiences on court could help him in office. ""I will be working for the next five years day after day, sitting in an office, wearing a suit,"" he said. ""I will have good days, bad days and I will have to fight once again like I've been fighting on the court. It will be complicated."" Russian tennis star Chakvetadze courts electoral success .

"(CNN) -- Is the dome doomed? Voters may have given the Astrodome, Houston's iconic and once cutting-edge stadium, the kiss of death. It's too early to write an obituary for the structure once deemed the ""Eighth Wonder of the World,"" but the defeat of the bond initiative Tuesday night stacks the odds against the dome. Voters in Harris County were given a voice on whether to issue $217 million in bonds to transform the deteriorating structure into a mammoth exhibition and event space. The county owns the Astrodome, and its commissioners had warned that if the measure did not pass, the only course left would be to demolish it. The proposition was rejected by a 53%-47% vote. Harris County Judge Ed Emmett ""said that with voters rejecting the only viable public option and no viable private option on the table, there's little choice but to demolish the dome,"" the judge's spokesman, Joe Stinebaker, said. However, nothing can happen until the county commission meets and votes to go ahead with the demolition. The item has not been added to the commission's agenda, but it could happen as early as next Tuesday. A majority of the commissioners had said that if the proposition failed, that they would favor demolition. 6 imperiled and extinct sports sites . Nostalgia not lacking . Whether they voted for or against the measure to save the Astrodome, Houstonians share a nostalgia for the stadium. Completed in 1965, it was the first domed stadium in the world and was deemed a remarkable feat of engineering. The dome was the primary home of the Houston Astros and the Houston Oilers, in addition to hosting rodeos, concerts and other events. Stephen Chmaitelli, 38, remembers being dropped off at the Astrodome with his friends as children and catching a ball game before walking to the nearby (and now defunct) Astroworld theme park. ""It was a fun way to spend your days during the summer,"" he said. ""There are just so many memories there."" Chmaitelli voted in favor of saving the dome based on the renderings he saw of the kind of space the new dome would be. The space would make it bigger than the city's convention center, and the redesign would retain the feel of the old stadium while modernizing it. Remodeling made economic sense, he said: The county could not buy land in such a prime location and erect a structure of such ambition for such a good price. The Astrodome was always a symbol of pride for the city, said Bowen Shepard, a 32-year-old Houston native. But he voted against the resolution because the structure had already begun to fall into disrepair years ago. The dome looked outdated sitting next to the more modern Reliant Stadium, and fixing it up just didn't seem worth the cost, he said. ""Everything has its time, and everything's time comes to an end,"" he said. Endangered building . Months before the vote, before it was even announced that a vote would be held, the National Trust for Historic Preservation included the Astrodome on its yearly list of ""11 Most Endangered Historical Places."" On the same day that the Harris County revitalization proposal was floated, the trust named the dome one of 35 ""national treasures"" in the country. The designation meant that the trust put its resources to work in an attempt to save the Astrodome. ""We're disappointed this morning,"" Beth Wiedower, a senior field officer for the trust, said the day after the vote. ""I think (the outcome) was less of a comment on the value of the building, the heritage associated with it and more the confusion that surrounded the Astrodome these last years,"" she said. For the past five years, the Astrodome has been essentially vacant. The electricity and water are still on, but it is unoccupied and used mostly for storage. It costs the county an estimated $2 million to $3 million to maintain it, the county said. Several ideas from the private sector have appeared over the years, but nothing with funding. As ideas have come and gone, Wiedower believes that many voters misunderstood that Tuesday's vote may have been a definitive move on the building's fate. Now that the votes have been cast and the Astrodome is in serious jeopardy, Wiedower predicted there will be a great number of Houstonians who will regret the loss of the stadium. If the city indeed has a change of heart at this point, the only way out might be for a ""white knight"" from the private sector to swoop in with a plan, said Stinebaker, the county judge's spokesman.","Voters rejected a proposal to remodel and save the Astrodome .
The vote means that the historic stadium is likely to be demolished .
The Astrodome had been labeled a national treasure ."
"(CNN) -- Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed state police and the Division of Human Rights on Friday to investigate allegations of anti-Semitic harassment in a New York state school district. ""The reports of rampant anti-Semitic harassment and physical assaults at Pine Bush schools, if true, are deeply disturbing,"" Cuomo said in a statement to the state education commissioner. ""Here in New York State, we have zero tolerance for bigotry or hate based on anyone's religious or ethnic origin, and to that end, I have directed the State Police and the Division of Human Rights, to undergo a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding these acts,"" Cuomo added. His statement follows claims and a subsequent lawsuit from five students who attended school in the Pine Bush Central School District and were bullied and harassed, according to their lawyer Ilann M. Maazel. Maazel describes ""out of control anti-Semitism in the school district. The school failed at every level. This is one of the worst bullying cases I've seen."" The alleged physical attacks against Jewish students included a swastika drawn on a student's face against her will, the severe beating of one with a hockey stick, and repeated slapping of another in the head, according to the lawsuit that Maazel filed in 2012. Maazel adds that the harassment didn't stop, even after the lawsuit was filed. In addition, damage occurred on school property, such as drawn swastikas that remained ""for weeks or months,"" Cuomo said in the statement. The incidents reportedly occurred at Pine Bush Elementary School, Crispell Middle School and Pine Bush High School, all within the Pine Bush Central School District. Cuomo's statement came after the New York Times did a story about the case. The school district has also made a statement on the issue. ""The district takes all reports of discrimination or bullying seriously,"" said district superintendent Joan M. Carbone. ""As the litigation described in the New York Times article of November 8th, is still pending, the District can make no specific comment about the particulars of the lawsuit. We are hopeful that at the conclusion of this litigation, Pine Bush Central School District's actions will be vindicated."" The New York State Education Department filed a response to Cuomo's questions and call to action later on Friday. ""We share the governor's revulsion at the reports of heinous anti-Semitic acts at the Pine Bush Central School District,"" said Elizabeth R. Berlin, the executive deputy commissioner. She stated that this was the first time that the State Education Department had become aware of the allegations of anti-Semitism. Maazel said he did not know why the governor hadn't previously noticed the matter, though he added, ""I applaud any effort to investigate this huge problem."" Attorney General Eric Schneiderman released a statement as well, admonishing the ""blind eye"" that was taken to these instances of ""illegal bullying and discrimination."" The attorney general also said that his Civil Rights Bureau launched an ongoing investigation after it received complaints from Jewish students. Maazel told CNN that he was not aware of any investigation that the attorney general conducted. He said he was never contacted for questions or evidence by their office. Dennis Tompkins with the New York State Education Department said: ""We were not involved or aware of the attorney general's investigation. We have 4,500 schools; we try to maintain contact with all of them but can't."" Opinion: How the Web spreads anti-Semitism .","The reports "" if true, are deeply disturbing,"" Gov.

"(CNN) -- Cambodia and Thailand failed to resolve a weeklong military standoff over an ancient border temple that sits on disputed land. Cambodian Buddhist monks walk at Preah Vihear temple on Monday. An eight-hour meeting on Monday ended with both sides agreeing on only one point: that troops that  each country has amassed at the site of the Preah Vihear temple will not fire on each other, the Thai News Agency reported. Officials will reconvene after Cambodia's general election on July 27. For now, the countries are seeking regional intervention from their Southeast Asian neighbors. Foreign ministers of the 10 countries that comprise the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are meeting in Singapore this week. Cambodia has also sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council to call attention to the standoff. At the heart of the dispute is an 11th century temple to which Cambodia and Thailand lay claim. It sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962. Thailand claims, however, that the 1.8 square mile (4.6 square km) area around it was never fully demarcated. Thailand further says that the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia -- a map that places the temple and surrounding area in Cambodian territory. This month, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- a designation U.N. gives to places it deems of outstanding universal value. The decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple. Opposition parties in Thailand used the issue to attack the government, which initially backed the heritage listing. Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since the mid-1980s, has portrayed the U.N. recognition as a national triumph in the run-up to the general elections. The current flare-up began July 15, when Cambodian guards briefly detained three Thais who crossed into the area. Once they were let go, the three refused to leave the territory. Cambodia claims Thailand sent troops to retrieve the trio and gradually built up their numbers. Thailand denies that, saying its troops are deployed in Thai territory.","Officials will reconvene after Cambodia's general election on July 27 .

"(CNN) -- Brian Ludmer was running for his life, following other passengers trying to escape the gunshots being fired inside Terminal 3 of Los Angeles International Airport. He heard another shot. Then his right leg gave out, collapsing underneath him. ""The first thing is I immediately tried to stand back up. That didn't work. Both the bones in my right calf had been shattered, and it was completely loose. I collapsed again, "" Ludmer, 29, said by telephone Wednesday on CNN's ""AC360."" ""... I looked back and saw the gunman, and I didn't see anyone else. At that point, I expected that I might be shot again. So I knew I had to get away."" Bleeding badly, Ludmer began to crawl. Snapshot of the gunman . It was 9:20 a.m. Friday inside the crowded terminal that services Alaska Airlines, JetBlue, Spirit Airlines, Virgin America, Frontier Airlines and a number of other carriers. Ludmer, who on his way to Chicago for a wedding, was on the second floor of the terminal, waiting for his turn to clear a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint when he heard the shots. ""At that point, I think we were all afraid, and people did their best to get away from where we heard the gunshots,"" he said. ""I was just in with the crowd, running into the terminal."" Behind him, according to Los Angeles police authorities, 23-year-old Paul Ciancia had opened fire with a .223-caliber assault rifle, shooting and killing TSA Officer Gerardo Hernandez ""at point-blank range."" 'A matter of minutes:' Police check barely missed LAX suspect . Ciancia then went up an escalator but returned to shoot Hernandez again, apparently after seeing him move, according to a court document filed by the FBI. He continued walking and shooting. Witnesses said he went from person to person, asking, ""Are you TSA?"" One of those bullets hit Ludmer in the back of the right calf. On the ground, he looked back and saw the gunman. ""I have a snapshot of him I remember: Stern,"" Ludmer said. ""I don't know how to describe it. Cold, maybe."" But this much was clear to the teacher who worked at Calabasas High School: He had to move. 'Bleeding and disfigured' Ludmer began to crawl, dragging his broken and bleeding right leg toward a nearby duty-free shop. He crawled through the store, past the register and toward a door leading to a storage room. ""It was in there that I kind of grasped and took in for the first time what happened to my leg. It was bleeding and disfigured, and I was scared,"" Ludmer said. ""I knew I had to stem the blood flow, if I was going to survive."" Inside the room, he said, he saw a child's sweatshirt. He used it as a tourniquet, tying it as tightly as he could around the leg. Then he waited. Eventually, police found Ludmer as they were clearing the terminal, looking for a potential second gunman, he said. Days later, Ludmer is still being treated for the gunshot wound. He said he's undergone a number of surgeries and procedures. He's facing at least one more surgery, where doctors will place a metal rod in his leg, he said. The good news, he says: He has full sensation and movement in his right foot. Shooting reignites debate over TSA workers' role in security . CNN's Anderson Cooper contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- We don't know much about the shooting at Los Angeles International Airport just yet, but it has clearly jangled our collective nerves, dredging up the fear and shock and pain of 9/11 -- the wellspring of our modern airport security process -- reminding us that more than a decade later, flying is still a fraught experience. For those of us who were working for United or American, that day in 2001 changed everything. When we finally got back onboard, our workplace now included air marshals, armed pilots, martial arts lessons, tasers, fortified cockpit doors, and a new focus on vigilance, not warmth and customer service. ""Welcome aboard"" was less a greeting and more an opportunity to size you up. So, reports of today's airport shooting raise new fears about weaknesses in this system. Is it possible that the gunman who shot and killed one TSA officer and injured two of his colleagues may have made it through LAX security with a high-powered rifle? (As of this writing, that is not yet clear.) And is it time to start arming Transportation Security Administration officials? No way. I can understand the urge to react, to grasp at anything that might protect travelers. I too want air travel to be safe; hell, my husband is a pilot. But arming screeners at checkpoints well away from the airfield wouldn't be just another of the many precautions the airlines have taken to avert large-scale terrorism. It would simply be about protecting people from something that is everywhere in America: gun violence -- yes, at airports, and also at schools, at movie theaters, and malls. If you're the kind of person who thinks that every teacher and hall monitor and mall cop and cinema usher should be armed, then you'll probably feel safer if we give guns to TSA officers. And maybe flight attendants and customer service reps and baggage handlers. And probably bus drivers and ballpark ticket takers, and hospital staff. LAX shooting delays flights nationwide . September 11, 2001, still hurts, but most of our public killings have been at the hands of angry or disturbed co-workers, students, neighbors, family members -- not terrorists. Do you really want to start handing out guns to the people you work with? Probably not if you work for an airline where people are often underpaid, overworked, sometimes inhumanely exhausted and locked, perennially, in famously contentious relationships with management. Even before 9/11, it made me nervous that as airline workers, we skipped security entirely, simply hopping off the employee bus and entering a back door, bags and bodies unscreened. I feared that the next air disaster would be caused by a colleague with a bone to pick. Of course, I was wrong, and thankfully employees' bags are now screened, but giving guns to airline and airport workers is still a disquieting idea. I was never a fan of armed pilots, even in the nightmarish days after 9/11. Another flight attendant might have felt reassured but, when I once walked into the cockpit of a 757 to find a pilot with a gun resting on his lap, I was most decidedly rattled. I hadn't met the guy before and had no reason to distrust him, but even the thought of an accident was enough to make me question my safety (turbulence anyone?). And a couple of chilling mishaps -- an inadvertent discharge in the cockpit of a US Airways plane and an incident where a JetBlue pilot lost his gun in an airport -- demonstrate the potential dangers of even a best-case-scenario arming of the nation's nearly 50,000 TSA agents. Chaos, terror unfold inside LAX Terminal 3 . Unquestionably, terrorism is a real concern for airlines, but like it or not, as Americans, we have also have to worry just as much about angry neighbors with guns. To fight our justified fear, some will undoubtedly push for more guns and others for fewer. One thing is for certain -- we will continually be forced to debate this. I only hope that we can find some common ground before the next reminder. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tiffany Hawk.","Tiffany Hawk: 9/11 left a legacy of security measures by airlines and airports .

"(CNN) -- Would you feel comfortable flying in a plane with the exit sign missing from above its door? Along with dripping water appearing in the cabin shortly after takeoff, a missing exit sign was one of the details that rattled Australian passenger Lisa Kingsberry on a flight from Fiji to Vava'u in Tonga operated by Real Tonga airlines this week. The flight had originally been delayed two days due a sick pilot and weather conditions. ""I've never been on such an anxious flight,"" Kingsberry told Radio Australia. ""Everyone was talking about the safety issues."" The story has made headlines in Australia, with reports suggesting that the poor safety record and reputation of the aircraft used by Real Tonga -- a Chinese-manufactured MA60 aircraft -- is ""crippling"" tourism in Tonga. ""Earlier this year, the New Zealand Government suspended millions of dollars in tourism aid to Tonga and warned travelers of safety concerns over the plane,"" reported Australia Network News. ""New Zealand says the MA60 plane has been involved in a significant number of accidents in the past few years and is not certified to fly in New Zealand, Australia, Europe and the United States."" No plans to ground plane . But Real Tonga tells CNN it has no plans to suspend operations of its brand new MA60 -- manufactured by China's AVIC Xi'an Aircraft Industry Company -- which the government of Tonga received as a gift from China earlier this year. Configured to seat 42 passengers, the aircraft -- one of three operated by the airline and the only MA60 in its fleet -- made its maiden flight for the airline on August 10. ""There are no plans to ground it,"" said Real Tonga commercial manager Tele Faletau. ""We have no grounds on which we need to ground it."" MA60s have been involved in at least 11 mishaps since 2009. On June 10 of this year, an MA60 crash-landed at an airport in Indonesia, injuring two passengers; on the same day, an MA60 skidded off a runway in Myanmar, with no injuries reported. Though he confirmed that the MA60 flap has negatively affected Tonga's tourism industry and the airline itself, Faletau downplayed the worries. ""There were no reports (of problems) through our official maintenance on that flight,"" Faletau told CNN. Faletau explained that the exit sign in question is a detachable, foam piece that fits above the door of the aircraft. ""Maybe some passenger inadvertently knocked it off and it wasn't reattached,"" Faletau said. ""Perhaps that's how the incident happened."" Faletau said the water in the cabin was likely condensation from the aircraft's air conditioning system, caused in part by Tonga's intense humidity. He also defended safety certification processes required by various world aviation governing bodies, the Chinese aviation industry and Real Tonga. Tonga needs plane . Real Tonga began operations in March 2013. It's the latest in a string of airlines that have attempted to keep Tonga flying. ""The domestic air infrastructure has been a problem in Tonga for a number of years,"" Faletau said. ""We're a small nation, with only about 100,000 population. ""It's difficult to mount a sustainable airline operation for this market. The gift of the MA60 from the People's Republic of China to our government represents stability for Tonga's air infrastructure for the future.""","Australian passenger shaken by ""anxious"" flight on Chinese-made MA60 aircraft in Tonga .

"(CNN) -- Two men found floating in a giant cooler off the Australian coast say they want to stay in Australia and don't want to go home, immigration officials said Friday. The Australian Customs Service found the two men in the Torres Strait on January 17. The men will be transferred to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, where Australia has an immigration detention facility, a spokesman for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship told CNN. ""The men have both indicated they do not wish to return to their home country,"" said the spokesman, who asked not to be named. ""They will remain in detention on Christmas Island while immigration officials consider any claims to remain in Australia."" The spokesman declined to reveal the men's nationality or what claims they have made to remain. Australian media reports have said the men are from Myanmar. The Australian Customs Service spotted the two men January 17 floating in a giant red icebox, or cooler, in the Torres Strait, between the northeastern tip of Australia and Papua New Guinea, a Customs spokesman said. Customs agents had been on a routine mission to identify possible smugglers in the area at the time, the spokesman said. A picture taken by Australian Customs shows the men standing in the floating cooler and waving at authorities. The sides of the box are waist-high. After their rescue by helicopter, the two men spent several days in a hospital, an immigration spokesman said. They were then housed in detention while officials interviewed and processed them, the spokesman said. Australian media reports said the men spent 25 days afloat in the cooler, surviving only by drinking rainwater and eating regurgitated fish dropped by birds. Lee Hollingsworth of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds told CNN it was not uncommon for Asian fishermen to use birds such as cormorants to dive down and retrieve fish that are then regurgitated whole.","Two men found floating in a giant cooler off the Australian coast want to stay .

"(CNN) -- FIFA has vowed to act on revelations of worldwide match-fixing, but its top security official warns that the governing body will need help from outside football to eradicate the problem. Monday's report from Europol said that 380 matches across Europe had been fixed by an Asia-based crime syndicate, including World Cup and European Championship qualifiers as well as the continent's top club competitions. ""The cooperation between law enforcement and sporting organizations needs to be strengthened,"" FIFA's director of security Ralf Mutschke said in a statement. ""The support of law enforcement bodies, legal investigations, and ultimately tougher sanctions are required, as currently there is low risk and high gain potential for the fixers."" FIFA already works closely with Interpol, the worldwide police agency, while its European Union counterpart said there had so far been 50 people arrested in 15 countries in an investigation involving 425 match officials, club officials, players and criminals. It is estimated that â‚¬16 million ($21.7m) had been bet on matches by criminals, yielding an â‚¬8 million ($10.8m) profit, with the highest single bribe of â‚¬140,000 paid in Austria. ""Match-fixing and match manipulation is a global problem, and one that is not going to go away tomorrow,"" Mutschke said. ""FIFA and the football community are committed to tackling this problem, but we will not succeed alone."" Mutschke, a former Interpol director and German federal criminal police office manager, said governments need to take a tougher stance on people involved in match-fixing. ""In football, a national association can sanction a member of the football family if they are found guilty of contravening the legal, football framework,"" he said. ""FIFA's Disciplinary Code provides the opportunity to extend those sanctions, and impose a life ban. ""But for people outside of football, currently the custodial sentences imposed are too weak, and offer little to deter someone from getting involved in match-fixing. ""FIFA requests that law enforcement bodies continue their engagement, and continue to assist FIFA in the global fight against match-manipulation and organized criminals, even if the investigations are considered complex."" FIFA president Sepp Blatter has also recently called for greater government intervention in match-fixing cases. ""It is time for governments to introduce appropriate sanctions as a deterrent, for while a player may be prepared to risk a ban for throwing a match, he will most likely not wish to risk a prison sentence,"" he said on the FIFA website. ""We must lobby governments to introduce legislation of this kind, both nationally and across borders where possible, through countries reaching a common position on this problem."" Reports have claimed that one of the European matches in question was a UEFA Champions League match between English club Liverpool and Hungary's Debrecen. However, the Premier League side said Tuesday that it had not been contacted by the authorities about the 2009 match, and the English Football Association also denied any knowledge of fixing at that game. ""Liverpool Football Club has not been contacted by anyone from Europol or UEFA in relation to this matter,"" the five-time European champion told CNN. ""The FA is not aware of any credible reports into suspicious Champions League fixtures in England, nor has any information been shared with us,"" a spokesman told CNN. ""While the Champions League comes under UEFA jurisdiction, the FA, alongside the Premier League, Football League and Conference, monitor markets for the top seven leagues and three major cup competitions in England and take matters of integrity in football extremely seriously."" In 2010, UEFA banned Debrecen goalkeeper Vukasin Poleksic for two years for failing to report that he was approached to fix matches by a betting syndicate before a match against Fiorentina in October the previous year. The club confirmed that the Liverpool and Fiorentina matches were being investigated, but refused to comment further on the accusations. ""Neither DVSC or the player wants to react to this news. Everything on this matter has been dealt with in 2010,"" its website reported. Former FIFA security chief Chris Eaton told CNN World Sport that investigations need to be more proactive. ""This is very easy cash money for organized crime and I think governments should be worried about it,"" said the Australian, who now works for Qatar-based sports security consultancy ICSS. ""This is typical organized crime behavior: attract people, corrupt people and finally intimidate them. ""I think police have finally realized that this is organized crime and therefore they have an interest. Most of these investigations in Europe happened accidentally. They were investigating crime in other areas and came across this issue of match-fixing. ""There's been no determined effort to have preventative investigation, it's been retrospective. We need to find out who's involved and stop them -- in fact, to prevent them."" A former player who helped expose match-fixing in Italy in 2011 says clubs also need to take more responsibility. ""The management of the clubs have to act and support the players and support the authorities in their investigations,"" said Simon Farina, who now works as a community coach for English club Aston Villa. ""They cannot leave the players isolated and afraid to speak out when they are confronted by the wrong individuals,"" he told the Premier League team's website. Farina was recognized by Interpol after telling the authorities he had been offered a bribe to fix the outcome of an Italian Cup game in November 2011, and was later called up to Italy's national team as a reward. ""Working now with children, I understand completely how important it is to pass on the right values,"" he said.","World football's governing body calls on governments to help in battling match-fixing .

"(CNN) -- When temperatures start to dip to uncomfortable lows at night, there are always calls from charities to donate blankets and warm clothes for homeless people. Some iReporters came up with less predictable ways to help their fellow humans and make a creative impact in the lives of those less fortunate. Tina Hovsepian, for example, wondered if she could help the homeless with origami. She was exploring the principles of this ancient paper-folding art at the University of Southern California School of Architecture when she envisioned a way to provide a portable shelter for the people she saw at night sleeping out on the pavement. After working through many iterations of the design, Hovsepian developed an accordion-like shelter she calls ""Cardborigami."" Because of the origami design, the folding mechanism increases the sturdiness and structural integrity of the cardboard. This also allows it to be folded flat and easily carried by one person. Watch Tina unfold her ""Cardborigami,"" on CNN iReport . Hovsepian knows ""Cardborigami"" is not a permanent solution, but she hopes it can be a transition to something better. ""Sometimes people just need a moment out of the elements, a moment to rest and prepare for the next day."" ""It has been very inspiring, hearing from people around the world who are interested in my design,"" says Hovsepian, who is creating a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization to help get the folded homes on the streets. For guidance and motivation, Hovsepian turned to the team at ""Everyone Deserves a Roof,"" a pioneering nonprofit group that provides portable shelters for homeless people in Los Angeles, California. The group's EDAR, a four-wheel pushcart that transforms into a shelter, offers secure storage of belongings during the day. At night, it unfolds into a one-person raised tent, providing privacy and protection from the elements. iReporter Julie Yurth Himot, EDAR program coordinator, sees an added benefit to portable shelters. She said that although 140 EDARs are in use, with another 50 being manufactured, the greatest measure of the units' success is the fact that one has already been returned. One woman is no longer in need of the EDAR because she curbed her drug habit and moved into transitional housing. ""It was experiencing her own bed, her own place to stay,"" in the EDAR, said Himot, ""that made her remember the life she could have."" See photos of the EDAR in action, on CNN iReport . Spencer Aronfeld filed an iReport about helping homeless people with the law. He provides free legal services in Miami, Florida, shelters, with the organization Lawyers to the Rescue. He said there is a growing need for legal assistance with housing issues. ""There are more and more questions on foreclosures, property rights and mortgage law"" said Aronfeld, who said this now accounts for up to a quarter of the legal inquiries he receives at the shelters. Aronfeld said he helps many people still living in their foreclosed home. ""They are desperate, knowing that on any day they will be kicked out. Some of these people have already lost their home and just don't know where to go or what to do,"" Aronfeld said. He said if he can help keep the roof over just one family, it will take the strain off the homeless shelters, which are already overcrowded. Spencer with his legal team at the Camillus House, on CNN iReport . Neil Donovan, executive director for the National Coalition for the Homeless, is pleased to hear that individuals losing their homes are consulting lawyers. ""Many of these people were not entering into the conversations with lawyers or bankers about viable options other than foreclosure."" said Donovan, who has seen the added pressure the housing crisis has placed on the homeless population. ""This economy and the lack of employment have increased the number of homeless, and the second tier effect would be from foreclosures, which in turn is making rental property scarce."" Donovan said. He is concerned about those that find themselves without a place to stay. ""America's homeless shelter system is called the last safety net, and this net is beginning to fray.""

"(CNN) -- My earliest memory of ghost stories is borne in a rented cabin on Canandaigua Lake, in Upstate New York, where my family spent each summer. Our cabin was rumored to have been built on an Indian burial ground and haunted by spirits. To a young girl with a wild imagination such as mine, who wanted to be a writer at the age of 7 and who hauled around a blue plastic typewriter wherever she went, these stories made the cabin appealing, because I loved how brave I felt exploring the attic and basement, and more, the knowledge that my father was reading the paper in the next room, and that I could, at any point, race into his arms for a hug and have all my fears assuaged. On summer nights, my family sat around the radio and listened to a program that featured one ghost story each night. This is still my strongest childhood memory, the only time I recall the members of my family joined together, tied by the intimate chord. Ghost stories, ironically, made us feel closer to each other, if only for those few savored moments when we'd share a quilt and perhaps a hand to squeeze. Tell us your town's ghost stories . Ghost stories appear in most cultures. There is a Seneca Indian ghost story about a fire-eating monster with no body, only a head, who snaked through Indian villages at night looking for small children to eat. This story was told to keep children from staying out late at night. Perhaps this was the point, also, of the most famous ghost story of my generation: the story of Derek, the monster boy who lived in the woods -- our woods, and any other woods where a camp happened to be. If memory serves me, the story ended with a melted skull. Everyone knew Derek and that he traveled around. At camp, we sat around a blazing fire on cold nights, bundled in our sleeping bags, mashed as close as we could get them, and steeped in woolen long underwear, the cold ground underneath. Our mouths were ajar, all clamoring for the story, begging our counselors to tell it. ""Tell Derek, Tell Derek!"" we'd cry. It was a favorite because it was scary but predictable, something that life rarely is. No matter how many times we heard it, gripping each other's hands tightly, the anticipation of Derek thrilled us. We knew that after the story ended, we would race back to our cabins, high on a rare sort of predictable terror, coveting an adolescent thrill. There was anticipation, drama, a predictable climax and our wild screams as the world of Derek faded from memory, and we'd slip safely back into our bunks and tumble into closeness, our bodies falling onto each other, gripping each other's arms and legs for dear life. We found safety and solace on those nights, if only until the next year until we returned to camp, and beg, of course, to hear the story of Derek once again. To revel in the closeness he allowed us, borne from his tragic life in the woods. Perhaps this is what we love most about ghost stories. They offer us a sense of control over terror, something unattainable in real life. Perhaps this is why we hang on to them, why we tell them to our children and our grandchildren. When we evolve from listener to storyteller, we become elevated in our children's eyes as we remind them that yes, this is only a story as we watch the same reactions played out around the campfire and realize that though the faces have changed, the reactions are universal. Ghost stories fill us with fear and dread. But then they're over, and we return to our comfortable lives. They help us to bond, become a haven, ride the lost rush of adrenaline and create memories on starry nights with those we love. Find out the 20 scariest movies of all time . We retell ghost stories because we're rarely alone when we're listening or telling them. Stories of the dead and mutilated, it seems, will abate loneliness. Because there is no better feeling than tumbling into closeness after a good scare. For some of us, they are a journey to another place, and they allow us to exorcise the hidden demons and monsters in our own imaginations, to voice them, and maybe to overcome fears. Ghost stories give us perspective. They allow us to escape the everyday. Living the life of a zombie or existing like Derek in the lonely woods, those were REAL problems. Poor Derek, Jason and the rest of the lot, wandering the Earth, stuck in purgatory with an ax to grind, literally. Maybe our lives weren't so bad after all? Years ago, during my nomadic 20s, my sister and I went camping in the White Mountains, just the two of us, to try to repair our strained relationship. We made a fire and told the ghost story of Derek. And after, both of us -- independent, stubborn, strong women bent on finding ourselves -- ran screaming back into our tent and clung to each other for dear life until we fell asleep. Today, we swear there was something lurking outside our tent for the next hour. I have the scars to prove it. She dug her nails into my arm so deeply, she drew blood. Why do we love ghost stories? Because they're a temporary sort of terror. They allow us to return to our world, however imperfect, and ultimately they make us feel better about our lives. They send us snuggling into the arms of the person, just moments before, who was perhaps full of flaws, who now feels like our greatest protector. Ironically, ghost stories take us on a journey of terror that ultimately leaves us feeling safer and less lonely than we had felt before.","Author Ilie Ruby remembers the thrills of hearing ghost stories around campfires .

"Minneapolis, Minnesota (CNN) -- The Gulf Coast oil disaster. A massive hurricane.  The collapse of a highway overpass during rush hour. A terrorist attack. All of these calamities have happened in the United States in recent years.  And today, graduate students at the University of Minnesota are analyzing these disasters to learn how they can prepare for the next one -- or help prevent it. They are all working toward a master of science in security technology. It's sort of like a degree in all things Homeland Security. The new graduate program, which began last month, has attracted students from a variety of backgrounds.  Students attending the inaugural class include a U.S. Marine, a government IT guy, even a U.S. postal worker. They are studying high profile catastrophes from natural disasters like hurricanes and pandemic diseases to critical infrastructure failures and biological or explosive terrorist attacks. They also examine collapses in the banking industry, the postal service, electric power grids and food supply chains. The program is taught by Massoud Amin, a leading security expert and the director of the university's Technological Leadership Institute. After the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, Amin was tasked with assessing the security risk to the nation's electrical power grid.  He and his team reported their findings to the U.S. government. Amin said his passion for improving people's lives through technology began as a young boy in Iran. ""I went with my dad to villages to practice medicine ... where women would die in childbirth,"" Amin said.  ""And I would see that as soon as they got electricity, their lives would improve. ""Because of this experience, I kind of knew at that young age ... I wanted to use physics to improve the lives of others."" Three years ago, he got a close-up view of how physics can impact people's lives. Sitting in his office, he watched as the I-35 west bridge that crosses the Mississippi River in Minneapolis collapsed just a few yards away, killing 13 people. Amin said that tragedy helped spark the idea for the master's program. ""All these large scale critical systems that we take for granted ... how do we prevent systemic failure in them,"" he said.  ""If a disturbance occurs in one place, how do we identify precursors to disturbances before [disaster] happens?"" The biggest challenge his students face is coming up with a solution to preventing disasters without hindering civil liberties and privacy, Amin said. A large number of the students enrolled in the program are working professionals from industries where security and risk assessment play an important role. Nathan Hunstad, an information technology analyst for Minnesota's Democratic caucus, said security plays a ""pretty big part"" of his job. ""What we do here is political, so there's obviously a lot of need for secrecy and privacy,"" Hunstad said.  ""We're very cognizant of security issues."" Hunstad said he has been looking for a way to combine his interest in cryptology and code-breaking with his passion for public policy. ""Working for the Department of Homeland Security or continuing to work for the legislature in terms of setting broad security policies for the state or country ... that would probably be my dream job,"" he said. Student Bill Hagestad already has first-hand experience with securing critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks.

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton has started to re-enter the public spotlight, very possibly beginning a new stage of her career that may lead to the presidential election of 2016. In recent appearances, Clinton seems energized and spirited. She has already begun to talk about issues like women's rights and voting rights, causes that have animated her for decades. Gone is the constrained demeanor that turned off many potential supporters in previous years. The real Hillary Clinton seems to be emerging. Republicans are instantly attacking as might be expected. Former House speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, an arch nemesis of the Clintons in the 1990s, warned that she was promoting ""left-wing ideas"" that would lead to her defeat. Those kinds of attacks won't have the same weight as they did eight years ago. The former first lady, senator, and secretary of state is in excellent position to run the kind of campaign that is true to her history, in large part because of the impact that President Obama has had in the past six years. Democrats are more confident about throwing their support behind a candidate who stands proudly for the key tenets of the liberal tradition: a belief that government can help solve social problems in the United States. Unlike her husband, who felt in the early 1990s that he had to emphasize his centrist, new Democratic credentials, President Obama has opened the doors for a Democrat to build their campaigns on the tradition of the New Deal and Great Society, rather than running away from that legacy. How did President Obama make this happen? Most important, the president has been far more assertive in his willingness to use the federal government to address big domestic challenges than many Democrats who preceded him. The Affordable Care Act put into place a large series of regulations aimed at providing better and more accessible care for a health care system whose costs had spun out of control. The Dodd-Frank Act provided a regulatory framework to prevent the kind of risky behavior that led to the 2008 financial crash, and the economic stimulus provided government money to help get the economy moving again. Since his re-election in 2012, an important mark for Democrats that these kinds of policies don't result in inevitable defeat, Obama has also fought back against the austerity drives of the GOP, defending key government programs from the scalpel. After the Supreme Court weakened the Voting Rights Act, Obama vowed to protect the law and Attorney General Eric Holder announced that he would not allow states to violate rights. Though hesitant at first, President Obama has embraced the major social movement of our dayâ€”gay rightsâ€”taking a more progressive stand than any president before him. In short, President Obama has broken an important barrier for Clinton, or any other Democrat, by allowing members of his party to be proud of their ideals and challenging the notion that the only way for their party to win is to agree with the right. President Obama has also shifted the center of political debate by driving Republicans further to the right ever since the 2010 midterms. Tea party Republicans have placed immense pressure on the Republican leadership to take harder line stances on issues like the budget. Republicans moved so far to the right they have made liberal Democrats seem much more moderate. Liberal Democrats, who back in the 1990s could still be attacked as ""the far left"" can appear more ""reasonable"" to the mainstream when compared with conservative Republicans. The tea party has also opened the door to Clinton, as Obama discovered with Mitt Romney in 2012, to build a campaign that argues the GOP is too extreme to govern. In a very different way, President Obama has created a huge opportunity for Hillary Clinton because of his failures. Despite his accomplishments, he has failed to make progress on a number of important issues that Clinton can embrace as central to her platform, setting her up to be a leader who can complete and move beyond what President Obama has started. The most important is the economic insecurity of the middle class. The sluggish economic recovery and historically high rates of inequality, which Obama himself laments but has not been able to reverse, give Clinton a potent theme to run on. Gingrich might call such rhetoric left wing, but for millions of Americans it will strike the exact right chord. Clinton, who demonstrated her skill on the international stage, also has a chance to address some of the disappointments with President Obama's foreign policy. Many Democrats are watching the events in Egypt, deeply concerned that the unraveling of democracy will undermine the kinds of promises that Obama made about liberal internationalism and the ability of diplomacy to solve global problems without resort to war. Many Democrats are also unhappy with the ongoing revelations about how Obama continued with President Bush's war on terror programs, making them even more robust with extensive NSA surveillance and drone attacks. Unlike most of the Democrats who are considering entering into the campaign, Clinton now has an extensive record of experience on foreign policy that will bolster her credentials as she talks about what she would do to correct these problems. If she tackles these issues effectively, she could energize support from liberals in her party who previously dismissed her as the candidate of the status quo. Even if President Obama's approval ratings decline further, Clinton has an opportunity to win public support using the framework Obama put forward. Hillary Clinton now has an excellent chance to put together the kind of presidential campaign that was elusive in 2008, one that could very well give the nation its first female president. In the coming months she will have to decide whether she wants to take this step or to instead focus on her work as a global leader outside government. But the opportunity for her is there and Obama, who once was engaged with her in some of the most bitter fights that Democrats have seen among their own in many years, has changed the terms of the debate in ways that will greatly benefit her. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer .","Hillary Clinton speaking out more on liberal causes like voting rights .

"(CNN) -- Ferocious rain has caused heavy flooding in the Philippine capital and the surrounding region, killing at least seven people, driving tens of thousands of others from their homes and bringing life in many areas to a standstill. The national weather agency, Pagasa, issued a red alert for the Manila metropolitan area and nearby provinces on Tuesday morning, warning that ""severe flooding is expected."" The torrential monsoon rains, intensified by a tropical storm out over the ocean, had already caused significant disruption on Monday, forcing the closure of financial markets and government offices not involved in the emergency response. Those measures continued Tuesday as photos and videos showed flood waters reaching waist or chest deep on some roads in the Manila region. iReport: Flooding clogs streets of Manila . The water at several dams in the region is reaching a critical level, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said in a statement. The disaster council reported that seven people had so far died as a result of the rain and floods, most of them by drowning. The deaths occurred across various provinces on the main Philippine island of Luzon. More than 130,000 people have had to leave their homes and seek shelter with friends and relatives or in evacuation centers, the council said. The floods also prompted airlines to cancel flights and authorities to suspend school classes. Seventy percent of central Manila was flooded on Tuesday morning, the official Philippines News Agency reported, citing Johny Yu, officer in charge of the Manila Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. The pouring rain and rising water are grimly familiar to the Manila metropolitan region's 12 million residents, as August is generally the area's wettest month.

"(CNN) -- How much of a role do humans play in climate change? A new report scheduled to come out on Friday will give scientists' latest take on the topic. The United Nations report is expected to contain language that further identifies the role human activity is playing in increasing global temperatures through burning of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. The last report, in 2007, indicated that it was ""very likely"" that humans were responsible for most of the observed warming -- a judgment that corresponds to a confidence level greater than 90%. A draft that leaked in August raised that confidence level to ""extremely likely,"" or greater than 95% confidence that humans are responsible for the majority of global warming through carbon pollution. The impacts of this warming are already being seen through increases in extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts and extreme flooding events, which the assessment will highlight. The report will lay out projections for climate change through the end of the century, based upon four different carbon emission scenarios. Those range from a low end which would require significant cutbacks in emissions, to a worst-case scenario in which carbon emissions would continue to climb unabated. The projections will provide more details about sea-level rise, for which observations show rates increasing, and should give a more precise estimate of the levels we will see at the end of the century. Loss of sea ice will also be addressed, and the report will discuss the accelerating loss of sea ice in the Arctic and the slight increase of ice seen in the Antarctic. Hundreds of experts weigh in . The latest Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change brings together the latest research from top scientists around the field. It contains a ""summary for policymakers"" aimed at guiding politicians and lawmakers worldwide on decisions regarding the environment over the next several years. The U.N. panel releases a report every five or six years. Friday's report is the culmination of work by over 250 authors from 39 countries and was subject to an extensive review process involving more than 1,000 experts. More than 850 expert authors from 85 countries contributed research for the full report, which will be released in three stages through April. The first, on the physical science behind climate change, accompanies the summary for policymakers. The second, expected in March, will cover ""impacts and vulnerabilities"" of climate change; the third, on mitigation efforts, is set to go out in April. Bloomberg: Why Sandy forced cities to take lead on climate change . Climate change may increase violence, study shows . Critics of the report . Despite the overall breadth of the scientific expertise involved, and the extensive review and approval process, the IPCC Assessment Reports spark quite a few criticisms, from both climate change believers and skeptics. Skeptics claim the IPCC exists only to produce further evidence supporting the idea of man-made climate change while ignoring opposing research. But climate change activists, and many climate scientists, believe that the IPCC's consensus-seeking policy produces conclusions and estimates that are too conservative. Another often-cited critique of the report is that, due to its size and lengthy approval process, it is already outdated by the time it is released. Several important studies already have been published in the past year in the constantly evolving science of climate change that will not be included in this assessment. Despite the critics, this week's document will serve as a major measuring stick for the current state of the world's climate and what type of change is in store.

"Windsor, England (CNN) -- The remains of a swan have been found barbecued near Queen Elizabeth II's castle in Windsor, police said. By law, all unmarked mute swans in England and Wales belong to the queen. The swan had been killed and burned over the weekend, Thames Valley Police said. Its remains were found Sunday by a local council officer, who contacted police. The incident is being investigated as a theft, a police statement said. Anyone with information is urged to get in touch. Wendy Hermon, of the charity Swan Lifeline, told CNN of her disgust and puzzlement at the crime. ""It's an act of vandalism which shouldn't happen,"" she said. ""The most sickening thing about all this is the swans will go to people because they think they are going to feed them. ... I always say they are semidomestic because they trust us, so it's going into a trap."" The majestic white birds are a fairly common sight on the River Thames, which flows past Windsor and on to London. According to the official website of the British monarchy, all mute swans have belonged to the Crown since the 12th century, when they were regarded as a delicacy and eaten at banquets. ""Today, the Crown retains the right to ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water, but the queen only exercises her ownership on certain stretches of the Thames and its surrounding tributaries,"" it says. Each year, a census is carried out of the swans on stretches of the Thames in the counties of Middlesex, Surrey, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire, it says. This practice is known as swan upping. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne reported from Windsor, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Police say a swan was found killed and burned over the weekend .

"(CNN) -- A ring once owned by the 19th century novelist Jane Austen is to remain in Britain after a museum successfully raised funds to buy it from American singer Kelly Clarkson. The gold and turquoise ring is one of just three pieces of jewelry in existence known to have belonged to Austen, the author of novels including ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Emma."" Jane Austen's House Museum, in Chawton, southern England, said it had been unable to meet the sale price of Â£152,450 ($231,227) when the ring was auctioned by Sotheby's last year. Clarkson, a ""long time Austen devotee"" bought the item instead, it said. The sale price was more than five times the estimate Sotheby's had placed on the ring. In August, UK Culture Minister Ed Vaizey placed a temporary export bar on the ring ""on the grounds that it is so closely connected with [Britain's] history and national life that its departure would be a misfortune.""

"(CNN) -- After the attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi, Kenya, substantial attention was given to the some 40 Americans who have traveled to fight for Al-Shabaab in Somalia during the past several years. But much less attention has focused on Al-Shabaab's supporters in the United States who have helped to fund the terrorist group. Those supporters have funneled tens of thousands of dollars via money transfer businesses to the terrorist organization and have often maintained direct contact with Al-Shabaab leaders and fighters in Somalia. After the 9/11 attacks, when it became clear to investigators that al Qaeda's deadly assaults on New York and Washington had cost as much as $500,000 to mount, the U.S. government became far more aggressive about trying to block funds going to terrorist organizations. Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex attack . Part of that process involved a determined effort to sort through which groups were terrorist organizations. On 9/11 there were only 26 terrorist groups on the State Department's list of designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations. Today there are 51, among them Al-Shabaab, which was designated in March 2008. The result of that designation was that it was now illegal for a person in the United States to knowingly provide Al-Shabaab with money, training, expertise, false documentation, communications equipment, weapons or explosives, or to join the group. Opinion: Al-Shabaab is fighting for its survival . On that basis, a number of cases have emerged: . • In Rochester, Minnesota, two women from Somalia who had become naturalized U.S. citizens helped organize funding for Al-Shabaab. Hawo Hassan, a 64-year-old adult day care worker, and Amina Farah Ali, 35, set up a dedicated teleconference line to raise funds for Al-Shabaab. Hundreds of interested individuals called in to these teleconferences, and after each one Hassan and Ali recorded pledges of funds from the callers. After a teleconference on October 26, 2008, the two women received pledges from 21 individuals totaling $2,100 in funds for Al-Shabaab. These teleconferences often featured Al-Shabaab figures. In one teleconference, an Al-Shabaab female leader exhorted the listening audience to send funds. In another, Mahad Karate, the head of Al-Shabaab's intelligence wing, told the members of the listening audience that jihad ""is waged financially"" and that their help was needed. The two female Al-Shabaab fund-raisers also went door to door in Minnesota to raise contributions, often under false pretenses claiming contributions were for war orphans in Somalia. During a phone call with her Al-Shabaab financial contact, Ali stated, ""I tell the people to collect money in the name of the poor. Nobody is aware of the money I send to you."" Prosecutors said it was clear from the phone conversations that they monitored that the two women knew that they were raising money for Al-Shabaab, a group that had been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. Both women were convicted of providing funds to Al-Shabaab and were sentenced to lengthy prison terms this year. Opinion: Al-Shabaab's American allies . • Similarly, Ahmed Hussein Mahamud, a 27-year-old man, raised money from the Minnesota Somali community under the pretense that the money was going to a local mosque or to help orphans in Somalia. Instead he transferred the funds to fellow conspirators who had traveled from Minnesota to fight in Somalia to help them buy weapons. He and his co-conspirators transferred $1,500 to help Al-Shabaab. Mahamud pleaded guilty last year. • Nima Ali Yusuf, a 25-year-old San Diego woman, who pleaded guilty in December 2011 to sending $1,450 to help fund Al-Shabaab, was in telephone contact with some of the Somali-American men fighting in Somalia for Al-Shabaab. • In 2007, Aden Hashi Ayrow, a Al-Shabaab leader, contacted Basaaly Saeed Moalin, a cabdriver in San Diego, asking him to fund his group. In January 2008, Ayrow told Moalin that he needed to know how much money was being sent monthly to his group, even if it was only $100, because even relatively small amounts of money could make a big difference in Somalia, which is one of the poorest countries in the world. To keep an Al-Shabaab foot soldier in the field only cost a dollar a day. At Ayrow's request, Moalin organized other members of the Somali-American community to help provide funding. Moalin recruited three others members of the Somali-American community and together they sent $8,500 to Al-Shabaab between 2007 and 2008. All four were later convicted of providing support to Al-Shabaab. • Another Al-Shabaab supporter in St Louis, cabdriver Mohamud Abdi Yusuf, was part of a group of men that sent $21,000 to Kenya and Somalia for Al-Shabaab. Yusuf pleaded guilty to giving support to the terrorist group. Opinion: Al-Shabaab 'Lord of the Flies' with guns . Since Al-Shabaab was designated as a terrorist organization, the U.S. Justice Department has mounted ""Operation Rhino"" to combat Al-Shabaab's support network in the States and has convicted 12 individuals for providing funds to Al-Shabaab, according to a count by the New America Foundation. This seems to have had a real deterrent effect. As a result of the publicity these cases have had in the Somali-American community, indictments for Al-Shabaab fund-raising have slowed considerably. And the last time a Somali-American was indicted for raising money for Al-Shabaab was 2011.","Bergen: Al-Shabaab bolstered not only by U.S. recruits but also by U.S. financial backers .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Their faces stare from old photos, their voices silent since Super Typhoon Haiyan swept through Tacloban in the Philippines on Friday. At first Daisy Nemeth wasn't worried. Her family was close, they kept in touch. Soon, no doubt, she'd hear from her home in Hong Kong that all were safe. But three days later, that call hasn't come. Around 30 family members are missing. ""It's my uncle, my mom's brother is missing. All his children, his wife, everyone. My cousin is missing with her six children, they range in age from 9 to 19. Then I have many, many other missing cousins. But these are the ones we're the closest with -- and they're nowhere to be found,"" Nemeth said. READ MORE: Survivors face grim struggle . She'd be there in a heartbeat to look for them herself, she said, but at six months' pregnant and a mother to twin toddlers, there's no way she can go, even if she could find a way in. Instead, her family, some of whom are based in Denmark, has been trying to hire someone to go to Tacloban to search for them, but no one seems to want to go. ""If no one can or is even willing to do it, I can't even begin to imagine the situation there,"" she said. ""In the Philippines you can buy anything and anyone. I hate to say it but that's the truth. So if we can't even pay someone to go in and look for them..."" Nemeth said, her voice trailing off. READ MORE: 'We just can't keep going' Nemeth's uncle, Rogelio Tan, is 68 years old and suffers from a severe learning disability. She's concerned for his safety if he's left to fend for himself. She says her uncle doesn't always make the most sensible decisions, and fears what could happen ""if he doesn't have his children with him to make good decisions for him."" Nemeth is checking Facebook pages where lists have been posted of survivors found in medical centers, and others are posting photos of lost family members in the hope that someone's seen them. One of the largest is ""Tacloban (and nearby Waray Towns) Yolanda Update"" where more than 17,000 users are swapping messages in a mixture of English and the local language, Tagalog. Among the pleas for help are stories of survival. ""THANK YOU LORD JESUS CHRIST... just got a call from our mother and they are all complete and safe... they survived by drinking only water in our deep wheel without foods in 4 days... they walked 6 hours to reach the Tacloban City Hall just to be able to contact us.. they are now going to the airport to take the C130 to Cebu with my relatives,"" writes William Sherwin Ay-Ay. Nemeth is hoping for a similar tale of survival but so far has seen nothing that has offered anything beyond graver fears that her family has disappeared without a trace. ""I've seen all the pictures and I'm scouring the pictures but I can't even recognize the neighborhoods,"" she said. ""According to some Facebook groups, the area my uncle was in, it isn't even there any more."" And so the family's search goes on. iReport: Looking for loved ones .

"(CNN) -- This isn't the idealism of ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" It isn't as dark as ""House of Cards,"" either. So how about settling on something lighter, like say, ""Animal House,"" in which the dean famously says, ""The time has come for someone to put his foot down. And that foot is me."" And so it goes with Sen. Ted Cruz, at least when it comes to killing Obamacare. The first-term GOP Texan is the self-appointed executioner of a law Republicans despise. But truth be told, it's hard to figure out exactly what Cruz's faux filibuster on the Senate floor this week was really about. He's against big, bad Obamacare, we get it. Only he was asking Senate Republicans to vote against something that would actually kill Obamacare. Huh? Nevermind. None of this has been about reality. Rather, it's about cementing a new definition of leadership: Positioning yourself as the spokesman for your political base by telling it exactly what it wants to hear. In Cruz's case, it's the tea party base. Lucky for him, there's a made-for-TV bully pulpit, plenty of time to talk and the talking points are easy and oh, so, predictable. Main Street fed up over Beltway shutdown battle . Consider this sound bite extraordinaire: ""This is a fight to restore freedom to the people,"" says Cruz, clearly not inhibited by any lack of self-importance. ""This is a fight to get the Washington establishment, the empire, to listen to the people."" Not exactly Abraham Lincoln, but it's a whammy of a bite. In it, Cruz gets to cuddle the tea party while taking on the evil establishment — and by that he means the awful folks in his own party who would not shut down the government over a doomed move to kill Obamacare. Imagine that: Republicans refusing to catapult a man they don't like into the presidential arena. Maybe they're part of Cruz's evil establishment, but if they are, they're trying to save him — and the party — from itself on the issue of shutting down the government. Cruz is thinking 2016, but they're thinking about the repercussions for the GOP if the government shuts down. While some polls show that two-thirds of tea party sympathizers are just fine with a shutdown over health care reform, a majority of independent voters are not. And last time I checked, those are the folks whom the GOP needs to win over if its going to win the White House. But I digress. Right now, Cruz has divided the Republican Party in a Palinesque way, only worse because he is an actual senator with actual authority who could have an actual presidential candidacy. ""We have been beaten up by his so-called grassroots movement back home. They pound us with ads, we hear about what he wants at town halls. We don't like Obamacare, either. But there's another way to go about this,"" says a senior House Republican. ""He [Cruz] won one primary in a red state in a Republican year, and now he's busy running for president."" Oh, and by the way, he adds, ""he's all about raising money. And doing it at our expense."" Why is it at the GOP's expense? Because Republicans are now afraid of being challenged from the right in primaries. They're not worried about their Democratic opponents; they're worried about the opponents on their right whom, many believe, Cruz would support and throw them under the bus. They're against Obamacare, but are they against it enough? ""He's a demagogue-and-a-half,"" complains the House Republican. ""This is not what you do to your teammates."" Ah, but that's the crux of it all: Cruz doesn't need a team. He's got the floor to himself. And he's got the people, right? That is, until he doesn't. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Sen. Ted Cruz spent more than 21 hours arguing against funding for Obamacare .

"(CNN) -- It can be quite expensive to adopt a child in the United States. CNN Hero Becky Fawcett and her husband, Kipp, paid about $40,000 when they adopted their first child, Jake, in 2005. Knowing how many others wouldn't be able to afford such a steep price, Fawcett created Helpusadopt.org, which provides families with grants ranging from $500 to $15,000. Fawcett, who also adopted her daughter, 18-month-old Brooke, recently spoke with CNN's Allie Torgan about her experiences and how they led her to help other adoptive families. Allie Torgan: When did you get the idea for Helpusadopt.org? Becky Fawcett: We were sitting in our lawyer's office. You're given an approximate total (of the adoption cost), and you have to sign it so you know how much this could possibly be. For some reason -- and I will never know why I did it -- I looked at our lawyer and I said: ""We have the money to pay you. But I need to know if I didn't, what happens to me now? What happens at this point to people who can't afford this?"" Our lawyer had two choices when I asked this question. And it's so important the decision he made. He could have said, ""I don't know."" But he decided to give us the God's honest truth. He said, ""Unfortunately, I've heard of people living a childless life."" And that was my moment I fell apart. I sat there and thought, if my life had been slightly different ... and I was told that I was not going to be a mother because I couldn't afford adoption, I don't even know what I would have done. I don't know who I would have turned to for help. I don't know what that would have meant for my marriage. It just hit me: I knew how lucky we were. Had this whole conversation not happened, Helpusadopt.org would not exist. Fawcett explains why her children's birth mothers are her heroes . Torgan: How did your initial plan for Helpusadopt.org come to fruition? Fawcett: We wanted to support everybody. We wanted to help people adopt on their terms. There would be absolutely no application fee. We wanted to give sizable grants that would be life-changing. We crafted very carefully a ""friends and family"" letter. We educated them (about) the cost of adoption, because no one fathoms this. It was just an instantaneous decision on people's part to climb on board. We never asked for a penny. It just came in. Torgan: Who have you helped? Fawcett: We've helped LGBT families. We've helped single women. We've helped a single man. We've helped heterosexual married couples. We've helped people adopt special-needs children, both (from) here in the United States and from abroad. We've helped foster-care adoptions. Our families are amazing. I think sometimes they're shocked to hear from me, because we do want to hear what's going on after the fact. We don't give you the grant money and disappear. We consider these people part of our family. We ask for baby pictures. We ask for updates. This is a labor of love. Torgan: What is your hope for the future of Helpusadopt.org? Fawcett: The problem of people being able to afford adoption and build their families is not a solvable one as I see it. I wish that I could be the brilliant woman who wakes up one day and says I got it all figured out. But I don't see a foreseeable answer to this. Helpusadopt.org solves part of the problem. We're helping people bring their children home and we're helping all types of families, which is the most important part of what we do.

"(CNN) -- Nicholas Wiseman struggles with asthma and migraines. He has for years. His Malibu family has done everything they can to help -- they've torn out the shrubs by his house, thinking he may be allergic to them. They've ripped out a wall, thinking there might be mold there. But still the high school junior doesn't feel good. ""I thought it was the seasons, like the weather changing,"" Wiseman said. Now his family believes there may be something else to blame: his school. A group of Wiseman's teachers at Malibu High School sent a letter to the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District's risk manager on October 4, complaining about a variety of illnesses. They suspect their working environment is at fault, but administrators say they are still investigating, and some experts are skeptical. ""At this point, there is nothing to let people know, other than employees had health concerns,"" Sandra Lyon, the district superintendent, told CNN Newsource affiliate KCAL/KCBS. ""We don't have any evidence whatsoever that there is any contaminant, any issue in or around that building."" The letter says the teachers ""are extremely concerned about their health and safety."" Three teachers at the school have been diagnosed with stage 1 thyroid cancer in the past six months. Some seven teachers complained about migraines. The letter says the teachers who are sick work primarily in the main middle school building (the school services grades 6 through 12), the music and drama building, the visual arts building and in the school's theater. When one teacher moved to another building, her migraines got better, the letter states. Another teacher who moved from one of the suspected buildings stopped getting a rash she'd been suffering from for four years. The letter publicly requests environmental tests be done at the school and asks the district to make those test results public. ""Skepticism is totally an appropriate way to approach this,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, who is not involved in the investigation. The teachers' letter characterizes the number of teachers being diagnosed with the same type of cancer as ""alarming,"" but Brawley said thyroid cancer is unfortunately ""incredibly common."" Overall in the United States there has been an increased rate of thyroid cancer since 1973. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention theorizes that the increasing rates simply reflect that the disease has gotten easier to detect. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 60,220 new cases of thyroid cancer diagnosed in 2013. Women between the age of 35 and 65 are at highest risk. Scientists believe most cases of thyroid cancer are hereditary. ""The only instances where we have ever seen a man-made thyroid cancer from exposure (to environmental chemicals) is someone exposed to a high dose of iodine. And it takes years to develop thyroid cancer from it,"" Brawley said. Even if for some reason radioactive iodine were found in these school buildings, the chemical only has a half-life of 42 days, meaning it would disappear after that. Then the danger would be gone. ""Very few people will develop a cancer immediately after an exposure,"" Brawley said. ""Now if they were exposed to something in the late '80s or early '90s, then maybe there would be something."" Cancer clusters are also uncommon, according to scientific research. A well-respected study from Dr. Michael Than that published in A Cancer Journal for Clinicians found that of all the cases of alleged clusters, only 5% to 15% actually were cancer clusters. The CDC defines a cancer cluster as a ""greater-than-expected number of cancer cases that occurs within a group of people in a geographic area over a period of time."" While environmentally-derived thyroid cancers are rare, what is much more common are health issues caused by mold. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Toxic Schools . Some studies estimate a third or more of U.S. schools have mold, dust or other indoor air problems that are serious enough to cause serious respiratory illnesses such as asthma. Only about 20% to 30% of the population is actually susceptible to indoor air problems like mold or dust, but for those who are, the symptoms get increasingly severe. Legally there are no indoor air quality standards for schools. Yet a national survey of school nurses found that 40% knew children and staff who were adversely affected by indoor pollutants at their school. One school in Fairfield, Connecticut, had such a bad mold problem the district tore it down in 2000, but not before one of its teachers, Joellen Lawson, became permanently disabled with a serious lung condition called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. She had to leave teaching after being in a classroom for 23 years. Are schools making us sick? As a precaution, Malibu High has brought in an environmental firm to run tests on the buildings and the surrounding soil. The district has closed a building and relocated students. ""We want to be diligent and overly cautious just to make sure there isn't anything here, but we don't want to panic,"" principal Jerry Block told CNN Newsource affiliate KCAL/KCBS. The news, though, is still unsettling to parents. The school brought them in for an informational session about the issue on Tuesday. Cassandra Wiseman, whose son has been so sick with asthma and migraines, is upset. ""It's appalling. You think you are doing the right thing then you're suddenly, you have this total self-doubt that you're not at all,"" Wiseman said. Asked what she will do next if her son's health problems continue, Wiseman concluded, ""I don't know what to do. I'm just a mother.""","3 teachers at Malibu High School have been diagnosed with thyroid cancer in last 6 months .

"(CNN) -- Thai villagers close to the disputed Preah Vihear temple began returning to their homes Tuesday following a decision in the International Court of Justice -- the UN's highest court -- that awarded sovereignty over most of the land around the temple to Cambodia. Residents displaced by simmering tensions began returning to the border region, convinced the ICJ verdict will restore peace, according to Thailand's The Nation newspaper. A panel of judges ruled on Monday that the promontory on which the temple sits was part of Cambodia, although the court did not give Cambodia full control over all the territory saying it had no jurisdiction over a nearby hill -- known as Pheu Makhua - that formed part of the dispute. ""In consequence, Thailand was under an obligation to withdraw from that territory the Thai military or police forces or other guards or keepers that were stationed there,"" president of the International Court of Justice Peter Tomka said in the judgement. In a televised address, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said that Thailand would hold talks with Cambodia to finally resolve the 51-year-old dispute. ''Thailand will enter negotiations with Cambodia to put an end to the issue,'' she said in a nationally televised press conference. ""I would like all Thais to be confident that the government will be at its best in protecting national interests."" The Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen called for calm ahead of the court decision this week, saying that Thailand and Cambodia intended to abide by the court's decision. ""I would appeal to the armed forces fulfilling their duties in the border area to maintain calmness, patience and avoid actions that would cause tension or eventual clashes,"" he said in a statement. The 11th century Hindu temple sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. The two countries differ on whether some territory around the temple forms part of Thailand or Cambodia. The Hague-based International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962. Thailand claims, however, that the 1.8 square mile (4.6 sq. km) area around it was never fully demarcated. Thailand says the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia - a map that places the temple and surrounding area in Cambodian territory. In 2008, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- a place the U.N. says has outstanding universal value. The decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple. Both sides agreed to withdraw troops from the disputed area in December 2011 following border skirmishes earlier that year that left five people dead. As many as 27,000 people were displaced by the fighting. One Thai nationalist group, the Thai Patriotic Network, has said it would reject any judgment from the ICJ, according to The Nation newspaper. ""Thai people who know the reality would not allow the government to comply with the ICJ judgement. What the government has done could be deemed as 'selling the nation' to foreigners,"" Chaiwat Sinsuwong, leader of Thai Patriotic Network, told The Nation.","Villagers near the disputed temple begin returning to their homes .

"Kennesaw, Georgia (CNN) -- Chrissy Gibson makes no apologies for her support. Sure, she is upset her friends who work for the federal government have been furloughed. And yes, she dislikes that her family's favorite hiking spot at one of Georgia's premier national parks has been closed by the budget battle. But she stands by U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, one of the approximately 40 tea party and conservative Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives considered the architects of the government shutdown aimed at dismantling or defunding the Affordable Care Act, also referred to as Obamacare. For many, Gingrey and these other lawmakers are responsible for furloughing hundreds of thousands of federal workers, closing national parks and monuments and shuttering federal research. But for many of those in their districts -- people like Gibson and her family -- these representatives are soldiers in a battle of principle, standing up to an out-of-control government. ""He's standing up for what he believes, and somebody has to do that,"" said Gibson, 37. With the government shutdown that began October 1 in its second week, there was little question the country was beginning to feel the financial squeeze. A CNN/ORC International survey released this week found that although slightly more people were angry at Republicans than Democrats or President Barack Obama for the shutdown, both sides were taking a hit. According to the poll conducted over the weekend, 63% of respondents said they were angry at the Republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown, while 57% expressed anger at Democrats and 53% at Obama. ""It looks like there is more than enough blame to go around, and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Pentagon strikes deal with charity to pay military death benefits . 'What my district wants' But the national anger is unlikely to change the position of these conservative Republicans. Just ask Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who was elected to Congress in 2012. He told reporters that his support for the shutdown was simple: ""All that really matters is what my district wants. And my district is overwhelmingly in favor of my position."" Or ask Rep. Mark Meadows, who represents the western part of North Carolina. ""My job first is to make sure I represent the people back home,"" Meadows told CNN recently. ""I don't believe that when I get here that people expect me to look at the political implications. That's for somebody else to focus on."" Gingrey has been a frontrunner among those in Congress working to overturn Obama's signature health care law that passed in 2010 when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. ""A majority of Americans think Obamacare will make health care in our country worse, and they're right,"" the 71-year-old Gingrey said recently. His stance against the Affordable Care Act has earned him an enormous amount of support among his constituents in Georgia's 11th Congressional District, which covers the northwest suburbs of Atlanta. Nowhere is the government shutdown more on display in Gingrey's district than in Kennesaw, a city of about 30,000 that is home to federal employees and military personnel from nearby Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta. It's also apparent at the popular Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, where black metal gates have been chained. A sign posted on the gates announces the park's closure, citing the government shutdown. 5 crazy side effects from the shutdown . Closing 'the mountain' Among locals, it's simply known as ""the mountain,"" a place where outdoor enthusiasts come by the thousands to use the dog-friendly park's miles and miles of hiking and walking trails. Standing outside the gate, Janet Kamautz, 36, looked toward the nearly empty park where a handful of people entered using pedestrian walkways. ""I applaud him for what he's doing,"" she said of Gingrey's stance. The 36-year-old homemaker from Kennesaw said she knows the spending bill stalled in Congress has nothing to do with Affordable Care Act. But there needs to be a conversation about it, Kamautz said. ""It can't be one-sided. Right now, it's (Obama's) way or no way,"" she said. Kamautz pointed to the park, saying its closure was a scare tactic. ""Why would you close a park?"" she said. ""... It's a big thing that says the government shut down."" Of the 32 families in Gibson's neighborhood, she knows of a number -- all federal workers -- hit by the government shutdown. Turning to her 10-year-old son, Ty, Gibson asks: ""How many of your friends' dads are home right now?"" Ty counts on his fingers: One. Two. Three. Maybe four. Gibson knows another five or six people, mostly friends, who have been classified as ""non-essential"" federal employees. They have been furloughed, she said. ""I'm not happy about it. My friends are out of work, and I hate that this is happening to them,"" she said. The Gibsons expect their small telecommunications business will take a hit as a result of the government shutdown. ""When people don't get paid, they can't pay their long-distance bill. So, yeah, we are going to feel it if this goes on,"" Gibson said. But the Gibsons also expect to feel a financial pinch with the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Today, she said, she pays $16,000 a year to cover her family, including her husband and three children. The family doesn't expect to get a financial break with the new insurance requirements. In fact, Gibson said, her family expects to pay more. Gingrey, Gibson said, is fighting on behalf of her family. ""Yes, I'll vote for him again,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Brad Keselowski is once again a contender in this year's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, but off the track he is championing a cause dear to his heart. Keselowski, known for hanging an American flag out his window whenever a victory lap is warranted, started the Checkered Flag Foundation to support anyone who has ""sacrificed greatly for America."" The foundation centers around the Race 2 Recovery program, which serves wounded veterans. Several race weekends a year Keselowski and his foundation, run by former Navy Lt. Andrea Ross, work with local Veterans Affairs hospitals to bring vets and their families to the track for a VIP experience. Hospital staff recommends the honorees -- many amputees or in wheelchairs -- as either deserving of special praise or being in need of a morale boost. ""A lot of our honorees haven't been out of the house in quite some time. So it's a great way to get them out and get them on their feet,"" Keselowski says. The highlight of the program happens after the race's final lap. When the grandstands empty out and race crews have headed home, Keselowski gets back behind the wheel for an extra day to give his honorees a once-in-a-lifetime experience -- a high-speed joy ride around the track. ""I believe in charity in action. I think it's very tempting for some people to maybe write a check and walk away feeling like they've done their good deed, but at some point somebody actually has to do the good deed,"" Keselowski says. He gets help from his Penske Racing teammate Parker Kligerman. Kligerman drives a second car for honorees' family members who also might feel the need for speed. ""I hope they take a glimpse of what we do but almost at the same time a glimpse of getting away from some tumultuous experience they've had as a veteran of war,"" Kligerman says. ""And hopefully racing is something that they can become a fan of through this experience and have something to look forward to week in and week out."" Iraq war veteran Noah Galloway, who wasn't a NASCAR fan before the Birmingham VA connected him to the Checkered Flag Foundation, says Keselowski's program means a lot to him. ""I think what the Checkered Flag Foundation is doing is incredible -- Brad having this organization, inviting veterans out to experience NASCAR events, but not only that. Here it is, Monday. He won yesterday's race. He was here this morning with us and driving us around the track,"" Galloway says. ""He could want to just as easily either still be partying or be back on the road. But he's here with us, and I think that is incredible for all of us veterans to have someone show that much appreciation."" One of the foundation's original honorees, Dustin Humphreys, says what Keselowski and his team did for him was so inspiring that he now gives back as a volunteer. ""It's changed my whole outlook on everything now. It's so easy to get depressed when you come back and you can't do the stuff you used to,"" Humphreys says. Like many of the men and women the foundation serves, Humphreys and Galloway are around the same age as Keselowski, a fact not lost on the 28-year-old racer. Keselowski says he realizes he could have just as easily been in their place. The cause became even more personal when he saw an old friend at Walter Reed Army Medical Center during NASCAR's tour to support the troops. His friend had been injured, and several soldiers in his unit had died in Iraq. ""He just completely lacked any motivation to live,"" Keselowski says of his friend with whom he'd lost touch. ""That was probably one of the key moments that made me feel like ... this was a cause that was worth something, to help guys like him get back going."" Keselowski adds, ""If we can be the difference in one person's life and prevent them from going through the trials and tribulations that a lot of our veterans have, whether it's becoming a recluse or worst case, suicide, if we can prevent one of those things from happening, I feel like we've been a success, and it's worth the effort.""","NASCAR driver Brad Keselowski's foundation helps those who have served the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Scientists in Colombia have unearthed the remains of a true prehistoric monster believed to be the biggest snake ever to have lived on Earth. An artist's impression of what Titanoboa cerrejonensis would have looked like. Named Titanoboa cerrejonensis, the snake would have weighed 1,140 kilograms (2,500 pounds) and measured 13 meters (42.7 feet) nose to tail tip -- dwarfing the largest modern pythons and anacondas which can grow to 6 meters (19.5 feet). Scientists believe it slithered around the planet between 58 and 60 million years ago. Geologist David Polly, who identified the position of the fossil vertebrae which made a size estimate possible, said in a statement Wednesday: ""At its greatest width, the snake would have come up to about your hips. The size is pretty amazing. ""But our team went a step further and asked, how warm would the Earth have to be to support a body of this size?"" Titanoboa's fossilized remains were discovered at a coal mine in the tropical Cerrejon region of northern Colombia by an international team of scientists. ""Truly enormous snakes really spark people's imagination, but reality has exceeded the fantasies of Hollywood,"" paleontologist Jonathan Bloch, who co-led the expedition, told reporters. ""The snake that tried to eat Jennifer Lopez in the movie 'Anaconda' was not as big as the one we found."" Based on the snake's size, the team was able to calculate that the mean annual temperature in equatorial South America 60 million years ago would have been about 91 degrees Fahrenheit, about 10 degrees warmer than today, Bloch said. ""Tropical ecosystems of South America were surprisingly different 60 million years ago,"" said Bloch. ""It was a rainforest, like today, but it was even hotter and the cold-blooded reptiles were all substantially larger. ""The result was, among other things, the largest snakes the world has ever seen...and hopefully ever will."" According to Nature.com, snakes are poikilotherms (cold-blooded) that, unlike humans, need heat from their environment to power their metabolism. Therefore research suggests that at the time the region would have had to be no less than 86 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit for the snake to have survived. Most large snakes today live in the tropical regions of South America and south-east Asia, where the high temperatures allow them to grow to impressive sizes. Meanwhile, Carlos Jaramillo -- who was also part of the expedition -- said the tropical rainforest at Cerrejon appeared to have thrived at these temperatures. ""This data challenges the view that tropical vegetation lives near its climatic optimum, and it has profound implications in understanding the effect of current global warming on tropical plants,"" he said.","Snake weighed 1,140 kgs (2,500 pounds), measured 13 meters (42.7 feet)

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Camille Grammer accuses her ex-boyfriend of leaving her bruised and battered from a fight while she was recovering from cancer surgery. A judge granted the ex-wife of actor Kelsey Grammer a temporary restraining order Tuesday that says Dimitri Charalambopoulos must stay at least 100 yards away from her. CNN has been unable to reach Charalambopoulos for a response. Court documents filed by Grammer -- a former ""Real Housewife of Beverly Hills"" cast member -- describe in dramatic detail an early morning fight with Charalambopoulos in a Houston, Texas, hotel where she was recovering from surgery two weeks ago. ""I wake up at least twice per night with visions of his face as he was attacking me,"" Grammer said in her filing. ""I continue to fear for my safety and for the safety of my children, who had grown to trust Mr. Charalambopoulos during the course of my relationship with him."" Grammer, 45, began dating Charalambopoulos, a 36-year-old fitness trainer from Texas, more than two years ago, according to court papers. Her divorce from Kelsey Grammer was finalized in February 2011. The argument began at 1:30 a.m. on October 16 when she was awakened by the vibration of Charalambopoulos' cell phone ""with incoming text messages and phone calls from another woman,"" Grammer said. ""Inquiry escalated to argument, and Mr. Charalambopoulos became verbally abusive to me, shouting expletives and insulting me with misogynic epithets,"" she said. ""He grabbed me by the hair, twisted it around his hand, and repeatedly pulled my head into the bed and its headboard. In so doing, Mr. Charalambopoulos succeeded in pulling out swaths of my hair and gave me a large, painful contusion on the side of my head."" When Grammer began screaming for help, ""Charalambopoulos squeezed my nose between his fingers and pushed upward forcefully, meanwhile covering my mouth in an attempt to silence me and to prevent me from breathing,"" she said. ""I experienced great pain in my nose and became afraid for my life as a consequence."" The attack continued for another 40 minutes to an hour, she said. ""I begged him to stop and threatened to call police,"" she said. ""He wrestled me on the hotel bed, repeatedly slamming my head and face into the furniture, and eventually he succeeded in completely immobilizing me."" Sitting on top of her -- with his knees ""mere inches from the area that had been the object my invasive surgery only a few days before"" -- Charalambopoulos put his fist in her face and told her, ""I wanna smash your head in,"" and ""I'll give you a reason to call the cops,"" Grammer said in her sworn statement. Before leaving her hotel room, he smashed her iPhone and unplugged and disassembled the hotel phones, she said. ""He told me I was going to hell, and then, to make his escape, he said he would 'knock (me) out' if I moved from the bed while he left the hotel,"" Grammer said. Three minutes after he walked out, Grammer ""hobbled down"" four flights of stairs to the hotel lobby where an employee called police, she said. A Houston police spokesman said no charges have been filed, but the incident is still under investigation. He noted that ""they broke each other's cell phones"" and her injuries were minor. Grammer's request for the restraining order included photographs of bruises on her wrists and face, her broken cell phone and a clump of her hair. A hearing to decide whether the temporary order will be made permanent is set for November 19 at the Santa Monica branch of the Los Angeles County Superior Court. CNN's Oscar Merino and Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","Fight started with ""text messages and phone calls from another woman,"" Grammer says .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- The discovery of the body of a woman in a stairwell of San Francisco General Hospital weeks after she was reported missing from her room requires ""a thorough, independent review,"" the mayor said Thursday. The review will examine ""top to bottom"" the hospital's security and its systems controls as well as reporting procedures when a patient goes missing, Mayor Ed Lee said. The announcement follows news this week that an engineering worker found the body of 57-year-old Lynne Spalding, who was reported missing on September 21, in the stairwell. ""It should have never happened, and on that we all agree,"" Lee said. ""... I told the family, I wish to have all of the answers just as they do."" The review is expected to begin this week, he said. Authorities have not released details about how Spalding died. She was admitted to the hospital on September 19 for a bladder infection. Her condition was improving when she disappeared two days later, according to the joint statement released this week by the hospital and sheriff's department. ""She was in fair condition when she left her hospital room shortly after being checked on by a nurse at 10:15 a.m. Fifteen minutes later, the nurse checked on her again, and upon finding her room empty, initiated a search of the hospital,"" the statement said. Thirty minutes later after she disappeared, two of her friends and her boyfriend arrived at the hospital to visit, David Perry, a Spalding family spokesman. They were told that Spalding had been missing for 30 minutes, he said. Hospital officials and police say they are investigating. The hospital says it has no idea how the body ended up in the rarely-used staircase. According to the joint statement, when Spalding was not found, the hospital staff notified the family and sheriff's department officials on site. Deputies searched the campus, and did not find her. Spalding's body was found Tuesday in the stairwell by a member of the hospital's engineering staff who was conducting a routine quarterly check, according to the statement. ""The exterior stairwell is a fire exit that is not routinely used by staff, patients or the public. It is alarmed and locks from the outside; it exits to the hospital grounds at the bottom,"" it said. Chelsea J. Carter wrote and reported from Atlanta, and Dan Simon reported from San Francisco.

"(CNN) -- Last fall, you could typically find my mom teaching, mentoring her students, nagging me to study for the SATs, taking my sister to soccer practice or cooking dinner. She took on one new responsibility as well: driving another mother and her son to and from the Stanford hospital, where the son was undergoing treatment for lymphoma. Mom had never met them before last fall. Yet, when she heard that they were new to the area, she gave them support and gained friendship. This type of behavior is not out of the ordinary for my mom. When one of her colleagues in Boston got diagnosed with breast cancer, Mom organized a food drop-off for the family. When she saw that a bright student was failing her class, she took him aside and bought him a textbook after learning he couldn't afford them. This Thanksgiving, she learned that a group of students could not go home for the break. Mom invited them over for a home-cooked dinner. The day after that Thanksgiving dinner, my mom was diagnosed for the second time with acute myelogenus leukemia (AML), a cancer of the blood -- after eight years in remission. Now, she desperately needs a bone marrow transplant as soon as possible. Robin Roberts found a match, but others likely won't be as lucky . Due to certain genetic markers, her match will almost certainly come from someone from her birthplace -- Kerala, in southern India. But South Asian donors of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Nepalese, Bhutanese, Maldivian or Sri Lankan descent are some of the least-represented groups in the National Marrow Donor Program. Some campaigns recruiting South Asians suggest that a South Asian like my mom has a 1 in 20,000 chance of finding a match, while the chance is 1 in 8 for Caucasians. When the news of my mother's illness became known, it seemed like everyone we had ever met -- and even people we hadn't -- were asking how they could help us. Our friends in California set up an Internet-based food delivery system. Our friends in Boston flooded us with care packages. Once we learned that Mom needed a transplant, her former students, friends, and colleagues -- even those she did not know personally -- started setting up bone marrow drives around the country. On December 27, we got a belated but incredible Christmas present -- Mom's doctors had found 12 potential bone marrow matches! The drives stopped, and we breathed a sigh of relief. It didn't occur to us that none of the 12 potential matches would work out, or that people would back out of donating their bone marrow. So we were shocked when we got the heartbreaking news that half of the potential donors had refused to follow up. The other six did, but were ruled out upon further testing. Our spirits were crushed. Why I donated my bone marrow . Once more, those who care about Mom stepped up to bring us hope. They launched a campaign site, NaliniNeedsYou.com, and a Facebook site that has been seen by more than 1 million people (including more than 60,000 in India) and received more than 3,500 ""likes"" so far. They also created a video (NaliniNeedsYou.com) that had 4,500 views in its first three days on YouTube and more than 100,000 views through the Stanford Facebook page. More than 150 drives targeting South Asians were organized all over the world, held at colleges, temples, companies and festivals. Thousands of people signed up to be on the National Bone Marrow registry. Although we have not yet found a match for my mom, at least six of these people have proved to be potential matches for other people desperately needing a transplant. Two weeks ago, we found out that Mom had a match from India. We were ecstatic. But two days later, we found out that donor, too, was unwilling to donate. Although donation is generally safe and painless, the chief barriers are psychological and cultural. There is a diversity of opinions about biological donation across cultures, with some more traditional ones considering the practice taboo. This might be one reason why India, the world's second-largest nation, has a bone marrow registry of 39,000 people, according to DATRI, a nonprofit organization which drives and maintains registries worldwide. In comparison, there are 10.5 million donors on the United States' National Marrow Donor Program. Of those, only 208,000, or nearly 2%, are South Asian. In fact, we learned that the potential match two weeks ago -- a young man from India -- had been talked out of donating by his parents. Why many would-be bone marrow, blood stem cell donors back out . Being a bone marrow donor is easy. Screening is a simple swab of the cheek, and if you are found to be a match, donation is usually a simple outpatient procedure called Peripheral Blood Stem Cell collection. The donor receives injections for a few days before the donation to boost their own blood-forming cells. These new cells are then collected through an IV and filtered from the rest of the blood. My dream is to give Mom the gift of life -- in the form of a bone marrow donor. Sadly, neither my sister nor I are matches. So I'll settle for challenging everyone who reads this to get on the Bone Marrow Registry. If you are already a member, I salute you, but I challenge you to spread the word, so that my mom -- or someone else's mom, dad, sibling, child or friend -- can receive the gift of life. Act now. You can register at Join.BeTheMatch.org. If you would like to try to donate for Mom, please submit the code ""nalini"" so that your swab kits can be expedited.","My mother's leukemia returned after eight years in remission .

"London (CNN) -- The widow of poisoned Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko asserted Tuesday that only a public inquiry will bring her justice in the death of her husband. ""I still believe in British justice. It's not easy because I didn't expect this long wait,"" Marina Litvinenko said outside the Royal Court of Justice after a pre-inquest hearing Tuesday. Marina Litvinenko wants a public inquiry instead of an inquest, which, in Britain, is a proceeding to establish the facts around a sudden or unexplained death. A public inquiry is a different proceeding that would ""enable the fullest possible investigation"" into Alexander Litvinenko's death and, unlike an inquest, can receive evidence behind closed doors, the coroner said during Tuesday's hearing. In Litvinenko's case, such evidence could involve matters of national security. On Tuesday, Coroner Sir Robert Owen said he is waiting for a response from the secretary of justice on his petition last week to hold a public inquiry instead of an inquest. Litvinenko, a former KGB agent and fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistle-blower on the FSB, the KGB's successor. He died at a London hospital November 23, 2006, after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square. In a deathbed statement, Litvinenko blamed Putin, an accusation the Kremlin has strongly denied. Marina Litvinenko's lawyer, Ben Emmerson, said during Tuesday's hearing the widow would be unable to play a role in an ongoing proceedings if the government refused the coroner's request. ""The inquest should now stand adjourned. There should be a full stop at the inquest until the matter is resolved,"" Emmerson said. Neil Garnham, a lawyer representing the home secretary at the hearing, said a decision on a public inquiry would be made as quickly as possible. Emmerson charged Tuesday that a foreign office minister made what he said was an ""improper approach"" to Litvinenko's widow while British Prime Minister David Cameron and Putin met in Sochi, Russia, last month. The representative approached the widow without reaching her legal team first, Emmerson said. He wanted assurances for Litvinenko that discussions in Sochi would not affect the government's attitude to a full investigation into her husband's death, Emmerson added. ""I have to say I am astonished,"" Owen said about the contact. Garnham said nothing improper occurred. ""The foreign office knew that there was likely to be some reporting in the public press of a meeting between Foreign Office ministers and Russian officials about security matters. As a matter of simple courtesy, the minister telephoned Mrs. Litvinenko to let her know of the fact of the meeting, not to discuss the contents, but simply to inform her,"" Garnham said. The next hearing into the case is expected in early July. Prosecutors in London want Russia to extradite Andrei Lugovoi, suspected in the killing, but Russia has repeatedly refused to do so. In another hearing last December, the counsel to the inquest, Hugh Davies, said evidence provided by the U.K. government shows Russian involvement in the former KGB agent's death and ""does establish a prima facie case as to the culpability of the Russian state in the death of Alexander Litvinenko."" In that hearing, Emmerson said Litvinenko was working for the British intelligence service MI6 and had been tasked by MI6 with working also for the Spanish intelligence service as it investigated Russian mafia activities in Spain. While ill in the hospital, Litvinenko called Lugovoi about a planned trip together to Spain, a phone call that was witnessed by his wife, Emmerson said. The men were both to provide intelligence to the Spanish prosecutor investigating Russian mafia links to the Kremlin and to Putin, Emmerson said. In March, exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky was found dead in the United Kingdom, and his death was deemed ""consistent with hanging"" with no sign of a violent struggle, British investigators said. But the death of Berezovsky, 67, triggered speculation about the fate of a onetime tycoon known for his opposition to Putin. Berezovsky also blamed the Kremlin for the death of Litvinenko. For years, Berezovsky bankrolled the effort of Litvinenko's widow to push for an inquest into her husband's death. Last month, Edward Lucas, international editor of The Economist, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that Litvinenko was a former security official -- akin to an FBI agent. ""He annoyed the Kremlin in lots of ways. He had been involved in domestic power battles in the Kremlin, where he complained about the role of organized crime inside the Russian security service. He then defected very publicly,"" said Lucas, author of ""Deception: The Untold Story of East-West Espionage Today."" ""In effect they used a ... radioactive weapon, a weapon of terror against a British citizen in broad daylight in the streets of London endangering lots of other people,"" Lucas said. ""I think we still don't quite understand what the Russian motivation was. What we do know is that the British government doesn't want to get into detail about how they know about it, and that to me suggests that they were tapping Russian phones, reading Russian diplomatic communications, bugging Russian officers."" CNN's Claudia Rebaza reported from London and Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles.","Widow of Alexander Litvinenko says an expanded investigation would bring justice .

"(CNN) -- Nearly three decades after a member of his band launched a protest against apartheid, Bruce Springsteen is performing in South Africa next year for the first time. Springsteen will take the stage in Cape Town on January 28 and 29. He'll then head to Johannesburg, where he'll play a gig on February 1. The Boss will perform with his E Street Band, whose member Steven Van Zandt founded the Artists United Against Apartheid protest group in 1985. Band member Van Zandt enlisted big names to join him in the hit song ""Sun City,"" which slammed the apartheid government in South Africa. Dozens of performers took part, including Springsteen, Bono, Bob Dylan and the late Lou Reed. The legalized racial segregation enforced by the South African government ended in 1994, when Nelson Mandela was elected the nation's first black president. Springsteen has sold more than 65 million albums in the United States and 120 million worldwide.","The Boss will perform with his E Street Band .

"(CNN) -- Here's the short, tragic story of a little car in China that nobody wanted. Some time back in 2012, a blue van was innocently parked along Peace Road in the village of Huayang in Sichuan Province. And it just sat there. Abandoned. The owner nowhere to be found. We still don't know what happened to him. Or her. But we'll just have to assume this person died or is in the middle of a really good ""Law & Order"" marathon. Don't laugh. It's how I lost most of my 20s. Just me and Detective Briscoe. And a bowl of gravy. Eventually, over the course of a year, Mother Nature did her thing and the van became consumed by vines. Amazingly, the foliage almost completely engulfed every part of the vehicle. And when people on the Internet started sharing pictures of this crazy car-bush, it sort of became a celebrity. Not in the George Clooney kind of way. But in the drunk-and-naked-at-a-Bar-Mitzvah YouTube kind of way. ""Hey, who wants to see my shofar?"" ""Go home, Rabbi."" So, people online started paying attention to this ever-growing mound of foliage with a funny name -- in China, vehicles that are unloved and abandoned are referred to as ""jiangshiche"" or ""zombie cars."" Eventually, police managed to contact the original owner of the ""zombie car,"" Wang Ping, who explained that he had sold his blue van over three years ago but couldn't recall the buyer's name. So, authorities finally decided to just get rid of the damn thing. However, when they came to take it away, police were unable to dig the van out from beneath all the vines. It had simply become too thick and thorny. So, they just towed it off, foliage and all, hauling what appeared to be a giant bush slowly and hilariously down the highway. Photos were taken, and, thus, this week, China's famous ""zombie car"" emerged once again to bask in the warm glow of the Internet's spotlight. So, that's the short, tragic (and completely pointless) story of a car that nobody wanted, and the Internet who loved it. To be honest, seeing this thing all alone kind of made me sad. I care about my car like a big, stupid child. And I only recently realized this. You see, the other day I was at the auto shop waiting on a minor repair -- as one does when you have no technical skills beyond heating things in the microwave. So, to pass time at the shop, I started thumbing through some of those hot rod magazines filled with pictures of shiny cars draped by scantily clad women. They had several different ones on the shelf -- Lugs and Jugs, Groin and Driver, The Economist -- I don't remember the exact titles, but you get the point. And as I turned my attention away from those glossy pages of beautiful, perfect steel and skin, and peered through the shop's window into the garage, my gray Saturn suddenly seemed incredibly ... unsexy. You know, because it's a Saturn. Really, there's nothing ""suddenly"" about it. However, almost immediately, this fact didn't matter because, hey, it was mine. Sure, it's big, and stupid, and gray. But it gets me to Kroger. And Kroger has Lean Pockets and Klondike Bars. And, for that, I think it's worthy of a sexy photo shoot. ""There ya go, Tina, get nice and close to those side-impact air bags. Work that cup holder. Wooooooo!"" Anyway, my Saturn is awesome, and you should check it out in next month's issue of Groin and Driver. Follow Jarrett Bellini on Twitter.","In 2012 a car was abandoned in China .

"(CNN) -- A 14-year-old autistic Michigan girl whose mother allegedly tried to poison her with carbon monoxide in a murder-suicide attempt is recovering well, authorities said Tuesday. Isabelle Stapleton is ""awake"" and ""responding,"" according to Sara Swanson, Benzie County prosecuting attorney, after being in critical care for carbon monoxide poisoning following a grisly incident last week in which her mother allegedly attempted to take both of their lives. ""Her condition has continued to improve every day"" since the weekend, Swanson said. On the evening of September 3, Kelli Stapleton and her daughter were transported to hospitals for treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning after police discovered them unconscious inside their family vehicle in a wooded area, according to Sgt. Malcolm Irwin of Michigan State Police. Officers found the vehicle locked with two charcoal grills burning inside, emitting carbon monoxide and using up the oxygen, according to Irwin. Matt Stapleton, Isabelle's father, had called police earlier in the day because ""nobody had seen"" her or her mother ""all day,"" Irwin said. Isabelle was transported to the critical care unit at DeVos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where she remained until she opened her eyes over the weekend, Swanson said. Kelli Stapleton was taken into custody last Wednesday after receiving doctor's clearance. She was arraigned on Thursday and is charged with one count of attempted murder. She is being held without bail and is to appear in court on September 16 for a preliminary examination, according to Swanson. In a preliminary examination, a judge rules on whether there is sufficient evidence to support the charges. In her blog, titled ""The Status Woe,"" Kelli Stapleton complained of suffering from ""a severe case of battle fatigue"" on the day of the alleged murder-suicide attempt. The blog is devoted to Isabelle and the post from September 3 mentions the issues surrounding her autism treatment. Stapleton's attorney, Anthony Cicchelli, had no comment. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website that an estimated one in 88 children has been identified with an autism spectrum disorder, or ASD.","Isabelle Stapleton, 14, was found with her mother in a car with charcoal grills burning .

"Phuket, Thailand (CNN) -- Rihanna, like the boy who pointed out that the emperor has no clothes, spoke the truth during her recent visit to the Thai holiday island of Phuket. Or, this being the 21st century, tweeted it, which seems to get the word around even faster than a fairytale. More: Thai locals arrested over Rihanna Instagram photo . Yes, there are seedy X rated ""ping pong"" shows on Phuket, similar to those found on Bangkok's Patpong Road. And yes, the locals will even abuse Thailand's wildlife if there's money to be made. At least the singer hit the right note about Patong, the island's main tourist beach, and Soi Bangla, its tawdry walking street that so many Phuket tourists for some reason find irresistible. Over the years, we've watched the Patong thoroughfare become more than just a place where you can have your souvenir holiday snap taken with a big-breasted ladyboy in a sparkly costume. Slowly but surely, the sea, sun and sand that Phuket has sought to promote has become sex, stinks and sleaze in Soi Bangla. There's an unmissable sewer smell from time to time -- a tribute to the local council and its ability to find excuses for doing nothing to solve Patong's problems. Tuk-tuks taking over all the parking spots? Sorry, no answer there. Roads with potholes big enough to swallow a motorcycle? Goodness, wish we could fix that. Soi Bangla's in-your-face sex show touts . Soi Bangla says so much more about Patong, and Rihanna expressed it well. She tweeted with great honesty: ""Either I was phuck wasted lastnight, or I saw a Thai woman pull a live bird,2 turtles,razors,shoot darts and ping pong, all out of her pu$$y."" The touts for the sex shows are probably the worst thing about Soi Bangla. They are everywhere, sticking photos of body parts in the faces of tourists. Nobody who takes a walk down the tourist walking street can avoid them. The touts shouldn't be there. The sex shows also shouldn't be there. And the poor, sad, cute slow lorises ... Rihanna said it all about them, too, in an Instagram photograph where she held one and the poor animal looked like a ball of fur on a stick. In reaction to what threatened to be a deluge of bad international publicity surrounding Rihanna's revelations, Phuket authorities arrested two loris touts Sunday night. They were later released on bail. Was the real issue solved? Of course not. The shocking state of affairs raised in Rihanna's tweet was not addressed. There were no sex show touts arrested. None of the tawdry Soi Bangla exhibitions closed. The wildlife abuses and the sex hows will go on, and on, and on. There's too much corrupt money involved for them to be stopped. How shameful it is that it takes a visiting celebrity to highlight that the authorities in Patong remain blind to the sleaze and the wildlife abuse around them. If Phuket seriously wants to attract quality tourists, then Soi Bangla is the perfect place to start a cleanup campaign. Put Soi Bangla back on track, and some other celebrities just might visit Phuket ... and tweet about the sun, sand and sea. More: The trouble with Phuket and how it can be fixed .
