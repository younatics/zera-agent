"By . Paul Collins . Brazil legend Pele has called his country a ‘disgrace’ for their poor planning ahead of next month’s World Cup. There have been a number of delays to the completion of a number of the stadiums as well as widespread theft and corruption in the lead up to the tournament. But the three time World Cup winner condemned the protesters ahead of the tournament. Concerns: Pele has been critical of the preparations in Brazil for the World Cup . Selfie time: A student takes a selfie with Pele . He said: ‘There has been significant time to get the stadiums finished. ‘The situation is unacceptable – it is a disgrace. The political situation is difficult. ‘Our team has nothing to do with the ongoing corruption that has delayed construction of the stadiums. ‘It is not the problem of the players but the situation worries me a great deal. The evil people who have stolen all the money are to blame. Protests against corruption are understandable – but not the use of the force.’ Prediction time: Pele says both Spain and Germany have a good chance . Ahead of the tournament -which kicks off on June 12 – Pele believes hosts Brazil have a good chance but has also says Spain have a good chance to retain their crown. He said: I hope Brazil win it, but for me the two teams in Europe are Germany and Spain. ‘Spain have played outstanding football for a number of years. Germany are well organised and favour a very attacking style – they almost play a more Brazilian way than us.’","Three time winner says preparations for the World Cup have been a disaster .

"By . David Kent . Manchester United's ever-increasing portfolio of unusual official sponsors just got weirder after stars Robin van Persie, David de Gea and Adnan Januzaj were roped in to advertise a range of Korean meatballs. Perhaps the threesome were being punished for the club's most unsuccessful season in Premier League history, especially as none seemed able to raise a smile during some acting so wooden it deserved to carry a fire warning. The players were filmed going through a few moves inter-spliced with shots of some rice/pasta accompanied dishes that look as if they could have come straight from the picture menu of a downmarket takeaway. Dutch courage: Robin van Persie goes through the motions for another unusual United sponsor . Not fair! Youngster Adnan Januzaj had a good enough debut season not to be punished this way . Yummy! The Samboo Korean meatballs don't look the most appealing of three-minute meals . In safe hands: David de Gea struggled to raise a smile while expanding the club's Asian market . But, the most embarrassing moment is reserved for the end when all three players are forced to stare into the camera and announce 'We love Samboo!' (meaning three-minute meals). Since the Glazers gained control of United, the club has collected an expanding list of sponsors you may not usually associate with a football club.

And Lancaster doesn't see bringing him back into the hold as a risk. ‘I don’t view it as a risk,’ he said. ‘It is an opportunity. Ultimately, selection will be affected by how effective Danny is off the field in a training environment and his ability to apply his skills to our game plan. ‘If he’s good enough he’ll get the opportunity to go to New Zealand and if he’s not quite ready he’ll hopefully play in the Barbarians game (at Twickenham on June 1) as the beginning of his return to international rugby. ‘I’ve spoken to him in part (about team culture) but there will be a lot more when he comes into camp. I’ll arrange a one-on-one with every player. Danny’s might be a little bit longer. But of course he can train his way on to the plane. All the players can.’ A new man?

They're the talismen, the good luck charms whose mere presence on the pitch always seems to inspire the team to victory. A look at the best player win percentages from the Barclays Premier League season just passed throws up some unexpected names. Lucky charms: The players with the best win percentage for each Premier League club during the 2013-2014 season (minimum of 10 matches). Source: Opta . Talisman: Manchester City won 80 per cent of matches in which Joleon Lescott took his place in their defence . Heading for victory: Liverpool won 85 per cent of the games in which Daniel Agger (centre) featured . At champions Manchester City, Joleon Lescott's presence in the heart of the defence came with an 80 per cent win ratio. He may have only played the minimum threshold of 10 matches in this Opta statistical analysis, but City won eight of them. Less reassuringly, Lescott was involved in two of City's six Premier League defeats - at Cardiff and Sunderland. At Liverpool, Daniel Agger was the lucky charm with the side collecting all three points in 17 of the 20 matches in which he featured - a resounding win percentage of 85 per cent. Nacho Monreal had a similar effect on Arsenal, helping them to 19 victories in the 23 matches in which he featured (82.6 per cent). Spot on: Arsenal won 19 of 23 matches in which Nacho Monreal played a part this season . Sign him up! Chelsea always seem to get all three points when Ashley Cole is at left-back . And if Chelsea need any further persuasion to sign stalwart Ashley Cole up for another 12 months, look at his impressive record of 12 wins resulting from the 17 Premier League games he figured in this season. Manchester United endured a torrid campaign by their standards but they at least tasted success on the rare occasions Darren Fletcher made the starting XI - the Scot boasted a two-thirds win percentage, as did Everton's John Stones. By contrast, some teams experienced that winning feeling so rarely in the nine months just passed that even their talismen have laughable win percentages. Winning habit: Darren Fletcher always seemed to inspire Man United to victory during an otherwise dire campaign . Star in the making: Everton's John Stones is not only very talented, he's fairly lucky for the team too . Fabio was Cardiff's most successful man but his 23.1 per cent win ratio looks pretty paltry when set against some of the others.

England intend to tap into Jonny Wilkinson’s expertise and experience after he retires at the end of this season – and the iconic fly-half is keen to take on a coaching role with the national team. Toulon’s 34-year-old playmaker confirmed on Monday that he will end his playing career when the current campaign is over – leading to a torrent of tributes to his record-breaking achievements at Test and club level. And the man whose drop goal famously clinched the 2003 World Cup for Sir Clive Woodward’s England side expressed a desire to represent his country again one day, in a management or mentoring capacity. ‘Never say never,’ said Wilkinson,’ when asked about plans to go into coaching. ‘If I can help make a difference – even if it’s only a small percentage – then I would love to do that. With England? Of course, that would be amazing, but at the same time if I can work with just one person and have a positive effect, that’s good enough to begin with. Defining moment: Jonny Wilkinson kicks the winning drop goal to win the 2003 World Cup final in Australia . Pround as punch: Wilkinson and Mike Catt celebrate in the dressing room with the World Cup trophy . ‘It’s . a real desire of mine, having played with so many people who have . helped me in my career.

Asked if he was in danger of being pigeon-holed, Hales replied: ‘A little bit, yes, and I think it’s a little bit harsh. Up until last year, when I had a shocker with the red ball, I’d averaged 40 opening at Trent Bridge, which is not a bad record at all. ‘I’m keen to learn from last year and move on. It’s too early to be pigeon-holed as a T20 player.

"By . Ed Hawkins . The net is closing in on a world renowned former cricketer after a New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum revealed he had been approached to fix matches. Sportsmail has learned that McCullum told ICC anti-corruption investigators a player offered him up to £107,000 to underperform. It is thought to be the same player for whom former New Zealand Test batsman Lou Vincent admitted fixing matches in both county cricket and in the short-lived Indian Cricket League. McCullum’s claim will send further shockwaves through the game, particularly in England as the batsman said his ‘hero’ tried to bribe him in a Worcester cafe during New Zealand’s tour in 2008. Uncovered: New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum was approached to fix matches . The detail of McCullum’s evidence includes how the former star told him how to fix by batting slowly and to hide the money trail by buying property through an employee of the ICC, the world game’s governing body. The star also told him that ‘the big boys’ in international cricket were doing it. McCullum was first approached in 2008 in Kolkata before the start of the inaugural Indian Premier League. He told investigators that the star telephoned him to meet at his hotel to discuss a ‘business opportunity’. ‘We spent some time talking about various things over dinner,’ McCullum told investigators. ‘During the course of this conversation he asked me if I knew what spread betting was in cricket games. I told him not really, so he took a piece of paper and wrote down and explained the process to me. Shockwaves: The New Zealand batsman said he was approached by a cricket 'hero' ‘I was really shocked as I saw X as a good friend and it totally confused me. X said that everybody was doing this in games. ‘He said that the “Big Boys” in international cricket were doing it and he didn’t want me to miss out. I am sure that he mentioned names to me but I cannot remember, although I seem to think that X mainly mentioned Asian cricketers. Using the piece of paper X explained the basic principles which were to score below a certain rate for the first six or so overs and then towards the end of the game there was another split. X told me he had done this himself. ‘[He] told me that potentially he could get for me from between $70,000-180,000 (£42-000-£107,000) a game. ‘X told me he had a good group working for him in the ICL and I understand this to mean fixing for him. It was my opinion then, as it is now, that X was actively concerned in fixing... I believed he was asking me to do the same thing for him in the IPL as others were doing in the ICL.’ McCullum asked the man how he was able to take money back to New Zealand without raising suspicion. Local: McCullum was approached in Worcester during New Zealand's tour of England in 2008 . ‘X told me that you don’t take or send it back to New Zealand. He explained that he had a man in Dubai who was associated with cricket. Through him you purchase a property in Dubai which you retain for a couple of years before selling it. ‘The money could then be moved wherever you want to send it because to all intents and purposes, it would appear to be profit from property deals rather than fixing. X told me the name of that man in Dubai.’ Despite McCullum saying he has ‘never, ever fixed’ he didn’t have the courage to say no immediately and instead said he would think about it before returning to his hotel in a ‘state of shock’. Later the star telephoned him and McCullum told him he was not interested. ‘He was a hero who became a friend so I always found it difficult to say no,’ McCullum said. Lifting the lid: Lou Vincent revealed that he played in at least 12 fixed games . It was a matter of weeks before the superstar tried to coerce McCullum again. After his stint in the IPL, McCullum joined the New Zealand squad in England. ‘We were staying in Worcester and he called asking to catch up. He said he was just down the road and suggested we meet for breakfast. I thought it strange he was in the area. X asked if I’d changed my mind and I knew he was talking about fixing. I told him I had not.’ McCullum could be charged by the ICC for failure to report an approach to fix as it is a breach of the corruption code.

Official figures show that since May 6, 2014, half of the United States was experiencing some level of drought. Nearly 15 percent of the nation was gripped by extreme to exceptional drought. As of May 6, 2014, half of the United States was experiencing some level of drought, with almost 15 percent gripped by extreme to exceptional drought. The map above was developed by the U.S. National Drought Monitor, a partnership of U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It depicts areas of drought in progressive shades of orange to red. It is based on measurements of climate, soil, and water conditions from more than 350 federal, state, and local observers around the country. Nasa also provided experimental measurements and models to the drought monitoring effort. For the Plains and the Southwest, it’s a pattern that has been persistent for much of the past several years, researchers say. 'Kansas continues to set the edge of the intense drought that seems to be waking up and pushing rapidly north along with warmer temperatures,' said Mark Svoboda of the National Drought Mitigation Center. 'Soil moisture and groundwater levels are hurting well in front of the peak demand season, as the cumulative impacts of such an intense multi-year drought are already glaringly evident. 'The story is even bleaker in the southern Plains, where the heat and drought are even more pronounced and entrenched across western Oklahoma and much of Texas as well. 'Streamflow and groundwater levels are hurting, given the long duration and sustained intensity of this drought, which is now going on close to four years.'

A spate of wildfires in southern California burned at least 30 homes and even forced the evacuation of the San Onofre nuclear power plant. The entire state of California is in some level of drought, much of it extreme to exceptional. Snowpack is 50 percent of normal in many locations in the West, and Svoboda noted that a lot of snow has completely melted before it normally would. Drought has had a serious impact on fruit and vegetable agriculture in California, and news reports sounded the alarm for grains and livestock in the Plains and South Central West. At least 54 percent of the nation’s wheat crop is affected by some level of drought, as is 30 percent of corn, and 48 percent of cattle.","Since May 6, 2014, half of the United States was experiencing drought .

Indecisive: A textile designer in Budapest has created experimental fabric (pictured) that can change colour in seconds like a chameleon as it is filled with electronics . Judit Eszter Karpati created the interactive fabric using computer programming, engineering and electronic devices. ‘My main interest in textile design is the dynamically changing surfaces, structures, integrating interactive technologies into textiles. In my works I’m looking for new ways of interaction between human and textile,’ she wrote on her blog. The fabric, which comprises her Chromosonic research project, consists of ‘arduino [a microcontroller] with 12V power supply and 20 custom PCBs [printed circuit boards] driving and controlling 4 industrial 24V DC power supplies, that heat two handmade textile woven with nichrome wires and screen-printed with thermochromatic dying, revealing the pre-programmed patterns.’ A textile designer in Budapest has taken the first steps to creating clothing that can change colour like a chameleon (pictured). The lizards have specialized cells - chromatophores - which contain pigments in their cytoplasm, in three layers below their transparent outer skin, but the fabric uses electronics to change colour . Making a mark: Patterns on the fabric are generated from sound files and heat. People also can leave traces on the surface by touching it (pictured) She created her fabric to turn digital media into textile art. ‘Chromosonic research project investigates how the world of digital media becomes tangible through the textile medium.

"By . Ben Spencer . It is said that lightning never strikes twice, which is nonsense or there would be no need for lightning conductors . It is said that lightning never strikes twice. But scientists have long been puzzled as to how lightning even strikes at all. The laws of physics mean it should require a huge electrical current – much bigger than that in a storm cloud – for a lightning bolt to reach the earth. Now British scientists believe they have the answer, and it may enable forecasters to predict when a lightning storm is due. Scientists agree that lightning is caused by ice particles colliding within a storm cloud to create an electric charge. But they have been divided on how that charge creates a bolt big enough to reach the ground. Now researchers at Reading University have suggested that a stream of high-energy particles pumped out by the sun, known as a solar wind, creates a ‘pathway’ needed for lightning to travel. They say that the solar wind – in which the particles are propelled from the sun’s atmosphere at around a million miles per hour – charges the air, meaning a lesser current is needed for a lightning bolt to strike. Cosmic rays – another source of charged particles from exploding stars on the other side of the Universe – are thought to be another trigger for lightning. The results could prove useful for weather forecasters, since solar winds synchronise with the rotation of the sun, sweeping into the Earth’s atmosphere at regular intervals. As these streams are also tracked by Nasa, it offers the potential for predicting the severity of dangerous storms weeks in advance. Dr Chris Scott, of Reading University’s department of meteorology, said: ‘Getting a lightning bolt to jump through the air requires a much bigger charge than that in stormclouds. Laboratory tests show that it would require about 150 kilovolts per metre (kV/m) to generate lightning, but you would expect to generally see no more than 30 kV/m in a stormcloud. ‘We think the high-speed solar wind streams provide just enough charge to trigger a lightning bolt in a cloud that is ready to release one.’ He said that the sun’s rotation means the streams of particles ‘wash past our planet with predictable regularity’. ‘Such information could prove useful when producing long-range weather forecasts,’ he added. How lightning strikes: a what it does guide . The particle stream from a solar wind varies in density, temperature and speed in a pattern that is dictated by the sun’s rotation. The researchers analysed Met Office data on lightning strikes over the UK from 2000 to 2005. They compared this with information from Nasa’s Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft, which lies between the Sun and the Earth and measures solar winds. There was an average of 422 lightning strikes across the UK in the 40 days after the arrival of each solar wind, compared with an average of 321 in the previous 40 days. The rate of lightning strikes peaked between 12 and 18 days after the arrival of the solar wind. Scientists hope to eventually use such data, along with weather forecasts, to pinpoint when lightning could strike. Around 24,000 deaths around the world each year are caused by people being struck by lightning. Professor Giles Harrison, co-author of the study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, said: ‘By increasing our understanding of weather on earth we are learning more about its important links with space weather.’","Scientists agree that lightning is caused by ice particles colliding within a storm cloud to create an electric charge .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . To date, solar panels have been installed in a host of locations, from roofs to open fields. One bit of infrastructure that has yet to be exploited though is perhaps also the largest in total area that covers Earth – the roads our cars drive on. But a company in Idaho is hoping to change all that by creating ‘Solar Roadways’ that not only provide power but also create smart digital driving surfaces as well. Scroll down for video . Idaho-based Solar Roadways has revealed their prototype for a new type of road that is embedded with solar panels (artist's illustration shown). By gathering energy for the sun it could provide energy to nearby towns and cities, and even electric cars as well . Co-founders Scott and Julie Brusaw are currently seeking for their ambitious proposal on Indiegogo. They have developed a small segment of solar-powered road to prove their concept works. And they’re hoping to one day roll it out on roads through the US and ultimately the rest of the world in their bid to provide a novel method of accessing green energy. Scott and Julie explain that their design has a number of uses. First . is obviously the ability to harness the power of the sun – they say, if . installed nationwide in the US, their roads could provide more renewable energy . than the entire energy the country uses. This . electricity can be transferred to nearby buildings, neighbourhoods and . cities, and they claim it can also charge electric cars. The prototype road involves the use of inter-connected hexagons, each in turn made of 10% recycled glass. Each hexagon has four layers, with the technology inside providing solar functionality. At the bottom is a base layer of recyclable materials, such as glass, that is placed on the ground. Above this is the support structure, which has circuitry embedded into it, and on top of these are LED lights. Within . the circuitry layer can also be found the solar cells, which collect . light from the sun and convert it into useful electricity. And . finally, on top is a reinforced glass layer with traction support for . vehicles, which can support trucks up to 250,000 pounds (115,000 . kilograms). The company was co-founded by husband and wife Scott and Julie Brusaw, pictured at a glass recycling centre used to manufacture their prototype road, who are currently seeking $1 million (£590,000) on Indiegogo to begin production of their concept surface . Solar Roadways received funding from the Federal Highway Administration in 2009 to build their prototype solar-powered parking lot (pictured), which was completed at the end of March, and they are now looking ahead to begin wider production . The innovative additional features that have also garnered a lot of interest. The LEDs within the layer, powered by the sun, would allow the surface to become ‘smart roads’. These can be controlled remotely and light up to provide guidance to . drivers – some could warn of upcoming hazards, or others could . reallocate spaces in a car park, for example . The panels also contain heating elements that will instantly melt snow and ice that falls onto them. The heating elements, however, are powered by the regular electricity grid, which the Solar Roadways would be connected to. Solar . Roadways estimates there is about 31,000 square miles (80,000 square . kilometres) of usable road surfaces in the US that could be converted . into solar-powered roads. In 2009 they received a contract from the Federal Highway Administration to build the prototype. But now they are hoping for $1 million (£590,000) in funding from Indiegogo in order to begin mass production of the road. Scott and Julie say there are 31,000 square miles (80,000 square kilometres) of road surface in the US that their solar panelled road could be installed on, providing not only energy but also smart road surfaces as well that can change colour to give drivers information (artist's illustration shown) LEDs within the panels have the ability to change colour. This could, for example, warn drivers of upcoming hazards or reallocate spaces in a car park . A heating element within the panels also makes them resistant to ice and snow.

MIT researchers have developed a special mesh that can extract the water from morning fog, channeling it into reservoirs. They have already trialled the system in Chile, and say it could have a dramatic impact on the lives of remote communities. Scroll down for video . One of the fences already installed in Chile. The special mesh can extract the water from morning fog, channeling it into reservoirs. By changing the size of the holes and fibres, researchers say they have already improved the system by 500% . Fences made from a simple system of suspended mesh structures are placed on hilltops in areas with persistent fog and prevailing westerly winds. When the fog arrives, the water condenses in the mesh and drip down pipes to water butts, where is can be fed directly into watering systems or used by locals as drinking water. Variations in the mesh spacing as well as the size and the wettability of the fibers in the mesh all affect the volume of water that can be collected each day. Researchers at MIT's School of Engineering, working with colleagues at the Pontificial University of Chile in Santiago, are harvesting potable water from the coastal fog that forms on the edge of one of the driest regions on earth. Using a simple system of suspended mesh structures, placed on hilltops in areas with persistent fog and prevailing westerly winds, local Chilean communities collect fog water for drinking and agricultural use. 'This water has been naturally desalinated by the sun, we are trying to build meshes to capture it straight out of the air,' said Gareth McKinley of MIT, who is leading the project. Fog collecting technology is still in its infancy but laboratory experiments have shown that variations in the mesh spacing as well as the size and the wettability of the fibers in the mesh all affect the volume of water that can be collected each day. The fences feed into water reservoirs . The researchers created dozens of lab systems to test different types of mesh . 'By changing the size of the holes and fibres, we've improved the system by 500%' Regions were the system has been installed have alreasy seen major changes. Former fisherman have turned into farmers because of fog water, the team said. 'The technology holds great promise as a locally deployable and scalable alternative to other energy-intensive desalination technologies,' MIT said. 'Mesh-based Fog Harvesters are passive, inexpensive to fabricate, with close to zero operating costs, and can be deployed in similar environments throughout the world.' There's approx 10bn m2 of fog water in Chilean cloud, 4% of that will provide drinking water for an entire year, the team say.","Mesh can extract water from fog .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The quino checkerspot, found in Mexico and California, has moved to higher altitudes to avoid extinction, scientists claim . As the planet warms, animals and plants are learning to adapt to their new environment by either migrating or evolving, new research has revealed. Many scientists believe the rate of climate change is too rapid for various species to keep up. But two new studies have offered some hope that experts may have underestimated their abilities. The first study reveals how a species of butterfly named the quino checkerspot has defied expectations of extinction by moving to cooler climes and changing its diet. The quino checkerspot, found in Mexico and California, moved to higher altitudes to avoid extinction, according to research presented at the Butterfly Conservation's symposium in Southampton. Its rapid adaption offers some hope to scientists that other insects could be able to change their environment and survive a warmer climate. Separate research led by Stanford University scientist Steve Palumbi found how some corals can quickly switch on or off certain genes in order to survive in warmer-than-average tidal waters. The research team discovered corals can adjust their internal functions to tolerate hot water 50 times faster than they would adapt through evolutionary change alone. Research led by Stanford University found thatsome corals can quickly switch on or off certain genes in order to survive in warmer-than-average tidal waters. Pictured is Stanford graduate student Rachael Bay taking samples from an Acropora hyacinthus colony at the National Park of American Samoa . They were once believed to be impervious to fire, but it appears that increasing temperatures are having a shrinking effect on salamanders. Wild salamanders in North America are getting smaller as their surroundings get warmer and drier, forcing them to burn more energy in a hotter climate. Researchers from the University of Maryland found that salamanders in the Appalachians today were nearly a tenth smaller than their ancestors in the Fifties. The changes were most marked in the Southern Appalachians and at low elevations – settings where detailed weather records showed the climate has warmed and dried out most. Scientists have predicted that some animals will get smaller in response to climate change and, the researchers sasy, this is strong confirmation of that prediction. ‘The temperature of coral reefs is variable, so it stands to reason that corals should have some capacity to respond to different heat levels,’ Professor Palumbi said. ‘These results tell us that both nature and nurture play a role in deciding how heat-tolerant a coral colony is. ‘Nurture, the effect of environment, can change heat tolerance much more quickly - within the lifetime of one coral rather than over many generations.’ It’s not just butterflies and corals that are adapting. From chipmunks to Mediterranean spiders, scientists are increasingly tracking how animals are evolving to cope with the effects of hotter temperatures. ‘Most of the models that ecologists are putting out are assuming that there's no adaptive capacity. And that's silly,’ Ary Hoffmann, a geneticist at the University of Melbourne told National Geographic. ‘Organisms are not static.’ Writing for Pacific Standard, systems biologist Michael White said scientists tracking the movements of animals have repeatedly found that plants and animals have altered their behaviour in response to earlier springs and milder temperatures. Dr White cited the work of a team of . scientists at the University of California-Berkeley as an example of how . creatures are adapting to warmer temperatures. The . scientists studied alpine chipmunks living in Yosemite National Park . and found that over 100 years the animals have moved to higher altitudes . as the average temperature of the park has risen by 3°C. Scientists studied alpine chipmunks living in Yosemite National Park and found that over 100 years, the animals have moved to higher altitudes as the average temperature of the park has risen by three degrees Celsius . DNA evidence suggests the European wasp spider (pictured) is evolving and has colonised new areas as they seek cooler climates. The spiders primarily lived in Mediterranean regions until the 1930s but have gradually crept northwards to colonise Scandinavia, Poland and the Baltic region . DNA evidence also suggests the European wasp spider is evolving and have colonised new areas as they seek cooler climates. The spiders primarily lived in Mediterranean regions until the 1930s but have gradually crept northwards to colonise Scandinavia, Poland and the Baltic region. Interestingly while scientists thought they were trying to find new places to live that were the same temperature as the Mediterranean before temperatures have risen, the spiders have actually moved into regions that are cooler than their original homes. The reason for their behaviour is they have been mating with spiders that like the cold, to create an invading species that can survive freezing temperatures that would kill its Mediterranean relatives, researchers from Germany's Max Plank Institute told Dr White. A 2011 review of data on hundreds of moving species found a average shift to higher altitudes of 36 feet (11 metres) per decade and a average shift to higher latitudes of about 10.5 miles (17 km) per decade. ‘I think we should feel impressed by the impact that we have, that we can change the course of evolution around us by the way we change the environment,’ Menno Schilthuizen, from Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands told National Geographic. ‘Our impact is much further and deeper than we tend to think.’ For the first time in millennia, the average level of carbon dioxide has topped 400 parts per million (ppm) for an entire month. April’s . carbon dioxide readings come less than a year after scientists warned . that the amount of the gas in the Earth’s atmosphere could surpass the . 400ppm marker and stay there. The gas is considered by many scientists to be responsible for global warming and has consistently breached the mark for a month – likely for the first time in 800,000 years. April’s average carbon dioxide reading was 401.33ppm, according to scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. The institution is the custodian of the longest continuous record of carbon dioxide measurements,which were started in the 1950s by Charles David Keeling on the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii, USA Today reported. Based on ice core samples  from the Antarctic ice sheet that preserve samples of old air, experts from Scripps said that carbon dioxide levels did not breach 300ppm prior to the industrial revolution for the past 800,000 years.","Quino checkerspot butterfly defied expectation by moving to cooler climes .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Seemingly nonsensical notes in the margins of a rare edition of Homer’s Odyssey have remained unread for 150 years. Until a competition was launched to crack the code in the 1504 Venetian edition of the Odyssey, which contains annotations in an unknown script thought to have been written in the mid-19th century. An Italian computer engineer has won the challenge and has finally solved the mystery – to find that the notes are written in a form of French shorthand. Code cracked: An Italian computer engineer has solved the mystery of what these strange scribbes mean in a rare 16th century copy of Homer's the Odyssey.He found that the notes are written in French shorthand . The script is a system of shorthand invented by Jean Coulon de Thévénot in the late 18th century. The annotations are mostly French translations of words and phrases from the Greek text. 'Every consonant and vowel has a starting shape and they combine together to form new shapes representing syllables,’ code breaker Mr Metilli wrote. 'The vertical alignment is especially important, as the position of a letter above or below the line, or even the length of a letter segment can change the value of the grapheme. This explains why most notes in the Odyssey shorthand are underlined - the line being key to the transcription.' The case of the mystery marginalia began . when the University of Chicago received a donation of Homer’s works from . collector M.C. Lang in 2007, which included the 1504 volume with the . unusual notes. The university library’s Special Collections Research Centre lured linguists, classicists and amateur sleuths to identify and translate the script with a cash prize of $1,000, (£592) which was won by Daniele Metilli, who is studying a digital humanities course at the university. Working with Giula Accetta - a colleague who is proficient in contemporary Italian stenography and fluent in French - he identified the mystery script as a system of shorthand invented by Jean Coulon de Thévénot in the late 18th century and two runners-up reached the same conclusion. The annotations themselves are mostly French translations of words and phrases from the Greek text of the Odyssey. They include lines from the epic poem such as: 'τὴν πάντες μνώοντο περικτίται, meaning 'whom all the neighboring princes wooed.' Daniele Metilli, discovered that the script is a system of shorthand invented by Jean Coulon de Thévénot in the late 18th century and won a $1,000 competition at the University of Chicago to translate text that has remained illegible for 150 years . To crack the code, the duo began with the assumption that it was a system of French stenography in use in the mid-19th century as the notes were dates April 25, 1854. After rejecting several 19th-century French stenographic - or shorthand - systems, they found a chart comparing one of them to the ‘tachygraphie’ or shorthand system invented by Mr Thévenot. They found an 1819 edition of the work online and armed with two contemporary French translations of the Odyssey - one published in 1842 and the other in 1854 - they began the work of decoding the annotations. In Mr . Thévenot’s system, ‘every consonant and vowel has a starting shape and . they combine together to form new shapes representing syllables,’ Metilli wrote. ‘The . vertical alignment is especially important, as the position of a letter . above or below the line, or even the length of a letter segment can . change the value of the grapheme. This explains why most notes in the . Odyssey shorthand are underlined - the line being key to the . transcription.’ The annotations in the book are mostly French translations of words and phrases from the Greek text of the Odyssey, which features here Odysseus, who in this 1920s illustration is homesick . They translated one line of script to read: 'que recherchaient tous les princes dans les entours,' which is a word-for-word translation of a line from the poem: 'whom all the neighboring princes wooed'. Mr Metilli wrote in his blog: 'This is our best match for now and it gives us the certainty that the method we employed is correct,' and shared other examples. In the poem, Ulysses says that Neptune disguised himself as Enipeus and laid with Tyro at the mouth of the river. The person making the notes has underlined important words and written them in shorthand beside the main text, including 'prendant donc sa ressemblence,' which means 'taking his resembelence,' and 'embouchure' for mouth of the river. There are times when the writer gets a translation wrong and makes corrections in their translation of the Greek, mistaking the word 'vain' for 'sterile', for example. Mr Metilli and Ms Accetta are continuing to study the annotations and hope to discover the identity of their author and an explanation for why they only exist in one section of the text. 'We cannot help but feel a bit disheartened that after going this far we still know next to nothing about the annotator. Who is he or she? We do not know.There are no personal references,' he wrote. 'In the annotations, and in the few instances in which the author uses the ﬁrst person it is only to explain why he or she committed a translation mistake. What about the shorthand? It was very popular at the beginning of the 19th Century, but certainly not in 1854. 'Where did the annotator learn the code? What is the motive for its use? These remain open questions.'","The case of the mystery marginalia began when the University of Chicago received a donation of Homer’s works in 2007 that included a rare book .

A major row has broken out over the credibility of a groundbreaking experiment to detect what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. The experiment was hailed as a look at the very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything when the universe expanded very rapidly - a theory called cosmic inflation. However, some researchers have now questioned the results. Scroll down to see the moment the stunned Stanford scientist is told his theory is correct .

Scientists, from left, Clem Pryke, Jamie Bock, Chao-Lin Kuo and John Kovac smile during a news conference at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge to announce their groundbreaking results on gravitational waves . Scientists view the the universe as being made up of a 'fabric of space-time'. This corresponds to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity which was published 1916. Objects in the . universe bend this fabric, and more massive objects bend it more. Gravitational waves are considered ripples in this fabric. They can be produced for instance, when black holes orbit each other or by the merging of galaxies. Gravitational waves are also thought to have been produced during the Big Bang. Online rumours earlier this week claimed that the scientists who reported the find have now admitted to making a mistake. The team missed a key detail in its analysis of galactic dust, the rumours say, making it more likely that the signal came from a source other than gravitational waves. Physicist Adam Falkowski of the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics of Orsay, France, on Monday reported that 'experts now put a finger on what exactly went wrong in BICEP' in a controversial post. 'Among this understandable excitement, we have been aware that the signal has to be confirmed by other experiments before the discovery is established,' he wrote. However, the team behind the experiment has hit back. 'We've done no such thing,' principal investigator John Kovac at Harvard University told New Scientist. 'We tried to do a careful job in the paper of addressing what public information there was, and also being upfront about the uncertainties. 'We are quite comfortable with the approach we have taken.' However, confirmation of the experiment won't be known until another group either supports or opposes their finding, which could happen later this year. According to Albert Einstein when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space-time known as 'gravitational waves'. The very first gravitational waves can tell us about the birth of the universe . and scientists have discovered they leave imprints in cosmic microwave . background radiation - the afterglow of the Big Bang - as they pass . through space. The theory suggests that this intial spurt would have taken the infant universe from something infinitely small to something close to the size of a marble. Earlier this year experts hailed the experiment as a massive step forward - but admitted the theory needed more work. 'It's just unbelievable quite honestly,' Professor Peter Ade, who helped build the instrument that detected the waves, told MailOnline. 'This is confirming what is, to me, a wacky idea. 'The next step is quite clear; to confirm the data with another technology.' This graphic shows the universe as it evolved from the Big Bang to now. Nasa scientists believe that the universe expanded from subatomic scales to the astronomical in just a fraction of a second after its birth . The finding by the BICEP2 telescope (pictured) in the South Pole could rank with the greatest discoveries about the universe over the last 25 years . Researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for . Astrophysics in Massachusetts built super-sensitive radiation detectors . and installed them in the BICEP2 radio telescope at the South Pole to . find these 'ripples in the sand.' Nine years later they found these . swirling patterns in cosmic background radiation created by the . gravitational waves caused by the very beginnings of the universe. Many scientists already believed that an initial, extremely rapid growth spurt happened, but finding this evidence has been a key goal in the study of the universe. The results have been described as 'spectacular', and are expected to result in a Nobel prize for the scientists . The discovery gives us a window on the universe at the very beginning when it was far less than one-trillionth of a second old. The work still has to be reviewed by other scientists, but there is already talk of a Nobel prize. 'It's what's I would term Nobel prize winning physics,' continued Professor Ade. 'Just who that prize goes to, however, will be up for debate.' Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, or CMB for short, is a faint glow of light that fills the universe. Pictured is the microwave radiation from the whole sky, captured by the European Space Agency's Planck satellite . According to Albert Einstein when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space-time known as 'gravitational waves' A telescope at the south pole, called BICEP2 (Background Imaging of cosmic Extragalactic Polarisation) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves. The instrument, which scans the sky from the South Pole, examines what is called the cosmic microwave background, the extremely weak radiation that pervades the universe. The background radiation is not precisely uniform. Like light, the relic radiation is polarised as the result of interacting with electrons and atoms in space. Computer models predicted a particular curl pattern in the background radiation that would match what would be expected with the universe's inflation after the big bang. It did this by detecting a subtle property of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This is radiation that was created in the Big Bang and originally discovered in 1964. BICEP2 measured the large-scale polarisation of this microwave radiation. Only primordial gravitational waves can imprint such a pattern, and only if they have been amplified by inflation. ‘It's just amazing,’ added theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss of Arizona State University, who was not involved in the work. ‘You can see back to the beginning of time.’ Another outside expert, physicist Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the finding already suggests that some ideas about the rapid expansion of the universe can be ruled out. Right after the Big Bang, the universe was a hot soup of particles. It took about 380,000 years to cool enough that the particles could form atoms, then stars and galaxies. Billions of years later, planets formed from gas and dust that were orbiting stars. The universe has continued to spread out. Professor Krauss said he thinks the new finding could rank with the greatest discoveries about the universe over the last 25 years, such as the Nobel prize-winning discovery that the universe's expansion is accelerating. The new results were announced by a collaboration that includes researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, the University of Minnesota, Stanford University, the California Institute of Technology and Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The team plans to submit its results to a scientific journal this week, said its leader, John Kovac of Harvard. This image shows temperature fluctuations, indicated by variations in colour, of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).  Researchers say since the CMB is a form of light, it exhibits all the properties of light, including polarisation (shown by black lines). The changes in polarisation are thought to be caused by gravitational waves . The 14-billion-year-long history of our universe. It shows the main events that occurred between the initial phase of the cosmos -- where its properties were almost uniform and punctuated only by tiny fluctuations - to the cosmic structure that we see today, ranging from stars and planets to galaxies and galaxy clusters . A telescope at the south pole, called BICEP2 (Background Imaging of cosmic Extragalactic Polarisation) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves. BICEP2 is shown here in the foreground with the South Pole Telescope in the background . For their research, astronomers scanned about two per cent of the sky for three years with a telescope at the South Pole, chosen for its very dry air, to aid in the observations. They were looking for a specific pattern in light waves within the faint microwave glow left over from the Big Bang. The pattern has long been considered evidence of the rapid growth spurt, known as inflation. Professor Kovac called it ‘the smoking gun signature of inflation.’ The scientists said the light-wave pattern was caused by gravitational waves, which are ripples in the interweaving of space and time that sprawls through the universe. The BICEP2 telescope's focal plane uses novel technology, developed at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to build an array of devices that use superconductivity to gather, filter, detect, and amplify polarised radiation from the cosmic microwave background.  Each pixel is made from a printed antenna sensitive to polarised millimeter-wave radiation . A full-sky map of the oldest light in the universe. Colors indicate 'warmer' (red) and 'cooler' (blue) spots. Nasa has called this image the best  baby picture  of the Universe ever taken . If confirmed, the new work would be the first detection of such waves from the birth of the universe, which have been called the first tremors of the Big Bang. Arizona State's Krauss cautioned that it's possible that the light-wave pattern is not a sign of inflation, although he stressed it's 'extremely likely’ that it is. It's ‘our best hope’ for a direct test of whether the rapid growth spurt happened, he added. Professor Krauss and other experts said the results must be verified by other observations - a standard caveat in science. Marc Kamionkowski, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University who didn't participate in the work, called the detection of the light-wave pattern ‘huge news’ for the study of the cosmos. ‘It's not every day you wake up and learn something completely new about the early universe,’ he said.","Using the BICEP2 telescope, scientists looked at specific patterns in light waves within the faint microwave glow left from the Big Bang .

"By . Sally Lee . One brave Australian woman has decided to share rare and terrifying insight into her abusive relationship. A video diary, documented by victim Elisha Gercovich, has been released to bring the issue of domestic abuse to the forefront. But the story doesn't end here for the mother of two, who is still currently on the run from her aggressive ex-partner Carlo Corsa. Scroll down for video . Elisha Gercovich released videos of her ex-partner Carlo Corsa breaking into her house, verbally abusing her and also images of her bruised face . The daughter of a policeman told A Current Affair that she 'had to become smarter to survive'. 'I was terrified. I had to be smarter than my perpetrator,' she said. Although Carlo pleaded guilty to numerous charges of assault, the magistrate released him after 64 days of being in remand. Now the brave mother is living out of boxes and was forced to move seven times in 21 days since she left her home in Melbourne west. She recounted the terrifying and heartbreaking moment when the physical abuse began. 'He punched me,' she said. 'All and everything I had hoped and dreamt for in this person was gone in that one punch.' The ex-partner was filmed wielding a large kitchen knife in front of the mother of two . The brave woman said she was 'heartbroken' when her partner first punched her in the face . Carlo was arrested and charged with numerous counts of assault but was released after 64 days of being in remand . One particularly chilling video shows Carlo wielding a large kitchen knife close to Elisha, seemingly unfazed that she was filming him. In another instance, the mother filmed herself locked inside a room while Corsa threatened her and tried to smash his way through the door. 'Open the f**ing door up now,' he yelled. Although it was 'love at first sight' at the beginning of the relationship, Elisa said she soon began to see signs of Corsa's true personality. 'I noticed that medications were taken, medications that I needed and required, hidden. Property was taken, my jewellery, wallet. My credit cards were snapped - that was a means of control,' she said. The abuse then began and Elisa even claims she was thrown out of his moving car. Elisha said it was 'love at first sight' whens he first met Carlo but his true self was soon revealed . The mother is now on the run with her two kids and is living out of boxes since leaving her home in Melbourne . Unfortunately, Elisha's story isn't an isolated case in Australia. One in three women experienced physical violence since the age of 15, according to an Australian Bureau of Statistic survey in 2005, while another study shows one woman is killed every week as a result of domestic violence. Elisha hopes other women will speak out against domestic violence just as she did. 'Get up, get out and go speak up,' she said. 'It's better than being dead.'

"By . Travelmail Reporter . The majority of Brits enjoy their first alcoholic drink within an hour of checking into their hotel on holiday, according to a study. Thirty-seven per cent of travellers said they only wait 60 minutes before grabbing a beer or a cocktail after arriving at their accommodation. A further 19 per cent admit to having their first ‘holiday tipple’ before they’ve even boarded their flight at the airport in the UK. Early boozers: 37 per cent of Brits enjoy a cocktail within 60 minutes of checking into a hotel . While 11 per cent of holidaymakers drink an alcoholic beverage during the flight en route to their destination, the survey by www.sunshine.co.uk revealed. The online travel agency quizzed more than 2,000 British adults who had been on holiday abroad within the past year. Nine per cent of those taking part in the poll admitted that they arrived to their last overseas holiday destination drunk, whilst 54 per cent said that they drank alcohol daily on their last holiday trip abroad. Some sixty-five per cent of travellers said they drank more alcohol in a typical week on holiday than they did when back home in the UK. Before take-off: 11 per cent of Brits have an alcoholic drink at the airport . When asked how much more, the average answer was five times more, with the average Brit spending an extra £110 on booze. Chris Clarkson, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk, said: ‘For many people, thinking of a holiday immediately conjures up images of sangria, cocktails and ice-cold beers by the pool. ‘However, it seems that drinking alcohol on holiday is a costly exercise for those who don’t have such luxuries included in the cost of their booking. ‘People should pace themselves and always drink responsibly. 'It’s easy to get carried away, but drinking alcohol in a hot climate must be done with caution as it’s likely you’ll be more dehydrated than usual. ‘Nobody wants a horrible hangover or a drunken trip to A&E when on vacation!’","19 per cent of 2,000 holidaymakers drink before they've boarded flight .

Users of The Boyfriend Log are instructed to write a brief sentence summarizing how they feel about their relationship each day, marking it green for 'amazing', orange for 'happy', blue for 'sad' and red for 'angry.' If their calendar shows more red than green, the app's creator, 49-year-old Linda Sivertsen, says it's probably time to call it quits and find someone who will have a more positive impact. Scroll down for video . Green for amazing, blue for sad: A new app allows women to assess their love life at a glance by highlighting positive and negative patterns on a color-coded calendar . The California-based mother-of-one came up with the idea for a digital love diary after her actor husband of 19 years, Mark, left her for another woman. She said over the years there were lots of signs that something was wrong, but she chose to ignore them and remember happier times. Helping others: The Boyfriend Log instructs users to rate how they feel about their relationship each day using colors - it was invented by Linda Sivertsen, 49, who was devastated when her husband of 19 years left her .

Ms Sivertsen, who also works as an author, has now been with another man for about four years - and she credits The Boyfriend Log for that relationship's success. The app took five months to produce and is now on sale on iTunes for $1.99. One happy purchaser said: 'I’m a person who needs visual proof in order for my mind to accept something - and potentially change it. 'This app does that in a way that makes things very clear. And using it is really easy. Thank you for making it!'

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Martin Kaymer believes he is a better player now than when he was world No 1, but the German is desperate to match his nation's football team in managing expectations. Germany's form in recent championships has made them one of the favourites for this summer's World Cup in Brazil, while Kaymer re-emerged as a major force with his victory in the Players Championship a fortnight ago. The 29-year-old won the US PGA Championship in August 2010 and became world number one for eight weeks the following February, but believes changes to his swing have finally bedded in. Wentworth preparation: Former world number one Martin Kaymer has been in fine form in recent months . 'I can hit any shot that I want to hit, which is important, and I didn't believe that I could do it when I was number one in the world or even when I won the PGA Championship,' Kaymer told a pre-tournament press conference ahead of the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. 'It was very easy for me to play golf, but it was not satisfying. So now I would say I'm a more complete player. But it's very important that we don't put it in the wrong perspective now that I should play well every week. 'Obviously golf is a very difficult sport and a very important word is the expectations that a lot of people have. As a player I know where I can rank my expectations. 'It's just important that others don't always think that we have to deliver every single week. The German national team are going to play the World Cup in a few weeks and when I play with different players every week everyone says, ""Oh yeah, Germany should win"". 'That's a good possibility, but it doesn't mean that we have to win or that you don't keep the expectations low. You can only get disappointed otherwise and there's a lot of pressure that those players have to handle. I think that's what people forget sometimes. It's not that easy.' Similar expectations: Kaymer believes he needs to prepare himself in a similar way mentally to the German team . Kaymer's victory at Sawgrass certainly was not achieved easily, at least after the 90-minute rain delay late in the final round. The Ryder Cup star looked to be cruising to victory until that point, but double-bogeyed the 15th when play resumed and had to hole from 30 feet for a vital par on the 17th to cling onto a one-shot lead. However, the manner of his triumph in golf's so-called 'fifth major' might actually work to his advantage in future. 'I'm sure if we would have just kept playing without the break I would have done better, but at the end of the day it worked out great for me,' Kaymer added. 'The way I won takes a lot out of yourself, but gives you a belief that you can do it any time. Those (last) three holes, it's just about how much you want it. 'It's not so much about playing good golf or playing bad golf. It's just about the will. You play with your heart and try to bring it home, and it's how much you want to win that tournament.' Kaymer is among a star-studded field at Wentworth, with only Graeme McDowell missing from the victorious Ryder Cup team of 2012 after opting to spend time at home with his pregnant wife. Victory: Kaymer won the Players Championship at Sawgrass nine days ago . France's Victor Dubuisson, who looks certain to make his Ryder Cup debut in September, is also absent with a shoulder injury, but Sweden's Jonas Blixt - who was joint second in the Masters last month - will get his first taste of the European Tour's flagship event. Blixt admits he has few memories of the tournament or the course - 'I used to watch more ice hockey than golf,' he said - but insists he would consider adding more European Tour events to his schedule if he was close to qualifying for Gleneagles. 'If I'm on the brink of maybe making one of the spots off the money list or the world ranking list, absolutely,' said Blixt, who has to play a total of 13 European Tour events to be eligible for the team. 'It's tight when you play two tours. My schedule is pretty much set for the rest of the year. Unless I get hurt or anything like that, I'm planning on playing (my 13 events).' Tough competition: Matteo Manassero admits he doesn't necessarily deserve to make the Ryder Cup team . Defending champion Matteo Manassero was tipped for a Ryder Cup place after his victory 12 months ago, but the Italian admits he would not be disappointed to miss out after struggling to reproduce such form since. 'The 12 guys that are going to make that team deserve to be on that team,' the 21-year-old said. 'It's not something that I will have thrown away. 'The beginning is always really important. If you can start well then you only need one step to get in. Now it's almost as if I need two steps to get in. It's a little bit harder so if I make it it's going to be a great achievement and I will be extremely happy about it.'","Martin Kaymer aiming to manage high expectations after Sawgrass win .

"By . Sam Webb . A Russian aircraft carrier and and a nuclear-powered battle cruiser have passed through the English Channel - escorted by a British warship. The seven-strong naval task group led by the Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia's largest warship, entered the Channel last night, a Royal Navy spokesman said. Although the ships did not enter UK territorial waters, their movements were tracked by the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Dragon - the duty fleet-ready escort vessel - which was dispatched from Portsmouth. Scroll down for video . Escort: HMS Dragon (foreground) with the Russian aircraft carrier 'Admiral Kuznetsov', in the English Channel. HMS Dragon tracked and met up with a Russian task group off the coast of Brest as they entered the English Channel yesterday . Watching: HMS Dragon, a Type 45 destroyer and one of the Royal Navy's most technically advanced warships, was able to pinpoint and monitor the movement of the seven-strong group as it approached the UK . The military manoeuvre came on the same day as president Vladimir Putin oversaw nuclear test launches in Russia. Three inter-continental ballistic missiles were launched at test sites in the remote east of Russia, in what the military said was a test run for massive nuclear retaliation should Russia or its allies be attacked. The ships, which are currently being escorted by the Navy, are believed to have been returning to the Baltic after manoeuvres in the Mediterranean. They are headed for a naval base in Severomorsk in the north-west of Russia. It is not unusual for Russian warships to pass through the Channel - the same group went through in the opposite direction in December. At no point have the ships entered the UK's territorial waters - which extend 12 nautical miles from the coast of the country. However, according to a UN treaty on sea passage, there is no reason military vessels should not be allowed through so long as they do not threaten the peace or security of a country. The Voice of Russia website - which often carries details of Russian naval movements - reported last month that they were due to return. However the latest passage took place against the backdrop of heightened tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine. A Royal Navy spokesman said: 'We can confirm that HMS Dragon was activated as the fleet-ready escort vessel. She met the task group centred around the Admiral Kuznetsov.' HMS Dragon (background) with the Russian Kirov Class battlecruiser 'Pyotr Velikiy' HMS Dragon (right) with the Russian Ropucha Class Landing Ship 'Minsk' (left), in the English Channel . Mark Francois, Minister for the Armed Forces, said: 'This routine action by HMS Dragon, in her capacity as the Fleet Ready Escort, once again underlines the professionalism and credibility of the Royal Navy in keeping the whole of the UK secure at and from the sea.' Captain Rex Cox, commanding officer of HMS Dragon said: 'Following our recent activation HMS Dragon has once more monitored a Russian task group through the UK's areas of interest. This is very much routine business both for HMS Dragon and for the Royal Navy. 'What is different here is that a Russian task group of this size has not passed by our shores in some time. Cutting edge, extremely capable and very versatile, a Type 45 Destroyer, such as HMS Dragon, is the ideal ship for the job.' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the deployment of HMS Dragon was part of a pre-planned operation. 'The decision was taken about 10 days ago when we first knew of the Kuznetsov's planned route. These movements are pre-planned. We are notified of them in advance,' he said at a Westminster lunch for political journalists. Pride of the navy: The above two photographs show former Russian president (now prime minister) Dmitri Medvedev inspecting the Admiral Kuznetsov in 2008 . Once the ships spotted each other they briefly sailed close by as a standard 'meet and greet' He said that HMS Dragon had taken over from a French destroyer which tracked the Russian flotilla through the Bay of Biscay and would hand over to a Norwegian warship. While he stressed that the passage of the Russian ships was 'routine business' for the Navy, he said there had been a resurgence of Russian military air activity in recent years. He said that was a reflection of something which a lot of people have chosen to miss, which is that Russia has been investing very substantially for many years in renewing its fleets, rebuilding its military capability. 'Russia is a very significant military power and that is something which all too often seems to get forgotten.' HMS Dragon is the fourth of six Type 45 Destroyers which have entered service over the past five years – the most advanced warships the nation has ever built. Surveillance: Planes were launched by the RAF to determine the identity of two unknown aircraft seen approaching the NATO Air Policing Area north of Scotland. They were identified as Russian Tu-95s . In April an RAF Typhoon closed in on a Russian surveillance plane after it flew close to UK airspace, before making it turn back. A photograph of the Russian Tu-95 'Bear H' was taken from one of the RAF's Quick Reaction Aircraft after two Russian planes were spotted off the coast of north-east Scotland. However, the aircraft turned away after the British jet fighters, one which can be seen approaching the Russian plane from above, took off from Leuchars airbase, near St Andrews in Fife. Planes were launched by the RAF to determine the identity of two unknown aircraft seen approaching the NATO Air Policing Area north of Scotland, which could not be identified by other means. The aircraft were later identified as Russian Bears, which the Ministry of Defence said remained in international airspace, as they are entitled to do.

"By . Lillian Radulova . Australian children are among the least active in the world, ranking behind those in the UK, Europe, Africa and South America, according to a major international study taken across 15 countries. The Active Healthy Kids study reveals just 20 per cent of the Australia’s children aged between five and 17 get 60 minutes of exercise per day. It means four out of five Australian children are failing to meet the government's recommended physical activity guidelines. Australia's children were given a D- for Overall Physical Activity as part of a study which ranked 15 of the world's countries by the physical activity of their children . The report, which surveyed 15,000 people, also revealed that more than 70 per cent of Australian children spend two hours a day or more in front of an electronic screen. The study looked at the daily physical activity of children from 15 countries. After combining data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the National Secondary Student's Diet and Activity survey, researchers scored Australia a D- for overall physical activity, . For Sedentary Behaviors, or screen time, Australia also received a D-, while Active Transportation received a D. In the Family and Peers category which looks into positive exercise influences, Australia received a C while Government Strategies and Investments received a C+. More... Are YOU stressed at work?

But experts warn Australia's participation in organised sport is simply not enough. The report's lead author and research associate at the University of South Australia, Natasha Schranz, said the results prove Australia has 'fallen behind'. 'It's alarming that a nation committed to sport has fallen so far behind in incidental activity,' Dr Schranz told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'We are just shutting it out. We need to do more active transport, reduce sitting and television time and incorporate active play into everyday life.' The Active Healthy Kids Australia report card found that more than 80 per cent of Australia's children failed to get the recommended 60 minutes of exercise a day . Heart Foundation physical activity spokesman, Trevor Shilton, said the study’s results need to be taken seriously as the potential health implications could be disastrous for Australian children in the future . 'We're raising a generation of couch potatoes,' he said, recommending that schools introduce 2½ hours of mandatory physical education a week. 'Far too many kids are being driven to school and spend most of their time sitting when they get there. There is nothing inherent in children that makes them sedentary, which makes this very worrisome.' Australia's report card reveals that, while we rank well in some areas, we lag behind the rest of the world in others .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A Cornell-educated artist and sculptor has come up with a highly bizarre, but probably very effective, 'personal space' creating dress. Kathleen McDermott, who is currently based in Hong Kong, designed the motorized dress after experiencing repeated instances of men crowding her on public transportation networks. The ruffled pink and white creation doesn't spring out suddenly in the fashion of an umbrella, as it looks like it might, but rather senses a looming presence, and slowly expands outwards. Ta-da! Artist Kathleen McDermott has created a personal space creating dress, which expands to ward off strangers who lurk too close . 'I wanted to explore how wearable technology could impact a person's physical world,' she writes on her website, Kthartic. 'So I began to look for ways women could take more ownership over their personal space in public.' Ms McDermott built the dress herself and used 'proximity sensors' to identify when a lurker gets too close for comfort, and plastic scaffolding within the garment to enable the hemline to expand. Stay away! Ms McDermott's dress may be 'playful' but sexual harassment is no joke, with cases on public transport networks frequently reported all over the world . The artist points out that women in particular tend to experience the matter of personal space very differently, according to their age, race or social standing for example. 'How would [different types of women] use technology to augment their experience of public space, given the opportunity?' she poses. While she admits her 'personal space dress' is a 'playful' creation, the sexual harassment of women who ride mass transit is no joke. Geek chic: The dress is triggered to expand by 'proximity sensors' built within the garment, not in an umbrella-quick motion, but rather a slow, gentle extension . Most of us have experienced unwanted leering on the subway, but plenty have dealt with worse in busy, thriving cities around the world. A survey two weeks ago conducted by the Los Angeles Metro system, which covers trains and buses, revealed that one in five riders say they've been sexually harassed in the past month. In Tokyo, the problem has become so alarming that their Metro system has introduced 'women-only' cars on their trains during rush hour. Inventive: The American artist, who is currently . a student at Hong Kong's City University, says she wanted to explore . 'how wearable technology could impact a person's psychical world' Indeed, The New York Times reported a major New York transit hearing in 2009, which found that sexual harassment is the number one offense which 'affects the quality of urban life' on subways. Police said the peak times for those arrests was during morning and afternoon rush hours. Ms McDermott's dress, while comical to behold and admittedly entirely impractical, was designed more to establish a point than to actually manufacture and sell. 'I wanted to explore how wearable technology could impact a person's physical world' Long-term, she says she wants this dress, and other similar pieces, to be become 'instructables' - to exist in an online library whereby anyone can download the instructions and tech code, and build one themselves, for whatever reason. Other wacky 'wearable electronics' she has created as part of her growing Urban Armour project, include a scarf with a built-in pollution sensor; which pops up to form a protective filter against cigarette smoke or car exhaust fumes. Ms McDermott is currently pursuing a Masters in Fine Art and Creative Media, at City University of Hong Kong.","The 'playful' dress is triggered by sensors when someone strays too close .

"By . Sam Webb . A father has posted a photo on Gumtree of the remains of his 17-year-old son's smashed car to shame him into driving more carefully. Steve Clark, from Monikie, Angus, advertised the wrecked 14-year-old Honda Civic 1.4 for sale for one penny - adding a picture of the vehicle on its roof. He said he wanted to 'embarrass' his son and to make other parents aware of their children's driving habits. The car Steve Clark put up for sale online after his son was involved in an accident. He wanted to shame the teenager into driving more carefully . Mr Clark said he wanted to 'embarrass' his son and to make other parents aware of their children's driving habits . Nathanial Clark, 17, rolled the 1.4 litre motor on a bend near his home. Luckily he walked away from the wreck with no physical injuries . He wrote on the ad: 'Due to son thinking he's Colin McRae, I now have a 2000 Honda Civic 1.4 breaking for spares. 'It seems a 1.4 was to much for him to handle. He talked the talk, but certainly didn't walk the walk - he will be walking now, for a long time. 'If only all roads were straight, we as parents wouldn't have to worry about our over-enthusiastic sons. 'It seems his ambition outweighed his talent on this occasion. I can't think why! he's been driving for over a week now... 'One FOC (free of charge) 17-year-old boy, complete with black eye - not from accident, administered by myself!' The car before it was in the accident. Mr Clark said: 'He talked the talk, but certainly didn't walk the walk - he will be walking now, for a long time' Mr Clark,  55, a former administration manager of a skip hire company, said today that he feared that if his son, Nathaniel, continued to drive so badly, 'he won't see 18'. Nathaniel, an apprentice with commercial vehicle dealers AM Phillip in Forfar, was driving home from work only nine days after passing his driving test   when he lost control taking a corner too fast. Mr Clark said he had hoped that his son would be more careful on the road after previously warning him of the dangers of driving, and also due to his   experience with off-road motorcycles. He said: 'His mother took the initial phone call when we found out he had been in a car accident. 'She was devastated. She handed the telephone to me shaking and crying, saying that he was on his roof. The father has received floods of messages of support from other parents of young drivers for his actions. 'I knew straight away who and what she was talking about.' He added: He wasn't hurt, which is a Godsend. Obviously our first concern was for his health as the car can be replaced, probably at a later date.' Mr Clark said he liked 'to do things outside of the box' and felt that posting the advert online was the best way to shame his son. He said he and his wife Lorraine have received floods of messages of support from other parents of young drivers for his actions. 'The support I have had from other parents and drivers has been overwhelming,' he said. 'It was mainly just to shock people and let people know what happens out there when their kids go for a drive; how hard it is for us parents to sit at   home waiting on a dreaded phone call or wondering if they're going to come home in one piece.' Mr Clark said he had hoped that his son would be more careful on the road because of his experience with off-road motorcycles . Nathanial's brother, Nicholas, 27, showed Nathanial the advert five hours after it was posted. Mr Clark described his son as 'shocked' and 'mortified'. He added: 'I can't believe that a daft wee advert has attracted so much attention.'  Nathanial passed his test on the 1st of May 2014 and his mother and father paid for the car. The crash took place on the Bonnyton Road between Forfar and Monikie on Satuday May 10 at 12.30pm. Mr Clark said that since the advert was posted on Monday, he had received many informal   offers including someone offering a packet of biscuits for the remains of the vehicle. He has also had two formal offers, one of £250 and another of £370 for the remains.","Steve Clark posted picture of wrecked Honda Civic on its roof on website .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Neelam Desai, 33, was sentenced to 30 months in prison after admitting to a string of offences including a £230,000 fraud . A serial conwoman behind a £230,000 fraud who used the police to try and protect herself from press exposure was today jailed for 30 months. Bankrupt Neelam Desai was sentenced after admitting to a string of offences, including setting up a bogus travel agency as part of a ‘ponzi’ scheme which left one victim more £150,000 out of pocket. The 33-year-old juggled a number of cons, some of them carried out while serving a suspended sentence for an earlier rip-off, and tried to pay off hundreds of thousands in debts using her oblivious mother’s chequebook. She is also currently under investigation for a serious identity fraud scam, where one Leicestershire businessman lost £35,000 and his business. Prosecutor Kathryn Pitters told Croydon Crown Court how huge amounts of money had been taken from customers for package holidays that never materialised. When the con began to unravel she forged stolen cheques and resorted to trying to sell phantom iPhones over the internet charging upto £300 for mobiles that were never delivered. Desai’s rackets began in in 2008 when she set up a travel agency operated out her home targetting wealthy members of the Asian community. Mrs Pitters said: 'The deals were extraordinary in their scope and attracted a great deal of interest. Those deals were, however, too good to be true - they were so heavily discounted, that it was simply impossible for the defendant to deliver on the deals that she offered.' When she began to run out of money to keep the con afloat she appealed to wealthy businessman Dhanji Asani, who had booked flights for himself, family and friends through her, for a loan. He forked out over £175,000 in a number of payments to Desai, who said she was 'broke' but promised to pay back £180,000, although he only received a fraction after a £150,000 repayment failed to materialise. Mrs Pitters said: 'The cheques bounced - as the defendant knew they would when she wrote them, and the victim went to the police.' She was later convicted of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception on February 2010 and handed a nine-month suspended sentence. She had secured to loans against her mother’s home without her knowledge - which she never repaid. While on bail, Desai petitioned for bankruptcy and was banned from running a business. Reporter Gareth Davies received this letter from police after the con woman alleged he was harassing her . But she continued to sell cheap tickets under a fake name, Nisha Patel, despite serving a suspended sentence, propping the con up with stolen chequebooks. Desai, of Selhurst, South London, admitted nine charges in total, including five counts of fraud, three counts of handling stolen goods and one count of engaging in business while bankrupt in March. She is also under investigation by the police after further allegations of fraud emerged last month while awaiting sentence. It is claimed Desai stole thousands in a honeypot fraud that targeted users of an Asian online dating site, which was exposed by a local paper last month. She allegedly set up a fake profile on the marriage website, shaadi.com, using the photograph of an attractive marketing manager stolen from Facebook . One of her alleged victims, a 35-year-old from Leicester, claims he lost his business after being conned out of £35,500. But a reporter sent to challenge Desai, 33, was himself handed a written warning by police for allegedly ‘harassing’ the criminal. Croydon Advertiser Senior Reporter, Gareth Davies, 29, was served with a letter by three uniformed officers . Despite protesting that he was just doing his job, he was told by an officer: 'You say you were just doing your job, but that’s what the News of the World and the phone hackers said.' Jailing her at Croydon Crown Court today, Judge Stephen Waller said her con had netted unwary holidaymakers out for a deal with prices that were 'too good to be true' and left it impossible to run the business. She tried to keep the business going by taking her victims’ money to pay for new customers, which was 'effectively a Ponzi scheme', he said. Desai was given a 27 month sentence, with an additional three months to be served consecutively for breaching her previous order. A confiscation hearing is expected to take place in July. Speaking outside the court, Detective Counstable Lee Haslett said: 'People need to consider that if an offer seems to good to be true then generally they are. 'Everyone is looking out for a bargain, but they need to be aware of what they are getting themselves into. 'This is a fair sentence, obviously it affected quite a number of people and I’m aware that there is another ongoing investigation.' Prosecutors agreed that seven other counts of fraud on the indictment, six concerning cheques and one to an iPhone will remain on file.","Neelam Desai, 33, jailed after admitting a string of offences .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A secretive Chinese military unit is . believed to be behind a series of hacking attacks on the U.S. government as well as aerospace, . communications and energy companies, a report claimed today. U.S. security firm Mandiant has identified the People's Liberation Army's . Shanghai-based Unit 61398 as the most likely driving force behind hundreds, if not thousands of cyber attacks. It said says the office block is linked to stolen technology blueprints, manufacturing processes, clinical trial results, pricing documents, negotiation strategies and other secret data from more than 100 companies. More alarmingly, it claims the unit, known as the Comment Crew, has also made incursions into the computer networks that control oil pipelines, power grids, water plants and other pieces of key state infrastructure. 'Source of attacks': Unit 61398 is located in Shanghai's Pudong district and is staffed by perhaps thousands of people proficient in English as well as computer programming and network operations, the report said . Ground zero: The building, used by the People's Liberation Army, is located on the outskirts of Shanghai . 'The nature of Unit 61398's work is considered by China to be a state secret,' Mandiant said in a report released in the United States. 'However, we believe it engages in harmful ""Computer Network Operations"". 'It . is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China and we wanted . to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that . threat effectively,' it said. The Chinese Foreign Ministry today dismissed the report as 'groundless' and said the government firmly opposed hacking. 'Hacking . attacks are transnational and anonymous. Determining their origins are . extremely difficult. We don't know how the evidence in this so-called . report can be tenable,' spokesman Hong Lei told a daily news briefing. 'Arbitrary criticism based on rudimentary data is irresponsible, unprofessional and not helpful in resolving the issue.' Prolific: The unit, known as Comment Crew, is alleged to have stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organisations across a diverse set of industries beginning as early as 2006 . Denial: The Chinese Foreign Ministry today dismissed the report as 'groundless' and said the government firmly opposed hacking . Hong cited a Chinese study which pointed to the United States as being behind hacking in China. 'Of the above mentioned Internet hacking attacks, attacks originating from the United States rank first.' China's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to faxed questions about the report. Unit . 61398 is located in Shanghai's Pudong district, China's financial and . banking hub and is staffed by perhaps thousands of people proficient in . English as well as computer programming and network operations, Mandiant . said in its report. The . unit had stolen 'hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 . organisations across a diverse set of industries beginning as early as . 2006', it said. Some 115 of the victims were located in the United States, with smaller numbers in Canada and Britain. The information stolen ranged from details on mergers and acquisitions to the emails of senior employees, the company said. Guarded: The company traced Unit 61398's presence on the Internet, including numeric web addresses within a block assigned to the PLA unit . Such is the fear of China's cyber weaponry, American companies have been warned not to do business with two of its leading technology firms because they pose a national security threat. The House Intelligence Committee said in a report in October that U.S. regulators should block mergers and acquisitions in the country by Huawei Technologies Ltd and ZTE Corp, which are among the world's leading suppliers of telecommunications gear and mobile phones. Two weeks earlier, the White House revealed that cyber attackers linked to the Chinese government attempted to hack into a computer system in the White House Military Office. While the official statement down played the attack, one report claimed that the hackers targeted the hardware which safeguards sensitive data like the nuclear launch codes. The . state-run Medicaid system in Utah was also hacked last year, prompting calls . for tightened security around any government health databases that . would be implemented in accordance with the Affordable Care Act. While attacks on state infrastructure poses the greatest risk, the effect cyber warfare in the private sector can also be catastrophic. In November 2011, the National Counterintelligence Committee released a report detailing the extent of damage done by Chinese and Russian hackers on various companies. One . example was that of a paint company called Valspar Corportation, which . had a number of its proprietary paint formulas stolen. The move cost the . company $20million. Foxconn, . a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that produces products sold in . America including iPhones, was hacked in February by a group called . Swagg Security which then obtained and released the email and credit . card data for banking information for American companies including Apple . and Microsoft. Some experts said they doubted Chinese government denials. 'The . PLA plays a key role in China's multi-faceted security strategy, so it . makes sense that its resources would be used to facilitate economic . cyber espionage that helps the Chinese economy,' said Dmitri . Alperovitch, chief technology officer and co-founder of CrowdStrike, one . of Mandiant's competitors. Though . privately held and little known to the general public, Mandiant is one . of a handful of U.S. cyber-security companies that specialise in . attempting to detect, prevent and trace the most advanced hacking . attacks, instead of the garden-variety viruses and criminal intrusions . that befoul corporate networks on a daily basis. But . Mandiant does not promote its analysis in public and only rarely issues . topical papers about changes in techniques or behaviours. It . has never before given the apparent proper names of suspected hackers . or directly tied them to a military branch of the Chinese government, . giving the new report special resonance. The . company published details of the attack programmes and dummy websites . used to infiltrate U.S. companies, typically via deceptive emails. U.S. officials have complained in the past to China about sanctioned . trade-secret theft, but have had a limited public record to point to. Mandiant . said it knew the PLA would shift tactics and programmes in response to . its report, but concluded that the disclosure was worth it because of . the scale of the harm and the ability of China to issue denials in the . past and duck accountability. The . company traced Unit 61398's presence on the Internet - including . registration data for a question-and-answer session with a Chinese . professor and numeric Internet addresses within a block assigned to the . PLA unit - and concluded that it was a major contributor to operations . against the U.S. companies. Members . of Congress and intelligence authorities in the United States have . publicised the same general conclusions: that economic espionage is an . official mission of the PLA and other elements of the Chinese . government, and that hacking is a primary method. In . November 2011, the U.S. National Counterintelligence Executive publicly . decried China in particular as the biggest known thief of U.S. trade . secrets. The Mandiant report . comes a week after U.S. President Barack Obama issued a long-awaited . executive order aimed at getting the private owners of power plants and . other critical infrastructure to share data on attacks with officials . and to begin to follow consensus best practices on security. Both . U.S. Democrats and Republicans have said more powerful legislation is . needed, citing Chinese penetration not just of the largest companies but . of operations essential to a functioning country, including those . comprising the electric grid.","Targets include aerospace, communications and energy companies .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has shrugged off the limitations of a £49million transfer cap by revealing that the new Premier League champions are well on the way to landing their summer transfer targets. City want to sign defender Bacary Sagna on a free transfer from Arsenal and retain a strong interest in £35m-rated FC Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala and his teammate Fernando despite an UEFA punishment for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations. As well as having their net spending capped, City's wage bill has also been frozen although £200,000-a-week will be freed up after Khaldoon confirmed that Gareth Barry and Joleon Lescott are not being offered new contracts. Quick mover: Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak tells fans they'll move quickly with transfers . Future starts now: Al Mubarak (left) says the club knows who they want and who they don't . On the move? City is targeting Arsenal's FA Cup-winning defender Bacary Sagna for a move across London . In demand: Porto's Eliaquim Mangala is rated at £35m but still a primary focus for the Premier League Champions . Under pressure: City financial constraints haven't dampened their interest in Fernando, also from Porto . After stealing a march on their rivals . by spending nearly £100m on Fernandinho, Jesus Navas, Alvaro Negredo . and Stevan Jovetic last summer, the City chief promised that they will . not waste any time again now. He said: 'Expect the same - but even earlier. 'Today . I can tell you we know exactly what needs to be done, we know exactly . the players that need to go and the players that need to come to the . areas that need to be strengthened. 'So . I can tell our fans: expect an efficient and swift execution plan and . we will have, after the World Cup, a good pre-season and will go into . the season very ready as we did last year ready to compete in four all . four competitions.' City's actions last summer, including the . sacking of Roberto Mancini as manager, put the club back on an upward . trajectory after a relatively disappointing end to the 2012-13 season. Al Mubarak reported that owner Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi has been delighted with progress in the past 12 months. Moving on: Al Mubarak (right), with Sheikh Mansour (left) and Vincent Kompany, says FFP restrictions of £49m will have 'no material impact' on their plans . Paint it blue: Manchester's Albert Square is covered in confetti as fans celebrate the Premier League glory . He said: 'Sheikh Mansour feels this club . is doing exactly what he intended it to do in terms of performance . across the board - on the field, off field, trophies, championships and . wins, but also commercial success, and the fans' support has been . unwavering. 'Genuinely, Sheikh Mansour is absolutely delighted with the way this club, this company, this business is performing.' City did attract criticism after parting company with Mancini, as the Italian had led the club to their first title in 44 years in 2012. But Manuel Pellegrini has proved a popular, reliable and successful replacement and the club feel their decision has been vindicated. Al Mubarak said: 'The decision to hire Pellegrini was a very important decision for us as we look at the next couple of years. 'I am absolutely delighted for him, for the fans, for the club, for everyone involved at Manchester City. 'It is a perfectly justified decision. I think the results speak for themselves.' Leadership: Manager Manuel Pellegrini and Vincent Kompany pose after a job well done . Justified: The results of the season validate City's choice to replace Roberto Mancini with Pellegrini . One of the next targets for City will be to carry their domestic pre-eminence onto the European stage. Some progress on this front has been made under Pellegrini, with the club reaching the Champions League knockout stage for the first time. Al Mubarak said: 'This year we have made some progress. We have played much better football, been a lot more competitive and I think the experience coming through the two games against Barcelona will be invaluable for us. 'Let's be clear - Europe has always been an integral part of our strategy, an integral part of the success we want to achieve for this club. We will continue to progress.' Al Mubarak also paid tribute to two City players who are now out of contract in Joleon Lescott and Gareth Barry and are set to leave this summer. Defender Lescott, signed from Everton in an acrimonious £22million deal in 2009, played a key role in the 2012 title win. Moved on: Former Everton defender Joleon Lescott (right) hasn't been retained by City . Tribute: As with Lescott, Al Mubarak thanked Gareth Barry for his services to City after a year's loan at Everton . Al Mubarak said: 'He is a wonderful man. He has served this club loyally and he has had some of his best performances in his career here at Manchester City. 'I look back at the challenge when we first brought Joleon in and the reaction he had at Everton. It was a tough time for him but I am really happy for him. He came here and had a wonderful career. 'We will miss him and I really want to thank him for all his efforts.' Barry, who also joined the club in 2009, enjoyed four good seasons in the City midfield before joining Everton on loan last summer. Al Mubarak said: 'Gareth is another one of those wonderful players that made a big career decision when he decided to join City. 'He was a loyal player in our squad, fully committed to our cause, had some phenomenal performances. 'He really was a great player for Manchester City. I really want to wish him all the best going forward.'","Arsenal's Bacary Sagna along with Porto's Eliaquim Mangala and Fernando are among City's primary summer transfer targets .

"By . Richard Spillett . Rich foreigners are queuing up to buy property in a £100million block of flats which boasts David Cameron and the Queen among the neighbours. The former European Council for Foreign Relations in Westminster, central London, is set to be transformed into luxury properties, which developers expect to fetch around £5million each when sold. The flats, at 29-35 Old Queen Street, will be the closest residential addresses to the Prime Minister and Chancellor's official homes in Downing Street. The former European Council for Foreign Relations in Westminster is to be transformed into a £100 million block of luxury flats . A computer-generated vision of how the flats' interiors will look. Each property is expected to sell for between £1.5million and £5million - meaning the building's residents will pay a combined £7million in stamp duty . Developers expect most of the luxury flats to be bought off-plan by super-rich Middle Eastern Asian and Russian buyers before the project is completed . Residents of the building, dubbed 'mini Hyde Park One' after London's current most-exclusive address, will be handing over a combined £7 million to their government neighbours in stamp duty tax. Despite their multi-million pound price-tags, the flats are expected to be snapped up before they are finished by foreign buyers who want to live on the doorstep of Downing Street. Galliard Homes today confirmed they have now been granted planning permission for the transformation. They will be converting the 27,190 sq/ft building into 22 one, two and three bedroom apartments, including duplexes and penthouses. The building will include a rooftop garden and marble entrance foyer with concierge. Flats will cost from £1.6 to £5 million with the architects Squire and Partners behind the design. It is . anticipated the apartments will be sold off-plan before the project is . completed by super-wealthy Middle East, Asian and Russian buyers, . according to Galliard. The properties, which have just been given planning permission, have been dubbed 'mini Hyde Park One', after London's most-exclusive address . The luxury flats, on Old Queen Street, Westminster, will be just a stone's throw from Downing Street, Whitehall and Buckingham Palace . The new residences will be set over nine floors and range from 527 sq/ft up to 1,518 sq/ft in size . Stephen . Conway, chief executive of Galliard Homes, said: 'Our Squire & . Partners project is the most luxurious residential development . undertaken to date in Westminster and will help to raise residential . values in the district to be in line with neighbouring Mayfair and . Marylebone. 'Prime London residential values have overtaken commercial, and this means that the West End, Westminster and Whitehall is rapidly transforming from being dominated by offices into addresses associated with London’s most luxurious new residences and 5 star hotels. 'This project is the latest part in this ongoing evolution and we anticipate strong sales interest in the scheme.' Built in the early 1900s, 29-35 Old Queen Street originally provided grand mansions lived in by Westminster politicians and wealthy merchants. After the Second World War, the building was converted into offices and served as the London headquarters of the European Council for Foreign Relations. Galliard Homes acquired the freehold of the building and recently applied for planning permission for a change of use back to residential. Set over nine floors, the new residences will range from 527 sq/ft up to 1,518 sq/ft in size. It is expected they will cost in excess of £3,000 per sq/ft, setting a new record in the area.

"By . Associated Press . A millionaire former boyfriend who's now bankrolling ads against her opponent called the police last year on Monica Wehby, the leading Republican candidate in Oregon's U.S. Senate race, and accused her of stalking him as their relationship broke up. Timber company executive Andrew Miller told a Portland police officer on April 4, 2013, that Wehby 'had been ""harassing"" his employees and ""stalking"" him,' according to a report the officer filed. Wehby is a pediatric neurosurgeon and the front-runner in next week's GOP primary. Miller is one of two donors to a super PAC (political action committee) attacking Wehby's rival, state Representative Jason Conger. Senate hopeful: Monica Wehby, the leading Republican in the Oregon Senate race, was once accused by a former boyfriend of stalking . Political rival: Jason Conger says Wehby's behavior will make voters doubt her judgement . Miller said Friday his description of Wehby's behavior was 'excessively embellished.' He said emotions were running high at the end of their relationship and he regrets calling police. 'I made a mistake at a moment in time in terms of how I handled something, and I probably, in hindsight, wish I'd handled it a little differently,' Miller said. Wehby did not address the issue in a debate with Conger in Portland on Friday, and she ignored questions from reporters as she and her staff left out a side door. Embellished: Wehby's former boyfriend Andrew Miller has since admitted that he exaggerated her behavior and shouldn't have called the police . 'A year ago I went through the process of concluding a relationship,' Wehby said in a statement released by her campaign. 'That relationship ended amicably, and while I'm not pleased that it has been deemed newsworthy, I guess that is the cost of challenging the political status quo.' Conger chided Wehby for refusing to answer questions, and said Republicans shouldn't nominate a candidate with controversy that can be exploited by Democrats. 'I think it will create serious questions about her judgment in the minds of voters,' Conger told reporters. One in 5 registered Republicans has already returned their ballot in Oregon's mail-only election, which will temper any impact on the primary. Wehby has excited Republicans in Washington, who are impressed by her resume and are hopeful she can raise enough money to make her competitive against Democratic incumbent Jeff Merkley, despite Republicans' longstanding struggles to win statewide races in Oregon. Authorities got involved when Miller called police to say Wehby wouldn't leave his house, according to the report. An officer spotted Wehby's Mercedes leaving Miller's neighborhood and pulled her over. She told the officer she'd been in a . relationship with Miller for two years but that something changed over . the weekend and he'd stopped talking to her or returning her calls, . according to the police report. She said she'd visited his house, and . when he didn't answer, entered through an unlocked back door. The . officer told her to go home and not to return to Miller's home unless . she was invited. Atonement: Wehby's ex-boyfriend is now bankrolling a campaign against her rival . The officer then called Miller, who said Wehby came to his home uninvited 'about five times in the last 10 days,' and the last several times he watched her knock on the doors and ring the doorbell repeatedly for about 10 minutes before leaving, according to the report. On the day he called police, he said he heard her enter the back door and go upstairs, so he used a different staircase to leave. Miller, chief executive of Stimson Lumber, is a prolific donor to Republican candidates in Oregon. He gave $30,000 to a super PAC called 'If He Votes Like That In Salem Imagine What He Will Do In Congress,' which has attacked Conger in radio ads, mailers and billboards, saying he voted with Democrats on key issues important to Republicans. Miller said he and Wehby remain friends but their relationship is over.","Monica Wehby is the leading Republican candidate in Orgeon's Senate race .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . A Missouri death row inmate scheduled to be put to death next week has filed a motion asking that his execution be videotaped because he's afraid 'it could be painful.' Russell Bucklew, who turned 46 on Friday, is scheduled to die at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday for killing a man living with his ex-girlfriend as part of a crime spree in southeast Missouri in 1996. After the murder, Bucklew raped his ex-girlfriend and shot at a state trooper in a police chase. Scroll down for video . Convict: Russell Bucklew, pictured, wants his execution to be videotaped because he's afraid of how lethal drugs will affect his body . Victim: Michael Sanders, pictured, was shot and killed by Bucklew in front of his two sons. Stephanie Pruitt and her two daughters, who had been staying with Sanders, also witnessed the killing . Bucklew's attorneys filed a motion seen asking for the execution to be taped, citing Bucklew's health concern, Mother Jones reports. 'Mr. Bucklew seeks this Order so he can preserve vital evidence of the events occurring during his execution,' the motion says. 'His head, neck, throat and brain are filled with clumps of weak, malformed blood vessels that could rupture, causing coughing, choking and suffocation, or impairing the circulation of the lethal drug, causing a prolonged and excruciating execution while he struggles for air. Mr. Bucklew seeks to document these events.' Bucklew suffers from a congenital condition that causes the damaged blood vessels and tumors. He told AP in a phone interview Friday that he often bleeds from the eyes and ears. He has constant pain in the face that requires pain medication every six hours. In light of his condition and the botched April execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma, Bucklew said he's worried about what will happen to him. 'I'm worried it could be painful,' Bucklew said. 'I'm worried about being brain-dead. I understand the family (of the victim) wants closure, but we're victimizing my family here, too.' Bucklew's attorneys have also cited concerns about Missouri's secretive procurement of the execution drug. Lethal injection: Former Cape Girardeau county prosecutor Morley Swingle has called Bucklew a 'homicidal Energiser bunny' In March 1996, Bucklew tracked down his estranged girlfriend, Stephanie Pruitt, at the Cape Girardeau mobile home of Michael Sanders. Pruitt and her two young daughters were staying there with Sanders and his two young sons. Bucklew shot Sanders in front of Pruitt and the kids, killing him. He grabbed Pruitt, took her to a remote area, and raped her. When a Missouri state trooper spotted Bucklew later that night on Interstate 55, a chase began. Bucklew shot at the trooper and missed. The trooper shot back and grazed Bucklew's head. He later escaped from jail, hid inside the home of Pruitt's mother and attacked her with a hammer. She was able to get away and Bucklew was caught a short time later. Bucklew said he was remorseful for the crime, and said he plans to revise his will to provide money for a college fund for the sons of the victim. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, in a court response on Thursday, questioned why Bucklew waited until now to raise those concerns. 'There is no good reason Bucklew could not have brought his current suit six months ago, or six years ago,' Koster wrote. Former Cape Girardeau County . prosecutor Morley Swingle said he has no sympathy for him. He earlier referred to Bucklew as a 'homicidal Energiser bunny' when speaking to the Guardian. 'I . truly believe he's probably the most evil person I ever prosecuted . because he's such a pure sociopath,' Swingle said. 'When he had it in . his mind to hurt somebody, you just couldn't stop him.' Swingle said concerns about the pentobarbital used in the execution 'are grasping at straws. It's a very deadly poison and when they give it to him, he'll die.' Bucklew's execution would be the seventh in Missouri since November using pentobarbital, and there have been no apparent problems with the previous six. Botched execution: Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett, pictured, took 43 minutes to die after a lethal injection went awry in April . It would also be the first death penalty carried out in the U.S. since April 29, when Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett writhed on the gurney, gritted his teeth, and moaned before dying of an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after the start of his execution. A doctor inside the death chamber during the execution reported that Lockett's vein collapsed and some of the lethal drugs were absorbed into his tissue or leaked out. The incident prompted renewed concern about lethal injection in an era when many states, including Oklahoma and Missouri, have changed drugs they administer and refuse to disclose the source of the execution drugs. Oklahoma put on hold a second execution scheduled for the same night as Lockett's death, while the state investigates what happened. A Texas inmate was scheduled to be put to death this week but a federal appeals court granted a stay of execution so his attorneys can pursue appeals arguing that he is mentally impaired and ineligible for the death penalty.","Russell Bucklew, 46, tracked down his estranged girlfriend, Stephanie Pruitt, at the home of Michael Sanders in 1996 .

"By . Ashley Collman . Graduate: Cancer patient Yeatise Gaines was able to accomplish her goal of graduating high school in a special ceremony held just one day before she died . A 17-year-old Michigan cancer patient was able to achieve her goal of graduating high school in a special ceremony before she died. Kalamazoo Central High School Principal Valerie Boggan personally presented Yeatise Gaines with a cap, gown and certificate of completion at the hospital on May 14, ahead of the scheduled June 4 commencement. School administrators, teachers, and more than 20 family members gathered around Yeatise's hospital bed to celebrate her accomplishment. She passed away the next day. 'It was always something she wanted to do,' Yeatise's mother Santasha Gaines told MailOnline. 'If she made it this far she didn't want to leave this earth without the diploma in her hands.' Ms Gaines says her daughter dreamed of studying oncology in college so she could help children with cancer, just like herself. Yeatise has been battling cancer since she was just 18 months old, and it was the radiation treatment that sent her cancer into remission but weakened her lungs and ultimately killed her. The teen asked to be taken out of school for the third time after Thanksgiving, but the dedicated student continued her studies through home schooling. Her tutor, Ruby Sledge, told the Kalamazoo Gazette that she was focused girl who took school very seriously. Ms Sludge also admired the way Yeatise would stay strong even through the most painful periods of her illness. Ambitions: Yeatise wanted to become an oncologist so she could help other children with cancer. Pictured above in a photo posted on her Facebook . 'A plus on attitude': Yeatise's tutor says she never complained about her pain and was a very focused student . 'I never heard her complain,' Ms Sledge told the Gazette.  'I would give her an A plus on attitude. 'This was a case where the teacher learned from the student,' Sledge said. During her long battle with cancer, Yeatise underwent 10 surgeries, was in crutches for four years and had severe back pain. Her mother is just glad that her daughter is no longer feeling that pain. 'She's just happy now that she's with the lord,' Ms Gaines said. 'No more suffering for my daughter period. No more.'","Yeatise Gaines, who attended Kalamazoo Central High School, died on May 15 .

Witnesses say the brand-new 90-foot yacht was being launched at the Cap Sante Marina in Anacortes at about 9pm after a buyer paid at least $10 million for it. As the yacht was lowered into the water, it tilted to one side, say witnesses, and flipped over completely as it hit the water. Scroll down for video .

'The boat tilted to one side, and although not unusual, the amount of tilt was a bit more than normal,' Wes Fridell of Northern Marine told KIRO-TV. 'So we paused to collect ourselves and assure that everything was going to be right, and then as we continued to lower it down, it pitched, and that's when it went over.'

Credit Suisse pleads guilty in US tax evasion case . The main focus of the class action case was to recoup the damages allegedly caused by Endeavor Energy for the affected homeowners. 'We believe there are five to six hundred people affected and we believe that the total quantum of loss is going to be in the order of $200 million,' he told reporters . 'Quite simply, the residents of this area have suffered losses that are not their fault.' 'They are losses that would not have occurred had the right procedures been followed.' He said there is no reason these residents should sit back and just accept that this fire occurred, and pay for the damages caused.

Preventable: Residents have taken a power company to court alleging that they failed to trim a tree which may have sparked the Blue Mountains blaze . He said the class action was a secure and low-risk means for the residents and businesses affected by the fire to claim losses that insurance policies did not cover. 'We’ve successfully settled class actions for four different communities that were burnt outduring the Black Saturday bushfires of February 7 2009.' In all four cases, the fires were the result of poorly-maintained power lines, or surrounding infrastructure, combining with extreme weather conditions to ignite a fire.' In last year's fires strong winds fueled the blaze with weeks of harrowing conditions adding to its ferocity in the Winmalee and Springwood regions. There were a number of other, smaller fires which broke out across NSW, but it was the Blue Mountains blaze which caused the most heartache for residents - destroying about 200 homes and damaging a further 200 more. Residents banded together in the days during and after the blaze to help with the massive cleanup - estimated to cost more than $100 million.

It led Former Premier Barry O'Farrell to declare a state of emergency for the region, and the state's fire boss, Shane Fitzsimmons, called it an unparalleled natural disaster: 'This is unparalleled in terms of fire activity, in terms of damage and destruction, in terms of multi-agency inter-jurisdictional assistance coming to bear so early in the season.'","Class action launched in NSW Supreme Court for $200 million in damages .

"By . Ruth Styles . He was the French photographer turned Surrealist painter whose oeuvre includes his take on most of the 20th century's key moments. But, say the curators behind the retrospective at the Pompidou Centre in Paris, there was more to Henri Cartier-Bresson than spectacular photography. Instead, his lengthy career encompassed several periods of artistic development, the foundation of the world's first photo agency and some of the first photojournalism ever produced. Revolution: This photo, taken during the May 1968 demonstrations, shows graffiti that reads: Pleasure Without Limits . Portrait of a loved one: This glamorous 1967 snap shows the legs of Cartier-Bresson's wife, Martine Franck . Encompassing surrealism, the tumultuous events of May 1968, the Spanish Civil War, both World Wars and the post-war boom, Cartier-Bresson's work is also a snapshot of the 20th century - warts, wars and all. For Cartier-Bresson, born in 1908, his early years were idyllic ones. The eldest of five brothers born to wealthy parents in Paris, his first attempts at photography were encouraged and abetted by his family who bought him a Box Brownie camera. He was also taught painting by his uncle Louis, although, sadly, the painting lessons were cut short when Louis was killed fighting for France during World War I. The post-war world saw Cartier-Bresson continue to pursue his artistic ambitions, entering a private art school and the Lhote Academy, the Parisian studio of the Cubist painter and sculptor André Lhote. Later life: Cartier-Bresson's later work focused on portraiture such as this one of author Truman Capote . Americana: Martin Luther King pictured at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta (left) and right, a man asleep in a Brooklyn cafe in 1947 . The dying days of a regime: This photo, taken in Shanghai in 1949, shows a queue to exchange worthless paper money for gold . Innocent pastimes: An early photo showing holidaymakers sunbathing by the Marne river in 1936 . New York, New York: Men relax next to a scrap lot on the streets of Harlem in a photo taken in 1947 . Under Lhote's tutelage, Cartier-Bresson enjoyed a classical French art education but fed up with Lhote's rules, left for a stint at Cambridge University in 1928 where he learned to speak English, before in 1930, leaving the UK to complete his military service at Le Bourget. During his military service, he met Caresse Crosby, the wife of hedonistic American publisher, Harry Crosby. Drawn into their decadent social circle, he swiftly began an intense affair with Caresse and was heartbroken when the relationship ended two years later. Desperate to get away, he booked a one-way trip to the then French colony, Côte d'Ivoire, where he survived by shooting game and selling it to locals. Although the period saw Cartier-Bresson narrowly escape death after contracting blackwater fever, it also marked the beginning of his photographic career - all thanks to his faithful Box Brownie. Glamorous: Cartier-Bresson also worked with magazines such as Harper's Bazaar, taking this glamorous shot of model Evelyn Tripp in Las Vegas in 1958 . Portrait of an artist: Painter Henri Matisse photographed at his home in the Alpes-Maritimes circa 1943 - 1944 . Excited: The coronation of George VI in 1937 drew enormous crowds, many of whom had slept on the street (left). Others celebrated with the equally excited policemen . Important: This striking shot was taken during the Spanish Civil War and shows the aftermath of some of the fighting . Striking a pose: Henri Matisse gets to work on a portrait of one of his favourite models, Lydia Delectorskaya, from his studio in Nice . Portrait of a photographer: Cartier-Bresson pictured at work in 1935 . On his return to France in late 1931, the budding photographer purchased himself a more advanced Leica camera and set about building a name for himself. His spontaneous style, capturing moments as they happened and the ordinary people who starred in them, swiftly brought him critical acclaim, although as a surrealist photographer rather than a photojournalist. That came later, when in 1937 when he covered the coronation of George VI and the adoring crowds that greeted the new monarch on the streets of London. His reputation for capturing pivotal moments through the eyes of ordinary people was bolstered during Word War II, thanks to his work with the French Army's film and photography unit, although he was later captured by the Nazis during the Battle of France. Later, after escaping, he joined the Resistance, documenting the activities of agents through photography and film. After the war, he joined Robert Capa and three others to found Magnum Photographs, the world's first photographic agency, and travelled the world on behalf of clients ranging from Vogue to Time magazines. Highlights included his coverage of the final days of the Kuomingtang administration in China before the country fell to Mao's communists, and the funeral of Mahatma Gandhi. His later work, much of which was devoted to portraiture and landscape, also included a rare glimpse inside what was then the Soviet Union, as well as portraits of such luminaries as Marilyn Monroe and Albert Camus. Although Cartier-Bresson retired in the 1970s, he continued to work but in paint instead of on film. He died in 2004, aged 95, in the small and pretty Alpine village of Montjustin - a quiet end to a life lived vividly. Henri Cartier-Bresson runs until the 9th June.

Robert Copeland, 82, resigned Sunday night from the post to which he was re-elected in March, Board of Selectmen Chair Linda Murray said, putting to rest a controversy that drew national attention and sparked impassioned debate in this resort town of 6,300 on the shore of Lake Winnipesaukee. 'The town is pleased,' Murray said Monday. 'This gives us the opportunity to move on. We are a very accepting community that really takes care of each other.' Wolfeboro Police Commission Chair Joe Balboni said in a statement that the resgination went into effect at 10:34pm on Sunday evening. Balboni said he and fellow Police Commissioner Ron Goodgame will appoint . someone new. Thohose who wish to apply, he said, 'must be registered voters and . residents of the town for at least five years.' He's out! Robert Copeland, seen in this May 15 photo, resigned from his position as Wolfeboro Police Commissioner on Sunday evening . Angry? Robert Copeland is seen in this May 15 photo being confronted by Whitney White, right, and Elizabeth Smith after a meeting where Wolfeboro residents asked for him to step down . Copeland has not returned several calls seeking comment. At a meeting last week, Copeland defiantly sat with his arms folded as more than 100 residents pushed for his ouster and tore into his comments, saying he didn't speak for the town or its people. Copeland admitted using the slur, preceded by an obscenity, while he was at a restaurant in March. A resident, Jane O'Toole, overheard him and complained to town officials when she learned that Copeland was a police commissioner. O'Toole told the Concord Monitor on March 6 she heard the man complain about seeing 'that f------ n-----' on television. 'I believe I did use the 'N' word in reference to the current occupant of the Whitehouse,' Copeland wrote in the April email sent to the two other commissioners and forwarded to O'Toole. 'For this, I do not apologize — he meets and exceeds my criteria for such.' 'While I believe the problems associated with minorities in this country are momentous, I am not phobic,' he also wrote. 'My use of derogatory slang in reference to those among them undeserving of respect is no secret. It is the exercise of my 1st Amendment rights.' That defiance did not sit well with many in the town. 'I thought it was disgusting, and the way he justified it, it was even more disgusting,' said Ernie Bauer, a 64-year-old carpenter. 'It was disgusting 50 years ago.' A handful of people at the meeting spoke on behalf of Copeland, saying he had a right to free speech. But the louder message came from those who wanted him out. O'Toole said Monday that she was pleased he stepped down. Admission: 'I believe I did use the 'N' word in reference to the current occupant of the Whitehouse,' Copeland said in an email . Hard to hear: Town resident Jane O'Toole, pictured at the May 15 meeting, says she heard Robert Copeland use a racial slur to refering to President Obama . Critic: Mitt Romney, seen in Wolfeboro in this 2012 file photo, said 'the vile epithet used and confirmed by the commissioner has no place in our community' 'I feel it was the right thing for him to do to stop this incredible train that had been blowing through our town,' she said. 'I'm thrilled. The people of Wolfeboro have stood up and said that this is not acceptable.' Mitt Romney, the former GOP presidential nominee and a former Massachusetts governor, owns a home in Wolfeboro and had called for Copeland's resignation, saying 'the vile epithet used and confirmed by the commissioner has no place in our community.' About 20 black people live year-round in Wolfeboro, in the scenic Lakes Region of New Hampshire, a state that's 94 percent white and 1 percent black. None of the town police department's 12 full-time officers is black or a member of another minority. Police Chief Stuart Chase said Copeland's slur was 'not indicative of the posture of this department. We treat everyone with dignity and respect.' Town officials also said they were appalled by Copeland's comments but said they were powerless to remove an elected official. Jamie Murray said she wasn't surprised to hear racist comments since her biracial son has also faced taunts. 'It also gave me an understanding as to why the children think it's OK,' she said Monday. 'When you're held in office, and you decide to become an elected official, you represent something higher than your own standards and your own things, and you need to stand up for the community in which you serve.'","Robert Copeland, 82, resigned from his position as a police commissioner for Wolfeboro, New Hampshire .

"An empty glass bottle bought for just $5 at a flea market turned out to be an incredibly rare 130-year-old forerunner to Coca-Cola. Jim Vergo, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, bought the French Wine Coca bottle after it caught his eye among a heap of bric-a-brac and took it home to put in his collection. It was only when he noticed the bottle was embossed with the name John Pemberton, the inventor of Coca-Cola, that he realised what he had just bought. This empty glass bottle, which was bought for just $5 at a flea market, is in fact an incredibly rare 130-year-old forerunner to Coca-Cola . French Wine Coca was the brainchild of Dr Pemberton, a pharmacist who had fought in the Civil War, and was a blend of wine, alcohol and cocaine launched in the early 1880s. Pemberton marketed it as 'nerve tonic' and extolled its astounding medical qualities, claiming it could cure morphine addiction, headaches, constipation and even impotence. Its paper label boasted it was: 'The marvellous invigorater! The great nerve tonic! The queen of stimulants! The intellectual beverage!' The concoction was an instant hit but with laws tightening around the use of alcohol in 1886, Dr Pemberton developed a non-alcoholic variation using the kola nut. He named the new elixir Coca-Cola after its two main elements - cocaine and kola nut. It wasn't until 1929 that the drink became completely free of the narcotic. It was only when Mr Vergo noticed the bottle was embossed with the name John Pemberton, the inventor of Coca-Cola, that he realised what he had just bought . Coca-Cola went on to become the world's best selling drink. An estimated two billion glasses of Coca-Cola are now drunk worldwide every day. After being studied by experts the bottle, now for sale for $5,000, was revealed to be the best example of only three French Wine Coca bottles known to exist because its label is still in tact. It is the only one ever to come up at auction, and is now estimated to sell for 1,500 times the price Mr Vergo paid for it just six months ago. Mr Vergo, a casino poker dealer and amateur antiques collector, said: 'It caught my eye and I could see that it was related to the coca plant because it had a coca leaves on the label and it said ""wine coca"". 'It was embossed with the name Pemberton. I'm not a big Coca-Cola collector so it wasn't until I got home that I Googled and saw that it was Dr. Pemberton, the creator of Coca-Cola. French Wine Coca was the brainchild of Dr Pemberton, a pharmacist who had fought in the Civil War, and was a blend of wine, alcohol and cocaine launched in the early 1880s . 'It sounds like it's the only one like it in the world with the label in tact. If that's the case then a Coca-Cola collector needs to own it.' Tom Slater, director of Americana at auctioneers Heritage, said: 'The bottle, embossed with Coca-Cola creator John Pemberton's name and retaining 90 per cent of the original label, has been dated to the 1880s and is believed to be one of just three such bottles known to exist. 'This is as rare a piece of pop culture relating to the world's most beloved beverage as you are ever likely to see. 'The mostly intact original label establishes the example we are selling as being in the finest condition of the few specimens known to exist. 'Condition is nearly as important as rarity to serious collectors of antique advertising items. 'When these two qualities converge in the same item, as is the case here, interest from hobbyists increases exponentially. 'There's really no telling what something like this is potentially worth since nothing like it has ever really been up for public auction. 'We're opening the bidding at what we feel is a conservative jumping off point and we'll await the verdict of the marketplace.' The auction will take place in Dallas on May 24.","Jim Vergo bought the French Wine Coca bottle for $5 at a flea market .

"By . Associated Press . Sante Kimes, who along with her son made up a notorious grifter team convicted of the murders of a wealthy widow in New York and a businessman in LA, has died in her prison cell aged 79. Kimes, who was portrayed by Mary Tyler Moore in a TV movie, died on Monday night after being found unresponsive at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County, said Linda Foglia, spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections. In 2000, Kimes and her son, Kenneth Kimes, were convicted of murder in connection with the disappearance of Irene Silverman, an 82-year-old widow and former Radio City Music Hall Rockette. Sante Kimes testifies during her murder trial in Los Angeles Superior Court. A state prison spokeswoman says Kimes, who was convicted with her son of murdering a wealthy widow, died in her cell at Bedford Hills Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York on Monday . An undated photo of Sante Kimes and her son Kenneth. The pair were sentenced to life in prison for murdering a wealthy widow for her Manhattan townhouse. The body of Irene Silverman has never been found . The Kimeses conspired to steal Silverman's $7million Manhattan town house and other possessions, and her body has never been found. Kimes planned to assume the identity of the 82-year-old multimillionaire. At the time of the Kimeses' sentencing, authorities said Kenneth Kimes strangled Silverman and then he and his mother put her body in garbage bags and disposed of it somewhere only they knew. A police search of their car and luggage found guns, a knockout liquid, plastic handcuffs, fright masks, syringes, tapes of Silverman's telephone conversations and a fake deed to Silverman's home. Sante Kimes was sentenced to 120 years in prison and would not have been eligible for parole until 2119. Her son received 125 years. They were convicted using evidence from Kimes' notebooks which laid out the crime in detail along with notes written by Silverman, who was extremely suspicious of the mother and son. In 2004, Sante Kimes was convicted in California of murder in the 1998 death of businessman David Kazdin, whose body was found in a trash bin. She was later sentenced to life in prison. Although the Kazdin murder happened first, the mother-and-son team were arrested in New York City and so were tried first for the Silverman murder. Evidence in their car built the case for Kazdin's murder. Kenneth Kimes, who pleaded guilty in 2003, also was sentenced to life in prison. He said his mother planned Kazdin's killing and sent him to do the job. This police photo, released in July 1998, shows Sante Kimes, part of a mother-and-son grifter team convicted of kidnapping and murdering wealthy widow Irene Silverman . He testified that he shot Kazdin in the back of the head at close range and that someone he found at a homeless shelter helped him dispose of the body. He said his mother decided to kill Kazdin, an old friend, after Kazdin found out that she had taken out a $280,000 loan by forging his signature. Kenneth confessed to murdering a third man, banker Sayed Bilal Ahmed, on his mother's orders in The Bahamas in 1996. No charges were ever filed but Kenneth Kimes said that he and his mother drugged Ahmed and drowned him a bathtub before dumping his body in the sea. Santa Kimes denied any involvement. Sante Kimes' criminal past also included a 1986 conviction for illegally transporting Mexican girls and keeping them as prisoners and household slaves in her Las Vegas home. The made-for-TV movie about the Kimeses, Like Mother Like Son: The Strange Story of Sante and Kenny Kimes, featured Gabriel Olds as the son. Kimes was born Sandra Louise Walker in Oklahoma City, according to court records. Mary Tyler Moore and Gabriel Olds star in Like Mother, Like Son: The Strange Story of Sante and Kenny Kimes, a 2001 TV movie . Kent Walker, Kimes' estranged son said in . his book Son Of A Grifter, that his mother was from a good family who . were unable to cope with her wild ways. In one of her wildly varying stories . about her past, Kimes claimed that her father was a laborer and . her mother a prostitute who left Oklahoma for LA, leaving her young daughter to fend for herself. Kimes also committed insurance fraud and arson so she could collect on property damage. She was a skilled grifter - once even managing to gain access to a Ford administration reception . at the White House by introducing her husband as an ambassador. She . loved to impersonate Elizabeth Taylor, to whom she had a passing . resemblance.","Sante Kimes died on Monday night after being found unresponsive in her Westchester, New York cell .

"By . Jennifer Newton . The FBI could be set to reverse their policy of not hiring staff who have smoked cannabis in the last three years . The FBI could be set to reverse its policy of not hiring staff who have smoked marijuana in the past three years after struggling to recruit computer hackers. At the annual conference of the White Collar Crime Institute, the director of the agency told the audience that the policy means they can't take on some of the staff they would like. The FBI announced last year that it was increasing its workforce and expanding its suspect-surveillance programmes. It is thought these will include tactics more commonly associated with underground computer hackers and other tech-savvy criminals. But as potential employees aren't allowed to have smoked the drug in the last three years, the agency say they now have a recruitment problem. 'I have to hire a great work force to compete with those cybercriminals, and some of those kids want to smoke weed on the way to the interview', director James Comey said, according to the Wall Street Journal. He also talked about how the FBI was discussing how to amend its marijuana policy to combat the recruitment problem. Cannabis has recently been legalised in two states including Colarado, which allowed the drug to go on sale at the start of the year at two dozen shops. State residents aged 21 and over are permitted to buy an ounce, and visitors a quarter ounce. Previously FBI recruits were unable to join the agency if they had used the drug more than 15 times in their life. Scroll down for video . The FBI director made the comments while addressing the annual conference of the White Collar Crime Institute . Mr Comey made the revelation on the same day that United States brought first-of-its kind cyber-espionage charges against five Chinese military officials accused of hacking into U.S. companies to gain trade secrets. The FBI had been searching for the men, who are thought to have operated from a fortified building on the outskirts of Shanghai. But China rejected the charges as 'ungrounded and absurd' and denied its military or government personnel had ever participated in cyber theft of trade secrets.","FBI only take on staff who have not smoked marijuana in the last three years .

Spokesman Mike Barton said the body of Stephen Hancock from Coal City, Illinois, was found on Tuesday. Barton said Hancock was a member of the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing and a crewmember of an Osprey that was conducting a training flight on Monday evening. Nobody knows what happened but Barton said it appears the Hancock died as a result of the fall. The aircraft had taken part in a training exercise at the airport in Elizabethtown.

'We did not learn of his fall immediately and we are not sure why,' 1st Lt. Hector Alejandro, spokesman for the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, told NBC News on Wednesday. 'It's going to be investigated. It is unfortunate the length of time it took, and honestly we don't know how long that was. Marines . in Ospreys are always supposed to be secured, either by seat belts or . tether cables.

Barton said he didn't know how high the Osprey was flying or the number of crew aboard at the time of the accident. Ten helicopters backed up by 100 marines searched for the body on the ground and in the air. The Osprey had been performing 'touch and go' maneuvers, where a pilot lands and immediately takes off without coming to a stop, at a nearby airport before the incident. The cargo door of an Osprey - which can take off like a helicopter and fly like a plane - remains open during this exercise but marines are always tethered in accordance with standard operational procedure.","The family of Steven Hancock from Coal City, IL had been notified their son was missing .

"By . Ashley Collman . Donald Sterling tried to bribe his mistress V.Stiviano into saying she doctored tapes of the Los Angeles Clippers owner making offensive racist statements. Clippers President Andy Roeser also tried to cover-up the recordings before they were released by TMZ last month, according to a report by the NBA's chief investigator. Chief investigator David B Anders has compiled a 30-page report on the scandal, along with hundreds of pages of supporting statements, ahead of a June 3 hearing in which the 29 other NBA owners will vote on whether to force Sterling to sell his team. Bribe: A new report by the NBA's chief investigator reveals Donald Sterling tried to bribe his mistress V. Stiviano (pictured out in LA yesterday) into saying she doctored tapes in which he was recoded making racist statements . Lunch date: Stiviano was pictured out yesterday having lunch with a friend in Beverly Hills . He said/she said: The NBA chief investigator interviewed Stiviano (left), 20 clippers employees, 14 league officials and others for the report . The Los Angeles Times reviewed the confidential report, which found that Sterling, 80, tried to pay off his mistress just before she sat down for a televised interview with Barbara Walters. Sterling showed up at the Beverly Hills Four Seasons, where the interview was being taped on May 2, and asked 31-year-old Stiviano to make a payment to his wife. Sterling's 79-year-old wife Shelly, had brought up a lawsuit against Stiviano before recordings were released in which Sterling can be heard telling his much-younger mistress not to bring black people to Clippers games or post with them in pictures. Meeting: Sterling met with Stiviano just before she sat down for her Barbara Walters interview (above), and asked her to say publicly that she doctored the racist recordings . Faithful: Stiviano was also pictured out yesterday praying at Our Lady of Mr Lebanon-St Peter Cathedral in Los Angeles . Shelly accused Stiviano of swindling cash, real estate and cars from her family. If Stiviano paid what Shelly wanted, 'Mr Sterling said that he would return the value of that payment to Ms Stiviano through back channels,' the investigator said. In exchange, Sterling asked Stiviano to say publicly that she doctored the recordings. But Sterling ended up leaving the hotel in a huff when Stiviano called her lawyers into a conference room and asked Sterling to repeat his offer in front of them. And that wasn't the first time Sterling tried to lie about the recordings. Wasn't me: NBA's chief investigator David Anders says Sterling lied to him, saying his statements had been altered in the tape . The day after the recordings were released, Sterling put out a statement saying: 'We have heard the tape on TMZ We do not know if it is legitimate or if it has been altered.' The NBA called this statement  intentionally misleading since Sterling knew it was his voice on the tapes. The also say he lied to Anders when the NBA's investigator called him up, saying he didn't make some of the statements and that certain comments had been altered. He said that he told Stiviano not to bring 'gangbangers' to games - not black people in general or ex-NBA star Magic Johnson specifically. The investigation also revealed that the recordings first surfaced on April 9 - more than two weeks before TMZ aired the clips. Stiviano first sent those tapes to Clippers management, and an employee testified that team President Andy Roeser ordered him to delete evidence of the clips along Stiviano's text messages. He knew: The report found that Clippers President Andy Roeser found out about the tapes two weeks before they were released and tried to have them destroyed. Pictured above at a press conference in 2011. He has since been placed on indefinite leave by the league . 'The employee at first questioned Mr. Roeser, asking him if he was sure that the employee should delete the files,' the summary said. 'Mr. Roeser said he was sure.' Roeser is currently on indefinite leave from the league. The report is also trying to make a case for pushing Shelly Sterling from Clippers ownership, since she independently owns 50 per cent of the team. Shelly has been making a public case for keeping her stake, distancing herself from her husband by saying they are estranged and have been living apart. But the NBA has refuted these claims in the report, which found found that Shelly spent the two days after the scandal with her husband. She was even recorded leaving a downtown LA restaurant with her husband after the scandal, and when asked by a reporter if she thinks he's a racist, appears to say 'of course not'. Her lawyer contends that she thought the reporter was asking her if she was racist. Bye, Mrs Sterling: The NBA provided evidence that Shelly Sterling (left) and her husband are not estranged as they try to force her out of the team as well. Pictured above at a Clippers game with her lawyer on May 15 . They also say that the Sterlings attended nearly every Clippers home game together this season, along with traveling to the New Orleans All-Star game in February.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When it comes to the NFL, the show must go on... unless of course, there's a major snowstorm. The NFL has said that it there is a possibility that Super Bowl XLVIII could be played on an alternative day to February 2nd should bad weather be scheduled to hit the area on game day. However, any decision to play the Super Bowl on a day other than Superbowl Sunday would have to be made 36 hours in advance. The show must go on:  Some snow or showers could be in the forecast for Super Sunday, February 2nd . Chilly outlook: MetLife Stadium, which will host Superbowl XLVIII next month is being called the first ever 'cold weather superbowl,' the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks will face off in front of over 80,000 fans on February 2 . Shiver supporters: Cold weather welcome kits have been produced for fans that will include earmuffs, hats, mittens, hand warmers, lip balm, and tissues, among other items . NFL Executive Vice President Eric Grubman has said a time frame has been worked out if bad weather forces a change in the Super Bowl schedule. Denver and Seattle are scheduled to kick off the Super Bowl in East Rutherford, New Jersey, at 6:30 p.m. on Sunday, February 2nd. Long-range forecasts call for the possibility of snow on that date, but the NFL has decided the game could be played on any day from Friday, January 31st to Monday, February 3rd - or it could be moved back even further. If there is an unexpected storm that brings the metropolitan area to a halt, then the league has contingency plans to reschedule the game for a different date. 'We would need 24 hours to move the game time,' Mr Grubman said. 'We need 36 hours to move the day.' A snowstorm that hit the region this week gave crews a chance to clear the stadium, concourses and parking lots in a 'dress rehearsal.' Prepared: After a snowstorm hit the New York region with a foot of snow earlier this week, the NFL and local authorities are doing everying possible to prepare for a snowstorm on the day of the game . Huge event: New Jersey's MetLife stadium will play host to the Super Bowl on February 2 . It took 18 hours for a complete cleanup of snow from the stadium area. 'Crews at the stadium will be ready to move snow in the parking lots, seating areas and on the field and on our vitally important roadways,'' said Al Kelly, chairman of the Super Bowl Host Committee. 'We will be prepared to move snow quickly. These efforts will enable hundreds of thousands of visitors to move more easily through the region, whether they're going to the Super Bowl, another event, or Met-Life Stadium. The reality is that many of us in the New York and New Jersey area are accustomed to it. A snowstorm can hit at any time, but that doesn't mean people should not be able to move around or football not be able to be played. The key is to be prepared and have the resources in place and be able to clear the snow efficiently.' 'We want to make sure that the national audience know that this region has tremendous assets and resources to get this done,'' Supovitz said. 'It's nothing more than reassuring people that despite the fact that the world's greatest event is going to be here, we still know how to clear snow. We keep the markets open every day and schools open most days. We'll do a good job Super Bowl week as well.'' The show must go on: Bruno Mars, a star with extraordinary appeal, is set to entertain the crowds at the big game¿s halftime show. These performances always feature medleys and ¿ even with just two albums ¿ Mars has enough likable material to fit the bill .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Audio recordings of the 'ping' signals believed to have come from the black box of Flight MH370 will now not be released as doubt grows over whether they are connected with the missing plane. The Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) headed by Angus Houston told the Herald Sun that the search group's original confidence the four accoustic 'ping' signals were from the plane had waned and the recordings would not be made public. 'The recordings of the detections will not be released at this point in time,' the JACC said. 'We continue to pursue this lead to either discount or confirm the area of the detections as the final resting place of MH370.' Scroll down for video . Search uncertainty: the black box of missing Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 (stock picture) may not be the source of the pings recorded in the search for the plane, analysts now say . The search co-ordination agency headed by retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston says there is now doubt over whether the pings recorded by search vessels are from the black box of the missing MH370 aircraft . The decision is a blow to the families of some of the MH370 passengers who issued a plea earlier this month to make the recordings public. A group of families called Voice370 released a statement saying, 'We implore the Malaysian government to share and release the raw Inmarsat satellite engine ping data for 9MMRO (every ping from Friday, March 7 12:00 until the final signal was received globally) so that it can be subject to broader analysis by relevant experts. This is a departure from Retired Air Chief Marshall Houston's certainty last month that the ping recordings were potentially from the missing plane. The pings detected by the Australian Defence vessel Ocean Shield's pinger locator in the search for the missing flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder in the southern Indian Ocean may now not be released . The towed pinger locator (TPL-25) on the deck of the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield detected two  signals which were thought to be from a black box transponder, but further analysis has shown the signals may have no connection with MH370 . Mr Houston said a possible fifth ping detected by a surveillance plane conducting an accoustic search had the potential of being from a man-made source, although it required further detailed analysis. The Australian Joint Acoustic Analysis Centre based at HMAS Albatross in Nowra, on the NSW coast south of Sydney, had concluded that two pings detected by the ship Ocean Shield’s towed-pinger locater on April 5 and April 8 were from a source that was not of 'natural origin' and was 'likely sourced' from specific electronic equipment. At the time, U.S. Navy Captain Mark Matthews said the it was 'certainly a man-made device emitting that signal and I have no explanation for what other component could be there'. 'I'm an engineer so I don't talk emotions too much. But certainly when I received word that they had another detection, you feel elated. 'You're hopeful that you can locate the final resting place of the aircraft and bring closure to all the families involved.'

"By . Katy Winter . Many women around the world dream of being able to eat whatever they want and have any weight they gain go straight to their cleavage. But with the stereotypical perfect female body being both very slender yet with large breasts most women fight a constant battle between avoiding the snack aisle and bemoaning their shrinking assets. However one confectionery maker in Japan aims to bring women the best of both worlds, creating 'F Cup' cookies that claim to enhance breast size. Each cookie contains 50mg of Pueraria Mirifica, plant extract found in plant found in northern and north eastern Thailand . The makers say that eating just two a day will create a noticeable difference in breast size, and they have spread in popularity not only through Japan but other parts of Asia. Subtly named ‘F cup cookies’ the biscuits contain 50mg of Pueraria Mirifica (a plant extract found in plant in northern and north eastern Thailand) extract per cookie. The plant Pueraria Mirifica contains a molecule similar to oestrogen known as Miroestrol which mimics the biological activities of the hormone. Human oestrogen plays an important role in breast development and determining their size, and the F cup Cookies claim that the Mirestrol in the biscuits will act in the same way on the body when eaten. Most women fight a constant battle between avoiding the snack aisle and bemoaning their shrinking assets . While eating boob-boosting cookies might sound great, there is no scientific evidence at all that Miroestrol has a similar effect to oestrogen on humans when eaten . However, while the idea of the only consequence of indulging in sweet treats being a larger cup size might sound appealing, there is no scientific evidence at all that Miroestrol has a similar effect to oestrogen on humans when eaten. It also has been claimed – though in a similarly unproven manner – that Pueraria Mirifica extract can be taken to increase appetite, which, if true may well increase a person’s breast size through increased fat but is unlikely to be noticed as the weight gain will occur on the entire body. Nutrition expert Ian Marber says: 'Phytoestrogens are in numerous foods and to date there is no research to show that ingestion changes breast size. ‘Even concentrated doses haven't been shown to do anything, although eating several biscuits can lead to weight gain with all that goes with it.’","Cookies sold in Japan promise to have noticeable effect on cup size .

"By . Julian Robinson . Rock star Courtney Love has revealed how she saw Peaches Geldof and a friend at her hotel with 500 ‘hillbilly heroin’ pills – before she ‘pushed’ the young star out of the door. The rocker, who has battled drug addiction in the past, said she was horrified when she saw the pair with a bag of tablets. The 49-year-old was staying at the upmarket Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles when she met up with Bob Geldof’s daughter. Scroll down to see video. Courtney Love, pictured left, reveals how she tried 'to help' Peaches Geldof, right before her heroin-related death . Miss Geldof's friend had a bag of the opiate-based OxyContin tablets, known as ‘hillbilly heroin’, a pain relieving drug sometimes abused by people seeking a heroin-style high. But when Ms Love saw the pills she said she 'physically' pushed Peaches and her friend out of the door. Recalling the incident, in 2010, she told Grazia that the encounter made her want her to help the young socialite - but that despite trying to mentor her 'it proved to be impossible'. 'My drug was heroin, I stopped taking it in the 90s, but I have taken the pills, the Roxycontin, Oxycontin,' she said. 'Peaches was in a room with a friend who had a bag full of these drugs, like 500 pills and I wanted it so badly, never have I ever wanted anything more - no man, no money - and I had to physically push Peaches and her friend out of the door. 'I was shaking and I kept thinking of the way her mother died and I thought I owe it to this girl to be an example.’ She . said the encounter with ‘vivacious’ Miss Geldof, who was 21 at the time, brought her out in a . ‘cold sweat’ and that she had to battled her urges ‘when the junkie in . me came out’ during their meeting. Tragic: The socialite, pictured with her husband and children, died last month and her death was linked to heroin . The magazine columnist’s death had tragic similarities to that of her mother, Paula Yates, who died from an accidental heroin overdose in 2000 at the age of 41. Ms Love said she believed the 25-year-old had turned her life around before her death having appeared to settle down after marrying Thomas Cohen and having two children, Astala and Phaedra. And she added that she was grateful the daughter she had with late husband Kurt Cobain, Frances Bean, was ‘sensible’. 'It terrifies me': The 49-year-old admits what happened to Peaches makes her fear for her daughter, who she is seen with in 2009, but Courtney added that Frances Bean is 'sensible' Miss Geldof was found dead in her home on April 7. Mr Cohen found her slumped on her bed after he had been unable to contact her the night before. It was revealed at the opening of the TV presenter and columnist’s inquest that recent heroin use ‘was likely to have played a role’ in her death. Earlier this month, police confirmed that drugs paraphernalia had been found in her home. After launching an investigation into the death, Kent Police said it was ‘unexplained with no third party’ involvement, and added that Mr Cohen was not under suspicion of any involvement. Officers also revealed that burglars had struck twice at the couple's home since she died. A red ride-on lawnmower, which featured in one of their family photographs taken before Miss Geldof’s death, was stolen in the first incident in mid-April. Peaches Geldof and Thomas Cohen, pictured attending the Wold of Wall Street UK premiere, were overheard arguing on a train into central London just days before she died . No items were stolen in the second break-in. CCTV had been installed in the £1million home, in Wrotham, Kent, but the cameras were damaged by the trespassers. It later emerged Miss Geldof  had argued with her husband over her 'obsession' with heroin addict singer Elliott Smith the last time they were seen in public, four days before her death. The pair were overheard arguing on a train into central London, over the number of songs the 25-year-old had on her iPhone by the U.S singer who committed suicide 10 years ago. Mr Cohen, 23, left the train alone following the row. It is believed to be the last time he saw his wife alive. Four days later he returned to their Wrotham home after growing concerned when he struggled to reach her. He discovered Peaches' lifeless body slumped across a spare bed. Police officers attend the home of Peaches Geldof in Wrotham, Kent following her death in April . It has also emerged that Miss Geldof had been secretly visiting a drug rehab clinic close to her home in Maidstone in the weeks before her death. Peaches was buried last month in a coffin decorated with a picture of her young family at the church near Faversham where she married just two years ago. It was also where her parents – Miss Yates and Bob Geldof – tied the knot in 1986 and where her mother’s funeral was held. An inquest into her death has been adjourned until July 23.","Courtney Love says Peaches Geldof was at same Los Angeles hotel with friend who was carrying pills .

"By . James  Nye . Problems with the police were the least of one Houston teenager's worries when his mother and grandmother arrived to publicly scold him in the back of a squad car after his arrest earlier this month. Having already turned her own son over to the law for an attempted armed robbery, the boy's mother, Deandra, was joined by her own irate mother outside the police station as a tough-love tag-team. 'What did you do? You did do something. You wouldn't be in this police car. What did you do?' the 16-year-old's grandmother is seen on video screaming at her grandson. 'Take your butt to school and this wouldn't happen, would it,' his grandma adds for good measure. 'What did you do?!' The teenagers furious grandmother catches up with him as he sits in the back of the police car after being handed over by his mother . The furious woman was demanding an explanation from the teen as to why his mother had escorted him to the police station after Houston police say a man reported two suspects tried to rob him at gunpoint near a northeast Houston gas station. Justifying why she turned her child over to the police, Deandra said that, 'People work too hard for their stuff and somebody is going to shoot you.

'I don't want to see that, I don't want to see that. I want for the best, and if this is what it takes for him to get help, let him get some help.' She said she thought her son was out at a job interview when the armed robbery at the gas station was going on. 'My husband said he was well-dressed so I thought maybe he was going to look for a job,' she said to ABC 13. But when she found out police were looking for her teen, Houston police said this mom brought him back to the scene. Police say the 16-year-old teen and another 15-year-old boy are suspected in another nearby incident, and could face attempted robbery charges.","Teenager in Houston driven to police station by his own mother after allegedly trying to rob a man at gunpoint .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Wall Street is known for the Charging Bull of Broadway, but on Tuesday night it was all about a cash cow. Chilean artist Sebastian Errazuriz filled a giant golden calf pinata full of dollar bills - $1,000 worth to be precise. He then handed gallery goers large sticks and set them loose to beat the 15ft high and 24ft long glittering beast until the cash fell from the sky. Cash cow: A beast of a pinata in the form of a large golden bull stuffed with cash was smashed in New York on Tuesday night . Sculpture: The interactive art sculpture, called 'XXth Century Capital' is the work of Chilean artist Sebastian Errazuriz . The visitors then scrambled to get their hands on the free money, as it tumbled from the cash cow - a mythic symbol of wealth and greed. 'It's a golden calf from the Bible, a false idol, the Bull of Wall Street,' Errazuriz said from Industry City warehouses in Brooklyn's Sunset Park. The interactive art sculpture, called 'XXth Century Capital' or The Giant Golden Pinata, was created as a commission for Wanted Design Fair to inaugurate the opening of the NYC x Design event. Creator: Errazuriz, pictured, created the 15ft high, 24ft long piece as a commission for Wanted Design Fair who wanted an installation to inaugurate the opening of the NYC x Design event . Pinata: The giant pinata was on view to the public in Industry City, Brooklyn, and saw them invited to grab as much of the cash as they could when it was smashed open at 5p.m. In the stark critique of capitalism, the crowd took turns whacking the bull with broomsticks that, for added effect, were wrapped in Communist-red tape. Finally, just after 5p.m., the spectacular animal's under belly gave way, and the rain began to fall into outstretched arms. Visitors were invited to grab as much of the cash as they could. According to the New York Daily News, a tall member of the crowd was ushered out of the way to make room for a small girl who was being lifted up so she could reach the dollars.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman has come forward claiming to be the secret fiancee of New York Giants No. 1 draft pick Odell Beckham Jr, spreading stories of alleged dalliances with strippers and saying he had a love child while dating her. The NFL is now said to be investigating the claims against the 21-year-old rookie, who just inked a four year deal with the Giants worth $10.4 million deal with the team, including a $5.9 million signing bonus. He says the 'entire story is fabricated'. 'I have never been engaged, I don't have any children and I have never met this person who is making these claims,' Beckham said in a statement to The New York Daily News. Fiancee?: Erica Mendez, 19, claims she has been dating New York Odell Beckham Jr since 2010, that he cheated on her with two strippers and has a love child . O'Dell Beckham Jr.  formerly played for the LSU Tigers. He says he has never met Erica Mendez and that nothing she says is true . The woman, Erica Mendez, is a 19-year-old self-described model and personal trainer from Texas. She told RadarOnline she has been dating Beckham since November 2010, when they were both teenagers, saying the LSU star 'swept me off my feet'. 'I had come from a broken home and was looking for stability,' she said. 'He treated me like a queen.' Mendez said Beckham showered them . showering her with gifts including a new BMW and jetting her to Paris and London, she said. Then she discovered he was cheating on her — and had a love child from one fling, she said. During one alleged angry text exchange between the pair, Odell supposedly writes, 'U ain’t never believe anything I say!’ and she replies, 'Why is that? I believed that you were faithful and you had a child on me? Did u fall on your head lately Odelliee?’ Mendez told Radar: 'We fought about the child, but he claimed he was a changed man. I wanted so badly to believe him, so I stuck around.' Eva Mendez, who claims she is the long-time fiancee of Odell Beckham Jr., seen here in a picture from her Instagram account . Odell Beckham Jr poses with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell after he was picked #12 overall by the New York Giants during the first round of the 2014 NFL Draft at Radio City Music Hall on May 8, 2014 in New York City . She said she then became pregnant in February 2013. But the stress of trying to deal with his cheating was too much, and she suffered a miscarriage, Mendez said. The pair bonded over their loss, she told Radar, and he proposed to her. 'He promised to change and that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. Too bad it was all just lies,' Mendez said. She said she walked into his parents’ home in New Orleans in August 2013, shortly after they were engaged, and found him in a 'sexually compromising position’' with two strippers. 'There were glasses thrown. It was quite a commotion,' she said. 'That was the final straw.' During one alleged text exchange between the pair, she wrote, 'Soo you’re still going to act like you did nothing wrong? Even now?' 'What u talkin bout now???' he allegedly replied. Eva Mendez came forward with her claims just days after Beckham was selected for the NFL draft . 'Umm, when I walked in and you had the two strippers in the bed that we slept in Odell. Forgot?’ Mendez retorted. 'Look I ain’t tryin talk about that sh-ttt. You wasn’t complaining after I sent you and ya mom to Cozumel,’' Odell supposedly snipped. But bizarrely, she told the Web site that the couple recently reconciled — and the wedding’s still on for next March. 'We love each other,” she said. “Everybody makes mistakes. He has promised he has changed. I have faith in him.' Odell’s dad, Odell Beckham Sr., told The Post that the family has hired a private investigator to try to track the woman down. 'This is just a made-up, fictitious individual,’' Beckham Sr. said. Erica Mendez is a 19-year-old self-described model and personal trainer from Texas who claims to be the fiancee of Odell Beckham Jr. 'It’s a hoax. … She’s just a kid who came out of nowhere, and we’re like, ''Who is this?'' The dad said both he and Odell’s mom “are really into our son’s life. 'We know who he dates, who his girlfriend is. It’s not anyone named Erica,’ the dad said. 'He’s actually seeing a young lady who went to Alabama.’ 'The only child he has is a pit bull named Dre, about 2 years old. That’s the son he raised.' A Giants spokesman said the NFL was involved. 'The organization has contacted NFL security to look into finding the person responsible and to help investigate the matter’ he said.","Odell Beckham Jr. was drafted by the New York Giants on May 8 .

'Confidence,' says Mantell, who after posting a video of his commencement address on Youtube has become a viral sensation with over 200,000 views.'Beethoven was deaf; imagine if he had never dared to listen to his calling to compose music, ' Mantell asked his graduating class as he urged them to go after their wildest dreams.

'Ray Charles was blind; imagine if he had never dared to envision that he could touch the keys of a piano,' he said. 'Albert Einstein was dyslexic; imagine if he had never dared to embrace seeing things differently by formulating equations,' Mantell spoke as he exemplified the power of creative solutions.

"By . Associated Press . General Motors has added yet another recall to its growing list for the year. The recall of 218,000 Chevrolet Aveo subcompact cars is the company's 29th this year, bringing the total number of recalled GM vehicles in the U.S. to around 13.8 million. That breaks GM's previous annual record of 10.75 million set in calendar year 2004. Recall: General Motors recalled 218,000 Chevrolet Aveo subcompact cars, model years 2004 through 2008. The daytime running light module in the dashboard center stack can overheat, melt and catch fire . .The new recall, posted Wednesday on the . National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, covers Aveos . from the 2004 through 2008 model years. The daytime running light module . in the dashboard center stack can overheat, melt and catch fire. GM is . aware of an unspecified number of fires due to the problem, but . spokesman Alan Adler says it does not know of any injuries or deaths. GM says it is still developing a plan to fix the problem and will provide details as soon as possible . The high number of recalls this year is fallout from a deadly ignition switch problem in compact cars that is responsible for at least 13 deaths. Millions recalled: GM is recalling another 2.42 million vehicles in the United States, raising the number of vehicles it has recalled so far this year to more than 15 million . GM has admitted knowing about the problem for at least a decade, yet it didn't recall the cars until February of this year. On Tuesday GM announced it would recall 2.4 million vehicles in the U.S. In May alone, GM has recalled about 5.5 million cars and trucks. Last week the company agreed to pay a $35 million federal fine for concealing deadly defects in small-car ignition switches. Although the company says the death toll from the ignition switches is at least 13, trial lawyers suing the company say it's at least 53. Solving the problem: General Motors is recalling 2.4 million vehicles in the U.S., including Pontiac G6's from the 2005-2008 model years, as part of a broader effort to resolve outstanding safety issues more quickly . The Detroit automaker said it will take a $400 million charge for repairs on all vehicles recalled so far this quarter. That's on top of a $1.3 billion charge the automaker took for recalls in the first quarter. Jeff Boyer, the company's new safety chief, said in a recent interview that the ignition switch recall led the company to examine all of its safety issues, and that has resulted in the spate of recalls. GM has added 35 safety investigators and has moved Boyer's position up to the level of vice president. Nothing but problems: General Motors has recalled millions of vehicles in recent months due to a power steering defect and a faulty ignition-switch . 'We're not waiting for warranty trends to develop over time,' he said in the interview. 'It's not only about frequency, it has to be about the seriousness of the potential defect as well.'

"By . Leon Watson . Pope Francis says his upcoming trip to the Holy Land of Jordan, Israel and the West Bank is 'strictly religious' and aimed at praying for peace in the region. Francis sought to temper expectations for his trip during his weekly Wednesday general audience. The Argentine Jesuit leaves on Saturday for a three-day visit to the Holy Land, where he will meet with Syrian and Palestinian refugees, the Jordanian, Israeli and Palestinian leaders and the chief rabbis of Israel and the mufti of Jerusalem. Tempering expectations: Pope Francis arrives for his general audience at St Peter's Square at the Vatican . The main reason for the visit is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the meeting between Pope Paul VI and the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians. Francis will meet in Jerusalem with the current Orthodox leader, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, whom he called his brother. Christianity was born in the region but the ancient community has dwindled to around two per cent of the population as economic hardship, violence and the bitter realities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have sent Christians searching for better opportunities overseas. The Christian exodus, underway for decades, has reached critical levels in recent years. Emigration is a central concern to local Vatican officials, who are trying to stave off the flight with offers of jobs, housing and scholarships. 'I am sad to think that maybe the time will come in which Christianity will disappear from this land,' said the Reverend Juan Solana, a Vatican envoy who oversees the Notre Dame center, a Jerusalem hotel for pilgrims that employs 150 locals, mostly Christians. Solana said he employs Christians to encourage them 'to stay here, to love this land, to be aware of their particular vocation to be the witnesses of Christianity in this land.' Pope Francis kisses a man on a wheelcher as he greets the crowd after his general audience at St Peter's Square . A faithful holds up a poster of Pope Francis during the weekly general audience in St Peter's Square at the Vatican . The Christian exodus is taking place across the Middle East. Jordan, where Pope Francis will begin his three-day trip Saturday, has thousands of Christian refugees from war-torn Syria and Iraq. For the Church, the phenomenon is particularly heartbreaking in the cradle of Christianity. According to Christian tradition, Jesus was born in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, spent much of his life in Nazareth and the northern Galilee region of Israel, and was crucified and resurrected in Jerusalem. The pope said in a November speech that 'we will not be resigned to think about the Middle East without Christians,' lamenting that they 'suffer particularly from the consequences of the tensions and conflicts underway' across the region. Christians in the Holy Land have dwindled from over 10 percent of the population on the eve of Israel's founding to between two and three per cent today, according to the local Roman Catholic church. The decline began with high Jewish immigration and Christian emigration after the 1948 war surrounding Israel's establishment, and has been abetted by continued emigration and a low birthrate among Christians who stay. Representatives of the indigenous peoples of the world association The Spirit of the Planet attend Pope Francis's general audience . Francis will meet in Jerusalem with the current Orthodox leader, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, whom he called his brother . Israeli restrictions in the occupied West Bank have also persuaded Christians to leave. The concrete and fence barrier Israel built to keep out Palestinian attackers has choked cities like Bethlehem and separated Palestinians from their farmlands. Many Palestinian Christians are prohibited from entering Jerusalem except during holidays. Israeli-Palestinian violence has also pushed people to leave, and instances of Islamic extremism, particularly in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, have made some Christians feel unwelcome in some cases, though relations between Palestinian Christians and Muslims are generally friendly. West Bank Christians are preparing to share some of these grievances with Pope Francis, and artisans are fashioning a cross with cement pieces of Israel's barrier for the Palestinian president to give the pope. Pope Francis will meet Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I . The Holy Land: The Holy Sepulchre church in Jerusalem, Israel . Elias Abumohor, a 44-year-old environmental engineer whose family was chosen to have an audience with Francis, says he will tell the pope about his lands in an area partly owned by the Vatican where Israel is planning to route its barrier. An estimated 80 per cent of Christian Palestinians live abroad, says the local Roman Catholic church, where they have had particular success in replanting themselves in Latin America, the United States and Europe. About 38,000 Palestinian Christians live in the West Bank, 2,000 in Gaza, and 10,000 in Jerusalem, according to the local Roman Catholic church. Israel has 130,000 Arab Christians. There are also nearly 200,000 non-native Christians in Israel, including Christians who moved from the former Soviet Union because of Jewish family ties, guest workers and African migrants. The Reverend Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the custodian of the Roman Catholic Church's Holy Land properties, said the native Christians who have left are middle-class and well-educated, some of the most vital members of the community. The Custodian of the Holy Land is one of the top property owners in the region. Its schools, guest houses and other institutions employ about 1,000 people, about 90 percent of them local Christians, Pizzaballa said. The church also offers 350 scholarships a year for Christians, mostly university students, reserving two-thirds for those who commit to staying in the Holy Land, he said. In recent decades, the Church has built 60 apartments in the West Bank city of Ramallah and rented them to Christians at a discounted rate, said the Rev. Raed Abusahlia, Ramallah's parish priest. Last year, the Church bought land to build 72 new apartments for Christians in an Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem, and there are similar projects in Bethlehem and in the village of Birzeit, he said. Properties abandoned by Christian emigres over the years have become a battleground for local priests seeking to keep a Christian presence in the Holy Land. In the West Bank, many Christians left without selling their homes and land, hoping they might one day return. In some cases, squatters - Muslims and Christians - have occupied these homes and asserted ownership of lands, said the Rev. Ibrahim Shomali, the parish priest of Bethlehem's sister city, Beit Jala. Maha Abu Dayyeh, a Palestinian Christian, said she came back from visiting her daughter in Sweden last year to find a Muslim family had taken over her mother's old house and thrown out the furniture. She said men threatened her son if she did anything to fight it. 'It will cost us only one bullet,' she said they told her son. She indicated the squatters' motives were more criminal than religious. Shomali said he is helping Christians like Abu Dayyeh fight for their property in court. He has also recruited local Christians to purchase a half dozen abandoned homes to keep them in Christian hands. 'As a Christian community, it's important to witness Jesus Christ in his land,' Shomali said. 'If we keep the houses, you keep the Christians here.'","Pope tried to temper expectations for his trip in his weekly address .

Sisters in New York's Midtown district - a favorite among celebrities like Naomi Campbell and Cameron Diaz - as a model for a story about the salon, showing a step-by-step transformation. Eight hours later, she claims she left 'terrorized' looking like an 'ugly, horrible monster'. The Brazilian national said her hair was in her hands after the treatment, with her scalp burned, stinging and itching, and part of it numb, according to The New York Daily News. She is now suing the co-owner of the W. 57th St. parlor, Jonice Padhilha, and the hairdresser that worked on her, Antonio Luis Rosa, who she claims was on drugs at the time. 'Terrorized': Myrella Ikeda, a Brazilian citizen who lives in Maryland, is suing J.

She said what happened after has changed her hair forever . Ikeda is seeking $3 million in damages. The incident is alleged to have occurred in 2011 and destroyed her potential modelling career and left her with depression, according to the personal injury lawsuit filed in Manhattan Federal Court.

Ikeda’s hair grew back thinner, uneven and less lustrous than before, the lawsuit alleges. The lawsuit claims Ikeda lost two years of her life as a result, refusing to leave the house . “She could no longer think of a career in cinema, television or photography. 'She had to give up work, study and opportunities, all her life became completely disorganized,” the lawsuit claims. 'Time passed, and Ikeda lost more than two critical years of her life, with no way to bring it back.' J. Sisters have not commented. In the lawsuit, Ikeda says that Padhilha called her after the incident and apologized, saying Rosa was on drugs. The state of her hair caused her caused her to 'lose motivation for everything'. J.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A panel of federal appellate judges has ordered the state of Missouri to halt the execution of a death row inmate tonight, which would have been the first in the nation following a botched lethal injection in Oklahoma. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday cited concerns about Russell Bucklew's rare medical condition, which raised the risk of 'unnecessary pain and suffering by the inmate.' Bucklew, 46, had been scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection at 12.01am Wednesday for killing a southeast Missouri man in front of his children during a violent crime spree in 1996. After the murder, Bucklew raped his ex-girlfriend and shot at a state trooper in a police chase. Spared: An appeals court stayed the execution of Russell Bucklew, pictured, saying that the state of Missouri has failed to prove that the convicted killer would not be subjected to pain and suffering  caused by his rare medical condition during lethal injection . His attorneys, Lindsay Runnels and . Cheryl Pilate, had asked the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to halt . the execution, citing concerns about Missouri's secretive process of . purchasing the execution drug pentobarbital and worries that Bucklew . could suffer during injection because of a rare medical condition. ‘The . state does not have the right to inflict extreme, torturous pain during . an execution,’ Pilate said before the appellate court’s ruling. ‘We . still hope that Mr. Bucklew's grave medical condition and compromised . airway will persuade the governor or a court to step back from this . extremely risky execution.’ Less . than eight hours before lethal injection Tuesday, the court of appeals ruled 2-1 to stay Bucklew's execution, writing in the decision that the state has failed to disprove Bucklew's claim that his medical condition could cause him pain and suffering during injection. 'Bucklew's unrebutted medical evidence demonstrates the requisite sufficient likelihood of unnecessary pain and suffering beyond the constitutionally permissible amount inherent in all executions,' the ruling reads. 'The irreparable harm to Bucklew is great in comparison to the harm to the state from staying the execution.' Cheryl Pilate, Bucklew's attorney, told NBC News they were 'thrilled' that the appeals court recognized the gravity of her client's condition. It was not immediately clear Tuesday evening if the state would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to vacate the stay of execution. Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat and a proponent of the death penalty, said that . while he is considering Bucklew's clemency request, he hasn't seen a . reason to intervene. ‘This . guy committed very, very heinous crimes, and while it's a difficult and . challenging part of this job, we'll continue to move forward unless a . court says otherwise,’ Nixon said Monday. In . a separate appeal filed Tuesday to the U.S. Supreme Court, Bucklew . claimed corrections staff seized and destroyed information that he . wanted to include in his clemency petition to Nixon. A . spokesman for Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster offered no comment . but cited a court document in which the state denies taking or . destroying anything pertinent to the clemency request.Bucklew's attorney said they also have appealed a separate ruling denying their request to record the execution on video. Victim: Michael Sanders, pictured, was shot and killed by Bucklew in front of his two sons. Stephanie Pruitt and her two daughters, who had been staying with Sanders, also witnessed the killing . Bucklew suffers from a congenital condition known as cavernous hemangioma that causes damaged blood vessels and tumors in his head, brain, neck, and throat. His attorneys say he could experience great suffering during the execution process. He told AP in a phone interview Friday that he often bleeds from the eyes and ears. He has constant pain in the face that requires pain medication every six hours. In light of his condition and the botched April execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma, Bucklew said he's worried about what will happen to him. 'I'm worried it could be painful,' Bucklew said. 'I'm worried about being brain-dead. I understand the family (of the victim) wants closure, but we're victimizing my family here, too.' Bucklew's attorneys have also cited concerns about Missouri's secretive procurement of the execution drug. Lethal injection: Former Cape Girardeau county prosecutor Morley Swingle has called Bucklew a 'homicidal Energiser bunny' In March 1996, Bucklew tracked down his estranged girlfriend, Stephanie Pruitt, at the Cape Girardeau mobile home of Michael Sanders. Pruitt and her two young daughters were staying there with Sanders and his two young sons. Bucklew shot Sanders in front of Pruitt and the kids, killing him. He grabbed Pruitt, took her to a remote area, and raped her. When a Missouri state trooper spotted Bucklew later that night on Interstate 55, a chase began. Bucklew shot at the trooper and missed. The trooper shot back and grazed Bucklew's head. He later escaped from jail, hid inside the home of Pruitt's mother and attacked her with a hammer. She was able to get away and Bucklew was caught a short time later. Bucklew said he was remorseful for the crime, and said he plans to revise his will to provide money for a college fund for the sons of the victim. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, in a court response last Thursday, questioned why Bucklew waited until now to raise those concerns. 'There is no good reason Bucklew could not have brought his current suit six months ago, or six years ago,' Koster wrote. Former Cape Girardeau County . prosecutor Morley Swingle said he has no sympathy for him. He earlier referred to Bucklew as a 'homicidal Energiser bunny' when speaking to the Guardian. 'I . truly believe he's probably the most evil person I ever prosecuted . because he's such a pure sociopath,' Swingle said. 'When he had it in . his mind to hurt somebody, you just couldn't stop him.' Swingle said concerns about the pentobarbital used in the execution 'are grasping at straws. It's a very deadly poison and when they give it to him, he'll die.' Bucklew's execution would be the seventh in Missouri since November using pentobarbital, and there have been no apparent problems with the previous six. Botched execution: Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett, pictured, took 43 minutes to die after a lethal injection went awry in April . It would also be the first death penalty carried out in the U.S. since April 29, when Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett writhed on the gurney, gritted his teeth, and moaned before dying of an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after the start of his execution. A doctor inside the death chamber during the execution reported that Lockett's vein collapsed and some of the lethal drugs were absorbed into his tissue or leaked out. The incident prompted renewed concern about lethal injection in an era when many states, including Oklahoma and Missouri, have changed drugs they administer and refuse to disclose the source of the execution drugs. Oklahoma put on hold a second execution scheduled for the same night as Lockett's death, while the state investigates what happened. A Texas inmate was scheduled to be put to death this week but a federal appeals court granted a stay of execution so his attorneys can pursue appeals arguing that he is mentally impaired and ineligible for the death penalty.","Russell Bucklew, 46, tracked down his estranged girlfriend, Stephanie Pruitt, at the home of Michael Sanders in 1996 .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A retired British couple who attempted to take their own lives are to be extradited to the U.S. today, their solicitors have said. Grandparents Paul and Sandra Dunham were taken to hospital last Thursday after they took a drug overdose the night before they were due to hand themselves in to police before being taken to U.S. marshals at Heathrow Airport. The couple, both 58, were remanded in custody at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Friday after Senior District Judge Howard Riddle concluded they had taken the drugs deliberately to avoid or delay their extradition to face fraud charges. Charges: Paul and Sandra Dunham, from Northampton, are to be extradited to the US today, their lawyer said . House: The Dunhams were found by police officers at their detached home in Northampton last week . Journalists who were expecting the Dunhams to give a statement called police when they did not appear . This morning their solicitors, extradition specialists Kaim Todner, confirmed the couple were set to be extradited to Maryland. It is understood Mr Dunham, who is accused of over-claiming £600,000 expenses from an American firm, is in Wandsworth prison, while Mrs Dunham, who is accused of aiding and abetting, is in HMP Holloway. The couple lost a High Court battle last month against extradition to stand trial over fraud charges relating to Mr Dunham’s company, Pace. The failed High Court case heard Mr . Dunham had suffered several mini-strokes and mental health problems, and . Mrs Dunham was suffering from depression. Mr Dunham, who was chief executive, president and a 20 per cent shareholder in the American company, which manufactured soldering irons for the electronics industry, was indicted on 13 counts of fraud and money laundering by a grand jury in Greenbelt, Maryland, in December 2011. Mrs Dunham is accused of eight counts of fraud for allegedly aiding and abetting him. The couple deny any wrongdoing. The retired British couple were rushed to hospital after they were overdosed on medication at home last week . Journalists due to take a statement outside the Dunhams’ property in Northampton last Thursday alerted police when the couple did not answer the door. Officers forced the door open and contacted paramedics, who arrived in two ambulances and took the couple to Northampton General Hospital, where they spent the night. The couple, who have five grandchildren, said they attempted the suicide pact after being told Theresa May had cancelled a planned meeting with their MP Andrea Leadsom. The case has caused anger over the use of the Extradition Act to haul them across the Atlantic for trial for what their supporters say amounts to a civil dispute. The couple’s solicitor, Karen Todner, said she believed the extradition would happen today, and criticised the British government for allowing it. She added: . 'Mr and Mrs Dunham are a hard-working couple from Northamptonshire who . strenuously deny the allegations against them. Nevertheless, this . country is forcibly sending them to America to face trial in a justice . system where plea arrangements are effectively forced upon people. Controversy: The Dunhams' case has caused anger over the use of the Extradition Act to haul them across the Atlantic for what some say is a civil case . 'I understand David Cameron has recently stated that the Abu Hamza conviction shows that we ought to be extraditing people to America with greater expedition. 'What in fact this case shows is that Mr Abu Hamza should have stood trial in the United Kingdom and faced British justice. 'How many people like Mr and Mrs Dunham have to be extradited before this Government will uphold the promises they made whilst in opposition to change this treaty with America?' Last week, Mr Dunham spoke from his hospital bed of his despair at being taken to America. He said: ‘White collar crime has a 98 per cent chance of going to a plea bargain, so... somewhere down the line someone is either going to offer us a ridiculously long prison sentence or a plea bargain. 'We could easily be in the U.S. for six or eight years, [meaning] we would return to the UK in our mid-sixties, with no money, no jobs and no home.

"By . James  Nye . Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, has announced plans to accelerate its expansion into China by adding as many as 110 stores over the next three years, resulting in an almost $100 million investment. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based firm wants to open the new stores in the world's second-largest economy at the same time as closing 30 under-performing outlets over the next 18 months. China is key to Wal-Mart's international ambitions but it has stumbled in a market where consumers value safe and authentic food over the low prices for which the retailer is known. Scroll down for video . Expansion: The Zhaohui outlet of Walmart Stores which is to be closed in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province . The U.S. retailer, which operates about 400 units in China, said last October that it would open up to 110 facilities in the country between 2014 and 2016 and was looking to close 15-30 others over the next 18 months as part of a rationalization process in the country. Its local rival, Sun Art Retail Group Ltd, said in March it would continue to maintain steady new store expansion after China's top hypermarket operator posted a 15.2 percent rise in 2013 net profit with an expanding store network helping it shrug off an economic slowdown. 'China presents one of the biggest opportunities for us around the world to grow our stores and clubs, so its really important,' Doug McMillon, president of Wal-Mart’s international business, said today in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Wal-Mart already has 400 outlets across China and Wal-Mart is looking to develop a larger presence in the country’s largest center's while building bigger stores in third- and fourth-tier cities. Re-adjustment: Wal-Mart Stores Inc is changing its approach, closing some big-box stores that never quite caught on with locals . Wal-Mart's competition in China also comes from local independent traders and Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director at China Market Research Group said, 'They haven't been as quick to react to competition and local players are able to cater to customers' preferences faster than Wal-Mart.' Sun Art is China’s largest hypermarket operator, with a 14 percent share of the 574 $94 billion industry last year, while Wal-Mart is joint second along with China Resources with 11 percent market-share. Wal-Mart plans to ramp up expansion in smaller cities outside Beijing and Shanghai. The company is also investing in distribution and will add a new center in the Northeastern city of Shenyang next month. 'We have supercenters and we have Sam’s Club; we’ll be investing in both formats, as well as in distribution areas to help us improve in areas such as fresh food,' said McMillon to Bloomberg Television. The company expects to add about 19,000 jobs in China over the next three years.","The world's largest retailer to expand its operation in China over the next two-years .

"By . Leon Watson . Tampa Bay have become the fifth NFL team to get served with a lawsuit from its cheerleaders, it emerged today. Papers were filed against the Buccaneers by former cheerleader Manouchcar Pierre-Val accusing them of violating federal wage law. It follows similar actions against the Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, Oakland Raiders and New York Jets filed by cheerleaders claiming they were underpaid. Manouchcar Pierre-Val alleges that she is owed at least minimum wage for more than 500 hours she worked for the team . In the suit, Pierre-Val's attorney . Kimberly Woods alleges many of the same facts as those that preceded it . including unpaid promotional appearances, multiple practices per week, . and several hundred hours worked for the team, all for a flat per-game . wage. Pierre-Val, 25, is a registered nurse from Orlando who cheered for the Bucs during the 2012 to 2013 season, Deadspin.com reported. During that time, her attorney said, she was paid $100 per game but worked many more unpaid hours leading cheerleading clinics, visiting charity events, posing for swimsuit calendars and practicing. 'If you do the math,' Woods said, 'you see she earned less than $2 per hour — while the minimum wage in Florida was $7.67.' Former cheerleader Manouchcar Pierre-Val (pictured) is suing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . Pierre-Val¿s suit was filed as a class action, giving other cheerleaders for the team the option of joining the suit against the team . Since January, cheerleaders for the Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, Oakland Raiders and New York Jets have filed similar 'wage theft' suits . Woods also anticipated the 'you knew what you were getting into' defense, noting that one cannot waive her rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Pierre-Val is the only named plaintiff as of now and was paid $3,000 less than minimum wage during her one year with the team. Pierre-Val's attorney said she has spoken to other members of the Bucs' cheerleading squad who expressed interest in adding their names, but none have done so at this point .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A video has emerged showing the moment that a police officer allegedly kneed a law student so hard in the groin that he had to have a testicle removed, according to a political action group. Jeremy Martin, 24, was driving a carload of friends near the University of New Mexico campus, where he studies law, on April 24 when a police officer pulled him over, claiming he ran a stop sign. ProgressNowNM claimed it obtained video of the incident from the Albuquerque Police Department. It was captured by the lapel camera worn by the officer, Pablo Padilla, Progress said on its website. The video shows Martin standing beside his car with his hands out as the police officer approaches and orders him to sit down on the curb. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: Progress Now shared a video apparently showing the moment a student was kicked by a cop and left him needing a testicle removed. Jeremy Martin can be seen as the officer approaches . Escalating: When Martin refuses to sit on the ground so the officer can carry out a field sobriety test, the officer threatens to stun and subdue him . Martin repeatedly interrupts him and moves around before agreeing to sit. The officer then says that Martin told him he'd had three beers, the video shows. When Martin stands up, he ignores the officer's requests for him to sit down. Martin repeatedly asks him to let the other friends to drive the truck away. A scuffle then ensues as the officer tries to subdue the driver, who says: 'Don't kick me in the nuts!' The man is forced to the ground and road rash can be seen on his face in a photograph taken afterwards, KOB noted. MailOnline has requested a comment from the Albuquerque Police Department about the video, but it has not yet been answered. 'Attack': During a scuffle, the officer apparently knees him in the groin, which Martin grabs defensively . Knocked down: He is then pinned to the ground by the officer and arrested on misdemeanor charges . Martin was booked on misdemeanor charges of marijuana possession and DWI. His lawyer said he was taken to Presbyterian Hospital for emergency surgery to have his testicle removed after it was 'shattered'. A police report filed by officer Padilla claimed that Martin appeared to be intoxicated and admitted to having three beers after he was pulled over. Martin went . through a series of field sobriety tests then the officer asked him to . sit on the curb. However, according to the report, Martin resisted. Martin's attorney, Sam Bregman, told KOB4 that the officer reacted in the worst possible way. 'This officer felt the necessity to knee him so . directly and with so much blunt force that it shattered his testicle,' he said. Aftermath: Martin's mugshot show his bloodied face following the altercation with the police officer in April . Suit: Martin, pictured, is filing a lawsuit against the officers involved in the incident, his lawyer said . His . face is visibly injured in his mug shot, and while the police report . mentions those injuries it does not mention his testicle. Bregman is now filing suit against the officers involved. 'How does a DWI investigation with a first year law . student - when he absolutely did nothing to provoke the officer - . result in the shattering of his testicle and emergency surgery to remove . it?' Bregman asked. In Martin's favor is that the police report contains several inconsistencies.

"By . Ted Thornhill . We all know that working in an office environment can lead to disagreements over the smallest things, but one man has managed to capture the workplace as never seen before. Whether it's enduring an appraisal, or simply day dreaming at your desk, a quirky set of pictures use miniature figurines to note the trials and tribulations of the working world. Taken by photographer and brand strategist, Derrick Lin, 38, from Columbus, Ohio, each scene gives a snap shot into the everyday goings on of a busy marketing agency. Mini marvels: Tiny chimp figures recreate 2001 A Space Odyssey on Mr Lin's desk (left)  while men in boiler suits clean the office fridge (right) Rug's life: Mini figurines appearing to farm a piece of fabric on Mr Lin's desk - illustrating the fact that they always get to know their clients' products . 'If I have to listen one more time to my coworkers fabulous vacations!' Mini figurines sunbath on Mr Lin's desk . Sometimes feedback is hard to handle: Mini figures involved in a medical emergency . After employers at US advertising company, Resource, decided to host an internal Instagram content, creative thinker, Derrick, set out to create pictures that every office worker could relate to. It's safe to say that Derrick won the contest and what started as in-house project has now evolved into an ongoing series. Using miniature figurines normally found in model train sets to stage different scenes, each photograph is then accompanied with a telling caption that summarises a particular moment in time, be it success or failure. Thirsty work: The figure on the left illustrates the world-wide yearning for coffee breaks, while the scene on the right represents how workers often daydream during their busiest moments .

Luckily, his colleagues don't seem to mind his lunch time antics and often volunteer themselves as a prop for the next picture. Mr Lin said: ‘I have always been fascinated by all things miniature and by small details so it occurred to me that the miniature figures, with the contrast of their size and their lively poses, could be a great medium to express our many emotions. ‘In the advertising industry, every day moves fast and sometimes it can be stressful, our work days are never short of those little moments any agency person will immediately understand.

"By . Damien Gayle . Don't use your mobile phone in public in Rio. And if you do, and someone tries to nick it, don't argue. Muggers often kill victims who resist. These are the warnings residents in Brazil have offered to football fans who will be heading to their country for the World Cup this summer. The advice comes as the country was pitched into near anarchy today after thousands of police went on strike to demand a near doubling of pay. Scroll down for video. Policemen stand guard inside the Maracana stadium: World Cup travellers have been given fresh warnings over safety in Brazil, as the country's civil police staged a one-day walkout over pay . Muggings, robberies, kidnappings and gang violence make Brazil one of the most criminalised countries in the world, with about 28 murders per 100,000 residents. Meanwhile, massive inequality and dissatisfaction with authorities have led the Foreign Office to warn travellers that 'protests continue to take place regularly, often without warning,' in major cities. In travel advice issued last night, the FCO adds: 'Levels of crime and violence are high, particularly in major cities. 'You should be particularly vigilant before and during the festive and Carnival periods,' as well as, presumably, the World Cup. It's against that backdrop that the nation's civil police, who deal with criminal inquiries, have staged a one day walk out just 22 days before the start of the tournament, one of the world's biggest sporting events. They are demanding pay rises of up to 80 per cent, BBC News reports. Officers have withheld their labour in 14 states, including Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Bahia, Pernambuco and Amazonas - all locations of World Cup host stadiums. Dangerous game: A man holding two hostages inside a bus in Rio peers out of a window to negotiate his surrender. Tourists have been given particular warnings about a crime wave on Rio's public transport system . But even when police are not staging union action, Brazil's cities can be hazardous to unwary visitors. Tips from embassies, police sources and Rio residents on how to avoid becoming a victim of crime during the World Cup include: . Muggings on public transport, at beaches and in popular tourist areas are on the rise in Rio de Janeiro, reversing recent gains in security as it has geared up to host seven World Cup games and the 2016 Olympics. Muggings on Rio's bus fleet, the main form of public transport in this metropolis of 12 million, doubled over the past year, the state's ISP security statistics agency says. More than 420 incidents were reported in January alone, compared with 195 in the same month a year earlier, returning such incidents to their peak level of four years ago. The phenomenon dovetails with a general rise in muggings and robberies. In the first three months of the year, the number of muggings reported in the city's marquee Copacabana district rose nearly 60 per cent in a year. Commuters ride a bus in Rio: The situation in Rio's public transport has gotten so bad that state lawmakers have proposed the creation of a specialised police battalion for the city's fleet of nearly 9,000 buses . Security expert Paulo Storani, who spent 30 years as a Rio cop, says violent crime has risen in at least half of the 12 World Cup host cities, a rise who attributes to a feeling of impunity. 'People do not recognize the authority of government officials, and as a result criminals are more at ease to commit their crimes because they feel they will not be arrested or punished,' he stold the Associtated Press. The FCO advises British tourists travelling to Brazil that 'violence and crime can occur anywhere and often involves firearms'. It warns of an increase in robberies at cash machines and calls on holidaymakers to 'be vigilant while using public transport, especially during rush hour.' Police stand outside the Maracana stadium: Security expert Paulo Storani, who spent 30 years as a police officer on the streets of Rio, says violent crime has risen in at least half of the 12 World Cup host cities . The situation in Rio's public . transport has gotten so bad that state lawmakers have proposed the . creation of a specialised police battalion for the city's fleet of . nearly 9,000 buses. Rio Governor Luiz Fernando Pezao reportedly favours . the proposal but it needs to clear several more legislative hurdles. Mr Pezao characterized the city's fight against criminality as 'a war.' Rio state's top security official, Jose Mariano Beltrame, has responded to the spike in crime by beefing up the number of officers who will be on duty during the June 12 to July 13 World Cup by around 20 per cent. The spike in crime comes despite a six-year-old 'pacification' programme which has brought police to 'favela' shantytowns. The campaign initially saw crime fall, and Rio residents began taking walks after dark again. But the resurgence in crime is driving many back into a siege mentality and fueling fears of problems when an estimated 600,000 foreigners travel to Brazil for the World Cup. A team of British police officers will be posted to Brazil during the World Cup. Six bobbies are being sent to South America 'to offer support and advice to Brazilian police and local authorities' and help protect England fans. Chief Superintendent Rachel Barber, from South Yorkshire Police, will lead the small team during the tournament, which thousands of British fans are expected to attend. Deputy Chief Constable Andy Holt, who will be the overall commander from the UK, said: 'British police are among the best in the world at policing football matches and it is testament to their work with supporters' groups and others involved in the game that serious football violence has declined. At the last World Cup in 2010 there were only seven arrests of England fans, none of them for football-related violence. 'It is also important that fans play their part in keeping themselves and others safe - by avoiding protests or confrontation, keeping personal belongings safe and leaving plenty of time to get to match venues. 'Very importantly, if you are the subject of a football banning order, you must surrender your passport to your nominated police station by May 31. If you attempt to travel to Brazil, we will be keeping an eye out for you and in the very unlikely event that you are not picked up at a port or airport, our intelligence team in Brazil will spot you and there will be serious legal consequences.' It's not just robberies that have made public transport in Rio dangerous. A year ago, the gang rape of an American student aboard a public transit van made headlines around the world. The student and her French boyfriend hailed the van in Copacabana. The van's driver, money-taker and another man soon forced the other passengers to disembark, tied up the Frenchman and subjected the woman to what a police investigator described as an all-night-long 'party of evil'. Although investigators quickly tracked down those responsible, it emerged that police had failed to follow up on earlier reports by Brazilian women who were raped by the trio under similar circumstances. The issue of sexual violence in public transport captured headlines again earlier this year, this time in Sao Paulo, which is hosting the World Cup's opening match. Authorities there detained several men for allegedly accosting women on subways and buses, sometimes filming them with cellphones and posting the videos of the molestations on social media. Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's first woman president, said on Twitter that such acts 'shame our society.' While it's unclear if the rate of sexual assault has increased in the past year, the high-profile attacks have fueled the widespread perception that using public transport is dangerous. Repeated industrial action by the very men and women who are supposed to be keeping Rio's streets safe has not helped. However, it is only the civil police who will not be working today. Brazil's highly armed military police, who patrol the streets, and its federal police, in charge of borders and airports promise they are not planning any strike until after the World Cup. And the government pledges that even it they did walk out, authorities have contingency plans in place. Brazil's Big Events Secretary Roberto Alzir told the BBC: 'There is no climate for a general [police] strike now in Rio de Janeiro. 'Even if that was to go ahead, we would be prepared for that.' By ASSOCIATED PRESS . Brazilians have high hopes that the World Cup will give their country a big boost. That includes soccer fan Jarbas Meneghini, a 46-year-old mechanic who has carved out a side business of making replicas of the tournament's iconic trophy.

He started selling his replicas two years later and he's still at it, producing a small version that he sells for the equivalent of $11 and a large one that goes for $23. Most of his sales are done by phone or through his Facebook page. Sometimes he delivers orders to clients by meeting them during games at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium. Mr Meneghini doesn't say how many he has sold, other than to say sales have been slow. He says he has used part of the proceeds to fix up his street so it will look nice during the World Cup.

"By . Snejana Farberov . An elderly Miami woman was riding her bicycle Saturday afternoon when she was viciously attacked and mauled by four pit bulls. Maria Sanchez, 67, says if it were not for her four 'angels' - Good Samaritans who came to her aid - she would have been killed on the spot by the dogs. The victim was rushed to Kendall Hospital with chunks of flesh missing from her lip, nose and feet. On Tuesday, Ms Sanchez underwent surgery but her doctors say they may have to amputate one of her chewed-up toes. Scroll down for video . Scarred but alive: Maria Sanchez, 67, was left with chunks of flesh missing from her lip, nose and feet after an encounter with four pit bulls in Miami . Four-legged bandits: These animals attacked Ms Sanchez and began tearing at her . Speaking from her hospital bed Tuesday, the heavily bandaged, scarred 67-year-old woman recalled to NBC6 how she was biking in the Cutler Bay section of Miami Saturday afternoon when she spotted a pack of dogs eying her. ‘It’s not like, “Oh, little puppies.” No, I knew they were going to kill me the minute I saw them,’ Sanchez said. ‘I looked at them; I knew they were going to get me.’ The animals, identified by the Miami-Dade Animal Services as pit bulls, lunged at Sanchez, knocked her to the ground, and then proceeded to tear at her body. Four neighbors, among them John Green, overheard the woman's desperate cries for help and ran over to chase away the animals. Selfless act: John Green (left) was one of four Good Samaritans who put themselves in harm's way to rescue Sanchez from the out-of-control dogs . Greenhouse: Police determined that the four dogs escaped from this home in the Cutler Bay section of Miami, where officers found marijuana plants being grown . 'They were eating this lady up, you know,' said Green, who came unarmed but tried to distract the out-of-control canines. The other three Good Samaritans came at the dogs with baseball bats, but the pit bulls continued biting her ever as they were being struck. Police officers who responded to the scene determined that the four dogs escaped from a house in Cutler Bay. When investigators came up to the residence, they allegedly detected marijuana odor coming from the inside. A search of the premises yielded several pot plants.

"By . Snejana Farberov . An Arizona woman was charged with felony child abuse after police say she forced her boyfriend’s 3-year-old daughter to eat her own feces as a disciplinary measure. Nicole Renee Candelaria, 27, had her initial court appearance Monday and her bond was set at $5,400. Ms Candelaria was arrested Saturday in Tempe. Authorities say she is the primary caregiver for her boyfriend’s three girls, ages 3 and 5, while he is at work. Stomach-turning:  Nicole Candelaria, 27, is accused of forcing her boyfriend's 3-year-old daughter to eat her own excrement as punishment for defecating in the bathtub . Cruel punishment: Candelaria, pictured here with two of her boyfriend's three daughters, allegedly held the girl down on the toilet seat and put soap in her mouth . Court records show Candelaria became upset Friday when the 3-year-old child in her care defecated in the bathtub and the 27-year-old woman allegedly forced her to eat the excrement as punishment for the mishap. The victim also accused her caretaker of forcibly holding her down on the toilet seat and putting soap in her mouth. The alleged incident took place while the three sisters were staying with their father in Tempe for a week, ABC15 reported. When the girls returned home Friday night, the 3-year-old complained to her mother about Candelaria. Baby sitter: Candelaria often looked after the 3-year-old twins and their 5-year-old sister (right) when the girls' father was at work . Her version: The 27-year-old told police the alleged 3-year-old victim lied often and denied forcing her to eat feces or holding her down by force . The child's story was corroborated by her 3-year-old twin and their 5-year-old sister. The 3-year-old girl was taken to a hospital for a check-up where a forensic medical exam revealed that she had bruises on her back, chest and legs consistent with forcible holding. Doctors also found that the toddler suffered an injury to her vagina, the cause of which remained unknown. Truth comes out: The 3-year-old's twin sister and older sibling both corroborated her tale of abuse, and a medical exam determined that the child suffered bruises all over her body . When questioned by police about the abuse claims, Candelaria, whose Facebook profile states she works at 'Mommyhood Inc,' replied that the 3-year-old victim 'lies often' and denied the feces-eating incident altogether. Ms Candelaria has since been released from jail on bond. She is due back in court May 23.","Nicole Candelaria, 27, charged with felony child abuse in Arizona excrement-eating incident .

"By . Julian Robinson . Baby elephants were shocked with electric cattle prods and hit with bull hooks during cruel training sessions at a South African wildlife park, it has been claimed. The abuse, which included chaining and roping calves and juvenile animals, was captured in 'horrific' video footage taken at Elephants of Eden in the Eastern Cape, according to a prominent animal rights group. Trainers used the methods 'to break the animals' spirit so that they would obey humans,' the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) claims. A frame from the video shows a man riding on to the back of a young elephant. The animal's back leg is chained down while its front leg is roped up and stretched forward . 'The elephants show signs of crippling injuries with severely swollen legs and feet, debilitating abscesses and wounds,' National Council of SPCA's inspector Wendy Willson said. The video was taken on the premises of the park where the beasts were being trained for elephant-back safaris, she said. 'The calculated and premeditated cruelty of this nature that took place at this facility is a far cry from the loving sanctuary image that Elephants of Eden/Knysna Elephant Park like to portray,' she added. The 'horrific' video footage also appears to show gruesome injuries to the young elephants, according to The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty . A baby elephant sinks to the ground as two men watch on holding sticks. According to a prominent animal rights group, the images were captured at the Elephants of Eden park in the Eastern Cape of South Africa . The SPCA said it had laid cruelty charges with the police against Elephants of Eden, the Knysna Elephant Park and their directors and management. If the case is brought to court and the directors and managers are convicted, they could face sentences of up to three years in jail on each charge and lose all their elephants.. Knysna Elephant Park, which owned Elephants of Eden (EOE) until selling it a year ago, denied responsibility for the abuse, which it said took place around six years ago. The park said in a statement that the abused elephants were being housed at EOE on behalf of another safari park owner and were under the control of his staff when the incidents occurred. The animals had been beaten by handlers after one of their members had been killed by an elephant, the park said in a statement. A baby elephant seemingly buckles under the weight of the man on its back as ropes are lashed on to its feet . 'Once this abuse was discovered by the EOE management, immediate emergency actions were taken to remove the elephants from an unsafe environment and brought to Knysna Elephant Park and the EOE staff were immediately dealt with and dismissed. 'At the Knysna Elephant Park these traumatised elephants received specialised veterinary care and a safe environment in which to recover,' the statement said, adding that the allegations had only surfaced now as a result of a 'malicious' campaign by the other safari park owner. The SPCA was initially denied access to . the park for an inspection and had to call for assistance from the . police, the SPCA said. 'In simple terms, due to the size, intelligence and nature of elephants, training most often takes place through domination, and the breaking of the elephant's spirit,' Wendy Wilson added. The SPCA said it had laid cruelty charges with the police against Elephants of Eden, the Knysna Elephant Park and their directors and management . The elephants were showing 'signs of crippling injuries with severely swollen legs and feet, debilitating abscesses and wounds' according to the animal rights group . 'In order to dominate or force one's will on to an animal such as the elephant, force needs to be applied and thus is a recipe for abuse. 'The captive elephant interaction industry is a form of tourism driven by greed and without any conservation benefit,' she said. A growing number of people in South Africa and around the world have been injured or killed as a result of the rebellion of trained elephants kept in captivity, the SPCA statement said. 'Elephants of Eden and the Knysna Elephant Park are no exceptions - at these facilities two elephant handlers have been killed and others have been seriously injured.'","Elephants were abused 'so they would obey humans', welfare group claims .

Not content with driving around his home town of Newport, south Wales, Mr Norvill took the skipcar to the famous drag racing track Santa Pod Raceway in Bedfordshire where he broke the land speed record for a waste disposal unit. 'I took it down and they had sold out 15,000 tickets to watch us break the record - it was a massive rush,' he said.

Once attached to the base of the car the skip was painted in the colours of Mr Norvill's waste management company .

"By . Associated Press . On the eve of a critical Senate vote, the Obama administration signaled it will publicly reveal a secret memo describing its legal justification for using drones to kill U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism overseas. Two administration officials told The Associated Press that the Justice Department has decided not to appeal a court order requiring disclosure of a redacted version of the memo under the Freedom of Information Act. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The decision to release the documents comes a day before the Senate is to vote on advancing President Barack Obama's nomination of the memo's author, Harvard professor and former Justice Department official David Barron, to sit on the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Deadly: Remote-controlled drones like this one have been in service since at least 1995; the Predator drone, America's most often used model, carries two Hellfire anti-tank missiles . Serious: Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul was set to block the federal judicial confirmation of a former DOJ official who provided the White House with legal justification for killing terrorism-connected US citizens without due process . Controversial: Former Justice Department official David Barron, whose nomination to the federal bench has been on hold since last November, wrote the Obama White House's legal justification for extrajudicial drone strikes on US citizens . Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., had vowed to attempt to block Barron's confirmation with a filibuster if the documents were not made public. Paul issued a statement Tuesday saying he still opposes Barron's nomination. Wednesday's expected vote would allow the Senate to move ahead with a final vote on Barron on Thursday. ""I think we'll be OK,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said earlier Tuesday. Anwar al-Awlaki, an al-Qaeda leader born in the United States, was killed after being targeted by a drone strike in Yemen in September 2011. Some legal scholars and human rights activists complained that it was illegal for the U.S. to kill American citizens away from the battlefield without a trial. Some senators, including those in Obama's own party, have called for the public release of the memo before the final confirmation vote. The White House agreed under the pressure to show senators unredacted copies of all written legal advice written by Barron regarding the potential use of lethal force against U.S. citizens in counterterrorism operations. Until now, the administration has fought in court to keep the writings from public view. But administration officials said that Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. has decided not appeal an April 21 ruling requiring disclosure by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York and that Attorney General Eric Holder concurred with his opinion. Gone but not forgotten: Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to al-Qaeda in Yemen, was targeted and killed in a 2011 drone strike authorized by the Obama administration . Rand Paul talked on the US Senate floor for more than a half-day on March 6, 2013, opposing the nomination of John Brennan to lead the CIA because the White House wouldn't promise to take drone strikes against US citizens off the table . The release could take some time, since the redactions are subject to court approval. And the administration also is insisting that a classified ruling on the case also be redacted to protect information classified for national security, but not the legal reasoning, one of the officials said. The drone strike that killed al-Awlaki also killed another U.S. citizen, Samir Khan, an al-Qaeda propagandist. Al-Awlaki's 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman, was killed the following month in another drone attack. The American Civil Liberties Union and two reporters for The New York Times, Charlie Savage and Scott Shane, filed a FOIA suit. In January 2013, U.S. District Court Judge Colleen McMahon ruled that she had no authority to order the documents disclosed, although she chided the Obama administration for refusing to release them. But a three-judge appeals court panel noted that after McMahon ruled, senior government officials spoke about the subject. The panel rejected the government's claim that the court could not consider official disclosures made after McMahon's ruling, including a 16-page Justice Department white paper on the subject and public comments by Obama in May in which he acknowledged his role in the al-Awlaki killing, saying he had 'authorized the strike that took him out.'","Sen. Rand Paul threatened to filibuster a judicial nominee, former DOJ official David Barron,  unless the memo was released in its entirety .
Barron wrote the legal advice that gave the Obama administration the clearance to kill US citizens with drones if they are involved with terrorism .
Anwar al-Awlaki, an al-Qaeda leader born in the US, was killed by a 2011 US drone strike in Yemen, and three others have reportedly met the same fate .
The American Civil Liberties Union sued for the document after the Justice Department refused to comply with a Freedom Of Information Act request .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . China is already renowned for copying Western goods from trainers to champagne. Now it is building a replica reputation in the world of architecture, with miniature versions Mount Rushmore, the Egyptian pyramids and the Manhattan skyline - to name a few - springing up all over the country. The reproduced structures — also dubbed 'duplitecture' — can appear bizarre to outsiders but make sense to many in the country. 'I think it's a good thing. I can see things from places that I’ve never been,' said a man surnamed Fu, 32, sitting in a Chongqing park scattered with sculptures including Michelangelo's David, Rodin’s Thinker and the gigantic heads of four American presidents. Fabricating the Pharaohs: People walk past a copy of one of the Pyramids of Giza at a theme park in the Chinese city of Chongqing . And here's the real thing: The Sphinx is seen in front of the Pyramid of Chephren in Giza, Cairo, iconic landmarks which have inspired architecture in China . Elsewhere in the southwestern city, a set . of curved white buildings under construction have sparked controversy . for their striking resemblance to a Beijing development by star British . architect Zaha Hadid. Copying was 'something China does', a . retired judge said as she walked past the site, adding: 'I think it’s a . good thing — we can learn from the experience of others.' The director of Hadid's Beijing project was less positive, reportedly calling the property company 'pirates'. The . company has denied copying, telling news agency AFP that it had reached . an agreement with the original developer, which declined to comment . The . 'duplitecture' trend developed alongside China’s real estate boom in . recent decades, especially for creations conveying prestige and success, . said Bianca Bosker, the New York-based author of Original Copies: . Architectural Mimicry in Contemporary China. A slice of the Big Apple: A theme park in Chongqing features a condensed version of the famous New York skyline as China builds a reputation for replicas . The real Manhattan skyline: A 27-year-old woman surnamed Huang, who walked past the fake New York in Chongqing, said her compatriots should embrace their own heritage . Among the most eye-popping examples are a copy of the Austrian alpine village and Unesco World Heritage Site of Hallstatt in the southern province of Guangdong, which even the official news agency Xinhua called 'a bold example of China’s knock-off culture'. An assemblage of Parisian monuments . including the Eiffel Tower and a fountain from Versailles stand in . Hangzhou, as does a French village. Hebei . province has an imitation Sphinx, while outside Shanghai sits Thames . Town, an English-themed suburb featuring a statue of Winston Churchill, a . church from Bristol and lookalikes of guards at Buckingham Palace. The imitations are open to mockery, but Bosker says that such replicas provide an easy way to convey prestige on a huge scale. Cut down to size: A replica of Mount Rushmore featuring U.S. presidents (l-r) George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln in Chongqing . Towering landmark: The original features 60ft heads carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore in Keystone, South Dakota, in the United States . 'In the U.S., we see people who copy as unimaginative thieves. In China copiers have been viewed with more nuance — copying can be a sign of skill and it can also just be a really practical solution to a problem,' she told AFP. 'Developers wanted a way to brand their developments and the home owners wanted a way to brand their lifestyle and their economic success. 'And one of the easiest solutions to that was to copy architecture that was most emblematic of a kind of aristocratic and 'sophisticated'-seeming lifestyle,' she said, citing Versailles, Venice and the White House as popular models. That pragmatic streak also drives the . mass production of knockoffs including Italian handbags, Swiss watches, . French wine, Hollywood films and iPhones, while the southwestern city of . Kunming once even hosted a fake Apple store. In . Dafen, part of the boom town of Shenzhen next to Hong Kong, an army of . artists duplicate masterpieces ranging from Vincent van Gogh to Jackson . Pollock. Great Small of China: A woman walks along a replica of the Chinese landmark at a park in Chongqing. The reproduced structures are known by some as 'duplitecture' As far as the eye can see: The original Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that stretch for some 21,000km across the country . The fakes allow Chinese to enjoy what they could not otherwise afford, said a young man strolling at an amusement park in Chongqing featuring a miniature New York, Venice-like canals and Rio de Janeiro’s Christ the Redeemer statue rotating atop a ride. 'In terms of respecting others’ creativity, it’s not okay. But for a China that’s still developing, for a certain time there’s a use for it,' he said. 'When China’s economy becomes developed enough, then there won’t be a market for copied goods.' Even so, the rampant imitation raises questions of national pride in a country boasting a rich history and now regaining global clout. In March, Renmin University president Chen Yulu urged his countrymen to 'refrain from copying European architectural styles and work harder to promote local culture', Xinhua paraphrased him as saying, while itself warning of an 'eerie copycat architectural landscape'. 'Pirates': These curved buildings in Chongqing have sparked controversy for their striking resemblance to a Beijing development by star British architect Zaha Hadid . Design theft: The director of Hadid's Beijing project (above) reportedly described the property company building a similar version in Chongqinq as 'pirates' As China rises in stature and wealth, it will increasingly seek inspiration from within, said Bosker, adding that already 'there seems to be a new confidence and interest in their own indigenous styles'. At the park with the Mount Rushmore replica, a man in his 20s surnamed Mao argued that China's neighbours mimicked its culture when it held greater sway in the past, and would do so again as the country reclaims the stage. 'If people have something good then we will copy it,' he said. 'This is something every country, every society does, not only China.' But a 27-year-old woman surnamed Huang, walking past the fake Manhattan with a friend, said her compatriots should embrace their own heritage. 'It seems like Chinese people have this view that anything foreign is good, that anything with English writing, whether or not they can read it, is good,' she said. 'China is not inferior to anyone, but nobody really cares a lot about China’s ancient past.'","The rise of so-called 'duplitecture' trend has developed alongside China's real estate boom in .

In preview clips of an interview set to air on Wednesday's episode of Dr Phil, Stiviano talks about loving her new-found fame and how she rollerblades to deal with stress. Papparazzi have been hounding Stiviano ever since tapes she recorded were released in which Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling can be heard making racist statements. Scroll down for videos . Loving the limelight: V. Stiviano talks about relishing her new-found fame and how she rollerblades to deal with stress in a taped interview set to air on Wednesday's episode of Dr Phil . Acting crazy: In preview clips of the interview, Dr Phil calls out Stiviano's strange behavior - including wearing her now-signature visor while rollerblading . The scandal led the NBA to ban 80-year-old Sterling from the league for life and turned Stiviano, 31, into an overnight celebrity. When asked by Dr Phil if she likes being in the spotlight, Stiviano responds: 'Absolutely!' 'Are you kidding me? I get to experience first-hand what it is to be a celebrity in LA,' she says. 'I have to think about what I'm going to wear, how I'm going to do my hair.'

Attention seeker: On the day Sterling was banned from the NBA for making racist statements in private conversations Stiviano recorded, his much younger girlfriend was pictured out rollerblading and wearing an unusual visor for 'privacy' On Tuesday Stiviano left her apartment and headed to pray at Our Lady Of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral in Los Angeles . Fortunately for other drivers on the road she took off her roller skates before getting behind the wheel . She even ditched her massive visor - if not her name plate hat . She has plenty of cars to choose from and today went for her subdued black Bentley . 'We all have different ways of coping, we all have different ways of dealing with issues,' a defensive Stiviano shoots back. 'Some of us drink, some of us exercise, some of us rollerblade. You live in Hollywood, you deal with Hollywood - so you tell me how should I have acted?' In a press release about the interview, a show spokesman promises that Stiviano will answer questions about the 'specific nature' of her relationship with Sterling and why she recorded their private conversations. 'Stiviano speaks to her criminal history; the many names she's gone by over the years and the reasons why; her specific job description and title, and is nearly brought to tears when Dr Phil asks her if she is in love with Donald Sterling,' the release reads. Emotional: Stiviano comes close to tears when Dr Phil asks her if she loves Donald Sterling. The couple pictured together at a Clippers game in December 2010 . When asked why she agreed to the interview, Stiviano said: 'I think you're the best. I'm here to clear the air, to tell the truth'. Dr Phil has been itching to interview Stiviano, and talked about wanting to speak with both her and Sterling in an Access Hollywood segment earlier this month. 'She's been wearing what looks like a welders' helmet - I'm not sure what that is. Maybe she's an arc welder by trade? I don't know. I'm confused about the whole thing,' he said on the show. The interview is set to air Wednesday at 3pm and comes just after the NBA formally moved to vote Sterling out of the league. When the tapes were first released, NBA commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league for life, hit him with a maximum fine of $2.5million and asked the board of governors to remove him as owner.

The Duggars first entered the spotlight in 2008 on TLC's show 17 and Counting - a series which followed the life of Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17  - now 19 - children. The family is conservative Christian and has strong beliefs about issues such as contraception, home-schooling, and spending very little time on the internet or watching TV. They are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement which 'teaches that children are God’s blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given.' Addressing their critics, Mr Duggar once said: 'People think we are overpopulating the world [but] we are following our convictions.'","Her chances of conceiving are less than five per cent and her odds of having a child with down syndrome are 'one in four or five'
This marks the longest time in 27 years that Mrs Duggar has not been pregnant .
The strictly Christian family does not believe in birth control ."
"By . Simon Tomlinson . Next time you're struggling with the school run, spare a thought for the parents in this Chinese village. After torrential rain, they have been forced to put their children in a raft through a raging river in order to get them to classes on time. Students in China would not dream of letting anything as minor as a flash-flood put them off attending school for the all-important education they need to succeed in modern China. So these pupils instead battle through the flood waters in the village of Shanzheng in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Water way to get to school: Chinese pupils are forced to take a raft across a flooded river to make it to class . Between a raft and a hard place: The pupils were pictured battling through the flood waters of the river in the village of Shanzheng in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region . After the flood, authorities bought the students life jackets to keep them safe when crossing the river, but said there is no money for the bridge parents want. Only last week, pupils were photographed wading through another overflowing river in the remote Jiumiaozhai village in the same region of China. One boy, six-year-old Shi Kang, said: 'It was cold and I was a little bit afraid but it was OK in the end. I did it because I want to go to school. I cannot afford to miss anything.' His mother Chan Lo said: 'It has rained for over a month here and the roadway to the school was washed away long ago. 'It is around 100 metres across and 22 primary school children, like my son, have to make the journey twice a day to get to classes. Tough love: After the flood, authorities bought the students life jackets to keep them safe when crossing the river, but said there is no money for the bridge parents want . 'Quite slippery, but they've got the hang of it': Pupils were also photographed wading through another overflowing river in the remote Jiumiaozhai village in the same region of China . 'If they didn't make this crossing here, they would have to walk for three miles and then still get wet. 'Here they can walk on the top of an old dam. It is quite slippery but they have got the hang of it. 'They all look out for one another and are very cautious. No-one has yet been swept away. We instil the need for safety in all of them.' Local water authority official Chang Shen said: 'There is not enough money to build a bridge yet, but we hope to in the near future. 'It is not ideal for children to have to go through this twice a day, but there is no alternative at present. Not so much a school run as a treacherous walk: Parents carry their children across a swollen river . 'At the moment, they can walk across the dam top but sometimes it gets so flooded that only a raft is operable. 'Still, from what I have heard of western children, our ones are a lot tougher and willing to put up with much more to get to classes on time.' China is included in international education tests held every three years by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, measure pupils' skills in reading, numeracy and science. These Pisa tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment - have become the leading international benchmark and show China has an education system that is overtaking most Western countries. The Pisa 2009 tests even showed that Shanghai was top of the international education rankings.","Even flash floods won't stop Chinese children making it to class on time .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ukip leader Nigel Farage embarked on a final round of media interviews ahead of local and European elections tomorrow . Nigel Farage today claimed he would ‘do a deal with the devil’ if it meant securing a referendum on Britain leaving the European Union. The Ukip leader said he would back a Labour or Conservative minority government if he gets MPs in the Commons next year to ensure the public get a say on the EU. He also revealed plans to tackle the perception that his party is like a ‘one-man band’, and conceded that the pressure of the Euro election campaign had meant ‘sometimes a few cracks begin to show’. Polls suggest Ukip will win the European Parliament elections, pushing Labour into second place and the Tories in third. Local elections are also being held in England, with 4,216 seats and 161 councils at stake. Mr Farage is increasingly confident that Ukip will win tomorrow’s European Parliament elections when results are announced on Sunday night. He wants to use a victory over Labour and the Tories as a springboard to securing seats in the Commons, claiming Ukip could even hold the balance of power in the event of a hung Parliament. Mr Farage acknowledged it was ‘moonshine’ to suggest that Ukip, which has no MPs, could win the 2015 election, but the party would target winnable seats in an effort to hold the balance of power. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I would do a deal, post the next election, I would help a minority party in Westminster, I would do a deal with the devil in those circumstances if it got us a referendum.’ He claimed that Labour leader Ed Miliband would be forced to match the Tory pledge of an in-out referendum if his party does badly in this week’s elections. David Cameron has promised a public vote on membership of the EU by the end of 2017, but Mr Farage was sceptical about the pledge. Asked if he was saying the Prime Minister was dishonourable, Mr Farage said: ‘I'll pass on that.’ Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage, pictured outside the BBC studios today, said he would do a deal with any party that secured an EU referendum . Mr Farage is planning to overhaul the Ukip operation this summer to end the perception that the party is a 'one-man band' Mr Farage has faced intense media interest in recent weeks, which he admits has meant some 'cracks' have appeared in the campaign . On a troubled election campaign: ‘We all make mistakes in life and things don’t always go according to plan. When you’re out in front and everybody’s firing every missile they’ve got at you, yeah, sometimes a few cracks begin to show. On being a one-man band: ‘I think in terms of the European election campaign, I have been very much the dominant figure in the campaign, yes, I accept that and I don’t think in terms of this election that’s necessarily been a handicap. I’m going to appoint, over the course of the summer, spokesmen who will take on responsibilities for specific areas and they’re the people that I’m going to push forward because I don’t think people will vote for us in a general election in big numbers if they think it’s a one-man band.’ On the general election: ‘What we will do is pursue, for 2015, a strategy not to win the general election – that would be entirely ridiculous, moonshine. But what we will do is to do what Paddy Ashdown did so brilliantly with the Lib Dems in the 1990s and that is to target our resources and to target our best people to get a good number of UKIP MPs elected in 2015 and who knows, we may get the balance of power if we get that right, and if we do there will be a referendum, whoever’s in government.’ One getting an in-out referendum: ‘‘I would do a deal, post the next election, I would help a minority party in Westminster, I would do a deal with the devil in those circumstances if it got us a referendum.’ On talks between Ukip and the Tories: ‘They don’t talk to people like me. There are no lines of communication open between Tory high command and UKIP. We are considered to be the lower orders’ On his epitaph: ‘I hope what it will say is: He led a party to win a national election on 22 May 2014 which led on to a referendum and our country getting back its democracy.’ He said 'one or two' Tory MPs were interested in running as joint Conservative-Ukip candidates in 2015 and he was 'open to having those conversations', but predicted they would be vetoed by Mr Cameron. Some polls put Ukip ahead in the Euro elections, while others suggest Labour are in the lead. Mr Farage insisted that Ukip had run a more professional campaign than in the past but he admitted that not everything had gone according to plan. A ‘carnival’ staged in Croydon yesterday to prove Ukip is not racist had to be abandoned after a steel band refused to play and protesters drowned out candidates’ speeches. Ukip strategists hoped it would be a 'bold and vibrant' event to defy their critics, but organisers were confronted with protesters likening the party to Nazis. Mr Farage tore up plans to attend after opponents clashed with party members, the steel band walked out and a Ukip candidate branded Croydon a 'dump'. Today Mr Farage admitted that 'we all make mistakes in life and things don't always go according to plan' and, because the party had been leading the polls ahead of tomorrow's elections, it had come under sustained pressure and 'sometimes a few cracks begin to show'. But he insisted the party's popularity would continue beyond the European elections, and promised that a 'higher calibre' of Ukip politicians would help the party act less like a 'one-man band' in future. 'There are now people who don't just lend their votes to Ukip for European elections, they are actually Ukip voters,' he said. 'What I'm going to do over the course of the summer, and remember we are going to have a whole new load of MEPs elected, they will be a much higher calibre than anything we've ever had before. 'I am going to appoint, over the course of the summer, spokesmen to take on responsibilities for specific areas and they are the people I'm going to push forward. 'I don't think people will vote for us in a general election in numbers if they think it's a one-man band. I intend to change that over the summer.' The comments will be seen as an admission that the party’s success cannot depend on his own personal appeal alone. A Ukip 'carnival' staged in Croydon yesterday to prove the party is not racist had to be abandoned after protesters clashed with party members . Nigel Farage once claimed he had different views on women to other men - because he had 'got so many pregnant'. The Ukip leader, who has four children from two marriages, told an obscure Brussels magazine that he did not think women should fight on the front line in the army. He said he might disagree with other men on this question because of his experience with women. The bizarre comments, to Belgium's 'Up Front' magazine, came after the last general election in 2010. He was asked if women should play football, but he said there was 'a bigger question' of whether they should be allowed into the army. The Ukip leader said: 'Do we think, chaps, when we're there in the front line, when the balloon goes up, with fixed bayonets, when the whistle's about to blow to go over the top, do we actually want to be there with women beside us?' A barman, working near to where the interview was taking place, shouted out: 'Yes!' Mr Farage responded: 'Do we? What an extraordinarily bizarre idea! I certainly don't think so. But maybe it's because I've got so many women pregnant over the years that I have a different view. Critics of Mr Farage’s leadership style have claimed he prefers to dominate the limelight. But the pressures of a general election campaign mean he will need a bigger team around him. Mr Farage insisted that he has had no talks with the Tories directly, adding: 'They don’t talk to people like me. There are no lines of communication open between Tory high command and UKIP. We are considered to be the lower orders.' But he hinted that local deals could be done with Eurosceptic Tory MPs which would see them run on a joint ticket with Ukip. 'I think that if there is a sitting Conservative – as I say, it could be Labour too – but if there is a sitting Conservative MP who genuinely wants this country to be independent, free, self-governing and they go along to a local UKIP association and say they want to do a deal on that basis and run on a joint ticket, we would be open to that idea.' However, Labour seized on the comments as proof that a vote for Ukip was actually a vote for the Conservatives. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher said: 'Nigel Farage has let the cat out of the bag: a vote for Ukip is a vote for the Tories. 'Ukip's policies are more Tory than the Tories. We know David Cameron cut taxes for millionaires - but Ukip want even bigger tax cuts for millionaires. We know it's harder to see your GP under David Cameron, but Ukip think the answer is to charge people to see their GP. 'Whether it's deeper cuts to public services or scrapping workers' rights, we have confirmation that Nigel Farage is actively considering shabby political deals with the Conservatives right across the country, only days after he said he'd do a deal to keep David Cameron in Number 10. 'The message is clear: vote Ukip and you don't only get policies more extreme than the Tories, you also get David Cameron.'","Ukip leader says he would be prepared to back Labour or Tories in coalition .

"By . Amanda Williams . Paul Farrand, 18, was found dead just hours after telling a health support worker that he wanted to die . The teenage son of a jailed paedophile former deputy headmaster took a fatal drug overdose after he endured a childhood of violence at the hands of his father, an inquest has heard. Paul Farrand, 18, was found dead just hours after telling a health support worker that he wanted to die. Heywood Coroner's Court heard that he teenager had attempted suicide 17 times in less than three years, after being subject to corporal punishment at the hands of his father Derek. The former deputy head at Palatine High School in Blackpool, Lancashire once physically attacked his son after he caught him rummaging through his 'special cupboard', the inquest was told. He was later arrested after complaints he had been molesting a 12 -year old daughter of family friends.  Now 61, Farrand snr is currently serving four and a half years in jail. Paul - who the inquest heard had once tried to jump out of a window when he was only 11 - was so badly affected by his childhood experiences, it was feared he might be a risk to his siblings. He was found dead at his flat five days after his 18th birthday after taking prescription pills. At an inquest his mother Michelle, 39, of Heywood, Greater Manchester said: ‘His father was very aggressive with him. He was a paedophile and he had special cupboard for him and this girl. 'Paul used to take things out of it and Derek would get very aggressive and confront Paul, pushing him or screaming at him. Paul became very upset so I started to take the blame myself.' She added: 'Paul was scared of turning 18. I think he was scared of being put into the adult world and I did not realise how upset he was. He was my little boy angel. He was a lovely lad.' Earlier the Heywood hearing was told Paul harboured ambitions to be a mountain rescue climber but was taken into specialist care at the Hope Unit at Fairfield Hospital in Bury after he was unable to complete his last year at high school. Heywood Coroner's Court heard that he teenager had attempted suicide 17 times in less than three years, after being subject to corporal punishment at the hands of his father Derek. The former deputy head at Palatine High School in Blackpool, Lancashire once physically attacked his son after he caught him rummaging through his 'special' cupboard, the inquest was told . Mrs Farrand said: 'He would have mood . swings. He sat there not wanting to do anything. He slept on the couch . because there was no room. He said he heard voices. 'One night he woke me up because he got very angry because he heard voices. 'He became very distressed through the night. I stayed with him. He would lose his temper and smash things around.' His mother was then told that her son could no longer come home as he was a risk to his siblings. She said: 'I had to choose between Paul and the children because if I choose Paul the other children would go into care. 'I think the stress of being told he could not come home was too much - he could just not cope with it. 'I think he was scared he was going to be in a unit for the rest of his life.' Paul was found dead at his flat a week later after the meeting in November last year. Jessica Daly a support worker who was duty when Paul died said she came across the teenager at 1.40am in the unit. She said: ‘He started staring, looking at me, very rigid. He was not talking to me but could recognise I was there. 'He kept repeating “I want to die.” We went down stairs in the living room for a couple of minutes. He was really aggravated, screaming “I hate god. Why has he done this to me, making me live when I feel like this?” Derek Farrand, former deputy head at Palatine High School in Blackpool, Lancashire is currently serving four and a half years in jail . He appeared to calm down and went back to bed but later that day was found dead. Records showed Paul tried to take his own life 17 times between February 2011 and November 2013. But recording a verdict of accidental death coroner Michael Salt said he could not be certain Paul wanted to kill himself that night. He said: 'He had previously taken action that affected himself and that could have ended his life. Did he fully intend the consequences of this occasion? I am not satisfied that we can say that beyond reasonable doubt.' During his trial Farrand snr was said to have been infatuated with the girl after meeting her through family friends shortly before he retired from his job at a high school in 2009. He initially bought her gifts including sweets, drinks and even a mobile phone to win her trust before subjecting to a string of attacks. Farrand also took a picture of himself abusing the girl and sexually assaulted her older sister. The attack took place after Farrand found out the girl had been subjected to a previous rape which led to her attacker being jailed. He was arrested June 2012 when a relative discovered hundreds of pornographic images on his computer including pictures of his young victim. When confronted Farrand turned himself into police. He admitted sexual assault and taking or making indecent images of a child and was given a lifetime ban from working with children and must sign the Sex Offender Register for an indefinite period.","Paul Farrand found dead hours after telling social worker he wanted to die .

"By . James Chapman . Lee Rigby's family have fought hard to stop Far Right groups co-opting his name for their causes . Speaker John Bercow is being accused of protecting a Left-wing ‘quango queen’ responsible for letting an extreme-Right party use butchered soldier Lee Rigby’s name in this week’s elections. Sources revealed that Jenny Watson, head of the Electoral Commission, offered to resign after Britain First was mistakenly allowed to use the description ‘Remember Lee Rigby’ on voting slips for Thursday’s European polls - which fall on the first anniversary of his death. The approval given to Britain First - a breakaway group of former BNP activists which describes itself as a 'patriotic resistance frontline' – to adopt the slogan has appalled MPs and Fusilier Rigby’s family. But by the time the blunder had been spotted, it was too late to amend ballot papers. Government sources revealed that Mr Bercow refused to accept Miss Watson’s resignation over the fiasco. The Commission – the country’s elections watchdog -- is answerable to Parliament via a committee headed by the Speaker. ‘Bercow has protected Jenny Watson,’ said one. ‘This is a dreadful episode and ultimately, she is in charge of the body that it responsible for it.’ Lyn Rigby, the murdered soldier’s mother, has said she is heartbroken that the group has been allowed to attempt to hijack his death for its own ends. Britain First applied to use seven slogans in the European elections and four were rejected, but the one relating to Fusilier Rigby was approved by the watchdog. After a damning report on the Electoral Commission’s handling of the affair, Miss Watson apologised and said it ‘should never have been permitted’. The commission's director of party and election finance Peter Horne’s resignation was accepted rather than hers. He ‘remembered thinking that it was distasteful but not sufficient to cause offence’, according to an independent investigation. The commission’s staff were found to have they failed to consider the need to protect public safety, morals and the rights and reputations of others. The watchdog has now agreed to introduce new rules over the descriptions political parties can use at the ballot box. Fusilier Rigby, from Greater Manchester, was murdered as he returned to his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London on May 22 2013, in a crime that horrified the nation. He died of multiple stab wounds. Two men, Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were found guilty of his barbaric murder after a trial at the Old Bailey. Adebolajo was given a whole-life term and Adebowale a minimum of 45 years in jail. Conservative MP Gary Streeter, chairman of the Speaker’s committee on the Electoral Commission, said: ‘Jenny Watson did offer her resignation. The Speaker and the Speaker’s committee agreed that the right thing to do was not to accept it. ‘We were mindful that the person directly responsible for the error did resign, and also that there are very big changes coming up in the electoral system coming up in the next few months and a referendum in Scotland. ‘It is all terribly distressing. Jenny Watson did speak to each member of the family personally but it won’t alleviate their distress.’ Commons Speaker John Bercow is said to have protected Electoral Commission boss Jenny Watson . Geraint Davies, Labour and Co-operative MP for Swansea West, said the oversight was so grave that he believed Miss Watson should have quit. ‘It is completely unacceptable for Lee Rigby’s memory to be sullied by any political party, let alone one with views as odious as the BNP splinter group Britain First,’ he said. ‘The Commission’s decision to place Fusilier Rigby’s name alongside this racist and Islamophobic party on ballot papers is simply inexcusable.’ Cabinet Office minister Greg Clark said it was sickening that anyone should attempt to make political capital out of Fusilier Rigby's murder. ‘The whole country will be outraged that the memory of Lee Rigby should be abused in this way, and our heart goes out to his family, friends and colleagues,’ he added. Miss Watson once headed the now-defunct Equal Opportunities Commission as well as working for the Left-wing campaign organisation Charter 88 and the gender equality group The Fawcett Society. She faced calls to resign from the Electoral Commission in 2010, after presiding over chaos which led to hundreds of voters being turned away from general election polling stations. Police had to deal with queues as the voting deadline passed in Sheffield, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, parts of London and Surrey. The head of the Electoral Commission insisted the situation would ‘never happen again.’ An Electoral Commission spokesman said “On April 29 the chair of the Commission, in advance of the independent investigation concluding, offered her resignation which the Speaker’s committee did not accept. At the time the Speaker’s committee had not yet received or considered the report from the independent investigator. Once it had considered the report, the committee concluded that there were no grounds for the chair of the Commission to resign.’","Britain First will use the slogan 'Remember Lee Rigby' on ballot papers .

"By . Kate Lyons . She's been dubbed Australia's Katniss Everdeen - and Christie Pisani says she would 'kick a***' at the Hunger Games. The 30-year-old paramedic, personal trainer and bow-hunter was born in Western Sydney into a 'hunting family' and estimates that she first shot a rifle at the age of four. Ms Pisani switched to bow-hunting at the age of 20 and estimates that she has killed more than 40 different species of animals, including pigs, goats, deer, and buffalo, warthog and wildebeest. Scroll down for video . Christie Pisani has killed more than 40 different species of animals with her bow, since she took up bow-hunting at the age of 20 . Ms Pisani says she would 'kick a***' at the Hunger Games, the blockbuster movie starring Jennifer Lawrence . Her first kill was a goat, which she cooked on camp oven for dinner and her most terrifying moment came when she was charged by a buffalo in the Northern Territory. The Goondiwindi local, who writes a column, Babes And Bows, for Bowhunting Downunder magazine, is a passionate advocate of hunting and thinks more women should be involved in the sport. 'I think women bring a softer edge to the sport… We're quite in touch with the idea of ethical hunting – only taking what you need, not letting things suffer more than they need to,' she said. She says that while the sport attracts criticism, most of that is down to ignorance and that hunters are often quite environmentally conscious. Ms Pisani is currently a semi-finalist in the Extreme Huntress competition, if she makes it to the top six, she will travel to Texas in July to film the finals . Ms Pisani started hunting at the age of four and says the sport is 'family-friendly' and misunderstood by critics who think it is cruel . She says that more women should get into hunting, because they bring an 'ethical' side to the sport . 'Hunters are the ones who are out there in the bush and it's in our interest to protect the bush,' she said. 'People are always opposed to what they don't understand. People forget where their meat comes from. 'Hunters generally, except for a handful of bad apples, do respect the animals and don't want to see them suffer more than is necessary.' Ms Pisani is one of 20 semi-finalists in the U.S. Extreme Huntress contest, a U.S. television hunting competition, if she makes it to the top six she will fly to Texas in July to film the television show. The show's tagline is: 'If mom goes hunting so will her children', and Ms Pisani agrees that hunting is a family-friendly sport. Ms Pisani met her husband Luke through the sport, he runs bow-hunting tours . Ms Pisani, who currently lives in Goondiwindi in Queensland, is a paramedic and a personal trainer . Ms Pisano's dream is to bag an American bison, which she hopes to do if she makes it to the finals of the Extreme Huntress competition this year . It has proved to be a romantic sport for her as well, it was through hunting that Ms Pisani met her husband Luke, who leads bow-hunting tours and she says that if the pair have children they will definitely raise them to be hunters. 'I owe a lot to my dad who provided this awesome childhood where you could just go out and go hunting whenever we wanted and he passed that passion on to us, it'd be a great thing to pass on to the next generation,' she said. In the short term though, she is hoping to make it to the Extreme Huntress finals, and bag an American bison. Christie says that success in hunting depends on persistence, patience, attention to detail and compassion for the animal . Christie has hunted in Australia and also in Namibia, where she was able to hunt wildebeest and warthog, but her most terrifying encounter was with a water buffalo in the Northern Territory .","Huntress Christie Pisani, 30, from Queensland first shot a rifle aged 4 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . They might be future rivals for the Tory leadership, but today David Cameron and Boris Johnson were at pains to show they are great mates. Hitting the campaign trail for the the Newark by-election, the Prime Minister laughed, joked and even bought a rocky road cake for the London Mayor. Unfortunately the unusual joint appearance outside London drew parallels with the bizarre Labour photo opportunity in 2005, when Tony Blair bought Gordon Brown an ice-cream months before being forced to say when he would hand over the keys to Number 10. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and Boris Johnson swapped banter about baking as they toured stalls in Newark . The sight of Mr Cameron paying for cakes for his leadership rival drew parallels with the infamous moment Tony Blair bought ice-creams for Gordon Brown before the 2005 general election . Mr Blair's moment of generosity was supposed to end speculation about tensions between the two Labour figures, but he came under intense pressure to name a date for handing over power to Mr Brown . Mr Johnson and Mr Cameron spent several hours together, sharing a joke over a coffee at Newark train station . Travelling back into London on the tube, the Prime Minister caught up on the news while Mr Johnson chatted with aides . The Tory duo toured a market, pressing the flesh and posing for photographs with babies. As they traded jokes at a bakery stall, Mr Cameron bought the London Mayor a slice of cake, telling him 'that's a gift. Rocky Road... you know you want it'. The pair spent about 30 minutes chatting with the public in the sunshine, posing for selfies and, in the case of Mr Johnson, handing out leaflets. They were trying to drum up support for Tory candidate Robert Jenrick in the by-election triggered by the resignation of disgraced MP Patrick Mercer. Ukip leader Nigel Farage ruled out standing in the seat himself, but MEP Roger Helmer was selected instead. Mr Cameron bought Mr Johnson a £1 piece of Rocky Road from Les Flowerdew's bakery stall, which the mayor munched on as he teased the Prime Minister about his cooking skills. 'The Prime Minister bakes his own bread,' Mr Johnson said. Mr Cameron insisted on buying the crunchy treat, saying: 'Boris, that's a gift. Rocky Road. You know you want it.' Mr Johnson said: 'Why don't you share some of your baking secrets.'  Apparently both men agreed the Rocky Road was excellent. During the 2005 general election campaign, with tensions between Mr Blair and Mr Brown mounting, spin doctors contrived for them to go on a walkabout in Gillingham, Kent to prove that they were actually getting on famously. But days after securing Labour's historic third election victory, Mr Blair faced calls to quit early into his third term and was forced from office in 2007. Mr Cameron indulged in the political tradition of posing with babies while on the campaign trail . Securing victory in Newark will be key to the Tory plan to prove it can see off the threat from Ukip . During a walkabout, Mr Cameron was confronted about government policy on the NHS, crime and schools . Mr Cameron insisted that the government was putting more money into key public services . But as Mr Cameron munched on his own piece of chocolate and marshmallow he was forced to defend the 20 per cent VAT rate by a more serious-minded member of the public who pressed him on whether it would be scrapped if he won the General Election. 'I cannot make that promise,' the Prime Minister said. Earlier the duo were confronted about the state of local NHS services when he campaigned with London mayor Boris Johnson in a market ahead of the Newark by-election. Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson mingled with shoppers and market traders in the centre of the Nottinghamshire town where the by-election is due on June 5. Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson are expected to be seen together a lot more in the run-up to the 2015 general election . The PM has described the London Mayor as one of his 'star players' who he wants to see on the national pitch . Local resident Brian Boby asked the Prime Minister: 'What have you done towards helping the hospital and everything closing in Newark?' Mr Cameron said: 'What we're doing is that we're keeping the hospital in Newark. There's a lot more we can do, particularly with the ambulance service, because I know the ambulance service hasn't been good enough in recent years.' But Mr Boby said: 'You're running the hospital down, you're running the ambulance service down, we've got a police station with no policemen - this is only time we've seen any policemen, today. You've done nothing for Newark.' The Prime Minister said: 'We are making sure that the hospital continues in Newark. We're putting money into the health service. 'We've got more doctors and more nurses here in the East Midlands than when I became Prime Minister. 'But I know we want to do more on the ambulance service particularly, and that's one of the things Robert (Jenrick, the Tory candidate) and I have been talking about today.'","PM persuades his 'star player' to join him in campaigning outside London .

Jonathan Sutton, 39, who has been having surgery on knife wounds sustained during the incident in which his partner, Emma Mansell died, served with the West Yorkshire Police a decade ago. Mother of three Miss Mansell, 37, was pronounced dead in hospital shortly after police were called to her house in Huddersfield over reports of a domestic incident.

Injury: Police rushed Miss Mansell from her home to hospital but she was pronounced dead a short while later . Miss Mansell, who worked at a special school in Huddersfield for a decade, had two sons, Freddie, 11, and Oscar, nine, with her estranged husband, Stuart Siswick.  She also had a six-month-old daughter, Elise, with Mr Sutton, while her partner has a six-year-old son. All of the children were treated for injuries after the incident, with the two older boys needing surgery for their wounds. Neighbours said Freddie and Oscar ran screaming from the house, covered in blood, with wounds to their hands, arms, and bodies.  One said Freddie was shaking, while his younger brother cried: 'I've been stabbed, help me.  Someone needs to save my mummy, brothers and baby sister.' A neighbour who went to help the older boy said: 'He just kept saying, ‘I think he has killed my mum and my baby sister’. 'I said who has done this and he told me. He was very, very distressed. 'I just did what I could to help. I laid him down because he was bleeding heavily.  I tried to keep him calm'. The children are now believed to have been released from hospital, into the care of Miss Mansell's former husband, Mr Siswick. Footage provided courtesy of Radio Aire News .

A window has what appears to be a bloody handprint at the house Miss Mansell, right, shared with Mr Sutton . Scene: Officers launched a murder probe after they were called to the house in Huddersfield on Sunday . Detectives are waiting to question Mr Sutton, who needed surgery for knife wounds to the throat and neck. He . has not been arrested due to his medical condition but police say he . has been 'detained' in hospital and that they are not looking for anyone . else in connection with the incident. He served with West Yorkshire Police from May 2003 until he resigned in November 2004. Miss Mansell, who reverted to her maiden name after splitting from Mr Siswick, worked at Longley special school in Huddersfield. Head teacher Anne Lawton said: 'Emma worked here for 10 years as a teaching assistant.  She was a popular and well respected member of the school community. 'She will be sorely missed by everybody. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.' Neighbours in the residential . street said that Miss Mansell had separated from her husband around 18 months . ago before beginning a new relationship with Mr Sutton, whom they . described as a labourer she had met in a local pub. Probe: A forensics officer photographs the garden of the house where Miss Mansell was found badly injured . Since the fatal incident on Sunday night, forensics officers have been combing the property for evidence . Forensic markers: Officers will speak to Mr Sutton when he is sufficiently recovered from his knife injuries . Neighbours said they found Miss Mansell's two sons bloodied and injured on the street on Sunday night . Marcel Adams, one of Miss Mansell's childhood friends, said: 'I can't believe this has happened to Emma. 'She . was always so lovely and kind. She's had a lot of things happen to her . in her life. She lost a child to meningitis years ago and she has always . just tried to get on with things.' She added: 'Apparently . Emma was madly in love with her partner but I never knew him. I saw her . a few months ago and she was crying so I asked what was wrong. She . didn't want to tell me but I told her she knew where I was if she wanted . to talk.' Friends, neighbours, relatives and colleagues laid flowers on the wall of the house including one from her Miss Mansell's nieces. Horror: Neighbours said they had seen a baby being brought out of the house, its blanket covered in blood . Investigation: Neighbours said Miss Mansell had lost her first child, Charlie, to meningitis at the age of two . One message read: 'Aunty Emma, Sleep tight, we love you so much, your now with Charlie watching over us. I can never say bye just see you because I will see you again. Love you.' Charlie was Miss Mansell's first child, who died at the age of two in 2001 from meningitis. June Fuery, 52, choked back tears and was shaking as she laid flowers at Emma’s home. She said: 'I worked with Emma behind the bar at Oakes Club. I knew her before that as I knew her mum and dad. 'We had some right laughs at the club. She was a lovely lady, bubbly and outgoing. She loved her children, and was heartbroken when Charlie died from meningitis.' She added: 'My neighbour’s friend went out into the street and saw her eldest Freddie covered in blood.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The stress of the weekly shop can be the cause of a headache for most people. But for Ed Miliband the contents of his shopping basket - and its cost - has become more than a question of simply what he buys and strikes at the heart of his ability to put himself on the side of cash-strapped families. First he flounded when put on the spot about how much he spends on a weekly shop. Now his claim to have a frugal grocery bill of as little as £70 has suffered a fresh blow, after it emerged he regularly spends £2.25 on an artisan loaf of bread and has his ‘assertive’ hair styled by a celebrity crimper. Scroll down for video . Mr Miliband, who also bought a bunch of red roses from New Covent Garden Market, has faced questions - and some ridicule - about his own spending habits . Celebrity hairdresser Charlotte Cave has revealed how she tried to give Mr Miliband a more 'assertive' haircut, as it emerged he regularly spends £2.25 on a loaf of bread, £2 on coffee and £1 on a croissant from his local deli . Mr Miliband is today visiting 10 areas of England to highlight 10 pledges included in Labour’s ‘cost of living contract’. He will declare: ‘Vote Labour to make your family better off.’ The tour started early this morning with a stop at New Covent Garden Market, where he enjoyed a modest bacon sandwich and bought a large bunch of red roses. But his attempt to appear to understand the difficulties cash-strapped voters face has been undermined by revelations about the contents of his shopping basket. Neighbours claim to often see him popping into the Truffles delicatessen in Dartmouth Park. He regularly buys himself a £2 cappuccino, a £2.25 loaf of bread and occasional treats himself to a £1 croissant, according to The Times. Mr Miliband, who lives nearby with wife Justine and sons Sam and Daniel, is also a regular customer at Continental Provision Stores where he runs up a bill of around £15 on organic milk, fruit and vegetables. Little wonder, then, that he seemed unsure what to say when grilled on the breakfast TV sofa about his own spending habits. Appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Mr Miliband claimed the ‘cost-of-living crisis is the biggest issue that our country faces and I am determined we tackle it’. Asked about the average weekly household grocery bill, Mr Miliband responded: ‘It depends on how much you are spending.’ Pressed on his own family's bill, Mr Miliband said: ‘We probably spend £70, £80 a week on groceries at least, probably more than that. ‘The point is that different families will have different costs that they face but what I am clear about is that there is a crisis facing so many people.’ But TV presenter Susannah Reid took him to task for appearing out of touch. She told him: ‘The average weekly bill for a family of four is more than £100. So you are going to be spending significantly more than £70 or £80. ‘People will say one of the problems with politicians is they are actually talking about something but not in touch with reality.’ Official figures for 2012 show that a family of four spent on average £113.12 every week, rising to £165.48 when eating out was included. Mr Miliband is said to be a regular at Truffles delicatessen in smart Dartmouth Park in North London . Mr Miliband often pops to Truffles delicatessen, near to where he lives in North London with wife Justine and sons Daniel (right) and Sam (left), to buy a loaf of bread costing £2.25 . Hairdresser Charlotte Cave, who has styled Lady Gaga, has revealed how she tried to give Ed Miliband a more 'assertive' haircut . All politicians want like a sprinkling of celebrity stardust. Now it is emerged that Ed Miliband has had his hair cut by a celebrity crimper who has styled the likes of Lady Gaga, U2’s Bono and Coldplay’s Chris Martin. Hairdresser Charlotte Cave has revealed how she gave the Labour leader a more ‘assertive’ style. ‘It's really nice: quite soft and very thick. I've run my hands through lots of politicians' hair, but his took me by surprise,’ she told The Times. Miss Cave runs a salon in Clapham but is often called upon to style the stars. She first tackled the Miliband barnet in 2010, when asked to prepare him for an appearance on Question Time. ‘I moved his parting so it sat flatter and made his hair much more assertive, but I don't think he liked it very much. ‘I don't know if he felt it was too much like his brother's, but it's since gone a little bit floppy-haired toff. I think we had something very assertive there, but I think what he wants varies depending on how insecure he is.’ Mr Miliband is such a fan of his local Indian restaurant that the menu declares it to be his favourite. He has previously said his favourite meal is a Chinese - duck, spring rolls, sweet and sour chicken. Mr Miliband also appeared uncomfortable when discussing his own circumstances. He earns £139,000 as leader of the opposition, and his wife Justine is reported to earn £200,000-a-year as a lawyer. Their home is said to be worth more £2million. Mr Miliband conceded: ‘I am relatively comfortably off, but what I know is that there are deep issues that need to be tackled.’ The Labour leader suffered further humiliation in a subsequent radio interview because he did not know the name of the Labour party leader at a battleground council. His blunders were seized on by the Tories, who accused him of being a ‘champagne socialist’. The interviews made for a day of woe . for Mr Miliband as voters prepare to go to the polls tomorrow for . European and local council elections. He has been under pressure after two polls last week put the Tories ahead for the first time in two years. He hopes to draw a line under interest in his own spending with a new focus on Labour policies ahead of local and European Parliament elections tomorrow. He is embarking on a 10 visits - taking him from London to his Doncaster constituency via towns in the South East, East of England, East Midlands and Yorkshire & Humberside. The Labour leader added: 'If I have heard one message most of all in this campaign, it is the depths of discontent about the way the country is run. 'The challenges go beyond this Government. And people are asking whether any political party can turn it round? 'Can anyone rebuild the link between a hard day's work and ordinary family finances? 'That link that used to be the foundation of our country's prosperity. That used to guarantee the people of this country a decent life for them and their families. 'My answer is that Labour can and Labour will. People should vote Labour on Thursday to make Britain better than this. Vote Labour to make your family better off.' Labour has attempted to show that despite the economic recovery, ordinary people are not feeling better off. Following the ITV interview yesterday morning, Mr Miliband attempted to correct his blunder, saying . his overall shopping bill would  be ‘slightly higher’ than he . suggested. The correction backfired because he implied that the  £70 or . £80 was for ‘basic fruit and vegetables’. Speaking . on BBC Radio Oxford, he said: ‘Well, I said this morning  it was on the . basic groceries, the basic fruit and vegetables, about £70 or £80 – the . total shopping  bill was slightly higher than that, obviously.’ Mr Miliband was tackled about his finances during a difficult interview on ITV's Good Morning Britain . Mr . Miliband’s day then got worse during an interview on BBC Radio . Wiltshire in which he was shown to lack knowledge of local politicians. Ben Prater, the interviewer, asked him what he made of ‘Jim Grant’ without saying who he was. Mr . Miliband asked him to repeat the question but then admitted he had no . idea who he was talking about, and asked the presenter to ‘enlighten’ him. In a toe-curling exchange, Mr Prater told him Mr Grant was the Labour leader on Swindon council.  Mr . Miliband then blundered again by referring to Mr Grant as the leader of . Swindon council, when in fact the council is controlled by . Conservatives. Flailing, Mr Miliband said: ‘I think he is doing a good job for Labour on the council.’ Tory . MP Julian Smith said: ‘Ed Miliband has sealed his credentials as an out . of touch champagne socialist who has no idea how hard-working people . live. 'The Labour . leader is the man without a plan, stumbling from opportunist gimmick to . gimmick, with policies unravelling by  the day. Even his own MPs don’t . trust him.’","Labour leader visits Truffles delicatessen in Dartmouth Park, north London .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A grieving father who shot himself twice at the graveside of his dead son has died of his injuries. Allen Hinchliffe, 52, turned the shotgun on himself three weeks ago while visiting the grave of 20-year-old son Ben, who died in a car crash last year. Mr Hinchliffe, of Scholes in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, shot and killed Ben’s beloved Springer Spaniel before blasting himself under the armpit and in the stomach. Best man: Allen Hinchliffe and his wife Pamela (both seated) on their wedding day. His son Ben (far right) was his father's best man. Also pictured is maid of honour Debra Brownsword (left) He suffered internal injuries and kidney . damage and was in the critical care unit at the Northern General . Hospital in Sheffield for two weeks. Mr Hinchliffe had regained consciousness and was recovering, with his family saying he was looking forward to going home. However, his condition suddenly deteriorated and he died on Monday night with wife of nine months Pamela by his side. Mother-of-three . Mrs Hinchliffe, 44, said her husband had not come to terms with the . loss of Ben, who was killed when his Suzuki 4x4 smashed into a wall in . New Mill last October. Grief: Allen Hinchliffe, pictured with wife Pamela, has died in hospital three weeks after he shot himself while visiting the grave of his son Ben . Mr Hinchliffe had visited Ben’s grave in Hade Edge Cemetery just days after an inquest heard his son may have fallen asleep at the wheel. Mrs Hinchliffe said that although Ben didn’t live with his father they saw each other virtually every day. 'They . were inseparable,' she said. 'They would do everything together and . would go out fishing and hunting with the dog they shared, Jake. 'Allen loved his son dearly and never got over the loss of Ben. 'He went up to Ben’s grave with Ben’s shotgun and shot the dog before turning the gun on himself. 'Allen loved his son dearly and never got over the loss of Ben. No one should have to bury a child' Pamela Hinchliffe . 'No-one should have to bury a child. He just wanted all three of them to be together.' Mrs . Hinchliffe said she had met her husband, a former roofer and keen . cricketer, at the Shoulder of Mutton pub in Holmfirth where she worked. 'We had both been married before and weren’t looking to get married again but we just clicked,' she said. 'He proposed and we married a year after meeting. He was a wonderful man and we loved each other to bits.' The couple married at the Durker Roods Hotel in Meltham last August and Ben was best man. Mrs Hinchliffe, who has three children of her own - Stephen, 16, Sophie, 14, and Shannon, 11, said her husband suffered internal injuries and needed surgery to remove part of his bowel and intestines. He also needed dialysis and had a catheter because of kidney damage. She said: 'He was in a coma and the first time he opened his eyes I cried.

Emergency: Police seal off the cemetery after Mr Hinchliffe shot himself at his son's grave . 'When he realised he had survived he just wanted to escape the hospital and come home with me. 'He was getting better and was moved on to a ward but then suffered a relapse and had a bleed. 'He had got over that but then went to the renal unit for dialysis and his condition deteriorated. 'I was with him at the end and Shannon, who Allen hoped to adopt, wanted to see him. 'He told me he loved me and knew he was dying.' Loss: The roadside in New Mill where Ben Hinchliffe's Suzuki 4x4 crashed last October . Mr Hinchliffe, a fast bowler who was hoping to play for Holmfirth this season, also had another son and two daughters from a previous relationship. Mrs Hinchliffe said she had questions over her husband’s death and had asked for a post-mortem examination. She also said she was waiting to hear whether an inquest would be held. The inquest into the death of trainee butcher Ben, who lived in Meltham, heard how he was not wearing a seat-belt when his 4x4 left the road. Coroner Mary Burke stressed the importance of wearing seat-belts during the hearing in April.","Allen Hinchliffe, 52, shot himself twice following the inquest of his son Ben .

"By . Richard Spillett . Criticism: Bristol councillor Gus Hoyt has been criticised for describing his £32,000 public salary as 'low pay' on Twitter . A local councillor has been slammed after he complained about the 'low pay' he gets for his public duties - despite earning £32,000 a year as an assistant mayor. Bristol council cabinet member Gus Hoyt, 38, made the controversial remarks in a Twitter conversation with a friend about a trip to New York. Green Party member Cllr Hoyt, who gave up work after he was elected, told the friend: 'Can't afford NYC I'm afraid mate. Am in a Big job but low pay...local government....' His online remarks have since been blasted by political opponents, who branded him out of touch with ordinary people. The council's Lib Dem deputy leader Chris Martin asked him: 'Your combined income is public record and is £32k - the question is how do you consider that low pay?' And Labour candidate Naomi Rylatt added: 'I'm appalled that Councillor Hoyt is ignorant enough to think £32,000 is low pay.' The £32,000 Cllr Hoyt gets in allowances for his council work are £5,300 more than the average British worker's annual wage. Mr Hoyt, who is responsible for neighbourhoods, environment and council housing, later attempted to defend himself against online critics by writing: 'It's quite interesting how some people are only driven by negativity and hatred. Must be horrible.' University-educated Hoyt receives a basic allowance of £11,530, which is paid to all councillors, on top of which he gets an extra £20,266 for being an assistant mayor. He is not contracted to work a specific number of hours but said that he regards being a councillor and an assistant mayor as two full-time jobs. Cllr Hoyt made the controversial comments whilst discussing a trip to New York with a friend online . Cllr Hoyt quit his job after being elected and now receives a basic allowance of £11,530 as well as an extra £20,266 for being an assistant mayor . The former labourer has since insisted that for most of his working life he has been on minimum wage and understood what it meant to exist on a low wage. He said: 'My comments were said in the context of my friend living in New York and earning much more than me. 'I simply could not afford to go for a week's holiday.' But he has continued to attract disapproving tweets from locals, with one Twitter user, Bristolgirl67, writing: 'If 32k is low pay I'd like to be low paid...I currently earn a quarter approx of that.' Mr Hoyt said he couldn't afford a trip to the Big Apple because he has a 'Big job but low pay...local government..' Cllr Hoyt has also been criticised for buying an ex-council house in the Montpelier area of Bristol (pictured) despite his party's opposition to selling off public housing . The criticism comes after it was revealed Cllr Hoyt bought an ex-council house for £186,000 in an auction in 2012 - despite it being Green Party policy not to sell off authority homes. Reacting to criticism over the purchase of the ex-council house, he said he entered into a blind auction for the property and did not know it was owned by the council until he had received official documents. First elected to serve Bristol's Ashley ward in 2011, Mr Hoyt will have to contest his seat again next year. The national average wage for a full-time worker is £26,500, and the annual salary for someone in a full time job on the national minimum wage is £13,124.","Council environment chief sparks anger by moaning about his pay online .

Just hours after the discovery she had buried the animal in her garden, and said a fond farwell to her companion of seven years.

But, bizarrely, she then heard Billy purring nearby, and was stunned to realise that he had been safe and well all along. Ms Marino said: 'I thought he had been resurrected and then I thought ""Oh no, I have buried the wrong cat""'. 'I gave it such a lovely burial so in a way whoever’s cat it was, at least they know it was lovingly buried'. She continued: 'A woman knocked at the front gates saying a cat had been hit right outside my door. It wasn’t her that hit it but she wanted to let me know. 'There’s not many cats by us and I have never seen another tabby cat around here. It looked exactly like mine - it was the same size and everything. I was pretty shocked as he never goes near the road.' Ms Marino is now appealing to find the owner of the cat, so they can be told what happened to their pet. She said: 'We put him in a blanket. It wasn’t until about an hour later that I heard my cat meow. He was walking from the very place I had just buried him. 'I gave it such a lovely burial so in a way whoever’s cat it was, at least they know it was lovingly buried'.

"By . Richard Spillett . A shamed deputy headmaster is still being paid his £65,000-a-year salary - four months after he admitted secretly filming children in his school's toilets. Gareth Williams, 47, was jailed for five years this week after admitting setting up a series of tiny spy cameras in clocks, fans and toilet cisterns of his school to capture images of semi-naked children. But it emerged today that he is still being paid by education authorities and has pocketed £16,000 since January, when he pleading guilty to 31 offences, including voyeurism at his school and making and possessing more than 15,000 indecent images of children. Gareth Williams was jailed for five years for filming children in the toilets and showers of his school with secret spy cameras - but he is still being paid by education authorities, months after he pleaded guilty . Cardiff Crown Court heard that Gareth Williams installed secret cameras in the school toilet on sports day to catch as many children as possible . Cardiff Crown Court heard that Williams was appointed deputy headmaster at Glantaf High School in 2008, one year before the first indecent images were recorded . Education chiefs have admitted that - despite now sitting in his jail cell - Williams will continue to be paid . thousands every month until a formal disciplinary procedure is . completed, which could take months longer. A . furious parent of a boy secretly filmed by Williams said: 'I am . absolutely horrified that this man has continued to be paid thousands of . pounds after what he did. 'It's a disgrace and the council should be ashamed of themselves.' Cardiff Council claimed they couldn't begin disciplinary action against Williams until he had been sentenced. The court heard that Williams had 16,419 indecent images of children and 691 videos at his home in Cardiff . A . spokeswoman said: 'The sentencing concluded the criminal case against . Mr Williams. Cardiff Council and the governing body are now able to take . the appropriate action without delay.' But . even the Welsh Government has condemned the local authority's stance and . said Williams should have been banned from teaching and stripped of his salary as soon as he pleaded guilty . in January. A spokeswoman . for Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis said: 'The actions of Gareth . Williams were truly horrifying, and it is simply wrong that he should . have been paid following his guilty plea.' Williams, . from Cardiff, was deputy head of Glantaf Welsh-language high school in . the city, where former pupils include Hornblower actor Ioan Gruffudd and . former Blue Peter presenter Gethin Jones. Cardiff Crown Court heard a total of 31 boys at the 1,300-strong school aged between 11 and 16 were caught on his cameras and he had 16,419 indecent images of children and 691 videos. The court heard some of the images dated back to 2009 – a year after he was appointed deputy head at the school. During the court hearings, prosecutor . Michael Jones said of the images relating to the voyeurism charges: . ‘All these images were of children exposed as they were using the . lavatory or the showers. ‘They . had also been uploaded to a computer and catalogued by their age at the . time the children were filmed. Officers discovered images of young . males and the school’s badge could be seen. ‘They had been filmed in the changing facilities in the school sports hall.’ Williams, . who concealed one camera as a meter on the water cistern, even filmed . himself on some of the videos as he secretly installed his devices. A judge sentenced Williams to five years at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured), describing his actions as 'depraved' Mr . Jones explained: ‘On one of the videos he is seen crossing his fingers . as he put it up.

At his sentencing hearing, Judge Rhys Rowlands told Williams: ‘This is a dreadful and protracted breach of trust on  your behalf. ‘As . a result of your depraved behaviour you have lost your career, . livelihood and reputation.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A suspected thief is being hunted by police after abandoning his phone - complete with selfie screensaver - at the scene of a jewellery shop raid. Germain Ibrahim Fofana, 27, allegedly stole three rings worth £18,000 from a shop in Kingston, Southwest London, after posing as a loving couple with a female accomplice, police believe. But his scheme fell apart when officers identified him using the background picture from the phone. Damning: This phone, containing a picture of Germain Ibrahim Fofana, 27, was left at the scene of the crime . Fofana, who is also wanted for burglary, robbery and shop-lifting, came into the shop just before 2pm on Sunday with the woman and a child in a buggy. They posed as customers who wanted to buy engagement rings, and picked out two they were interested in. They then left the store, saying they wanted to look elsewhere. Fofana later returned by himself, and asked the same shop assistant whether he could see the rings again - as well as a wedding ring. After tricking the assistant into handing all three rings over, Fofana ran out of the shop - but left his phone behind, containing the damning photograph. Detective Sergeant Damion Cummings from Kingston CID, said: 'In his hurry to run out of the shop, the suspect left his mobile phone on the table alongside his bag. 'While police were on scene the phone lit up having received a text message and a picture of the suspect was saved as the background. It was then the shop assistant who served him was able to identify the person in the picture. Ploy: The jewellery raid took place at Ernest Jones in Kingston, Southwest London . 'Having conducted further enquiries the suspect has been identified as Germain Ibrahim Fofana, a 27-year-old French national. 'We also know he is wanted for further offences including shop-lifting, robbery and burglary across some other London boroughs.' Police are appealing for information about Fofana and his accomplice. They described him as being around 5ft 7ins, and said he speaks with a French accent. He was last seen wearing a light blue shirt, grey suit trousers and boating shoes. Officers said the woman is of large build, has long black hair and was dressed all in black.

"By . Mark Duell . A 74-year-old man has been charged with assault and child cruelty as part of an investigation into historic child abuse in the care system in North Wales. Peter Steen, from the Wrexham area, is charged with three offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and four charges of child cruelty, the National Crime Agency said. The offences are alleged to have taken place against four boys and one girl - aged between 13 and 16 - from 1978 to 1986. He has been bailed to appear at Mold Magistrates’ Court on June 12. Appearance: Peter Steen has been bailed to appear at Mold Magistrates' Court (pictured) on June 12 . Steen is the third person charged under Operation Pallial, which is looking at offences allegedly committed against people aged between six and 19 from 1953 to 1995 at care homes in North Wales. Earlier this week MailOnline reported how Richard Dafydd Vevar, 62, from Wrexham, had been charged with two offences of indecent assault against a boy aged between 13 and 16. Another man, John Allen, 72, has been charged with a string of child sex offences and awaits trial later this year. Latest figures show 37 people have been investigated as suspects under Pallial, with 20 arrests made. A total of 255 people have reported allegations to the NCA, and information from 212 is under active investigation. Some 28 care homes in North Wales are involved in the investigation. At the time the investigation was announced, Detective Superintendent Ian Mulcahey, from Merseyside Police, senior investigating officer for the inquiry, said: 'Operation Pallial is investigating new allegations of historic child abuse, some from victims previously known about and some from victims who have come forward for the first time. 'All victims of abuse have a right to expect all allegations of abuse, no matter how much time has passed, to be investigated professionally and appropriately. We will do so. 'Equally importantly, if offenders are still alive, they must be identified, investigated and brought to justice, with those who still have access to children being prioritised.'

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Seventeen million cars are expected to take to the roads over the bank holiday weekend - despite the threat of rain. The AA and traffic information company Trafficmaster have warned that Monday will be the busiest traffic of the year so far as it coincides with the start of the half term. A busier-than-usual evening rush-hour on Friday and more jams on Saturday are also being predicted as thousands set off on holiday over the extended weekend. Travel warning: 17 million cars are expected on the roads this weekend - with the M25 a hot spot . And the travel misery won’t just be on the roads. Those travelling by rail have been warned to expected delays as they contend with engineering work in places, including amendments to West Coast services due to engineering work between London and Rugby in the West Midlands. On the roads, a series of sporting events, air shows and music festivals are likely to add to congestion, with the M25, M1, M3, M5, M6, M27, A303, A30 and A38 expected to be particularly busy. Breakdown experts are warning drivers that the packed roads could spell misery for 51,000 motorists. Green Flag revealed there will be 10,300 flat batteries and one puncture every minute across the country, and 13 drivers every hour will manage to lock their keys in their car. One driver every 15 minutes put the wrong fuel in the tank. Rush hour: Friday evening and Saturday morning are expected to be busy as holidaymakers set off . AA patrolman of the year Mark Spowage said: ‘Whatever the weather, drivers should be prepared for extra traffic and possible delays on major routes to coastal areas and holiday resorts. ‘Planning your journey and avoiding the main bottlenecks could relieve the frustration of sitting in a traffic jam. ‘The roads are likely to be extremely busy and it could take a lot longer to get to your destination than you expect.’ Trafficmaster are warning drivers to check routes online before travel. Traffic experts also say that sporting events are likely to add to the travel chaos, with the horse racing at the Goodwood Festival, cricket at the Oval, Golf at Wentworth and Rugby Union Heineken cup at Cardiff all causing congestion. Popular destinations: Staycationers are expected to flock to places such as Brighton - despite the wet forecast . Mr Spowage added: ‘As the bank holiday coincides with the start of half term; many people will have taken the whole week off and be looking to get away for a break to get their summer off to a great start. ‘Preparing for your journey is important, especially if your car hasn't undertaken a long trip for a while. ‘Just take ten minutes extra to check the basics - oil and water levels, tyre pressures - check your handbook to see whether you need to increase pressures if you have a heavy load - and top up the windscreen washer.’","Bank holiday Monday expected to be busiest traffic day of the year .

"By . Mark Duell . Two more inmates have gone on the run after fleeing an open prison, police revealed today. Anthony Peloe, 43, who was serving an indeterminate sentence for possessing firearms with intent to cause harm, and convicted robber John Arnold, 30, absconded from Thorn Cross open prison. Prison officials at the jail in Warrington, Cheshire, discovered the pair were missing at about 10.30am yesterday and alerted Cheshire Police who launched a manhunt for the inmates. On the run: Anthony Peloe (left), 43, and John Arnold (right), 30, both absconded from jail yesterday morning . Officers are advising the public not to approach either prisoner, but are appealing to anybody who may have seen the two men or have information about their whereabouts to contact police urgently. Superintendent Martin Cleworth said: ‘Cheshire Police are making every effort to locate these two men including liaising with colleagues in other forces. They may be travelling together or separately. ‘My advice to any member of the public who sees them is not to approach them, but to immediately ring police on 999. ‘I would also ask members of the public to be mindful that the men remain outstanding, and despite the hot weather, be cautious about leaving your house or car insecure with an open window. ‘If you have any concerns at all, contact your local police station.’ Arnold was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence carrying a minimum term of two years after being convicted of robbery in May 2006. He is described as white, around 5ft 11ins tall and slim.

The pair are the latest in a string of inmates who have absconded from prisons in recent weeks. The . Mail reported earlier today how prisoners with a history of escaping . will no longer be placed in open prisons, after a violent convict dubbed . the Scarborough Slasher went on the run from a minimum security jail. The . Government ordered immediate changes after knife robber Damien Burns, . 39, and convicted thief Dean Jackson, 27, fled from a Category D prison . in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Other escapees: Damien Burns, 39, (left) originally from . Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and Dean Jackson (right), 27, from . Newcastle-upon-Tyne, failed to return to the open prison HMP & YOI . Hatfield in Doncaster . Police . warned the public not to approach either of the men. They walked out on . Monday night – just a fortnight after Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley . fled from an open prison in Kent, before being caught four days later. It . is the latest in a series of escapes that has heaped embarrassment on . ministers and prompted critics to brand the prison service ‘beyond a . joke’. Burns, originally from . Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and Jackson, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, . failed to return to the open prison HMP & YOI Hatfield in Doncaster on Monday evening. Officers believe . they may be attempting to make their way back to the areas they . originate from as they do not have any known connections in the South . Yorkshire region. Burns was . serving an indeterminate sentence, since 2007, for a knifepoint robbery . and Jackson was on remand awaiting a sentence for a theft related . matter. Their escape came . just a day after a murderer who absconded from an open prison was . arrested after going on the run for the fourth time. Arnold Pickering, 44, who stabbed a blind man to death, was held for being unlawfully at large at an address in Oldham. The killer was recaptured by Greater Manchester Police after failing to return to jail on Saturday afternoon.

Thomas . Moffett, a violent thief and fellow inmate with Nazi tattoos who was . also on temporary licence, also absconded on the same day from the same . prison. Moffett was arrested and is also being held in custody. Their . escape comes a fortnight after Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley . absconded from an open prison and allegedly robbed a building society . before being caught four days later. MPs have attacked the 'absolute scandal' of murderers being allowed out of prison 'willy nilly'. In . 1991, a judge said Pickering appointed himself as an ‘executioner’ when . he decided to kill 53-year-old Thomas Leigh, who was wrongly thought to . be a paedophile. Recent cases: Murderer Arnold Pickering (left), who stabbed a blind man to death, was arrested earlier this week after going on the run from jail. Another inmate, swastika-tattooed Thomas Moffett (right), 51, also failed to return from day release on Saturday but was arrested for being unlawfully at large . He was serving 18 years for that murder when he went missing on Saturday. His three previous escapes have been from Strangeways in Manchester and open prisons in Lancashire and Sussex. Pickering . and Moffett, 51, had been allowed out from HMP Kennet – an open . category C prison in Maghull, Merseyside – at 9.30am on Saturday. They . failed to return as agreed at 4.30pm. Moffett, . who has swastika tattoos on his arms, was jailed for seven years in . 2006 for a two-month spree of ‘professionally executed robberies’. He . threatened shop workers with a nail gun in a series of raids on . off-licences in Blackburn. He was caught after an employee slipped an . explosive dye pack into a bundle of cash. Armed robber Michael Wheatley, AKA the Skull Cracker, went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison . An urgent review is currently taking place into why Wheatley was allowed temporary day release earlier this month. The day release programme is . designed to help prisoners settle back into ordinary life towards the . end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training. But it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed, dangeours criminals. The . Government has admitted that more than 1,600 murderers, druglords and . other hardened criminals were granted day release last year. Last . July, Ian McLoughlin (pictured) was convicted of murdering Graham . Buck in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, while on day . release. Murderer Joseph Williams carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers after being handed a release pass in 2010. And Mark Neville, a drug dealer, spent his day out of prison in 2008 overseeing a £14million cocaine deal. Last week it was revealed more than 400 killers were kept in open prisons, which have minimal supervision. Despite . going on the run twice beforehand, the robber was allowed to walk out . of Standford Hill open prison in Kent where he was serving 13 life . sentences. He was eventually . caught in East London on May 7 after spending almost four days on the . run and has since been charged with robbing the Chelsea Building . Society, in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, at gunpoint. Last . year, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick said HMP Kennet had . ‘needlessly restrictive’ security for an open prison. Located near . Liverpool, the prison is home to almost 350 men and is located next to . Ashworth high security hospital,  which houses Moors murderer Ian Brady. Justice . Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'Keeping the public safe is our priority . and I will not allow the actions of a small minority of offenders . [to] undermine public confidence in the prison system . 'Absconds . have reached record lows under this Government but I take each and . every incident seriously.  I have already ordered immediate changes to . tighten up the system as a matter of urgency. 'With . immediate effect, prisoners will no longer be transferred to open . conditions or allowed out on temporary release if they have previously . absconded, and there will also be no unrestricted ""town leave"" .

Chelsea Coyne, 28, pounced on the woman from behind, before kicking her and punching her as she lay defenceless on the pavement. Seconds later Rachael Coyne, 25, swiped her mobile phone. The attack on the 48-year-old grandmother was caught on the Mitre Hotel's CCTV cameras and helped secure the convictions of the Coynes, who have now been sentenced for the attack.

As she chatted to her son on her phone outside the venue, Chelsea Coyne ‘jumped’ her, with the brunette repeatedly kicking the victim and punching her in the head. Subhanur Chowdhury, prosecuting, said: 'She was speaking with her son on her mobile phone. 'At . that point, she was jumped on and ended up on the floor. She was being . repeatedly kicked whilst on the floor and being punched around the head. 'She manages to get up then realises that she had dropped the phone.'

The victim suffered ‘substantial injuries’ to . her face and forehead and lost hair on the back of her head when it was . pulled during the attack, the court was told. The woman, a grandmother-of-four from Ancoats, said she suffers from headaches following the incident. 'I feel like I am living a nightmare,' she said in a statement read to the court. 'It is so hard to put into words. I feel embarrassed.' Chelsea Coyne pleaded guilty to assault following the attack in December last year. Her sister-in-law Rachael Coyne picked up the woman’s white iPhone after she dropped it during the attack and both then walked away. The blonde denied theft but was found guilty after a trial. The court heard the victim had returned to the pub the day after the attack and secured the CCTV footage for the police. Dominic Ingle, defending, claimed the victim suffered from alopecia, which had contributed to her hair loss. He said: 'It was an unpleasant assault but there is far more to this than meets the eye. 'This is not a black and white matter. They are genuinely good people. They have made a very, very, severe mistake.' Chelsea Coyne, of Miles Platting, Manchester, was sentenced to a six-month community order and a six-week curfew. Rachael Coyne, also of Miles Platting, was sentenced to a 12-month community order with 150 hours of unpaid work.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . In its most hospitable regions, Mars shares some similarities with the most extreme regions of Earth. Now researchers have shown that some of the simplest and oldest organisms on our planet could also survive on the Martian surface. Named methanogens, these organisms use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to metabolise and produce methane. Researchers have shown that methanogens - some of the simplest and oldest organisms on our planet - could also survive on the Martian surface. Methanogens in these test tubes, which also contained growth nutrients, sand and water, survived when subjected to Martian freeze-thaw cycles at the University of Arkansas . Methanogens live in swamps and marshes, but can also be found in the gut of cattle and termites, as well as in dead and decaying animals. These ancient and highly-specialised ‘extremophiles’ are thought to be able to grow quickly in harsh conditions. They are anaerobic, so they don't require oxygen. They also don't require organic which suggests they could exist in sub-surface environments. The survival of these two methanogen species exposed to long-term freeze/thaw cycles suggests methanogens could potentially inhabit the subsurface of Mars. Pictured is a microscopic view of a methanogen . Nasa chiefs have said that sending a manned mission to Mars is 'necessary if the human race is to survive'. But . the huge amounts of chemical rocket fuel needed to complete such a . mission would require deep pockets – the launch costs alone would be . more than $12 billion (£7 billion). Added . to this is the time it takes. The space agency estimates that a . round-trip human expedition to Mars would take more than four years . using current technology. Rocket-powered . fusion, however, could one day allow 30- and 90-day expeditions to Mars . by making the trip more practical and less costly, experts claim. Scientists . envision using a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen to very high . temperatures, which will then expand through a spacecraft’s nozzle to . generate thrust. Recent . advances in manipulating nuclear fusion could means that astronauts are . now a step closer to our nearest planetary neighbour. Researchers from the University of Arkansas wanted to see if two species of methanogens could withstand Martian freeze-thaw cycles below the organisms’ ideal growth temperatures. Methanothermobacter wolfeii was placed in a chamber 55°C (131°F) and Methanobacterium formicicum in one at 37°C (98.6°F). The two species were selected because one is a hyperthermophile, meaning it thrives under extremely hot temperatures, and the other is a thermophile, which thrives under warm temperatures. ‘The surface temperature on Mars varies widely, often ranging between -90°C and 27°C over one Martian day,’ said Rebecca Mickol, a doctoral student at the University of Arkansas. ‘If any life were to exist on Mars right now, it would at least have to survive that temperature range. ‘The survival of these two methanogen species exposed to long-term freeze/thaw cycles suggests methanogens could potentially inhabit the subsurface of Mars.’ A separate study earlier this month found that superbugs from Earth could soon hitch a ride into space, arrive on the red planet and trick scientists into thinking they are Martians. This study was done by Nasa researcher, Dr Kasthuri Venkateswaran, who expressed serious concern that microbes may beat humans in the race to colonise Mars. Dr Venkateswaran highlighted recent research that showed some bugs were more resilient than first thought and could use protective mechanisms to survive deep space flights. Currently, spacecraft landing on Mars or other planets where life might exist must meet requirements for a maximum allowable level of microbial life. These acceptable levels were based on studies of how various life forms survive exposure to the challenges associated with space travel.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Legal action: Three women who were assaulted by jailed Max Clifford are suing the disgraced PR guru, just a day after his wife divorced him . Three women who were assaulted by jailed Max Clifford have today revealed they are suing the disgraced PR guru, just a day after his wife divorced him. The 71-year-old, who was thought to be worth £10m before his trial at Southwark Crown Court, was sentenced to eight . years in prison earlier this month for eight assaults on four women . between 1977 and 1984. Today one of the women taking legal action said: 'I was young and impressionable when I met Max Clifford and he used that to exploit me. It is right that he is held accountable for his actions.' Clifford fell from grace after decades influencing the media when he became the first person to be successfully prosecuted under sex crime investigation Operation Yewtree. A number of his current and former high profile clients moved to distance themselves from the veteran agent in the wake of the string of guilty verdicts and his subsequent jail term. The women’s solicitor Richard Scorer, of Slater and Gordon, said: 'Clifford used his fame and public persona as a cloak to mask his sexual perversions. We are investigating all of Clifford’s assets, including those of his companies, Max Clifford Associates and Max Clifford Media. 'We represent three women who have approached us for advice and we fully expect others to follow. I urge all of his victims to seek legal advice with a view to redress under the law.' Clifford has two large homes in Hersham, Sussex, one he valued at £3.5million in 2008 and another, which his daughter Louise lives in, he valued at £2.5million five years ago. The Land Registry says property prices in the area have increased by around five per cent a year since then, meaning the two homes could now have a combined worth of up to £8million. The PR expert also has a house in an exclusive golf development in the hills near Nuevo Andalucia, southern Spain, which he valued at £1.5million in 2008. Clifford has said he made £2.5million a year from his PR work. The latest accounts for his company, Max Clifford Associates, in 2012 show a turnover of around £3.5million and give the firm an estimated worth of £1.2million. Jailed: The 71-year-old, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court, was sentenced to eight years in prison earlier this month for eight assaults on four women between 1977 and 1984 . Worth: Clifford was thought to be worth around £10million before his trial, and owns a number of properties including this house near Walton on Thames, Surrey . He has also boasted that he got a new Bentley - each worth £200,000 - every two years. However, his legal bills are thought to amount to more than £250,000 and it has been claimed that he has written to previous clients asking for their financial help to meet these costs. Yesterday a judge signalled an end to Clifford’s four-year marriage to wife Jo as the couple were granted a decree nisi in the Central Family Court in London. Neither was at the hearing, which lasted just 105 seconds, although each was represented by a lawyer. Divorce: Clifford's wife Jo, pictured with him arriving at Westminster Magistrates' Court in May last year has divorced him, with the marriage ending yesterday . In happier times: Legal papers showed that Mrs Clifford had filed for divorce on the grounds of 'unreasonable behaviour' Divorce papers showed that Mrs Clifford had filed for divorce on the grounds of 'unreasonable behaviour'. She said Clifford’s behaviour had affected her health and had written: 'I suffered from stress and had heart palpitation and saw a specialist.' Mrs Clifford had signed the petition on August 14 2013. And she noted the date of the 'final incident' she relied on as August 18 2012 - nearly four months before Clifford was arrested on suspicion of committing sex offences. Lawyer Raymond Tooth, who represented Mrs Clifford, said after the hearing: 'Everything has been settled amicably.' Clifford remained defiant despite the guilty verdicts in his trial and his lawyers said they planned to appeal against his sentence, and potentially his conviction.","Clifford jailed for eight years earlier this month at Southwark Crown Court .

"By . Steve Nolan . It looks more like a lush green meadow than a popular coastal resort, and with tonnes and tonnes of tangled seaweed lining the shores and floating on the water, would you really want to take a swim? It seems that nothing will deter these sunseekers from having a fun day in the sun in China. These pictures show beachgoers frolicking in swathes of green algae on the beach in Qingdao in the eastern Shandong province. Scroll down for video . Fancy a swim? A sun seeker on the beach at Qindao, China, relaxes on a pile of the green algae that has swamped the popular patch of coastline . Healthy and happy: Not only is this woman reaping the benefits of the healthy seaweed - she is also staying healthy by keeping out of the sun . Green eyed monster: this man has been buried in the non-toxic algae by his friends as they play in the seaweed . Swamped: The popular and normally picturesque stretch of coastline has already seen tonnes of the green stuff removed . Covered: An aerial view of the algae covered Qingdao beach in China . Around 20,000 tonnes of the stuff has already been removed from the beach in the last few days with the coast swamped in green since early last month. But the algae is likely to do no harm to those swimming in it - it is non poisonous Enteromorpha prolifera, an edible seaweed which is even praised for its health benefits. The form of algae, also known as sea lettuce, is said to be rich in magnesium and many other nutrients, a vitamin-rich food source that can help improve skin and lower blood pressure. But clean up teams will have to work quickly to clean up the green stuff, before it decomposes and begins to rot - for sea lettuce can produce large quantities of hydrogen sulphide, a toxic gas. Healthy: Not only is the seaweed said to be non-toxic, it is also lauded for its health benefits and is edible . Is it a bird? As if swimming in the stuff isn't bad enough, this young swimmer launches a load of seaweed through the air at his friend . Taking a stroll: You'd be forgiven for thinking that this woman was walking across a lush meadow, she is in fact ankle deep in algae swathed sea water . Relaxing: This child looks delighted to be playing in the algae, perhaps because it is good for him . As well as being nutritious for humans, the algae is also a source of sustenance for sea creatures including manatees. More than 10,000 volunteers helped clear the same coastline back in 2008 when the beach - which was due to host the Beijing Olympic sailing events - was swamped by some 20 square miles of algae. The government even had to step in to ensure that the Qingdao sailing venue was ready in time for the games, sending in soldiers to help clear it up. This particular type of seaweed can grow up to 50cm in length, typically growing near the shore, on rocks or other algae, on open coasts or in estuaries and harbours. Officials have blamed warm seas for bringing in the algae in the past, but many scientists blame pollution for the phenomenon. Some experts say that the algae blooms in water with high levels of nutrients blaming farmers using too much fertiliser on their crops and cities falling to treat sewage properly. Come on in, the water's lovely: A swimmer's head pokes through a luscious green surface that resembles a swamp more than a picturesque coast . Safe and stylish: This women may look as though they are about to rob a bank, but they are in fact just shielding their faces from the glare of the sun . Staying safe: The nylon masks were invented by a local designer some eight years ago and have become increasingly popular since . Double benefits: The masks also protect wearers from being stung by jellyfish . Not only were beachgoers able to reap the rewards of bathing in tonnes of healthy seaweed, but some also went to extreme measures to ensure their skin wasn't damaged by the sun. Many beach goers donned bizarre looking nylon masks designed to protect wearers from the glare of the sun's rays so that they don't have to wear sun cream. The masks are the brainchild of a local designer and have become increasingly popular since they were launched around eight years ago.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Inflation has risen for the first time in 10 months, dashing hopes of an early end to the squeeze on family incomes. Travel firms bumping up plane and ferry ticket prices by a fifth for the Easter holidays were a major factor in the rise in the Consumer Prices Index to 1.8 per cent. Latest figures show annual wage increases were stuck at 1.7 per cent, meaning incomes are still being outstripped by the rising cost of living. The rise in inflation to 1.8 per cent means prices are still rising faster than wages, which are up by 1.7 per cent . Today’s figures are the first rise in CPI since June 2013. The Office for National Statistics said: ‘This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in April 2013 would have cost £101.80 in April 2014.’ A sharp rise in transport costs was by far the largest factor for the increase in overall prices, the ONS said. ‘Prices, overall, increased between March and April 2014, compared with a fall between the same two months a year earlier. ‘Air fares and sea fares were the two largest contributors to the rise, with prices increasing by 18 per cent and 22 per cent on the month respectively. ‘This compares with a fall of 6 per cent and a rise of 3 per cent for air fares and sea fares on the month a year ago. The timing of Easter was likely a factor in both cases.’ Transport costs, especially air and sea fares, were the biggest factor in the increase in inflation . Labour leader Ed Miliband was put on the spot about his own finances . Ed Miliband was today accused on live TV of being out of ‘touch with reality’ after underestimating his family's weekly food shopping bill. The Labour leader, who has attacked the government over the cost of living, claimed he spent around £70 or £80 a week on groceries. But he appeared taken aback when told the average bill for a family of four is more than £100, as he claimed his £140,000 salary meant he was ‘relatively comfortably off’. Appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Mr Miliband claimed the ‘cost-of-living crisis is the biggest issue that our country faces and I am determined we tackle it’. But he was put on the spot about how much it really costs to feed a family of four. Asked about the average weekly household grocery bill, Mr Miliband responded: ‘It depends on how much you are spending.’ Pressed on his own family's bill, Mr Miliband said: ‘We probably spend £70, £80 a week on groceries at least, probably more than that. ‘The point is that different families will have different costs that they face but what I am clear about is that there is a crisis facing so many people.’ But TV presenter Susannah Reid took him to task for appearing out of touch. She told him: ‘The average weekly bill for a family of four is more than £100. So you are going to be spending significantly more than £70 or £80. ‘People will say one of the problems with politicians is they are actually talking about something but not in touch with reality.’ The cost of clothes and shoes also rose between March and April, having remained flat a year ago. The price of food and drink fell by 0.5 per cent, with vegetables down after a better growing season this spring. Ministers had hoped to see wages over-take inflation by now, which would have meant people felt better off each month. Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘'Today's figures are further evidence that our long term plan to fix the economy is working. ‘Low inflation helps families cope with the cost of living and helps businesses plan for the future. ‘As a result of the Liberal Democrats and our coalition partners taking the difficult decisions needed to stick to the economic plan we are now seeing a pattern of strengthening growth, strong job creation and stable prices. ‘These factors are combining to create the right climate for the increased business confidence and investment that we need to secure this hard earned recovery.' Experts at Capital Economics said the rise in inflation looked likely to be a ‘blip’ almost entirely reflecting the timing of Easter. Capital's UK economist Samuel Tombs said the trend should continue to be down over the rest of 2014 as commodity prices stabilise, import prices fall and supermarkets and other retailers step up competition. He said: ‘We continue to think that CPI inflation should ease to as low as 1 per cent by the end of this year and remain comfortably below the 2 per cent target in 2015.’ But James Knightley, of ING Bank, said there were tentative signs of wages picking up, with momentum building over the coming year and good indications of hiring intentions. ‘In an environment of firm economic growth and strengthening corporate pricing power we feel that CPI will gradually grind higher over coming quarters,’ he said. The Bank of England said last week that it expected inflation to remain at or below its 2 per cent target for the next few years, easing pressure on it to hike interest rates. It has been helped by a 10 per cent rise in the value of sterling since last year, keeping the cost of imported goods down. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The latest figures show that inflation remains below the target rate and well below half of the peak in September 2011. ‘Lower inflation and rising job numbers show that the Government's long-term plan is working and Britain is coming back. ‘The biggest risk to economic security would be abandoning the plan that is creating a brighter economic future.’","Consumer Prices Index rise to 1.8% in April, first increase since June 2013 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Thanks to healthier and more active lifestyles, many believe we can reach 90 before being considered old . Old age begins at 80 – almost 20 years later than previous generations believed. Thanks to healthier and more active lifestyles, working later in life and more public awareness of the elderly and their needs, older people are staying younger longer. More than one in five Britons even believe you can reach 90 before you are considered old, a study of 2,000 over-40s says. It found falling asleep while watching TV or reading the paper, becoming forgetful and groaning when you get out of bed show you are getting old. Saying 'back in my day', choosing comfort over style and having an afternoon nap also feature in the top ten. A spokesman for the comparison website PayingTooMuch.com, which commissioned the research, said: 'Perceptions of old age have changed a lot over the last few years. 'There was a time when you were considered old or past it as soon as you retired, but this age has now got much later as we are leading healthier and more active lives well into our 70s. 'Pensioners are no longer seen as people who spend their days sat in their armchair knitting or watching black and white films in the afternoon before a little nap. 'For many, retirement is the start of a whole new chapter and pensioners are travelling the world, taking up new hobbies and in some cases, leading more active and exciting lifestyles than when they were younger. 'As well as this, people are working later in life than ever before and even if they don't feel particularly young or fit, it adds to the illusion that they are still young. 'But while you might not be 'old' until much later in life now, it's important not to put off decisions regarding retirement or later years such as life insurance, wills or pensions. 'Old age might seem far off for most, but it's better to be prepared now than regret not doing something later on.' Many put the perception down to figures like the Queen, who is still active at the age of 88 . Eighty-five per cent put this down to people living longer, while almost two thirds think it's due to pensioners leading more active lifestyles. Other reasons include working until later in life, leading healthier lifestyles and people being more independent later in life. Almost one in five even believe it's because of the number of celebrities and famous figures, such as Queen Elizabeth and Bruce Forsyth - who are both well into their eighties - still working and in the spotlight.","More than 1 in 5 believe you can reach 90 before you're considered old .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nigel Farage was forced to pull the plug on his latest attempt to prove Ukip is not racist, after a steel band refused to play at a bizarre 'Carnival' in Croydon. The Ukip leader hoped it would be a 'bold and vibrant' event to defy his critics, but organisers were confronted with protesters likening the party to Nazis. Mr Farage abandoned plans to attend after opponents clashed with party members, the steel band walked out and a Ukip candidate branded Croydon a 'dump'. Ukip supporters clash with opponents in Croydon town centre where their leader Nigel Farage was due to speak, but didn't turn up . A steel band booked to play at the event instead packed up before Mr Farage had arrived . Band members said they were 'embarrassed' to be there, and packed up before Ukip leader Nigel Farage arrived . Ukip yesterday paid for a full-page advert in a national newspaper insisting it was not racist. Today's event, staged in front of a shop window with the slogan 'Love Colour' was a follow-up to a rally Mr Farage held featuring candidates and members from ethnic minorities. In an apparent admission that the party had to do more to prove it was not racist, the street rally was organised in Croydon. But Ukip candidates and supporters clashed with protesters and campaigners. Romanians carrying banners about Nazis argued with party members about Nigel Farage's remarks last week about Romanian neighbours. Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who sparked controversy with comments about Romanians during an interview on LBC last week, was forced to abandon plans to visit Croydon . The event was supposed to draw a line under recent controversies over comments made by Ukip candidates . Instead the 'carnival' descended into a stand-off between protesters and Ukip members, with journalists looking on . Organisers seemed unprepared for the number of protesters accusing Ukip of being Nazis . Ukip strategists cancelled Mr Farage's visit at the last moment, claiming there was a security threat . Ukip are expected to top the European Parliament elections on Thursday, which Mr Farage says will trigger a political earthquake . Winston McKenzie, a black Ukip candidate in Thursday's election, clashed with black teenagers in a debate over whether he was a leader of the community while also being in the party. He used a megaphone to make a speech urging people to make Britain great again. Mr Farage was due to attend the event, dubbed a carnival or street party, on Croydon High Street. In his speech, Mr McKenzie said: 'I want to thank all of the patriotic people in this country who are fed up, let down by the situation. 'I'm sick to death... of hearing the same rhetoric come from the same stale political parties. 'It's time people woke up and realised this country is being disenfranchised.' Protesters waved placards branding Ukip the 'modern Nazi party' as they disrupted the street event . Ukip officials struggled to maintain control and eventually cancelled Mr Farage's vist . Ukip council candidate Winston McKenzie tried to shout down opponents on Croydon High Street . Mr McKenzie said Mr Farage would not be attending because as a family man and party leader 'certain situations you have to avoid' Mr McKenzie said there was no choice but to cancel the event, adding: 'Croydon is unsafe and a dump' Police officers watched over the peaceful but heated clashes outside the Whitgift Shopping Centre. The Endurance Steel band, which included black members, told reporters they were 'embarrassed' to be there because they did not think that people should vote for Ukip. Winston McKenzie, a Ukip council candidate in Croydon, tried to silence critics using a megaphone. Standing in front of a Ukip battlebus he addressed a small group of party members. But as he was shouted down by opponents, it emerged that Mr Farage had cancelled a visit to the town. Mr McKenzie confirmed Mr Farage would not be attending, citing security concerns. He told reporters: 'He's a responsible family man and political party leader. Certain situations you have to avoid.' Mr McKenzie added: 'Croydon is unsafe and a dump.' Protesters told Ukip to 'f*** off' and challenged them over remarks by one council candidate who said comedian and actor Lenny Henry should emigrate to a 'black country'. At an event on May 7 Mr Farage posed with black and Asian supporters to insist: 'Don't call us racist' Amjad Bashir, the party’s small and medium size business spokesman, is pictured shaking Mr Farage's hand after telling the rally: ‘Take a look at all the faces and skin colours represented on this stage and tell me Ukip is a racist party' It came after Mr Farage was condemned by politicians from the three main parties after declaring in a radio interview last week that everyone knows ‘the difference’ between Romanians and Germans. Mr Farage’s second wife Kirsten is German. The Ukip leader yesterday attempted to backtrack, saying the vast majority of Romanians were ‘good people’. ‘If I gave the impression... that I was discriminating against Romanians then I apologise certainly for that,’ the Ukip leader said on a campaign visit to Ramsgate. He said people would – rather than should – be concerned about Romanian neighbours. He added: ‘Can we just have an honest appraisal of what has happened to post-communist Romania? Across the whole of the European Union, amongst all 28 member states, 7 per cent of all crime is committed by 240 Romanian gangs.’","Members of the steel band say they are 'embarrassed' to be there - and leave .

"By . Lucy Crossley . The price of cereals such as Corn Flakes could surge by as much as 44 percent in the next 15 years because of climate change, Oxfam has warned. The charity has claimed the 'Big 10' food and drink companies combined emit more greenhouse gases than Scandinavia, and has warned these firms could face financial ruin if they do not do more to tackle climate change. Oxfam says were companies Associated British Foods, Coca-Cola, Danone, General Mills, Kellogg, Mars, Mondelez International, Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever a country, they would rank as the 25th most polluting. Costly: Oxfam has warned that the price of cereals such as Corn Flakes could surge by as much as 44 percent in the next 15 years because of climate change . In its new report Standing on the Sidelines, the international agency says these firms emit 264 million tons of greenhouse gases, according to the latest available figures, more than the combined 250 million ton total for Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. Oxfam says food supplies are being affected by storms, . floods, droughts and shifting weather patterns caused by climate change, which is leading to more hunger and . poverty. It has been predicted that by 2050 there will be 50 million more . people made hungry because of climate change, and Oxfam has suggested that the price of key products like Kellogg's Corn Flakes could rise by 44 percent by 2029. In its critical report, the charity has called on the firms, which is says generate £650 million a day in revenues - equivalent to the total gross domestic product of all the world's lower income countries - to cut their combined emissions by 80 million tons by 2020. Singled out: Oxfam said Kellogg, which produces cereals including Corn Flakes and Rice Crispies, and General Mills, which encompasses brands including Haagen-Dazs, were two of the 'worst' firms on climate . 'By failing to cut emissions adequately the 'Big 10' are putting short term profits ahead of the long term interests of both themselves and the rest of us,' said Oxfam's director of UK campaigns and policy Sally Copley. 'Their influence and wealth are the . perfect ingredients to stop putting their businesses at risk and making . climate change worse. 'They need to look at the whole picture from how their ingredients are grown to how their goods are produced to cut emissions. 'They . also need to pressure businesses and governments to do what is needed . to tackle climate change and help build a future where everyone has . enough to eat.' Worry: Experts say climate change could lead to more extreme weather, such as super storm Sandy which devastated parts of Long Island, New York in 2012 . Oxfam says that the food industry drives around 25 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and that these emissions are growing as demand for food rises. 'Experts say that if the world is to . avoid warming of more than 2C, rising emissions from deforestation and . agriculture need to be reversed by 2050 and agriculture and forests need . to together become a carbon sink - effectively removing greenhouse . gases from the atmosphere,' said an Oxfam spokesman. 'Their influence and wealth are the perfect ingredients to stop putting their businesses at risk and making climate change worse' Sally Copley from Oxfam on the 'Big 10 . Oxfam says some of the companies, Unilever, Coca-Cola, and Nestle, had taken steps to tackle climate change, and that Pepsico UK had committed to reduce emissions from its agricultural supply chain by 50 percent in five years. But it singled out Kellogg, which produces cereals including Corn Flakes and Rice Crispies, and General Mills, which encompasses brands including Haagen-Dazs and Jus-Rol, as two of the 'worst' on climate. In its report the charity called on these companies to lead the other firms towards more responsible policies and practices. Oxfam also urged the firms to disclose their agricultural emissions and biggest polluting suppliers, . and set targets to cut emissions from their supply chains. A spokesman from Kellog told MailOnline: 'Kellogg is committed to doing what’s right for the environment and society. As part of this commitment, we are working to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions – along with energy use and water use – by 15–20 percent at our manufacturing facilities by 2015. Work: Women in north west Kenya with a goat funded by Oxfam. The charity has warned that 50 million more people could go hungry as a result of climate change . 'We’re pleased to see that Oxfam has recognized our commitment to working with global palm oil suppliers to source fully traceable palm oil, produced in a manner that’s environmentally responsible, socially beneficial, and economically viable. We’ve also made continuous improvements in the areas of Land, Women, Climate and Water. 'We value continued engagement and discussion with Oxfam, and other external stakeholders on the important issues of environmental and social sustainability.' A General Mills spokesperson added: 'Climate Change is a serious issue, and as a food company we are very aware of the impact that climate change could have on agriculture and the world’s food supply. 'General Mills has been actively engaged in positively influencing climate policy and has been taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its operations for many years.'","Oxfam says firms could face financial ruin if they don't tackle climate change .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Warning: Police constable Alex Denny (pictured) and his colleagues have put up posters around Worcester warning in both English and Polish that drinking in the streets is banned . Police battling to stop Eastern Europeans binge drinking in the street have put up posters in Polish warning them that alcohol is banned. Officers in Worcester had the message translated to represent the 'multi-cultural' nature of the city, following complaints migrants were getting drunk in public. The signs - which are written in both English and Polish - warn people that drinking in alcohol-free zones can result in an on-the-spot £60 fine. West Mercia Police have found the city is home to a growing number of people from Eastern European countries, and there have been complaints of Polish men being among those seen drinking cans and bottles of alcohol in public. Constable Alex Denny, who started putting up 30 of the plastic weather-proof signs today, said his colleagues often encountered Polish drinkers. He added: 'There is a reasonable proportion of people we encounter in this locality who are Polish but all the signage we have is in English and they may not be aware they are drinking in an alcohol-free zone. 'The idea of this is to raise awareness to prevent people violating the conditions. 'Worcester is a multi-cultural city and there are people of a variety of nationalities living in the Lowesmoor area, which is a positive reflection on the city. 'A number of the drinkers we encounter are English males but there are also Polish males. 'What we are trying to do is make the legislation more easily understandable to the people we encounter. 'If we can educate people rather than reprimand them then that is something we would rather do.' The black and yellow signs have been put up in areas across Worcester, which have been the subject of complaints by residents and businesses, so drinkers can’t plead for leniency and claim they could not read English warnings. Poster: Officers in Worcester had the message translated to represent the 'multi-cultural' nature of the city, following complaints migrants were getting drunk in public . West Mercia Police say the signs are part of Operation Spartacus which has cut alcohol-related anti-social behaviour since it was launched last October. Anyone caught drinking in the no-alcohol zones can face an on-the-spot £60 fine and have their alcohol seized. They can also be served with a dispersal order, arrested or even given a criminal anti-social behaviour order.

"By . Martin Robinson . A restaurant featured in a BBC documentary claims it threw away £4,000 of Michelin-star quality food because homeless charities refused to accept it. Aiden Byrne says he was forced to bin £70 Cumbrian veal cutlets, £50 steaks and £29 turbot fillets in Restaurant Wars; The Battle for Manchester because homeless groups turned the meals down on health and safety grounds. The show followed chefs Simon Rogan and Mr Byrne as they opened competing venues The French and Manchester House in Manchester, both with ambitions to win a Michelin Star. Controversy: Chef Aiden Byrne says he was forced to dump £4,000 of food during a BBC documentary on health and safety grounds . Controversial: Manchester House cooked the extravagant meals and served them to empty tables before they were dumped in the bin . Row: The food was binned after the 'stress test' on the day before the restaurant opened, which was widely criticised . Manchester House decided to test its full menu on the day before it opened, which led to 70 meals being cooked and not eaten. Critics: Celebrity chef James Martin said he was 'horrified' by the waste during Restaurant Wars . Waiting staff served them to empty tables before management tasted some of them before scraping the rest into the bin. The decision has been widely criticised, including by celebrity chef James Martin who said today he was 'horrified'. But Mr Byrne says that charities were offered the food but refused because his kitchen had not been vetted. He tweeted: 'For the record Manchester House offered food to homeless . organisations and it was declined because it wasn’t registered.' A colleague told The Times: 'Aiden did approach several charities, but was turned down because it was a spontaneous donation'. But despite the explanation James Martin said he had never seen anything like it. He said: 'When you’re making a programme like Restaurant Wars I know that . things are edited a certain way, but I didn’t like it, I didn’t like . what it represented and I didn’t enjoy it. 'When you have a scene . where you serve food for a restaurant full, but then chuck it all away, . I don’t like that at all, I was horrified to watch it. 'I’ve worked in a lot of restaurants in my time but that’s the first time I’ve ever seen that.' Fairshare, a charity that helps distribute food across Britain, says that millions of plates of food could be being wasted in this way. A spokesman said: 'We just can't work with restaurants at the moment because it is too hard to regulate pre-cooked food, which is a shame as millions of plates worth of amazing food are being thrown away each year'. In contrast Jennifer Davies tweeted: 'I think that’s . doubtful. I’ve given conference food to homeless orgs in the past and . there wasn’t an issue.' Panned: Viewers took to Twitter after becoming angry about the decision to throw away all the food . Response: Aiden Byrne responded to say that they had tried to give away the food but struggled because of red tape . Tim Bacon, CEO and Co-Founder of Living Ventures who are the owners . of Manchester House in partnership with Aiden Byrne said: 'The £4000 . food wastage figure mentioned was at sales price including . VAT and equates to .£1000 in real cost. Still a completely . unsatisfactory situation and is something we do very rarely.

"By . Tara Brady . Jeremy Paxman announced last month he is quitting the current affairs show Newsnight and it seems he is determined to make his final month the most explosive of them all. Tonight the presenter will stun Silvio Berlusconi when he asks the former Italian prime minister whether he did call Angela Merkel an ‘an un****able lard-a***?’. The disgraced politician was accused in 2011 of insulting his fellow European leader during a conversation with a newspaper editor. Tonight the presenter will stun Silvio Berlusconi when he asks the former Italian prime minister whether he did call Angela Merkel an 'an un****able lard-a***?' The alleged remarks were picked up by investigators probing a £660,000 blackmail plot against Berlusconi. It was not the first time the Italian leader was accused of insulting the chancellor. In 2009 he kept Mrs Merkel waiting at a summit while he chatted on his mobile telephone. The year before he ‘jumped’ out at her from behind a statue and shouted ‘peek a boo’ when she arrived in Italy for an official visit. In tonight's programme Paxman will ask Berlusconi: 'Is it true you called Angela Merkel an ‘unf*ckable lard-arse?’ The clip stops just short of Berlusconi's reply who looks completely dumbstruck. Berlusconi was found guilty of tax fraud in 2013, sentenced to four years in prison and lost his Senate seat as a result. However, he was spared prison as in Italy criminals over 70 rarely go to jail. Earlier this month the 77-year-old completed his first day of community service at an old people’s home as part of his sentence for tax fraud. As the disgraced former Italian prime minister arrived at the Catholic-run facility in Cesano Boscone, near Milan, one protester wearing a clown hat shouted: ‘You should be in prison!’ Berlusconi has been ordered to work four-hour shifts once a week for a year after being found guilty in 2013 of tax fraud in the acquisition of TV rights to films. In tonight's programme Paxman (right) will ask Berlusconi (left): 'Is it true you called Angela Merkel an ‘unf*ckable lard-arse?’ His tasks at the care home include entertaining Alzheimer’s patients and helping them with meals. The billionaire media mogul, who has dominated Italian politics for two decades, is leading his Forza Italia party’s campaign for the European elections despite being barred from standing as an MEP. Berlusconi was ordered to perform four hours of community service a week after his four-year sentence was reduced to one by a general amnesty. He also lost his Senate seat because of the conviction, but remains an important political force as head of his Forza Italia party. Paxman announced last month he would be retiring. In a statement he said: 'I have decided it is time to move on from Newsnight. 'After 25 years, I should rather like to go to bed at much the same time as most people.'","Disgraced politician accused in 2011 of insulting European leader .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . More young women say they would back reality TV star Joey Essex in an election than Nick Clegg, a new poll reveals. Just 1 per cent of women aged 18-30 surveyed by Cosmopolitan said they admire Mr Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, but 3 per cent said they would consider voting for Essex. In fact all of Britain’s party leaders proved so unappealing that most young women said they would rather vote for politicians who are from other countries or dead. Scroll down for video . More women aged 18-30 said they would back Joey Essex in an election, but just 1 per cent said they admired Nick Clegg . In the damning survey of the so-called ‘millenial’ generation of female voters, MPs were described as self-interested, deceitful and power hungry with just 1 per cent of women believing politicians to be hard-working, intelligent and essential. Margaret Thatcher is admired by 6 per cent of the women surveyed, while 4 per cent said they would vote for Prime Minister David Cameron. However, foreign politicians proved much more appealing with Barack Obama being the most admired on 35 per cent, followed by Hillary Clinton on 7 per cent. The research, based on 1,000 women aged 18-30 surveyed by Cosmopolitan, showed that 3 per cent said they would vote for former TOWIE star Joey Essex in a line-up of alternative candidates. Almost one in five - 19 per cent – said they would be more willing to vote if there was less lying and spin and if there was politicians they admired and trusted. Meanwhile 12 per cent want a completely new system and 62 per cent agreed with Russell Brand calling our political system ‘broken’, according to the research. Among the political parties, Labour was backed by 35 per cent, with the Tories in second on 17 per cent. Opinion was evenly split between Ukip and the Liberal Democrats with 7 per cent of women choosing to vote for both. The . Ukip vote has significant regional variation with the party having most . sway in East Anglia with 21 per cent of women stating they will vote . for them compared to no one in the East Midlands. Political . parties are not attracting young female talent to their ranks either . with 84 per cent vowing they would never consider it as a career, the . survey found. In . a list of career choices, being a politician scored marginally more . than being a stripper. The preferred career choices were teacher or . doctor, followed by journalist, model and banker. Louise .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Tragic: Brian Holland, 44, died of internal bleeding three years after he swallowed his own false teeth . A disabled man died of internal bleeding three years after he swallowed his own false teeth, an inquest has heard. Brian Holland, 44, who suffered from mytonic dystrophy, swallowed the upper dentures while vomiting in Offerton, Manchester, in May 2010. He was taken to hospital on May 9 last year after his condition deteriorated - with drastic weight loss, difficulty eating and coughing up blood. However, doctors and specialists were unable to find the cause of his symptoms, and he died following emergency surgery at Stepping Hill Hospital. Now, an inquest in Stockport has revealed that Mr Holland died from internal bleeding after the false teeth severed a major artery. A pathologist found the dentures had become . lodged in his lower oesophagus, before eventually wearing through the . oesophagus wall and perforating the aorta. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Coroner John Pollard said the hospital had 'missed opportunities' in treating Mr Holland, whose disease caused his muscles to gradually waste away. Mr Pollard said medical staff had been unaware that the patient had swallowed his false teeth - but would have discovered and safely removed the dentures if they had examined him thoroughly between May and July 2010. He added that Mr Holland’s treatment had been ‘less than optimal’ - and also criticised vital information not being included in his medical records and passed to other medical professionals. Scene: Mr Holland, who suffered from mytonic dystrophy, swallowed the dentures while vomiting in Offerton, Manchester, in May 2010. He died after emergency surgery at Stepping Hill Hospital (pictured) in May last year . 'A number of occasions and a number of opportunities to diagnose and successfully treat his condition were missed,' he said. Stockport NHS Foundation Trust has since apologised and carried out an investigation. A spokesman said improvements had been made at the hospital, including the introduction of an electronic system to record patient details. 'It is clear that we missed important opportunities in the care of Brian Holland and for that we are very sorry,' he added. Apology: Stockport NHS Foundation Trust has since apologised and carried out an investigation into his death . Mr Pollard said he he would write to the Department of Health and Stockport NHS, University of South Manchester NHS Trust, where Mr Holland was also treated, over the concerns raised during the inquest. He added that he would specifically ask for dentures to feature a metal marker on them so that they would show up on X-rays and scans.","Brian Holland, 44, swallowed his false teeth while vomiting in May 2010 .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Tragic: Samantha Maritza was sectioned in May 2010 after six suicide attempts but died during two hours of unsupervised release . A singer who killed herself while on leave from hospital had been sectioned after attempting suicide six times in three weeks. Samantha Maritza was killed when she stepped in front of a train travelling at 125mph in June 2010. It was just hours after the 21-year-old was released from St George's Hospital in Stafford on unescorted leave. Miss Maritza, the lead singer of up-and-coming electro band China Red, had been admitted to the ward the previous month when she tried to hang herself. After a further six attempts on her own life in three weeks - and diary entries mentioning trains - she was sectioned. But within a month, she was being prepared for unaccompanied day release away from medical staff and family. Despite warning their daughter wasn't ready, her parents claim their protestations went unnoticed. Later that day it emerged that she had . died in a fatal collision with a train at Lichfield Trent Valley and was . able to be identified by her treble clef tattoo. Today, her parents, Stephen, 57, and Joan, 55, have been paid a five-figure sum after launching a negligence claim against the hospital. South Staffordshire and Shropshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust settled with them out of court after refusing to accept liability. Miss Maritza, a trainee hairdresser, had suffered from depression for two years before her death. After making an attempt on her own life she agreed to be admitted and after a further six suicide attempts in three weeks she was sectioned. But despite being on anti-depressants, she dedicated her time to mentoring young musicians who lacked confidence. An . inquest in 2011 found Sam killed herself while mentally unwell and her . devastated family, including her brother Billy, 20, and sister Jamie, . 23, launched a negligence claim against the hospital. Her parents claim they protested her release but hours later she was found at Litchfield Trent Valley train station . The 21-year-old, singer of up-and-coming electro band China Red, mentored musicians lacking in confidence . The hospital did not admit liability and settled out of court. Amanda Godfrey, spokeswoman for South Staffordshire and Shropshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We are truly saddened by the death of Samantha and our condolences go to her family. 'In line with our usual policy, a full investigation was carried out into the circumstances surrounding her death and a number of changes have been implemented, including an emphasis to staff that patient notes must be completed in full and observation sheets correctly filed. 'We have also recently introduced a new clinical information system which will allow all staff to have access to electronic health records, offering more comprehensive and up to the minute detail on each patient.' Now her family are hoping to use the money to raise awareness about mental health problems, including contributing to the memorial fund they set up in her name - The Sam Maritza Trust. The Trust which runs St George's Hospital in Stafford today handed Mr and Mrs Maritza a five-figure sum after the family launched a negligence claim. The hospital denied liability but agreed to an out-of-court settlement . They are calling for changes to the procedures and care in relation to unescorted leave as they believe more families could be saved from the grief they have experience. Stephen said: 'We were hoping that this would be a warning for the hospital but we don’t think it has. 'Sam was in the worst situation possible to be left on her own. 'Although we were hoping that things were getting better and she was coming back to us, we weren’t even sure if she was taking her medication. 'It just didn’t add up and we can’t believe that letting her out alone was a risk they were prepared to take. The anger that came with our grief was horrific. 'We just wish they had given one more day to improve before she was let out on her own. It’s too late for Sam, we just hope we might be able to help someone else, to show that mental health problems are an illness not a weakness that needs to be hidden.'","Samantha Maritza admitted to St George's Hospital, Stafford, in May 2010 .

"By . Sam Webb . David Lowe, who was sacked after he played an old version of The Sun Has Got Its Hat On, claims the show was pre-recorded - but no one at the BBC approved it for transmission before it was played . The BBC DJ who left the BBC after accidentally playing a song with a racial slur in it claims it is on the corporation's approved list - and still is now. David Lowe, lost his job after playing a 1932 version of The Sun Has Got His Hat On during his Sunday night show on BBC Radio Devon. The version contains the line: ‘He’s been tanning n****** out in Timbuktu, now he’s coming back to do the same to you.’ Following . the broadcast, Mr Lowe immediately offered to apologise on air for his . error - but the corporation ordered Mr Lowe to 'fall on his sword' after . just one listener complained. According to the Mirror, the 68-year-old told The Jon Gaunt Show on Fubar Radio: 'When talking about my treatment, I prefer to use the word ‘inconsistencies’, rather than ‘double-standards’, because to the best of my knowledge, the version of the song I played was, certainly until just a few days ago, on the BBC’s ‘Okay to play’ list. ‘And one of my all-time favourites, Oliver’s Army by Elvis Costello, which features the N-word, is still played regularly on British radio.' Mr Lowe has said the show was . pre-recorded - but it not approved for transmission by station managers . as required by the BBC's compliance system. He added that the BBC management structure was 'flawed' and should be 'scrapped'. Mr Lowe said: 'I don’t have any quarrels with my BBC colleagues  - my quarrel is with the flawed system they are trying to work with. 'The BBC is trying to be all things to all men and women - and that’s an impossibility in anyone’s language.' Mr Lowe played a 1932 version of the son, performed by Amrbose & His Orchestra, on a Sunday night golden oldies show . A BBC spokeswoman said: 'David's show is a specialist music show and he played the track out of his own personal music collection. 'We don't have an 'approved' list. Nor do we have a 'banned' list. The . lyrics to The Sun Has Got His Hat On have been changed several times . since Noel Gay (above) and Ralph Butler wrote the original in 1932. It . was composed for the musical Me And My Girl and first recorded by the . Henry Hall BBC Dance Orchestra, with vocals by Val Rosing. The second verse went: ‘He’s been tanning n*****s out in Timbuktu, Now he’s coming back to do the same for you.’ More . recent versions have changed it to: ‘He’s been roastin’ peanuts out in . Timbuktu’ or just ‘shining brightly out  in Timbuktu’. 'We make editorial decisions about what records to play on a case-by-case basis taking a wide range of contextual factors into account. 'As we’ve made clear, we accept that the discussion with David Lowe about his future could have been handled better. 'We don’t ban records and the decision about which records to play on local or national radio is for individual producers or presenters, as it always has been. 'We make editorial decisions about what records to play on a case-by-case basis taking a wide range of contextual factors into account. 'David Lowe's weekly show was categorised as low risk and therefore did not require complex sign off procedures. 'We do not require managers to listen to programmes categorised as low risk if the producer of the programme is happy that it complies with BBC Editorial Guidelines. 'The producer in this case was David Lowe. 'The key point remains that we should not have accepted his resignation.' She added that the door remains open if he wishes to resume his show. Some have accused the BBC of double . standards for allowing Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson to keep his job . after mumbling the N-word in an outtake of his motoring show. Mr Lowe's former boss at BBC Radio Devon Roy Corlett, said at the time: ‘To end David’s career in this way when Clarkson was given a rap on the knuckles is absolutely appalling. 'It is an outrageous way to treat a loyal and distinguished employee. You couldn’t wish to meet a nicer man.’ Prime Minister David Cameron said his dismissal was 'slightly unfair' while Mayor of London Boris Johnson said the corporation acted in a 'disgraceful' way by firing the veteran DJ.","David Lowe, 68, played song containing the N-word on BBC Radio Devon .

"By . Sean Poulter . Cinema tickets prices are soaring meaning fewer people can go out to watch films . Families are cutting back on visits to the cinema amid spiralling prices both for tickets and snacks. The average ticket price has increased by more than 26 per cent since 2007 at the same time as incomes in working households have fallen by 6.4 per cent. At one time thousands of children would spend every Saturday morning at the cinema enjoying homemade dramas from the Children’s Film Foundation or serials from the USA. However, today a trip to see the latest blockbuster, whether that is X-Men Days of Future Past or Disney’s Maleficent, starring Angelina Jolie, is so expensive that it can only be an occasional treat. The latest figures from the Cinema Exhibitors’ Association put the average cinema ticket in the UK at £6.53, however families in London and the south face much higher prices. For example, tickets at the Odeon in Kingston, Surrey, work out at £12.70 for an adult or £36.40 for a family of four. Once you add in the cost of transport, popcorn and drinks, the cost could quite easily top £50. Researchers at the accountants Deloitte found even families with a household income of more than £55,000 are rationing their trips to the cinema. Deloitte said: ‘In a year in which British films and talent were recognised at many award ceremonies, 27 out of 73 constituencies in London had no cinema. This finding has led to suggestions that poorer people are less well served by the cinema industry. ‘A combination of price rises and falling incomes makes the cinema relatively less accessible, a trend reflected in the survey data, which shows that higher income groups are significantly more likely to visit the cinema than low-income groups. ‘Some 28per cent of those earning more than £58,000 per annum visited the cinema at least monthly, compared to 18per cent of those who earn less than £20,000.’ Similarly, 70per cent of households in the higher income bracket go at least twice a year, however this falls to 39per cent for those earning less than £20,000. As fewer people go to the cinema, it becomes increasingly difficult for the industry to build new ones and maintain those that exist, particularly in poorer areas. There have also been costs associated with providing new digital projection systems and sound systems. A family of four in Kingston, Surrey, will be set back more than £50 for travel, popcorn and tickets . Deloitte said: ‘A relatively small, two screen, 400-seat cinema costs around £3million to build, and the industry has had to absorb the capital costs of digitisation over the past decade, reducing the capital available to build new infrastructure. ‘It is therefore little surprise that large cinemas are being placed close to the richer audiences that guarantee returns.’ The report says the gradual decline in numbers going to the cinema was first noticed in 2009 and it could well mean that children deprived of the chance to go to the cinema as youngsters will stay away as grow older. ‘In the short term, the creative side of the cinema industry in the UK is unlikely to be affected by relative lack of supply. ‘The majority of funding for UK titles comes from overseas and the UK is a significant net exporter in film. ‘It would, however, be remiss not to ensure that the current creative vibrancy of the UK’s film production industry does not translate into a legacy of inspired younger people who wish to follow in the footsteps of great directors working in the UK, as well as world-leading on-screen talent and production crews.’","Average cinema ticket in the UK is £6.53, London prices more than £13 .

"By . James Rush . The Shard has been named the best skyscraper in the world after claiming first place in an international competition. The 306-metre tall building - the tallest in Europe - was praised by judges for its glass fragment-shape and sophisticated architecture. The buidling, which has become a significant part of the London skyline, won the Emporis Skyscraper Award after being chosen by an international panel of experts from more than 300 skyscrapers 100 metres or higher completed in the previous calendar year. The Shard has been named the best skyscraper in the world after it won the Emporis Skyscraper Award . The 306-metre tall building - the tallest in Europe - was praised by judges for its glass fragment-shaped form and sophisticated architecture . The Shard was chosen by an international panel of experts from more than 300 skyscrapers of at least 100 metres' height completed in the previous calendar year . The jury said: 'Construction of The Shard was complicated by the particularly tight site and therefore needed innovative planning. 'This makes the result all the more impressive: a skyscraper that is recognized immediately and which is already considered London's new emblem.' The building was designed by Renzo Piano, and officially opened in July 2012. The highest accessible part of it is the observation deck on the 72nd floor. Parts of it remain empty, with the latest part of it to be finished a branch of Shangri-La hotels which occupies from the 34th floor to the 52nd. The Emporis Skyscraper Award is one of the world's most renowned prizes for high-rise architecture and has been awarded annually since 2000. Each year a jury of experts from across the globe select a winner based primarily on aesthetics and functional design. The 250-metre tall Viennese DC Tower 1, by Dominique Perrault Architecture, won second place in the awards . Second place this year went to the 250-metre tall DC Tower 1, in Vienna, which was designed by Dominique Perrault Architecture. The building features three mirror-smooth sides broken by a jagged fourth. The skyscraper's comprehensive sustainability concept also impressed judges. The site features photovoltaics to . generate energy, local plants with low water requirements in the green . areas of the building, and electric car chargers to save on carbon . dioxide emissions. The Sheraton Huzhou Hot Spring Resort, on Lake Tai, near Shanghai in China, took third place. The 102-metre tall hotel, whose shape evokes a gigantic ring, was conceived by architects MAD, who also came up with last year's winner The Absolute World Towers, two blocks of high rise apartments dubbed the 'Marilyn Monroe of the architectural world'. The Sheraton Huzhou Hot Spring Resort, on Lake Tai, took third place in this year's competition . The flats earned the name because their hourglass figure is said to bear a similar shape to that of the Hollywood film star. Designed by MAD and Burka Architects they twist 209 degrees from their base to the top floor, 56 storeys up. This year's winners' list contained a total of five European projects - the last time so many were represented was six years ago. The Shard's victory is the fifth time the architecture prize has gone to Europe. However, after the award had gone in the last two years to Absolute World Towers in Canada and New York by Gehry at Eight Spruce Street in the U.S., no North American skyscraper features in the top ten this year.","The Shard chosen by international panel to win Emporis Skyscraper Award .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Daniel Chisholm was jailed for 12 years for his part in the 'cocaine factory' in Sunderland - but only has to pay £1 of the £750,000 earned . A cocaine dealer who made almost £750,000 from a drugs empire has been ordered to pay back just £1. Daniel Chisholm was handed a 12-year jail sentence earlier this year after being convicted of conspiracy to supply cocaine. The gang, which ran a 'cocaine factory' from a Sunderland flat, earned £742,814. Co-conspirator John Somerville, who was also jailed for 12 years for the same charge, was found to have a £16,094 stake in the business, which he has been ordered to pay back in full. But Chisholm, who amassed £742,814, only has to pay back £1 because the money is all gone. Four members of the cocaine gang were given prison sentences totalling more than 34 years in January. Police were following Somerville in April 2010 when they saw him throw a £12,500 block of cocaine out of the window of his Range Rover in Gateshead. That day, officers had followed him from his home to Sunderland to pick up Chisholm. After a short time Chisholm was seen to get out of Somerville's car, which then headed back towards Newcastle out of sight. When officers finally caught up with Somerville he had no drugs on him. However, they then found 248g of cocaine on a patch of grass nearby, which he had dumped. Officers watched on CCTV later that night as a team of men turned up in a minibus looking for the package. John Somerville (left) was sentenced to 12 years in jail, and Joseph Lewins (right) was jailed for nine years . Seven months later police raided Joseph Lewins' flat in nearby Washington and found it had been turned into a drugs factory. They recovered cocaine worth up to £750,000. Somerville, 53, Chisholm, 51, and Joseph Lewins, 55, were found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine. Lewins was jailed for nine years. Ronald Moon, 46, who pleaded guilty to money laundering, was jailed for 15 months. The case dragged Championship footballer Michael Chopra into the witness box. Blackpool's Michael Chopra, seen here in a match against Doncaster Rovers on Saturday, was dragged into a trial involving a drugs gang . The striker gave evidence in court claiming a £50,000 bundle found in the footwell of a car was money being used to pay off his gambling debts . The Blackpool striker, who had known Somerville for years, told the court £50,000 of the drugs money linked to him was in fact his gambling debts, which Somerville was helping him pay off. The court heard Somerville and Daniel Chisholm - who both had previous convictions for drug dealing - were 'central and key players' in the conspiracy. Jailing them for 12 years he said: 'You were close to the original source, although neither of you were absolutely the top of the tree.'","Daniel Chisholm jailed for 12 years but can only pay back £1 of the money .

"By . Richard Spillett . Divers have begun salvaging treasure from a ship that was accidentally blown up 350 years ago in the Thames Estuary. English Heritage is funding a two-year period of excavation of the wreck of HMS London, at a cost of £70,000. The huge vessel sank in the Thames Estuary, not far from where Southend Pier has since been built, in March 1665, after mysteriously exploding on a journey from Chatham, Kent. Scroll down for video . A computer generated image of what the wreckage of the HMS London looks like on the sea bed off Southend . A reconstruction of how the ship would have looked in its prime before it mysterious exploded in 1665 . A team of divers, funded by English Heritage, have now been given the go-ahead to salvage the contents of the ship before it breaks apart . Charitable Trust Cotswold Archaeology will salvage the ship's artifacts from the rapidly deteriorating vessel and everything they bring to shore will eventually go on display at the Southend Museum, Essex. The excavations began this week, with more dives planned for the coming months. English Heritage archaeologist Mark Dunkley said: 'We are hoping to recover some rare and well-preserved items which will provide a great insight into the English Navy during an unsettled time when Britain was emerging as a global power. 'The recovery and display of vulnerable artifacts will aid our understanding of life on board ship in the late 17th century and enable us to remove the wreck from our Heritage at Risk Register.' The wreck is about a mile from the end of Southend's famous pier and lies between eight to 12 metres deep, depending on the tides. Footage from the dives, which are taking place about 12 miles from Southend Pier in Essex . A signet pipe tamper ring is among the objects already recovered from the wreckage, which will eventually go on display in a museum . Divers say visibility is low around the wreckage but are still hopeful of recovering historical artifacts . The cost of the excavations will be covered by English Heritage's heritage at risk budget, as it feared the artifacts on board could be lost forever if the wreckage continues to break up. The ship was discovered in 2005 by contractors surveying the estuary for the Port of London Authority. The ship was immediately placed on English Heritage's at risk register as its fragile archaeological remains were being exposed by movement on the seabed. Clare Hunt, of Southend Council's Museums Service, said: 'This hidden wreck lies just off Southend Pier, which is visited by thousands each year, yet the wreck remains largely unknown.'

She added: 'It's part of our local as well as our national history and we're inviting local people to get involved in recording these ship finds.' Fishmonger Steve Ellis, who is an experienced diver, was part of a team who won the right to dive to wreckage in 2011. He said: 'Although the underwater dive . conditions are difficult with limited visibility, we are looking forward . to bringing up some exciting finds.' Exploratory dives suggest artefacts such as cooking utensils, ship fixtures, an anchor cable and even cannon balls may be found - although Mr Ellis admitted diving conditions may be tough. HMS London was a 64-gun, second-rate ship of the English Navy, built in 1656, one of three second-rate large ships built between 1642 and 1660. She gained fame as one of the ships which escorted Charles II home from Holland during the English Restoration. Three hundred people died when she sank on March 7, 1665, after a sailor is believed to have taken a candle below deck, sparking an explosion in the ship's gunpowder stockpile. The incident was covered in the diary of Samuel Pepys (right), who wrote: 'This morning is brought me to the office the sad newes of “The London,” in which Sir J[ohn] Lawson’s men were all bringing her from Chatham to the Hope, and thence he was to go to sea in her. 'But a little a’this side the buoy of the Nower, she suddenly blew up. About 24 [men] and a woman that were in the round-house and coach saved; the rest, being above 300, drowned: the ship breaking all in pieces, with 80 pieces of brass ordnance.' In October 2008, the ship was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act (1973). Her exact position has been kept a secret over fears illegal savage operations may be launched.","HMS London sank in 1665 after mysterious explosion off the coast of Essex .

"By . Tara Brady . A couple separated a little boy from his six brothers and sisters because they felt that he 'did not fit into the family', a High Court judge has heard. They decided to live as a 'divided family' with the mother and six children occupying one room and the father and little boy occupying another, Mrs Justice Russell was told. The little boy, now five, was 'largely confined' to a room with a gate placed across the doorway. Judge said the local authority with responsibility for the children was Lancashire County Council (pictured) He shared his father’s meals. Mrs Justice Russell said the little boy must have suffered 'significant emotional harm'. She said the depth of that harm might not become apparent until he was older. Detail of the little boy’s treatment has emerged in a written ruling by the judge following a hearing in a family court in Manchester. She wrote: 'He was seen as the problem and he and the other children must have known it; indeed the older children have said so. Mrs Justice Russell did not identify the couple but said they had lived in the Lancashire towns of Burnley and Blackpool (pictured) 'The emotional harm that this has caused his siblings is significant. The oldest three have expressed guilt and remorse at the way he was treated; they should not have been put in that position.' The judge ruled that all seven children - aged between 13 and three - should be taken into care. In her judgement she wrote: 'The plan of the local authority is not to place the children with permanent adoptive families; this is entirely appropriate given their ages and their close relationships as a sibling group and the need for them to continue to have regular contact with each other. 'The local authority must ensure that they are put in long-term placements where they can develop long-term and secure relationships so as to minimise the disadvantages that are inherent in the care system. 'The children must have regular, frequent and good quality contact which means that proper arrangements must be put in place.' She said all had probably suffered 'significant and long-lasting harm' as a result of their parents’ care. Mrs Justice Russell did not identify the couple but said they had lived in the Lancashire towns of Burnley and Blackpool. And the judge said the local authority with responsibility for the children was Lancashire County Council.","Lived as a 'divided family' with mother and six children in one room .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A former Eton College classics teacher caught with child pornography killed himself a decade later after he struggled to deal with the shame of his conviction, an inquest heard. More than 200 images of boys were discovered on Ian McAuslan's computer when he handed it to IT staff at the prestigious Berkshire school for a routine upgrade. The 68-year-old, who subsequently resigned from the school, admitted possessing and making indecent images of children in 2004 and was spared jail. Conviction: Former Eton classics teacher Ian McAuslan killed himself a decade after he admitted child pornography charges . However, an inquest heard today that he never recovered from his conviction and on March 16 of this year was found dead in the kitchen of his flat in Southampton, Hampshire. After the pictures were found on his computer police had raided his home and recovered a 20-year-old video which contained indecent images of children. He admitted two counts of possessing . indecent images of children and 14 of making them when he appeared at . Bracknell Magistrates’ Court in April 2004. When he was later sentenced at Reading Crown Court he was given nine months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years, and placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register for seven years. Find: More than 200 images of boys were discovered on Ian McAuslan's computer when he handed it to IT staff at the prestigious Eton College (pictured) for a routine upgrade . Judge Christopher Critchlow told him: 'You have a fine record as a . teacher and were clearly devoted to your profession. 'I give you the full credit for that long service and all that you have done in that career. 'It’s a tragedy for you and all who know you that your career should end this way.' Today an inquest in Southampton was told one of McAuslan's neighbours believed the 2004 conviction was linked to his death. 'He was very methodical, verging on obsessive compulsive disorder. Everything had it’s own place'Detective Constable Neil Smith . Police were called to McAuslan's home after concerns were raised over his welfare. Officers visited the flat twice, but received no response and prior to the third occasion spoke to a neighbour who gave them a key and told them he had seen McAuslan two days before. Detective Constable Neil Smith told the inquest that officers let themselves into the one bedroom property and found McAuslan's body in the kitchen with a bag over his head. Officers told the neighbour about the suspected suicide, and he is said to have replied: 'I thought that was the case.' DC Smith added: 'The neighbour said he was aware of Mr McAuslan’s conviction in 2004 and believed this was linked to his death.' The inquest was told that McAuslan had left a copy of his will on the table, alongside a number of personal letters, which he had written and signed. Officers also found a bottle of tablets in the lounge, which was almost empty, and there was a glass containing the 'remnants' of red wine. Spared jail: When McAuslan was sentenced at Reading Crown Court he was given nine months' imprisonment, suspended for two years, and placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for seven years . His sitting room contained thousands of books, drawers full of classical music, an 'expensive' HiFi, and a 3D Panasonic television on the wall. There was also a piano, and a number of computers. DC Smith added: 'Mr McAuslan was an only child and his parents had died some years ago. He had no next of kin. 'He was a lecturer at Eton College, where his chosen subject was Classics. 'He was very methodical, verging on obsessive compulsive disorder. Everything had it’s own place.' McAuslan was identified using the photograph on his driving licence, which was found in a bag. The inquest heard there was no evidence of a struggle, or forced entry, and the post mortem found no sign of natural disease. Consultant histopathologist Norman Carr, who conducted the post mortem examination, said there was a 'potentially fatal' level of a drug found in his blood, which could have reduced his breathing. Deputy coroner Gordon Denson said: 'I can only conclude from the content of the letters Mr McAuslan left that he had the intention before his death to take the actions he did.' He recorded a verdict of suicide, with the primary cause of death being asphyxia and the secondary cause toxicity.","Ian McAuslan, 68, admitted charges relating to indecent images in 2004 .

"By . Sam Webb . A man died in a suspected shooting that saw an entire village sealed off by armed police and led to three arrests this afternoon. Officers from Humberside Police were called to Melton, a small village just west of Hull, at around 5pm after reports from the public of a disturbance, possibly involving a   gun. When police arrived at the scene one man was found to have suffered serious wounds. He was treated by paramedics at the scene but they could not save him. The entire village of Melton, close to Hull in East Yorkshire, was sealed off after a suspected shooting where a man died . A second man was also found to be hurt and was treated at the scene. His injuries were not thought to be life-threatening. According to reports, armed police were stationed outside a local hospital where the man may be receiving treatment. Humberside Police said three men were arrested at the scene and were helping with inquiries. A force spokesman said: 'Police were called to a residential property in the Melton Old Road area of Melton at around 1700 this evening following reports of a disturbance   possibly involving a firearm. 'On arrival, officers found one man at the address who had suffered serious injuries. He was treated at the scene by paramedics but sadly pronounced deceased.

According to social media, up to 40 armed officers flooded into the village, which was partially sealed off by police. Humberside Police initially released few details of the incident, save to warn drivers that they faced long delays. Alison Peck, the new chairman of Welton Parish Council - the neighbouring village - who lives in Melton, said: 'It's very quiet, quite rural and normally very peaceable.' 'We are a small village of round about 300 houses with a large secondary school just around the corner.'

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Jailed: David McDougall, 31, raped a disabled woman just five days after being released on bail on other rape charges, a court has heard . A sex offender raped a disabled woman just five days after being released on bail on other rape charges, a court has heard. David McDougall, 31, carried out a string of rapes and other sexual and physical assaults on five women over a 15-year period in Fife, Scotland. He kicked one of the victims while she was pregnant - and raped another in front her baby son. But while awaiting trial for the offences, McDougall was released on bail at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court. Just five days later, he struck again, raping a 30-year-old woman with learning difficulties at her house on a night he knew she was alone. Now, McDougall has been jailed for 10 years after being convicted of 14 charges, including six rapes and other sexual and physical offences, dating back to 1998. The court heard that McDougall had been released on bail on May 28 last year while awaiting trial for attacks on five other females in the Fife towns of Methil, Buckhaven, Glenrothes and Kirkcaldy. Although prosecutors had opposed bail, a sheriff allowed it and appeal judges upheld his decision. But less than a week after walking out of Perth prison, McDougall raped the disabled woman on June 3 after turning up at her house, following her upstairs and trying to kiss her. The victim said he then forced her to have sex, adding: 'I didn't have the courage to tell him to stop.' McDougall initially denied being at the woman’s house on June 3 last year, but stains on the woman’s sheets were found to match his DNA. Case: McDougall raped the 30-year-old woman at her house on a night he knew she was alone. He has been jailed for 10 years after being convicted of 14 charges dating back to 1998 at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court (above) Sentencing McDougall yesterday, Judge Michael O'Grady QC branded the sex offender a danger to all women. He told him: 'You . have been convicted of an utterly appalling catalogue of domestic and . sexual offences. They are as bad as it has even been my misfortune to . encounter.' He added that his view that McDougall posed a significant danger to all women had been confirmed by a risk assessment report, which he said was 'deeply disturbing'. Scene: The court heard that McDougall had been released on bail on May 28 last year while awaiting trial for attacks on five other females in the Fife towns of Methil (pictured), Buckhaven, Glenrothes and Kirkcaldy . Attack: Although prosecutors had opposed bail, a sheriff allowed it and appeal judges upheld his decision. But on June 3 last year, McDougall raped the disabled woman. Above, Kirkcaldy, where one attack took place . As well as jailing McDougall for . 10 years, Mr O'Grady handed him an Order for Lifelong Restriction (OLR), set at five years. Introduced in June 2006, the OLR provides for the lifelong supervision of high risk violent and sexual offenders, even after they have been released from prison. Mr O'Grady said he had set the order at five years because some of McDougall’s crimes pre-dated the lifelong . restriction legislation . But he told McDougall the figure did not reflect when he would be released, adding: 'Responsibility for your release, if ever, is up to the parole board. My own view is that the prospect of your release is a distant one.' Solicitor advocate Gordon Martin, . defending, said the sex offender had accepted his involvement in 'almost all the charges' he was convicted of. 'For what it’s worth he has asked me to say he regrets . any harm or distress he has caused his victims and the embarrassment he . has caused his immediate family,' he added.","David McDougall, 31, raped and sexually assaulted five women in Fife .

"By . Sami Mokbel . Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM . Ravel Morrison could be handed a route back into West Ham's first-team fold next season to help Sam Allardyce's pursuit of sexy football. But uncertainty over his contractual situation is threatening plans to re-integrate the England Under-21 star back into the Hammers first-team fold. Allardyce has kept his job at Upton Park despite being under immense pressure from fans over what they perceive as his negative tactics. Back in town? Ravel Morrison could return to West Ham next season after being shipped out on loan . The former Bolton boss has been told his side must play more entertaining football next season and secure a top 10 finish. There is a feeling among the West Ham hierarchy that Morrison's attacking talents can help Allardyce achieve his targets next season. Morrison's early season displays for the Hammers last season put the forward on the cusp of the senior England squad. But after falling out of favour with Allardyce the former Manchester United man was sent out on-loan to Queens Park Rangers - much to the surprise of Hammers fans given he was arguably the club's most potent and entertaining player. However, there is a willingness from some at Upton Park for Morrison to be back involved with the West Ham first team next season given his attacking ability. Morrison's future at Upton Park, though, will depend on the outcome of summer contract talks. He has just 12 months left on his current deal - and if the club cannot agree a new contract then they will look to cash in on Morrison to avoid losing him on a Bosman next summer. Clinging on! Sam Allardyce has been given a stay of execution by the West Ham board this week . Worth the ticket alone! Morrison has the technique to excite supporters in east London next season . In addition, Morrison's relationship with Allardyce is likely to need some repair work ahead of the forward's possible return. Sportsmail sources have indicated that the 21-year-old's bond with Allardyce deteriorated in the weeks leading up to his loan move to QPR. Rangers boss Harry Redknapp could look to pounce on the uncertainty surrounding Morrison's future by making a permanent move for the forward should they win promotion to the Barclays Premier League. Likewise, Manchester City, who considered a move for Morrison in January, may look to the forward in their attempts to improve their homegrown quota for next season.","Midfielder was shipped out on loan to Queens Park Rangers .

"By . Adam Shergold . Follow @@adamjshergold . On Wednesday evening, England's Under 17 side will take on Holland in the final of the European Championships out in Malta. They will draw inspiration from the one and only other time England have lifted this trophy - just four years ago when they beat Spain 2-1 in Liechtenstein. That talented side featured the likes of Ross Barkley, Jack Butland, Saido Berahino, Josh McEachran and Connor Wickham. But what became of the other members of the Class of 2010? Sportsmail tracks their careers since their Euro triumph. Kings of Europe: England beat Spain 2-1 to lift the UEFA Under 17 European Championship trophy back in 2010 and they have another shot at glory when they face Holland on Wednesday night . Delirious: The England team celebrate on the field in Vaduz, Liechtenstein after their win over Spain . THE STARTING LINE-UP IN THE FINAL . Jack Butland . The goalkeeper played for Birmingham City at that point and had been named their Young Player of the Year prior to the tournament. His fine form continued at the finals, where he earned a place in UEFA'S 22-man technical team selection. Remaining understudy to Ben Foster, he enjoyed two profitable loan spells at Cheltenham Town in League Two and was attracting a great deal of interest from top clubs. In the end, after representing Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics in London, he moved to Stoke City for £3.5m on deadline day in January 2013. Now 21, Butland has been unable to displace Asmir Begovic as No 1 and spent the last season on loan at Barnsley and Leeds United. Aerial battle: Goalkeeper Jack Butland comes to claim a cross under pressure from defender Andre Wisdom and Spain's Jese Rodriguez . Bruno Pilatos . Was highly-regarded at Middlesbrough and had signed a four-year deal in 2010. A broken leg saw him depart the Riverside Stadium last year and he played for Darlington 1883 in the Evo-Stik League during the last campaign. Luke Garbutt . The left-back has progressed well in Everton's youth ranks and made his first-team debut as a substitute for Phil Jagielka in a Capital One Cup win over Leyton Orient back in August 2012. Has since spent time on loan at Colchester United, where he made 19 appearances in League One last season. A member of Peter Taylor's squad for the FIFA Under 20 World Cup last summer after Sam Byram had withdrawn through injury and capped once for the Under 21s, in a 6-0 win over Scotland at Bramall Lane. International duty: Luke Garbutt escapes the attentions of two Wales defenders during this week's Under 21 European Championship qualifier in Swansea . Conor Coady . The team captain in 2010, Coady continued to play for Liverpool's youth and Under 21 teams, and made his senior debut in a UEFA Europa League tie with Anzhi in November 2012. The centre-back made his Premier League debut in a 3-1 win over Fulham at the tail end of the 2012-2013 campaign, before spending last season on loan at Sheffield United. He made 50 appearances in all for the Blades in an extraordinary season that saw them flirt with relegation from League One before finishing seventh and reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Roaring lions: Conor Coady (left) celebrates with Andre Wisdom back in 2010 . Andre Wisdom . A . success story from the Class of 2010, Wisdom has made 22 senior . appearances in the Liverpool back line after being handed his debut by . Brendan Rodgers in a Europa League tie against Young Boys in . Switzerland. Signed a . new long-term contract at Anfield in January last year and spent a . successful campaign on loan at Derby County in which they reached the . Championship Play-off final. A regular in the England Under 21 squad. Nathaniel Chalobah . Chelsea starlet who has captained their reserve and youth sides, including the team that beat Blackburn Rovers in the final of the 2012 FA Youth Cup. After impressing in a loan season at Watford in 2012-2013, in which they reached the Championship Play-off final but lost to Crystal Palace, Chalobah signed a five-year contract with Chelsea. He spent last season on loan at Nottingham Forest and then Middlesbrough and has made 13 appearances for the England Under 21 side. Eyes on the prize: Nathaniel Chalobah is challenged by Wales player Lee Evans during this week's Under 21 international . Will Keane . One of the brightest prospects to emerge from the Old Trafford academy, Keane followed up his England success by guiding Manchester United to FA Youth Cup success against Sheffield United in 2011. Stepping up to the reserves, he was rewarded with a senior debut in the League Cup tie with Aldershot in October 2011 and a Premier League debut later that year. Niggling knee injuries checked his progress until this season, where he spent time on loan at Wigan and QPR, helping the London side to the Championship Play-off final. Capped three times for England Under 21s. Benik Afobe . Arsenal man Afobe is still waiting for his chance in Arsene Wenger's first team and has featured in their youth and reserve sides when not out on loan. Since the 2010 triumph, he has spent time at Huddersfield Town, Reading, Bolton Wanderers, Millwall and Sheffield Wednesday to gain experience. Tussle: Benik Afobe (right), of Arsenal, vies with Spain's Jese Rodriguez during the Euro 2010 final . Josh McEachran . The much feted McEachran is still waiting for a first team opportunity at Chelsea that grows less and less likely with every passing season. He made a first team debut for the Blues just a couple of months after the European Championship success against Zilina in a Champions League qualifier and made a number of appearances that season, leading to a five-year contract at Stamford Bridge in July 2011. Chelsea appeared to have grand plans for him but opportunities were limited and McEachran ended up on loan at first Swansea, then Middlesbrough, Watford and Wigan. The latter was fairly profitable, helping the Latics to the Championship Play-offs and an FA Cup semi-final, where he played against Arsenal. Waiting for a chance: Josh McEachran, seen here playing for England Under 17s in 2010, has spent much of his time out on loan . Ross Barkley . The outstanding success story of the Class of 2010, Barkley has advanced from Under 17 talent to member of Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad and a Premier League regular in just four years. He was one of the outstanding players of Everton's first season under Roberto Martinez and featured in 34 of their 38 league games en route to a fifth-place finish. The 20-year-old made his senior England debut against Moldova in a World Cup qualifier back in September 2013 and was shortlisted for this season's PFA Young Player of the Year Award. Before winning a regular starting berth at Everton, he spent a little time at Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United on loan. Success story: Ross Barkley charges down Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo during one of his three senior England appearances this season . Connor Wickham . England's match-winner in the final against Spain, Wickham has finally realised his potential this season in helping Sunderland avoid relegation from the Premier League. His performances for Ipswich Town in the Championship persuaded the Black Cats to shell out £11m for him in the summer of 2011 but he hasn't shown consistent form for them until this year. A loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday, where he scored eight times in 13 appearances, helped set up a storming end to the season in which crucial goals against Manchester City, Chelsea and Cardiff City kept Sunderland in the big time. Great escape: Connor Wickham scored five crucial goals to keep Sunderland in the Premier League . THE REST OF THE SQUAD . Sam Johnstone . Highly-rated Manchester United academy product who has not yet made a first-team appearance but has enjoyed profitable loan spells elsewhere. Oldham, Scunthorpe, Walsall, Yeovil and, most recently, Doncaster have been the goalkeeper's clubs. He was also named in Peter Taylor's squad for the 2013 FIFA Under 20 World Cup. George Thorne . West Bromwich academy graduate who has made a handful of first-team appearances and spent time on loan at Portsmouth, Peterborough United, Watford and Derby County. Brought back to The Hawthorns in the middle of the 2012-2013 season when Steve Clarke was short of players, Thorne impressed in a number of games before a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament ruined his chances of more regular first-team football. Helped Derby reach the Championship Play-off final, scoring in the semi-final, second leg against Brighton. Loan star: George Thorne finds the net for Derby County against Brighton in the Championship Play-off semi-final . Saido Berahino . Striker who enjoyed a breakthrough year at West Bromwich, scoring eight times and playing in 28 matches. Scoring the winning goal at Old Trafford, his first in the Premier League, stood out as a highlight. Before that, loan spells at Northampton, Brentford and Peterborough showed his goalscoring potential. Called up to the England Under 21 team at the start of this season, Berahino has been in fine form, scoring six times in five outings. Back of the net: Saido Berahino celebrates a goal for England Under 21s against Moldova . Robert Hall . Forward who followed up his win with England by signing a first professional contract with West Ham in October 2010. He would make seven first team appearances for the Hammers, gaining most of his experience in loan spells at Oxford United, MK Dons, Birmingham and Bolton. Hall eventually joined the latter of those clubs in July last year and played regularly at the Reebok Stadium in the Championship. Ben Gibson . Middlesbrough defender who has forced his way into the first team this season after useful loan spells at Plymouth Argyle, York City and Tranmere Rovers in recent seasons. Played 20 times for the Teesside club this season and is set for many more. Called up for the Under 21 team for their recent qualifier with Wales. Back in the fold: Ben Gibson (right) in training with England's Under 21 side ahead of the Wales game . Tom Thorpe . Centre-back who is still awaiting a first team opportunity at Manchester United after progressing through their youth and reserve teams. Helped them win the FA Youth Cup in 2011 and the inaugural Under 21 Premier League title in 2013. Spent the second half of this season at Birmingham City alongside Tyler Blackett and Federico Macheda but only made half-a-dozen appearances before suffering ligament damage and returning to Old Trafford for treatment. Has one cap for England Under 21s. Luke Williams . Middlesbrough striker who has made a few appearances for the Riverside club spread over the last five seasons.

Graeme Pullen, 62, was fishing for pollock off the North Devon coast when the 8ft long porbeagle shark took his bait. The experienced fisherman, who caught the epic encounter on camera, wrestled with the shark for more than 30 minutes on Saturday - when nearby beaches would have been full of tourists making the most of the warm weather. Scroll down for video . Graeme Pullen, 62, was fishing for pollock off the North Devon coast at the weekend when the 8ft long porbeagle shark took his bait . The experienced fisherman, who caught the epic encounter on camera, wrestled with the shark for more than 30 minutes over the weekend - when nearby beaches would've been full of tourists . Mr Pullen, from Hook, Hampshire, was on a fishing trip with friend Wayne Comben, when he hooked the porbeagle - which comes from the same family of sharks as the man-eating Great White . The porbeagle - which is believed to be one of the largest sharks single-handedly caught by a fisherman in British waters before - was so big it sent the fisherman’s 17ft fibre-glass boat spinning in circles. The huge fish opened its huge jaws right in front of Mr Pullen, exposing its razor-sharp teeth and even left a bite mark on the side of his vessel. Mr Pullen, from Hook, Hampshire, was on a fishing trip with friend Wayne Comben when he hooked the porbeagle – which comes from the same family of sharks as the man-eating Great White. He refuses to reveal the exact location of the catch for fear of upsetting tourism chiefs, but confirmed it was less than one mile off a popular holiday beach in North Devon. It has been suggested in the past to him that reports of sharks in the seas puts off holidaymakers. If true, the claim bears striking similarities to the classic 1975 movie Jaws in which the mayor of fictional town Amity is terrified the man-eating shark will drive visitors away.

Mr Pullen refuses to reveal the exact location of the catch for fear of upsetting tourism chiefs, but confirmed it was just one mile of a popular holiday beach in North Devon . After hooking the ‘enormous’ porbeagle, he legally tagged the shark’s dorsal fin before releasing it back into the water. Mr Pullen, a keen shark fisherman, said he was surprised to have caught one so early in the season. He said: ‘We were less than a mile off the North Devon coast over a reef that we know doesn’t get hammered by fishermen. ‘Last year was a terrible year for pollock but on this occasion there was a glut of them. We caught 35 of them the day before and went back out again the next day. ‘About two-and-a-half hours into the trip I put on some sun cream and that was when I noticed my float bob about 70ft from the boat. ‘I could feel something chewing on the bait and as it moved off I could feel it was a lot heavier than a pollock. ‘I . thought it was a tope - a smaller member of the shark family - but as I . reeled it closer it grew heavier all the time and after about 40 . seconds I realised it was a big shark. Mr Pullen's rod is visibly bent as he battles the enormous shark which took around 30 minutes to reel in . The huge fish opened its huge jaws right in front of Mr Pullen, exposing its razor-sharp teeth and even left a bite mark on the side of the vessel . After hooking the 'enormous' porbeagle, Mr Pullen legally tagged the shark's dorsal fin before releasing it back into the water . ‘I jokingly said to Wayne “never mind the pollocks” and went into action stations. ‘He started the engine to keep the shark away from the boat while I spent 30 minutes reeling it in and keeping it on the surface. Porbeagles are a member of the same . family as the Great White. They are not considered to be a . threat to humans with only three recorded non-fatal attacks before. Along . with blue sharks, porbeagles are the most common species of shark found . in British waters, but they don’t normally arrive until early summer . when the waters are warmer. They . are found all around the UK, usually at least ten miles offshore, but . sometimes venture closer to shore if prey species are abundant in deeper . waters. Porbeagles can grow up to 12ft long and weigh up to 600lbs. Despite . its size, fearsome teeth and relation to the Great White, porbeagles . are shy creatures and not considered a threat to humans. Some . experts believe porbeagles and blue sharks are migrating to UK waters . because there is not enough food for them in the over-fished Atlantic. The . porbeagle shark - Lamna nasus in Latin - is classed by the . International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered . in the north east Atlantic. ‘It was so big that it was spinning the boat around in circles. 'When it clearly got tired and it was safe to bring it alongside I brought it in. ‘It was an enormous shark and when he swung his head from side to side his jaws opened right up showing his razor sharp teeth. ‘Porbeagles don’t attack humans but you can have a nasty accident with them like you can a chainsaw and it can give a hell of a bite.’ At one stage Mr Pullen was in danger of being dragged into the sea as the strong fishing line wrapped around his hand and he was momentarily attached to it and the shark. Had the shark gone under the surface, the fisherman would have followed it unless he very quickly cut the line. He said: ‘Most shark fishing in this country starts in mid-June so this one was very early. ‘The temperature of the water was 16 degrees and even though it’s only May it is warm enough for sharks to be moving in. ‘This could be a sign of a warm summer to come.’ The big catch comes almost two years to the day that Mr Pullen caught another porbeagle shark in similar waters. On 23 May 2012, he and Mr Comben spent an hour and half trying to reel in their catch - after they hooked a 10ft porbeagle off the coast of Boscastle in North Cornwall. The shark, which weighed 550lbs, dragged the two men and their 17ft-long boat for a mile as they battled to reel it in using a rod and line taken from a garden strimmer. Again, they released the huge fish back into the sea after tagging it but not before it worked itself into a frenzy. At the time, Mr Comben, a 45-year-old water engineer from Havant, Hampshire, said: 'The way the shark just exploded on to the surface gives me goose bumps thinking about it now.'I fought the fish with everything I had and was running on adrenaline by the end of it.'At one point I saw it under the boat and the size of it sent a shiver down my spine.' Experts believe that shark is the biggest ever caught in British Waters. Weighing 550lbs (more than 39 stone), it easily beats the 507lbs record for the previous biggest shark caught off the north Scottish coast in 1993. Graeme Pullen, 62, was left shaking after battling the 8ft long porbeagle shark just one mile off the coast of a popular tourist spot in North Devon . Mr Pullen said: 'It was an enormous shark and when he swung his head from side to side his jaws opened right up showing his razor sharp teeth'","Greame Pullen was fishing off North Devon coast when he caught the shark .

"By . Ian Drury . Legal highs have seen an 'unprecedented expansion' in Britain in recent years - with one in ten people in Britain now admitting they have tried the drugs. New types of the dangerous drugs are being detected at the rate of two a week, a report has found. And the unprecedented rise in the number of potentially toxic new chemicals has left police and drug agencies in the UK struggling to keep up. The unprecedented rise in the number of potentially toxic new chemicals has left police and drug agencies in the UK struggling to keep up. The UK is the only country to control mephedrone (pictured), a former designer drug known as 'meow meow' The new study by the United Nations also shows that the UK is one of the worst-affected countries in Europe. Figures show that 8.2 per cent of Britons questioned in 2011 had taken so-called designer drugs. Only Ireland (16.3 per cent), Poland (9 per cent) and Latvia (8.8 per cent) were worse. And experts warn the problem is likely to have grown because of the rising range of chemical compounds sold. The UN's Global Synthetic Drugs Assessment report said 348 legal highs have been identified across the globe, with 97 new substances detected last year alone - up from 8 new ones a year earlier. Legal highs are designed to imitate the effects of Class A drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy while having enough differences in their chemical make-up to get around existing bans. Many new drugs are created in back-street laboratories in the Far East and are marketed as plant food or bath salts . Many new drugs are created in back-street laboratories in the Far East and are marketed as plant food or bath salts to try to skirt the law. Police cannot stop their sale in shops or at festivals because they are not prohibited. Users of so-called designer drugs were warned that they are playing 'Russian Roulette' with their lives after a huge surge in the number of deaths. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which compiled the report, warned the 'health threat' to those snorting, swallowing or smoking the narcotics - wrongly assumed to be safe because they are not outlawed - was 'growing rapidly'. Doctors and nurses in Britain have been left 'powerless' to treat casualties when they fall ill because they are unable to identify what substances they have taken so cannot provide appropriate medical care. A separate study in February found 97 people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009, meaning the toll has risen eight-fold in three years. Natascha Eichinger, the UNODC's synthetic drugs researcher, said: 'The danger is people are consuming new psychoactive substances without knowing that they're doing so. 'So once these people have severe health issues and they wish to receive treatment they don't actually know what they've taken. It gives treatment centres huge difficulties.' The report added: 'Emergency services may therefore find themselves unable to identify life-threatening substances and powerless to administer the proper treatment to users.' The 76-page study warned that designer drugs are increasingly popular among young people and are no long restricted to 'niche' markets. Angela Me, the organisation's head of analysis, said: 'Twenty years ago, you would have the heroin user, the cocaine user, but more and more people are using a variety of illegal and non-illegal drugs.' Ministers have pledged to update drugs laws to stop unscrupulous chemists dodging bans. The UK is the only country to control mephedrone, a former designer drug known as 'meow meow' which was classified as a class B substance in 2010 after being linked to a spate of deaths. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which compiled the report, warned the 'health threat' to those snorting, swallowing or smoking the narcotics - wrongly assumed to be safe because they are not outlawed - was 'growing rapidly' The government has introduced a temporary banning system to try to keep pace with the influx of new drugs. It allows a 12-month ban on a substance while experts examine its harm and consider whether it should be outlawed permanently. But Ms Me said governments - including Britain - were failing to keep up with the proliferation of legal highs and urged a widening of existing bans. She said: 'There is evidence that when these substances are controlled there is an impact on the number of deaths.' The UNODC said data for the UK suggested controls may have led to a decline in mephedrone use. A survey indicated that annual use of the drug had dropped from 51 per cent in 2010 to 19.5 per cent in 2011 after it became illegal. However, another study conducted at two dance clubs in London found 52 per cent of people had uses mephedrone in the year - second only after cocaine at 59 per cent - indicating it was still popular. Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: 'The coalition Government is determined to clamp down on the reckless trade in what are somewhat inaccurately called ""legal highs"", which has tragically claimed the lives of far too many young people in our country. 'Hundreds of substances previously sold are now controlled drugs in the UK, mainly thanks to our use of generic legislation.'","Police are struggling to keep pace with the potentially toxic new chemicals .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Paul Lambert will bring Darren Bent back in from the cold next season after owner Randy Lerner made it clear the Aston Villa manager must use all players at his disposal. The move represents a remarkable turnaround for the striker who was frozen out at Villa and part of the so-called Bomb Squad training separately from the first-team. Villa tried to offload Bent last summer but could not find any team to match their £8million valuation and in the end agreed a season-long loan move with Fulham, who picked up his £65,000 per week wages. Scroll down for video... Back in the fold: Darren Bent will return to Astonb Villa after being under-used by Paul Lambert . Road to recovery: Charles N'Zogbia is also expected to play a bigger part after being sidelined by injury . He scored six goals in 30 appearances . but was an infrequent starter and displaced towards the end of the . season by 19-year-old Cauley Woodrow. The 30-year-old’s return reflects . the difficulty Lambert will have in making signings during the transfer . window this summer with the club up for sale and uncertainty about the . future. Charles N’Zogbia is . another who should be back in contention for selection after missing the . entirety of last season with an Achilles injury and then failing to get . fit, while Alan Hutton will also return if a buyer cannot be found. Lambert’s . previous tactic was to jettison those players on big wages he felt were . of little benefit to team harmony but Lerner wants to see money he has . spent on the pitch with Bent the prime example. He arrived at Villa for . an initial £18m in January 2011 and still has a year left on his . contract. Given Christian Benteke is out with an Achilles injury . until October at the earliest and Libor Kozak still needing to fully . recover from a broken leg Villa’ s striker situation is critical. Bent . was nicknamed ‘The Mailman’ by Lerner three years ago because he . ‘always delivered’ but the goals dried up and his attitude was . questioned. Lambert said: . ‘Everyone is even now. Everyone is level. That’s what you can do. It’s . publicly known what’s happened and everyone is on a level playing field. The only uncertainty is the main one – how long does it take to get . sold?’ He added: ‘Christian is doing well, we had one of the physios . over there last Tuesday to see how he was.

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . Top football agent Phil Smith has slammed the FA for banning him for six months, describing the punishment as ‘completely out of proportion’. Smith, whose First Artists agency has been one of the leading football businesses for over two decades, has been banned for two years, with 18 months suspended, for third-party  ownership breaches. The FA decision prevents him from working during the transfer window this summer, which  promises to be highly lucrative with Premier League clubs expected to spend a record sum. Not happy: Phil Smith has slammed the FA for banning him for six months for a deal involving Matt Phillips . Smith worked for Wycombe Wanderers in negotiating striker Matt Phillips’ move to Blackpool for £350,000 in 2010, with the selling club wanting to pay him a proportion of their 25 per cent sell-on arrangement rather than a straight agent’s commission. However the FA vetoed Wycombe’s proposal. But when Smith went back to Wycombe after Phillips’ £6million transfer to QPR last August, the club had changed ownership. And instead of recompensing Smith for his original work, the agent was reported to the FA. Smith said: ‘It’s ridiculous that I have been given such a ban when it was Wycombe who wanted to pay me that way. I earned nothing for this assistance, Wycombe earned in excess of £550,000. Yet the FA, in their supposed wisdom, felt I acted beyond the agent’s charter. ‘The FA are happy to apply their heavily over-staffed and hugely unsuccessful compliance department to punish those who try to help our game maximise its assets. I’ve been made a scapegoat for the FA failing to nail any proper third-party transactions involving a lot of money.’ ............................................................................................ The biggest objections to FIFA president Sepp Blatter allocating as much as £16million of Zurich’s money to the film United Passions, a vanity project about the history of football’s world ruling body, are expected to come from UEFA. And certainly the FA will not be impressed with a film that depicts the colonial pre-war rulers of English football as arrogant and out of touch (no change there, then) for refusing to have anything to do with the World Cups in 1930, 1934 and 1938. ............................................................................................ Chelsea have concerns over the way their chairman Bruce Buck has been portrayed during the Richard Scudamore sexist text scandal. Although Buck, a shooting pal of Scudamore, chairs the Premier League’s audit and remuneration committee, only a majority club vote can rule on their beleaguered chief executive’s fate. Yet the misconception demonstrates just why the League must reform their governance to a far more transparent and independent process. Watch: Richard Scudamore will be called to account by the FA to deliver his promises . Sepp Blatter, who is due to announce his candidacy for a fifth term as FIFA president at their congress in Sao Paulo next month, has been widely expected to stand unopposed in the 2015 election. Former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne, the only candidate so far, will certainly withdraw when Blatter becomes a certain runner. However, it’s understood that UEFA will definitely put up a candidate because their president Michel Platini does not want Blatter to be elected unopposed. The Frenchman is unlikely to put himself forward with so much on his plate in Europe. But Platini will search for a credible challenger who wouldn’t be embarrassed by an election defeat. No trouble: Sepp Blatter is widely expected to stand unopposed in the 2015 election . Shame of fans’ boss . The scenes at the end of the EnglandFans FC match against Frickley Athletic will not impress the FA, who had links with their official supporters’ club team before distancing themselves. EnglandFans manager Garford Beck stormed on to the pitch after the 5-5 draw – with Frickley winning on penalties — to confront the referee, calling him a cheat. The official then lunged at Beck before players from both sides rushed to keep them apart. Civil servant Beck said: ‘I was so angry for my players and I had a list of grievances that I wanted to talk to him about. I apologised  afterwards for what I said.’ The FA respect  campaign is obviously alive and well.","Phil Smith has been banned for third-party ownership breaches, but insists he is being used as a scapegoat by the FA .

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . England, with the pain still raw from their winter of absolute discontent, know that the public’s patience will be in short supply if they fail to hit the ground running when they begin their international season in earnest on Tuesday night. They may have safely negotiated an early-season trip to Aberdeen but a Twenty20 international against world champions Sri Lanka at The Kia Oval will provide a much stiffer test of whether England are back on the right track. It was here at this iconic ground last year that England began to lose the warmth of their support, even in the aftermath of a 3-0 Ashes victory, when the arrogance that had crept into their attitude was epitomised by some players urinating on The Oval pitch during their victory celebrations. Stepping up: England stand-in captain Eoin Morgan prepares at Kia Oval for Tuesday's Twenty20 against Sri Lanka . Time to repay: Morgan, filling in for injured Stuart Broad, says England owe fans after a dismal winter . Their world subsequently came crashing down in Australia and it is from somewhere near rock bottom that England will emerge under new management and following a welcome and necessary verbal charm offensive. Eoin Morgan, with leadership aspirations beyond filling in for Stuart Broad, knows England must now regain the faith of a fanbase disillusioned by that Ashes mauling and a World Twenty20 humiliation from Holland. ‘I’ve just heard that this game is a sell-out so it’s great to know the support we have always had is no different now,’ said Morgan. ‘A win would go a long way towards repaying what we owe those fans.’ It will not be easy. Sri Lanka are the most consistent limited-overs team in the world, having contested five of the last seven global finals, and arrived at The Oval this week in far finer fettle than on previous early summer tours. Yet England do not have to look too far back for encouragement as they were the only team to defeat Sri Lanka in that World Twenty20 in Bangladesh. Support: Morgan was impressed that the Oval had sold out for the T20 but knows supporters want results . On a high: England Test skipper Alastair Cook kisses the Ashes urn after a draw at the Oval secured a draw . Turnaround: Australia celebrate their 5-0 whitewash of England after the fifth Test in Sydney in January . It was Alex Hales, with a brilliant unbeaten 116, who rescued England from the depths of nought for two to defeat Sri Lanka that day in Chittagong and Morgan expects conditions to be similar in south London tonight. ‘There was dew in Bangladesh and it could be the same here,’ said Morgan. ‘We can take huge belief from that performance and I think it will be another high-scoring game this time.’ Hales will have a new opening partner in this match after England’s surprising decision to jettison Michael Lumb, with either Ian Bell or Michael  Carberry being given the responsibility of taking advantage of the power-play overs. There will be no Kumar Sangakkara nor Mahela Jayawardene in the Sri Lanka side following their retirement from short-form cricket and England have turned to new assistant Paul Farbrace for advice on those who will turn out instead. Responsibility: Alex Hales will open the batting for England having been the shining light of the grim World T20 . Repeat performance: Morgan is hoping Hales can repeat his 116 heroics from Bangladesh against the champions . ‘He has been key to our preparation,’ said Morgan of the man who left Sri Lanka after that World Twenty20 win over India when he was head-hunted by England. ‘He knows their guys inside out.’ Morgan, England’s key one-day batsman, will have the job of utilising that knowledge as captain while Broad continues to recover from a knee injury. The Irishman will almost certainly be confirmed as  permanent Twenty20 captain later this summer when Broad is expected to stand down. Inside knowledge: Morgan and coach Peter Moores (left) speak with former Sri Lanka mentor Paul Farbrace (right) That could be just the start for captain Morgan who, if he manages to cement a Test place, remains the only viable alternative to Alastair Cook should things go badly for the England skipper this summer. ‘Leadership roles are something I’d want to take on,’ said Morgan. ‘I think my strengths would be to stay calm in high-pressure situations and to make good decisions. I think I have a reasonably good cricket brain, too.’ England will need both Morgan’s brain and his bat if they are going to get that all-important win to set them up for the summer.","England face world champions Sri Lanka on Tuesday night at the Oval .

'It's a tournament I grew up watching as a kid so it's definitely special to me. Apart from the majors, a World Golf Championships or two possibly, I don't see a tournament I would more like to win. 'My form is good, I've been playing well and building some nice momentum. I've had three top 10s in a row, three top fives in my last two and I feel like there's more to squeeze out of my game, too. 'I feel that the next couple weeks I can progress even more and if that translates into wins, that would be fantastic.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A Californian woman who weighs over 650lbs and has been housebound since 2007 has finally caught her first glimpse of life outside four walls again. Bonnie's confinement began when her beloved mother died, after which she refused to leave the house. Paralyzed with grief when her father then died two years later, she hasn't since left her bed and has relied entirely on her 24-year-old daughter Jamesha to exist. But in an intervention stunt pulled off by TV life coach Iyanla Vanzant, a construction crew freed her by cutting a hole through her bedroom wall, and Bonnie was wheeled out into the sunshine on a gurney, as shown in a recent episode of Own network's Iyanla: Fix My Life. Sunlight at last: This is the moment Bonnie (pictured), who had been housebound for seven years, was wheeled out into the fresh air with her daughter and sole caretaker Jamesha, 24, standing by (bottom left) 'Fresh air!' exclaims Bonnie, breaking into wrenching sobs. 'Feel the sun, Miss Bonnie,' returns Iyanla, prompting the overwhelmed woman to open her eyes. Bonnie, who is wearing a new dress for the big reveal, is greeted with a rapturous applause from her collective neighbors, and tears from her daughter and full-time caretaker, Jamesha. Tears: TV life coach Iyanla Vanzant (left) staged the intervention that finally coaxed Bonnie out of the house, after construction workers were forced to cut a hole through her bedroom to release her . Grief: Bonnie's confinement began when her beloved mother died seven years ago, followed by her father two years later - a loss that saw her spiral into a depression and gain an enormous amount of weight . 'I'm sorry everybody, I'm sorry!' Bonnie repeats, near-hysterical. 'No sorry!' Iyanla enthuses. 'Thank you. She says ""Thank you"" everybody.' After an emotional bear hug with her young grandson, in which she can be heard whispering, 'I told you I was going to take you outside', Bonnie is ready to be taken to hospital in an ambulance for a full evaluation. Back indoors again: Bonnie was loaded into an ambulance and taken to hospital following her big reveal, in order to receive a long-overdue medical evaluation . Relief: Bonnie's daughter Jamesha (pictured) has been looking after her bed-bound mother, who can't even walk, full-time for five years . Prisoner: Bonnie (seen in a previous episode of the show) has been on a diet and undergoing physical therapy at a care home since she left her house, where she has lost about 75lbs and stood up for the first time . 'Step one: done!' cheers Iyanla, clutching a box of much-needed tissues and offering Bonnie a high five. Bonnie was admitted to the USC Hospital in California, where she was too heavy for their scales, but was estimated to weigh in at over 650lbs. Last month, she was moved to Pasadena Meadows Nursing Center, where she underwent physical therapy and was placed on a restrictive diet. She has so far lost about 75lbs and for the first time in five years, she was able to stand up. Doctors say she should be walking within a month.","Los Angeles-based Bonnie hasn't left her house in seven years and hasn't got out of bed for five .

"By . Emma Innes . A woman who was told she would have to hang up her running shoes due to a rare neurological condition has found a way to continue training - by running backwards. Laura Cattivera, 46, from California, has focal dystonia, a condition which affects a muscle or group of muscles causing involuntary spasms and abnormal postures. Athletes and musicians are prone to the condition as a result of overusing muscles when carrying out a specific movement. Laura Cattivera, 46, has overcome a rare muscle condition by learning to run backwards . But Ms Cattivera has discovered that if she runs backwards the spasms do not impede her training. ‘I always had a passion for running and nothing could stop me. Not even a rare neurological disease. I have always been a runner,’ Ms Cattivera said. The Californian had a passion for the sport her entire life, and successfully competed on the Princeton track team, even qualifying for the Olympic trials in 1992. But in 1989, she began noticing some physical abnormalities that mysteriously crept up on her while she was sprinting. During the Olympic trials, these strange symptoms caused Ms Cattivera to repeatedly bump into the barrier during the race, and she finished second to last at the event. ‘I use to feel like it's a flutter in my leg at the end of the runs. My leg wasn't moving correctly through running,’ she said. Ms Cattivera has focal dystonia which means she experiences leg spasms if she runs normally . Ms Cattivera's was determined not to give up running so started looking into possible solutions . ‘I went to a million different types of doctors. I had a MRI, a CT scan, orthopaedics and so on.’ As the condition progressed, Ms Cattivera found the focal dystonia caused her left leg to move involuntarily and spasmodically to one side, preventing her from running in a straight line. ‘If I don't stop running, my left knee is facing out and my foot is landing outside the sole of the shoe,’ she said. Focal dystonia can be treated with Botox injections, which prevents the symptoms by paralysing the affected muscle, but in Ms Cattivera’s case, the affected muscles are too deep to isolate. She also tried drugs for Parkinson's disease to banish her symptoms - but their effectiveness would wear off over time. Ms Cattivera and her doctor discovered she can still run backwards as it uses different motions . Ms Cattivera is now even organising a backwards running competition in California . Determined not to give up running, Ms Cattivera tried experimenting with new ways of running, initially moving in a zigzag pattern. But it wasn't until she met Dr Nicholas Szumski that she hit upon her ingenious backwards technique. She said: ‘I went to a million types of doctors and by Dr Nicholas Szumski I was suggested to run backwards. So I tried it and it gave me something that was really working and was a new adventure.’ Dr Szumski added: ‘Dystonia is often associated very much with one repeated motion over and over. So coming up with a way that doesn't use that motion may give you a way around it.’ Ms Cattivera now runs with a smile along on the sand around Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach, and has even teamed up with Dr Szumski to organise a backwards running race in Manhattan Beach to raise awareness of focal dystonia in runners. Dystonia is a disorder which causes involuntary muscle contracts and abnormal postures. The movements may be painful and some patients also have a tremor. There are several different forms of dystonia - including focal dystonia, which just affects one part of the body. Dystonia is a disorder which causes involuntary muscle contracts and abnormal postures - focal dystonia affects just one part of the body . Focal dystonia often only affects one specific action while allowing others to occur unimpeded. For example, a musician may have dystonia when using her hand to play an instrument, but not when using the same hand to write. In some cases, the condition becomes progressively worse while in others it is stable. It is not known exactly what causes dystonia - many cases do not have any clear cause. However, it is thought it can be triggered by a defective gene or by certain medications. Dystonia can develop at any age and there are currently no medications that can prevent or cure it. In some cases, Botox injections can help by preventing the muscle contractions.

"By . Emma Innes . A young woman diagnosed with terminal cancer after hospital staff failed to spot abnormalities in a routine cervical smear test has criticised the  ‘appalling mistakes’ made by the NHS. Fay Harryman, 29, from Chatham, Kent, went for a routine cervical smear in April 2009. The . test was analysed at University Hospital Lewisham and she was told . there were no abnormalities and should attend another routine smear test . 36 months later. However, within months she started suffering from bladder problems and abnormal bleeding. Fay Harryman (pictured with her boyfriend) developed cervical cancer symptoms just months after being told the results of her routine smear test were normal. Further tests revealed a large tumour on her cervix . Shockingly, she had an MRI scan in November 2010 which showed a large tumour on her cervix. As a result, she had to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy which left her infertile. But the treatment failed to stop the spread of the disease and she has now . been told that it has spread to her lymph nodes and is incurable. As a result, she is now undergoing treatment to prolong her life. She said: ‘It’s very hard not to be bitter or angry as I now know that if my smear test had been correctly interpreted in 2009, the last five years would have been very different and I would probably have a future to look to now. ‘There have been numerous campaigns in my lifetime about the importance of attending regular smear tests and how early detection saves lives. When you follow these guidelines, you expect the NHS to correctly play its part in keeping you safe, but sadly my care fell well short of this. ‘Nothing can turn back the clock, but I feel that I deserve to know why it was possible for my smear test to be interpreted incorrectly and it would give me some small peace of mind to know that lessons have been learned throughout the NHS to prevent anyone else having to go through the same unnecessary nightmare as me.’ Ms Harryman had chemotherapy and radiotherapy which left her infertile but the cancer returned and spread to her lymph nodes meaning it was no longer curable . She said: ‘To be told at the age of 25 . that cancer treatment has left you infertile is devastating enough, but . to now be told treatment can only prolong my life rather than cure me is . almost impossible to comprehend. ‘I had always wanted children but the first course of treatment led to me suffering a premature menopause. Cervical cancer is a rare type of cancer that develops in a woman's cervix. It often has no symptoms in the early stages meaning it is often not diagnosed until it is more advanced. Symptoms that can develop include unusual vaginal bleeding which can occur after sex, in between periods or after the menopause, and pain during sex. When the cancer is more advanced, symptoms can include constipation, blood in the urine, loss of bladder control, back pain, loss of appetite and weight loss. Screening (which is offered to all women aged 25 to 64 in the UK) aims to pick up abnormal cells before they turn cancerous. These pre-cancerous cells can normally be treated to prevent them becoming cancerous. Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papillomavirus, which can be spread through sex. Since 2008, an HPV vaccine has been routinely offered to all girls aged between 12 and 13. Of all the women diagnosed with cervical cancer, 83 per cent will survive for a year and 67 per cent will survive for at least five years. Source: NHS Choices . ‘My boyfriend Mike and I then planned to have children via a surrogacy route in America but I was rejected for funding on the NHS and now my cancer has returned it is not something I can continue to pursue. ‘My boyfriend and family have been amazing and I want to thank them for all the support they have provided.’ Ms Harryman has now instructed lawyers  to investigate whether more could have been done to detect and treat her cancer sooner. The firm is also investigating whether earlier detection would have saved her life. Expert evidence commissioned by the lawyers found that Lewisham Healthcare NHS Trust failed to detect abnormal cells in the smear test taken in April 2009, incorrectly reported the smear as ‘normal’ and recommended a standard recall in 36 months (three years). The evidence also suggests that, had the test been correctly reported as showing abnormalities, further testing would have been recommended within four weeks which, on the balance of probabilities, would have confirmed cancerous cells and meant Ms Harryman could have been sent for immediate treatment to remove them, preventing the cancer from spreading. The Trust has admitted liability for the failure to detect and report the cancerous cells, but continues to dispute how the failures contributed to the cancer returning and whether it would have saved her life. Ms Harryman’s legal team has now issued court proceedings in the hope of quickly securing her a vital settlement to fund her ongoing treatment costs and cover her loss of earnings. Ms Harryman believes that if the smear test results had been accurate, she would now have a future . Victoria Walne, her lawyer at the firm Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘This is a tragic case - Fay is not yet 30 but has been left with terminal cervical cancer and unable to have children. ‘While the Trust has admitted liability for its failings relating to interpreting and reporting the smear results, we believe it also needs to give answers about how it was possible for these failures to happen and confirm what steps have been taken to ensure the same, frankly appalling mistakes, can never happen again. ‘We hope the Trust will now work with us to provide this information to Fay but also quickly agree a settlement that will fund her ongoing care costs and cover her loss of earnings as she is unable to return to her previous job.’ A spokesperson of Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust said: ‘We are extremely sorry for the failure to detect abnormal cells following Fay Harryman’s smear test in 2009. ‘Whilst our processes for analysing and reporting smears met national guidelines, we did review them and have made improvements. ‘This includes ensuring that we carry out additional reviews of smear tests when necessary. ‘As legal proceedings are ongoing, we cannot comment further at this time.’","Fay Harryman had a routine cervical smear test in April 2009 .

"By . Lizzie Parry . The father of a severely ill newborn baby has launched a desperate appeal to save his son's life and bring him home from China for treatment. When tiny Constantine Martland was born on May 5 his parents Michael, 30 and Cath were told their son had the rare heart condition, Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome. The illness means only the left side of Constantine's heart can function and he will require a three-step operation to survive. Mr Martland, who moved to Beijing in 2007 to work as a teacher, said immediately after his son was born he was taken away from the couple as Chinese policy dictated he needed to be cared for in isolation. Tiny Constantine Martland was born in China on May 5. Within hours of his birth his parents Michael and Cath were told he had the rare condition Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome . On the second day of his short life, Mr and Mrs Martland were told their baby son had just 24 hours to live, because the Chinese hospital did not have the resources necessary to care for Constantine. The distraught couple discharged their son and upgraded him to the Western-style Anzhen Hospital, with the help of Mr Martland's friend and boss Daphne Hutagalung. There doctors said Constantine could survive but he faces very risky surgery when he is a month old. The procedure, to implant a BT shunt, aims to restart the left side of Constantine's heart. If successful, the tiny baby could be deemed well enough to fly back to the UK for his second operation. But the couple have used up their life savings on hospital fees in China, and are now launching a desperate appeal to raise money to continue funding Constantine's treatment. 'We still need to raise more so Constantine can have the first operation so he can return safely to the UK for the second and third step operations,' said Mr Martland. 'For the first few months, Constantine will be isolated as he cannot risk to be infected, therefore we will not be able to see him for that length of time. 'During the first few days of understanding our child’s condition, my wife and I were going through a range of emotions. 'I wrote a log to vent feelings and also to keep a record of everything that we’d experience so far for future reference.' Constantine is currently in a stable condition, with doctors predicting he has a good chance of surviving the risky first procedure. His parents have launched a desperate bid to raise money to pay for his first operation and after care in China and to fund bringing him back to the UK where he will need another two operations . Mr Martland, who is originally from Wigan, Greater Manchester, added: 'With Constantine stable enough we contacted Helen Walker from the Alder Hey hospital who was extremely understanding with our situation. 'We had an idea to fly Constantine from . Beijing to Liverpool using the SOS International Group but as it turns . out that because of the severity of his condition and lack of prior . insurance we could not afford to fly him out with the medical . assistance. Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome is a very rare condition which causes the right side of the heart to be underdeveloped at birth. It results in the chambers, valves and blood vessels of the right side of the heart being malformed. These malformations include a very small right ventricle and a small pulmonary artery. The malformation means the heart is not able to pump blood efficiently to the lungs causing low blood oxygen levels. Symptoms of the condition normally develop almost immediately after a baby is born. Affected babies often take on a bluish tint - particularly to their skin, lips and fingernails. Treatment options include open-heart surgery and a heart transplant. Source: Congenital Heart Defects UK . 'So at least the first operation must be performed here in Beijing, and it’s usually common for a child to be in the hospital for four months average before they are discharged. 'Our life savings, which were meant to be used for a return to the UK, have been spent in a matter of days. 'That is why we are asking for help and donations for Constantine and other children who need similar help when insurers find it difficult to provide for them. 'We would like the readers to be aware all extra money that is donated after we reach our goal will be re-donated to other children heart foundations in the UK and China so they can also provide care that is needed during a heart wrenching time.' A target of £15,000 has been set and a third of that has been raised so far. Mr Martland added: 'It is difficult for us but at the same time, we find this a painful yet small price to pay for a chance at life for our boy. 'Constantine would not be where he is without the help of people like Daphne, the team at Jia De Montessori Kindergarten (JDM) and the parents who helped us with donations, Dr Jayne Ziermann and all the staff at Oasis Hospital, Dr Helen Walker and Alder Hey and Dr Chen at Anzhen hospital.'

"By . Lizzie Parry . For nine years, Lucy Phasey longed to become pregnant. Told she could not conceive naturally because her immune system was waging war on her fertility, the 27-year-old turned to IVF. Four times doctors implanted embryos into Mrs Phasey's womb, and four times the procedure failed as her body killed off the 'foreign bodies'. In the face of their infertility, it was . a rare treatment involving egg yolks being injected into Mrs Phasey's . body, to suppress the 'natural killer cells' in her system, that . helped the couple realise their dream of becoming parents. For eight years Lucy Phasey longed to fall pregnant, but doctors told her she would never conceive naturally because her immune system interpreted any embryos as a foreign body, killing them off. But in February the 27-year-old gave birth to Evie Ray, after four failed rounds of IVF . Mrs Phasey and her husband Liam, also 27, endured three failed rounds of IVF and one miscarriage and had almost given up hope of becoming parents when they heard about a rare treatment which could help. Their gorgeous daughter was born on February 7 . The treatment involved Mrs Phasey being injected with egg yolk and soya bean oil to suppress the killer cells in Mrs Phasey's system that were attacking the embryos . Seven years after being told she . might never become a mother, Mrs Phasey and her husband Liam, also 27, welcomed tiny Evie Ray into the world in February. After enduring four failed IVF attempts - including one miscarriage - the couple were told they would have to opt for private care if they wanted more answers. Baffled doctors were unable to diagnose the problem but Mr and Mrs Phasey could not stretch their finances to meet the cost, resigning themselves to never having their own children. Distraught, Mrs Phasey told her husband to move on and find another wife who could give him the child he so desperately wanted. A year later, the couple heard about a rare treatment, giving them a glimmer of hope. The procedure involved Mrs Phasey having egg yolk and soya bean oil injected into her system through an IV drip. And on February 7, the couple welcomed Evie Ray into the world at Wrexham Maelor Hospital. 'I have five nieces and nephews and I honestly thought I would never go through that myself,” said Mrs Phasey, from Dolgellau, North Wales. Mr and Mrs Phasey were first told they would never conceive naturally in 2007, after being together for a year . Eighteen months later they started their rounds of IVF from October 2009 to April 2012, three failing and a fourth resulting in a miscarriage . The pair then stumbled across CARE, an infertility treatment centre in Manchester, where a doctor told them Mrs Phasey's immune system was too strong, killing off embryos because it thought they were a foreign body . The treatment is given to suppress natural killer (NK) cells in a woman's body, the theory being that some women’s bodies are non-baby-friendly and their immune system attacks the embryo as if it were a foreign body. Intralipids — a mix of soya-bean oil, egg yolk, glycerine and water — are a fat emulsion used as a source of calories and essential fatty acids for post-operative patients and premature babies requiring nutrition into their bloodstream. They have also been found to have an immuno-suppressant effect. The theory is that the intralipids have a stabilising effect on cell membranes, which makes it harder for the killer cells to attack and go on to cause implantation failure and miscarriage. The fats are highly calorific — about 200 calories a dose, the equivalent of a Snickers bar — and have been likened to ‘getting an armful of mayonnaise’. Administered via a drip usually twice before conception, and then three more times after, the treatment is thought to help the embryo implant and grow normally. Alongside this, women are also recommended to take steroids, which further suppress the immune system, and blood thinners to prevent blood clots, which also can impede embryos implanting. 'It has just made our whole family, on both sides, complete. It is an amazing feeling, she is such a wanted baby. 'She’s 14 weeks old now and I’m still in a bubble, I have to keep pinching myself and think ""is this really me, am I a mum?"" 'I’m still calling myself Auntie to her by default because I still don’t believe she is my daughter, I have to remind myself I’m her mum.' The first blow for the couple came in 2007, when after being together for a year and a half, they were told they would never be able to conceive a child naturally. After 18 months of 'filling out forms' and having further tests, they started IVF treatment at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital. They went through four attempts, between October 2009 and April 2012, on the NHS, but each failed, and despite scrimping and saving they were unable to afford any more. The pair then stumbled across CARE, an infertility treatment centre in Manchester, where a doctor told them Mrs Phasey’s immune system was too strong, killing off embryos because it thought they were a foreign body. The 27-year-old was given intravenous intralipid therapy, a treatment administered through an IV drip and made from soya bean oil, egg yolk, glycerin and water. The therapy stimulates the immune system to suppress so-called 'natural killer cells' and allow an embryo to implant in the womb.

After just months, Mrs Phasey became pregnant when an embryo was implanted in her womb in April 2013. 'It was a very nerve-wracking morning for us and the family,' she said. 'We both held onto the hope that this would be the one. I could tell when they put it in there, I could see she was a fighter and would be the one, I just sort of knew. 'I did feel a bit weird knowing what was being put inside of me but after years of non-natural methods I was definitely on board with the more natural way. 'She’s 14 weeks old and I’m still in a bubble, I have to keep pinching myself and think ""is this really me, am I a mum""?' - Lucy Phasey . 'I just kept taking tests, we took the positive one at 5.05am before Liam went to work and we were just ecstatic, I woke all my family up to tell them! 'It was such a contrast to before, I had tried to tell Liam to go off and have a baby with someone else because I felt I couldn’t make him happy, and now we were looking at our own baby, after nine years. 'He didn’t believe he was going to be a daddy until she was placed in his arms really, he kept avoiding the subject until he knew she was real, it was an incredible moment.' The couple have yet to decide if they will try for more children, but are enjoying the realisation of their eight-year dream with the birth of Evie Ray. Mrs Phasey said: 'We wouldn’t want to experience the heartache again, but we have stored embryos for three years so perhaps it will be an option. 'But we’ll never be disappointed because Evie is here and we have what we wanted.'","Lucy and Liam Phasey discovered they could not conceive in 2007 .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . George Simpson has been embroiled in an escalating row with staff over the treatment of his frail mother Morag, 85 (pictured) A man has been banned from visiting his elderly mother in hospital after repeatedly complaining about the care she is receiving. George Simpson, 62, has been embroiled in an escalating row with staff over the treatment of his frail mother Morag, 85. He says he has repeatedly complained about the standard of care and conditions at Edinburgh's Ferryfield House hospital. Hospital chiefs have now imposed a two-week ban claiming he was upsetting staff who are 'unable to carry out their jobs without fear or intimidation'. Mr Simpson said: 'I am frantic with worry about my mother. She’s not much longer for this planet and I’m having to put up with this garbage. 'I go up and feed her and she doesn’t eat when I’m not there as the staff don’t have the time to sit with her. 'She’s down to six stone and doesn’t have weight to lose. I have no axe to grind with them. 'They are not telling the truth, and making these accusations because they are not doing their jobs properly.' 'What they’re trying to do is discredit me so they can cover up their own shortcomings. It’s absolutely disgusting.' He added that only a fortnight ago, a nurse reported he 'deliberately veered towards her in the corridor in a threatening manner'. Hospital bosses said the visiting rights 'suspension' was a consequence of strained relations which stopped staff from doing their job properly. The drastic action follows six recorded incidents since May 2013 when staff perceived Mr Simpson's behaviour as aggressive. In a letter to Mr Simpson, Tim . Montgomery, Interim General Manager of the Edinburgh Community Health .

Mr Simpson says he repeatedly complained about the standard of care and conditions at the Edinburgh community Ferryfield House hospital . He said: 'While I do understand that you want to ensure that your mother is cared for safely and appropriately and following the assault on her last year, are very anxious about her wellbeing, I believe that our staff are compromised in their care for your mother whilst you exhibit these aggressive behaviours - and these need to stop.'

In a statement, Mr Montgomery added: 'We cannot tolerate any form of aggression or intimidation towards any of our staff and it is regrettable that after all other attempts have failed, we have had to take this very unusual step. 'Our workforce rightly expects to be able to deliver healthcare in an environment free from fear. Some members of staff on the premises have become frightened for their safety following a number of recent incidents and that is unacceptable. 'We discussed with Police Scotland how best to handle this situation, but unfortunately we have been left with no other option. The system will be in place for two weeks and will then be subject to review. 'We will provide regular telephone updates and other relatives who continue to visit will do the same.'

"By . Emma Glanfield . A heartbroken husband who thought he’d watched his wife of 41 years die after switching off her life support machine found out three days later she was still alive. Doctors at Sandwell General Hospital, in West Bromwich, West Midlands, told Malcolm Greenhill it would take just a few minutes for his 65-year-old wife Marilyn to pass away so he said his goodbyes before leaving her bedside. The 62-year-old then returned home to inform their children and the rest of the family of his wife's death, after she suffered a bleed to the brain when falling down the stairs of the couple’s home in West Bromwich on May 3. Malcolm Greenhill, 62, thought he had watched his wife Marilyn, 65, die after he made the decision to turn off the machines which were keeping her alive at Sandwell General Hospital in West Bromwich (pictured) However, when he phoned the hospital three days later to make arrangements for her body to be released for burial he was shockingly told she was still alive and breathing on her own. The family rushed back to the hospital and stayed at her bedside until she died at 7pm on May 7. Mr Greenhill told an inquest into her death how he had to watch his wife ‘die twice’ because of the blunder. Giving evidence at Smethwick Coroners Court he said he would never have left his wife’s side for her remaining four days if he had known she was still alive. He said: ‘I was told it was only the machine keeping her breathing and there was no point prolonging the inevitable. ‘They told us there was nothing more they could do and she would only live for a couple of minutes once I turned the machine off so I said my goodbyes. ‘It is like grieving for her dying twice, I said goodbye twice. ‘If I knew she would stay alive for four days I would never have left her side.’ Doctors at Sandwell Hospital, in West Bromwich (pictured) told Mr Greenhill his wife would pass away within minutes of life support being switched off on May 3. But he found out she was still alive three days later . The grandmother was hospitalised after her husband discovered her lifeless body at the bottom of the stairs of the couple's home after she fell on May 3. She was taken to hospital but doctors said nothing could be done to save her life and Mr Greenhill made the heart-breaking decision to turn off the life support keeping her alive at 6pm on the same day. The couple’s daughter, Joanne Highfield, 39, told the hearing: ‘We didn’t know that for three days she had laid there alone, she was still breathing. ‘If I knew she would stay alive for four days I would never have left her side.’ - Malcolm Greenhill . ‘Nobody called us, no one told us our mum was still alive.’ The pair’s son Craig, 41, said the blunder only emerged after staff at Sandwell General Hospital couldn't find Marilyn's body in the mortuary. He said: ‘Dad turned her machine off on Saturday Bank Holiday and we were told to call back on Tuesday but when we spoke to the mortuary at the hospital they told us they couldn't find her. ‘It turned out she was still on the ward.’ Assistant Black Country Coroner Mr Angus Smillie adjourned the inquest into her death for three months, describing the incident as a ‘fairly extraordinary turn of events’. He said: ‘It is an unexpected turn of events, you went home thinking she had passed away only to find out days later that she was in fact still alive. ‘It would be inappropriate of me to conclude the inquest today because of the unusual circumstances. ‘I would like to adjourn for three months for more medical information and for an investigation into exactly what happened in those intervening days. ‘It is a fairly extraordinary turn of events.’ Mrs Greenhill died on May 7 but, giving evidence at Smethwick Coroners Court (pictured), her husband said he would never have left her side for her remaining four days if he had known she was still alive . A spokesman for Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs Sandwell General Hospital, said the death was being thoroughly investigated. Sam Holdsworth, communications support officer, said: ‘Our condolences go out to Mrs Greenhill’s family at this difficult time. ‘Deaths in our trust are thoroughly investigated. ‘Should the coroner request that we examine any specific concerns arising from the ongoing inquest then we are committed to providing information rapidly and fully.’ Darren Cooper, leader of Sandwell Council, said there had been a ‘massive breakdown in communication’ between the family and hospital and called for a full investigation. He said: ‘My thoughts go to the family. It’s a shocking set of circumstances. ‘There appears to have been a massive breakdown in communication between the hospital team and the family. ‘I hope that that there is a full investigation into what has happened because something has gone seriously wrong and it needs looking into.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Marilyn Greenhill, 65, was hospitalised after falling down the stairs on May 3 .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . In the near future, airlines could share tracking data and get free access to a range of cutting-edge technologies to prevent any more planes being lost without a trace. These are two of the suggestions made by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) at an event in Montreal this week, set up in the wake of the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia flight MH370 in March. It follows separate plans from London-based Inmarsat to offer free flight tracking to thousands of commercial passenger planes. Experts gathered in Montreal this week to discuss a worldwide framework for tracking flights. Proposals include airlines being able to share data, and preventing tracking tools from being disabled. It was organised in the wake of the MH370 disaster in March when a Malaysia Airlines plane, stock image pictured, went missing . Speaking at the event, the ICAO said global flight tracking is now so vital, it has set a deadline for the processes to be in place by September. On . board a plane there are cockpit voice and flight data recorders – the . ‘black boxes’ – which each include a ‘pinger’ that sends a transmission . up to 30 days after submersion underwater. In . the black box is an ASD-B flight transponder which, unlike the GPS in a . car, broadcasts its location by sending information back to air traffic . controllers every second. Crews are also able to speak to their airline through discrete radio channels. The . cockpit voice recorders can additionally reveal conversations and other . sounds to hint at problems that may have occurred during the flight. Officials from 40 countries gathered for the ICAO summit to discuss a range of tracking options. The organisation will now take this framework of worldwide standards and decide which solutions to put into place. During the summit, members were presented with a number of flight tracking technologies and protocols for tracking planes. One includes preventing anyone from being able to disable the flight tracking systems on all planes, while another suggested a global database so tracking data can be shared more easily. It is likely the organisation will choose a variety of tools and technologies to widen the scope of searches, rather than getting all airlines to subscribe to the same one. Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, president of the ICAO said: 'This systems-based approach acknowledges that what will best service airlines and manufacturers over the longer term will be the flexibility to choose from amongst the latest and most cost-effective innovations that meet their global flight tracking needs.' The United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), stock image pictured, said global airline flight tracking is now so vital, it has set a deadline for proposals to be in place by September. It is likely the organisation will choose a variety of technologies to widen the scope of searches . Inmarsat's technology, pictured, helped reveal the last position of missing flight MH370 in March, and now the London-based firm is offering free tracking to 11,000 commercial passenger planes. In addition to free tracking, the company is also offering a 'black box in the cloud' that will store historic and real-time flight data . 'As ICAO considers the requirements . for global flight tracking, we will also be looking closely at the most . effective means of sharing tracking data when needed with applicable . search and rescue and accident investigation authorities.' Satellite firm Inmarsat announced its plans to track flights for free last week, as a direct response to the missing plane. In . addition, the firm will also provide a ‘position reporting’ tool in . case flights veer off track, and a so-called ‘black box in the cloud’ to . track real-time data remotely. This remote black box is triggered automatically if the plane deviates off course, or communication is lost. and also sends historic recordings to a team of experts.

Inmarsat, said: 'Inmarsat . has been providing global aviation safety services for over 20 years . and we are confident that the proposals we have presented to ICAO and .

The firm claims the service will cover 'virtually 100 per cent of the world's long haul commercial fleet' ‘In the wake of the loss of MH370, we believe this is simply the right thing to do. ‘Because of the universal nature of existing Inmarsat aviation services, our proposals can be implemented right away on all ocean-going commercial aircraft using equipment that is already installed.' Flight MH370 vanished on 8 March with 239 people on board, during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Evidence revealed on 15 March by the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak suggested the jet was deliberately diverted by someone on board. Five days later, Australian search teams announced they were investigating two objects spotted on satellite images in the southern Indian Ocean. On 24 March, Razak said analysis of satellite data - by Inmarsat - confirmed the plane went down in the Indian Ocean. More debris was spotted on 28 March. The latest update, at the start of last month, claimed to have detected ultrasonic signals from the plane's black box. Two months on, the plane has still not been found.","Experts gathered in Montreal this week to discuss global tracking options .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Rumours that Facebook is working on a branded handset have been around since 2010, and now new patent images have added fuel to this fire. The patent was originally filed in 2011 by a lead Facebook engineer and features a traditional touchscreen, with a touchpad on the side. An alternative image shows this touchpad on the rear of the device, with a clickable button on the side instead - both of which could be used to recognise certain gestures. The patent was originally filed in 2011 by a lead Facebook engineer. It details a traditional touchscreen, with a touchpad on the side, pictured, that would use a 'gesture recognition library' to respond to certain movements. An alternative image shows this touchpad on the rear of the device, with a clickable button on the side instead . The latest patent was discovered by Patent Bolt, but it is not the first to hint towards plans of a Facebook device. In . 2011, the site filed a patent called Mobile Device with Concave Shaped . Back Side, which was a precursor to the current curved phones, including . the LG G Flex and the Samsung Round. The initial reports of a Facebook phone were posted in a TechCrunch report in September 2010. It . claimed a source with ‘knowledge of the project’ had told the site . Facebook was building the software for a phone, while a third party was . building the hardware. According to the files, the touchpads and buttons would respond to finger movements using a ‘gesture recognition library.’ As the application, called Navigating Applications Using Side-Mounted Touchpad, explained:  ‘A user taps or strikes lightly on touchpad, and a gesture recognition library can interpret the user's touch input and identify the touch input corresponding to a tap event.’ For example, flicking up on the pad could post a Facebook status, while flicking down could be used to send a message. A flow diagram in the patent also describes how a series of taps could be used to access photos, specific friends or news feed content. Although a number of the images show Facebook screens, the patent doesn’t explicitly claim the gestures would only control Facebook options.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Turning bad parents into good parents is often the work of social workers, teachers or even a number of TV chat show hosts. But research from Harvard University suggests there might be an easier option. The scientists claim to have found a ‘switch’ in the brain of male mice that can turn troublesome fathers into doting dads. Research from Harvard University has shown that the level of aggressiveness shown by adult mice to pups can be altered by destroying groups of neurons in their brains. This suggests there is a switch that decides how nurturing mammals will be to younglings . The study, published in the journal Nature, was led by Catherine Dulac, a professor of molecular and cell biology at Harvard University. The research focuses on a group of neurons in the brains of mice that have been linked to paternal care. By shining a light to trigger specific brain cells, the scientists were able to change the approach to parenting of male mice. There are, of course, obvious difference between human parenting and mice parenting. Notably in the former there are a host of complexities involved including social and cultural experiences. Nonetheless, at a basic level the researchers say the study provides some key insight into how the brain works with regards to parenting. ‘The fact that we are mammals means we certainly have those neurons as well,’ Dulac told the Boston Globe. And she says while the study only focused on male mice it could just as easily be applied to females. Indeed, she says that the finding that males and females share this key brain circuit suggests dads have the same potential to be as nurturing as mums. True . monogamy is rare in the animal kingdom - even in species that appear to . mate for life, tests have revealed cheating is commonplace. However, . a new study by the University of Pennsylvania has found Azara's owl . monkeys buck this trend because they are ‘unusually faithful.’ The . investigation of 35 offspring born to 17 owl monkey pairs turned up no . evidence of cheating, and the male and female monkeys that cared for the . young were the infants' true biological parents. An . additional analysis of 15 pair-living mammals found a strong connection . between a species' faithfulness and how much of a role the males took . in caring for their young. Although the research was only carried out in mice, the scientists say the results could also be applied to humans and other mammals. However, as human brains are much more complex it would be much harder to replicate the results in people . In the research they focused on species of mice where the males were known to attack the children of others. But they would cease the aggressive behaviour when their own pups were due, three weeks after mating with a female. The researchers searched the brain for the neurons that might be responsible for this change in behaviour and focused on a region known for sensing pheromones. These scents influence the behaviour of other animals, and was thought to be important in mating. By destroying brain cells in that region, the aggressive nature of virgin male mice was found to drastically decrease. Instead of attacking young pups, they would nurture them and even build them nests. Conversely, when they destroyed nerve cells in the middle of the brain in female mice, they made the mothers act more aggressively.","Study into mice brains reveals a group of neurons that control parenting .

"By . Emma Innes . A mother-of-two is recovering after becoming paralysed during a Zumba class. Kelly Hindson, 32, was taking part in her regular exercise class when her legs suddenly stopped working. Ms Hindson, from Birmingham, West Midlands, was horrified as her lower body slowly became paralysed, and she was unable to use her legs or feet. Kelly Hindson, 32, suddenly lost the ability to use her legs and was paralysed during a Zumba class . But remarkably, a year after her ordeal began, she is finally on the road to recovery. She said: ‘I was in my Zumba class last July when the instructor asked us to run on the spot and I just couldn’t do it. ‘I couldn’t move my legs properly and I just had no idea what was wrong. ‘I told my friend and she joked that I was being lazy, but I could tell that there was something seriously wrong. ‘As a swimming teacher I’m usually really active and I went to Zumba at least twice a week, so it was really worrying. ‘As time went on I couldn’t move my legs and feet were completely numb - I was basically paralysed from the waist down.’ In hospital, Ms Hindson was diagnosed with a rare condition which occurs when the immune system starts to attack the nerves causing them to become inflamed . Ms Hindson was released from hospital after two weeks and it was thought she had recovered but she soon developed symptoms again and had to return to hospital with partial paralysis . After continuously experiencing the strange symptoms, Ms Hindson was eventually diagnosed with a rare condition called Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Guillain-Barré syndrome (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements. Guillain-Barre syndrome (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements. It affects about 1,500 people in the UK every year and is slightly more common in men than women. It causes the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed. Symptoms include a tingly, numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement. Most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection a few weeks before. Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage.

Most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection a few weeks before. Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have lasting problems. Ms Hindson said: ‘At A&E the doctors began to test my reflexes and I didn’t have any - that was a clear sign that I had GBS. ‘As soon as they told me I rang my mum - she was really worried because she knew someone that had it before. ‘The doctors explained to me what it was in a roundabout way, but it was only when I looked at some information myself that I really understood the full extent of the condition. ‘I was horrified - I’d never heard of GBS before and all of sudden I was reading that I could become completely paralysed, it was really scary. ‘I was told they would start me on some treatments but as the condition progressed I couldn’t walk or put any pressure on my legs. ‘Luckily after about 12 days I was back on my feet again, but I knew something still wasn’t right.’ Unfortunately, after contracting GBS, Ms Hindson went on to develop an extremely rare form of the condition known as chronic inflammatory axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP). When Ms Hindson's symptoms returned, she was found to have an extremely rare and more serious form of Guillain-Barré syndrome. she is pictured with her daughters . Ms Hindson spent months experiencing bouts of partial paralysis and, nearly a year on, still requires crutches to get around. This is because she still has numbness in her legs and feet as well as balance problems . Ms Hindson said: ‘Two weeks after I left hospital - supposedly recovered - I was back in again. ‘All my symptoms were back again, and they seemed even worse. ‘At first doctors thought I just wasn’t handling my symptoms properly, but finally after even more tests and investigations, I was diagnosed with the CIAP form of the condition at the end of last year. ‘This form of the condition affects the inner nerves, where as normal GBS affects the outer - the type I have is considered to be more serious. ‘It was a relief to get the diagnosis but I felt so unlucky - most people just get GBS and eventually recover, but I had to be the one to get this. ‘It affects only about one or two people in every six million.’ Ms Hindson (pictured in hospital) still does not know if she will ever make a full recovery . Ms Hindson spent the next few months in and out of hospital experiencing bouts of paralysis and constant problems with tingling and numbness. She went through phases of being paralysed from the waist down and struggled to get around because of numbness and problems with her balance. But remarkably, after suffering from the condition for almost a year, she is starting to show signs of recovery. She said: ‘I underwent a lot of treatment, and I’m now on my feet again, but I do still need crutches. ‘I have been taking aloe vera supplements which I think have played a big part in my recovery as it gives me more energy. ‘I could potentially stop progressing at any point, so it’s quite scary, but I just have to stay positive and take everything day by day. Ms Hindson said:  'I underwent a lot of treatment, and I'm now on my feet again, but I do still need crutches' ‘My balance is still quite poor, but I just have to keep going. ‘I’m back at work as a swimming teacher so I stay active, and I have two little girls that that keep me busy. ‘Although my GBS journey has been a long and complicated one, doctors believe the symptoms have finally slowed, and my life should finally be getting back to normal.’ Caroline Morrice, director of the Gain Charity which provides support for people with GBS, said: ‘Guillain-Barré syndrome is an uncommon illness that causes weakness and a loss of sensitivity, affecting about 1,500 people in the UK a year. ‘It will start with a tingling or loss of feeling in the toes and fingers and progresses from there. Ms Hindson said: 'I could potentially stop progressing at any point, so it's quite scary, but I just have to stay positive and take everything day by day' ‘In a worst case scenario it can cause total paralysis, and about 10 per cent of people will die as a result of it. ‘A similar amount of people will be left with very severe residual effects, but the majority of people make a full recovery. ‘There is no known cause for GBS, although we often find people who suffer from it may have just had a stomach bug or some kind of infection. ‘Chronic inflammatory axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP) is a very rare type of GBS which affects the inner nerves - it is a condition that usually affects Chinese people, so Kelly’s case is unusual. ‘If we eventually find the cause of GBS, we hope that we could find a cure.’","Kelly Hindson suddenly couldn't use her legs during an exercise class .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Human evolution is surging as a result of improvements to healthcare and larger populations. That's according to Dr Briana Pobiner, an anthropologist at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, who believes we are seeing a rapid rate of progress. But while evolution is moving quickly, Dr Pobiner warned waterborne and airborne illnesses could also spread more easily as a result. Human evolution is speeding up as a result of better healthcare, larger populations and our ever developing brains, according to Dr Briana Pobiner, an anthropologist at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. Stock image pictured . As well as brain development, human evolution persists in other areas too, such as sexual selection. The changes of men's beard fashions, for instance, may be guided by Darwinian selection, according to a recent study.

When a . ‘peak beard’ situation is reached, evolution favours those with beards - . a trend we may be witnessing now, University of New South Wales researchers claim. ‘I invite you to look into the eyes of our ancient relatives,’ Dr Pobiner said. ‘Why did most human ancestors go extinct, while homo sapiens survived? The answer has a lot to do with human brains.’ The largest evolutionary changes have occurred in the neocortex, the area responsible for processing abstract thinking, long-term planning, empathy and language, according to Live Science. But while we may be evolving rapidly and spreading further around the globe, humans are also at risk of deadly parasites. This, Dr Pobiner claims, is due to rising . sea levels and less land available, along with concerns over frozen . parasites being revived on Earth.

The more beards there are, the less attractive they become - giving men without beards a competitive advantage, scientists in Sydney found earlier this year . For example, the smallpox virus was eradicated in 1979, according to the World Health Organisation, but some experts claim it has only been eradicated from the Earth’s surface, surviving instead in frozen form.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A devastating 'impact winter', brought on by an asteroid strike 66 million years ago, is being blamed for wiping out the dinosaurs. Researchers have discovered the first physical evidence that global temperatures suddenly plummeted following the impact off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Its effects would have been identical to those seen in the aftermath of a large-scale nuclear war, including the chilling effect of dust blotting out of the sun. Research suggests a devastating 'impact winter' wiped out the dinosaurs after a six-mile-wide (10km) asteroid slammed into the Earth 66 million years ago. The study is the first to provide physical evidence for the sudden plunge in global temperatures that followed the impact off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Illustration pictured .

The effect may have been made worse by heat-absorbing soot from burning organic matter, said the researchers. The . 'dark phase' would have temporarily suppressed the photosynthesis of . green plants and algae, causing a 'global collapse of terrestrial and . marine food webs'. According . to the models, the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface . might have been reduced to around 20 per cent of its normal level after the . impact. According to the research, the 'Chicxulub' impact is likely to have brought about this 'nuclear winter' by lowering global sea surface temperatures by as much as 7°C (45°F) at a conservative estimate. For creatures evolved to live in a lush, warm, green world, the result would have been catastrophic. The 'winter' is thought to have lasted no more than two to three decades, but that was long enough to wipe out the dinosaurs, flying and swimming reptiles, and many other forms of life. Only the most adaptable survived, leading to the reign of the birds and mammals that continues to this day. The evidence comes from the Brazos River region of Texas, where sedimentary rocks the same age as the asteroid impact contain layers of broken shells. They are thought to have been left there by a tsunami triggered when the massive space rock plunged into the ocean. Unusually high concentrations of iridium produced as the asteroid vapourised were also found in the sediments. An idea of post-impact sea surface temperatures was obtained by analysing fatty molecules from marine organisms preserved in these rocks. According to the study, the 'Chicxulub' impact is likely to have lowered global sea surface temperatures by as much as 7°C (45°F) at a conservative estimate. For creatures evolved to live in a lush, warm, green world, the result would have been catastrophic . These had a different signature before and after the event, also known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary impact. They . indicated a significant temperature drop compared with the period just . before the asteroid struck, with some samples suggesting a fall of up to . 7°C (45°F). Scientists recently reconstructed one of . the biggest asteroid impacts ever to hit Earth - and claim it was six . times as big as the blast than wiped out the dinosaurs. A huge asteroid is believed to have hit Earth 3.26 billion years . ago, creating unique geological features found in a South African region . known as the Barberton greenstone belt. Researcher said the impact would have boiled oceans, burned the sky, and cause the planet to shake for 30 minutes. The . huge impactor - between 23 and 36 miles (37 and 58km) wide - . collided with the planet at 12 miles (20km) per second. The . jolt, bigger than a 10.8 magnitude earthquake, propelled seismic waves . hundreds of kilometers through the Earth, breaking rocks and setting off . other large earthquakes. Tsunamis . thousands of metres deep - far bigger than recent tsunamis generated by . earthquakes - swept across the oceans that covered most of the Earth at . that time. The . scientists, led by Dr Johan Vellekoop, from Utrecht University in the . Netherlands, wrote in the journal Proceedings Of The National Academy Of . Sciences: 'The global impact winter, characterised by darkness and a . dramatic cooling of ocean surface waters, perturbed a relatively stable, . warm, latest Cretaceous climate and likely represented a major stress . factor for life on Earth.' Computer simulations suggest a hellish environment in the first hours after the impact marked by earthquakes, tsunamis and global wildfires sparked by an intense heat pulse. Next, dust and sulphur droplets would have collected in the atmosphere and blocked out the sun's rays. The effect may have been made worse by heat-absorbing soot from burning organic matter, said the researchers. The 'dark phase' would have temporarily suppressed the photosynthesis of green plants and algae, causing a 'global collapse of terrestrial and marine food webs'. According to the models, the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface might have been reduced to around 20% of its normal level after the impact. The contrast between still-warm oceans and cold air would have fuelled large storms and hurricanes, whipping up more dust and increasing the time it spent in the atmosphere. Ocean life might also have been affected by the acidification of seawater caused by a fall-out of sulphurous particles raining down from the sky. The researchers concluded: 'The K-Pg boundary impact presents a unique event in Earth history because it caused global change at an unparalleled rate. This detailed portrayal of the environmental consequences of the K-Pg impact and aftermath aids in our understanding of truly rapid climate change.'","Study suggests a 'nuclear winter' followed the dinosaur extinction event .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Steve McClaren has revealed how he once gave Louis Van Gaal a bouquet of flowers ahead of a match as a tactic to win a vital three points and clinch Champions League football for FC Twente. Van Gaal had guided AZ Alkmaar to the Eredivisie title in 2009 when he travelled to play McClaren’s side at the start of May. Twente needed a victory to secure second place ahead of Ajax and McClaren reckoned that lavishing the famously fierce Dutchman and his team with praise might soften them up ahead of the encounter. The 'tulips trick' seemed to work as Twente won 3-0 and finished one point better off then Ajax. Familiar: Derby County manager Steve McClaren has come across Louis van Gaal in Holland and Germany . Successful: Van Gaal has won titles with AZ Alkmaar in the Eredivisie and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga . ‘I’ve come across him many times and remember every game,’ McClaren said of the new Manchester United manager. ‘He’s actually the only man I’ve given flowers to. ‘He was with AZ while I was with Twente, they were first and we were second and they had won the league the previous week with two or three games to go. ‘We had to win the game to finish second. We thought, he’s won the league - we'll shower him with all good wishes and try and get him in a nicer mood and his team a little more relaxed than normal. ‘So we gave a procession, congratulated them on winning the championship and in Holland you don't get bottles of champagne, you get flowers. Every time you win something, retire, they give you a bunch of flowers. So I gave Louis a bunch of flowers. We won 3-0. That got us into the Champions League.’ McClaren also gave Van Gaal credit for the modern day Bayern Munich. The Derby County boss added: ‘He's great. I came across him in Germany with Bayern Munich and the way they are playing now – he started it. ‘He’s a very good coach, very good manager, knows what he wants. He's done it at every club - Manchester United is the perfect fit for him.’ Architect: McClaren says Van Gaal laid the foundations for Bayern Munich's success .","Derby manager has faced Van Gaal on touchline in Holland and Germany .

No summer series of TOWIE would be complete without a trip to the party-loving city of Marbella, or 'Marbs' as the people of Essex, and the resort's biggest fans, like to call it. Fans are hoping for sun, sea, sand and serious amounts of drama on the Costa del Sol coastline and the cast are living by the mantra 'No carbs . before Marbs' as they prepare their bodies and wardrobes for some serious poolside posing. Cast member Bobby Cole Norris, however, has taken preparation for the overseas trip one step further by spending two days in London's Stansted airport conquering his fear of flying. 'TOWIE elite: Bobby Cole Norris joined Joey Essex, Sam Faiers, Jessica Wright and Ricky Rayment for filming in Marbella last year . The 24-year-old hairdresser has hated flying since a child. And rather than looking forward to a few fun-filled weeks away with his Essex gang, and planning how many pairs of sunglasses to take, he has spent weeks worrying about the flight. He said: 'The beach outfits are planned, sunglasses collection ready to be showcased and the tan applied but having to fly has always put a dark cloud over the whole holiday. 'Sitting at the airport gate I have always been the one looking nervously out on the runway biting my nails. For me it’s the noises. I sit there listening to every bang and whirling, thinking it’s a signal that we are doomed to drop out of the sky any minute!' All calm: Bobby pictured on the test  flight with his Fear Of Flying Instructors . Bobby's not alone, it is estimated that one in six people are scared of flying. But the former party-planner, and show's resident GBF, has managed to conquer his fear for good with an intensive two-day course. The £189 Fear Of Flying course held by easyJet consists of a three-hour ground session presented by phobia expert Lawrence Leyton, star of Channel 4’s Fear of Flying programme and senior easyJet pilot, Captain Chris Foster. They teach participants a set of mind . techniques as well as explaining what every noise, bang and whirling . sound is at every stage of a flight. The following day, participants are taken on a test flight to put the skills they have learnt to the test. Success: Bobby tweeted a picture of his easyJet certificate saying: 'All ready for Marbs. Thank you.' Following the course Bobby said: 'I feel so E-mosh! I can honestly say that this course has changed my life. 'Waking . up the morning after the ground session I felt completely different; I . didn’t feel sick or anxious and was looking forward to the flight – . something which I haven’t ever done.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A group of retired NFL players filed a lawsuit on Tuesday in which they say that the league, thirsty for profits, illegally supplied them with risky narcotics and other painkillers that numbed their injuries for games and led to medical complications down the road. The league obtained and administered the drugs illegally, without prescriptions and without warning players of their potential side effects, to speed the return of injured players to the field and maximize profits, the lawsuit alleges. Players say they were never told about broken legs and ankles and instead were fed pills to mask the pain. Scroll down for video . 'I became a junkie in the NFL' Former NFL player J.D. Hill says he was provided uppers, downers, and painkillers while playing for seven years in the 1970s . One player says that instead of surgery, he was given anti-inflammatories and skipped practices so he could play in money-making games. And others say that after years of free pills from the NFL, they retired from the league addicted to the painkillers. The complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, and a copy was shared with The Associated Press ahead of the filing. The lawsuit comes on the heels of a landmark case that accused the league of concealing known risks from players' concussions. The NFL settled that case for $765 million last year. No blame was assessed and players received no punitive damages. The drug lawsuit names eight players, including three members of the NFL champion 1985 Chicago Bears: Hall of Fame defensive end Richard Dent, offensive lineman Keith Van Horne, and quarterback Jim McMahon. Eight players are named in the lawsuit, including three members of the NFL champion 1985 Chicago Bears including quarterback Jim McMahon, No. 9 pictured, defensive lineman Richard Dent and offensive lineman Keith Van Horne . Former offensive lineman Jeremy Newberry describes lining up in the San Francisco 49ers' locker room with other players to receive powerful anti-inflammatory injections in their buttocks shortly before kickoff . Lawyers seek class-action status, and they say in the filing that more than 500 other former players have signed on to the lawsuit. McMahon says in the lawsuit that he suffered a broken neck and ankle during his career but rather than sitting out, he received medications and was pushed back on to the field. Team doctors and trainers never told him about the injuries, according to the lawsuit. McMahon also became addicted to painkillers, at one point taking more than 100 Percocet pills per month, even in the offseason, the lawsuit says. Team-employed doctors and trainers illegally administered the drugs, the lawsuit alleges, because they didn't get prescriptions, keep records or explain side effects. Van Horne played an entire season on a broken leg and wasn't told about the injury for five years, 'during which time he was fed a constant diet of pills to deal with the pain,' the lawsuit says. Three members of the NFL champion 1985 Chicago Bears team are named in the lawsuit including quarterback Jim McMahon, wearing headband, who is pictured with President Barack Obama in 2011 . Among the eight named plaintiffs, six were also plaintiffs in concussion-related litigation, including McMahon and Van Horne. The latest lawsuit seeks an injunction creating an NFL-funded testing and monitoring program to help prevent addiction and injuries and disabilities related to the use of painkillers. It also seeks unspecified financial damages. ‘The NFL knew of the debilitating effects of these drugs on all of its players and callously ignored the players' long-term health in its obsession to return them to play,’ Steven Silverman, attorney for the players, said. His Baltimore firm, Silverman, Thompson, Slutkin and White, also represents former National Hockey League players in a concussion-related lawsuit. Former offensive lineman Jeremy Newberry describes lining up in the San Francisco 49ers' locker room with other players to receive powerful anti-inflammatory injections in their buttocks shortly before kickoff. Hall of Fame defensive end Richard Dent, pictured in 2011, is another ex-player named in Tuesday's lawsuit that accuses the league of obtaining and administering drugs without warning players of the potential side effects . Newberry played for San Francisco from 1998-2006, including one season in which played in every game but never practiced because of pain from his injuries, according to the lawsuit. He retired in 2009, and because of the drugs he took while playing, he now suffers from renal failure, high blood pressure and violent headaches, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit seeks class-action status for any former players who received narcotic painkillers, anti-inflammatories, local anesthetics, sleeping aids or other drugs without prescription, independent diagnosis, or warning about side effects or the dangers from mixing with other drugs. ‘I was provided uppers, downers, painkillers, you name it while in the NFL,’ plaintiff J.D. Hill, who played for seven years in the 1970s, said in a statement. ‘I became addicted and turned to the streets after my career and was homeless. Never took a drug in my life, and I became a junkie in the NFL.’","Lawsuit accuses the league of administering the drugs illegally, without prescriptions and without warning players of potential side effects .

'That’s absolutely fine in the right environment, but we try very hard to be a family-focused business and not everybody is a fan of bare chests. 'We simply want to make sure that Adventure Island maintains its status as the best place to bring the whole family for a fun, safe, reasonably-priced great day out.' Have some decorum: Marc Miller, managing director, has instructed signs to be posted around the park . Signs are now being put up around the park and security staff will politely challenge individuals who have removed their tops and ask them to put them back on again. Those who refuse will be asked to leave. Mr Miller added: 'Of course, we don’t want people to think we’re introducing a nightclub-style policy of no jeans or trainers. There definitely won’t be Adventure Island fashion police criticising people for wearing double denim combinations, spots with stripes or inappropriate shades of purple.

Worried locals initially sparked a radiation alert after calling police to report the bright glowing lights at a bathing beach in the city of Qingdao in eastern China's Shandong province. Firemen however were quickly able to . reassure locals that the blue glow was entirely natural, and caused by . tiny animals known as sea sparkle, or noctiluca scintillans to give it . its Latin name. Lighting up the night: A large section of coastline in Qingdao city, Shandong province, eastern China, has been glowing with bright blue light . Pictures taken of the eerie glowing blue lights were uploaded to the internet and quickly spread on local social media networks, sparking more curious onlookers to head to the region to see it for themselves. The tiny microscopic animal feeds on plankton sized creatures and when disturbed they generate light via a chemical reaction. Fire brigade spokesman Meng Chiu said: 'Anything that disturbs them causes the chemical reaction which can be yellow or green, or blue or even red depending on which type of sea sparkle it is. Close-up: The blue glow is caused by tiny animals called noctiluca scintilians which generate light through a chemical reaction when they are disturbed . 'Obviously been washed up against the beach counts as disturbing these tiny creatures, and as a result they had started to illuminate themselves.' Little is known about why the creatures have developed the unusual reaction to disturbances and what the ecological advantage might be. Normally the animals spend their time living just below the surface of the water and are most active at night. Those pictured in the water in Qingdao would have to number in the billions to generate such a bright light.

The results place the capital on an equal footing with Paris which also has three museums - the Louvre, The Centre Pompidou and the Musée d’Orsay - in the top 10. It comes after the British Museum reclaimed its title as the second most popular cultural institution after a two-year absence by overtaking New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. With more than 6.7 million visitors last year, the British museum saw a 20 per cent rise on 2012. Second most popular: The British Museum has reclaimed its place as the second most visited museum in the world with 6.7 million attendees in 2013 .

On display: A 37-metre long-ship is part of the Viking Exhibition at the British Museum . Still number one: The Louvre in Paris has been the most visited museum in the world for six years running. Last year alone it had 9.3 million visitors . It now comes just behind the Louvre in Paris, which attracts 9.3 million attendees every year, making it the most popular museum in the world. It has claimed the top spot for attendance figures for six years in a row. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has now dropped back down into third place, despite visitor numbers rising to 6.2 million.

But the Tate Modern saw a drop in visitors with just 4.8 million visitors in 2013 compared to 5.3 million in 2012, although it still managed to come sixth in the list. The Art Newspaper suggests the decline is possibly down to the closure of the Tanks to allow its extension to be completed and the end of the Unilever series in the Turbine Hall. Meanwhile, deputy editor Javier Pes put the British Museum's increased popularity down to its exhibitions - particularly the Life And Death In Pompeii And Herculaneum show. It is currently hosting a Viking exhibition complete with 37-metre longship and has placed the Saxon treasures of Sutton Hoo on centre stage in its newly refurbished medieval gallery. Others to feature in the list include the Vatican Museums in fifth place, the National Palace Museum in Taipei in seventh, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC in eighth place.

"By . Associated Press . A police officer, a paramedic, a rabbi, a nurse and a Boy Scout leader were among 71 people arrested in the New York City area in recent weeks as part of a sweeping investigation into the anonymous trading of child porn over the Internet. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which led a five-week investigation, known as Operation Caireen, ending last week, planned to announce Wednesday that it resulted in charges against at 70 men and one woman. Officials call it one of the largest local roundups ever of individual consumers of child porn, and a stark reminder that they come from all segments of society. Consuming child porn 'is not something that is just done by unemployed drifters who live in their parent's basement,' said James Hayes, ICE's New York office. 'If this operation does anything, it puts the lie to the belief that the people who do this are not productive members of society.'

Advances in technology and computer . capacity have allowed child-porn collectors to more easily amass vast . troves of images and to exchange files with each other directly, . authorities say. The cyber dragnet resulted in the seizure of nearly 600 . desktop and laptop computers, tablets, smartphones and other devices . containing a total of 175 terabytes of storage. Agents . are still examining the devices to locate and catalog evidence — an . arduous task that could result in more arrests. The National Center for . Missing and Exploited Children also will use its analysts to review the . images to see if it can identify children using databases of known . victims. 'We refer to each . of these images as a crime scene photo because that's exactly what they . are,' said John Ryan, the organization's chief executive officer. Mount Pleasant, New York  police Chief Brian Fanelli and his wife Sonja exit Federal Court in White Plains in January after he was arrested on child porn charges. A five-week investigation has resulted in charges against at least 70 men and one woman in the New York City area in what officials called one of the largest-ever roundups locally of people who anonymously trade child porn over the Internet . Authorities decided to launch the operation after the arrest in January of a former police chief in suburban Mount Pleasant, Brian Fanelli, who pleaded not guilty this week to federal charges of knowingly receiving and distributing child pornography. Court papers allege that Fanelli told investigators he began looking at child porn as research before it grew into a 'personal interest.' Authorities say some of the defendants had access to young children, though there were no reports of abuse. The Boy Scout leader also coached a youth baseball team. The rabbi home-schooled his children and others. Another person had hidden cameras used to secretly film his children's friends. One defendant was already on bail following his arrest last year on charges he used the Internet to direct women to record sex acts with young children. Court papers allege he 'indicated the last video he had downloaded and viewed depicted a mother sexually abusing her 3- or 4-year-old child.'","Arrests culminated a five-week investigation that ended last week .

"By . James Rush . For Nicholas Brody, the star of hit U.S. TV show Homeland, the half-finished Tower of David in Venezuela was both a prison and a refuge. On the run as a wanted Al Qaeda terrorist, the shaven-headed Brody, played by the English actor Damian Lewis, got sucked into a world of gun-wielding thugs and drug abuse. But for the people who live there in real-life the tower made famous by the TV show is their home. Standing 45 storeys tall, complete with helicopter landing pad and glorious views of the Avila mountain range, it was built with the intention of becoming a shining new financial centre in Venezuela's capital. Since it was abandoned roughly 20 years ago, amid a massive run on the country's banking sector and the death of its developer, this incomplete skyscraper has been transformed into what has been described as the tallest slum in the world. The building was seized by squatters in 2007, when then-President Hugo Chavez's socialist government turned a blind eye, and now about 3,000 people call it their home. Scroll down for video . Standing tall: The incomplete skyscraper, dubbed the Tower of David, stands 45 storeys tall in the city of Caracas, Venezuela . The shaven-headed Nicholas Brody, played by the English actor Damian Lewis, got sucked into a world of gun-wielding thugs and drug abuse in the third series of Homeland . Home: Adriana Gutierrez and her son Carlos Adrian watch TV as they sit on their bed in their 24th floor apartment inside the skyscraper . Salvage operation: Men rest after salvaging metal on the 30th floor of the 'Tower of David' skyscraper in Caracas in February . Incomplete: Children stand along the corridors of the skyscraper, which was intended to be a shining new financial centre but ended up being abandoned in 1994 . Yet while many residents of Caracas view the skyscraper as a den of thieves and a symbol of disrespect for property, residents see it as a safe haven from the city's crime-ridden slums. 'There is far more order and far less crime in here than out there,' 27th-floor resident Thais Ruiz, 36, told Reuters. Like many inhabitants, Ruiz abandoned her shack in the violent Petare slum of east Caracas in 2010 to build a spacious four-bedroom apartment in the tower where she lives with her husband and five children. The family at first lived in a tent in a space initially intended to be a fancy corner office with a vista, but over the years they hauled bricks, furniture, water tanks and even barbecue equipment up the 27 flights of stairs to build their home. 'I never lived in an apartment before. We're so comfortable now,' she says. 'We had to get out of Petare and the daily gang shootouts. Once we found a dead body on our doorstep. Now look, we can leave the door wide open.' The building does seem to have escaped the violence and turf warfare that has followed similar building takeovers in the city over the last ten years. Occupied: Children ride bicycles on one of the top inhabited floors of the 'Tower of David' skyscraper in Caracas. Squatters seized the building in 2007 . Safe haven: Men salvage metal on the 30th floor of the abandoned skyscraper in Caracas. Residents see the building as a safe haven from the city's slums . Tallest slum in the world: Work was sufficiently advanced by the time the tower was abandoned for the first 28 floors to be habitable . Security: Families pay a 200 bolivar ($32) monthly 'condominium' fee, which helps fund 24-hour security patrols . Working out: Gabriel Rivas, 30, lifts weights on a balcony on the 28th floor of the Caracas skyscraper. The building has featured in an episode of U.S. TV drama Homeland . Communal corridors are freshly-polished, rules and rotas are posted everywhere, and non-compliance is punished with extra 'social work' decided by a cooperative and floor delegates who make up a mini-government. Work was sufficiently advanced by the time the tower was abandoned for the first 28 floors to be habitable, though the squatters have had to brick up dangerous open spaces, and put in their own basic plumbing, electrical and water systems. Families pay a 200 bolivar ($32) monthly 'condominium' fee, which helps fund 24-hour security patrols. Yet few deny the conditions can still be precarious. One young girl fell to her death through a hole in the wall a few years ago, while a drunk motorcyclist rode off an edge and killed himself. Leaving for work: A man, who is on his way to work, walks through the lobby of the 'Tower of David' skyscraper in Caracas . Business: A woman looks out of a window of her shop in a corridor inside the skyscraper. The building does seem to have escaped the violence and turf warfare that has followed similar building takeovers in the city over the last ten year . Living conditions: Thais Ruiz, 36, talks on the telephone and drinks coffee as she sits under a crack in the roof of her living room on the 27th floor of the skyscraper . At work: Maria works in a sewing workshop in her apartment inside the tower. Residents acknowledge the tower had problems with crime but insist miscreants have been kicked out over the last 18 months, and that a new leadership is keeping the house in order . The building has been dubbed the 'Tower of David' in honour of its developer - financier and horse-breeder David Brillembourg. It has also featured in an episode of U.S. TV drama Homeland, while doocumentaries annd analyses of the tower have been shown at art festivals around the world. The tower however is not without its problems - neighboours in the area surrounding the tower have complained of robberies, ATM hold-ups, and drug trafficking taking place under the noses of authorities. Residents acknowledge the tower has had problems with crime but insist miscreants have been kicked out over the last 18 months, and that a new leadership is keeping the house in order. 'Everyone thinks we're a bunch of . thieves and thugs in here. We are not ""invaders"", we're occupants of an . empty space,' argues another resident, Luis Raul Pinto, 63. The former government employee drives a taxi by day before clambering up to his roomy apartment every evening. Rules: Communal corridors inside the building are freshly-polished, rules and rotas are posted everywhere, and non-compliance is punished with extra 'social work' decided by a cooperative and floor delegates who make up a mini-government . Leaving: Paola Medina, 29, packs as she prepare to leave her apartment after living in the 'Tower of David' skyscraper for almost a year . Residents: A girl rides a bicycle on a balcony in the 'Tower of David'. Though the tower could be viewed as an indictment of his housing policy, inhabitants appear fiercely 'Chavista' 'Sometimes, I'm driving customers and they look up at the tower and tut ""Look at those criminals in there"". When I drop them off, I tell them ""Hey, I live in the Tower of David, I'm not a criminal, come and have a coffee with me some time"".' Though the tower could be viewed as an indictment of his housing policy, inhabitants appear fiercely 'Chavista'. Posters of Chavez, under the phrase 'Eternal Commander', adorn walls. Some have photos of him by their beds. The former president, who died last year of cancer, spoke affectionately of the tower's residents several times. 'Chavez's legacy is the values you see right here in this tower,' said Nicolas Alvarez, a 38-year-old filmmaker who first entered the tower to give photography courses. He ended up moving in after getting married and struggling to find a home. 'What Chavez did was to rescue the sense that we all have the same right to live on this planet.'","Half-finished building was made famous when it was used as a set in the third series of U.S. drama Homeland .

"By . Ruth Styles . The USA might be public enemy number one to the North Korean government, but that hasn't stopped the people there adopting some of the America's most enduring capitalist symbols, from Mickey Mouse to Coca-Cola. Photographer Eric Lafforgue, who has since been banned from visiting the Communist rogue state, travelled widely in North Korea before being ejected. There, he was given the rare opportunity to talk to locals about their world view. From talk . of 'American imperialists' to the aggressively anti-American education . system, the North Korean view of the West is one controlled by the . government, in a country where the people lack free access to . information. Many insisted to Lafforgue that Mickey Mouse - plastered over children's lunchboxes - is . Chinese, and Coca-Cola, known as Crabonated Cocoa, is a local . invention. 'Even in the official paintings made by State artists, you . see Disney characters that came via the Chinese products that are . everywhere in North Korea,' reveals Lafforgue. 'Most of the people . ignore the meaning.' Scroll down for video . Coke . break: Guide: 'This is our carbonated Cocoa made in North Korea.' North . Koreans say 'crabonated Cocoa' aka Coca-Cola is is local invention . Did you notice that man? He’s wearing an American cap! Guide: 'It's not an American cap Mr Eric -  it's a Chinese one.' Disney, North Korea style: Do you know the name of this character on the fan? Guide: 'No Mr Eric. It's just a mouse. It’s Chinese!' What do U.S tourists say after visiting the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum? Guide: 'They ask for forgiveness for all the crimes that their country has done.' In Hamhung, North Korea's second largest city: Will a man be sent to prison if he steals a bicycle? Guide: 'We don't have terrorism like in the USA in North Korea.' Not impressed: I have read on an American website that the people in the subway are actors... Guide: 'They talk nonsense Mr Eric. I hate Americans!' 'But Americans can visit the country, although they can only enter or exit the country by plane and cannot spend more than 10 days there.' Once there, visitors from the US will find themselves shadowed by official guides. 'The guides know that there are . drugs, crime, unemployment and strikes in the USA, so whenever they can, they like . to tell you that in North Korea, they don't have these kinds of . problems.' More sinister are the posters exhorting people to shoot Americans - an attitude that even extends to the education system. 'It is exciting to play soldier and kill Americans', reads the slogan on one poster photographed by Lafforgue. Asked why they put it in a school, his guide replied: 'Americans have teased us for a long time. That’s why we always give an anti-American education to our kids.' Update: Do you hear news from the rest of the world? Guide: Of course Mr. Eric! We even hear American news. For example, I know Americans have walked on the Moon' Financial advice: Was North Korea affected by the economic crisis? Guide: 'Not all Mr Eric: we’re not capitalists like Americans!' In the demilitarised zone: Why are no US or South Korean soldiers on the other side of the border? North Korean colonel: 'It's 12.30 - the Americans are having lunch!' Later that day: 'Today you can see the American soldiers with their puppets, Mr Eric!' Their puppets? 'Yes, the South Korean soldiers, this is what we call them.' Defensive: What are those blocks on the highway for? Guide: 'In case of invasion by the Americans and their puppets. They are designed to fall on the road to block them.' Unsurprisingly, many children, especially in rural areas, react with fear to the sight of a foreign face. 'I asked my guide why children ran away when they saw me and she told me that because I have short hair, they thought I was an American parachutist,' says Lafforgue. Others blame 'US imperialists' for everything from food shortages to power blackouts. 'I was in a Pyongyang art gallery one day and the power went off,' remembers Lafforgue. 'I asked if it happened every day and the guy in there said: ""Yes. That is the American imperialists fault!""' Asked by Lafforgue why he doesn't like Americans, one local repied: 'They meddle in everything Mr. Eric! Nobody likes them! The whole world is against them: Castro, El Assad, Than Shwe, Ahmadineja, everyone! And Guantanamo!' Others like to enjoy a chuckle at the expense of American tourists.'Yes, they can come here,' one local student told Lafforgue. 'But we only allow them to stay for three days and we make them pay a lot of money!' Paranoid: Guide: 'Mr Eric, you speak too much to this American tourist...' What¿s the problem? 'We think she is a fox.' A fox? 'A spy.' Tourism: American tourists come to North Korea? Guide: We only allow them to stay for three days, and we make them pay a lot of money!' Not amused: Is there any American you admire, an athlete, a politician, an artist? North Korean student: 'Nobody Mr Eric!' Bleak: Do you have homelessness in North Korea? Guide: 'No, here is not like America, Mr. Eric. Our system is much more developed' On the road: It’s a Hummer! It's an American car! Guide: 'Yes Mr.Eric. In Pyongyang we have two.' But this car consumes 20 litres for every 100 km! 'Well that’s not good.' The board says: 'It is exciting to play soldier and kill Americans'. Why? 'Americans have teased us a long time. That's why we give an anti-American education to our kids. Despite the jibes, Lafforgue says that Americans are made to feel welcome by local people who evidently don't share the regime's dim view of the US and its South Korean ally. 'I met many American tourists during my six trips and most of them were surprised by how welcome they were made to feel by the guides and the local people,' says Lafforgue. 'The reality is far from the aggressive propaganda stuff that you can read in the official statements made by the regime. The tourists are allowed to go everywhere apart from the Chilbo area, where everyone else can go and can sleep in the homes of North Korean farming families by the sea. 'Of course, there was no explanation given - they just told me, ""it's not possible!""' Early education: The murals decorating a wall on a school in Pyongyang: the American is symbolised by the wolf killed by the North Korean soldier . Power cut: Local man: 'Well Mr Eric, there is an electricity cut.' It happens every day? 'Yes..That’s the American imperialists' fault.' Smoking: Guide: 'Mr Eric, the soldier is asking you if you have a cigarette?' I only have American ones! 'It is not a problem.' Ludicrous: One of the more ridiculous statements made to Lafforgue was: 'Look there Mr Eric! That dog acts like Americans: it lies down in front of North Korea!' Fright: . ' Why do the children run away when they see me? Guide: 'As you have . short hair, they think you’re an American parachutist Mr Eric.' Police state: There are a lot of policemen in Pyongyang... Guide: 'Yes, the city is very safe, you can go out at night, and will not be attacked like in America.' Empty: Shop owner: 'There is everything in our shops. The Americans tell lies when they talk about shortages.' No one is here. 'It is not the right time; people are working.' Pyongyang fun fair: What do the people shoot at? Guide: 'At targets that symbolise American GIs!' And what’s written on them? 'Kill the US imperialists' Aggressive: While on board the USS Pueblo, captured by the regime in 1968, Eric asked: Who are the enemies of North Korea? Female soldier: 'First is the USA, for sure!'","According to the North Koreans, Mickey Mouse is Chinese while Coca-Cola is a local drink .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Chelsea Clinton's mother-in-law has been earning a six-figure salary from her role heading a charity intended to help women in political campaigns abroad. Marjorie Margolies, the mother of Chelsea's husband Marc Mezvinsky, is a Democrat currently running for Congress in Pennsylvania and the financial statements for her charity, Women's Campaign International (WCI), have come under scrutiny as such. As the charity has grown over the past decade, so has her salary as The Huffington Post reports it has steadily increased from $54,962 in 2002 to the highest point in 2011 when she took home $164,159. Connections: Marjorie Margolies, a former Congresswoman who is currently running to get back into politics, presented her daughter-in-law Chelsea Clinton with an award last month on behalf of her charity . Her salary dipped last year- to $109,678 in 2012- and she has not taken any salary this year. Instead, the former Congresswoman, who served one term before being voted out in 1995, has turned her attention back to the political arena as she is now actively campaigning in her own tight race against three other Democrats. That isn't to say that she has cut ties to the charity, as she regularly posts updates on her Twitter account, publicizing events that they are holding. One such recent evening came in November when she honored her famous daughter-in-law at the 15th anniversary bash for the charity. 'Thrilled to be honored last night by Women's Campaign International & even more grateful for the work they do around the world,' Chelsea wrote to her Twitter followers. That work includes programs focused on conflict mitigation, economic empowerment and political participation in Sri Lanka, Liberia and Malawi respectively. Like many charities, fundraising efforts for WCI ebb and flow along the lines of economic prosperity, meaning that the annual budget for the charity is variable year to year. Back in the race: Marjorie Margolies, the mother of Chelsea Clinton's husband Marc Mezvinsky, is running for a seat in Congress to represent a district of Philadelphia . That helps explain some of the spikes and dips in Ms Margolies' salary, but The Huffington Post points to the fact that even in their more economically-prosperous years, her take-home pay would have been a slightly higher than average percentage of the group's expenses than standard throughout the industry. Ms Margolies' spokesman Ken Smukler responded to their article after publication, defending her pay over time and saying that she was paid less than the industry average for heads of non-profits- which is thought to be $94,924- when looking at her pay over the past decade rather than the past few years. 'The vote': Back in 1993, hers was one of the deciding votes that passed then-President Clinton's budget plan that increased taxes for the wealthy, and that caused her to be voted out . 'For six of the twelve years Marjorie has been leading WCI, her salary has been significantly lower than the industry standard. In 2013 Marjorie has, in fact, taken no salary at all,' he wrote to The Huffington Post. He blasted the reporter, Laura Goldman, for 'creating the false impression that marjorie has somehow used wci to line her pockets'. Adding to the fundraising climates in particular years, the WCI also receives grants- the budgets for which are at the whims of their own ties to the economy. 'Some years we are implementing multiple grants and all efforts are on program implementation and other times our staff efforts are on fundraising and proposal writing to secure more funding for projects. One of those grants- for $127,076- came directly from the State Department in 2011. That hefty grant comes as little surprise to political watchers, as Ms Margolies had a significant connection to the State Department at the time, and one who is a very big proponent of female empowerment work abroad: Hillary Clinton, her son's mother-in-law, was the Secretary of State at the time. Now that connection may be problematic for Clinton should she take her widely-predicted role as the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, as more questions will be raised about what portion of WCI's funding actually goes towards the programs they tout. MailOnline's efforts to reach out to Ms Margolies' campaign and WCI were not immediately returned. In addition to her work with the WCI, Ms Margolies teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. Head scratcher: Marc, seen here with former President Clinton, first met Chelsea at a Democratic conference in the 1990s. Both his mother and father, who later went on to jail, were in Congress at the time . She first ran for Congress in 1992, when she was known as Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and was married to former U.S. Representative Edward Mezvinsky, an Iowa Democrat who went on to become the party's state chairman in Pennsylvania. He went to prison in 2003 after he plead guilty to 31 out of 69 counts of bank, mail and wire fraud where he defrauded investors of $10million. Embarrassment of the in-laws: Edward Mezvinsky went to prison in 2003 after he plead guilty to 31 out of 69 counts of bank, mail and wire fraud where he defrauded investors of $10million . She stood by him for the first four years of his federal prison sentence before divorcing him in 2007, just one year before he was released. Margolies, who is now 71 years old, made a name for herself on a number of different fronts before her husband went to prison and decades before her son married a First Daughter. She was the first single American woman to adopt a foreign child, an experience that became the subject of her first book. And on August 5, 1993, during her term in Congress, Margolies-Mezvinsky cast one of the two final votes that gave Clinton's budget a dramatic victory in the House, 218-216. Just hours before she voted, she told a reporter she would oppose the bill, but she changed her mind after a phone call with Clinton minutes before the vote. Her 1994 challenger, Jon Fox, focused his campaign rhetoric on that decision, and voters in the wealthy district turned against her. In 2010, her son Marc married Chelsea Clinton and she said that she was very happy for the couple, who began dating five years earlier after meeting at a Democratic political retreat in South Carolina in 1993. ‘I’m totally delighted to be Chelsea Clinton’s mother-in-law; she’s a doll,’ she said at the time.","Marjorie Margolies is the mother of Marc Mezvinsky, who is married to Chelsea Clinton .

"By . Alan Douglas . Neil Lennon's future as Celtic manager is in serious doubt. Sportsmail understands the Northern Irishman feels he may have taken the club as far as it can go with him at the helm and is giving his position careful consideration. Fresh from winning a third successive Scottish league title, Lennon should now be plotting the route to a Champions League group campaign. Going out on a high? Celtic boss Neil Lennon clutches the Premiership trophy - which may be his last . Returning hero? Henrik Larsson has been installed as favourite to become new boss . But he’s believed to be concerned about having the quality in his squad to negotiate the three tricky qualifying ties that lie in wait  – with the added disadvantage of playing out of Murrayfield as Celtic Park is out of commission due to the Commonwealth Games. Speculation over Lennon’s future intensified when bookmakers Paddy Power suddenly slashed the odds on Henrik Larsson – currently in charge of Swedish club Falkenbergs - becoming the new manager. However, Hakan Nilsson, sports director of Falkensbergs, told Sportsmail there has been no contact from Celtic regarding the legendary striker. With Lennon due to fly off on holiday at the end of this week before a stint as a BBC analyst at the World Cup finals in Brazil, the former captain is seeking some answers before he goes. Trusted deputy Johan Mjallby recently quit the club and a decision on his replacement has been shelved until Lennon’s own fate becomes clearer. Speculation is also rife about the immediate futures of Virgil van Dijk and Fraser Forster and Lennon’s concerns over the squad would be further heightened were either to be sold before they begin their campaign on July 15. Shrouded in uncertainty: The futures of Fraser Forster(left) and Virgil van Dijk are up in the air . Barring a dramatic change of heart in the next 48 hours, there’s every chance Celtic will be beginning the search for their 17th manager by as soon as next week. If that comes to pass, Sportsmail believes former Celtic player and Cardiff manager Malky Mackay would top the wish list. Mackay holds the club in huge regard and has ambitions to manage at Parkhead one day – but he also has a wish to return to management in the English Premiership sooner rather than later. David Moyes, recently sacked by Manchester United, is free to consider a return to his first love but that option seems unlikely. Steve Clarke, the former West Brom manager, is also in the mix together with ex-Swansea deputy Morten Wieghorst. Jackie McNamara, the Dundee United manager, would be a popular choice with supporters although the acrimonious nature of his departure to Wolves in 2005 might count against him. Larsson, meanwhile, went from 20/1 outsider to odds-on favourite with two bookmakers. Meet the new boss? Jackie McNamara and former team-mate Lennon discuss the good old days last month . In the running: Malky Mackay has been touted for a Celtic return too . Whoever is appointed the next Celtic manager has a tough act to follow. Lennon served Celtic as a player between 2000 and 2007 before returning as first team coach the following season. He was demoted to reserve team manager after Gordon Strachan made way for Tony Mowbray but was asked to take charge of the team after the latter was shown the door after an inglorious spell in charge. After being given the job on a permanent basis in 2010, Lennon built his own side by snapping up the likes of Gary Hooper, Fraser Forster and Joe Ledley. His side narrowly missed out to Rangers in the 2010-11 SPL yet defeated Motherwell to win the Scottish Cup that season. The following season, Lennon, boosted by the acquisition of Victor Wanyama, finally got his hands on the title and the following term his men took the scalp of Barcelona as they qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League. Successive league titles were added last year and this – together with another Scottish Cup in 2013 and another Champions League qualification last year. Glory days: Lennon lifts the Scottish Cup in 2005 next to McNamara . But it appears increasingly likely that this year’s title triumph will be his last as Celtic boss. Meantime, the Scottish Football Association has postponed Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths’ disciplinary hearing to allow police to conclude their own investigation into allegations of racist chanting. The Celtic striker was due to face charges of bringing the game into disrepute and acting against the best interests of football on Thursday after he was filmed in a pub full of Hibernian supporters before attending the Edinburgh derby on April 27. But Griffiths’ lawyer has now won a two-week postponement while Police Scotland conclude their own investigation.","Neil Lennon's future at Celtic is in serious doubt .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Pictionary, 20 Questions, Trivial Pursuit, reading books and taking naps. That's how employees at an Obamacare processing plant spend their days, a former employee says. Lavonnne Takatz, 42, says she quit her job at . Obamacare contractor Serco's office in Wentzville, Missouri, just outside . St. Louis in April because she couldn't handle 'doing nothing' all day anymore. 'You could be completely sane and work there for seven months and leave there and almost want to check yourself into a mental hospital. It was that bad,' Takatz told St. Louis' News 4 KMOV. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . With paper applications on the decline after healthcare.gov began working more frequently, a whistle blower says said data entry personnel at Obamacare contractor Serco were only expected to enter two paper applications a month, 'and some people are not even able to do that.' Bring lots of pencils: A former employee at an Affordable Care Act processing center recalls having so little work to do that she played board games like Pictionary and Trivial Pursuit all day . This week KMOV ran a scathing report on alleged waste and abuse of taxpayer funds at Serco Inc.'s office featuring an unidentified whistle blower who said employees do nothing for days or weeks at a . time. The employee alleged that Serco was keeping its workforce unnecessarily high to get more money out of the federal government. 'They want to hire more people, even though we still don't have work to keep the people that we have busy,' the employee said. Serco is a subsidiary of international company Serco Group Pls. The company . has a 12-year $1.25 billion contract with the Department of Health and . Human Services to process paper Obamacare applications made through the . federal exchanges. The company has . three facilities that process Obamacare applications in Missouri, . Kentucky and Oklahoma. Employees who do data entry at those facilities . 'have hardly any work to do,' the whistle blower told KMOV. 'There a weeks that a data entry person would not process an application,' the employee said. 'They're told to sit at their computers and hit the refresh button every 10 minutes - no more than every 10 minutes. They're monitored - to hopefully look for an application.' With paper applications on the decline after healthcare.gov began working more frequently, the employee said data entry personnel were only expected to enter two applications a month, 'and some people are not even able to do that.' After it began looking into the initial whistle blower's claims, KMOV found even more current and former Serco employees who were willing to attest that the company is wasting government resources, including Takatz. 'I think for the entire month of December, I processed six applications, ' Takatz said. 'And that was actually pretty good, correct?' KMOV reporter Chris Nagus asked her. 'That was pretty good,' she confirmed. Another employee who wished to remain anonymous told KMOV that her supervisor told her department that if they processed two applications a month,  their job was done. So bored were employees, Serco gave them books to read, Takatz said. 'We played Pictionary on a very large dry erase board,' she said. 'We had to create games, basically for ourselves.' Employees were not allowed to bring in cell phones, she said, adding to the monotony. 'It was prison. We all referred to it as our cell blocks,' she told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Game-master: Outgoing HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (L) has become a much-scorned Obama administration figure, but will son be able to leave Obamacare's woes behind her . Dubious inheritance: Sylvia Burwell has been nominated to take over HHS for Sebelius, taking on the thankless job of steering Obamacare through a rocky channel fraught with political landmines . Thumb-twiddler-in-chief? Serco program director John Lau presided over a workforce with nothing but time on their hands . Takatz says she worked at the facility for six months from October to April before her boredom and her conscience got the best of her. 'I feel guilty for working there as long as I did,' she told the  'It was like I was stealing money from people.' The . employee who originally contacted KMOV alleged that Serco isn't firing employees it doesn't need . because the more people it has working on the project, the more money it . gets from the government. 'So they want us there, even if we're not doing anything.' Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill says an employee of the Cognosante, a . subcontractor for Serco, told her office that when CMS came to visit . their facility, they were instructed to 'sit at their desks and pretend . to work even though they had no work to do. McCaskill sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General asking him to 'evaluate these claims and, if warranted, undertake a thorough investigation.' 'If it's anything like what the whistle-blowers suggest, it's terrible,' Missouri Senator Roy Blunt told Fox News on . Wednesday. 'If it's exactly what the whistleblowers suggest, it's an . absolute . outrage for every taxpayer in America.' Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, whose congressional district encompasses the area where the Obamacare contractor's office is located,'is talking with all relevant committees of jurisdiction to discuss whether or not an investigation is warranted,' a spokesman said. Zzzzzzzzobamacare: Workers tasked with entering nonexistent health insurance enrollments often resorted to napping on the job . Serco program director John Lau (right) has already had to testify before Congress in October about his company's involvement in Obamacare . The first . health care open enrollment period technically ended in March, but it . was extended by the federal government to mid-April for people having . problems with the website. Only certain groups of people such as young . people aging off their parents' health insurance can enroll for . Obamacare at this time. The . next open enrollment period does not being until the middle of . November. The government expects repairs to healthcare.gov to be . finished by that time, which will likely reduce the frequency of paper . applications even further. Serco has been declining to comment for the story. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services -  HHS agency overseeing the federal health exchanges - told KMOV that, 'Serco is committed to making sure federal funds are spent appropriately, and the number of Serco staff is reviewed on a regular basis,' KMOV says. Serco's UK parent company is one of the leading contractors with Great Britain's government. In 2012, the company admitted to the National Health Service that it . lied 252 times over a six month period about the performance of out of . hours doctors. It is currently under investigation in the UK by the Serious Fraud Office for charging the Ministry of Justice to electronically tag criminals that were in jail or dead. The company has already agreed to repay the govenment nearly £70 million for the falsified work related to the tagging scheme, BBC reports, and it could end up paying more. Serco's behavior in Great Britian was so crooked that it was tporarially banned from competing for government contracts in that country. The ban was lifted in February and Serco is now contracting with the governmnet again. When approached about Serco's terrible track record abroad last summer, a spokesman for CMS told Reuters, Serco is a highly skilled company that has a proven track  record in . providing cost-effective services to numerous other federal . agencies.'

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . President Obama came out swinging at Republicans on Monday night during a high-dollar fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Maryland, saying their concerns about the 2012 Benghazi terror attack and his Obamacare medical insurance law were 'not serious.' His latest antagonistic salvo will enrage the GOP, as it brings to mind his July 2013 pronouncement that the fast-brewing controversies engulfing his presidency were 'phony scandals.' Obama never specific which scandals were 'phony' during a Galesburg, Illinois speech about economic issues. But at the time a quartet of all-hands-on-deck crises were swirling around the West Wing: the National Security Agency's publicly leaked surveillance programs, the Internal revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups, his Justice Department's seizure of reporters' phone records and emails, and the Benghazi attack that killed four Americans. On Monday, he played to a sympathetic crowd of about 65 people who paid up to $32,400 per couple to dine with the president at the home of a wealthy supporter in the tony Washington, D.C. suburb of Potomac, Maryland. The new 'phony scandals' spin: On Monday night Obama, shown May 14 making the case for infrastructure spending, called concerns about the 2012 Benghazi terror attack and his Obamacare medical insurance law 'not serious' 'Not serious': The U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, LIbya erupted in flames on September 11, 2012 after heavily armed terrorists linked to an al-Qaeda affiliate group launched mortars and grenades and followed up with small-arms fire . Pointing a finger at Republicans, he lobbed rhetorical grenades in the hope of firing up his base for the coming November congressional election. 'Yes, we could reform government and streamline it, and update it so that it is capable to meet the concerns of the 21st century and it can be more customer-friendly,' he said during a 15-minute speech. 'And yes, we do have to worry about issues like long-term debt – although the primary source of long-term debt is health care costs, and if we can help drive those down we’ll be just fine.' 'But that’s not the debate that’s taking place right now,' Obama continued, blaming the GOP for focusing on his administration's apparent shortcomings. 'The debate we’re having right now is about, what – Benghazi? Obamacare?' an incredulous Obama asked, according to a White House transcript. 'And it becomes this endless loop. It's not serious. It's not speaking to the real concerns that people have.' A Politico/GfK poll published Monday indicates that those concerns are split. The survey found that the economy is the most often cited national issue that concerns voters the most, with 26 per cent of Americans choosing it from a list of 13 hot-button topics. But when those who expressed negative opinions about government were asked what brought the worst impact to members of their immediate family, more cited health care and taxes than all other issues combined. The Politico poll did not include any questions about Benghazi. 'Not serious': White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has been fending off questions about Obamacare since its disastrous launch in October . The . poll did show, however, that Obama's job-performance approval ratings . are significantly under water, making his coattails shorter than ever as . November approaches. Fully . 59 per cent of those surveyed said they disapprove of the president's . job performance, including 41 per cent who said they 'strongly . disapprove.' Forty per cent approved of his performance in office, with the 'strongly approve' option chosen by just 15 per cent. Obama . insisted Monday night that while Republicans – particularly tea party . conservatives – are obstructing his agenda, Democrats are behaving like . sober post-partisans. 'We've . got one party in Congress right now that has been captured by . ideologues whose core premise is ""no,"" he said, 'who fundamentally . believe that the problem is government ... and whose principal focus at . any given point in the day is trying to figure out how can they make . people sufficiently cynical, sufficiently angry, sufficiently suspicious . that they can win the next election. 'I hate to be blunt about it, but that’s the play,' Obama fumed. Republicans are generally expected to outperform Democrats in the coming midterms, needing a pickup of six Senate seats to control both chambers of Congress for the first time since 2006. No prognosticator of national significance has predicted that Democrats can retake the House of Representatives, with most citing Obamacare as their main stumbling block.","The president spoke to wealthy partisans in one of the richest suburbs of Washington, D.C., blasting Republicans for not joining with his priorities .
The GOP has been 'captured' by the tea party, he suggested .
The result is a GOP that obstructs his agenda with scandals, including the 2012 terror attack in Libya and his medical insurance overhaul law .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Victim: April Taylor, 31, was stung 40 times last Tuesday and died three days later in a Utah hospital . An amateur beekeeper with a 6-year-old son has died after what appears to be a fatal allergic reaction to 40 stings. April Taylor was wearing gloves and a beekeeping veil when she was stung by some of the bees that she kept in her family's back yard in Willard, Utah. Those precautions did not cover her entirely, however, as many beekeepers regularly wear full suits and high boots to insure that they are entirely covered when they interact with the insects. Mrs Taylor, 31, came into her house on Tuesday May 13 and showed her husband Zac how she had been stung 30 or 40 times. He told the Deseret News that she said she seemed fine but later that day she went back outside and he found her passed out. She was rushed to the local hospital but died three days later at Ogden Regional Medical Center. 'We all started thinking, ""Well, how did this happen? … Killer bees or what? But I guess after she had got stung, her husband called the beekeeper, and he came and figured out there was no queen bee in the hive,""' Zak Taylor's uncle Bruce Vail told the paper. 'He said if there's no queen bee in the hive, they get really protective of their hive and they just swarmed her.' According to her Facebook page, Mrs Taylor also suffered from multiple sclerosis. Hobby: Mrs Taylor, seen with her husband of 11 years Zak Taylor, was a hairdresser by trade but kept bees in her backyard . Tragic: The couple has a 6-year-old son named Lux (pictured with his face blurred because of his age) 'Just a free spirit, nice girl, good mother,' Mr Vail said. 'They just swarmed her, it was a freak thing.' Agriculture officials are investigating the incident, and have not yet been able to determine if it was an official attack. 'We're not certain that this was an attack. We feel this is a stinging event,' Larry Lewis from the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food told KSL. The concern is whether or not the fatal stings were a result of honeybees being cross-bred with Africanized bees which are generally more defensive and aggressive than the typically-docile bees found across the United States. 'Anytime someone is stung and passes away, that's a serious event,' Mr Lewis said. Prepared: April Taylor was properly covered with gloves and a beekeeping veil when she was stung by some of the bees that she kept in her family's back yard in Willard, Utah (stock image at right) Vivacious: Mrs Taylor, seen here with her son in an undated photo, suffered from multiple sclerosis . Left behind: Zak Taylor, pictured with their son, said that he saw his wife's sings but said she seemed fine and it was only later when he found her passed out in their backyard that he called an ambulance . 'We want to know exactly what happened and whether they were European honeybees, or Africanized, or any kind of percentage of Africanized bees. It’s unlikely that it’s Africanized.' According to Boston Children's Hospital, about two million people in the United States are allergic to bee stings and about 100 people die every year as a result of the stings. April and Zak Taylor were married in 2002 and have a 6-year-old son named Lux. Home: The bees were stored in the Taylor's backyard (their home pictured in 2012) According to her obituary, April was a licensed hairdresser who worked out of her home and a local barber shop. She graduated from Box Elder High School in 2001 and later attended Bridgerland Cosmetology School. Her hobbies included camping, fishing, gardening, and attending Renaissance Faires. Her funeral will be held on Wednesday in Brigham City.","April Taylor, 31, was wearing a protective veil and gloves when stung .

"By . Ashley Collman . A Houston, Texas mom hammed it up for her mugshot when she was arrested for drunkenly dropping her infant last month, but she won't find the next six months in prison so funny. Sandra Luann Grohmann, of suburban Humble was handed a 180 sentence on Monday after pleading guilty to charges of endangering the welfare of a child.

She was arrested last month after a witness saw her drop her 1-month-old baby on the side of a busy road . Cops arrived on the scene to find Grohmann drunk and under the influence of prescription medicine. Paramedics determined the child was not hurt, and the infant was put in the protection of social workers. Humble Police Detective Sergeant Mike Flynt described in detail the incident that happened on a Tuesday. 'The witnesses saw Grohmann pushing the stroller about five feet away from the roadway when she fell for the first time partially knocking her unrestrained child out of the stroller,' Sgt Flynt said. 'She then tried to get back up and put the baby back in the stroller when she fell again causing the baby to fall all the way out of the stroller and roll into the grass. She then tried to get back up, falling for the third time,' he added. Grohmann was arrested at the scene and taken to Harris County Jail where she was held on $2,000 bail.","Sandra Luann Grohmann, 29, was arrested last month when a witness saw her drop her 1-month-old baby on the side of a busy road .

He went on to say 'can you see it would be insensitive to the the families who lost loved ones?' Cawthorne, a 63-year-old who calls himself 'Britain's most published living author', was forced to admit he had no idea about what happened to the doomed flight during a cringe-worthy six-minute interview.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . and Francesca Chambers . Republicans on Capitol Hill announced Wednesday evening that just 67 per cent of Americans who bought Obamacare plans through the federal government's health insurance marketplace have sealed the deal by actually paying for their policies. GOP members of the House Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations said they went to 'all 160 insurance providers in the federally facilitated marketplace' for the data after the White House repeatedly insisted it didn't have numbers to share. The startling results will reignite the protracted political fight over the Affordable Care Act that has dogged the Obama administration since shortly after the president took office. Not so fast, Mr. President: Obama announced on April 17 that 8 million Americans had chosen health insurance plans through his 'federally facilitated marketplace,' but only 2/3 thirds of them appear to have paid their bills . With one-third of enrollees yet to pay premiums, Obamacare's delicate financial balance between healthy young Americans and sicker retirees is very much an unsettled question . Committee staff released state-by-state numbers for the 36 states that participated in the federal government's on-again, off-again online insurance exchange. As of April 15, 88 per cent of new Obamacare customers in Arkansas and 87 per cent in Kansas had paid up; on the other end of the scale, only 42 per cent in Texas and 48 per cent in Oklahoma could say the same. The other states in the survey fell somewhere in between. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia ran their own online marketplaces; The Capitol Hill Republicans didn't poll insurers in any of them. 'In a sad reversal away from its vows of transparency, the Obama administration, from inside the Oval Office on down, has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep basic details of the health law from the public,' claimed Michigan Republican Rep. Fred Upton, who chairs the Energy & Commerce Committee. 'Tired of receiving incomplete pictures of enrollment in the health care law, we went right to the source and found that the administration's recent declarations of success may be unfounded.' 'We need a complete picture of how this law is working,' Upton said in a statement. 'We will continue to strive for transparency and hold the administration accountable for this law’s shortcomings and broken promises.' The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fired back hours later, however, saying the Republicans' homework was incomplete. 'These claims are based on only about half of the approximately 300 issuers in the federally-facilitated marketplace,' CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said in a statement Wednesday night, 'and they do not match up with public comments from insurance companies themselves, most of which indicate that 80 to 90 percent of enrollees have paid their premium.' 'Additionally,' Albright said, 'given the significant surge in enrollments at the end of March, it stands to reason that not all enrollees would have paid by the date of this so-called report since many people’s bills were not even due yet.' White Press Secretary Jay Carney said on Thursday that the report was a manifestation of Republicans' irritation that Obamacare was succeeding. He would not confirm that 80 percent or more of enrollees had followed through on paying their premiums. However, he said he was 'confident it’s not going to be 67 percent.' 'We don't have hard, concrete numbers, but we dispute their numbers,' Carney said. The White House Press Secretary refused to share even partial figures with reporters because he said he did not want to give out unreliable information. Committee Republicans said they would revisit the totals in mid-May to see if the percentages improve. 'We don't have hard, concrete numbers, but we dispute their numbers,' White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters on Thursday . House Energy & Commerce Committee chairman Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, released the report that indicated the White House's Obamacare enrollment numbers may be significantly inflated . It's unclear why Republicans announced totals from what they said were 'all 160 insurance providers' that issue policies through healthcare.gov while the Obama administration claimed there were 300 such companies. The administration's number first surfaced during an October 24, 2013 congressional hearing, chaired by Upton. Cheryl Campbell, the senior vice president of CGI Federal – the company seen as most responsible for healthcare.gov's early-day tech disasters – said then that 'more than 300 insurers, with more than 4,500 insurance plans' were participating. Advocacy organizations across the U.S. ran a full-court press for six months in an attempt to enroll Americans, but they emphasized paying premiums far less . The administration has not, however, suggested that surveying 160 insurers would provide an inaccurate estimate for all 300. Henry . Waxman, a California congressman who is the Democrats' ranking member . on the subcommittee, called Wednesday's report 'rubbish.' House . Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a calculating Virginia Republican, . emphasized that his party's data 'stand in stark contrast to . the White House's previous assertions.' 'While the . administration was eager to declare that Obamacare's mandate had worked, . it has so far not provided any substantive data to back that up. If . President Obama disputes the information provided by the insurance . companies, he should direct HHS to immediately release complete . enrollment data, including how many people were previously insured.' The number has become a sticking point in Washington, with most estimates painting a dim picture of the law's overall success in its quest to add tens of millions to the ranks of the insured. McKinsey & Co. surveyed Americans and found that only 27 percent who bought new health insurance in February lacked insurance before. That number had been just 11 per cent in January. Goldman Sachs has projected that barely 1 million of the 8 million Obamacare enrollees to date will gain insurance they didn't previously have. A report from the RAND Corporation puts that number at 25 per cent  of the overall total. But the interim picture includes a sobering look at how many young people signed up – and paid – for Obamacare plans during the six-month open enrollment period that ended March 31. Just 25 per cent, according to the insurance companies, were between age 18 and age 35. The Obama administration said in mid-April that it believed 28 percent of new policyholders were in that age group. But some industry insiders have held out hope that the number would top 40 per cent. 'In an ideal world, you’d want to get as close to that as possible,' Kaiser Family Foundation senior vice president Larry Levitt told The New York Times after Obama took his very public April 17 victory lap. The Affordable Care Act's financial model requires a large contingent of young, healthy Americans to buy insurance, with their premiums covering the spiraling costs of treating the old and sick.","President Obama triumphantly announced April 17 that 8 million Americans had enrolled .

"By . Ryan Lipman . A poll of 1,000 professional workers has revealed 19 per cent of Australian men blame women's 'lack of ambition' for stopping them reaching the top of their profession and taking leadership roles. Interestingly, 13 per cent of women also agreed with their male counterparts in the survey by workplace consultant Positive Leaders. The study showed that most men think it's women who are responsible for themselves not reaching the top of their professions, with family commitments also cited as a main cause, along with a lack of professional drive. A poll of 1000 professional workers shows that Australian men blame women's lack of ambition and family commitments from allowing them to take the top spots in the workplace . Further, 60 per cent of the men surveyed believe women do have equal career opportunities - something only 33 per cent of women agreed with, reported The Australian. Women blamed juggling a work-life balance for preventing them from nabbing top positions, with 83 per cent seeing it as the biggest challenge, something about 66 per cent of men agreed with. Other findings included close to one in 10 male workers believing men perform leadership roles better, something only 6 per cent of women agreed with. About 16 per cent of men and women saw a lack of qualifications and experience as a barrier holding back, while 25 per cent of women favoured measures to help their careers, in contrast to 61 per cent wanting more flexibility 38 per cent wanting more help at home. Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick and Screen Australia chairman Glen Boreham have both hit out at the poll's findings claiming women do not lack ambition . But Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick hit out at the findings on Wednesday, saying there was no evidence to support women lacked ambition. 'What most women want is to build a strong career while caring for those they love. Perhaps their ambitions do not fit the ideal worker model as well as men's do,' she said. Ms Broderick said this model needed to change and not women, with many organisations favouring '24/7' employees with no other commitments. She added that many workplaces had been designed with men in mind and not women and while this framework had failed female workers, it was also letting down male employees who wanted to be involved fathers and increasingly as the population ages, support their elderly parents. Despite women making up close to half of the workforce, just 3.5 per cent are chief executive officers, only 18 per cent represent directors in the top 200 companies listed on the stock exchange and more than a third of the listed companies have no female directors. Positive Leaders partner Michelle McQuaid, pictured, said companies were moving away from trying to make women more assertive and masculine, and were instead embracing feminine qualities such as patience . Echoing the sentiments of Ms Broderick, Screen Australia chairman and former IBM managing director Glen Boreham said he did not believe women lacked ambition in their professional careers. 'I think it's about the overreach of the old boys' club,' he said on Wednesday. Mr Boreham said traditionally, the ideal worker had no kids or elderly parents who could take their attention from work. He also said there was a notion that if an employee was not seen at the office from 8am to 5pm they were seen as slacking off and anyone working flexibly, regardless of gender, was also seen as not fulfilling their workplace obligations. In contrast Mr Boreham said a diverse workplace was better for business, with different opinions aid problem solving. Contrast: About 60 per cent of the men surveyed believe women do have equal career opportunities, while something only 33 per cent of women agreed . Challenging outdated notions, he believes when an employee feels trusted and able to balance with work and family life, they will often make an put in extra work when needed. Positive Leaders partner Michelle McQuaid said the poll proved that women it was pointless for women to try and follow their male colleagues' workplace behaviours. Ms McQuaid, whose clients include Amex, IMB, NAB and Crown Casion, said companies were moving away from trying to 'fix' women by making them more masculine and assertive, but rather opting for a focus on 'feminine traits' such as empathy, patience, flexibility and collaboration in senior management and the value these can bring.","A poll shows Australian men blame women's lack of ambition for stopping them reaching the top of their profession .

"By . Freya Noble . Rivers, creeks dams and streams claim more Australian lives than even our roughest beaches, according to a new report . Over the past decade, 735 people died while swimming in rivers, creeks and streams, with 46 per cent of those incidents occurring in regional or remote areas. Released on Wednesday,the Royal Lifesaving Society's Drowning Deaths in Australian Rivers report reveals that nearly 40 per cent of those incidents involved alcohol. Remote rivers, creeks and streams claimed the most lives in Australia at 'aquatic locations' a new study revealed, pictured is The Murray River where more people drowned than anywhere else in the country . Of that 40 per cent, more than two thirds involved people with a blood alcohol concentration higher than 0.05, which is the legal driving limit.

'Rivers account for more drownings than beaches or swimming pools.' 'The flat, still appearance of rivers often lull people into a false sense of safety.' Less people lost their lives at beaches or swimming pools than in calm rural waterways . 'Time and again we see people taking unnecessary risks that often have tragic outcomes, especially where alcohol is involved.' he continued. The report also revealed that 80 per cent of those who died in creeks and rivers were male, while a quarter of all drownings were people aged 25 to 44 years old. Mr Scarr said people need to shift their thinking when undertaking activities in remote areas. Though there is knowledge of beach safety, less is known about preventing drownings in rivers the study says . 'It's high time that people treated rivers with the same respect they have learned to show when recreating at the beach.' The Murray River claimed the most lives of any location in the country, with a death toll of 43. The Brisbane River in Queensland and the Yarra River in Victoria ranked second and third. These were followed by the Swan River (WA), Hawkesbury River (NSW), Murrumbidgee River (NSW), Sandy Creek (QLD), Derwent River (TAS), Katherine River (NT) and the Macquarie River (NSW).

"By . Emily Crane . A bright purple, alien like jellyfish has washed up on a Queensland beach and scientists believe it could be an undiscovered species. The glowing purple jellyfish was found by lifeguards on Coolum Beach on the Sunshine Coast on Wednesday morning. The extraordinary colour of the marine creature has baffled marine experts, who are now trying to determine what species it is. Lifeguards located a bright purple jellyfish at Coolum Beach on the Sunshine Coast on Wednesday . 'It's straight out of science fiction,' marine biologist Dr Lisa Gershwin said. 'It's an electric, vibrant, wow purple.' She said the tentacles - or oral arms - were about a metre long and were covered in microscopic mouths. Dr Gershwin, who works at the CSIRO marine and atmospheric research centre, said it was probably a new species because of the vivid colour. 'The colour just screams “Don't mess with me”,' Dr Gershwin said. 'It's not just a little purple – this sucker is seriously purple.' Experts believe the jellyfish could be a new species because of the vivid colour . Dr Gershwin believes the jellyfish could be a thysanostoma, but said the species was normally brown or beige. 'It begs the question, if it's such a vibrant, different colour, what other features does it have?' she said. 'When we get it under the microscope I think we'll start noticing all kinds of things.' It's rare to find thysanostoma in Australian waters and even rarer to spot one off Queensland's southeast coast as they prefer the warmer tropical waters.","Lifeguards find bright, vivid purple jellyfish on Coolum Beach .

"By . James Chapman . Warning: Britain's status as a free-market nation is at risk from 'the forces of pessimism', Chancellor George Osborne will claim today . Britain's status as a free-market nation is at risk from ‘the forces of pessimism’ who are waging war on big business, George Osborne will claim today. An anti-business alliance of Labour and the ‘populist Right’ – a reference to Ukip – want to ‘pull up the drawbridge and shut Britain off from the world’, the Chancellor will say. ‘They want to constrain foreign investment in our economy, and deprive us of the British jobs that it has created in industries from car manufacturing to energy,’ he will tell the Confederation of British Industry. ‘They want to set prices, regulate incomes, impose  rent controls, wage war on  big business, demonise wealth creation, renationalise industries – and pretend that  they can re-establish  control over all aspects of the economy. ‘Whether from the Left or the populist Right, we now see a deeply pessimistic, depressing, anti-business agenda.’ Mr Osborne’s remarks are designed as a trenchant attack of the economic policies of Labour’s Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, who have unsettled business leaders with a series of 1970s-style policy proposals. But it is also a provocative riposte to those in his own party and Ukip who have expressed concern about foreign take-overs – most recently the stalled Pfizer bid for British-based drugs firm AstraZeneca. Mr Osborne is said to have been the leading Government champion of a controversial attempt by the US giant to merge with AstraZeneca. The now stalled bid was prompted at least in part by UK tax breaks for businesses. The Chancellor has repeatedly slashed . the headline rate of corporation tax, despite the Government’s austerity . measures, to encourage firms to invest in and move to the UK. He will tell business leaders that Britain has been brought ‘back from the brink’ and hail a ‘real sense of optimism that is growing in Britain today’. But he will warn that it would be a ‘grave mistake’ to think that repairing the economy is complete and the country can ‘go easy and slow down’. 'Our task to secure our country’s economic future is not even half done. ‘This is a decade-long turn-around job we have embarked on – and we are determined to see it through.’ Mr Osborne;s remarks are designed as a trenchant attack of the economic policies of Labour's Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, who have unsettled business leaders with a series of 1970s-style policy proposals, and Ukip leader Nigel Farage . He will also highlight the cracks in Britain’s reputation as an ‘open, free-trading, free-market economy and a welcome home for business’ as a growing threat to the nation’s future prosperity. For all of my adult life, since the fall of the Berlin Wall in the year I left school, there has been a  political consensus in this country that Britain’s future lies as an open, market economy,’ he will say. ‘Since then, under governments of all political persuasions, we have championed free trade – and welcomed  foreign investment – and built competitive, open markets under the supervision of robust independent regulation. ‘You [CBI members] know what a huge advantage it is for Britain that you can say that Britain is the most open, competitive economy in Europe – and that commitment to  openness, independent regulation, free and competitive markets existing regardless of the  political make-up of the Government. 'Sadly, that consensus that we put the national economic interest first – ahead of opportunist party advantage – is under threat for the first time in 25 years.’","George Osborne will claim free market at risk from 'forces of pessimism'

"By . Kate Lyons . James Mathison, host of soon-to-be axed Channel 10 breakfast show, Wake Up, is the first of those hit by the sweeping cuts to Channel 10 to respond publicly. His message: I need a drink. 'Scotch anyone? Scotchy, scotch, scotch, down in my belly,' tweeted Mathison who would have been in need of a stiff drink after the day he has had. Channel Ten announced sweeping cuts to the network, including  axing its breakfast show Wake Up, early, morning and late news bulletins, resulting in the loss of up to 150 jobs. Dismal ratings: Ten's breakfast show Wake Up has been cancelled after it suffered its worst week of ratings since it launched in November . Wake Up was launched in November 2013, in a bid to compete with Channel Seven's Sunrise and Channel Nine's Today and rumours have been circulating for weeks that the struggling show might be about to get the chop. Channel 10 staff were informed of the cuts today, though the extent of the redundancies are not yet known. Ten CEO Hamish McLennan informed his staff of the cuts in an email this morning. 'It is a tough period for Ten and we need to take some painful, but necessary, measures to restructure the business,' the email to staff said. 'Unfortunately, it is proposed that Wake Up and the Early, Morning and Late News will cease production on Friday, May 23, 2014. Studio 10 is performing well and will continue as a vital part of our daytime schedule, which ranks number one.' He concluded the email saying: 'The next few weeks will be a difficult and sad period, as colleagues leave the business.' Channel 10 CEO Hamish McLennan informed staff today that the breakfast show Wake Up and some news bulletins will be axed. It is rumoured that up to 150 jobs will be cut . As well as Wake Up, the struggling network will also cut its 5.30am, 11am, and 10.30pm news bulletins, though it will continue to produce the 5pm news bulletin. A source at Channel 10 told MailOnline that seven journalists had been fired already, and only five camera-people were to be kept on to cover news in Sydney. 'Bureaus in LA and London have gone,' she added. The source also confirmed that the morning news bulletin, which runs during the Studio 10 program, would remain in some form, though there was confusion as to who would be responsible for its production. 'We don't have our Studio 10 news bulletin in that news won't be doing it, but it's still up in the air how it will work, so we might just have to be self sufficient with it,' she said. Natarsha Belling appeared upset as she left Wake Up's Manly studio this morning amid reports the show was about to be axed . Wake Up staff hugged ans supported one another this morning, just hours before the announcement that their show would be cancelled . Ms Belling has been a host on the show since it was launched in November 2013. The Channel 10 breakfast show has struggled to attract an audience . The Sydney Morning Herald reported there was confusion among Channel 10 employees about how the cuts would affect local news bulletins. From Friday, 23 May, there will be no more Wake Up breakfast show on Channel 10. The Early, 5.30am, Morning, 11am and Late, 10.30pm, news bulletins will also not exist. The 5pm bulletin will remain on air and will be produced locally in each state. The morning talk show Studio 10 will also continue to be produced . There will be 150 job losses at Channel 10. There is speculation that seven journalists have reportedly been fired already, and only five camera-people are to be kept on to cover news in Sydney. It is thought news bureaus in London and Los Angeles have also been shut down. And it is rumoured that Wake Up might be replaced by a revamped version of Good Morning Australia, with Kerri-Anne Kennerley named as a possible host. They reported that one source said Channel 10 would keep state-based newsreaders but the news content would be national, but another source denied this saying there was no point to state-based newsreaders if you don’t have state-based news. The cuts have occurred as the network has struggled with ratings and advertising. 'Revenue is down the toilet and the ratings are less than auspicious,' Peter Meakin, Network Ten news and current affairs director told the Australian Financial Review this morning. 'Whether I disagree with the cuts is purely academic. I'm not briefed to run the company and have very little financial experience. 'Clearly the board has had a look at it and this is the decision they’ve made and I guess we have to live it,' said Mr Meakin. Wake Up was the brainchild of Sunrise mastermind Adam Boland, and was launched in November 2013, with three hosts, Natasha Exelby, James Mathison, and Natarsha Belling. Just 16-days later, Ms Exelby was cut from the panel, after it was decided the show's chemistry was not working. It has struggled to attract viewers, averaging 30-40,000 per day, around a tenth of the viewers tuning in to Channels Nine and Seven. In his email to staff, Mr McLennan stated: 'Wake Up has not resonated with enough viewers to make it a viable program.' Channel Ten' Wake Up presenter Natarsha Belling appeared upset as she left the show's Manly studios this morning as other staff hugged and supported each other amid reports the show is about to be canned due to low ratings. Mr McLennan told staff this morning: 'Let me assure you the changes are not being undertaken lightly. 'No one is happy about them, but unfortunately they are necessary.' The last episode of the program will be aired this Friday. Possible contenders: Kerri-Anne Kennerley, left, or Matt White, right, could be brought in to host a new show . Adam Boland, who had a breakdown three days after the show launched and left it in January 2014 to take care of his health, tweeted his support for his former colleagues. 'I feel very sad for all my friends at Ten. Very good people, let down by many things, including my early exit. Thinking of them all today,' he wrote. 'Some brilliant Ch10 staff are gonna be looking for work. An astute employer would snap em up quick smart,' wrote Dave Hughes, comedian and former co-host of Channel 10's The Project. Studio 10 host Joe Hildebrand also took to Twitter to express his sadness at the decision, writing: 'Taking on titans like Sunrise and Today is the toughest job in TV and our mates at @WakeUp did it with heart and guts. Farewell friends.' Sarah Harris and Jessica Rowe, Studio 10 co-hosts, also took to Twitter in support of their colleagues. 'Big hugs to my friends at Wake Up, Early/Morning News and Late News,' said Sarah. Jessica wrote: 'Thinking of my friends and colleagues at Wake Up, morning and late news...

Grandfather Yang Fei Lin became heated at the Supreme Court on Wednesday as he recounted a series of conversations he had with his son-in-law Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie in the months after the murder of five family members in July 2009. Speaking through an interpreter, Mr Lin stood up in the witness box and re-enacted the dispute, which he said took place in September 2009. Yang Fei Lin (right) became heated at the Supreme Court on Wednesday as he recounted a series of conversations he had with accused Lin family killer Robert Xie. He is pictured leaving court with his wife Feng Qing Zhu (left) on Tuesday . 'Robert was really angry, jumped up and shouted ""Why do you think there are two families now. I hate you all to death"",' Mr Lin recalled. Xie is accused of creeping into the home of his brother-in-law Min Lin and sister-in-law Lily Lin in North Epping in the early hours of July 18, 2009. The crown says that, motivated by bitterness, Xie killed Min, Lily, the couple's two sons Henry, 12, and Terry, nine, and Lily's sister Irene, with a hammer-like weapon. Mr Lin told the court that, by the end of 2009, a dispute had broken out about the guardianship of the surviving member of the family and assets of their dead son, newsagent Min Lin. Kathy's (left) husband Lian Bin Xie is standing trial for the murder of five members of his wife's family in the bedrooms of their North Epping home in July 2009 . In this argument, Mr Lin said Xie 'got really angry' and questioned why he would not give any of the inheritance to his wife and Mr Lin's daughter Kathy. At this point, Mr Lin said he and his wife Feng Qing Zhu reacted, saying: 'We are not dead yet. How can you fight over the assets with us'. Mr Lin said he believed his son had assets totalling more than $2 million at the time of his death. The court has previously heard Xie and Kathy had not worked steady jobs since moving to Sydney in 2005. Mr Lin said he had told Xie prior to the murders that they weren't happy about that, to which he replied: 'Well everyone has their own different lifestyles'. The court heard that in the year before Lily's death, Mr Lin found her diary that had a series of entries about a man called Rob. 'Having been trained by Rob these years, and lived with him 'together' made me a lot more familiar with him ... I hate to part with him,' she wrote in one entry. Mr Lin said he confronted his daughter-in-law about it, saying 'my family does not have extra-marital affairs'. He said Lily wouldn't tell him who Rob is, simply saying he was 'from the pyramid selling business'. The court has previously heard that Lily suffered from a mild mental illness and would occasionally believe she was having affairs with men. Xie has pleaded not guilty. His trial continues.

"By . Freya Noble . Swimmer Michael Klim has urged fans to help bring his 'dear friend' Nico White home to Australia from Bali, after he suffered the 'worst possible' brain injury in a motorbike crash. Mr White was hit by a car while riding in the Kerobokan area in the early hours of Friday. The 43-year-old Australian is in an induced coma in a Bali hospital, while his family scrambles to raise the $100,000 needed for his medical evacuation. 'Our dear friend Nicho White who lives in Bali was in a serious accident and is fighting for his life in intensive care and needs your help to get him back home for treatment ASAP,' Klim wrote on his Facebook page on Tuesday. Nico White, 43, is in an induced coma in Bali and his family are trying to raise $100K to bring him home . 'Head to Save Nicho White Appeal and donate now, please I’m begging you,' the Olympian added. Klim also lives in Bali with his wife Lindy, a Balinese princess. Mr White remains in intensive care in a Denpasar hospital after his accident, which is costing his Melbourne family up to $6000 a day. The once-fit surfer is suffering from serious head, chest and leg injuries and doctors have advised it will be best to medically evacuate him to Australia, at a cost of around $100,000. Celebrities including high profile fashion designers such as Alice McCall and Nicholas Morley have already contributed to the fundraising page. Begging: Swimmer Michael Klim (pictured here with his wife Lindy on Wednesday in Sydney) has urged his fans to help bring back his 'dear friend' from Bali . Ms McCall wrote: 'Dear White Mcgills, you are like family to me, I hope this donation can help with Nicho’s fight to service. He is a strong sweet kind funny talented human being who is meant to be here with us on earth for years to come. Nicho there is so much love for you, shine on .Alice xxxx'. Stepfather Ian McGill said attempts to bring Mr White out of the coma have so far been unsuccessful. 'In the scheme if seriousness, I think the doctor said it's the worst he's seen in terms of possible brain injury,' Mr McGill told AAP on Tuesday. More...

Mr White was hit by a car while riding his motorbike early on Friday morning . The accident happened in the beachside town of Kerobokan in Bali . A fundraising page on the website youcaring.com has so far raised more than $91,000 - slowly climbing to its goal of $250,000. The fundraiser was set up by his stepfather Ian McGill, and Ian's wife Lyn McGill. The campaign states: 'We have set up this fundraising website because so many generous people have been offering to contribute to the increasing medical expenses for Nicho's care following his terrible motorbike accident. 'On Friday morning, May 16, Nicho was riding his motorbike along Kerobokan and was knocked off the road by a car, driven by a poor Indonesian man who has no money to contribute.' So far, attempts to bring the 43-year-old out of the coma have been unsuccessful . Mr White’s family has made a desperate plea to raise funds to bring him home for medical treatment as he did not have medical insurance . Mr McGill said support has come from Melbourne, where he and Lyn lived until two years ago, and Bali, a second home for years before that. In Bali, Mr White designs jewellery and his sister Jessie is the founder of fashion label Shakuhachi, with stores in Bali and Australia. There were initial reports the accident was a hit-and-run, however, Bali police have not confirmed they are treating it as such. Family will be holding a fundraising event at Lacalaca Bali, a restaurant in Seminyak this coming Thursday and all proceeds from behind and bar and cash donations will go towards Nicho's medical expenses.

"Meadow Lea margarine and other signature Australian-owned brands, such as Helgas and Wonder White breads, could become the latest home-grown food products to be sold in to foreign hands after Asian investors bid $1.37 billion. The companies, owned by Goodman Fielder, could be moved offshore in as little as four months as the company board paves the way for Singapore oils trader Wilmar International and Hong Kong investment house First ­Pacific to enter into a takeover. Goodman Fielder owns and operates sugar refineries in North Queensland and Victoria, and the company employs about 6000 people in Australia, NZ and Asia. A company spokesman said it wasn't clear how many Australian-based jobs would be affected by the move. Australian entrepreneur Dick Smith says the looming take-over is a blow to the Australian home-grown food industry and customers who prefer to buy locally manufactured products. No longer: After 75 years in Australian hands the margarine spread on every Australian fridge shelf will soon be owned by Asian investors . A statement from Goodman Fielder released on Thursday said a recommendation had been put to its board to accept a takeover bid from the two Asian investors at 71 cents a share. Goodman Fielder has a portfolio of well-known consumer brands in some of Australia's largest grocery categories, including Meadow Lea, Praise, White Wings, Pampas, Mighty Soft, Helga's, Wonder White, Meadow Fresh and Irvines. If the buy-out proceeds, the once proudly-owned Australian food brands will join the long list of former iconic products Cottees Cordials, milk brands Dairy Farmers and Dare Iced Coffee, Bushells and Nerada Teas and big biscuit manufacturer Arnott's to fall into foreign hands.

Company Chairman Steve Gregg said the move would be a positive for the company's expansion into the Asian market. “We believe this revised proposal also demonstrates the strength of our underlying business andbrands but also the opportunity to leverage these assets to grow the business across the Asianregion.” Mr Smith said the growing sell-off of Australian-owned products into foreign hands leaves shoppers with almost next to no choice but to buy foreign-owned at the checkout. He said: 'Even the most patriotic consumers who want to buy Australian-made-and-Australian-owned find they increasingly don’t have a choice and the problem is becoming exponentially worse.' The buy-out will be subject to rigorous approvals, including a majority shareholder agreement and a Federal Court decision. XXXX beer is now a joint Australian Japanese-owned product .

"By . Adam Duggan . Major companies operating in Australia do not have measures in place to ensure their products are free from child labour or forced labour, a two-year investigation into the electronics industry has revealed. Some of the high-profile companies investigated that need to make improvements include Woolworths and Dick Smith Electronics. China-based Hisense and Australian-owned Palsonic fared the worst among the companies investigated, in a report from Baptist World Aid Australia. In the Electronics Industry Trend Report, Finland-based Nokia was rated the best in most categories. Despite coming under fire last year for their practices regarding child and forced labour in China, Apple sits fairly high on the rankings - being awarded a B+ overall . B+ - Nokia (only company to pay partial living wage), Apple, LG and Microsoft . B - Intel, HP, Motorola Mobility, Panasonic, Sanyo and Samsung . B- - Acer, Dell, Dell Alienware, Motorola Solutions, Olympus and Toshiba . C+ - Philips and Woolworths (AWA, Abode, Essentials and name-brand) C - Garmin, Hitachi, Sharp, Sony and TomTom . C- - Blackberry, IBM and Sandisk . D+ - Fujitsu . D - Amazon (Kindle), Dick Smith Electronics, HTC, Nintendo and Oracle . D- - Asus, Canon, Huawei, Kogan, Lenovo, Soniq and TEAC . F - Hisense and Palsonic . Companies were ranked based on their efforts to combat child exploitation and slavery in their supply chains. The report, released on Wednesday, provides a way for consumers to check up on the business practices of electronics companies, and chose who to buy from accordingly. It also allows companies to compare their practices with their peers. All of the 39 companies investigated have room for improvement, according to the reort, with 97 per cent of them unable to demonstrate they were paying their workers enough to cover basic needs. Only Nokia could hold its head high. Some companies, such as Apple, LG, and Microsoft, rated highly in the report - but none received a mark higher then B+. Companies such as Hisense and Palsonic - which scored an 'F' grade in all the ranked categories - are urged to raise their game. The industry as a whole was commended for knowing their suppliers at the final stage of production, with 49 per cent of the graded companies passing. Should prominent business owners be taking more responsibility? Dick Smith, who founded Dick Smith Electronics before selling it to Woolworths, and Ruslan Kogan, founder of Kogan electronics, are being called on to ensure more ethical practices among their supply chains . Exploitation and slavery:  In this ranking list, the companies were given a letter-grade, based on how well they addressed exploitation and slavery issues . But, at the raw materials level of the supply chain, none of the companies had complete knowledge of where their materials were sourced and only 18 per cent had partial knowledge. Baptist World Aid advocacy manager Gershon Nimbalker said: 'If companies don't know or don't care who is producing their products, it's much harder to know whether workers are being exploited or even enslaved.' Nokia was the only company that could demonstrate its code of conduct was making a difference for workers manufacturing their products, with collective bargaining agreements in place. Of the 39 companies, 34 per cent had codes of conduct that featured the right to collective bargaining. Mr Nimbalker said: 'The ability for workers in developing countries to organise and negotiate collectively is absolutely essential for balancing the bargaining power of employers. We commend Nokia for recognising this and putting it into practice.' Rescued child labourers in New Delhi, India (left), and just one of the products they are responsible for manufacturing. Luckily, Nokia (phone pictured right) treat their workers the fairest of all 39 companies included in the report . Of the major Australian retailers that also sell their own ranges of electronic goods, Woolworths (which stocks its own Abode, AWA, Essentials, and name-brand goods) did the best - managing to score a C+ overall. Dick Smith Electronics did only slightly worse, scoring a D. Fellow Australian electronics company Kogan sat just below Dick Smith, scoring a D- overall. Baptist World Australia hopes the report empowers consumers to take action. Mr Nimbalker said: 'We know that when consumers call for change, they have the power to transform the practices of companies, and through them the communities they work with. We’re excited about the impact this report will have. 'Workers in developing countries work long hours in often oppressive conditions to make the phones, TVs and tablets that we enjoy. The additional cost to ensure that they are rewarded for their efforts with a wage that is sufficient for them and their families to live is only a few dollars per product. 'By some estimates, as little as two to nine dollars per smart phone or less than 1.5 per cent of the total price.' Woolworths, Dick Smith Electronics, Kogan, Nokia, Apple, and Palsonic were unable to provide any comment.","Hisense and Palsonic were the worst offenders, while Nokia topped the list of companies investigated .

"By . Lillian Radulova . An abandoned Australian gold mine could help solve one of the great mysteries of the universe. The Stawell Gold Mine in Victoria is currently undergoing tests by The Centre of Excellence for Particle Physics (CoEPP) to determine if it would be suitable for an underground laboratory. If it is, the study of the 1,500-metre deep mine would focus entirely on locating and studying dark matter, and the laboratory would be the first of its kind in the southern hemisphere. The old Stawell Gold Mine could be the site of an underground laboratory for The Centre of Excellence for Particle Physics, which would search for dark matter . A deep underground mine is believed to house the perfect conditions for the identification of dark matter - which, if found, would be a world-first discovery - because the environment filters out other particles and cosmic rays which are present on the Earth's surface. More... Has the mystery of glowing Norwegian orbs been solved? Expert claims natural 'battery' creates the amazing light show . See the Northern Lights on Saturn: Astronomers capture best ever view of auroras and find phenomenon forms in same was as Earth's magnetic light show . CoEPP Director, Professor Geoffrey Taylor, said a laboratory in the Stawell Gold Mine could be used by researchers to determine exactly what dark matter consists of. While the existence of dark matter has been hypothesised for years, scientists are yet to identify and study it. 'There is probably four or five times more dark matter in the universe than what there is ordinary matter, which means there is still a huge amount of the universe which we don't know anything about,' he told The Age. Dark matter is thought to make up almost 95 per cent of the mass of the universe, yet scientists know very little about it . Scientists hope experiments using the Large Hadron Collider - the  world's most powerful particle collider - will help identify and unlock the mysteries of dark matter . Professor Elisabetta Barberio, of the University of Melbourne, said she hoped conditions inside the  abandoned mine shaft would be perfect for spotting dark matter. 'To search for [dark matter] we need to be in an environment that is very quiet and very dark, because if we would put our equipment on the surface of Earth, there would be so many particles coming from the sun, from the atmosphere, from even the galaxy that we call cosmic rays, that would disturb the measurement and we would be swamped by all these particles and we would miss the dark matter particle,' she told the ABC. Dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It . cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be . out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we . can see. The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates. 'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist. Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.' Scientists are fairly sure it exists, but they do not know what it looks like or . where to find it. The benefits of identifying dark matter are yet to be determined, but Professor Barberio is enthusiastic that advantages would soon be found. 'It's like the usual issues with fundamental science; at the beginning there are no applications,' she said. 'But if you look back to a little bit more than 100 years ago when they discovered the first elements of electricity and people didn't know what to do with it, eventually electricity is making most of our lives more comfortable.’ But even if the benefits of the research look as if they won't appear until the very distant future, the experiments, which hope to kick off in the next year or so, are likely to have benefits for the local economy. 'It would be the only facility nationally, Stawell would become a world leader,' Professor Taylor said. 'An underground laboratory with financial support, developed over many years would support technical skills and employment for engineers, electronics technicians, computer technicians etc.' The Stawell mine, 240kms from Melbourne, has been out of use since 2013 and is believed to house the perfect conditions for identifying dark matter .","The Stawell Gold Mine in Victoria is undergoing tests to determine if it would be suitable for an underground laboratory.
