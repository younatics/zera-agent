"Juba, Sudan (CNN) -- South Sudan took a seat at the world's table early Saturday as citizens of the new country took to the streets to celebrate. Cars rolled through the capital of Juba. Occupants waved flags and honked horns to celebrate sovereignty recognized Friday by Sudan. ""The Republic of the Sudan announces its acknowledgement of the establishment of the Republic of South Sudan as a sovereign state within the 1956 boundaries,"" announced Bakri Hassan Salih, minister for presidential affairs. The reference to the 1956 boundaries, however, was controversial because that puts the contested region of Abyei in the north. The region, the size of Connecticut, is home to the Ngok Dinka people, who are closely allied with the South, but it also serves as grazing grounds for northern Misseriya tribes. It was a battleground for decades in the brutal civil war fought between northern and southern forces. A referendum on whether the area should be part of the north or the South has been delayed over disagreement over who is eligible to vote. In recent weeks fighting has erupted in Abyei again, sparking fears of another war and marring preparations for the celebrations. The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to send up to 7,000 peacekeepers and 900 uniformed police to the new country of South Sudan. The mandate of the previous U.N. mission runs out Saturday with South Sudan's independence and the peacekeepers will be a part of a new operation for the global body. The Security Council is expected to meet again Wednesday to discuss U.N. membership for the new nation. In Juba, the mood was jubilant Friday, despite the bloodshed in Abyei and in oil-rich South Kordofan, a state in the north where many people are allied with the South. The airport was closed to commercial flights to allow for the arrival of expected dignitaries for the independence celebration. South Sudan natives voted overwhelmingly in January to secede. The referendum to split was part of a 2005 peace deal aimed at ending the decades of violence between the two sides. The two countries look set to divorce in name only. There are no agreements on the borders, the oil, or even the status of their respective citizens. But Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is still expected in Juba later Saturday, a gesture of pragmatism and what his office is calling a hope for brotherly relations. The South, in turn, is responding with equal grace, reserving for him an entrance separate from other dignitaries as the anthem of the Republic of Sudan plays on sovereign soil for the last time.","NEW: South Sudan becomes world's newest country .

"Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (CNN) -- In the heart of Kinshasa, the frenzied capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, classical music has found an unlikely band of heroes. Past the noisy, gritty markets and the cacophony of the city's congested streets, a large group of amateur local musicians has been defying adversity and challenges to bring musical harmony to one of Africa's most chaotic capitals. Passionate about the likes of Beethoven and Handel, the Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste is a musical ensemble of some 200 enthusiastic men and women, eager to make their voices heard and follow their dream of making classical music. ""I love music,"" says violin player Pauleth Masamba, who has been in the orchestra since 1995. ""It makes me feel good -- I can say music is one of the things that comforts me, takes off the stress and makes me happy."" Watch the orchestra perform Handel's Messiah . Yet, running such an orchestra in a city like Kinshasa is no easy task. Rehearsals usually take place in the late hours as most musicians have to work during the day to make a living. More often than not, power blackouts -- a regular occurrence in Kinshasa -- will bring the evening rehearsals to a temporary halt, prompting the musicians to put down their instruments and try to fix the problem. Read: Malian kora legend breaks music barriers . Another challenge the orchestra faces is a lack of practice space. When they are not practicing outdoors, musicians will often converge at the house of founder and conductor Armand Diangienda, which despite its large size cannot fit all of the group's members; quite often some of the choir's singers have to stand outside the rehearsal room, piling around open windows and doorways to make sure they are heard. But despite the constant logistical problems, the lack of resources and the limited funding, the Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste is constantly growing. ""This is a passion,"" says violin player Rodrick Muanda. ""That is why when we are here, we forget about everything else, we only think about music and nothing else."" Muanda says the members of the orchestra are united by their love of music. ""We're all musicians and we are so used to each other that we live like a family,"" he adds. ""We even call the orchestra the 'big symphonic family.'"" Read: Guitar hero of the desert . Self-taught musician Diangienda put together the orchestra some 20 years ago after he lost his job as an airline pilot. At the beginning, he says, people did not understand what he was trying to achieve. ""It is only after our concert in December of 1994 that people understood what we wanted to do, because then the orchestra was there in front of them,"" he remembers. ""What was extraordinary was that after the concert there were lots of people that came to register to be trained in music and to start playing in the orchestra. People were blown away -- it was something new in our community."" Diangienda says that when the orchestra started out they didn't have enough instruments to go around, so musicians often had to pool money together to buy used ones. They also had to figure out a way to fix broken instruments, or even build them from scratch. ""We tried to find substitutions for some instruments"" he says. ""For example, we didn't have a place where we could buy strings, so we used bicycle cable for the strings. ""So many times also we tried to fix ourselves some instruments and also I remember one day I was with a friend, I told him, 'Why must we buy instruments? Can we try to build a cello or double bass?' So we tried to do this."" Read: Street musicians unite world through songs . In 2010, a German documentary brought international attention to the group, as well as bringing additional funding and support. Called ""Kinshasa Symphony,"" the film captured the musicians' remarkable musical talent and resilient spirit in the face of daily challenges. ""The passion is there and that has allowed us to go above the difficulties,"" says Diangienda. ""The symphony orchestra has brought us a form of discipline, something new that allows each one of us to bring a contribution in what we were doing."" Every now and then the orchestra holds free concerts in Kinshasa, aimed at inspiring a new generation of musicians and enabling more people to discover the work of classical composers. ""Up to now, this style of music is still foreign to people here,"" explains Diangienda. ""Some people feel it's Western music but we say it's not -- it's an expression for us of our own culture."" Diangienda says that another reason for the concerts is to show people in the DRC that music can be appreciated in a different way from the one they're used to. ""Here in our country, music is listened to so that you can dance,"" he explains. ""It is very rare that it is listened to just for meditation but I think classical music takes you really far. ""It allows you to meditate and express certain things that you might not be able to express with other style of music."" Ultimately, Diangienda says his biggest dream is to create a music school that will enable local musicians to export the country's rich culture through classical music. ""I believe that kids growing up with this music and their Congolese culture will be able to express themselves better than us tomorrow,"" he says. ""They'll do symphonies or sonatas which will be classical but completely African. That is my biggest dream, to create a music school where kids will learn how to play instruments and adults will be able to learn as well.""

"(CNN) -- The European Union won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday as it grapples with the worst crisis since its founding -- devastating debt and the threat of disintegration. The prestigious award was a salute to the struggling 27-nation union for its work in promoting democracy and reconciliation since World War II. It was a cheer for an entity tackling the continent's economic misery -- particularly in debt-ridden Greece, Spain, and Portugal -- as some member countries might be faced with dropping the euro, the EU currency. The timing wasn't a coincidence. ""This is, in a way, a message to Europe that we should do everything we can and move forward,"" said Thorbjen Jagland, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and a high European Council official. ""We want to remind all Europeans about what we have achieved on this continent and that we should not let it start disintegrating again and getting nationalism and extremism (to) grow on this continent, because we know what that leads to,"" Jagland said. ""It's also a clear message to other parts of the world where you have a number of conflicts; this is a good way of solving conflicts, namely getting countries (to) make trade with each other. ..."" The committee had ""no ambitions"" to save the euro, Jagland said, and ""we don't have a position on how to solve the economic crisis."" Nobel prize winner: Literature . But he stressed the importance of finding a solution to the EU debt crisis. Others echoed support for the EU. The International Crisis Group, an organization committed to preventing conflict, said it is important to remember ""historical perspective"" during a period ""when the EU is under tremendous day-to-day strain."" ""The EU has been, above all else, one of the greatest conflict resolution mechanisms ever devised."" European economic troubles have reverberated across the world. The problems have hit American pocketbooks because of the billions of dollars in U.S. trade and investment in Europe. Within the EU, disparities have persisted between economically strong members, such as Germany, which has fronted European bailout money, and economically weaker countries like Greece suffering from strict austerity measures and unemployment. The longstanding animosities erupted Tuesday in Greece during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. As many as 25,000 people angry about EU austerity measures championed by Germany took to the streets to protest. In its announcement, the Nobel Committee said that the EU ""for over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe."" Jagland singled out the peaceful reconciliation between Germany and France -- an amity forged between neighbors who fought each other last century. ""Since 1945, that reconciliation has become a reality,"" the committee said in a statement. ""Today, war between Germany and France is unthinkable."" The committee also focused on the spread of democracy to newer member nations. ""In the 1980s, Greece, Spain and Portugal joined the EU. The introduction of democracy was a condition for their membership,"" the committee said. All three countries saw dictatorships in the 20th century, even after World War II. It cited progress in peace made by EU candidate nations, such as the former Yugoslav republics. ""We have to keep in mind that there are not so many years ago since people on this part of Europe killed each other -- awful wars,"" Jagland said, referring to the warfare in Bosnia, Kosovo and Croatia. Jagland is the current secretary general of the Council of Europe and a former prime minster of Norway, which is not an EU member and where sentiment against membership runs high. The announcement, made in Oslo, Norway, drew some moans. Nobel Prize winners: Chemistry . Journalists asked in Norwegian and English how the Nobel honors would affect any future decision by Norway to join the EU. ""This no argument in any direction for what Norway should do, and I don't think it will affect the public opinion in Norway right now,"" Jagland answered. ""It is at an all-time low,"" he said. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barosso received news of the award ""with great emotion"" and called it ""a great honor for all 500 million citizens of Europe, for all the member states and all the European institutions."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Nobel Committee ""acknowledges the idea of the European conciliation"" and said the euro is more than a currency. ""We should not forget this -- in particular during these weeks and months, in which we are working to strengthen the euro."" ""Six decades of peace in Europe: For those of us who live in the European Union, that's a long period of time,"" Merkel added. ""It's merely the blink of an eye in the course of history, which is why we must never forget that we must again and again work, strain and strive for this peace, for democracy, for freedom."" Nobel Prize winners: Physics . Italians in Rome rallying Friday against government cuts to public education weighed in. One woman said the prize appears to be a ""hope for the future."" Another woman said she was pleased but a bit surprised because the EU could have made stronger commitments to peace. And a man said the European economy is no longer ""for the people."" ""We are the economy that works in favor of the banks,"" he said. This year's winner was picked from 231 different nominations -- 43 for organizations and the rest for individuals, the Nobel Committee said. Last year's peace prize came as a surprise to many observers, split as it was among three women: Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and grassroots activist Leymah Gbowee, and Yemeni media freedom campaigner Tawakkul Karman, a symbol of the Arab Spring. Johnson Sirleaf is one of many heads of state to have received the prize, including four U.S. presidents: Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama. The Peace Prize is the fifth Nobel Prize to be awarded this week, preceded by honors in medicine, physics, chemistry and literature. Other large organizations have won the Nobel Peace Prize, including the United Nations, Doctors Without Borders, U.N. peacekeeping forces, the U.N. atomic energy agency and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.

"(CNN) -- ""Vote as if your life depends on it."" Those are the final words of an ominous new Web video that features footage of an American flag being burned and attacks President Barack Obama, saying he is ""willfully blind to the threats we face.""

"(CNN) -- I met Dr. Doug Stein while making a documentary about my own complex journey through fatherhood. His vasectomy missions to Third World countries inspired me to launch both a movement and to become his 25,000th client. I have made many films around the world about angry and alienated men who, lacking positive ways to express their innate power and potential, inflict brutality on women and children. In contrast, observing men on the day they make a conscious choice to exit the gene pool reveals the sex's vulnerability and thoughtfulness. To transform this positive choice into a global movement, Stein and I created the first World Vasectomy Day in 2013 -- and set out to inspire 100 doctors in 25 countries to do 1,000 vasectomies. From a medical perspective, a vasectomy is a simple procedure that takes about 15 minutes. The doctor severs the vas deferens and then seals up both ends, thus preventing sperm from reaching your semen. It has a less than 1% failure rate, compared with 18% for condoms, making it an important option for men whose families are complete. And yet, even though modern techniques require neither needle nor scalpel, and for the vast majority of men it takes only a few days to recover, it's still a tough sell. Yes, there are places, like New Zealand, where 20% of men choose vasectomies, but there are countries where the rate is less than 1%. But if ease and effectiveness don't convince a man of the benefits of vasectomy, there are many compelling sociological and health reasons as well. For example, 51% of pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and these pregnancies come with adverse maternal and child health outcomes, such as delayed prenatal care and an increased risk of premature birth. Poverty and family are also correlated, with double the incidence of poverty in nine-member households than in four-member households. And with all the controversy surrounding abortion, there's no better way to avoid one than a vasectomy. Sadly, while men waffle on the sidelines, more than 300 million women have had tubal ligations -- six times the number of men having vasectomies, even though tubal ligations are more invasive, costly and risky. While both procedures are almost equally effective, tubal failures can result in ectopic pregnancies, a leading cause of maternal mortality. With all these reasons, you'd think for men who no longer wish to have children choosing a family planning option that is permanent, safe and secure would be a no-brainer. But if logic, guilt or fairness did the trick, we'd be living on a planet much further away than Mars. The Swahili language uses the same word for ""vasectomy"" and ""castration"" and that sums up what so many men believe. And it's not just men. Many women would agree with a friend of mine, who once suggested vasectomies change a man's status from alpha male to alpha-lite. Fear and good information might get a man to wear a condom, but World Vasectomy Day needed compelling stories and there was no shortage of them. There were men who traveled hundreds of miles to have the procedure for their wives, and those who did it to help their children emerge from poverty. These men, who rise up and shoulder responsibility for family planning -- although still the minority -- serve as our inspiration. In my travels, I met men in their 20s who know they don't want children and men in their 70s who do. There was an Iraq War veteran who asked, ""Why am I considered old enough to die or kill for my country, but not old enough to decide about children?"" These are tough questions. Stein suggested he preserve some sperm. On World Vasectomy Day, we don't decide who should or should not get a vasectomy, but we do insist that it be voluntary. We acknowledge there is a small chance that a vasectomy can cause long lasting pain, and we certainly have great sympathy for these men. A recent study also suggests a possible link between prostate cancer and vasectomies. It's important to note that there are many other studies that suggest otherwise. The bottom line is that all methods of birth control come with some element of risk. The unfair part is that it's women who take it on almost exclusively for one third of their lives. For all our efforts to inspire men, it wasn't until we empowered the urologists and vasectomists who perform these procedures that our movement took off. Providing vasectomies is not easy or always accepted, but on Friday, there will be approximately 300 skilled doctors from 30 countries participating in what will be the largest male-oriented family planning event in history. What we learned in creating World Vasectomy Day bodes well for our future. Men reveal the best of who we are when we work together to serve a greater purpose, one that honors ourselves, our families and our future. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author.","A doctor and filmmaker team up to create World Vasectomy Day .

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. called his lawyer Monday night to come back to prison and pick him up. He said his early entry into the facility was being held up by an administrative issue, according to his attorney, CK Hoffler. She told reporters Tuesday in Atlanta that Jackson, once a rising Democratic star and son of the famous civil rights figure, wasn't trying to duck the media by sneaking into prison early. He just figured the sooner he started his 30-month sentence, the sooner he would be able to get back to his family, Hoffler said. Confusion arose when Hoffler's office issued a news release on Monday evening saying Jackson had reported to prison in North Carolina. The statement included his prisoner number. But prison officials said Jackson didn't become a prisoner until Tuesday morning. Hoffler said she and North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield accompanied Jackson to the prison and were there when he reported. But they left, and Hoffler headed to the airport to catch a flight back to Atlanta. Jackson called her and told her he wouldn't be admitted that night. She came back and took him to a hotel. They re-reported at 10 a.m. A Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesman said Tuesday that Jackson, whose political career imploded over the use of campaign finances to support lavish personal spending, entered a federal prison camp in Butner. The former Illinois congressman had been ordered to report to a federal prison camp or correctional institution no earlier than November 1. Hoffler said his legal team communicated with the bureau of prisons to let officials know Jackson wanted to come early. She didn't specify what method of communication was used. She drove Jackson from Washington on Sunday and took him to the prison on Monday evening. ""He didn't just show up early,"" she told reporters. ""It was our understanding and it still is that he would have been able to report early -- and ultimately he did."" Jackson, 48, was sentenced in August to 30 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to misuse of $750,000 in campaign funds, money that went to personal expenses like vacations, fur coats and movie memorabilia. His wife, Sandra Jackson, pleaded guilty to filing false tax returns that failed to account for hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxable income. She was sentenced to 12 months in prison. Jackson has promised to pay $200,000 toward his $750,000 fraud judgment by November 1, according to court documents. Filed last week, the documents show that Jackson has so far been unable to meet his financial obligations in the judgment and has promised to sell a property he owns in Washington in order to start paying it off. The filing requests that Jackson be given until June 2014 to pay the full amount. He will need to submit a status report by mid-May. The property Jackson is promising to sell is in Washington's costly Dupont Circle neighborhood. Jackson could also be forced to sell a property in Chicago.

"Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday rejected a GOP call to resign, telling a heated Senate hearing that Republicans were trying to score political points instead of addressing significant issues. Under attack from the outset by Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Holder rejected accusations he was stonewalling congressional investigators on the botched ""Fast and Furious"" gunrunning sting operation and failing to investigate recent leaks of classified information properly. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, leveled the harshest criticism, accusing Holder of misleading Congress over what he and other top Justice Department officials knew about the Fast and Furious program and refusing to appoint a special counsel to investigate leaked national security details in recent media reports. Holder rested his head on one hand as Cornyn recited a litany of allegations involving the attorney general's performance. ""I'm afraid we've come to an impasse,"" Cornyn said, adding that Holder ""violated the public trust"" in his view. ""With regret, you've left me with no choice but to join those who call for you to resign your office."" Holder responded by calling Cornyn's list of allegations ""almost breathtaking in its inaccuracy"" and said: ""I don't have any intention of resigning."" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that President Barack Obama maintains ""absolute confidence"" in the attorney general, which Holder noted Tuesday. Regarding congressional demands for Fast and Furious documents, including a House committee that plans to take up a contempt measure against Holder next week, the attorney general said good-faith efforts to work with the House panel have failed to reach a deal. ""The desire here is not for accommodation but for political point-making,"" Holder said, calling such behavior ""the thing that turns people off about Washington."" In what appeared to be a coordinated move, Republicans, led by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, introduced a resolution Tuesday supporting the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the classified leaks. McCain: Obama responsible for leaks . At the Judiciary Committee hearing, Republican senators said Holder's decision to appoint two U.S. attorneys to investigate, rather than a special counsel, failed to address the seriousness of the violations and represented a Democratic double standard. The issue sparked angry exchanges between senators, with Chairman Pat Leahy of Vermont and Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, both Democrats, taking issue with arguments by Cornyn and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, that Holder was acting improperly. In response to Democratic support for Holder on the classified leaks investigation, Graham shot back: ""If the shoe was on the other foot, you and everyone else on the other side would be crying to high heaven to appoint a special prosecutor that all of us could buy into."" Graham noted that as senators, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had called for the appointment of a special counsel in past situations that involved Republican transgressions, such as White House leaks in the Valerie Plame case that revealed the identity of the CIA operative. Senate breaks filibuster of Obama court pick . The current leaks were more serious, Graham argued, and Holder should do now what Obama and Biden had called for then. However, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee and is a member of the judiciary panel, repeated her past contention that a special counsel's investigation would take too long to deal with the immediate threat from classified leaks. She said she would oppose the McCain resolution, adding that Holder took the right step in naming two U.S. attorneys to investigate in addition to the FBI probe already under way. Holder told the committee that both he and FBI Director Robert Mueller had been interviewed ""because we were people who had knowledge of these matters, and we wanted to make sure that with regard to the investigation, that it began with us."" Describing his experience as ""a serious interview that was done by some serious FBI agents,"" Holder said he believed about 100 interviews had been conducted so far. Holder earlier offered to negotiate with congressional leaders on turning over documents involving Fast and Furious to avoid what he said could become a constitutional crisis. He later modified his characterization of the problem to a possible constitutional conflict. ""I am prepared to make compromises with regard to the documents to be made available,"" Holder said. At the same time, Holder said congressional Republicans must be open to working out an agreement. ""I've got to have a willing partner,"" Holder said. ""I've extended my hand, and I'm waiting to hear back."" The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will consider the contempt measure against Holder on June 20, a panel statement said Monday. A vote by the panel could occur that day, and the measure would then require approval from the full chamber. Monday's announcement escalated a high-stakes, election-year face-off over what Republicans said is Holder's failure to respond to a subpoena for Justice Department documents on the botched operation. Could Congress go from bad to worse? The department has acknowledged the program, which allowed illegally purchased guns to ""walk"" across the border into Mexico, was badly flawed. Such sting operations have now been prohibited. The department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which lost track of more than 1,000 firearms after they crossed the border, found itself under fire when two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010. Terry's family has been among critics of the Justice Department's handling of the case. On Tuesday, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, raised the matter in his opening statement and again in direct questioning of Holder, noting that questions remain almost a year after three whistle-blowers testified before the House Oversight and Goverment Reform Committee about gunrunning. ""Here we are, one year later, and the Terry family is still waiting for answers. They're still waiting for justice,"" Grassley said, noting assertions by House Republicans that sealed requests for wiretaps under the Fast and Furious program showed top Justice Department officials knew about the questionable operation long before so far acknowledged. Holder repeated what he told a House committee last week -- that he read the affidavits and summaries and found no incriminating information. ""You reach conclusions on the basis of hindsight,"" Holder said. ""I try to put myself in the place of people actually looking at the material at the time."" Holder has testified at eight congressional hearings on Operation Fast and Furious, and he has consistently maintained that he knew nothing about the flawed tactics until early last year. The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, said Monday that the panel wants documents that explain why Holder and the Justice Department decided months later to retract a February 4, 2011, letter to Congress that denied any knowledge by senior officials of improper tactics in the gunrunning sting. The Justice Department slammed the House committee's Monday announcement, calling it ""unfortunate and unwarranted."" ""From the beginning, Chairman Issa has distorted the facts, ignored testimony and flung inaccurate accusations at the attorney general and others, and this latest move fits within that tired political playbook that has so many Americans disillusioned with Washington,"" said spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler. Both Issa and the Justice Department statement said a resolution still could be reached to avoid the contempt measure. Last week, Holder assigned Ronald C. Machen Jr., U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and a Democratic appointee, and Rod J. Rosenstein, U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland and a holdover GOP appointee, to lead the investigations into the alleged leaks. McCain and other Republicans are insisting on a special counsel, contending that investigators within the system would face a conflict of interest in pursuing top government officials. A recent report in The New York Times provided classified details of what it described as a U.S cyberattack targeting Iran's nuclear centrifuge program sparked the bipartisan outrage. Other recent possible leaks of classified information included details on the administration's efforts to expand its drone program and Obama's involvement in ""kill lists"" against militants in Yemen and Pakistan. The public airing of details surrounding a recently disrupted bomb plot in Yemen by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula also angered intelligence and national security officials. Republicans noted that some articles cited sources who took part in White House meetings, which they said showed that leaks were coming from administration officials. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, repeatedly asked Holder how two U.S. attorneys could effectively investigate top national security issues involved in White House meetings cited. Holder insisted the attorneys he named were dogged prosecutors who would follow any lead, no matter where it took them. Obama has strongly rejected claims that his White House has deliberately leaked secrets to the media, saying the idea was ""offensive"" and would put Americans at risk. Graham, however, said Tuesday that the pattern of the administration was to be uncooperative on issues that might embarrass it -- such as Fast and Furious and now the classified leaks. Holder responded the administration has prosecuted classified leaks more than any previous administration. CNN's Ted Barrett and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: GOP Sen.

"(CNN) -- Thirty years ago, the United States enacted a law that has inadvertently condemned hundreds of thousands of Americans to death. As a result of the National Organ Transplant Act, more Americans have lost their lives waiting for an organ than died in both World Wars, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq put together. The law bans almost any payment to living organ donors. Recipients themselves can reimburse donors' travel, lodging, and lost wages, which helps, when they have the money -- but not when they don't. Most people who are living donors give to a family member or friend, but the financial hardships are considerable and people are regularly denied permission to donate because they don't have enough financial resources. I was denied for that reason when I wanted to donate an organ to save a friend's life. With four kids in college, there was not enough ready cash to donate. And it was against the law for my friend or anyone else to help me with the $10,000 or more expenses I had above and beyond travel, lodging, and lost wages. I had passed all medical and psychological tests, yet the living donor coordinator at the transplant center denied our match. My friend died. Researching the issue I realized I wasn't alone -- most Americans can't afford to donate without considerable financial hardship to themselves and their families. Expenses that can't be reimbursed include things like travel costs for a spouse to come along and take care of the donor, that spouse's lost wages, child-care, household responsibilities and lost income not measurable in wages, such as business income or farm income. Giving an organ costs on average $5,000, but can be as much as $20,000. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, in 2013, 20% of American households had no discretionary funds at all, and only 8% could afford to donate an organ at a cost of more than $5,000 without dipping into their savings or going into debt. In 1983, 10,000 Americans were waiting for a transplant. Today, the number is more than 120,000, of whom 100,000 need kidneys. At least 400,000 Americans are on some kind of dialysis, many of whom might once have benefited from a transplant, but are now too sick to qualify, or never tried because the odds of securing an organ are so poor. We desperately need to find a way to compensate living donors for their costs. By enabling the government and private charities to cover all of a donor's expenses as they come up, we would eliminate the lure of fast money, and ensure that people can actually afford to save others' lives when they are willing. In 2011, the government implemented a debit card system enabling people to cover the costs of recovering from natural disasters without having to incur debt. We could apply the same system to help organ donors cover their costs. In 2013, there were 5,990 living American organ donors. If we doubled that rate, we could save over 50,000 lives in the first five years alone. And to top if off, by reducing the need for dialysis -- which is both expensive and a living death for most kidney disease patients -- it would save Medicare money. Very few people who come forward agreeing to donate realize that there is a financial sacrifice until they get well into the process. A 2006 article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal reported a study in one hospital where almost one in four patients' relatives changed their minds about donating an organ because it was too expensive. (Canada has similar restrictions on compensating donors as the United States.) The Transplant Act applies to all major organs, tissues, and bone marrow, but the ban on compensating most expenses hurts those Americans who need kidneys, livers, and bone marrow most. These are all patients who can be helped by living donors, and together they constitute more than 90% of Americans waiting for transplants. But according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, only 15% of Americans waiting for a kidney, for example, will receive one. Even if all Americans were to check the organ donor box on their driver's licenses, a 2003 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that only about 1% of people die under conditions that allow them to donate their organs -- the rest are too sick, too injured, or too far from a hospital when they die for their organs to be of use. Thirty years ago, the Transplant Act resulted from quite understandable revulsion at a proposal by Dr. H. Barry Jacobs that the government pay people to come to the U.S. to donate their kidneys. The government, Jacobs figured, could spend relatively little compensating such donors -- maybe only $1,000 per kidney -- and then send them on their way. The prospect of the United States shipping thousands of impoverished people here from developing nations so that rich Americans could harvest their kidneys reads like the plot of a science fiction novel. Both Democrats and Republicans rightly fear that reforming the law too dramatically could encourage poor and at-risk populations to sell their organs in exchange for quick cash. Unfortunately, Congress has allowed the pendulum to swing too far in the other direction. By banning almost all compensation to living donors, the government has ensured that only the wealthiest and their friends can afford the costs of donating, while hundreds of thousands of other Americans suffer and die. The original intention of the Transplant Act was to help those in the greatest medical need first. Congress could still enact reforms consistent with that intention. It could allow UNOS, with the help of federal funds, to pay donation-related expenses for Americans willing to help those who are at the top of the waiting list. And it could enable recipients and charities to support donors who helped any patient who needed a transplant. These measures together would assure that government funds went to those closest to dying, and allow non-government funds to cover donor expenses for anyone anywhere on the list. Thirty years ago, the representatives who passed the Transplant Act were unquestionably right to forbid rich Americans from exploiting people from developing countries by trafficking in organs. But they were wrong to forbid helping American organ donors with legitimate expenses. Now, as then, living organ donors make heroic sacrifices to give life to others. We need to do anything we can to help them do that. By striking a new compromise we can save thousands of American lives.","More died waiting for an organ than in WWI and II, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Parliamentary processes in state legislatures don't offer too many moments of genuine excitement, but on Tuesday night we saw one in Texas, as state Sen. Wendy Davis mounted a successful old-school, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington-style filibuster to stop a bill dramatically restricting women's access to abortion in our second-largest state. It featured accusations and recriminations, aching feet in pink tennis shoes, shenanigans over the time stamp on the bill, and an angry crowd. This rare episode offers us an important illustration of where politics is in America today, and where it will be for some time to come. To simplify things a bit: The Republican party is in retreat, yet more aggressive than ever. The culture war will never die. And for all Americans' supposed disgust with party polarization, the people we elect are doing pretty much what the voters ask them to. When Republicans won sweeping victories at the state level in the 2010 elections, they decided that they should use every ounce of power they had to remake the states they control. Those Northeasterners might be passing marriage equality and expanding health insurance, but in the red states it was a different story. They rolled out bills to cut taxes for the wealthy and increase them for the poor, to make it harder for people to vote, and to reject the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (which meant keeping their poor populations without health insurance, even though the federal government would pick up the tab). Perry renews Texas abortion battle with special session . They also went after abortion rights with particular zeal. No fewer than 92 state laws restricting abortion were passed in 2011, the year after the Republican victories; last year another 43 such laws were added to the books. Nationally, the GOP is in the doldrums, disliked by young people and growing minority groups, and with an increasingly unpopular agenda. But where they have power, they're making the most of it. The depressing truth is that despite Wendy Davis' heroic feat of vertical endurance (the strange rules of Texas filibusters forbid one from even leaning on something, let alone sitting down or taking a bathroom break), when the Texas legislature comes back for its next session, Republicans are likely to pass this bill or something like it again. Perhaps they'll be given pause by all the attention garnered by this controversy over the last couple of days. But probably not, because the legislators are true believers. They're not waging war on women's rights because they think it will get them a few extra votes, they're doing it because it's what they believe. When the House of Representatives in Washington passes a ban on abortions after 20 weeks, it's nothing more than an impotent legislative outburst. Just like the 37 times the House has voted to repeal Obamacare, it knew its bill would never pass the Senate or get the president's signature. Representatives did it to make themselves feel better, maybe blow off some steam. But at the state level, Republicans have real power, which means women and minorities and the poor suffer. Just this week, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, giving states in the South freedom to enact new restrictions that could enhance the power white voters have at the ballot box. But the court also struck down the Defense of Marriage Act and effectively killed California's Proposition 8, making gay people's lives a little easier, particularly where they're now allowed to marry. The result will likely be that red states will get redder and blue states bluer. Some people mocked Barack Obama for arguing in 2008 that he could bring Republicans and Democrats together to transcend party divisions. What most forget is that George W. Bush made exactly the same promise in 2000 (""I don't have enemies to fight,"" he said in his convention speech. ""And I have no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years. I want to change the tone of Washington to one of civility and respect.""). Bill Clinton said the same thing in 1992. None of them succeeded, and it doesn't seem like that unity is in the offing any time soon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Waldman.","Paul Waldman: Sen. Wendy Davis' filibuster over abortion bill a rare look into state of politics .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian protesters threw tomatoes and shoes at U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's motorcade Sunday and shouted, ""Monica, Monica, Monica"" as she left the newly reopened U.S. Consulate in Alexandria. Clinton said she was in the city to answer critics who believe Washington has taken sides in Egyptian politics. There were already vocal protesters at the start of her visit to the consulate, forcing the ceremony to be moved inside. ""I want to be clear that the United States is not in the business, in Egypt, of choosing winners and losers, even if we could, which, of course, we cannot,"" Clinton said at the ceremony to reopen the consulate, which was closed in 1993 because of budget constraints. Son of kidnapped American: Dad didn't know of danger . ""I have come to Alexandria to reaffirm the strong support of the United States for the Egyptian people and for their democratic future."" The protesters threw the tomatoes, shoes and a water bottle as the staff walked to their vans after the ceremony and riot police had to hold back the crowd. A tomato hit an Egyptian official in the face. Clinton's van was around the corner from the protesters, and a senior State Department official said her car was not hit. The chants of ""Monica"" refer to Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern who had an affair with Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton. Earlier Sunday, Clinton held a closed-door meeting with the head of Egypt's military leadership, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, whose military council is in a political tug of war with new President Mohamed Morsy. Opinion: Does U.S. matter anymore in Egypt and Israel? Egypt's military leaders took control of the government after a popular uprising toppled former President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011, promising to hand over control after elections. But after this year's elections, the military council issued a decree stripping the presidency of much of its power. And more than two weeks after Morsy took office, the country remains in the throes of domestic political chaos. The president has no Cabinet and the country has no parliament. Clinton met with Morsy on Saturday and urged him to assert the ""full authority"" of his office. She stressed that it is up to the Egyptian people to shape the country's political future, but also said the United States would work ""to support the military's return to a purely national security role."" Clinton and Tantawi, who met for just over an hour Sunday, discussed the political transition and the military ruling council's ongoing dialogue with Morsy, said a senior State Department official, who described the meeting on condition of anonymity. Later Sunday, in meetings with representatives from civil society groups and Christian leaders, Clinton addressed concerns from some who have been skeptical of the United States' neutrality in Egypt's political transition, another senior State Department official said. ""There has been some suspicion, some assertion, and we heard some of that today, that somehow the U.S. has put its finger on the scale in favor of one side or another in this transition,"" the official said. ""And she wanted in very, very clear terms, particularly with the Christian group this morning, to dispel that notion and to make clear that only Egyptians can choose their leaders, that we have not supported any candidate, any party, and we will not."" As she left the country Sunday night, Clinton said her two days of meetings showed her the Egyptian people ""have legitimate concerns, and I will be honest and say they have legitimate fears about their future."" Egypt's fragile economy has been a top item on Clinton's agenda during the trip. The secretary of state also met with business entrepreneurs affiliated with Flat6Labs, an organization that provides seed money, mentoring and work space to small Egyptian companies to help them realize their concepts. ""Thanks to all of you for being willing to take a risk,"" she said. Clinton aides said the secretary of state wanted to visit Cairo early after Morsy's swearing-in to show that the Obama administration wants to help the new government improve Egypt's economy. In meetings with Morsy and Tantawi, Clinton discussed a U.S. economic package that would relieve as much as $1 billion in Egyptian debt and help foster innovation, growth and job creation, officials said. She also said the United States is ready to make available $250 million in loan guarantees to Egyptian businesses. Tantawi told Clinton that what Egyptians need most now is help getting the economy back on track, one senior State Department official said. Egypt's military is the foundation of the modern state, having overthrown the country's monarchy in 1952. Tantawi, a 76-year-old career infantry officer, fought in Egypt's 1956, 1967 and 1973 wars with Israel. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which Tantawi heads, currently wields legislative power, having ordered the dissolution of parliament after the country's highest court ruled that it had been elected under invalid laws. Morsy tried to call it back into session after he was sworn in, but the court reaffirmed its decision, so the military council retains lawmaking powers until a new parliament is sworn in near the end of the year. In the presidential election, Morsy edged out Ahmed Shafik -- the last prime minister under Mubarak -- winning nearly 52% of the votes cast. He resigned from the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party shortly after the results were announced, in an apparent effort to send a message that he will represent all Egyptians.","Protesters pelt Clinton's motorcade with tomatoes and shoes .

"Washington (CNN) -- Yet another Bush family member is weighing in on whether or not former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush will run for president in 2016. ""I think it's more than likely that he's giving this a serious thought in moving forward,"" his eldest son, George P. Bush, told ABC on Sunday. ""If you had asked me a few years back, I would've said it was less likely,"" said Bush, who himself is running for political office for the first time as Texas land commissioner. ""The family will be behind him 100% if he decides to do it."" George P. Bush is the fourth member of his father's immediate family to weigh in publicly on his dad's potential candidacy. And while he says he thinks his father is ""still assessing it,"" other members of the family have not been shy about publicly pressuring Jeb Bush to consider a bid. Earlier this month, his older brother, former President George W. Bush, told Fox News that he thinks ""he (his brother) wants to be president."" ""He and I did have a conversation. I of course was pushing him to run for president. He of course was saying, 'I haven't made up my mind,'"" Bush 43 said in the Fox News interview. ""He's seen his dad, he's seen his brother. And so he's a very thoughtful man and he's -- he's weighing his options."" In April, Jeb Bush's younger brother Neil said their father, former president George H. W. Bush, also endorsed the idea. ""If you asked Dad the same question -- 'Should Jeb run?' -- he'd say yes,"" Neil Bush said in an interview with CNN's Gloria Borger. ""Yeah, he would say yeah."" But not every member of the Republican family is on board with another Bush running for a seat in the Oval Office. Before the men in the family had begun floating the idea, former first lady Barbara Bush dismissed the notion, suggesting that her family has had its turn governing the country. ""I think this is a great American country, great country. And if we can't find more than two or three families to run for high office, that's silly, because there are great governors and great eligible people to run,"" she said. While the former first lady acknowledged that her son is undoubtedly qualified for the role, she did admit, ""I hope he won't."" ""I think he'll get all my enemies (and) all his brother's,"" Barbara Bush told PBS in January. ""And there are other families. I refuse to accept that this great country isn't raising other wonderful people."" Despite all of the public clamor surrounding Jeb Bush's potential candidacy, his son Jeb Bush Jr. admitted that the question hasn't surfaced during family gatherings, although the issue is ""the 800-pound gorilla in the room.'' ""A lot of people are waiting to see what Dad does,'' Bush said in an interview Thursday with The Wall Street Journal. ""There's a lot of pressure to run."" Jeb Bush has not been shy about discussing the prospect of a campaign with some of the most important influencers in the hypothetical race. Earlier this week, Bush was bombarded with questions about a possible run when he met with donors and business leaders in South Carolina, multiple sources at the meeting told CNN. And while his early visit to a swing state is notable, his travel circuit around the country to raise money for GOP hopefuls in competitive races is also telling. Last week, Bush stumped in Michigan for Terri Lynn Land, who faces a closely watched race against sitting Rep. Gary Peters. In September, he attended fund-raisers for struggling incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts in Kansas, gubernatorial hopeful Bruce Rauner in Illinois, and in Florida for Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. This week, Bush will travel to Colorado -- another swing state -- to campaign for Senate hopeful Rep. Cory Gardner, who faces a tight contest with sitting Sen. Mark Udall.","George P.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Saturday called for bipartisan legislation to extend unemployment insurance, an all-important benefit for the longtime out-of-work. ""Just a few days after Christmas, more than 1 million of our fellow Americans lost a vital economic lifeline -- the temporary insurance that helps folks make ends meet while they look for a job,"" Obama said in his weekly address. ""Republicans in Congress went home for the holidays and let that lifeline expire. And for many of their constituents who are unemployed through no fault of their own, that decision will leave them with no income at all."" The insurance expired last week when lawmakers failed to continue a 2008 recession-era federal law providing nearly a year of benefits, paid for by U.S. taxpayers, that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out. Congress will start the new year with an old fight: whether to extend jobless benefits for 1.3 million long-term unemployed. Obama urged lawmakers to restore the benefits. ""Right now, a bipartisan group in Congress is working on a three-month extension of unemployment insurance -- and if they pass it, I will sign it. For decades, Republicans and Democrats put partisanship and ideology aside to offer some security for job-seekers, even when the unemployment rate was lower than it is today. Instead of punishing families who can least afford it, Republicans should make it their New Year's resolution to do the right thing, and restore this vital economic security for their constituents right now,"" Obama said. Democrats argue the program is needed to sustain economic recovery and offer a lifeline to those struggling to keep their heads above water financially. Republicans counter the benefits are an economic drain and a disincentive to looking for work. The Congressional Budget Office estimates continuing them for another year will cost about $26 billion. Many Republicans, including potential 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, have long insisted that the Great Recession-era extension of emergency federal benefits deters job hunting and is unnecessary as the economy rebounds and unemployment declines. Obama said denial of the security provided by the benefits ""is just plain cruel."" ""We're a better country than that. We don't abandon our fellow Americans when times get tough -- we keep the faith with them until they start that new job,"" he said. ""What's more, it actually slows down the economy for all of us. If folks can't pay their bills or buy the basics, like food and clothes, local businesses take a hit and hire fewer workers. That's why the independent Congressional Budget Office says that unless Congress restores this insurance, we'll feel a drag on our economic growth this year. And after our businesses created more than 2 million new jobs last year, that's a self-inflicted wound we don't need,"" Obama said. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, plans to hold the first vote toward renewing the benefits on Monday, the day the Senate returns from its holiday recess. It will be a procedural test of a proposal to stretch the program another three months. Democrats do not yet know whether they have enough Republican support to get the 60 votes necessary to clear the procedural hurdle, a senior leadership aide told CNN. The fight has played out repeatedly over the past few years as the two parties clashed in often dramatic showdowns rife with fiery rhetoric and lengthy filibusters.","Last week Congress failed to continue a law providing nearly a year of unemployment benefits .

"(CNN) -- Gov. Chris Christie granted interviews to all five major news networks Wednesday morning, reveling in the thumping Republican governors gave Democrats on Election Night. As chairman of the Republican Governors Association, Christie helped raise $106 million over the past year and made public appearances with candidates in 26 states, on top of fundraisers and other RGA events in 10 others. Republicans picked up four Democratic-held governorships and held on to key competitive states. ""I love that map this morning,"" the New Jersey Republican said on Fox News, with a slightly raspy voice. ""It looks absolutely fabulous."" 4 things Christie said the morning after the midterms . For Christie, the night represented a high point after months of controversy surrounding his office's involvement with the Bridgegate scandal and budget woes in New Jersey. The victories gave him fresh momentum and leadership bona fides as he prepares for a potential presidential run. lt also capped off a year of political growth and learning how to be a ""team player,"" said GOP strategist Ford O'Connell. ""Part of the midterms was about widening his political appeal -- it was about collecting chits from donors and activists,"" he continued. ""But it was also about demonstrating to fellow Republicans that you can play nice with others in your own party."" Get ready: 2016 starts now . Post-midterms, Christie was strategic in trying to keep the candidates in the spotlight Wednesday morning, saying on NBC that ""the candidates deserve the credit -- it's always about the candidates."" But Phil Cox, the executive director of the RGA, was less bashful, telling reporters on a conference call that Christie ""deserves an immense amount of credit for the leadership he provided."" Cox also argued that the expanded red map puts the GOP in a strong position for 2016, with Republicans still at the helm in presidential battleground states like Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Nevada, New Mexico, and Wisconsin. And Cox predicted ""a number of Republican governors"" will likely run for president. For his part, Christie tried to appear no more closer to making his own 2016 decision. Pressed by CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" to elaborate on the public pressure he's facing to run, Christie didn't budge, saying only they he'll make his decision ""based on my own time table and not on anybody else's."" GOP governors win blue states . Asked how he can say no to 2016 after having a successful year, Christie replied: ""I don't know that you'd say 'no'. But I haven't said 'yes.'"" ""That's a big difference,"" he added. On ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Christie said the past year of traveling gave him and his family a better feel for what a national campaign would be like. But Christie said it's not fair yet to say he's closer to a 2016 run. ""It's fair to say that what I'm looking for is a nap,"" he said. Christie also used the morning shows to defend his tough-guy personality, a trait that was on full display last week when he blew up at a heckler who interrupted him at a Superstorm Sandy event, commanding the man to ""sit down and shut up."" Democrats--and some Republicans--pounced on the episode to further paint Christie as a bully. But the second-term governor said Wednesday he has no regrets and brushed off criticism that he needs to tame his temperament. ""Why would anybody think that what I did last night wasn't controlled, first off? Why would they think that I didn't do exactly what I wanted to do?"" he said on CNN. As he has several time this year, he hit back against those who say his style won't play beyond his home state of New Jersey. ""I'm going to be myself. If I decide to run for something and that's not good enough, then that's not good enough,"" he said. I'm not going to change who I am--not for anybody.""","Under Chris Christie's leadership, the GOP gubernatorial campaign arm won key races .

"Cambridge, New Zealand (CNN) -- Cambridge, New Zealand is a small, picturesque town of just 18,400 inhabitants. The last time there was a royal visit here was a generation ago, in 1953, when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip came just after the Queen's coronation. Locals still talk about that moment in local history, but now they have the next chapter. Excitement about this weekend's visit by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge was on full display in the pretty high street. Every other shop had been decorated with bunting and royal paraphernalia. It was as if everyone had rummaged through their drawers looking for anything royal or just UK-related and turned it into a display. There was mannequin wearing a Union flag apron and a tea cozy on her head; tea caddies, tea cups, tea pots; umbrellas, ornamental London phone boxes and buses. There was even a tattered guidebook from Windsor Castle. Acoustic Mexican wave . The night before the visit, excitement reached fever pitch. People started camping outside the town hall. By dawn Saturday, the pavements were lined with well-wishers. People had come from as far away as New Zealand's capital, Wellington. By lunchtime, the population of the town had doubled. When we approached them with our camera, they cheered -- in fact if anything happened, they cheered. One teenager said she was a republican but had come here because of her mother who was a big royal fan. Both got in the spirit of things with matching tiara hair grips. There's always an eery calm before the royals actually turn up. The roads are cleared, security is locked down and then there is a pause before you hear -- then see -- police outriders. Suddenly, the royal limo is right there before you. Cue: scream. It's inverted ""Bieber fever,"" mums and daughters -- but with the mums shouting. In Cambridge, the royal convoy did a loop through the town and there was an acoustic Mexican wave as the cheers followed them. As the couple pulled up at the town hall and got out, the cheers erupted into screams ... then a huge boo, which was odd. Turns out a van had blocked the crowd's view but was quickly moved on, allowing the screams to resume. The Duchess hasn't been to New Zealand before and she wanted to meet as many people as possible, so ""walkabouts"" have been built into the schedule. Republican to royalist . At the Cambridge Town Hall, after meeting dignitaries and paying their respects at the war memorial, The Duke and Duchess crossed the road to the now heaving crowds. ""I was here at half past two in the morning,"" said one lady. ""But this was an opportunity that I was not prepared to let go by any means of the imagination. I was going to be here come whatever."" After less than an hour, the royal visit was over. I spotted the royalist mother with her republican daughter. ""How did you cope?"" I asked. ""I know you were quite excited beforehand."" ""I was, I went all gooey,"" she said. ""Completely lost it but the good news is, I think I have converted my daughter to a royalist."" I put that to the daughter who said: ""Yep. He shook my hand."" ""That's all it takes?"" I asked and she said; ""Yep."" This royal tour must be sending shudders through the spine of the New Zealand republican movement. But we won't know what real impact it has had until the whirlwind is over, the window displays are back in the drawers and New Zealanders have had a proper chance to consider whether the Cambridges are people they like to see -- or would like to reign.","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George are visiting NZ and Australia .

"London (CNN) -- The editor of an Italian magazine that has caused an uproar by publishing vacation photos of a bikini-clad Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, with her baby bump visible accused the international media Wednesday of overreacting. Chi Editor-in-Chief Alfonso Signorini said the photos were not scandalous, do not ""wrong the image"" of the royal couple and ""portray a couple in love in a happy moment while they are walking on the beach."" The photos were taken on a public beach and bought from an international agency, he said. ""We cannot talk about violation of privacy when we publish pictures of public people in a public place, out in the open as it is the case of a beach that is visited by other people,"" he said. St. James's Palace -- which represents Catherine, her husband, Prince William, and his brother, Harry -- responded with dismay Tuesday to news that the photos would be released. ""We are disappointed that photographs of the Duke and Duchess on a private holiday look likely to be published overseas,"" a palace representative said. ""This is a clear breach of the couple's right to privacy."" Despite the royal family's objections, an Australian magazine said it too would be publishing the images. Woman's Day said it had won Australian publishing rights after two days of ""furious bidding"" between three magazines. ""It's ticking all the boxes, it's Kate who we love and adore, who's a fantastic cover girl, a great seller. It's a bikini shot, a beach shot, beautiful crystal blue water. And she's pregnant. It's the bump that we've been waiting to see for such a long time,"" Woman's Day editor Fiona Connolly told Australia's Ten News. It was not immediately clear when or exactly where the pictures were taken. British and U.S. media -- including People, like CNN a division of Time Warner -- reported that the royal couple recently vacationed on the secluded Caribbean isle of Mustique. Connolly said the images were taken at a public beach where the royal couple was mingling with other holidaymakers, describing the decision to publish them as ""very easy."" She added: ""Australians are so much more laid back about seeing bikinis and beach shots than the British are. I think there's a bit of hypersensitivity over this particular set (of photos)."" UK newspapers did not reproduce the images but wrote of the royal couple's anguish about the breach of privacy. And broadcaster ITV issued an apology after its ""This Morning"" show ""accidentally showed an unblurred image of the magazine cover, which briefly showed the photographs. ""This was a deeply regrettable error and we are very sorry,"" it said. On Tuesday, Chi described the photos as ""extraordinary images of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their dream holiday in the Caribbean."" ""The future mum, now in her fourth month of pregnancy, wears a small bikini that enhances her now visible bump,"" the magazine said. The Duchess, whose maiden name is Kate Middleton, has kept a low profile since the announcement in December that she is set to give birth to her first child in July. Images showing any evidence of a baby bump have been hard to come by in that time. The Chi photos, though, are not her first encounter with paparazzi, which tracked her during her long courtship with William, their engagement and their time since April 2011 as a married couple. The highest-profile example came in September 2012, when the French magazine Closer ran photographs of Catherine privately sunbathing topless while on a holiday with William in France. Besides that magazine, some of those photos also were published in the Irish Daily Star newspaper and Chi, which according to its parent company Mondadori is a women's magazine with an average circulation of more than 218,000 and a readership well beyond that. Soon after the photos came out, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took legal action against Closer, which was fined by a French court and ordered not to distribute the edition in print or online. It was also told to hand over the photos to the royals. READ RELATED: The Duchess of Cambridge's fashion secrets revealed .

"Washington (CNN) -- When presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney appears before Latino small-business owners in Washington on Wednesday, he'll address a group whose explosive birth rates foreshadow a seismic political shift in GOP strongholds in the Deep South and Southwest. ""The Republicans' problem is their voters are white, aging and dying off,"" said David Bositis, a senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, who studies minority political engagement. ""There will come a time when they suffer catastrophic losses with the realization of the population changes."" Over the next several generations, the wave of minority voters -- who, according to U.S. Census figures released this week, now represent more than half of the nation's population born in the past year -- will become more of a power base in places like Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. That hold will extend across the Southwest all the way to California, experts say. Opinion: Sorry Rush Limbaugh, minorities not looking for 'payback' The coming political revolution could result in a massive changing of the guard on nearly every level of government, potential cultural clashes, and the type of political alliances that are now considered rare. Offspring of immigrant farm workers . In Georgia, those rumblings are already being felt. It is a state that depends heavily on immigrant labor to pick peaches and peanuts and work in poultry plants. So when Georgia -- like its Southern sister states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and South Carolina -- passed a tough anti-immigration bill that also penalizes businesses, Hispanic groups and farmers alike pushed back. ""This election cycle Latinos in Georgia are upset about (the law),"" said Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of GALEO, a nonprofit and nonpartisan group geared toward Georgia's growing Latino population. ""That's going to spur more galvanization than we've ever seen before."" According to the Pew Hispanic Center, Southeastern states such as Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee boast some of the greatest percentage increases in Latino population growth. They are also states where the percentage of Hispanics roughly doubled. And, according to Pew, the Latino population boom helped Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Washington net additional congressional seats. Though Georgia's Latino population has mushroomed over the past ten years, according to Pew, roughly 23% of that group is eligible to vote, compared to roughly 76.2% of whites and just over 69% of African-Americans. Still, activists like Gonzalez are hopeful that lawmakers will see the trends and recognize ""Latinos merit a seat at the table as well."" So far, Republican efforts to offer Latinos a place at the table have fallen short. The nation's Hispanics tend to vote Democratic, and overwhelmingly supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden in 2008. Romney in particular has stumbled with this critical voting bloc, after his comments suggesting that making the economic landscape tough for illegal immigrants will force them to ""self deport."" Trying to convince a growing population . Even Republican Hispanic lawmakers, such as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, have urged the GOP to soften its language when discussing immigration and such proposals as the House-passed version of the Violence Against Women Act, which killed expanded coverage for illegal immigrants and Native Americans who are victims of domestic abuse, and the failed DREAM Act, which would have given U.S. residency to immigrant kids with high school diplomas. The GOP is trying to clean up its image with Hispanic voters, with an eye toward the demographic's looming political clout. Romney is slated to speak at the Latino Coalition's Annual Economic Summit in Washington on Wednesday. Last week, his campaign released ""Dia Uno,"" a Spanish-language version of an ad underscoring Romney's mission for the first day he assumes the presidency. If Republicans continue to struggle to appeal to Latino voters, Spanish-language ads may not stave off a change that experts like Bositis see coming in the not too distant future, when states such as Georgia go purple and eventually blue. ""There'll be a tipping point where you've got the Republicans in charge, but you'll get to the point when the population becomes minority,"" Bositis said. ""When that happens the statewide offices will fall. Republican governors will fall. Things will change."" This announcement on birth rates ""should be a wake-up call to everyone running for political office from this day forward,"" said Lionel Sosa, a veteran Latino GOP strategist who has helped advise candidates since 1980. ""Latinos should no longer be considered minorities. In many crucial electoral states, this 'former minority' is fast becoming the deciding vote. The candidate who reaches out most effectively will win their support."" ""Token efforts, such as tamale parties, will no longer work. Winning will require more than outreach. It will require inclusion,"" Sosa said. ""Latinos, African-Americans and people of other races must be represented in the important decision-making strategies of any given campaign, whether it be for a Democrat or Republican.""","Births of nonwhites have now overtaken births of whites, according to the U.S. Census .
Republicans face uphill battle in persuading Latinos to vote for their candidates .
Shift is most pronounced in the South and Southwest ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Take a look at the more diverse slate of potential 2016 Republican presidential contenders and one thing becomes quite clear: this is not your daddy's GOP -- at the top anyway. There are Latino Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas. There is an Indian American: Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. And joining Jindal, Rubio and Cruz from the Generation X ranks are Gov. Scott Walker and Rep. Paul Ryan, both of Wisconsin. Boomers potentially in the mix include Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Sen. Rand Paul of Texas and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Three out of the past four Republican nominees were all well into their 60s, while the Democrats over the same period went with younger candidates. Now look: . Democrats are taking a page from Ronald Reagan, the oldest president ever on Inauguration Day at 69. Hillary Clinton would be that age on Election Day 2016, if she runs and wins, while Vice President Joe Biden might be considered historically ""young"" for a senator at 73 at the same point, but breaking new ground for the Oval Office. Both are quite pale, too, and so is most of ""the bench"" of the party that embraced history in 2008 and nominated the first African American for President in Barack Obama, who was at the time merely in his 40s. GOP race for 2016 is wide open . ""Democrats are known as having great policies (for minorities) on paper, but it's harder to rise through the ranks,"" said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. ""The Republicans don't have great policies on paper, but they are often more supportive of their minority candidates."" Obama's election meant that many of the Democratic old guard, folks like Clinton and Biden, had to bide their time and wait until the next cycle. But his time around people like Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick are barely a consideration, she said. ""If you want to present something different, young, charismatic black guy isn't it,"" Gillespie said. The Republican Party was blasted during the 2012 presidential election as the party of old, white, men for their presidential and congressional candidate lineups. The GOP lost among young people, minorities and women in large numbers and was forced to do some serious soul searching in preparation for the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential elections. GOP problem: 'Their voters are white, aging and dying off' But even as the Republican Party was taking a beating over its lack of diversity and tin ear on issues important to minorities, a class of young guns who more closely resembled the broader American electorate made headlines for their edgier brand of conservatism. ""These candidates have been very shrewd and extremely media savvy and have been able to garner a lot of attention very quickly,"" Gillespie said. ""It's partly their own skill and being in the right place at the right time. But it's also the Republican Party not wanting to look like the party of old white men."" As a tea party darling, Rubio has earned nods from conservative corners for his criticism of Obamacare, but is also seen as a more moderate voice in the debate over immigration reform. Cruz and Paul rode that same anti-establishment, tea party wave into Congress and have since garnered attention for their fiery rhetoric about the ills of big government and willingness to challenge the status quo. Christie rose to prominence because of his swaggering conservative style tempered by his willingness to reach across the aisle in his state. He made a splash, too, by giving Obama and his administration credit on Superstorm Sandy recovery efforts. Meanwhile, Santorum, Ryan, Jindal and Walker's clear and direct conservative approach to fiscal and governance matters is seen in right wing circles as a refreshing change from what some in the Republican Party have felt is a watered down version. ""The fact that the Democrats don't have the depth of diverse talent like the Republicans do might be an indication that, despite what they might have you believe, their party is old and stale,"" said Orlando Watson, the Republican National Committee communications director for black media. RNC highlights strategy for building 'new generation of black Republicans' The slate of potential 2016 GOP presidential hopefulsâ€”and to be clear, no one on either side of the aisle has officially announced a bidâ€”may be younger and more diverse. But the broader party is still too old, too white and too out of touch with the rest of America, said Lionel Sosa, a veteran Latino GOP strategist who has helped advise candidates since 1980. ""I think our party is stone deaf on the issue of Latinos and immigration. We're turning off not only Latinos, but also women, young people and Asians with stupid, intensive comments,"" Sosa said. He pointed to anti-immigration comments by recent Republican candidates and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's comments about Democrats thinking women ""can't control their libidos"" as ""equally stupid."" ""GOP candidates who cater to the extreme right in the primaries, don't realize the long term damage they're doing to the Republican brand in terms of alienating the segment of voters who are growing the fastest,"" Sosa said. ""This damage will be hard to overcome in the general election.""","In the 2016 election, the GOP could present a more diverse cadre of presidential hopefuls .
By contrast, the presumed Democratic likely frontrunners are older and white .
GOP focused on diversity after it lost big among minorities in 2012 .
Though their candidates are diverse, the party still has work to do in minority voter outreach ."
"(CNN) -- Joan Rivers is getting the ""Hollywood"" funeral she wanted, ""a huge showbiz affair with lights, camera and action."" Kathy Griffin, Sarah Jessica Parker, Whoopi Goldberg, Donald Trump, Diane Sawyer, Barbara Walters and Joy Behar were among the A-list to D-list celebrity friends seen arriving for the private service inside Manhattan's Temple Emanu-El Sunday. The highlight was Howard Stern's vagina joke, Fox News correspondent Geraldo Rivera told CNN afterward. ""It was exactly the show Joan wanted -- hilarious, irreverent,"" Rivera said. Rivers, 81, died Thursday in New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, a week after she suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest during a medical procedure at a clinic. Joan Rivers: A pointed, pioneering comedian . She talked about her mortality and what she wanted at her ""showbiz"" funeral in her 2013 book, ""I Hate Everyone ... Starting With Me."" She called for paparazzi and publicists ""making a scene"" outside the funeral, which she said should ""be Hollywood all the way."" In fact, Fifth Avenue was lined with more television crews, live reporters and fans than would gather for most Hollywood premieres. Inside the temple, Rivers wanted entertainment. ""I don't want some rabbi rambling on; I want Meryl Streep crying, in five different accents. I don't want a eulogy; I want Bobby Vinton to pick up my head and sing 'Mr. Lonely.' "" Instead of Vinton singing his 1964 hit, she had the New York Gay Men's Chorus and a song list including show tunes such as ""That's Entertainment,"" ""Nothing Like a Dame"" and ""What a Wonderful World."" They closed with ""Big Spender."" Joan Rivers: In her own words . Speakers included New York Post gossip columnist Cindy Adams, a longtime friend of Rivers, and ""Inside Edition"" host Deborah Norville. ""It was Joan all the way,"" with orchids filling the 2,000-seat sanctuary, Norville said after the funeral. ""You can't see the altar because there were so many flowers."" A rabbi offered an opening prayer after the show tunes, followed by a songs from Broadway star Audra McDonald. People magazine reported that McDonald sang ""Smile,"" a favorite of Rivers. The song's lyrics captured the feel of the service: ""Smile, though your heart is aching. Smile, even though it's breaking."" Actor Hugh Jackman sang ""Quiet Please, There's a Lady on Stage,"" People reported. Rivers' daughter, Melissa, read a letter she wrote in which she pretended to be her mother's landlord. She said her mother was late on the rent and had torn down a wall without permission because she wanted more space. The service ended with the New York Police Department's bagpipe band leading the procession out of the temple to the tunes of ""New York, New York,"" and ""Give My Regards to Broadway."" Rivers wrote in her book that she wanted to ""look gorgeous, better dead than I do alive,"" dressed in a Valentino gown and with a Harry Winston-designed toe tag. ""And I want a wind machine so that even in the casket my hair is blowing just like Beyonce's,"" she wrote. The raspy-voiced comedian was a household name. Brash and sassy, she poked fun at herself and the world in sometimes vicious, but witty, zingers. She was as quick-witted as she was sharp-tongued, saying things everyone may have been thinking, but few were brave enough to voice. ""My mother's greatest joy in life was to make people laugh,"" her daughter said last week. ""Although that is difficult to do right now, I know her final wish would be that we return to laughing soon."" Rivers had been on life support at Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital, where she was transported after she stopped breathing at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28. Rivers was undergoing an apparently minor elective procedure at the clinic when she suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest, according to the New York Fire Department. Paramedics took her by ambulance to Mount Sinai Hospital, about a mile from the clinic, where she was initially listed in critical condition. The state health department is investigating whether there was any malpractice by the doctors or staff at Yorkville Endoscopy, according to New York law enforcement officials. No criminal investigations are currently under way in Rivers' death, the officials said. The clinic has not responded to repeated calls from CNN about the state's investigation. Share your memories .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged Friday that differences remain between their governments on surveillance programs in the aftermath of disclosures by classified leaker Edward Snowden. Obama told reporters at a joint news conference at the White House that ""we're not perfectly aligned,"" noting the United States has no ""blanket no-spy agreement"" with any country, including close allies. Merkel later told business leaders that a balance must be struck between technical capability, security needs and privacy. ""In a nutshell, an end never justifies the means and not everything that's technically feasible ought to be done,"" she said. Germany and other friendly countries complained when Snowden's disclosures last year revealed U.S. surveillance of foreign leaders as well as screening of foreign phone calls and Internet contacts in investigating terrorist ties. The Obama administration responded that all countries conduct surveillance on each other, but the President also has ordered changes in U.S. programs. Obama said Friday that ""it has pained me to see the degree to which"" the Snowden disclosures have strained the relationship with Germany, a key ally. The issue ignited public anger in Europe, including Germany, and Merkel said talks with U.S. officials so far failed to bring agreement. ""Over the past few months, we've seen considerable differences of opinion and of interest between Germany and the United States over this issue, and I do think that we will not have fully overcome this, even after my visit,"" she said.

"London (CNN) -- British newspapers are abuzz with speculation that Prince William's pregnant wife Catherine is expecting a girl after a member of the public reported hearing what seemed to be a hint that a daughter is on the way. The Duchess of Cambridge was talking to people who turned out to welcome her as she visited the coastal town of Grimsby, in northeast England, on Tuesday when the apparent slip of the tongue was made. Pregnancy and privacy: Royal Catherine's dilemma . ""The lady next to me gave her a teddy bear and I distinctly heard her say: 'Thank you, I will take that for my d...' Then she stopped herself,"" recounted Sandra Cook, 67. ""I said to her: 'You were going to say daughter, weren't you?' She said: 'No, we don't know'. I said: 'Oh I think you do', to which she said: 'We're not telling'."" Does royal gender slip give palace the baby blues? Whatever Catherine, now five months pregnant, might have been meaning to say, the story has prompted a rash of headlines in UK newspapers. ""It's a girl! Pregnant Duchess of Cambridge drops huge hint she's having a daughter,"" proclaimed the Mirror. ""Has Kate just given the game away?"" asked the Daily Mail. Author's description of Catherine as 'machine-made' doll sparks angry reactions . A royal source quashed the speculation, telling CNN that the duke and duchess don't yet know the sex of their baby. Catherine, who was hospitalized with acute morning sickness in December, recently returned to public duties. The baby, who will be a great-grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, is due in July. If the child does turn out to be a girl, she is destined to ascend the throne as queen one day. Planned changes to the law of succession that end the tradition of a boy taking precedence over an elder sister are already de facto in effect, the British Cabinet Office has said. The child will be next in line to the British throne after William, whose father Charles is first in line.","Pregnant Catherine's apparent slip of the tongue prompts speculation it's a girl .

"(CNN) -- On Monday, King Juan Carlos, 76, of Spain announced that he will soon abdicate the throne, passing the crown to his son Crown Prince Felipe, who is 46. Explaining his decision to his Spanish subjects, Juan Carlos noted that his son will help ""open a new era of hope which combines the experience and momentum of a new generation."" Last year, Queen Beatrix, 75, of the Netherlands, abdicated the throne, also passing the crown to her eldest son. Explaining her decision to her Dutch subjects, she said, ""It was not because the office was too heavy for me, but because the responsibility for this country should lie in the hands of a new generation."" For those wondering why Queen Elizabeth II, an octogenarian, hasn't made a similar concession to youth, one has to realize that the modern British monarchy is founded on a different set of principles. As much as Britons might enjoy a change of pace at Windsor Castle, something faster and fresher, the monarchy in Britain is not about novelty. It's about staying the course, resolve, and perseverance. Indeed in a culture similar to ours that places a premium on youth and beauty, the British monarchy stands out as one of those rare institutions where aging, with all of its complications and humiliations, is allowed to -- and expected to -- take place in full public view. Consider King George III, who reigned from 1760 until his death in 1820 at the age of 81. Beginning in 1788, the king suffered periodic bouts from what was likely porphyria, a metabolic disorder affecting the nervous system. By 1810, he was permanently insane. Blind and infirm, George III spent the last 10 years of his reign doddering about in Windsor Castle. Admittedly, George's son, the future George IV, served as regent for most of this difficult period. Queen Victoria, George III's granddaughter, similarly reigned from 1837 until her death, also at the age of 81, in 1901 -- despite suffering a host of ailments in later years, including failing eyesight, insomnia and rheumatism. Yet both monarchs were perhaps more popular in their oldest age than ever before. George III survived the loss of the American colonies and the scandals surrounding his alleged madness to win the intense loyalty of most of his subjects. Following his 1809 Golden Jubilee, a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of a monarch's rule, the London Times proudly proclaimed that the event had been ""celebrated by all ranks of people in this great metropolis, in a manner worthy of an aged and venerable King, and a loyal and enlightened nation."" And Queen Victoria overcame early skepticism about her capabilities -- and a dramatic curtailment in support during the 1860s, when she retreated from public view to mourn the death of her husband, Prince Albert -- to become the ""Great White Queen,"" and the ""Grandmother of Europe."" At her 60th anniversary Diamond Jubilee in 1897, Victoria was feted like no sovereign before her. She may have only been able to offer a feeble wave from her carriage as she passed by throngs of well-wishers on her way to St. Paul's Cathedral, but her symbolic weight could not be overestimated. The current British monarch follows in her predecessors' footsteps. When the young Elizabeth received word in February 1952, while traveling abroad in Kenya, that her father George VI had passed away, she rushed home knowing that the title she had just inherited would be hers until death. ""By the sudden death of my dear father I am called to assume the duties and responsibilities of sovereignty,"" the 25-year old queen explained to her privy councilors back in London. ""My heart is too full for me to say more to you today than I shall always work, as my father did throughout his reign, to advance the happiness and prosperity of my peoples, spread as they are all the world over."" When Elizabeth said ""I shall always work,"" she meant it. More than 60 years later, at the age of 88, the Queen maintains an active schedule and is the patron of more than 600 charities and organizations. Add to this the fact that Elizabeth's reign, like those of her predecessors, has only seemed to improve with age, at least if measured by public approval ratings -- shortly before the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012, the market research company Ipsos MORI determined that support for the monarchy among adults in Britain is at an all-time high -- and there's little reason to think that Elizabeth will leave her post anytime soon. Much as Prince Charles and Prince William may grow tired of waiting in the wings, a Platinum Jubilee could well take place in 2022.

"(CNN) -- The news the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting a child marks a dramatic departure from previous royal pregnancies. For it is believed even the queen may not have been given the happy news. Buckingham Palace were forced to make the announcement only after Catherine was taken to hospital suffering from acute morning sickness. Usually proclamations of royal births are posted on the gates at Buckingham Palace only after the 12th week of pregnancy. But knowing it would be impossible to keep Catherine's visit to hospital a secret, Buckingham Palace took the unusual step of pre-empting press speculation and revealing the news immediately. The announcement is in stark contrast to Princess Diana's first pregnancy, which was announced some six weeks after the queen had been informed, and after months of intense press speculation. Royal advisors are being surprisingly open about Catherine's condition, despite recent intrusions into her private life, including the publication of topless photos, which were condemned by Buckingham Palace. It is believed a new spirit of openness has been embraced by William and Catherine in an attempt to prevent the massive press interest and speculation that surrounded Princess Diana. Prince William drove his wife to hospital earlier today and spent hours by her bedside. He left tonight looking tense but happy. Catherine is expected to stay in hospital for several days. Catherine and William baby news sparks media frenzy . Sources said the couple are ""incredibly happy but nervous."" In a statement on their website William and Catherine said they were ""delighted with the news."" It is unclear when senior members of the royal family, including the queen, were told about the pregnancy -- but a palace insider says Catherine's parents were already aware their eldest daughter was expecting because she was taken ill whilst staying at their family home in Berkshire this weekend. Catherine's pregnancy could turn out to be one of the most significant in the history of the British royal family, for the child will accede to the throne even if she is a girl. The child will not be subject to the centuries old law of primogeniture, which puts male heirs ahead of women. Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron has agreed a deal to change the rules on the royal line of succession, which means male heirs will no longer be given priority. News of the pregnancy was met with joy throughout the UK. Within minutes of the announcement being published on the royal couple's website it had crashed under the weight of traffic.

"Washington (CNN) -- Congress set off for a two-week recess Friday, flying out of Washington under a dark cloud: the ""Do-nothing"" label. But that term is too easy. If you take a closer look, it turns out the better fit may be the ""wasted-time"" Congress. The terms ""do-nothing"" and ""Congress"" may be so cemented together that the phrase no longer tells us much. At the moment, it may sound redundant. In 2013, Congress spent more time at the office but got less done with it than at any time in recent history. How much got done? Let's start there. There are many measures of congressional activity, but one has sparked the ""do-nothing"" label: Bills passed. • Bills passed 2013: 64 . • Where does that place?: That is the lowest amount in modern history. • What about recent years?: 148 ('12), 90 ('11), 258 ('10) and 125 ('09). The lowest figure during President George W. Bush's term was 136, double the amount passed this year. Lawmakers pass more blame than bills . Wait, bills passed does not mean ""good"" bills passed. This is true. And it is a key argument for Republicans especially. ""It's not how many bills you pass,"" Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, told CNN, ""It's how many you stop. A lot of them are bad."" This is what we're getting at here by bucking the ""do-nothing"" label. It does not capture the extent of the problem in Congress. 6 reasons why 2013 was a bad year for Obama . How else can you measure the mess on Capitol Hill? By the hundreds of hours it took Congress to get so little done. Days in session? We could look at the days in session, which were officially more than 150 for both the House and Senate. That is average for the Senate and way above average for the House. But those figures can be misleading: They include ""pro-forma"" sessions when the House and Senate are not really in Washington. Instead, consider time in session . • Senate time in session: More than 1,098 hours. • House time in session: More than 786 hours. . • Relatively: That's higher than average for the Senate over the past 30 years. And lower than average for the House. Senate clears key nominations, leaves town for Christmas . And there were issues that both parties pledged to address, but left unresolved in that work time. To name a few: . • Jobs, long-term unemployment . • Immigration . • Energy policy . In other words, Congress spent hundreds of hours in Washington -- far more than average for the Senate -- and still was not able to address most of the biggest issues of the day. ""It's a lot of wasted time,"" Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, told CNN, her frustrated tone at odds with her bright holiday red sweater. "" Ridiculous... It's exhausting... It's been getting worse and worse every year. Exponentially. There are so many issues we could be dealing with, and we're so discouraged."" This is perhaps the greatest area of bipartisan agreement: Congress is in Washington, but doing less. ""I think we've been working less, to be honest with you,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said as he left the last Senate vote of the year. When asked about the increased hours in the Senate, he was quick to respond, ""The number of hours doing nothing? Yes, absolutely."" There is a pervasive sense of frustration mixed with no clear path toward a better, more able Congress. ""I think a majority of the members are trying... and hope that getting back to where the Congress does its job is just right around the next corner,"" said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, who previously served as the Republican whip in the House. He lowered is voice. ""And we keep turning that corner and finding out we're not there yet. And that's frustrating."" It is a combination of doing relatively little, but taking an enormous amount of time doing it. ""A lot of wasted time to me,"" Boxer repeated. Obama says 2013 wasn't his worst year .","Congress spent more time in office this year but got less done .
Some Republicans argue that it's number of bad bills stopped that shows effectiveness .
""It's been getting worse and worse every year,"" veteran Democrat says .
Long-time Republican says, ""I think we've been working less"""
"(CNN) -- Nico Rosberg boosted his world title hopes ahead of the season finale in Abu Dhabi by holding off Mercedes teammate and championship leader Lewis Hamilton to win the Brazilian Grand Prix Sunday. His victory cuts Hamilton's lead in the standings to 17 points, with double points on offer in the final round in a fortnight. Rosberg, who started from the front of the grid after his 10th pole of the season, maintained his advantage over Hamilton throughout, the pair finishing over 40 seconds clear of third-placed Felipe Massa. Hamilton, who had overtaken Rosberg under similar circumstances to take the checkered flag in the U.S. Grand Prix in Texas last week, was left to rue a mistake just before the second round of pit stops on lap 28 at Interlagos. Staying out an extra lap in an attempt to leapfrog Rosberg through the tire changes, he spun off and lost several seconds. Hamilton pulled back most of the deficit of over seven seconds -- but could not repeat his Austin heroics as his run over five straight victories was ended. But a second-placed finish in Abu Dhabi will ensure Hamilton repeats his 2008 title triumph with McLaren. Massa, who was given a five-second penalty for an infringement, drove a fine race in the Williams to delight his home supporters, while Jenson Button took fourth for McLaren. Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel claimed fifth ahead of the Ferrari pair of Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen. But they were all playing second fiddle to the all-conquering Mercedes duo, with Rosberg polishing his credentials with his fifth win of the season. ""I was able to attack and control the gap to Lewis in the race,"" he said at the race presentations. ""It all worked out so that is great and the support has been excellent."" Hamilton admitted his error had proved key, but realizes there is all to play for in two weeks time. ""I made a big mistake in the middle of the race but otherwise the car was superb and everyone did a great job,"" was the verdict of the Briton.","Nico Rosberg wins Brazil GP at Sao Paulo .

"(CNN) -- Shortly after 1:30 p.m. on February 24, 2010, a SeaWorld Orlando trainer lost her life in a tragic accident involving one of the park's killer whales. The death of Dawn Brancheau was an occasion of almost unbearable sadness for those closest to Dawn -- her family, friends and colleagues at SeaWorld. I was honored to know Dawn and count myself among those SeaWorld team members deeply affected by her loss. Dawn's death has been the subject of thousands of articles, broadcast news stories, blogs, books, and now a feature film called ""Blackfish."" Many of these accounts trade in the details of Dawn's death in graphic detail. They do so not to inform but, rather, regrettably, because of the desire to sensationalize. Filmmaker: Why I made 'Blackfish' The three years since Dawn's death have seen the emergence of individuals who have chosen not to honor her memory, but rather to use the events of February 24, 2010, to advance their own interests. Some seek commercial gain. Others seek to forward a political or philosophical agenda. Still others appear to be engaged in self-promotion. But anyone approaching this subject in good faith must recognize a simple fact: Our staff has interacted with killer whales -- for veterinary care, training, shows, educational presentations, husbandry, exercise, play and enrichment -- hundreds of times a day for nearly 50 years. The tragedy of Dawn's death cannot and has not been ignored, but neither should the literally millions of safe interactions we have had with killer whales over that span of time. ""Blackfish"" focuses on a handful of incidents over our long history at the exclusion of everything else. Not a single interview with a guest who was inspired and enriched by their experience with killer whales at SeaWorld. Not one visitor who left SeaWorld more aware of the need to preserve the world around them. Not one word about the thousands of ill, orphaned and injured animals rescued by SeaWorld or the millions of dollars we dedicate to supporting conservation and research. There is no acknowledgment anywhere in the film of the great things SeaWorld does every day or the simple fact that our animals are healthy and passionately cared for. SeaWorld answers CNN's questions on orcas . I started at Sea World in 1975 and have witnessed the growth and changes that come with a company that is dedicated to understanding these magnificent animals. We have collected invaluable information about these animals that could not be obtained from observation in the wild. In the three years since Dawn's death, we have again made significant changes at SeaWorld. We have altered how we care for, display and train these extraordinary animals. We have changed the facilities, equipment and procedures at our killer whale habitats. The care and educational presentation of these animals at SeaWorld has been made safer than ever. Does ""Blackfish"" inform its viewers of that fact? No, it does not. And by that omission the film reveals itself not as a work of objective documentary filmmaking, but rather as something closer to propaganda. As we have said many times, there is simply no higher priority for us than the safety of our guests and staff and the welfare of our animals. We understand that there will always be individuals and groups opposed to the care of animals in zoos and aquariums. We recognize that we must defend what we do and the manner in which we do it. Blackfish, like other works driven by the same agenda, ignores the extraordinary benefits to conservation, scientific research and education of America's zoo and aquariums. But through it all SeaWorld remains the world's most respected marine zoological institution. Our parks are staffed with skilled and caring zoological professionals, all of whom deserve to have their work celebrated, not dishonored by things like ""Blackfish."" Despite what the makers of this film may suggest, SeaWorld is the kind of organization that draws dedicated and passionate people like Dawn Brancheau. These are the men and women who have built SeaWorld into an extraordinary place, one that provides inspiring, enriching and educational experiences to more than 11 million people each year. That, not the inaccurate and shamefully misleading account in ""Blackfish,"" is what SeaWorld really is. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Scarpuzzi.

"London (CNN) -- There's a treat in store for anyone in Britain whose baby arrives on the same day that Prince William and his wife, Catherine, deliver a royal heir -- the gift of a coin from the Royal Mint to celebrate the birth. The silver penny will be dated 2013 and come in a blue pouch for a boy or a pink one for a girl. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting their first child in the middle of this month. They have opted not to know the sex of the baby before it shows up. According to sources familiar with the plans, Catherine will give birth in the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, where William was also born. Read more: What will royal baby's name be? Thanks to a change in the ancient laws of succession, their child will be next in line to the British throne after William and his father, Prince Charles, regardless of its gender. To claim the silver coin, UK parents whose baby's birth coincides with that of the royal baby will have to register through the Royal Mint's Facebook page and upload a scanned copy of the birth certificate within 60 days. It is making 2,013 of the coins available. The Royal Mint says the gesture reflects the tradition of marking a new birth with a gift of silver for good luck. ""The birth of the royal baby will be a joyous occasion not just for Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge but also for the whole nation,"" said Shane Bissett, director of commemorative coin at the Royal Mint.

On June 2, the Royal Mint marked exactly 60 years since her 1953 formal coronation by minting 2,013 commemorative gold sovereign coins. She had ascended to the throne the previous year. The royal baby will also one day lend its face to the nation's small change as monarch. Read more: Will royal baby be a boy or a girl?

"Reno, Nevada (CNN) -- ""Mass casualties"" were reported at an air show after a plane slammed into the box seat area in front of a grandstand at the National Championship Air Races and Air Show in Reno on Friday, a spokesman for the show told CNN. At least two people died and 54 people were transported from the scene with injuries, according to officials. The pilot, identified as Jimmy Leeward, a real estate developer from Ocala, Florida, was likely killed in the crash, the show said in a statement. He was flying a P-51 Mustang. The event has been canceled and a memorial service will be held for the pilot Saturday afternoon, the show said. Leeward speaks the day before the crash . A Reno hospital said Friday night on its website that it had received a ""total of 25 patients"" after the plane crashed. It said two people, one male and one female, had died. It was not immediately clear whether that figure counted the pilot. The patients included twelve people in critical condition, meaning their vital signs are unstable ""and not within normal limits,"" and 11 in fair condition, exhibiting stable vital signs, according to the 7:30 p.m. PT update on the Renown Regional Medical Center website. The hospital also noted that four patients being treated at Renown South Medical Center were in fair condition. Mike Houghton, president of the Reno Air Racing Association, told reporters that 54 people were transported from the scene with injuries. Video of the crash, posted on YouTube, showed a plane plummeting from the sky, sending up clouds of dust and debris. Shocked spectators rose to their feet. Fred Scholz, a witness, said he saw the plane seemingly ""coming straight down."" ""I thought he was coming right on top of us,"" he said, noting that the aircraft ultimately hit about 100 feet from him, in an area of box seats, filled with folding chairs. ""Luckily there was no fire, which surprised me,"" said Scholz, a 59-year-old from Truckee, California, who says he goes to air races ever year. ""It just happened so quickly."" Scholz: We were deer in headlights . Another witness, Greg Mills, added that the pilot ""didn't have enough altitude to pull up,"" with the aircraft shuddering before slamming to the ground about 50 to 75 yards from where he was standing. ""We got showered by little stuff,"" said Mills, who works at the Pacific Aviation Museum based in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, describing a chaotic scene afterward. ""Everybody was running."" The plane, called the ""Galloping Ghost,"" was taking part in a qualifying round in the ""unlimited class"" division of the air race when it went down around 4:15 p.m. PT Friday, said Mike Draper, the show spokesman. The final rounds had been slated for the weekend. The aircraft was about a lap into the race when the pilot sent out a ""Mayday signal"" and pulled ""out of the lap"" before crashing into a box seat area that is in front of a grandstand at the ""very large race field,"" located about 15 miles north of Reno, Draper said. ""It was clear that (the plane) was pulling up and was in distress,"" he said. He added that authorities do not yet know why the aircraft went down. Besides the Federal Aviation Administration personnel already there to assist the National Transportation Safety Board in any investigation, the show's spokesman said that National Guard members -- who were on-site practicing before the incident -- are helping emergency personnel to clear the area. ""There are people still being escorted out of that area with various injuries,"" Draper said. Reno Mayor Bob Cashell told CNN that ""700 or 800 emergency personnel showed up in a matter of minutes."" ""You couldn't believe how fast they came,"" said Cashell, adding that citizens and some troops on site also helped with the injured. ""Just watching these people and the way they responded, and it's been magnificent."" Local fire officials are reporting multiple fatalities and critical injuries, according to Ian Gregor, a spokesman with the FAA. He said the aircraft did not catch fire, but there was a wide debris field following the crash. Gary Arthur, another witness to the accident, said the plane wavered a few times, suggesting the pilot had tried to get control before going down. ""Just the sound of the impact was unbelievable,"" he said. ""Almost can't believe you saw what actually happened."" In 2007, a mid-air collision during the annual National Championship Air Races in Reno claimed the life of one of the two pilots involved. The collision was the latest in a string of accidents that plagued the races that week, killing three pilots. CNN's Mike Ahlers, Kelly Marshall Smoot, Greg Morrison and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","NEW: A Reno, Nevada, hospital says two people are dead .

"(CNN) -- Whenever a new baby is on the way, the family can't help but speculate on what the little one might look like. Will he or she have straight hair like Dad or curly hair like Mom? Be tall like Aunt Susan or short and stubby like Uncle Leroy? When the new arrival is the future king or queen of England, more than just the family wants to know. Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, is reportedly due to give birth July 13, and the world will watch as the baby grows up. Will he or she turn out to have blue eyes like Prince William or green ones like Catherine? Be light-haired like Dad or dark-haired like Mom? Will Prince Charles' ears be passed on to a future generation? Online bets are already being placed on the child's hair color. Whatever happens, this baby might stand out genetically among royals because his mother is the first commoner to marry into the royal family since the 17th century. Marriage within a relatively small gene pool, like the royals, means a bad gene has a pretty good chance of rearing its ugly head. The blood clotting disorder hemophilia, for example, has run in the British royal family. ""It's very good that they're bringing in new genes,"" said Dr. Anand Saggar, a consultant in the South West Thames Regional Genetics Department at St. George's Hospital Medical School in London. ""It freshens up the gene pool."" Royal baby slightly more likely to be female, scientist says . Catherine's commoner genes might lead to a somewhat darker-skinned baby, Saggar said. The royals, he explained, are pretty pale. Catherine's skin has a considerably more olive tone, and the baby will likely be somewhere between the two -- but more like Catherine because her genes are dominant over lighter ones. ""The odds are the child will have darker skin color than the royals might be used to,"" Saggar said. The same is true for eye color. The chances that the baby will have true blue eyes like William's are relatively unlikely. Most likely, Saggar said, the baby's eyes will be a shade closer to Catherine's. With hair color, there are basically four options: light like Dad, dark like Mom, a shade in between the two or red like the baby's Uncle Harry. Saggar said it's possible to calculate the odds of a redhead. Based on the fact that William's brother, Prince Harry, is a ginger, there's a 66% chance that William carries a gene for red hair, he said. Less is known about Catherine's heritage, but assuming it's similar to the genes of other British people, he calculates there's a 6% chance the baby will have red hair. Apparently Britons are more confident the baby will have red hair. At William Hill online betting, there are 4-1 odds the baby will be a ginger. ""If you're going to put some money on it, you might want to think about it,"" Saggar said. While hair color might be debatable, one physical trait seems pretty clear: William and Catherine's child will likely be quite tall. William is reportedly around 6 foot 3 inches tall, and his wife about 5 feet 10 inches. A son would likely be between 5 feet 11 inches and 6 feet 7 inches, and a daughter between 5 feet 6 inches and 6 feet 2 inches, according to Barry Starr, director of outreach at the department of genetics at Stanford University. Of course, it's impossible to use genetics to predict completely what any baby will look like, royal or not. ""That's the fun of having babies,"" Saggar said.

"London (CNN) -- Foreign fighters inside Syria and Iraq have become a massive concern for authorities worldwide. Many are alarmed at the quick rise in the number of Westerners who have joined militant groups trying to establish an Islamic caliphate, with several investigations launched following the gruesome beheading of American journalist James Foley last week. We have been tracking foreign fighters going into Syria for more than a year. During this time, we came across two young men willing to speak to us through Skype from inside the country, where they are helping battle President Bashar al-Assad's forces. We first spoke to them couple of months ago and have been in touch since. After much back and forth -- and a lot of convincing -- they agreed to an interview with us from northern Syria, using Skype in what looked like a hidden internet cafe. As expected, the connection was not great and it took several attempts to finally talk to them. Despite having spoken to the pair before, it was not easy to identify which masked militant was which. As they sat down to begin the interview they were careful to adjust their scarves to cover most of their faces. An AK-47 was positioned deliberately and carefully between them. With unintended humour and in a serious fashion they reintroduced themselves by their jihadi aliases: Abu Bakr and Abu Anwar. Abu Bakr was open to talking with us and he gradually agreed to bring other fighters along for an on-camera interview, a process made tougher as both Bakr and Anwar change locations every couple of months. Abu Bakr wouldn't tell us where he is from but Abu Anwar is British. ""I'm from the south of England,"" he explained. ""I grew up in a middle-class family. Life was easy back home. I had a life. I had a car. But the thing is: you cannot practice Islam back home. ""We see all around us evil. We see paedophiles. We see homosexuality. We see crime. We see rape. And we can't do anything about it because we are obeying [by] the laws of the kuffar."" Initially, both fighters came to Syria to join the rebel alliance against the regime of Bashar al Assad -- but they now believe that establishing an Islamic caliphate is more important. When we asked Abu Anwar what message he had for friends back home, it was a call to join the fight. ""Leave the lands of infidelity and leave for the lands of Islam,"" he said. ""We have an Islamic state in Raqqa. Alhamdulillah [""All praise and thanks to God""] now in Iraq. And I ask all my Muslim friends to make hijrah [""holy journey""] to these Islamic states."" In all our conversations, both men proved unfailingly polite. They patiently answered our questions, determined for us to see their point of view: for them, America is an immoral country at war with Muslims . Our talk was dominated by discussions of what they see as American injustices, from Guantanamo to Abu Ghraib. They also called for the release of Aafia Siddique, a female U.S. trained scientist convicted in 2010 of shooting at U.S. officers while in custody in Afghanistan. Abu Bakr became agitated as he mentioned he has heard word that there are other Muslim female prisoners, held in American custody, who are given the same treatment as men. Both Bakr and Anwar agreed that this was a complete injustice. In our most recent interview we asked them about the videotaped killing of American journalist James Foley. ""When the video was released we watched it in our base and one of the brothers downloaded it and my initial response was that this was a direct response to the crimes of the US against the Islamic State,"" said Abu Anwar. Abu Bakar added: ""We thought the Islamic state has no other choice really. The U.S. has the technology but it doesn't mean they can call any country and bomb anybody they want and not stop on anything. ISIS tried to negotiate for a Muslim prisoner, tried to negotiate with them for ransom but then they are too arrogant you see. We thought it was very justified and we thought what James Foley said himself... that his real killers were actually the U.S."" Their interpretation of Islam is radical and extreme: their sense of justice is medieval and they call the Muslim Council of Britain, the UK's largest Muslim organization, ""apostates."" We asked them if they would consider carrying out an execution by beheading. ""This is the Islamic way of execution and we will do only that which please Allah,"" replied Abu Anwar. ""It means cutting off the necks of the enemies of Islam then we are more than happy to do it. I would like to meet the Lord Allah and tell him what I did for his religion. I hope God gives me the chance to do what the brother did with James Foley. Whether it's James Foley, or a soldier of America or Bashar Al Assad... my hands are ready to do this blessed act."" But when we asked why they continue to support ISIS -- when even al Qaeda has condemned the group's brutality -- they initially struggled to answer and their commitment wavered. ""It's a tactical difference,"" explained Abu Bakr. ""Basically al Qaeda doesn't say they are very brutal. They have operational differences with them. And they disagree with them. But whatever is Islamically allowed, we do it. It doesn't matter which group it is and what it is called, ISIS or al Qaeda."" We had asked for more details; on the battles they fought, on where they are positioned. But the men were cautious not to give too much away. They have sent us pictures of their basic training in a militant camp: in one photo, Abu Bakr is positioned in a foxhole holding a Kalashnikov. The only time they seemed to pause in their Islamist rhetoric was when discussing their families. When we first asked Abu Anwar what his mother would say, he was silent, refusing to talk about them. It's clear that both expect to die in Syria, either in battle or in what they call a ""martyrdom mission,"" a suicide attack against enemy forces. Abu Anwar said that his family has given up hope of trying to bring him back. ""No. They don't ask me to come back any more. Because they did at the beginning but they know now that I am not coming back. So, there is no point in wasting their breath. We pray a lot that Allah give you success and Allah accepts this jihad from you. They understand that I am not coming back and they know that they will not see me again in this life.""","CNN speaks exclusively to foreign jihadist fighters based in Syria .

"(CNN) -- On the anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre, which comes the day after yet another awful school shooting, it's time not only to remember the lives lost on that awful December day but also to reimagine how we think and talk about guns in America. The typical gun debate pits ""gun rights"" against ""gun control."" That frame is so ingrained that we hardly note it when the press describes those who want to reduce violence via firearms as ""gun control activists"" and those who oppose them as ""gun rights advocates."" It's an either/or: rights or control. This binary choice feeds bipolar fear and anger, especially on the rights side, leading to scenes like Alex Jones screaming insanely at Piers Morgan on CNN. That may make for compelling television, and such conflicts are satisfying to each side's core constituents. But there is a better way to talk about guns -- and, perhaps more importantly, to address the problem of gun violence. And that's to focus on ""gun responsibility."" Gun responsibility isn't gun control. It isn't about ""controlling"" people or banning ownership of guns or confiscating weapons. But neither is it about treating the gun issue as if it were only a matter of rights -- as if everything else, from the safety of our children to the lethality of everyday crime to the reduction of gun suicides or accidents, were irrelevant. A gun responsibility agenda respects the Second Amendment right to bear arms. It also demands that the right be exercised with the level of responsibility that a functioning society applies to any public health or safety issue. That means first we shouldn't dismiss gun owners as an undifferentiated mass of zealots, or dismiss gun culture as simply the overcompensating fearmongering of insecure men. I've fired an M-16A2 semiautomatic rifle at Marine Corps target practice. I've hunted deer and duck with a rifle and shotgun. I can respect those who respect the power of these weapons and the craft of their skillful use. At the same time, gun responsibility means accepting -- indeed, championing -- reasonable rules and standards for the ownership and use of firearms. Criminal background checks prior to gun purchases, to take one obvious example, should be completely noncontroversial. That's the bare minimum responsibility requires. Criminal background checks can't prevent every gun death, of course. Similarly, speed limits and seat belt laws can't prevent every highway death. That is no argument for the repeal of either. It's just a reminder that our job as citizens is to make rules that reduce the chances of preventable harm. Yet on days when there isn't a mass shooting or the commemoration of one, we Americans have accepted as unremarkable an unrelenting flow of 30-plus gun murders a day. Changing that will require changes to both law and norms. That's why in my home state of Washington I joined a group of citizens to create a grass-roots organization called the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility. We're supporting a background checks ballot initiative, but we're also working with faith leaders and parents and others to change the attitude on a deeper level. This is the zone of common sense, where we each do what we can and where not every curb on our desires is a total surrender of liberty. This is where a large and growing majority of Americans live. Background checks, for instance, garner 80% to 90% support in most public opinion polls. The idea of gun responsibility can and does appeal to people across the spectrum. A majority of NRA members would likely call themselves adherents. It's not about left versus right. It's just about being adult versus being immature. Adults know that every right carries an implicit duty to others -- that no right, constitutional or not, is absolute -- and they live accordingly. Such mindsets have nothing to do with age. A group of activists has chosen to designate December 15, the day after the Newtown anniversary, as ""Guns Save Lives Day."" They'll ignore the desire of Sandy Hook families for quiet by loudly protesting ""attacks"" on their gun rights. They'll brandish firearms and insist against evidence that more guns means less gun violence. There is a term for this, drawn from adolescent psychology: acting out. America can't afford to act out anymore. We have a problem to solve, which is tens of thousands of gun deaths a year. A good way to honor the children of Sandy Hook Elementary school is to thank gun owners who behave like adults, to support policies that encourage greater gun responsibility -- and to remember that this is how we fulfill our Second Amendment duties. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Liu.","The anniversary of Newtown massacre is coming up; let's re-examine gun debate .

"(CNN) -- This was not was your typical undercover sting. For starters, it was happening at an Indiana Dairy Queen. And the target was brains. Yeah, a brain bandit. The arrest last month of a 21-year-old suspect uncovered, police say, a macabre scheme to steal the brains of dead mental patients and sell them online. The suspect was peddling some 60 brains. And yes, amazingly there were customers. The arrest in this case also unearthed a few questions. We will try and answer them. Where did the suspect get 60 brains? Suspect David Charles allegedly stole more than 60 jars of brain and other human tissues in October from a warehouse space at the Indiana Medical History Museum, the Marion County prosecutor's office said in court papers Thursday. He is accused of breaking into the museum and taking jars of brains and tissue from autopsies performed on patients in the 1890s. Court documents said some jars were sold on the auction site eBay by a middleman, despite a company policy against listing ""humans, the human body, or any human body parts or products."" Attempts to reach Charles by CNN on Thursday were unsuccessful. He declined to comment outside his Indianapolis home when approached by CNN affiliate WXIN. What do you do with 60 brains? Authorities allege that Charles was scheming to sell some of them, according to court documents. The alleged scheme began to unravel when the executive director of the museum, Mary Ellen Hennessey Nottage, received a call last month from a man in California who said he had purchased ""six jars of brain matter"" for $600 on eBay, according to court documents. The man suspected the jars were stolen when he compared them to others on the museum website. Nottage notified the police. Charles was arrested December 16 after authorities organized an undercover sting. He was charged with felony theft and other charges. He is to appear at an Indianapolis court this month in connection with the alleged theft of dozens of jars of preserved human brain tissue valued at about $4,800. Is it common to purchase brains on eBay? In the universe of bizarre items that Internet users sell on eBay, human organs are forbidden. To buy or sell them is a felony under federal law, and trading in illegal goods is a violation of eBay's rules. The list of prohibited items includes Native American grave-related items such as skulls and skeletons intended for medical research, Tibetan prayer skulls, organs, bones, blood, waste products, body fluids and sperm. Nottage said the California man who allegedly purchased the brains collected oddities. ""Apparently that's a trend that's building -- the macabre, the oddities,"" Nottage said. ""The television reality show 'Oddities' illustrates that very well. I think it's indicative of people's collecting interests. It's definitely bizarre. It's infuriating that they do not have respect for the human remains.""","Indianapolis man charged with theft of human brain samples from medical museum .

"London (CNN) -- An award-winning author has whipped up controversy by describing Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, as a ""machine-made"" doll with a ""plastic smile"" who lacks the personality and human frailty shown by Princess Diana. Hilary Mantel, who has twice won the Man Booker Prize for her historical novels set in Tudor times, made the comments in a talk for the London Review of Books titled ""Royal Bodies,"" looking at how royal lives play out under the public gaze. The furor over her comments came as Catherine carried out her first official engagement since she announced her pregnancy, with a visit to an addiction treatment clinic in London. While there, she told reporters it would be ""unnatural"" if she was not nervous about having a child. The duchess, who is patron of the charity that runs the clinic, Action on Addiction, was briefly hospitalized late last year with acute morning sickness. She and husband Prince William are expecting a baby in July. In her lecture, Mantel described how Catherine's public image was first defined by her clothes, and then her pregnancy. Before she became a mother-to-be, ""I saw Kate becoming a jointed doll on which certain rags are hung,"" Mantel said, and ""a shop-window mannequin, with no personality of her own, entirely defined by what she wore."" Now, she will be portrayed as ""her only point and purpose being to give birth."" The author also suggested the chief attribute brought by Catherine to her royal marriage was good manners, adding that the duchess ""appeared to have been designed by a committee and built by craftsmen, with a perfect plastic smile and the spindles of her limbs hand-turned and gloss-varnished."" And Mantel contrasted that with the potential for disaster that Diana, the late Princess of Wales and mother to princes William and Harry, carried with her, saying Kate was ""irreproachable: as painfully thin as anyone could wish, without quirks, without oddities, without the risk of the emergence of character."" Unlike Diana, ""whose human awkwardness and emotional incontinence showed in her every gesture,"" Mantel said, Kate appears to be ""precision-made, machine-made."" In the first official portrait of the duchess, unveiled by artist Paul Emsley in January, her ""eyes are dead"" and she wears a strained smile, the author added. Mantel was also critical of the public and the media, which, she suggests, place royal women under unhealthy scrutiny, particularly when it comes to producing a royal heir. Nonetheless, her words attracted fierce criticism Tuesday. Royal commentator Robert Jobson dismissed Mantel's remarks as ""a cheap publicity stunt"" and questioned whether she had ever met Catherine or seen her at work. ""People who meet Kate warm to her,"" he told CNN. ""She has a winning smile and easy charm. Yes, she has a long way to go, and is not the new Princess Diana as many in the media are hoping for. ""But I think she is slowly but surely carving out a role for herself."" In the Telegraph newspaper, women's editor Emma Barnett branded Mantel's comments ""not only unfounded, but incredibly cheap."" Opinion: Author's rant on Catherine 'mean and cheap' It is very early days for Kate as a royal, and her image is being carefully managed, Barnett said. ""She has ample time to develop her public persona and become a fully-fledged role model if needs be,"" she said. Nor does Catherine have the luxury of answering criticism, she added. ""As a fully paid-up member of the royal family, she can only respond by doing the very same thing Mantel has criticized her for: staying quiet."" The Daily Mail also blasted Mantel's comments as ""an astonishing and venomous attack."" Mantel's literary agent, Bill Hamilton, said Tuesday the author had no comment on the controversy over her lecture. ""The article speaks for itself,"" he said. Mantel last year became the first woman to twice win the Man Booker Prize, for her novel ""Bring Up the Bodies."" She previously won in 2009 with ""Wolf Hall."" Her novels focus on the Tudors -- and in the lecture, she draws a parallel between the current fascination with Catherine's body and the public scrutiny under which the wives of Henry VIII sought to produce a male heir. Last week, an Italian magazine provoked an uproar in the UK media when it published pictures of a bikini-clad Catherine on vacation, with her ""baby bump"" visible. Palace officials said they were disappointed by what they said was a clear breach of privacy. ""Long before Kate's big news was announced, the tabloids wanted to look inside her to see if she was pregnant,"" Mantel said. ""Cheerful curiosity can easily become cruelty. It can easily become fatal. We don't cut off the heads of royal ladies these days, but we do sacrifice them, and we did memorably drive one to destruction a scant generation ago."" The institution of monarchy may be irrational, Mantel added, but those outside don't have to forget their principles as they observe the ""entertainment"" the royals provide. ""I'm not asking for censorship. I'm not asking for pious humbug and smarmy reverence. I'm asking us to back off and not be brutes,"" she said. Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at the Columbia Journalism School, defended Mantel via Twitter, saying the furor exemplified the author's point about the media's role. ""The Middleton row is caused by the Mail turning Hilary Mantel's rather wonderful lecture into an example of exactly what Mantel warns of..."" she said. CNN's royal correspondent Max Foster and Peter Wilkinson contributed to this report.","NEW: ""She has a winning smile and easy charm,"" royal commentator says of Catherine .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Pushpa Basnet doesn't need an alarm clock. Every morning, the sounds of 40 children wake her up in the two-story home she shares with them. As she helps the children dress for school, Basnet might appear to be a housemother of sorts. But the real story is more complicated. All of these children once lived in Nepal's prisons. This 28-year-old woman has saved every one of them from a life behind bars. Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world -- according to UNICEF, 55% of the population lives below the international poverty line -- so it lacks the social safety net that exists in most Western nations. Space is extremely limited in the few children's homes affiliated with the government. So when no local guardian is available, an arrested parent often must choose between bringing their children to jail with them or letting them live on the streets. Nepal's Department of Prison Management estimates 80 children live in the nation's prisons. ""It's not fair for (these) children to live in the prison because they haven't done anything wrong,"" said Basnet, who started a nongovernmental organization to help. ""My mission is to make sure no child grows up behind prison walls."" Basnet is one of several in Nepal who have started groups to get children out of prison. Since 2005, she has assisted more than 100 children of incarcerated parents. She runs a day care program for children under 6 and a residential home where mostly older children receive education, food, medical care and a chance to live a more normal life. ""I had a very fortunate life, with a good education,"" Basnet said. ""I should give it to somebody else."" Basnet was just 21 when she discovered her calling, she said. While her family ran a successful business, she was studying social work in college. As part of her studies, she visited a women's prison and was appalled by the dire conditions. She also was shocked to discover children living behind bars. One baby girl grabbed Basnet's shawl and gave her a big smile. ""I felt she was calling me,"" Basnet said. ""I went back home and told my parents about it. They told me it was a normal thing and that in a couple of days I'd forget it. But I couldn't forget."" Basnet decided to start a day care to get incarcerated children out from behind the prison walls. While her parents were against the idea at first -- she had no job or way to sustain it financially -- eventually they helped support her. But prison officials, government workers and even some of the imprisoned mothers she approached doubted that someone her age could handle such a project. ""When I started, nobody believed in me,"" Basnet said. ""People thought I was crazy. They laughed at me."" But Basnet was undaunted. She got friends to donate money, and she rented a building in Kathmandu to house her new organization, the Early Childhood Development Center. She furnished it largely by convincing her parents that they needed a new refrigerator or kitchen table; when her parents' replacement would arrive, she'd whisk the old one to her center. Just two months after she first visited the prison, Basnet began to care for five children. She picked them up at the prison every weekday morning, brought them to her center and then returned them in the afternoon. Basnet's program was the first of its kind in Kathmandu; when she started, some of the children in her care had never been outside a prison. Two years later, Basnet established the Butterfly Home, a children's home where she herself has lived for the past five years. While she now has a few staff members who help her, Basnet is still very hands on. ""We do cooking, washing, shopping,"" she said. ""It's amazing, I never get tired. (The children) give me the energy. ... The smiles of my children keep me motivated."" Coordinating all of this is no easy task. But at the Butterfly Home, the older kids help care for the younger ones and everyone pitches in with household chores. The atmosphere feels like an extremely large family, a feeling that's fostered by Basnet, who smothers the children with love. The children reciprocate by calling her ""Mamu,"" which means ""Mommy."" ""I don't ever get a day off, but if I [didn't] have the children around me, it would be hard,"" she said. ""When I'm with them, I'm happy."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . All the children are at the Butterfly Home with the consent of the imprisoned parent. When Basnet hears about an imprisoned child, she'll visit the prison -- even in remote areas of the country -- and tell the parent what she can provide. If the parent agrees, Basnet brings the child back. She is still eager, however, for the children to maintain relationships with their parents. During school holidays, she sends the younger children to the prisons to visit, and she brings them food, clothing and fresh water during their stay. Ultimately, Basnet wants the families to reunite outside prison, and 60 of her children have been able to do just that. Parents like Kum Maya Tamang are grateful for Basnet's efforts. Tamang has spent the last seven years in a women's prison in Kathmandu. When she was convicted on drug charges, she had no other options for child care, so she brought her two daughters to jail with her. When she heard about Basnet's program, she decided to let them go live with her. ""If Pushpa wasn't around, (they) could have never gotten an education ... (they) would have probably had to live on the streets,"" she said. ""I feel she treats (them) the way I would."" Tamang's oldest daughter, Laxmi, said she can't imagine life without Basnet. ""My life would have been dark without her,"" said Laxmi, 14. ""I would've probably always had a sad life. But now I won't, because of Pushpa."" In 2009, Basnet started a program to teach the parents how to make handicrafts, which she sells to raise money for the children's care. Both mothers and fathers participate. It not only gives them skills that might help them support themselves when they're released, but it also helps them feel connected to their children. ""Often, they think that they're useless because they're in prison,"" Basnet said. ""I want to make them feel that they are contributing back to us."" Making ends meet is always a struggle, though. The children help by making greeting cards that Basnet sells as part of her handicraft business. In the past, she has sold her own jewelry and possessions to keep the center going. Her biggest concern is trying to find ways to do more to give the children a better future. She recently set up a bank account to save for their higher educations, and one day she hopes to buy or build a house so they'll always have a place to call home. Their happiness is always foremost in her thoughts. ""This is what I want to do with my life,"" she said. ""It makes me feel (good) when I see that they are happy, but it makes me want to work harder. ... I want to fulfill all their dreams."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- For many fliers Sunday, it was holiday travel woes, round two. As of 6:30 p.m. ET, more than 3,000 U.S. flights were delayed and more than 190 were canceled, according to FlightAware.com. The line for security screening at Chicago Midway International Airport on Sunday morning was so long that reporter Denise Whitaker of CNN affiliate KOMO measured it: 1.2 miles. Traveler Sarah Crowder called it the worst she's seen, prompting the Chicago Tribune's Brian Cassella to call on the Transportation Security Administration to ""do better."" Sunday is one of the busiest travel days of the year, as millions of people return home after the Thanksgiving holiday. ""This happens sometimes,"" Chicago Aviation Department spokeswoman Karen Pride said, according to CNN affiliate WLS. ""There was a period of time earlier this morning, between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m., that lines were long because that is when most people are traveling for the holiday period."" On Wednesday, the weather was widely blamed, as snow snarled traffic for parts of the country. But conditions were much better Sunday in many areas, with ""warmer and more tranquil conditions"" in parts of the country including the East Coast, CNN meteorologist Todd Borek said. The temperatures were in the upper 40s in Chicago. While a lot of attention goes to the airports -- where the interconnected flight travel system can have a domino effect -- the vast majority of Thanksgiving travelers hit the road.

"(CNN) -- You can draw your own conclusions about why Jill Abramson was fired, but as we look at the history of her tenure as executive editor of The New York Times, the world's most prestigious and influential newspaper, and learn details about how it came to an end, women everywhere are shaking their heads. Any woman who has spent time in the work force is familiar with the challenges of being judged and treated fairly by her peers and bosses, of obtaining the recognition she deserves, and of being an effective advocate for one's own career. Women battle to break through the glass ceiling. After that, what comes is walking on broken glass. It's popular now to talk about the need for women to lean in. But, that's not even half the battle. Turns out, as many women have discovered, that leaning in can actually get you sacked. Just hours after NYTimes.com unceremoniously removed Abramson's name from the masthead and Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. told employees she had been replaced, without offering much of an explanation, we learned that Abramson, who had held the job for less than three years, had confronted her bosses about her compensation, telling them she had discovered her total compensation -- salary and benefits -- was substantially lower than that of her predecessor, former editor Bill Keller. The Times quickly shot back, rejecting the pay disparity argument, saying Abramson's total compensation was comparable to Keller's, and that her ""pension benefit, like all Times employees, is based on her years of service and compensation. The pension benefit was frozen in 2009."" Sulzberger issued a statement later saying it wasn't about money and it's not true that Abramson was paid less than her predecessor. He said that in her last year, her total compensation package was more than 10% higher than Keller's in his last year as executive editor. Now it's become she said / he said. But compensation aside, in his announcement on Wednesday, Sulzberger did say his decision had to do with ""an issue with management in the newsroom."" So it's about management. OK. That seems to match a remarkably similar chain of events in Paris, where Natalie NougayrÃ¨de, the editor-in-chief of the prestigious newspaper, Le Monde, was forced out of her job after other journalists accused her of being too authoritarian, or ""Putin-like."" What a curious coincidence. Before Abramson's departure, the personality-driven criticism had wafted out of the Times newsroom, with accusations that reeked of sexism. A few months ago, an article discussed whether she is ""bitchy,"" and the word ""pushy"" keeps coming up. I have spent many years in the news business and I can think of countless successful high-level managers who were pushy, bossy, at times downright cruel with staff. Those men were often viewed as strong, driven, effective, determined, good leaders. The Washington Post's legendary Ben Bradlee was affectionately described as having a ""pugnacious personality."" And Abramson's predecessor, Bill Keller, said his wife describes him as ""socially autistic."" These traits would likely doom a woman's career. In men, they are viewed as quirks, curiosities, even assets in the single-minded pursuit of journalistic success. Men's personalities are fodder for office gossip, but more generally viewed as a secondary matter, perhaps a topic for conversation at the bar after a long day. With women, it infuses their professional persona. People expect women to be nice, likeable or feminine. And it turns out being strong and demanding, and not always warm and friendly, can destroy your career, or at least make for a much less successful one. You cannot win without losing. In order to do a good job, women may find they have to take actions that turn people against them. The problem with the stereotyping that demands women be liked and likeable is that it is much hazier, more difficult to counteract. It often lies hidden below the surface, alongside conscious efforts at equality. The New York Times and Le Monde and other major organizations have made strides to promote women. Abramson was the paper's first female executive editor. Her superior made a landmark decision in promoting her, just as they did with her replacement Dean Baquet, the Times' first African-American executive editor. But the tide of antagonism, the no-win rules that say you fail if you succeed can be found at all levels of the organization, including among rank-and-file staff. By objective standards, Abramson did a fine job. The paper won eight Pulitzer prizes during her brief tenure, with top-notch reporting and investigative journalism. Signups for digital access among readers increased. The company stock doubled during her tenure, performing better than the rest of the stock market. Doing a good job by objective measures, as we know, is not enough. That's especially true for women, who as Sheryl Sandberg pointed out in her book ""Lean In,"" worry about being liked. If it is difficult for women to exercise leadership in order to advance the businesses they lead, that obstacle is a mere bump on the road when compared to the challenge of advocating on their own behalf. We don't know to what extent Abramson's complaint about her compensation was a factor in her firing. But we know just how risky and complicated it is for women to ask for better pay. Women at every level are paid less than their male counterparts. Top female executives make 18% less than their male counterparts. The same is true for female journalists. Trying to change that is excruciatingly difficult. As a recent New York Times article puts it, asking for a promotion or raise can make women seem ""overly demanding and unlikeable"" and not ""sufficiently feminine, unseemly, if on a subconscious level."" It's all incredibly irritating and offensive. And it needs to change. The specific circumstance that brought Jill Abramson's sudden and shockingly undignified fall at the New York Times or Natalie NougayrÃ¨de's exit are almost secondary. The episodes have an ugly ring that is familiar to women. For all the progress we have seen, there is still a long, long way to go.","Jill Abramson, top editor at The New York Times, was fired by the paper's publisher .

"(CNN) -- Teams in Uganda are trying to track down anyone who came into contact with patients infected with the Ebola virus, which has killed at least 14 people there this month, authorities said Monday. ""This is very, very important, to trace every contact and to watch them for an incubation period of 21 days,"" World Health Organization spokesman Gregory Hartl said. The teams -- consisting of officials from Uganda's ministry of health, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO -- are part of an aggressive approach to try to stamp out the outbreak of the highly infectious virus. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni spoke on state and private television Sunday urging his countrymen to be cautious. ""I therefore appeal to you to be vigilant. Avoid shaking of hands; do not take on burying somebody that has died from symptoms which look like Ebola. Instead, call the health workers to be the ones to do it. And avoid promiscuity because these sicknesses can also go through sex,"" he said. This month's outbreak in western Uganda initially went undetected because patients did not show typical symptoms, Health Minister Dr. Christine Ondoa told CNN on Sunday. Patients had fevers and were vomiting, but did not show other typical symptoms, such as hemorrhaging. The Ebola virus is a highly infectious, often fatal agent spread through direct contact with bodily fluids. Symptoms can include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, a measles-like rash, red eyes and, at times, bleeding from body openings. But diagnosis in an individual who has only recently been infected can be difficult since early symptoms, such as red eyes and skin rash, are seen more frequently in patients who have more common diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Uganda's Ministry of Health declared the outbreak in Kibaale district Saturday after getting confirmatory results from the Uganda Virus Research Institute identifying the disease as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Sudan strain. The fatality rate for those infected with that strain is about 65%, Hartl said. ""One can recover, but there's no medicine that can help one recover, so you just have to pray that your own body is strong enough,"" he said. Patients with symptoms of Ebola infection had been reported early in the month in Kibaale district. Some people delayed seeking treatment, in part, because they believed that ""evil spirits"" had sickened them, according to a report from district health authorities. ""This caused civil strife among the community, requiring police intervention to quell the animosity,"" the Health Ministry said. An emergency team of 100 volunteers was undergoing training Monday to help spread the word in vulnerable communities about the disease and its transmission, the Uganda Red Cross Society said in a statement. Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, was helping set up an isolation center at Kibaale's hospital. National health authorities say that in addition to the 14 deaths, at least six other people have been infected. Nine of the deaths were from a single household in the village of Nyanswiga, according to WHO. A medic who had treated other victims is among the dead, Ondoa said. Officials were trying to determine the extent of the outbreak, CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said Sunday. The Atlanta-based organization was sending about five people to join CDC staffers permanently based in Uganda, he said. ""These outbreaks have a tendency to stamp themselves out, if you will, if we can get in and ... stop the chain of transmission,"" he said. In Kibaale, a national task force has been mobilized in an effort to stem the outbreak. As of Monday, two people with the virus remained hospitalized in stable condition, said WHO. One was a 38-year-old woman who had attended to her sister, the medic who died, and the other was a 30-year-old woman who had helped bury another victim. Though both patients had symptoms that included fever, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, neither had shown signs of hemorrhaging, the ministry said Sunday. One patient suspected of being infected with the virus ran away from a hospital Sunday morning, but was tracked to her home and returned to the hospital in Kibaale, Catherine Ntabadde, a spokeswoman for the Uganda Red Cross in Kampala, told CNN in a telephone interview. ""The concern is where she could have gone to when she ran away,"" she said. Health officials urged the public to report any suspected cases, to avoid contact with anyone infected and to wear gloves and masks while disinfecting bedding and clothing of infected people. Officials also advised avoiding public gatherings in the affected district. The WHO did not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Uganda because of the outbreak. The U.S. Embassy in Kampala issued an emergency message for U.S. citizens that said the outbreak appeared to be centered in Nyamarunda Sub County, Kibaale district, although one suspected victim is reported to have traveled to Kampala for treatment at Mulago Hospital, where he died on July 22. It urged avoiding contact with dead animals, especially primates, and refraining from eating ""bushmeat."" An Ebola explainer .

"(CNN) -- It's the stuff of movies. Bad movies. But movies. The kind you watch when it's a Friday night, you're feeling lazy, and, oh look! A bucket of hummus! That kind of movie. A ship. Lost at sea. Abandoned by all humans. Floating untethered into the fog. Infested with hundreds of cannibal rats. Slowly and perilously drifting toward shore. But, you see, this isn't a movie. This is really happening. Maybe. The big fear is that this completely real ghost ship could actually be ready to hit land and unleash rat-feces-palooza on the people of Ireland or the UK, who are, no doubt, just innocently going about their day, doing whatever it is those people do. Like building pretty stone fences and arguing with sheep. (By the way: If Rat-Feces-Palooza isn't already a huge concert event, it should be. Tweet your pick for headlining band with #RatFecesPalooza.) So, here's what happened. Back in 1976, a 4,200-ton cruise ship called the Lyubov Orlova was built in Yugoslavia and was specially designed to sail Russia's elite travelers around the coldest regions on Earth. Because, you know ... Russia. Why go to the Greek Islands when you can spend seven days floating next to an iceberg covered in seal turds? Eventually, though, the private owners of the ship racked up too much debt, and, in 2010, Canadian authorities seized the vessel, which had been docked in St. John's, Newfoundland where it was, presumably, quite bored. Two years later, the Canadians sold it for scrap and began hauling the old girl down to the Dominican Republic so it could be dismantled and possibly turned into steel drums. But then, only one day after leaving port, the towline snapped in heavy seas, and the Lyubov Orlova decided to piss off across the Atlantic. As one does when you have nothing better to do and you're a boat. ""(Sigh) I would like to have seen Montana."" Eventually, another Canadian ship was sent out to corral the wayward vessel in what can only be described as the slowest, crappiest, worst-attended rodeo of all time. But once captured, the Lyubov Orlova was safely hauled farther out to sea, away from Canadian oil rigs. And then they just sort of cut it loose in international waters. Because, hey, what's the worst that could happen? Transport Canada, the government department responsible for roads and planes and trains and SHIPS YOU JUST LET WANDER OFF INTO THE OCEAN, assured its citizens that the Lyubov Orlova ""no longer poses a threat to the safety of [Canadian] offshore oil installations, their personnel, or the marine environment."" As for everyone else and the hundreds of diseased cannibal rats floating around the Atlantic? ""Soory 'boot that, eh."" And, so, the 295-foot ship goes sliding by. Free! But then, in March 2013, two lifeboats suddenly fell off the ship and landed in the water. This automatically triggered warning signals that alerted authorities that, holy crap, this thing had floated two-thirds of the way across the Atlantic and was heading straight toward Britain and Ireland. So, radar operators and pilots went looking for the ship. And they couldn't find it. And, now, months later, several news agencies are reporting that the Lyubov Orlova might actually still be intact and getting closer to land. Probably with rats. Canada's National Post explained that the vessel pretty much sat on it's fat, metal butt in that dock in Newfoundland for over two years, ""virtually guaranteeing"" that the ship is infested with hundreds of these little bastards. And since there's no food on board, the rats have likely turned on each other. ""Damnit, Reggie!"" ""Soorry."" The big fear, now, is that a monster storm might give the ship the extra push it needs to finally make landfall. However, people are still hopeful that they can corral it at sea long before that actually happens. In which case, scrap haulers will have to climb on board and deal with the rats. Which sounds like a lovely way to spend an afternoon. But it's also possible that none of this will happen. The Irish Coast Guard recently released a statement saying: ""There is no further action required by Ireland and there are no reports and sightings."" And the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency pointed out: ""We have received no reported sightings of the vessel since April last year."" Helping to calm fears even more, the BBC reports that maritime analyst Richard Hurley believes the vessel has probably capsized and is now resting at the bottom of the ocean. (Where, I'm told, rats cannot live.) ""There was a report of a EPIRB signal from her,"" Hurley said. ""That's an emergency beacon that normally only activates when the ship has actually sunk."" And if you're still concerned, just know that the official spokesman for British Prime Minister, David Cameron, says that this threat isn't a government priority. When asked if the Navy should intervene, he simply said, ""Gosh, we're almost in a B-movie script development meeting here."" Pass the hummus.

"(CNN) -- The magnitude of the Ebola crisis in West Africa is ""vastly"" underestimated, the World Health Organization warned this week, as the death toll steadily climbed. Ebola has infected at least 2,127 people in Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since the outbreak began this year. Of the victims, 1,145 have died, according to the WHO. It said the number reflects the count as of Wednesday. ""The outbreak is expected to continue for some time,"" the WHO said in a statement Thursday. ""Staff at the outbreak sites see evidence that the numbers of reported cases and deaths vastly underestimate the magnitude of the outbreak."" Though the United Nations agency did not provide an estimate of unreported cases, it said it's teaming up with the affected countries to gather more intelligence from the ground. ""WHO is mapping the outbreak, in great detail, to pinpoint areas of ongoing transmission and locate treatment facilities and supplies,"" the statement said. It's also working with other agencies, including the World Food Program, to feed about 1 million people quarantined in villages in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. ""Our team are not in direct contact with Ebola quarantine and treatment centers,"" said Fabienne Pompey, spokeswoman for World Food Program. ""We deliver food to the medical staff and they are in charge of the distribution."" As experts scramble to contain the outbreak, health officials are considering the use of experimental treatments and vaccines, since no proven ones exist. Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. The deadly virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which affects multiple organ systems. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. They later progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function, and sometimes internal and external bleeding. Two Americans are undergoing treatment for Ebola, which they contracted while helping patients in Liberia. They were transferred to an isolation unit at an Atlanta hospital and appear to be recovering. In a separate case, a Spanish priest who contracted the disease in Liberia died this week.

"(CNN) -- Fresh on the heels of a new immigration law that has led to calls to boycott her state, Arizona's governor has signed a bill banning ethnic studies classes that ""promote resentment"" of other racial groups. Gov. Jan Brewer approved the measure without public statement Tuesday, according to state legislative records. The new law forbids elementary or secondary schools to teach classes that are ""designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group"" and advocate ""the overthrow of the United States government"" or ""resentment toward a race or class of people."" The bill was pushed by state school Superintendent Tom Horne, who has spent two years trying to get Tucson schools to drop a Mexican-American studies program he said teaches Latino students they are an oppressed minority. There was no immediate response from the Tucson Unified School District, the law's main target. Brewer's signature comes less than a month after she approved a state law that requires immigrants to carry their registration documents at all times and allows police to question individuals' immigration status in the process of enforcing any other law or ordinance. Critics of the law say it will lead to racial profiling, while supporters say it involves no racial profiling and is needed to crack down on increasing crime involving illegal immigrants. On Wednesday, the Los Angeles City Council overwhelmingly approved a boycott of Arizona-based businesses and governments unless the state repeals the new immigration law. The city's legislative analyst reported that Los Angeles currently has $56 million in contracts with companies headquartered in Arizona. Several other California cities, including San Francisco and Oakland, have already adopted resolutions requesting city departments to not sign any new contracts with Arizona companies.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Victoria Principal fears the proposed expansion of offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Arctic Ocean could lead to another disastrous oil spill like the one that devastated the U.S. Gulf coast last year. The ""Dallas"" actress is making an ""extremely generous six-figure donations"" to two organizations that lobby against increased offshore oil exploration and for tougher rules for oil companies, those groups said Tuesday. ""Waiting until a disaster happens is waiting until it's too late,"" Principal said in Tuesday's announcement. It is second time Principal has made major donations to both Oceana and the Natural Resource Defense Council. The first was in the summer of 2010 when her money helped put an underwater robot off Florida's Gulf Coast to detect any encroaching oil from the BP oil disaster. ""The strategy and campaign must begin now, in order to achieve success and prevent further devastation from increased offshore drilling and by imposing tougher standards and having improved safeguards firmly in place,"" Principal said. ""I hope others will join me at this crucial juncture in the future of our oceans and our planet."" Oceana and the NRDC said they would use Principal's newest donation in the campaign to prevent drilling off the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, as well as the campaign to ""require critical scientific assessments and demonstrated oil spill response capability in the Arctic before allowing additional leasing."" ""Americans watched in horror and disbelief as millions of gallons of oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico during the BP disaster nearly two years ago,"" NRDC President Frances Beinecke said. ""If we've learned anything from this tragedy, it's that we must not allow it to happen again."" Principal's second donation is key to continuing the fight to protect American coastlines ""in the wake of the disastrous Gulf oil spill, and now on the heels of the Obama Administration's 5-year drilling plan,"" Oceana CEO Andrew Sharpless said. Principal was a celebrity volunteer in June 2010 when a CNN telethon, hosted by Larry King and Ryan Seacrest, raised more than $1.81 million for Gulf Coast oil disaster relief.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A ""furious"" President Obama has ordered a review of the decision to fly a Boeing 747 frighteningly close to the lower Manhattan skyline, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday. Witnesses reported seeing a plane circle over the Upper New York Bay near the Statue of Liberty. The review will focus on ""why that decision was made and to ensure that it never happens again,"" Gibbs said. Jim Messina, a deputy chief of staff, will lead the effort. On Tuesday, Obama told reporters, ""It was a mistake. It was something we found out about along with all of you. And it will not happen again."" Officials said that when Obama first found out about the incident, he was ""furious."" The incident has led to a large amount of criticism from New Yorkers and politicians. After a YouTube video showed panicked New Yorkers scrambling as the plane flew frighteningly close to the lower Manhattan skyline, a former Homeland Security adviser questioned whether the man who approved the flyby should remain in his White House office. Fran Townsend, who advised President George W. Bush for more than three years, called the move ""crass insensitivity"" in the wake of 9/11. ""I'd call this felony stupidity. This is probably not the right job for Mr. Caldera to be in if he didn't understand the likely reaction of New Yorkers, of the mayor,"" Townsend said Tuesday on CNN's ""American Morning."" Louis Caldera, director of the White House Military Office, quickly apologized for Monday's incident after the planes prompted workers and residents to evacuate buildings in New York and New Jersey.  Watch Townsend slam Caldera » . ""Last week, I approved a mission over New York. I take responsibility for that decision,"" Caldera said. ""While federal authorities took the proper steps to notify state and local authorities in New York and New Jersey, it's clear that the mission created confusion and disruption."" The Federal Aviation Administration said the aircraft, which functions as Air Force One when the president is aboard, was taking part in a classified, government-sanctioned photo shoot. On Tuesday Sen. John McCain wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates saying he was ""profoundly disturbed"" by the flyover ""against the backdrop of September 11."" ""The supposed mission represents a fundamentally unsound exercise in military judgment and may have constituted an inappropriate use of Department of Defense resources,"" McCain, a ranking member of the Senate's Armed Services Committee, wrote in the letter. He requested an investigation into the cost of the flyover. Air Force officials estimate that the mission and the photo shoot for the 747 and an accompanying F-16 fighter jet cost $328,835. But they said ""the hours would have been flown regardless, and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission."" An Air Force source told CNN on Tuesday that the White House Military Office planned a photo shoot over various Washington monuments next week, but the shoot has now been canceled. An angry Mayor Michael Bloomberg said it ""defies the imagination"" that an agency would schedule the photo shoot so near the site of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, said the FAA's decision to not announce the flyby ""borders on being either cruel or very, very stupid.""

"(CNN) -- Police have identified those involved in an incident in which the ice bucket challenge trend was used to trick an autistic teenager into being drenched with a bucket of urine, feces and spit. Authorities are not yet releasing the names, and are not discussing potential charges as the investigation is not yet complete, said Bay Village, Ohio, Police Chief Mark Spaetzel.

"(TIME.com) -- Take a look outside your window. Chances are the air you'll see is far cleaner than it was decades ago. Since 1980, levels of ozone pollution — one of the main ingredients in smog — have fallen by 25% in the U.S., while nitrogen dioxide has fallen by 55% and sulfur dioxide by 78%. The change is visual too — the smog-obscured skies that were once a constant backdrop to cities like Los Angeles in the 1960s and '70s are far less common. It's easy to assume that America won the war on air pollution, and to look with pity on developing cities like Beijing and New Delhi where the air is still poisoned. There's just one problem with that sense of satisfaction: the data doesn't back it up. According to a new report from the American Lung Association (ALA), nearly 148 million Americans live in areas where smog and soot particles have led to unhealthy levels of pollution. That means that for almost half of all Americans, simply breathing can be dangerous. Even worse, the report shows that some aspects of air quality have been deteriorating over the past few years in many cities — from 2010 to 2012, ozone worsened in 22 of the 25 biggest metropolitan areas, including cities like New York and Chicago. ""Air pollution is not just a nuisance or the haze we see on the horizon; it's literally putting our health in danger,"" Bonnie Holmes-Gen, senior policy director of the ALA in California, told the Los Angeles Times. ""We've come a long way, but the status quo is not acceptable."" The news is far from all bad. Thanks in part to the retirement of a number of older coal-fired power plants, levels of particulate pollution — soot, in other words — have been dropping in recent years, with cities like Philadelphia and Indianapolis recording their lowest levels yet. And historically, we're far better off — as Brad Plumer notes over at Vox, air pollutants as a whole have fallen 72% since the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, even as the economy, population and energy use have all risen. But as the ALA report makes clear, some of that progress is being lost, in part thanks to climate change — one environmental challenge we're very much not meeting. Rising levels of ozone pollution have been linked to warmer temperatures, which will make it that much tougher to fight smog in the future. And the government could have done more — in 2011, President Barack Obama went against the recommendations of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and rejected a proposal that would have tightened the ozone standard to between 60 and 70 parts per billion. (The level is currently at 75 ppb, set by former President George W. Bush, who was not exactly known as an environmental paragon.) Those regulatory battles matter because it's becoming increasingly clear that healthy air is a moving target. The more scientists learn about the health impacts of air pollution, the more dangerous it appears — even at comparatively low levels. Last October, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared air pollution to be a carcinogen, connecting it directly to lung cancer as well as bladder cancer. And bad air doesn't just hurt the lungs — a raft of studies have connected air pollution, especially soot, to cardiovascular disease, even triggering heart attacks. Even autism has been linked to pollution. In March, the WHO estimated that outdoor air pollution caused 3.7 million premature deaths globally in 2012 — nearly three times the number of people who die each year from tuberculosis. Climate change gets most of the environmental attention, with reason — its effects are already being felt, and it has the potential to radically change our world for the worse. But air pollution is sickening and killing millions of people around the world right now. And unlike global warming, the technological and regulatory solutions to conventional air pollution already exist. That's why it was good news Tuesday when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the EPA's ability to control coal-fired power-plant emissions in 28 states. The decision excited greens because it indicates the court will eventually back even more controversial carbon regulations that the Obama White House is busy formulating now, but the regulation that was upheld — the Cross-State Pollution Rule — will prevent an estimated 45,000 deaths a year from conventional air pollution once it's in place. Air pollution remains stubbornly difficult to eliminate, in part because of the vagary of the wind itself, which separates the victims of pollution from its source. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in her decision yesterday, quoting from the Book of John: ""The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound therof, but canst not tell where it cometh, and whither it goeth."" But if we can't control the air, we can control what we put into it — and protect ourselves.","Report: Nearly 148 million live in U.S. areas with unhealthy smog and soot .

"So ill he could not move, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart supposedly sang parts of his final masterpiece, ""Requiem,"" from his deathbed. Two centuries later, the exact cause of the Austrian composer's premature death, in December 1791 at age 35, is still a mystery. This portrait by painter Johann Georg Edlinger, showed Mozart not long before his mysterious death in 1791. Theories abound. It's known that his entire body was so swollen he couldn't turn over in bed; some say jealous rivals poisoned him, while others suggest scarlet fever, tuberculosis, or lethal trichinosis from undercooked pork. Now, new evidence points to an altogether different conclusion: Mozart may have died from kidney damage caused by a strep infection, possibly strep throat. Health.com: Can't stop coughing? 8 causes of chronic cough . Dr. Richard H.C. Zegers of the University of Amsterdam and his colleagues analyzed data from Vienna's death registry. Researchers had not previously analyzed the daily death registry -- begun in handwritten script in 1607 and maintained until 1920 -- for clues to Mozart's death. Zegers and his team looked at information for 5,011 adults who died during three consecutive winters starting in 1790, as well as eyewitness accounts of Mozart's death, according to the study published this week in Annals of Internal Medicine. ""By looking at the patterns of death during Mozart's time and combining them with the signs and symptoms of his final disease, we have not one but two pillars on which our theory is built,"" said Zegers. ""Although we can't be 100 percent conclusive, I'm convinced that we have come very near the exact reason he died."" The researchers found that there were more than 500 deaths related to edema, the swelling caused by fluid in the body's tissues. Edema was the third most common cause of death at the time, after tuberculosis and malnutrition/cachexia, a physical wasting-away that was possibly caused by cancer or diabetes. Health.com: Your nutrition needs in your 30s, 40s, and 50s . During the winter of 1791, there was a spike in edema-related deaths among younger men, possibly because of an epidemic of strep throat, according to Zegers. He and his colleagues suspect that the epidemic's origin was the local military hospital, since crowded quarters are more conducive to the rapid spread of airborne bacteria such as group A Streptococcus, which can cause strep throat. Strep throat can progress to rheumatic fever, which can lead to heart valve and joint damage; scarlet fever, which is characterized by a skin rash; and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), a condition that causes fluid buildup throughout the body because of kidney damage.  Health.com: How one doctor helps patients avoid kidney problems . Strep bacteria's serious side effects are why today's experts recommend testing and prompt antibiotic treatment of strep, which causes a fiery red throat, severe pain and a high fever. However, most present-day throat infections are caused by viruses (in which case antibiotics are useless), and they often go away without treatment or serious complications. Dr. Martin Schreiber, the head of the nephrology and hypertension department at the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, said that the researchers might be on the right track. ""Is this plausible? Yes,"" said Schreiber. ""But is it definitive? No."" Contrary to previous theories suggesting that Mozart died in extremely rare circumstances, the new study does have a more reasonable conclusion based on what was happening in the community, Schreiber said. ""Using the most credible sources available from that period, they're relying upon deductive reasoning. I'm not sure if there's a more scientific approach to doing this,"" he added. Even though the death registry's data helps shed light on Mozart's cause of death, significant gaps still leave doubt. Many people witnessed the composer's final days, but most of those accounts were published decades after his death. Historians have found no written accounts by Mozart's physicians, and have relied largely on medical reports by a doctor who was familiar with the case -- but didn't treat the composer. Other sources used in the study include a biography written by the composer's wife's second husband, Georg Nikolaus von Nissen, and an eyewitness account given by Mozart's sister-in-law, Sophie Haibel, 33 years after his death. Dr. Stephen Gluck, a nephrologist at the University of California, San Francisco, finds some faults with the new theory: There are no accounts of Mozart suffering from a sore throat in the last weeks of his life; nor were there reports of high blood pressure or blood in his urine. All are telltale signs of APSGN. Gluck adds that APSGN now occurs mainly in children and is nonfatal in most cases. Mozart's cause of death is listed on the city's official registry as hitziges Frieselfieber, or miliary fever, a condition whose symptoms include a high temperature and rash. Zegers suggested this guess was made by a layperson instead of a medical authority because it was a term widely used to describe symptoms instead of an actual medical diagnosis. Although a rash is a symptom of scarlet fever, which is also caused by strep bacteria, it's more likely that Mozart's death was due to strep throat, Zegers said. None of the people who were with him during the last weeks of life reported that he had a rash, suggesting that he had the rash only at the time of his death. Scarlet fever's rash shows up the first or second day after you get sick and then subsides within six to nine days, said Zegers, so that condition is unlikely to have been the cause of death. Health.com: Four things you didn't know about natural medicine . What's more, Mozart was reported to have had a fever in the fall of 1791, which may have been caused by the initial strep infection, the researchers say. Some strep complications can occur weeks after the initial infection, and it's possible that Mozart had a sore throat before or at the time of his death and it wasn't recorded.

"(CNN) -- Episcopal priests will be allowed to conduct services blessing same-sex relationships under a policy approved Tuesday at the church's national convention in Indianapolis. The convention's House of Bishops approved the provisional policy 111-41 with three abstentions Monday, clearing it for consideration by the House of Deputies, which approved it Tuesday evening. The policy was approved in the House of Deputies, following more than an hour of debate, by 78% of the voting lay members and by 76% of clergy. Can 'true Catholics' favor same-sex marriage? With the vote, the Episcopal Church becomes the largest U.S. denomination to officially sanction same-sex relationships. The Episcopal Church has about 1.95 million members in the United States, down 16% over the last decade, according to the church. The service is not considered a marriage ceremony, media affairs representative Nancy Davidge said. ""We have authorized a blessing, and a blessing is different than a marriage,"" she said. ""A blessing is a theological response to a monogamous, committed relationship."" Marriage requires the additional involvement of civil authorities, and many states do not allow gays to marry. The Episcopal policy calls for a three-year trial run of the blessing service, which is called ""The Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant."" It will be accompanied by a review process leading up to the church's next annual convention in Salt Lake City. It's then that church leaders would decide whether to make the policy permanent, church media affairs representative Neva Rae Fox said. The vote in the House of Deputies followed comments, including from advocates arguing the policy would be a step toward inclusiveness. Delegate Pete Ross of Michigan said it was time for the church to honor lifelong commitments of people in same-sex relationships. ""The signs outside our church says all are welcome. Do we need an asterisk?"" But the Rev. David Thurlow of South Carolina said the policy advocates a ""new theology"" of human sexuality that is inconsistent with church canons and doctrine. The approval means the church is ""marching off, not simply out of step, but completely out of line from the faith once delivered to the saints,"" Thurlow said before the vote. The policy, which has been in development since 2009, allows local bishops to decide whether to allow the service. It also includes a provision stating that clergy members who object to same-sex unions cannot be coerced to perform the blessing, or be disciplined for refusing. As with civil politics, issues involving homosexuality have roiled American churches for years. In 2003, the Episcopal Church in the United States split over the election of an openly gay priest, Eugene Robinson, as bishop in New Hampshire. And in 2009, the church approved a policy allowing the ordination of homosexual Episcopalians as priests. Just this summer, the Presbyterian and Methodist churches rejected measures that would have granted formal church recognition to gay relationships. The United Methodist Church, at its General Conference meeting in Tampa, Florida, upheld the church's position on homosexuality, which excludes gay marriages and same-sex unions. The Methodist body also rejected a proposal saying the church is not of one mind on the issue of homosexuality. Tech is getting more gay-friendly . This month in Pittsburgh, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church USA decided not to change the church's definition of marriage as being ""between a man and a woman."" Delegates approved a two-year study of the issue. The only major U.S. denomination to endorse same-sex marriage across the board is the United Church of Christ, which did so in 2005. In 2009, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America allowed member churches to recognize same-sex relationships, but stopped short of creating a churchwide policy or crafting a specific blessing service. During Monday's debate, Bishop Nathan Baxter of Central Pennsylvania said the policy would allow the church to focus on inclusion while respecting theological differences within the church, according to the Episcopal News Service. But others said the policy was a bad idea, the news service reported. ""The Christian world is going to understand us as having changed the nature of the sacrament of holy matrimony,"" the news service quoted Bishop Edward Little of Northern Indiana as saying. ""The Christian world will look at that liturgy world and see vows, and exchange of rings, a pronouncement and a blessing and they will understand that to mean the Episcopal Church has endorsed same-sex marriage and changed a basic Christian doctrine. I do not believe that we are free to do that."" Randall Balmer, a Dartmouth University religion professor and an Episcopal priest who supports the change, said he expects little fallout from the policy within the American church. Most of the most conservative Episcopalians who oppose blessing same-sex relationships have probably already left the church, he said. ""In many ways, the church is tracking public sentiment,"" which is increasingly supportive of same-sex relationships, Balmer said ahead of Tuesday's vote. ""The Episcopal Church is merely part of that trend.""

"(CNN) -- Democrats are taunting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for effectively allowing them a victory on a controversial nominee for surgeon general. Physician Vivek Murthy was confirmed Monday night on a 51-43 vote despite stiff opposition from the National Rifle Association, due in large part to Cruz's unsuccessful maneuver this weekend meant to register GOP opposition to Obama's executive action on deportations. The Texas Republican kept his colleagues in the Capitol through Saturday, intending to get a vote on whether the President's move was constitutional. With the Senate in session, Democrats were able to clear procedural barriers in the nomination process, originally thought to be too time consuming to finish before the Christmas recess. Cruz's keeping the Senate open allowed Democrats to clear those steps on a number of presidential nominees, some of them controversial, making it easier for them to win final confirmation this week. Murthy had long faced fierce opposition from Republicans, and particularly the gun lobby, for a letter he had signed calling for stricter gun control policies, and because he launched the pro-Obamacare group Doctors for America. So when he was confirmed on Monday night, Democrats could barely contain their glee â€”Â expressing it in part on Twitter. The Senate Democrats' account blamed both Cruz and Utah Sen. Mike Lee, both of whom forced their colleagues to stay in session through the weekend. Opinion: Surgeon general's win is a political miracle . White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer, former Obama campaign manager David Axelrod and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's communications director, Adam Jentleson, all joined in the chorus. Cruz spokeswoman Amanda Carpenter responded in similar fashion, suggesting Cruz's gambit ultimately didn't matter. But the progressive group Center for American Progress saw it differently. .","Vivek Murthy was confirmed Monday night on a 51-43 vote as the next Surgeon General .

"(CNN) -- Pop star Madonna is causing a commotion in Malawi, days after her return from a goodwill trip to the nation. The singer is in a bitter feud with the government over accusations that she demanded VIP treatment, including at the airport, while visiting last week. Madonna asked to meet the president and she believed Malawi ""should have abandoned everything and ... rolled out a red carpet and blasted the 21-gun salute in her honor,"" the government said in a statement. A government spokesman also accused her of overstating her contributions, saying she announced that she built schools in the nation while she only helped construct classrooms in existing facilities. Malawi officials blast Madonna's school plans . The pop star shot down the reports as inaccurate, and pledged to continue helping educate young girls in the nation. Madonna adopted a son from Malawi in 2006, and her ties to the nation run deep. In addition to adopting a daughter three years later, she has several education projects in the nation. They include the documentary, ""I Am Because We Are,"" which highlights diseases devastating children in the country. She also co-founded a nonprofit group, Raising Malawi, to help educate and provide programs to help the needy. Despite her charitable involvement and fame, the government said, it is not obligated to give her special treatment. ""Madonna feels that the Malawi government and its leadership should have abandoned everything and attended to her because she believes she is a music star turned benefactor,"" Tusekele Mwanyongo, a government spokesman, said in a statement posted by the nation's media outlets. ""Granted, Madonna is a famed international musician. But that does not impose an injunction of obligation on any government ... to give her state treatment. Such treatment, even if she deserved it, is discretionary not obligatory."" The spokesman did not provide specific details on what kind of special treatment Madonna reportedly asked for. ""I'm saddened that Malawi's President Joyce Banda has chosen to release lies about what we've accomplished, my intentions, how I personally conducted myself while visiting Malawi and other untruths,"" Madonna said in a statement. ""I have no intentions of being distracted by these ridiculous allegations. I came to Malawi seven years ago with honorable intentions. I returned earlier this month to view the new schools we built. I did not ever ask or demand special treatment at the airport or elsewhere during my visit."" In her statement, Madonna said the animosity is a result of her history with the president's sister, Anjimile Mtila Oponyo, who once headed Raising Malawi. Oponyo was later fired, and sued the nonprofit for wrongful termination. ""Madonna is not letting politics stand in the way of her deep commitment to help build schools there and educate as many children as possible,"" said Liz Rosenberg, the singer's publicist. Malawian officials dismissed the implication that their discontent was based on her relationship with the president's sister. Raising Malawi at first planned to build a major girls academy, but later revised its goal and joined buildOn to construct smaller schools in villages. The two groups say they've built 10 schools so far, all in 2012. Madonna visited the nation with her children, including son David Banda and daughter Chifundo James, both of whom were adopted from Malawi. The Malawian president, a longtime women's rights activist and former vice president, came to office last year after the death of her predecessor.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Top Bush administration officials gave the CIA approval to use waterboarding, a controversial interrogation technique, as early as 2002, a Senate intelligence report shows. Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice were among the officials who OK'd the use of waterboarding, a report says. On July 17, 2002, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, who later became secretary of state, said the CIA could proceed with ""alternative interrogation methods,"" including waterboarding, when questioning suspected al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah. The decision was contingent on the Justice Department's determining the method's legality. A week later, Attorney General John Ashcroft had determined the ""proposed interrogation techniques were lawful,"" the report said. The same techniques also were used in the interrogations of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the first person charged in the United States in the 2000 attack on the destroyer USS Cole in Yemen that killed 17 U.S. sailors, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the suspected mastermind behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.  Watch how Rice's role has emerged » . The release of the report, prepared by the attorney general's office at the request of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, details and declassifies the advice given to the CIA regarding its interrogation techniques. The techniques again gained the endorsement of the Bush administration in spring 2003 when the CIA asked for a ""reaffirmation of the policies and practices in the interrogation program."" In a meeting that included Vice President Dick Cheney, CIA Director George Tenet, Ashcroft, Rice and their legal counsels, ""the principals reaffirmed that the CIA program was lawful and reflected administration policy,"" the report said. President Obama has called waterboarding -- which simulates drowning -- torture and last week released a series of Bush-era memos on interrogation tactics. One memo showed that CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on Zubaydah and Mohammed. In a 2008 interview with ABC, Cheney defended the practice of waterboarding, now banned by the Obama administration, particularly in the case of Mohammed. ""Did it produce the desired results? I think it did,"" Cheney said.  Watch what Hillary Clinton says about Cheney » . ""Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ... provided us with a wealth of information. There was a period of time there, three or fours years ago, when about half of everything we knew about al Qaeda came from that one source. ""So it's been a remarkably successful effort,"" he said. ""I think the results speak for themselves."" More recently, Cheney said some people are more interested in reading terrorists their rights than protecting the United States, a dig at the new administration. Cheney this week called Obama's release of the Bush memos ""disturbing"" and said the administration is sitting on other CIA memos that show that the interrogations helped stop terror attacks.  Watch what Cheney says about Obama » . ""They didn't put out the memos that show the success of the effort, and there are reports that show specifically what we gained as a result of this activity,"" Cheney told Fox News on Monday.

"(CNN) -- U.N. forces withdrew Monday from the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan Heights, the world body confirmed. The U.N. statement cited the ""exceptionally challenging environment"" posed by armed rebel groups advancing on peacekeeping positions its observer force has held for close to four decades. The confirmation comes hours after a journalist working for CNN saw dozens of peacekeeping vehicles crossing into territory controlled by Israel. The withdrawal comes a little more than two weeks after Islamic militant fighters took some peacekeepers hostage and besieged others. Al-Nusra Front freed 45 U.N. peacekeepers from Fiji in good condition last week, while forces from the Philippines escaped after exchanging fire with militant fighters, according to media reports. The incidents occurred after Syrian rebel fighters took control of the only border crossing between Israel and Syria in the Syrian town of Quneitra in late August. U.N. forces have been stationed in the Golan Heights since 1974 following negotiations between Israel and Syria to reduce tensions along their shared border after hostilities in 1973. Israel has occupied a portion of the territory since seizing it during its 1967 war with Egypt, Jordan and Syria. The U.N. Disengagement Observer Force includes 1,250 troops from six countries. In addition to Fiji and the Philippines, India, Nepal, Ireland and the Netherlands have troops assigned to the force. Austrian troops who had been taking part in the forces in 2013 pulled out after fighting in the Syrian-controlled Golan Heights between rebels and Syrian government forces.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When Lijia Zhang was 10-years old, her mother told her babies are born from armpits. ""I thought that's strange, because there's no hole there,"" Zhang recalls, adding that she ""had absolutely nothing"" in terms of sex ed when she was growing up in Nanjing in the 1970s, beyond what her mother told her. Now a journalist writing for English-language publications, Zhang publicly revealed her own experience of molestation by a schoolteacher in a recent opinion piece on the severity of child sex abuse in China. Zhang is part of a growing number of voices calling for better sex education to combat child sex abuse, rising rates of sexually transmitted diseases, and unwanted pregnancies. ""With so little sex education and knowledge, you become very vulnerable to abuse,"" says Zhang. Sex education is taught inadequately in school and avoided by parents, resulting in generations of Chinese children growing up wondering if babies come out of armpits, or from the garbage dump, as others have also cited. ""We've never had a class on sex ed at my school. We're not even allowed to have a boyfriend or a girlfriend. No kissing, nothing,"" says Sun Meimei, an 18-year-old student at a top boarding school in wealthy Chengdu. Her teachers simply told her she would ""be in trouble"" if she had a boyfriend. No incentive . Typically, Chinese students are taught the basic anatomical differences between the sexes and little else. There's no real incentive for educator or student to learn about it. It then becomes a vicious cycle: no one learns about it so no one is in a position to later teach it. But the puritanical classrooms hardly translate to a prudish society. A 2012 survey by the Qiushi journal showed that 70% of Chinese have engaged in pre-marital sex, up from just 15% of those surveyed in 1989. Top-down efforts to make sex education part of the compulsory education curriculum were seen at the CPPCC this past March when two committee members spoke out about the issue. Meanwhile, Chinese Internet users have taken matters into their own hands, posting videos that teach crucial sex facts in one-minute clips, with some going viral and being watched millions of times. Nothing to be desired . The repercussions of a population in the dark about the bedroom are vast. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are on the ascent and China has particularly high rates of syphilis, while sexual transmission now accounts for 81.7% of all new HIV infections. Unwanted pregnancies are also rife. China has a staggering 13 million annual abortions, according to recent data published by China's National Health and Family Planning Commission in 2013. In one instance a teenage girl underwent 13 abortions. These numbers would lower significantly if Chinese women knew how to use contraception effectively -- but most don't. The lack of sex education plagues rural and urban areas equally. Meizhen Wu is a market researcher, investigating sexual health as part of her job. She had never heard of the human papilloma virus (HPV), a commonly transmitted STD responsible for 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. Wu only found out about it when her company put her in charge of work related to the HPV vaccine, which in China, is only available in Hong Kong. Wu remembers her own sex education. It consisted of watching one 45-minute-long video explaining sexual differences between boys and girls. The video was counterproductive. Wu says it reinforced gender stereotypes of girls as passive and boys as active and aggressive. Herein lies a dark consequence of poor sex education: females are particularly compromised. A recent report from the United Nations revealed a shocking 22.2% of 998 Chinese males surveyed had raped a woman. Children also don't have the knowledge to protect themselves from unwanted sexual attention. A total of 125 cases of sexual assault on children were reported in 2013. Richard Burger, author of ""Behind the Red Door: Sex in China,"" says knowledge is as important for empowering potential victims as it is for curbing aggressors. ""Better sexual education would teach men to respect women more and be sensitive to their sexual needs, including the right to say 'no,'"" he says. Dirty talk . When the Communists came to power in 1949, talking about sex became strictly taboo. It was erased from public life, especially during the Cultural Revolution when men and women squeezed into gender-neutral Mao jackets and all energy was directed towards the revolutionary cause. This changed during China's opening up period starting in the mid-1970s. As years of state-sponsored puritanism began to dissolve, the first sex education courses were instated in Shanghai, in 1981. The same year saw the Ministry of Education announcing sex ed classes would be established in all middle schools throughout the country. Even then, the government preached abstention over indulgence. For example, the 1988 sex education charter warned adolescents of the dangers of premarital sex. Ultimately, a prudish attitude prevails and as yet no standardized and authoritative teaching materials have been issued on the topic. The government approach dovetails with its concerns over ""polluted"" and ""unhealthy"" material: References to sex, including kissing, are constantly edited out of public life, such as the sex scenes cut from Ang Lee's ""Lust, Caution"" or more recently, the censoring of an on-stage lesbian kiss during the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest. Educators have also largely ignored what calls the government has made to improve sex education. In part, teachers are too embarrassed to cover the subject, but primarily they concentrate on meeting their own academic targets. Sex is not a subject tested in the all-important university entrance exam and teachers have little incentive to emphasize the subject. ""At school the focus is to get students to score high in exams in order to get them into good universities. Sex education is not considered important,"" Zhang explains. Parents spur this on, pressuring their children to concentrate on academics above all else. Zhang adds that Confucian thought doesn't encourage open discussion of sex. As a popular saying goes: ""Lust is the worst of all wicked things; Filial piety is the best of all good things."" TCM obstacles . Traditional Chinese medicine offers advice on coitus that can be at odds with modern science -- again impeding honest talk about sex. ""There are big gaps between western concepts and Chinese traditional culture,"" says Tao Lin, president of the World Association of Chinese Sexologists. Within traditional Chinese thought, semen is believed to be more precious than blood, with one drop said to equal 10 drops of blood. Excessive sexual activity that causes the loss of semen from the body is thought to be harmful, explains Tao. The combination of misinformation and lack of teachers who are qualified on the subject is toxic, says Tao. ""Contradictions arise between radical and conservative, right and wrong. The radical may explain the use of condoms in middle school while the conservative still insist on abstinence in college. Someone says puppy love is beneficial, while someone says puppy love should be prohibited,"" says Tao. He adds that only one college in the country -- Capital Normal University -- offers an academic minor in sex education. Protecting the future . With few avenues for young Chinese to turn to for information, the Internet and the arts have become key educators. An online survey showed that 88% of Chinese youth polled said they had learned about sex on their own. There are signs of change. In light of child abuse cases, the issue of China's poor sex education has recently gained traction. There's growing support amongst parents for improvements and the government released a teaching outline in March for sex education lessons. It offers step-by-step guidance on how to instruct primary school children to better protect themselves from sexual abuse. Many NGOs are also aiding the dissemination of knowledge. Tao's organisation is one example, but he lists a series of other social organizations, such as the Ford Foundation and Path, who have all done ""a great deal to promote sex education in China."" Lily Liu Liqing, country director from NGO Marie Stopes, which was established in China in 2000, says they aim ""to empower young people to have open and informed attitudes towards love, sex and life"" through a series of services. Their best known initiative is the You&Me clinics, where young people can receive information on family planning.","Sex-related social issues on the rise in China, including sexual assault, STDs, unwanted pregnancies .

"SOCHI, Russia (CNN) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has accused the United States of orchestrating the conflict in Georgia to benefit one of its presidential election candidates. Russian PM Vladimir Putin has accused the U.S. of orchestrating the conflict in Georgia. In an interview in the Black Sea city of Sochi on Thursday, Putin said the U.S. had encouraged Georgia to attack the autonomous region of South Ossetia. Putin said his defense officials had told him it was done to benefit a presidential candidate -- Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama are competing to succeed George W. Bush -- although he presented no evidence to back it up. ""U.S. citizens were indeed in the area in conflict,"" Putin said. ""They were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered, and the only one who can give such orders is their leader.""  Watch Putin accuse the United States » . White House spokeswoman Dana Perino blasted Putin's statements, saying they were ""patently false."" ""To suggest that the United States orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational,"" she said. U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Robert Wood concurred and labeled Putin's statements ""ludicrous."" ""Russia is responsible for the crisis,"" Wood said in Washington on Thursday. ""For the Russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in Georgia is ludicrous. ... Russia is to blame for this crisis, and the world is responding to what Russia has done."" When told that many diplomats in the United States and Europe blame Russia for provoking the conflict and for invading Georgia, Putin said Russia had no choice but to invade Georgia after dozens of its peacekeepers in South Ossetia were killed. He told Chance it was to avert a human calamity. iReport.com: First-person accounts from the center of the conflict . The former Russian president, still considered the most powerful man in the country, said he was disappointed that the U.S. had not done more to stop Georgia's attack. Putin recalled that he was watching the situation in Georgia and South Ossetia unfold when he was at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games on August 8. He said he spoke to U.S. President Bush, also attending, who told the Russian prime minister he didn't want war, but Putin spoke of his disappointment that the U.S. administration didn't do more to stop Georgia early in the conflict. Also Thursday, Putin announced economic measures that he said were unrelated to the fighting with Georgia. Nineteen U.S. poultry meat companies would be banned from exporting their products to Russia because they had failed health and safety tests, and 29 other companies had been warned to improve their standards or face the same ban, Putin said. Putin said Russia's health and agricultural ministries had randomly tested the poultry products and found them to be full of antibiotics and arsenic. Putin repeated that the bans were not related to the Georgian conflict, but they indicate the measures that some Western countries -- particularly in Europe -- fear if Russia goes on a diplomatic offensive.

"(CNN) -- Starbucks lauds itself as a company committed to operating responsibly and ethically, and many of its policies reflect a strong corporate conscience. But when it comes to responsible gun policy, Starbucks has lost its moral compass. Starbucks refuses to ban loaded guns from its coffee shops in the 43 states that allow people to openly carry loaded weapons. As mothers, we wonder why the company is willing to put children and families in so much danger. Nobody needs to be armed to get a cup of coffee. And that's why thousands of moms across the nation are asking Starbucks to put the safety of its customers first. We've started a petition asking Starbucks to ban guns from its stores. In response, Starbucks has referred concerned moms to a statement on its website, a statement last updated in March 2010, about 90,000 American gun deaths ago. The statement reads, ""The political, policy and legal debates around these issues belong in the legislatures and courts, not in our stores."" Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson recently told Seattle Weekly that it is a legal strategy. ""In communities that permit open carry, we abide by local laws. Where these laws don't exist, openly carrying weapons in our stores is prohibited."" Moms don't want a gun debate with our coffee either. But when children are shot in schools, in movie theaters and even at Fourth of July parades, we can no longer keep the debate in the places where they ""belong."" As the debate on guns spreads to town hall meetings nationwide in August, do we really have to have one in Starbucks too? Starbucks' refusal to ban guns from its stores has made it a nationwide venue for pro-gun rallies, where customers toting loaded weapons gather over coffee. There have even been accidental shootings: earlier this year a woman shot another customer when she dropped her purse and a loaded weapon inside discharged. A pro-gun site called I Love Guns and Coffee sells a coin that looks like the Starbucks logo, except the mermaid is wielding handguns. On Sunday, for example, 60 pro-gun activists carried handguns, semi-automatic rifles and shotguns into a Starbucks in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Starbucks claims its open carry policy simply follows state laws and local ordinances. However, the company is willing to overlook those in other instances; it recently announced a smoking ban within 25 feet of any store. Why is Starbucks willing take a public health stand on smoking, but not gun violence, which kills more than 55 children and teens a week in America? Since when is second-hand smoke more dangerous than second-hand bullets? Starbucks also claims that banning guns from its stores would put its employees in a ""potentially unsafe position"" if they had to ask a gun-wielding customer to leave. This alleged concern has not stopped other companies -- including Disney, California Pizza Kitchen, AMC Theaters, Toys R Us, and even Starbucks competitor Peet's Coffee & Tea -- from prohibiting guns in their stores in states where open carry is legal. In fact, these companies have banned guns in order to keep employees and customers safe. Starbucks bans guns from its corporate headquarters in Seattle, where open carry is perfectly legal. This same protection should be afforded to the millions of unarmed customers Starbucks serves each week. An overwhelming majority of Americans want common-sense gun reforms. But it's not just Congress and state legislatures that impact society; business policies also affect our safety. Shame on Congress for failing to act, but that's no excuse for companies like Starbucks to fail to lead. We never saw ourselves becoming activists. But like so many mothers on December 14th, we were horrified by the Sandy Hook shootings. The realization that our country's lax gun laws led to the massacre of 20 innocent children shook both of us to the core. As mothers, we cannot and will not abide politics and policies that needlessly put our children and other children in danger. Moms Demand Action has become a rallying point for mothers across the nation who refuse to tolerate the inaction over the epidemic of gun violence. We will not stop until gun reforms and responsible policies are in place at the federal level, in our states and at American businesses. We have the most important reason of all for never backing down -- our kids. Risking their safety isn't worth a nonfat misto at Starbucks. Women make the vast majority of spending decisions in America; you can be sure we'll spend those dollars with companies that value the safety of our families.

"(CNN) -- Calling attention to a logjam of stalled diplomatic nominations in the Senate, Secretary of State John Kerry said the delay is harming U.S. national security. In direct public commentary on an issue crossing politics and diplomacy, Kerry called for swift approval of the nominees, many of whom are career diplomats. Some were selected for difficult jobs in global hotspots. ""Make no mistake: Vacancies in so many world capitals send a dangerous message to allies and adversaries alike about America's engagement,"" Kerry said in an opinion piece for Politico on Tuesday. ""This perception makes it much more difficult to do the nonpartisan work at the heart of U.S. foreign policy â€” defending the security of our nation, promoting our values and helping our businesses compete to create American jobs back home,"" he added. Fifty-three State Department nominees await confirmation. Nearly two thirds are uncontroversial career diplomats who are caught up in a partisan standoff that has nothing to do with them or the jobs they've been tapped to undertake. Democrats lead the chamber and accuse Republicans of delaying confirmation votes as payback for new rules aimed at making it easier to break Republican filibusters on nominations. Republicans require separate votes for each nominee, rather than the customary practice of allowing votes on multiple names at once. White House spokesman Josh Earnest urged Senate Republicans to, ""stop playing political games and let these individuals get to work on behalf of the American people."" But Republicans blame the other side. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio said the GOP has no choice but to take the slow approach. ""The leaderships on the Democratic side of the aisle has chosen, for the first time ever, at least in modern history, to say, 'You know, Republicans are not going to have a voice in these nominees,'"" Portman said of the rules change. Now, Kerry is urging members of both parties to cooperate and act swiftly. Some 40 countries are awaiting permanent ambassadors, including Qatar and Kuwait, Gulf allies whose cooperation is critical to the fight against extremists in Iraq. Embassies in Honduras and Guatemala are also waiting for new ambassadors at a time when unaccompanied minors from Central America are surging across the southern border, creating what the White House calls a humanitarian crisis. And in Africa, nearly a quarter of U.S. missions are awaiting permanent ambassadors. Those include Cameroon and Niger, where the State Department insists the lack of American leadership has hampered efforts to recover hundreds of schoolgirls abducted by the Boko Haram extremist group in neighboring Nigeria this year. ""Ambassadors are there for a reason,"" Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Linda Thomas-Greenfield told CNN. ""They speak for the President. They speak for the administration. Not having those voices on the ground has made a difference in our ability to convey the messages we need to convey to these governments.""

"(CNN) -- I keep thinking of those television ads from the Mexican tourism industry urging Americans to ""Come visit Mexico."" Visiting isn't difficult. For some Americans, it's leaving that's the problem. For years, U.S. officials have urged their Mexican counterparts to get tough on drug traffickers. The Americans even provided $1.4 billion through the Merida Initiative to help our friends south of the border accomplish that goal. Yet, the drama that unfolded in the state of Sonora for the last week can't be what U.S. officials had in mind. The idea was to help Mexico's police and military pursue violent criminals -- the sort who terrorize people by scattering human heads like party favors on the dance floors of nightclubs -- not to prey on Americans held for ransom by crooked cops looking for their next payday. And that seems to be what happened to Yanira Maldonado, a 42-year-old U.S. citizen who spent the last several days sitting in a women's prison in Nogales, Mexico, on what looks like bogus drug charges. Maldonado, a Mormon with seven children and two grandchildren, was released late Thursday when a judge concluded what was already evident to most of us -- that the Mexican authorities had no evidence to hold her. The family's nightmare is over. It began last week when the Mexican-born Yanira and her husband, Gary, boarded a bus to head back to the United States after attending her aunt's funeral in Mexico. That was their first mistake. Those of us who visit Mexico know you never get on a bus. It makes you easy pickings for bandits and bad cops, and sometimes you can't tell the difference. Bandits might take your money, and let you go on your way. Bad cops take your liberty, and hold it until someone back home sends enough money to let you go on your way. Either way, it's not personal. It's just a business transaction. But it's a cruel and ugly business. Anyway, back to the bus. It came up to a military checkpoint -- which might as well be a toll booth -- and everyone was taken off the bus as soldiers boarded it. ""I was at the checkpoint, asked to get off bus,"" Yanira told CNN from prison. ""They were checking for drugs and I don't know what else. They say they found something under the seat but I never saw anything. They didn't show me anything. It was amazing all what they did."" The soldiers claim that they found a package containing 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) of what appeared to be marijuana under Yanira's seat. And so they placed her under arrest, and handed the case over to the Mexican attorney general's office for prosecution. Maybe drugs were there before she ever sat down. Or maybe the soldiers put the drugs there. Or maybe there were no drugs at all. No one knows, because, conveniently, the only people on the bus were the soldiers. Gary Maldonado has said that he and his wife checked their bags, and boarded with no luggage. He says that when his wife was taken into custody, one of the soldiers told him matter-of-factly that it would cost him $5,000 to get her released. Later, according to family members, he was quoted the same price by civilian authorities -- $5,000 -- for her release, whether she was found guilty or not. That's how it works. Think of it as a processing fee. In Mexico, stories like this one -- which are all about money, and corruption, and how predatory some hungry people can be when they catch a glimpse of a piece of bread -- are as common as pinatas and margaritas. But that's not supposed to be the case anymore. I was in Mexico City in November on a mission sponsored by the American Jewish Committee. We met with top officials, including President Enrique Pena Nieto, and the message could not have been clearer. ""With a booming economy, less crime in metropolitan areas, and the reins of power now back in the hands of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the country is open for business. This is the new Mexico."" Sorry folks, it seems there are still unseemly remnants of the old Mexico, and they are threatening to undermine the makeover. The Maldonados probably aren't thinking about the relationship between the United States and Mexico at the moment. They're just glad to have a wife and mother home with her family. This ugly chapter, in their lives and in the U.S.-Mexico relationship, is finally closed. Incidentally, Mexico is still waiting on the last few hundred million dollars in drug fighting funds promised under the Merida Initiative. Congress should send the rest of the money. Minus $5,000. That should go to the Maldonado family. Think of it as a processing fee.

"(CNN) -- ""Jackass"" star Ryan Dunn was drunk and speeding up to 140 mph when his 2007 Porsche 911 GT3 crashed and caught fire on a Pennsylvania highway early Monday, police said Wednesday. Dunn and Zachary Hartwell, a 30-year-old West Chester, Pennsylvania, man who once worked in one of Ryan's movies, died from ""blunt and thermal trauma"" in the fiery crash, according to the autopsy report released Tuesday. ""The initial crash reconstruction investigation determined that Mr. Dunn's vehicle was traveling between 132-140 mph at the time of the collision,"" West Goshen Police Chief Michael Carroll said in a statement Wednesday. Toxicology testing by the coroner indicated Dunn's blood alcohol concentration was 0.196%, which is more than twice the legal state limit of 0.08, Carroll said. The red-bearded Dunn, 34, was famous for his pranks and dangerous stunts on the show, which evolved into a successful film franchise. Hartwell worked as a stunt car driver on ""Minghads,"" a 2009 comedy directed by ""Jackass"" star Bam Margera and featuring Dunn, according to the Internet Movie Database. West Goshen Police were called to the wreck scene on State Route 322 at 2:30 a.m. Monday, the police report said. ""Upon arrival, police located one vehicle off the road and in the woods that was fully engulfed in flames,"" the report said. Dunn was driving the Porsche, which was registered in his name, police said. A photo of Dunn was posted on his Twitter account about two hours before the wreck showing him with a drink in his hand. Two men sitting with Dunn in the photo are not identified. The manager of Barnaby's in West Chester confirmed that the photo was taken in his bar Sunday night. The bar is about a mile away from where Dunn was killed in a car crash. Manager Jim O'Brien confirmed that Dunn was drinking there. ""He didn't seem to be intoxicated at the time he left,"" O'Brien said. ""Ryan was not a hardcore drinker, at least not when he was here."" O'Brien said Dunn was a regular customer and well known to his staff. ""He was a valuable person in our community and his death is a tragedy,"" O'Brien said. ""He will be missed."" Dunn teamed up with ""Jackass"" co-star Steve-O for an episode of the NBC game show ""Minute to Win It"" that aired on June 8. He also hosted ""Proving Ground,"" which premiered on the G4 channel on June 14.","Dunn's blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit, police say .

"(CNN) -- When I was doing my degree in computer science in Ghana's Valley View University 10 years ago, there just were seven girls in the class. After four years, only four graduated and out of that number, just two of us have stayed in technical roles. Today, my little sister's computer science class has at least 30% females and a smaller drop-off rate. All across Africa, the number of women entering the tech industry is improving thanks to the several nonprofit groups teaching girls how to code and the bigger availability of funds. As a result, more women are training to become tech professionals. Yet, a large number of them are having to leave their jobs after a few years as they can't break the glass ceiling in an industry that's still largely male-dominated. To address this, the Google Developer Group for women was created in Ghana less than two years ago. But soon the organizers came under attack from some men in the wider Google Developer Group community, with comments like ""why do you need a women only group?"" One guy's email even said, ""leave them alone, maybe they want to create apps about menstrual periods together."" Such attitudes are widespread. I run the Women in Tech group in Ghana and at one of our monthly events one young female computer scientist approached me and said: ""They keep telling me I cannot be really good at IT and also be a good wife and a mother."" Straight away, I introduced her to Estelle Akrofi, the Google Country Manager for Ghana, a mother of two and an all-round success; then I introduced her to Otema Yirenkyi, the country manager of Microsoft Ghana and mother of a beautiful five-year- old. Uphill task . The problems that African women in tech face are not very different from the ones female techies in many other parts of the world also come across. Yet, these challenges, coupled with some Africa-specific problems like power shortages and broadband inaccessibility, create an uphill task for women wanting to enter the industry and develop the high-level technical skills required in order to progress. Yet, I know there is progress, and the examples are many -- female tech entrepreneurs like Regina Agyare (Soronko Solutions), Anne Amuzu (Nandi Mobile), Rebecca Enonchong (Apps Tech), and myself are all running their own tech enterprises and succeeding at it. Read this: 5 reasons tech world needs more geek girls . Pan-African Women in Tech meet up . Up until now, no one had attempted to build a pan-African Women in Tech network that would allow us to compare our challenges, learn from each other and connect across borders to expand our influence. That lack is what motivated myself, Ethel Ella Mbawe from Zambia, Barbara Bingu from Uganda, Sam Beckbessinger from South Africa and Akaliza Keza Gara from Rwanda to organize in early August the first Women in Tech Africa meet up. More than 150 women signed up to the event that was supposed to happen online via Google hangout on August 2. Yet, bad Internet connection and technical challenges marred the event and made it difficult for the participants to communicate. But while we were trying to fix the technical challenges we noticed something interesting happening on the event's page: the women had already started introducing themselves and talking to each other. We saw how big the desire was to network and to share knowledge that we quickly decided to move the discussion to Twitter and start a live chat. The need to connect, to learn and to share was greater than any technical challenge. In the end, the Twitter conversation with the hashtag #WtechAfrica had the reach of 74,502 and 195,209 impressions on Twitter connecting female technologists all over Africa ably supported by one of our speakers Enyonam Kumahor. Here are some of the highlights of the discussion. Looking back into history and comparing it to today we know technology is not just a man's world. It is imperative that African women take advantage of this to provide a sustainable environment that would encourage and promote technology amongst women. So of course we will run the event again, this time with the lessons we learned and maybe strong sponsorships to help us succeed. Read this: 5 reasons tech world needs more geek girls .

"(CNN) -- France striker Thierry Henry has signed for the New York Red Bulls, the Major League Soccer club have announced. Henry joins from Barcelona, where he spent three seasons and won two Spanish league titles as well as the European Champions League. The 32-year-old is France's leading goalscorer having netted 51 times for his country and will be introduced to the press on July 15. His signing on a ""multi-year contract"" represents a major coup for the Red Bulls and for the MLS. Henry will become one of the most high-profile names in the league, alongside England international David Beckham. ""This marks an exciting new chapter in my career and life,"" Henry told the club's official website. ""It is an honor to play for the New York Red Bulls. ""I am fully aware of the team's history and my sole goal during my time here is to help win the club its first championship. ""Knowing Red Bull's significant commitment to soccer locally and internationally, I am confident that my teammates and I will succeed."" Henry was part of France's World Cup squad who were knocked out in the first round in South Africa and caused uproar among their fans by refusing to train two days before a match. He also caused controversy when his blatant handball led to a vital goal in France's winning qualification playoff with Ireland that secured their place at the tournament. Before joining Barcelona Henry spent eight seasons with English Premier League Arsenal, becoming their all-time record goalscorer and winning two league titles and three FA Cups. Ironically, Henry's first game for the Red Bulls could be against Arsenal's bitter north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on July 22. ""It is without question that Thierry Henry is one of the most successful and recognizable soccer players over the past 15 years,"" said Dietmar Beiersdorfer, Head of Red Bull Global Soccer. ""We are thrilled that Thierry has decided to come to New York to help the Red Bulls compete for championships this year and for years to come. His international pedigree is second to none and he is a proven winner."" Erik Soler, Red Bull New York General Manager and Sporting Director, added: ""Thierry is not only a world class player who will undoubtedly improve our squad, but he has shown most importantly throughout his career that he is a winner. ""He has made it clear to us that he is committed in the short and long term to help in our vision of making our organization the premium franchise in Major League Soccer.""","Barcelona striker Thierry Henry has signed for the New York Red Bulls .

"(CNN) -- On October 1, 1982, the first commercial compact disc, Billy Joel's ""52nd Street,"" was released in Japan. In the 30 years since, hundreds of billions of CDs have been sold, Joel has stopped recording pop music and the music industry has moved on to the next hot medium. When the first CD player was released that same day, it was described as a ""new digital record player, using laser beams"" by United Press International. Spun out of the far less successful Philips' laser disc technology (remember those?), the CD was a result of Philips and Sony combining forces. The compact disc was actually invented several years earlier. The first test CD was Richard Strauss's ""Eine Alpensinfonie,"" and the first CD actually pressed at a factory was ABBA's ""The Visitors,"" but that disc wasn't released commercially until later. Mass adoption didn't happen immediately -- CDs wouldn't overtake cassette tapes until the late 1980s. The first album to sell 1 million copies in the CD format and outsell its vinyl version was Dire Straits' ""Brothers in Arms,"" released in 1985. As with most new technologies, one reason for the slow spread of CDs was their steep price tags. The Sony CDP-101 player sold for the equivalent of $730 when it first hit Japanese shelves in 1982. Accounting for inflation, that's about $1,750 today. The audio CDs themselves were $15, which is $35 in 2012 dollars. Because getting a new player and replacing an entire music collection was costly, audio manufacturers were savvy enough to market the first CD players to classical music fans, who were more likely to care about sound quality and have extra disposable income. When they arrived, CDs were hailed for their pristine sound. But whether the audio quality of CDs is greater than vinyl remains a hotly debated topic among hi-fi enthusiasts. ""For most people who weren't audiophiles, the switch to CDs was a revolution. It took away all the audio noise,"" said Mark Katz, a music professor at the University of North Carolina and author of ""Capturing Sound: How Technology Has Changed Music."" Young listeners opting to stream, not own music . Some will still argue that records sound better than CDs, but that is only plausible when people take meticulous care of their albums, listening to them in scratchless, snap-crackle-and-pop-free condition. Most people don't consume music in a vacuum. Even today, the average music fan will listen to tunes on cheap earbuds in an environment filled with background noise, and is likely unable to be able to tell the difference between a CD and an MP3, says Katz. The compact disc changed technology, and went on to be used for data and video storage, evolving into re-writeable media and Blu-Ray DVDs. The shiny little platter also changed how people interacted with their music. ""Changing formats usually has greater impact on the way people listen, consume and disseminate the music, but it also does have an impact on the creative side,"" said Katz. The first compact discs could hold up to 74 minutes of music (the rumor was that the length of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony established that standard) or at least several songs more than a vinyl LP. This longer length allowed composers to write longer works without worrying about side breaks -- where listeners would have to flip over a record or cassette. Convenience was another huge change. The discs were small, just 4.5 inches in diameter, and could be carted around far more easily than records. Listening to music on a CD was easier -- there was no standing up to flip over the record or tape, less time spent searching for the song you wanted to hear right then. Some CD players even allowed you to program what songs played or didn't, and in what order. Three decades later, it may be surprising to some that CD sales, and Billy Joel's career, are still alive. Though their market share is plummeting, CDs still account for the majority of album sales in the U.S. In the first half of 2012, 61% of all albums sold were CDs, according to the Nielsen Company and Billboard. Even so, CDs are gradually being overtaken by digital files. At first, MP3s were burned from CDs onto computers, traded on peer-to-peer networks such as Napster and the Internet's back alleys. Then Apple released the iPod, and its iTunes store turned digital music files into a legitimate business. Now popular services like Spotify and Pandora let users stream music from anywhere, and Amazon and Apple are encouraging people to store their digital libraries in the cloud. Like CDs before them, this new format is changing both the creation and consumption of music. Musicians no longer have to wait until an album is finished to release tracks -- they can sell them one at a time. Length of a song isn't an issue, just file size. Listeners have more flexibility than ever, with unlimited mix-and-match options. And increasingly, they're opting to download single songs over albums. And in an age when computer users can conjure almost any song they want with a few taps or mouse clicks, music stores themselves are disappearing. Katz doesn't think CDs and physical music storage will ever vanish altogether. People like tangible things, and form meaningful relationships with objects they can hold and look at -- more so than strings of ones and zeros. That explains why vinyl sales are up, often among young hipster types who weren't even alive when vinyl was the dominant medium. ""There is the basic human fact of connection with physical objects, that won't change,"" said Katz. Compact discs are unlikely to evoke the nostalgia many people feel for vinyl records, with their spiraling black groove and sometimes trippy cover art. And to people born in this century, they're already becoming a retro curiosity. Streaming debate strikes chord with music fans . But a generation of music fans grew up on them -- Nirvana, Public Enemy, Billy Joel and all.","On October 1, 1982, Billy Joel's ""52nd Street"" was released commercially on CD .

"(CNN) -- Pakistani troops launched a ground offensive against militants in the capital of the country's North Waziristan area Monday, starting a new phase of a 16-day fight that has seen more than 450,000 people flee the area. Troops killed at least 15 militants as the army raided homes in the area's capital, Miranshah, the country's military said. This is the first major ground offensive in Miranshah since Pakistan began what was primarily an airstrike campaign against anti-government fighters in North Waziristan and other restive parts of Pakistan's loosely governed tribal areas. The offensive, which started on June 15, is meant to ""finish off"" militants in the area near the Afghanistan border ""once and for all,"" Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told CNN this month. The Pakistani Taliban are among the targets. The tribal areas in northwestern Pakistan are a base for anti-government militants, including those with the Islamist Haqqani movement. More than 376 militants have been killed and 61 suspected militant hideouts have been destroyed in the campaign, the army said. Three Pakistani troops were injured in Monday's raids in Miranshah, the army said. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes to camps in Pakistan's nearby Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province since the campaign began, the country's National Disaster Management Authority said. About 466,000 people, including 197,013 children, have registered at checkpoints, the agency said. Rations, including food and cooking oil, are being given to the civilians at the camps, the army said.

"(CNN) -- Pakistan on Sunday launched a military operation in a restive province near the border with Afghanistan in an attempt to ""finish off"" militants in the area ""once and for all,"" Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told CNN. Asif said the operation, which included airstrikes early Sunday, was the government's second option, but negotiations with the Pakistani Taliban failed. On Monday, the Pakistani Taliban issued a statement calling on all foreign-run businesses, international airline companies and multinational companies to ""wrap up their affairs (and) leave Pakistan immediately."" The statement was issued by spokesman Shahidullah Shahid in response to the military's operation. Shahid said the Pakistani Taliban will meet any military operation with an equally damaging response and that ""the government will yearn for talks and peace but will realize that it is now too late."" Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif defended the operation to members of parliament on Monday, saying that the government had tried patiently to pursue peace talks. ""On one hand we were pursuing dialogue, and on the other we were being targeted. We were pursuing talks, but from Islamabad courts to Karachi airport we were attacked."" Sharif vowed that the operation would continue until terrorism is eliminated from Pakistan. Six soldiers were killed and three were injured Monday in an IED explosion, according to Pakistan's military. Two soldiers died in an exchange of fire that killed seven terrorists who were trying to flee, the Defense Ministry said. Earlier the military released a statement that said 50 suspected terrorists were killed in the airstrikes. The air raids were based on intelligence about the presence of foreign and local militants who were linked to last week's deadly attack on the Karachi airport, the military said. Asif said the Karachi airport attack was the ""straw that broke the camel's back."" Here's a look at what you need to know about Pakistan . Pakistani Taliban sources said jets dropped five bombs on the Degan area of North Waziristan. The target was a meeting of Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan members, the militant group said, but added that the number of casualties was unclear. ""In this operation we will not differentiate between foreign and local militants,"" Asif said. ""We are determined to finish them off, once and for all."" Most of the fatalities in the strikes were Uzbek fighters, the military said. The raid took place in Degan and Datta Khel. Asif said the military hopes to conclude the offensive -- called Zarb-e-Azb in Urdu, which translates to ""Strike of the Prophet's Sword"" -- by the beginning of Ramadan on June 28. But it may take two or three months, he said, until ""our land ... is free of this menace."" He said it is a Pakistani-only operation and the United States hasn't been asked to assist with drone strikes. Northwestern Pakistan is home to loosely governed tribal areas. It's also a base for foreign fighters and a refuge for members of the Islamist militant Haqqani movement. Last week, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan claimed it carried out the airport attack, which resulted in an hours-long siege and left dozens dead, including the assailants. The militants said the attack was carried out with the Pakistani Taliban. There were reports that travelers were congregating in hotels and restaurants in towns like Bannu after being stranded due to a curfew that began Friday. Asif said the government will help out residents. ""We are at war now. There will be inevitable fallouts,"" he said. ""If there is blowback, we are ready and prepared to assist people who have had to flee from their homes."" CNN's Zahir Shah Shirazi and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","NEW: Pakistan's Prime Minister justifies operations, saying talks failed .

"(CNN) -- There is not a single day I don't think about them. Exactly two months ago, over 200 schoolgirls were abducted in Chibok, Northern Nigeria. Today, they are still missing. And I feel as outraged as many of you do. As the world hopes for their safe return, there is another story. What doesn't make the headlines is the fact that many children around the world have never had a chance to go to school. In West and Central Africa, almost 1 out of 5 school-age children will never enter a classroom, according to a new report by UNICEF and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Globally, more than 57 million primary school-age children do not attend classes. Over half of them live in sub-Saharan Africa. What keeps so many children excluded from school across the continent? What prevents so many children from seeing a classroom, given that ""free education"" became a reality in various countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including my home country, Benin? One report finds that girls from poor families living in rural areas have significantly less opportunities to go to school. In addition, conflicts and natural disasters can cause extensive damages and disrupt schooling -- sometimes for weeks, sometimes for years. While the abolishment of school fees has led to a sharp increase in the number of children enrolled in schools, in many countries ""free education"" is never entirely free. Supplies, books and other indirect costs can easily make access to school unaffordable. Getting out-of-school children into school is more than just building more classrooms and deploying more teachers. In order to reduce the number of children excluded from the education system, African governments must commit to the idea of bringing girls back to school. Even when all the barriers to access are lifted, the quality of the learning taking place in the classroom remains an issue. Those who enter school often drop out without acquiring adequate skills and never complete primary or lower secondary school. High repetition rates lead to large proportions of adolescents who are held back in education systems that are inappropriate for their age. Everyone wins when children -- and especially girls -- have access to education. An educated girl is likely to increase her personal earning potential and prepare herself for a productive and fulfilling life, as well as reduce poverty in the whole community. Investing in girls' education also helps delay early marriage and parenthood. Our booming economies in Africa need more female engineers, teachers and doctors to prosper and sustain growth. Throughout Africa, I visited a lot of schools where UNICEF and its partners are working to get every child, especially girls and other marginalized groups, into classrooms. I saw firsthand how simple programs, such as scholarships, mentoring, a second chance to education and the provision of sanitary pads, can make a difference in the lives of girls. As I watched African schoolgirls on their way to school, I wondered where I would be today if I hadn't had the opportunity to access education when I was a child. Would I be able to write this piece if my parents hadn't made all the needed sacrifice to let me learn, grow and strive? Probably not. Most of us take access to school for granted. I don't. For many children in Africa, it's still a luxury, perhaps the most indispensable yet reachable luxury for Nigeria and the whole continent.","Angelique Kidjo: Over 200 schoolgirls abducted in Nigeria are still missing .

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton was confronted by immigration reform activists in Iowa over the weekend. The activists accused President Obama of breaking promises to immigrants and wanted to know what Clinton would do about the issue. She told them to ""elect more Democrats."" The former secretary of state and likely future presidential candidate was signing autographs and T-shirts and participating in selfies in Iowa on Sunday when a DREAMer tried to turn the conversation to immigration and deportations. Monica Reyes announced herself as a DREAMer, an undocumented immigrant brought to the U.S. by parents. Clinton, wearing black sunglasses, responded, ""Yay."" ""I was wondering what you feel about Obama's delay on immigration,"" Reyes asked Clinton in an in an exchange caught on video by immigration reform activists. While Clinton continued down the line of people behind metal barriers, she responded, ""I think we have to keep working -- can't stop ever working."" President Barack Obama recently announced that he was postponing his announcement to address broken immigration policy until after the elections. The decision infuriated immigration advocates, who were already disappointed in the record number of deportations during Obama's tenure. Cesar Vargas, a member of the DRM Coalition standing next to Reyes, pointedly followed up. ""The President has broken his promise to the Latino community, and we wanted to know if you stand by the President's delay on immigration,"" he said. Clinton kept moving but said, ""You know, I think we have to elect more Democrats."" Hillary Clinton's return to Iowa: a fresh start or deja vu? This was the first time Clinton had been to Iowa as a politician since she lost the caucuses there in 2008 to then-Sen. Barack Obama. At Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry in Indianola on Monday, her speech, filled with foreshadowing innuendos, added to the speculation that Clinton is seriously plotting a second presidential run. Vargas and fellow DREAMers also confronted Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described socialist who is toying with a presidential run, in Iowa over the weekend. On Twitter, Vargas wrote that Sanders hit a ""home run"" while Clinton struck out. But the activists' attendance at the Clinton and Sanders events signals that the immigrant community and immigration advocates are going to put political pressure on candidates contemplating a presidential run. ""The message we want to make clear to them is they should not take our community for granted,"" Cristina Jimenez, co-founder of United We Dream, told CNN. Latinos, who are not the only community affected by deportations but recently has been the largest, tend to vote for Democrats. They backed Obama overwhelmingly -- by more than 70% -- in the 2008 and 2012 elections. ""We ask Republicans the question 'why do they want to deport us,' and we're going to do the same thing with Democrats,"" Jimenez told CNN. ""Both parties have really failed our community."" DREAMers interrupted one of Sen. Marco Rubio's events in South Carolina, also a key presidential nominating state, last month. And earlier in August, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul abruptly left a lunch table in Iowa when Vargas and fellow DREAMers confronted colleague and immigration hard-liner Rep. Steve King.","Hillary Clinton was confronted by DREAMers in Iowa about Obama's immigration delay .

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department on Friday invoked the government's ""state secrets privilege"" to intervene in a private legal dispute between the owner of a Greek shipping company and a U.S. nonprofit that advocates against Iran's nuclear program. In a court filing in New York, government lawyers asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by Victor Restis against the group United Against Nuclear Iran. Restis claims he was defamed in a UANI campaign that alleged his company had ties to the Iranian government companies that are involved in Iran's nuclear program. The government filing said an unnamed U.S. agency had determined the case risked revealing government secrets. Restis' lawyers had sought to compel legal discovery -- the turning over of documents and other information -- from the group, its executives, and from Wall Street investor Thomas Kaplan, who Restis' lawyers claim is a funder of UANI. UANI lawyers had sought to obtain a deposition of Restis to question him about alleged Iran ties. Friday's government filing provided no detail of how UANI, Restis, or any others involved could have come to possess U.S. national security secrets. It said that ""disclosure of the information at issue reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security."" Kaplan's lawyers have claimed he has no information relevant to the case. UANI has defended its free speech rights to campaign on the Iran issue. Justice Department lawyers had previously attended hearings in the case and signaled the possibility the government may intervene, citing possible ""law enforcement"" secrets. The filing Friday goes beyond that, and by simply asserting ""state secrets,"" the government limits what can be reviewed in the case. Government lawyers also filed a classified court filing that ostensibly provided more information to the judge. Before becoming president, Barack Obama had criticized the Bush administration for using the state secrets privilege and vowed more transparency. The Obama administration has used the privilege in several cases.

"(CNN) -- Amid the women in lacy wedding veils and the men in spiffy suits at the county clerk's office was Peter Brownstein. He'd replaced the blue neckerchief of his Scoutmaster's uniform with one in the colors of the rainbow, the colors of gay pride. He carried boxes of hot pepperoni and cheese pizzas in his arms. And by his side, he had his son Michael, a 14-year-old Eagle Scout. Brownstein, 52, had gone down to the Salt Lake City office to bear witness to a marriage. What he found Monday morning was a line that snaked along halls on two floors of the building. Gay couples had rushed in to tie the knot after a district judge struck down Utah's ban on same-sex marriage. Mayor Ralph Becker called it a ""thrilling pandemonium."" Many had been waiting for hours. Some brought along children in strollers. They were all hungry. As were the employees of the clerk's office, who skipped lunch to process the crush of marriage certificate applications. Brownstein went down to the Little Caesar's and picked up 10 pizzas. He and Michael handed out slices to the employees and the couples waiting to wed. Their generosity was appreciated. Their courage, noticed. That they performed this task dressed in their Scout uniforms immediately drew attention. Cell-phone photos went off to Twitter and Facebook. Comments like this got posted on blogs: . ""Utah. Boy scouts. Delivering pizzas. To support. Gay marriage. The. End."" Joanna Brooks wrote those words in the online Religion Dispatches. Yes, this was conservative Utah, the epicenter of Mormonism. Yes, Brownstein was affiliated with the Scouts, an organization that has been mired in controversy over its policies on homosexuality and earlier this year voted to allow openly gay youths to join. The vote caused an uproar among conservative and some religious organizations that argued the change would dilute the Scout message of morality. Brownstein is no stranger to any of that controversy. As leader of Boy Scout Troop 351, he's long advocated for the Scouts to accept all boys and men into the organization. He was reprimanded last June for participating in full uniform in the Utah pride parade in Salt Lake City. ""We are very disappointed that you used Scouting to advance the gay agenda,"" wrote Bry Davis, council president, and Rick Barnes, Scout executive. The United Jewish Federation of Utah, the sponsor of Troop 351, suspended all its activities in September. Executive Director Alex Shapiro said the federation does not discriminate against any groups. He said the troop was shut down because families of the Scouts felt Brownstein's focus had shifted away from their children. ""It is true that Troop 351 is no longer active, however, that was a decision that was made solely by the Scout families and did not involve the federation,"" Shapiro said. Brownstein was disappointed. He didn't see his actions as promoting any agenda or violating any Boy Scout rules. He saw the parade as a celebration of cultural diversity. He held steadfast to his belief that Scouting was and still is the finest youth development program. He loved how his son learned self-sufficiency and honed leadership skills. When he took his troop to summer camp last year, Brownstein chose not to participate in the food program. Instead, he and the boys cooked on an open fire. Meat stews were popular. So were the brown-and-serve rolls cooked in a cast iron Dutch oven. And both father and son admired the ideals of service instilled by the Scouts. It was in that vein that they decided to hand out pizza on Monday. ""I see it as simply providing service,"" Michael said. His father added this: ""I would say that it's meant to show what true Scouting values are -- of thinking of others and helping others and not being selective about who you are helping."" In this season of Hanukkah and Christmas, Brownstein, who is Jewish, also believes what he did Monday was in line with his religious beliefs. ""I still celebrated Hanukkah, not Christmas. But this seems in the spirit of Christmas,"" he said of his pizza delivery. Is he glad he did it? ""Totally."" Would he do it again? ""In a heartbeat."" Brownstein feels good about what he did, even though Troop 351 is still without a sponsor and Monday's actions may not necessarily help him out. Well, maybe he does have one regret. Next time, he'll get more pizza so there'll be a slice left for him.","Peter Brownstein delivered pizza to same-sex couples waiting to be married .

"(CNN) -- Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel are getting their group back together this spring for a reunion tour of Asia and Australia, according to a source close to the group. Art Garfunkel and Paul Simon, here performing at a 2007 gala, are planning to tour this summer. Reunion plans apparently began after Simon and Garfunkel played three songs together during Simon's two-night gig at New York's Beacon Theatre in February. Tour rehearsals begin in New York in May and the tour will launch in New Zealand around the first week of June, according to the source. Shows in Australia and possibly Japan will follow, the source said. Simon's manager, Jeff Kramer, has asked the group's musicians to clear their calendars -- which means canceling other shows -- from late May through June, the source said. Kramer, in a statement to Rolling Stone magazine after the February show, hinted that a tour was in the works. No official announcement has been made and Simon's publicist has not responded to CNN requests for comment. ""Yes there have been conversations taking place, but nothing has been confirmed,"" Kramer told Rolling Stone. Simon and Garfunkel last reunited for their ""Old Friends"" tour in 2003 and 2004, which Rolling Stone estimated earned $123 million. The duo, friends since childhood, is famous for breaking up and making up about every dozen years.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Explosions and anti-aircraft fire thundered in the skies above Tripoli early Sunday, but it was not clear whether they resulted from another round of cruise missile attacks by allies determined to stop Moammar Gadhafi's offensive against Libyan opposition forces. CNN's Nic Robertson witnessed the development a few hours after nearly 1,000 people gathered at Gadhafi's palace in the capital. The crowd chanted, waved flags and shot off fireworks in support of the government. A defiant Gadhafi said Libya will fight back against undeserved ""naked aggression."" His military claimed nearly 50 people, including, women, children and clerics, were killed in Saturday evening's attacks. There was no independent confirmation of that statement. American, French and British military forces, convinced that Gadhafi was not adhering to a United Nations-mandated cease-fire, hammered Libyan military positions with missiles and fighter jets in the first phase of an operation that will include enforcement of a no-fly zone. An eyewitness in Tripoli reported seeing signs of gunfire rising Sunday morning from the direction of nearby Mitiga Airport. The anti-Gadhafi activist said she heard ""continuous gunshots"" and at least two loud explosions. It was not clear if the airport was also being used as a military installation. The eyewitness, who was not identified for security reasons, said she did not hear the sound of flying aircraft. More than 110 Tomahawk missiles fired from American and British ships and submarines hit about 20 Libyan air and missile defense targets in western portions of the country, U.S. Vice Adm. William Gortney said at a Pentagon briefing. The U.S. will conduct a damage assessment of the sites, which include SA-5 missiles and communications facilities. A senior U.S. military official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said the cruise missiles, which fly close to the ground or sea at about 550 miles per hour, landed near Misrata and Tripoli. The salvo, in an operation dubbed ""Odyssey Dawn,"" was meant ""to deny the Libyan regime from using force against its own people,"" said Gortney. U.S. Navy photos showed flashes of light and smoke funnels as missiles soared from a destroyer into the night sky. Earlier, French fighter jets deployed over Libya fired at a military vehicle Saturday, the first strike against Gadhafi's military forces, which earlier attacked the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. Prime Minister David Cameron said late Saturday that British forces also are in action over Libya. ""What we are doing is necessary, it is legal and it is right,"" he said. ""I believe we should not stand aside while this dictator murders his own people."" British Defense Secretary Liam Fox said the Royal Air Force deployed Tornado GR4 fast jets, which flew 3,000 miles from the United Kingdom and back, ""making this the longest-range bombing mission conducted by the RAF since the (1982) Falklands conflict."" While there were no U.S. warplanes flying over Libya late Saturday, the coalition was softening Libyan positions before enforcing a no-fly zone, Gortney said. The Libyan military, in a statement broadcast on state TV, said, ""An enemy attacked the state on March 19th with rockets ... Those enemies killed 48 martyrs -- mostly women, children, and religious clerics. They left more than 150 injured. The majority of these attacks were on public areas, hospitals and schools. They frightened the children and women near those areas that were subject to this aggression."" Gadhafi, speaking early Sunday on Libyan state TV, said the U.N. charter provides for Libya's right to defend itself in a ""war zone."" Weapons depots will be opened, he said. ""All you people of the Islamic nations and Africa, and Latin America and Asia, stand with the Libyan people in its fight against this aggression,"" Gadhafi said. Air attacks on several locations in Tripoli and Misrata have caused ""real harm"" to civilians, a Libyan government spokesman said. An eyewitness in Misrata said Gadhafi's forces are targeting fuel and power stations in an effort to make citizens believe the damage is being done by coalition forces. The eyewitness, who was not identified for security reasons, said people celebrated allied airstrikes on loyalist positions in the city. CNN could not verify the account. Shortly after the first missile attacks, U.S. President Barack Obama informed the American people of the efforts by a ""broad coalition."" ""The use of force is not our first choice,"" the president said from Brasilia, Brazil. ""It is not a choice I make lightly. But we cannot stand idly by when a tyrant tells his own people that there will be no mercy."" Obama is planning for the U.S. portion of the military action in Libya to only last for a few days, according to a senior administration official, who was not authorized to speak about sensitive military matters. ""After that we'll take more of a supporting role,"" the senior official said. Obama authorized U.S. military force from Brazil on what happened to be the eighth anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq. Coalition partners say Gadhafi has failed to adhere to a United Nations resolution that imposed the no-fly zone and ordered him to stop attacks on civilians. ""He's clearly been on the offensive,"" the senior U.S. military official said of Gadhafi. ""He said that he was going to do a cease-fire and he continued to move his forces into Benghazi."" Earlier Saturday, Gadhafi issued defiant messages to international powers. ""I have all the Libyan people with me and I'm prepared to die. And they are prepared to die for me. Men, women and even children,"" Gadhafi said in a letter addressed to Obama and read to reporters by a government spokesman in Tripoli. Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Gortney used the term ""unique capabilities"" to describe the U.S. part of the effort. Officials have said American military forces are meant to augment Arab, European and other Western troops. In the next few days, U.S. military officials expect to hand over control to a coalition commander. Canada and Italy also are part of the coalition. ""Our air force will oppose any aggression by Colonel Gadhafi against the population of Benghazi,"" said French President Nicolas Sarkozy, speaking after a top-level meeting in Paris over the Libyan crisis. The international meeting -- which included Western and Arab partners -- focused on how to take on a Libyan government bent on destroying the fledgling opposition movement under the U.N. resolution authorizing force to protect civilians against the Gadhafi government. Rebel forces in Benghazi used a captured army tank as a victory symbol, CNN's Arwa Damon reported. Earlier Saturday, incoming artillery rounds landed inside Benghazi, and pro-Gadhafi tanks rolled into the town firing rounds, witnesses said. A flaming fighter jet plummeted from the sky, nose-diving to the ground. Khaled el-Sayeh, the opposition military spokesman, said the plane was an old MiG-23 that belonged to the rebels. As night fell over Benghazi on Saturday, the city became quiet and calm. While plumes of smoke could be spotted, the pro-Gadhafi tanks seen earlier were not in sight. El-Sayeh told CNN that ""tens"" had been killed in Benghazi on Saturday. He said Gadhafi forces had withdrawn from the city and that they were positioned 50 kilometers (31 miles) outside Benghazi. CNN could not independently verify those details. Gadhafi -- in a separate letter addressed to Sarkozy, Cameron and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- called the U.N. moves ""invalid"" because the resolution does not permit intervention in the internal affairs of other countries. Violence has raged in Libya following protests calling for democracy and freedom and demanding an end to Gadhafi's almost 42-year-long rule. It's a conflict spurred by anti-government protest and resulting regime violence against civilians -- which the U.N. resolution cites as ""outrageous"" and Sarkozy calls ""murderous madness.""

"Big Bear Lake, California (CNN) -- The ex-cop suspected in the killings of an officer and two others remained at large Friday as darkness fell over a mountain forest and police suspended their manhunt until Saturday morning. ""Once it gets dark out there and the snow keeps falling and they have no air support, I don't know how effective they would be in that situation,"" spokeswoman Cindy Bachman of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said. Throughout Friday, more than 100 officers searched through fresh snow for clues to the whereabouts of Christopher Jordan Dorner, 33, a fired Los Angeles Police Department officer and former Navy lieutenant suspected in the three killings. Dorner allegedly wrote a manifesto declaring a war of revenge on police, authorities said. By Friday night, police were expected to have completed a search of vacant cabins in the snowpacked forest of the San Bernardino Mountains near the resort town of Big Bear Lake, Bachman said. Police on Thursday searched 400 homes in the Big Bear Lake area and were completing searches of 200 more on Friday, she said. Overnight patrols in the town were to be beefed up with 12 extra two-officer teams, she said. ""The search is continuing,"" Bachman said. ""First of all, they have to rest. They have been going at this for two days."" Police teams were dressed in snow gear, holding the trigger guards on their assault-style rifles while scouring eight square miles near Big Bear Lake, a popular skiing area two hours east of Los Angeles. The mountains were the focus of Friday's search effort because police had found Dorner's burned-out pickup truck a day earlier near the resort community. The truck had a broken axle, which would have prevented the vehicle from moving, and footprints appear to show that Dorner doubled back into the community, said a source with knowledge of the investigation. It was unclear where Dorner may have gone from there or by what means, the source said. But Bachman told reporters Friday: ""The possibility exists that he is here, somewhere in the forest, so we're going to keep looking...until we determine that he's not here."" Guns found in the truck were also burned, but authorities believe Dorner may have as many as 30 guns with him, the source said. Dorner was in the Navy and is trained in counterinsurgency and intelligence, the source said. Two inches of snow Friday coated the mountaintop pine trees and roads around Big Bear Lake, leading motorists to use tire chains. Up to six more inches were expected. But the snow was regarded as a godsend because tracking a man on the run would be easier, authorities said. Despite the intense search, authorities allowed nearby ski resorts to remain open Friday because they don't believe Dorner is in Big Bear Lake. At one point, a smiling snowboarder whizzed by police and media, seemingly oblivious to an ongoing news conference and the seriousness of the manhunt. Jay Obernolte, mayor of Big Bear Lake community, described Friday as having ""a beautiful winter morning."" Residents weren't fearful, he said, adding that ""many of the people here are armed."" ""Is there panic in our community?"" Obernolte asked reporters rhetorically. ""No, there is no panic. We're a hearty people in the San Bernardino Mountains."" San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said the snowfall slowed some searching done by foot, but police pushed onward. ""The snow is great for tracking folks, as well as looking at each individual cabin to see if there's any sign of forced entry,"" McMahon said. ""We're going to continue searching until we either discover he left the mountain or we find him,"" he added. ""It's extremely dangerous."" Related: Manhunt leaves LAPD officers 'tense' The county jail in downtown Los Angeles was in lockdown Friday as a precaution after a civilian female employee of the Twin Towers Correctional Facility spotted someone fitting Dorner's description, said Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore. U.S. Navy installations throughout California and Nevada were ""maintaining a heightened security posture,"" a U.S. military official told CNN. ""Security personnel are on the lookout"" for Dorner, the official said. The measure was ordered overnight by Rear Adm. Dixon Smith, commander of the Navy's southwest region. The official declined to discuss security procedures, but said the move was made after it became clear that Dorner earlier this week gained access to the Naval Base at Point Loma and stayed in a motel there. Two sailors reported that he approached them Wednesday and spoke with them for about 10 minutes. The conversation took place at a coastal ""riverine"" unit in San Diego where Dorner served in 2006. As a Navy reservist, Dorner held security jobs with that unit. The Navy is not certain whether Dorner still possesses any military identification he might try to use to enter a facility. The official said an investigation is under way to determine what military identification he might have. Dorner underwent flight training in 2009 at Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada before serving in San Diego. In La Palma, California, about 22 miles southeast of Los Angeles, police searched Friday the home of Dorner's mother, where she and a daughter were cooperating with investigators, said Lt. Bill Whalen of the Irvine Police Department. Related: Dorner's grudge dates back to 2007 . The 270-pound former Navy lieutenant promised to bring ""unconventional and asymmetrical warfare"" to police officers and their families, calling it the ""last resort"" to clear his name and retaliate at a department that he says mistreated him. Dorner is wanted in the killings on Sunday of two people in Irvine and in the shooting of three Los Angeles-area police officers Thursday, one of whom died. One of the victims of the Irvine killings, Monica Quan, was the daughter of the retired police officer who represented Dorner in his efforts to get his job back, police said. ""My opinion of the suspect is unprintable,"" Riverside police Chief Sergio Diaz said, hours after one of his officers was killed. ""The manifesto, I think, speaks for itself (as) evidence of a depraved and abandoned mind and heart."" Related: Timeline of events . Here's what is known so far: . -- Dorner, who worked as an LAPD officer from 2005 to 2008, is accused of killing Quan and her fiance Sunday in Irvine, then shooting two Riverside police officers and an LAPD officer Thursday. Police say he unleashed numerous rounds at the Riverside officers, riddling their car with bullets and killing a 34-year-old officer. The second officer in the car was seriously wounded, and the LAPD officer suffered only minor injuries, police said. -- In a lengthy letter provided by police, Dorner said he had been unfairly fired by the LAPD after reporting another officer for police brutality. He decried what he called a continuing culture of racism and violence within the department, and called attacks on police and their families ""a necessary evil that I do not enjoy but must partake and complete for substantial change to occur within the LAPD and reclaim my name."" -- Leads have taken police from Los Angeles to San Diego to Las Vegas to Big Bear Lake, where police found the charred carcass of Dorner's gray pickup. Police had found no trace of him Friday, the San Bernadino County sheriff said. Trackers lost footprints believed to be Dorner's in a wooded area near the truck. -- The LAPD and other agencies have gone to extremes to protect officers. Forty teams of officers were guarding people named as targets in Dorner's letter. On Thursday, one of the teams shot at a pickup that resembled Dorner's but turned out to be a Los Angeles Times newspaper delivery vehicle. -- Despite Dorner's statement in the letter that ""when the truth comes out, the killing stops,"" Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck said authorities don't plan to apologize to Dorner or attempt to clear his name. Dorner's firing, Beck said Thursday, had already been ""thoroughly reviewed."" -- In Nevada on Thursday, FBI agents searched Dorner's Las Vegas home. The search forced some of Dorner's neighbors out of their homes for several hours, CNN affiliate KLAS reported. ""It's too close to home. It's kind of scary,"" neighbor Dan Gomez told KLAS. A message to the media . In addition to posting his manifesto online, Dorner mailed a parcel to AC360 Anchor Anderson Cooper's office at CNN in New York. The package arrived on February 1 and was opened by Cooper's assistant. Inside was a hand-labeled DVD, accompanied by a yellow Post-it note reading, in part, ""I never lied"" -- apparently in reference to his 2008 dismissal from the LAPD. The package also contained a coin wrapped in duct tape. The tape bears the handwritten inscription: ""Thanks, but no thanks, Will Bratton."" It also had letters that may be read as ""IMOA,"" which could be a commonly used Internet abbreviation for ""Imagine a More Open America,"" or possibly ""1 MOA,"" which means one minute of angle, perhaps implying Dorner was accurate with a firearm. The coin is a souvenir medallion from former LAPD Chief William Bratton, of a type often given out as keepsakes. This one, though, was shot through with bullet holes: three bullet holes to the center and one that nicked off the top. The editorial staff of AC360 and CNN management were made aware of the package Thursday. Upon learning of its existence, they alerted Bratton and law enforcement. Bratton headed the LAPD at the time Dorner was dismissed.

"(CNN) -- Joe Paterno, the Penn State football coach who lost his job amid allegations of child sex abuse against his former defensive coordinator, has a treatable form of lung cancer, his son said Friday. The family learned of the diagnosis after Paterno's follow-up visit last weekend for a bronchial illness, Scott Paterno said. ""He is currently undergoing treatment, and his doctors are optimistic that he will make a full recovery,"" Scott Paterno said in a statement. ""As everyone can appreciate, this is a deeply personal matter for my parents, and we simply ask that his privacy be respected as he proceeds with treatment."" Paterno, 84, the all-time winningest football coach in Division I history, was fired last week amid the outcry over the handling of the abuse claims. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen said. ""It is such a difficult, difficult cancer to beat,"" she said. ""Often, it is found pretty late."" Cohen said that catching the disease early is crucial to improving chances for survival. White men who discover their lung cancer early have a 50-50 chance of being alive five years later. If they catch it late, they have a 4% chance of being alive five years later, Cohen said. If Paterno is a candidate for surgery, Cohen told ""The Situation Room,"" he may lose at least 20% of his lungs. Paterno, who served 46 years as head coach in State College, was known to generations of football fans simply as JoePa. National outrage percolated over Paterno's reaction to a graduate assistant's 2002 report that he had seen former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky performing anal sex on a young boy in the shower room of the football complex. Paterno said that he'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report about sex abuse allegations but that he nevertheless passed the allegations on to his boss. He said he had done ""what I was supposed to do."" In a later statement, he said ""with the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more."" It was years before law enforcement learned about the allegation. Friday's announcement coincides with news of an NCAA investigation at Penn State. ""This unprecedented situation demands the NCAA evaluate the university's accountability"" and application of NCAA bylaws, NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a letter to the school. CNN contributor Sara Ganim reported from Pennsylvania.","NEW: Treatment options include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy .

"(CNN) -- ""I think it's 50-50."" That was former President George W. Bush's take on the likelihood of his brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, running for president in 2016. ""I know that he's wrestling with the decision,"" Bush said in an interview Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""I'd give it a toss-up."" Bush has not been shy about publicly encouraging his younger brother to run for president in 2016. Last month, he told Fox News that he thinks his brother ""wants to be president."" Bush 43 admitted that he does ""occasionally fuel speculation"" about his brother's political ambitions, but said he does so because he thinks his brother is the man for the job. ""He'd be a great president,"" Bush said. ""And the country could use an optimistic view like his."" ""I know this about Jeb: He is not afraid to succeed. In other words, I think he knows he could do the job. And nor is he afraid to fail."" Since exiting politics in 2008, George W. Bush has retreated to a quieter life in Texas, spending much of his time painting and doing charitable work. But should his brother decide to take the leap, Bush says he would be ready to help out in any way he can. ""I'll do whatever he wants,"" Bush said. ""I will be one of his strongest backers. If he wants me out there publicly, I'll be out there publicly. If he wants me behind the scenes, I'll be behind the scenes. ... I'm all in for him. "" But for now, he's just waiting for his brother to weigh out the pros and cons himself. ""He's not here knocking on my door, you know, agonizing about the decision,"" Bush said. ""He knows exactly ... the ramifications on family, for example. He's seen his dad and his brother go through the presidency."" Earlier this year, Jeb Bush stressed the importance of his family in the process of considering a bid, telling CNN affiliate WFOR, ""The decision will be based on, 'Can I do it joyfully?' ... And is it right for my family?"" But according to his older brother, Jeb shouldn't be so worried about that second part. Asked if it's worth it to put a family through a presidential run, George W. Bush told CBS on Sunday, ""Yeah, it is."" Perhaps he says that because the majority of Jeb Bush's immediate family seems to be on board with the decision. Two weeks ago, Jeb's son George P. Bush, who has since been elected land commissioner of Texas, told ABC that his father is ""more than likely"" eyeing a 2016 run. In April, Jeb Bush's younger brother Neil said their father, former president George H. W. Bush, also endorsed the idea. Thus far, the only member of the Bush clan to publicly reject the idea of Jeb Bush running for president has been his mother, Barbara Bush, who told PBS in January, ""I hope he won't.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Mayor Vincent Gray knew in January 2012 that members of his staff had not properly reported funds raised for his 2010 campaign, according to a source close to a federal investigation into his campaign funding. When Jeanne Clarke Harris, a public relations consultant, told Gray in a meeting that she had not reported all the expenditures from the campaign, the mayor instructed her to report them right away, the source said. Harris pleaded guilty this week to helping orchestrate a secret campaign on Gray's behalf. The allegations have led three of Gray's former colleagues on the Washington council -- David A. Catania, Mary M. Cheh and Muriel Bowser -- to call for his resignation, while also writing the next chapter in what has been a long history of political scandal coming from Washington's mayoral office. Three of the last four occupants of the office have been stung by ethics questions ranging from crack cocaine use and possession to campaign finance violations. ""Whether or not he knew of the massive election fraud that was taking place in his name, he is responsible for it,"" Cheh said in a statement about Gray. She said the scandal ""has caused incalculable harm to the district."" On Wednesday in his first public statements since Harris' revelations, Gray said, ""This is not the campaign that we intended to run."" Gray went on to acknowledge that his 2010 campaign had ""issues."" But on Thursday, Gray said he had no plans to resign. Asked about the three council members who are calling for him to resign, Gray said there are nine other members who have not called for his resignation. And he said he was disappointed in Cheh's call for him to step down. ""She's a constitutional lawyer and I think people you know, until somebody has proven somebody there is something, there's no reason to raise those kind of issues,"" he said. Former senior adviser Mo Elleithee verified the issues, saying there were basically two campaigns. ""There were those people that were working legitimately, following the rules, playing by the rules trying to get his message out,"" said Elleithee. ""And then there were these people doing this thing on the side. And most of us on the legitimate campaign didn't see it. They hid it very well."" Elleithee said he didn't believe Gray should step down over the finance infractions, as long as he didn't do anything directly wrong. Elleithee did acknowledged that ""every candidate is ultimately responsible for his own campaign."" Campaigns and politicians with ""issues"" are par for the course in Washington's local government. The litany of D.C. politicians who became mired in political scandal and turmoil -- some of whom were forced to resign for wrongdoing -- is not a lonely group. The most well known of the scandalized district politicians is Marion Barry, a four-term Washington mayor and current council member for Ward 8. Barry was first elected in 1979 and was the dominant political force in the district until 1990, when he was arrested and charged with crack cocaine use and possession. Barry was caught in a sting operation while he and his former girlfriend, Rasheeda Moore, were using crack in a room at the Vista Hotel. After agents stormed the room and arrested Barry -- all of which was caught on camera -- the mayor became enraged and yelled, ""Bitch set me up."" The sting and arrest became a stain on the district and, in many ways, made the mayor a laughingstock. Barry was convicted of drug possession and served six months in federal prison. Barry wasn't done getting in trouble. In 2005, he pleaded guilty to failing to file his tax returns from 1999 through 2004. For that plea, the then-D.C. council member received three years' probation. D.C. political scandal is not contained to Barry. In 2009, four Washington council committees voted to investigate then-Mayor Adrian Fenty after city contracts were awarded to a company owned by Omar Karim, one of Fenty's former fraternity brothers. Attorney Robert Trout, whom the council appointed as the investigator, found that Fenty did nothing wrong, but Trout found possible wrongdoing by Karim and the stain of the investigation nagged Fenty in his losing 2010 race against Gray. Gray has a long history in Washington politics, dating back to his time as director of the D.C. Department of Human Services in 1991. During his time as director, he grew the size and scope of the department and came to be known as a vocal advocate for the district's homeless community. Gray was first elected to the Council of the District of Columbia, the governing body where Gray made most of his political name, in 2004. When the chairman of the council decided not to seek re-election in 2006, Gray ran for the chairmanship and won. He ran as a unifying candidate, with a campaign slogan of ""One City,"" and pledged to unite a city that had long seen distinct social and racial divides. Gray reused the ""One City"" mantra in his 2010 race for mayor. But according to political analyst Mark Plotkin, Gray's time as mayor may be short-lived. According to the longtime D.C. political analyst, Gray is losing legitimacy. ""My feeling is that it's just a matter of time,"" Plotkin said. ""The political and the legal pressure, working almost together, I just don't know what he comes up with as a rebuttal. And even if it is proven that he had nothing to do with this, and is exonerated, his legitimacy is so much in question.""","Gray faces heat over investigation into his campaign funding .

"Washington (CNN) -- If California's Kevin McCarthy ascends as expected to the No. 2 Republican leadership position in the House, one thing is assured: He will be dogged by the ever-present political specter of immigration reform. McCarthy's backers are hastily shoring up support for his candidacy as majority leader, but so are immigration reform advocates who want to make clear to him their expectations for action. Labrador jumps into race for House majority leader . Texan Sessions drops bid to succeed Cantor in House leadership . ""There is no reason for Congressman Kevin McCarthy, as leader, not to take leadership on this issue,"" said immigration reform activist Arturo Rodriguez, president of United Farm Workers. ""Everyone will expect it and demand it. And we will step up all of our activities as a whole."" Such is the thorny predicament for the politically savvy lawmaker viewed as most likely to succeed Eric Cantor as majority leader. Cantor's primary loss in Virginia set in a motion a scramble for the position. Then again, McCarthy, who actor Kevin Spacey reportedly shadowed in preparing for his role as majority whip Frank Underwood in the Netflix series ""House of Cards,"" is used to such plot twists. Is D.C. real life ""House of Cards""? McCarthy's own rapid rise is the stuff of a political soap opera. He is the boy from Bakersfield who married his high school sweetheart and plunked down money he won in a lottery to start a deli. He used those earnings to go to college before entering politics. His boss, former House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas endorsed his young staffer to replace him in 2006. Since then, McCarthy has easily won every subsequent re-election and has risen quickly â€” and shrewdly, friends say â€” through the House GOP's leadership ranks. He's now considered the frontrunner for the majority leader's job. ""We've been friends for many, many years now, but he looks at things differently,"" said fellow California Republican Rep. Jeff Denham. ""He has the foresight to know when to push and when not to push and he understands when's the right time to get something done."" For example, McCarthy last year voted with many House Republicans, but not Denham, to defund the Obama administration's efforts to halt the deportation of young immigrants in the military or in school. This year, he's supporting Denham's measure to help provide a path to citizenship for young immigrants who are also members of the military. Doing the math . Down but not done: Cantor's loss not end for immigration reform . That's not to say there haven't been stumbles and miscalculations. McCarthy became the party whip soon after the Republican takeover of the House. But his ability to count and rally votes behind leadership's priorities were tested after partisan battles over raising the debt ceiling and funding food stamps. McCarthy's affability has been key to helping soothe ruffled feathers, friends say. Fellow California Rep. David Valadao counts McCarthy as ""both a close friend and a respected colleague,"" and he's gotten a chance to see the would-be majority leader up close as they and others in the delegation worked together on issues of providing water to their Central Valley region as well as infrastructure needs, he told CNN in a statement. McCarthy often orders takeout and invites House members to his office to eat and talk about issues affecting their districts, their spouses and children, Denham said. ""He invites members to his office and it's like sitting around the family dinner table,"" he said. ""He also takes the time to go to people's districts all across the nation."" A tale of two Republicans: A story of the GOP and immigration reform . Careful calculations . Friends say McCarthy, 49, will need that personal touch for crafting relationships and a sense of timing on hot button issues, should he be elected leader next Thursday. That's because fallout from tackling immigration reform could prove politically perilous if Cantor, who has endorsed McCarthy, is any indication. Dave Brat used Cantor's willingness to consider a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants to hammer home his point that he'd lost touch with his constituents. That, analysts say, was crucial to his victory in the reliably conservative Richmond-area district. ""I think his (McCarthy's) views on immigration are similar to Cantor's,"" said Steven Camarota, director of research for the non-profit Center for Immigration Studies. ""But after this week's results, it seems much less likely he would push it. And even less likely still that he would move his members to push it."" Conservatives are pushing aggressively to have one of their own fill McCarthy's current job as whip and join the House GOP leadership ranks, which would create an interesting dynamic between the top two Republicans in the House and the whip. GOP ""trapped"" by amnesty . McCarthy's home turf is California's 23rd congressional district, a Republican stronghold ripe with lush farmland in the shadow of mountain ranges. It is also a place that is 35% Latino and where the local business community has made clear that it depends heavily on immigrant labor to pick such crops as grapes, oranges and tomatoes. ""We have spoken with Congressman McCarthy and his staff about immigration reform and its importance to our local and regional economy,"" Cynthia Pollard, president and CEO of the Greater Bakersfield Chamber of Commerce told CNN in a statement. ""I led a delegation of several other business leaders in a meeting with Congressman McCarthy last fall in Washington, D.C., to discuss the issue. He expressed at that time and has since reaffirmed his commitment to a step-by-step assessment and overhaul of the system that is clearly broken."" In the meantime, immigration advocates who have hosted protests and sit-ins at McCarthy's district offices in the past vow they are poised to do so again if they sense he's unwilling to tackle reform. ""As the person responsible for scheduling House votes, when it comes to immigration reform McCarthy will either be a hero or a zero,"" Frank Sherry, executive director of America's Voice, an immigration reform advocacy group, said in a statement. ""He can save the GOP from itself by quickly scheduling a vote on historic legislation that the majority of the House, the country and even his district supports; or he can squander the opportunity. ...The future of the GOP may well hinge on his choice,"" he said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A needle is inside the body of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, traveling along his veins and poking at his organs. This piercing imagery is used by the pro-democracy activist in his poem ""June Fourth in My Body"" dedicated to the year 2009 -- the same year he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion of state power. Prior to his arrest, Liu would write a poem every year around June 4 to commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing and those who lost their lives. ""He is really forcing himself to look at this in order that other people don't forget, because it has been such a publicly erased moment in history in China,"" says fellow poet Jeffrey Yang, who is based in the U.S. Liu was a fervent participant of the 1989 pro-democracy movement. He occupied Tiananmen Square, led hunger strikes, drafted public opinion polls and lobbied foreigners to donate toward the movement. On June 4, 1989, tanks entered the streets around Tiananmen Square and opened fire on demonstrators. Liu escaped relatively unscathed. Imprisonment . Two days after the crackdown, Liu was arrested and imprisoned for nearly 20 months. This was the first of many prison sentences that Liu would serve for speaking out against the Chinese leadership. Liu is currently serving his sentence and could not be reached. It is unclear whether he is able to continue his annual tradition of composing a poem to remember those who died on June 4, 1989. However, his works between 1990 and 2009 have been compiled into the anthology ""June Fourth Elegies,"" published in 2012. Yang translated the collection into English. ""June Fourth in My Body"" is the last entry in the collection and it particularly stands out for Yang. ""The very last poem in the collection is just heart breaking,"" he says. The poem likens the tragic crackdown to a rusting but still piercing needle that has been left inside the activist's body. ""June 4 was a life-changing and defining date for Liu. Besides, he has been struggling with feelings of guilt as a survivor of the incident,"" says Teng Biao, founder of the rights group China Against Death Penalty. Ending one-party rule . Teng, a well-known human rights lawyer, advised Liu in the drafting of Charter 08, a pro-democracy manifesto that called for an end to one-party rule. The document ultimately led to Liu's 2008 arrest and eventual sentencing in December 2009. In 2010, Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize while imprisoned. To mark the 25th anniversary of the June 4 massacre, we asked Teng to recite the first three stanzas of the moving poem in a recording (see above), and Yang to recite his English version. Translator Yang adds that: ""The collection is an annual return to the same event, over and over again. Sometimes he's in prison, sometimes he's at a bar, at other times he's at home, but the one thing that is striking is that as the years pass, the emotional content is still very much alive through his work.""","Jailed activist Liu Xiaobo was a participant of the 1989 pro-democracy movement .

"(Mashable) -- According to documents leaked to Boy Genius Report, AppleCare representatives are being given a strong company line to deliver to unhappy iPhone 4 owners who complain about reception issues. Employees are told to say that the device's reception performance ""is the best we have ever shipped"" and that its critical antenna flaws are ""a fact of life in the wireless world."" They are told not to perform service on iPhones with these problems and instead to give customers a PR-driven recitative instead. These statements are dead ringers for CEO Steve Jobs' own assertions that the iPhone 4 antenna and reception issues do not, in fact, exist. ""There is no reception issue,"" he told one user. But the very fact that this document exists suggests that Apple execs know there is indeed a widespread hardware flaw, even if they're unwilling to address it publicly at this time. After users complained about iPhone 4 reception problems, Apple released a written statement last week saying, ""Gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance, with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas."" An Apple spokesperson said Monday the company would have no further statements on the subject. Apple did not immediately respond Thursday to an e-mail seeking comment on the leaked documents. Outside the reality distortion field, on the other hand, Mashable and many other sites have been able to duplicate the issue being discussed: When held by its sides, which are composed of a metal antenna band, the phone's reception quality drops dramatically. iPhone owners in our newsroom have seen reception decrease from five to two bars simply from holding the phone with two points of contact between the owner's hand and the antenna band. One law firm is even preparing for a class-action lawsuit against Apple and is soliciting iPhone 4 customers to contact them about reception issues. Also, while some folks have reported that using a bumper case prevents contact with the antenna band and preserves reception quality, AppleCare reps are being told to not give bumper cases to disgruntled users. Here's the full text of the document as reported: . 1. Keep all of the positioning statements in the BN handy -- your tone when delivering this information is important. a. The iPhone 4's wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped. Our testing shows that iPhone 4's overall antenna performance is better than iPhone 3GS. b. Gripping almost any mobile phone in certain places will reduce its reception. This is true of the iPhone 4, the iPhone 3GS, and many other phones we have tested. It is a fact of life in the wireless world. c. If you are experiencing this on your iPhone 3GS, avoid covering the bottom-right side with your hand. d. If you are experiencing this on your iPhone 4, avoid covering the black strip in the lower-left corner of the metal band. e. The use of a case or Bumper that is made out of rubber or plastic may improve wireless performance by keeping your hand from directly covering these areas. 2. Do not perform warranty service. Use the positioning above for any customer questions or concerns. 3. Don't forget YOU STILL NEED to probe and troubleshoot. If a customer calls about their reception while the phone is sitting on a table (not being held) it is not the metal band. 4. ONLY escalate if the issue exists when the phone is not held AND you cannot resolve it. 5.

"(CNN) -- Food kits recently distributed as part of a disaster relief effort in Kentucky and Arkansas may contain peanut butter contaminated with salmonella linked to a nationwide outbreak, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Wednesday. People who received the food kits should throw away the peanut butter packets, FEMA says. ""Commercial meals kits manufactured by Red Cloud Food Services Inc., under the Standing Rock label, have been provided to disaster survivors in impacted communities, and these kits may contain peanut butter which is part of the precautionary national recall underway in accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,"" FEMA said in a written statement. Though the kits do not all contain the same main course, they do contain packets of peanut butter, the agency said. ""People who have received commercial meal kits are asked to inspect the kits in their possession and immediately dispose of any peanut butter packets,"" it said. Jay Blanton, spokesman for Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, said late Wednesday: ""We just received this information from FEMA. Tonight, out of an abundance of caution, we are in the process of finding alternative sources of food for people in shelters. The Kentucky National Guard is starting to notify people who've already received the (meal kits) or might be getting one."" Blanton estimated that 6,000 to 7,000 people remained in shelters, primarily in western Kentucky. Of officials' reactions to the salmonella warning, he said: ""We're pretty resilient. We've had a lot thrown in our way and we're coming through it. FEMA has been working closely with us, and they assure us this is a precautionary measure."" The meals were sent in the wake of President Barack Obama's federal disaster declarations for Kentucky and Arkansas after they were hammered last week with rain, ice and snow. No one at Red Cloud Food Services, based in South Elgin, Illinois, responded immediately to e-mails. The meals were sent in the wake of President Barack Obama's federal disaster declarations for Kentucky and Arkansas after they were hammered last week with rain, ice and snow.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich sacked coach Louis van Gaal Sunday after poor results threatened their participation in next season's Champions League. The Dutchman was due to step down at the end of the season, but the board of the Bavarian giants held an emergency meeting after their disappointing 1-1 draw against Nuremberg Saturday and took the decision to replace him immediately. A statement on the club's official website said the decision had been taken in the ""interests of the club as a whole."" It added that the draw meant Bayern had slipped back into fourth place in the Bundesliga ""increasing the danger of the club failing to hit its minimum target for the season, the chance of qualifying for the UEFA Champions League."" Van Gaal, 59, was informed of his sacking on return from Nuremberg. His assistants Frans Hoek, Jos van Dijk and Max Reckers have also been relieved of their duties. Andries Jonker has been placed in temporary charge until the end of the season. Van Gaal took Bayern to the domestic double last season and they lost in the final of the Champions League to Inter Milan. But their form in the German league this season has been poor, trailing runaway leaders Borussia Dortmund, while defeat to Inter in their Champions League last 16 clash last month ended their hopes of silverware. Currently in fourth, Bayern need to finish in the top two to gain automatic entry into the Champions League next season, with third place going into the final qualifying round. Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told AFP that they had been considering the decision to sack van Gaal for weeks. ""It is true we have taken a short-term decision but there has been dissatisfaction -- I have to make this clear -- for weeks,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, it is the responsibility of the club to do everything we can to get third place. ""In terms of the decision, we simply didn't have an alternative."" Bayer Leverkusen's coach Jupp Heynckes has already been announced as Bayern's head coach for next season. His current side cut Borussia Dortmund's lead at the top of the Bundesliga to just five points Sunday as they came from behind to seal a 2-1 home win over relegation battlers St Pauli. Dortmund were held to a 1-1 draw at Hamburg Saturday, but second-placed Leverkusen fell behind until Germany striker Stefan Kiessling equalized before Lars Bender scored the crucial winner.","Bayern Munich sack coach Louis van Gaal with immediate effect .

"London, England (CNN) -- Hit the road, Jack. Last year's most popular name for baby boys in England has been knocked off -- by Mohammed. That's not immediately obvious from data put out this week by the Office of National Statistics, which declared Wednesday that Oliver was the single most popular name for boys born in 2009. But a CNN analysis of the top 4,500 boys names shows that, when different spellings of the name are lumped together, Mohammed is No. 1. Oliver and variations come second, followed by Jack, Thomas, Charles, Harry, William and Daniel. The United Kingdom is about 4.6 percent Muslim, with just under 2.9 million Muslims according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. And Muslims have a strong tendency to name their sons Mohammed. ""The first reason why people keep the children's name Mohammed is because of their love of the prophet Mohammed, because they want to emulate him,"" said Imam Abdullah al-Hasan of the East London Mosque. ""They want to copy him not just through his behavior and conduct, but also his name,"" said the imam, who is thinking about naming his own newborn son after the founder of Islam. The Muslim population has risen rapidly in Western Europe in the past 20 years, according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. From under 10 million in 1990, it's gone up to about 17 million today, the think tank said in a report last month. That has be accompanied by tensions ranging from racial violence in parts of England to legal restrictions like banning the burqa in France and banning minarets in Switzerland. But al-Hasan says Britain has nothing to fear. ""One message I would give to them is that you shouldn't be surprised. You shouldn't be scared. You shouldn't be frightened or anything like that,"" he said. ""It shows that Islam is here to stay in Britain. Islam is here to stay in Europe,"" he said. ""It's not alien from the Western society.

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell holds a slim four-point edge over his Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes in a new CNN/ORC International Poll of one of the most closely watched Senate races of 2014. McConnell's 4-point advantage, 50%-46%, falls within the survey's 4-point sampling error, furthering emphasizing how close this Kentucky contest remains 62 days before Election Day. The outcome of this election may help decide control of the Senate, influence President Barack Obama's final two years in office and determine the political fate of Kentucky's longest-serving senator. Data from the poll offers both hope and challenges for each candidate over the next two months, as outside groups and the individual candidates continue to pour millions of dollars into this race to try to influence Kentuckians on whom to support in November. That sliver of persuadable voters might be as small as 19%, which is the number of people who said they ""might change their mind."" In contrast, 77% of those surveyed said they ""made up their mind"" about whom they will back in November. What might be a troubling data point for Grimes is the number of Democrats -- 16% -- who said they are supporting or leaning towards supporting McConnell. ""That 16% may not sound like much, but it's more than double the number of crossover votes that Grimes wins from Republicans,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""It's likely that there are some Democrats who think that their state is better off with a Kentuckian running the Senate rather than a Democrat who would rank at the very bottom in seniority."" And that is a main talking point for McConnell on the campaign trail, a senator who speaks about how he delivers for Kentuckians while maintaining conservative sensibilities. He also embraces his role as one of Obama's biggest critics, which in many ways is low-hanging fruit in a commonwealth that overwhelmingly disapproves of how the commander-in-chief is handling his job. Obama has a 64% disapproval rating in the poll among all respondents, while only 29% approve of his stewardship of the country. The president's high disapproval rating is fueled in part by his policy on coal -- a major employer in parts of Kentucky. In fact, McConnell has a whopping 20% lead over Grimes in the east and a 28% lead over her in the west, the two coal-producing regions in the commonwealth. It is no surprise that Grimes has not embraced Obama, and has even chastised him publicly for his position on coal. ""She has made it quite clear where she stands on coal,"" said a Democratic strategist who spoke freely about the race on the condition of anonymity. ""And she has a starkly different approach to Kentucky's coal industry than President Obama and some national Democrats."" What is troubling for McConnell is that despite being one of the most powerful Republicans in the nation, he is locked in a statistical tie with Grimes who holds a 10-point lead over McConnell in the Bluegrass region (anchored by the cities of Lexington and Frankfort), a 27-point lead over McConnell in the Jefferson County area (anchored by the city of Louisville), and an 8-point lead over McConnell in the suburbs of Louisville and Cincinnati. The poll indicates a controversy that erupted Friday that forced McConnell's campaign manager to resign has not had a major impact on this race. Jesse Benton cut ties with the campaign as speculation swirled about his involvement in an unfolding corruption scandal related to then-Rep. Ron Paul's 2012 bid for president. The bottom line for McConnell is that he is the No. 1 target of national Democrats. A Republican strategist acknowledged as much saying that Democratic leaders have framed this race to their donor base as an opportunity to defeat a major opponent to the Democratic agenda. National Democratic money will continue to flow into Kentucky. Digging deeper into the data, there are no real surprises in terms of which candidate is winning traditional political demographic groups: McConnell has a 13% lead with men and is seen more favorably by voters who make $50,000 or more, while Grimes holds a seven-point lead with women and does better with voters making less than $50,000. Democrats view the Kentucky Senate race twofold: an opportunity to defeat a Republican leader, a major symbolic victory that last occurred in 2004 when then-Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, was defeated by former Rep. John Thune; and more important for Democrats, the Kentucky race is a key part of the political beachhead needed to protect their vulnerable Senate majority in November. For Republicans to take back control of the Senate floor and the committees that produce legislation and provide oversight of the Obama administration, the party needs a net gain of six seats -- a very doable task given the math and electoral map two months before Election Day, even though Democrats currently hold a 55-45 seat advantage in the chamber. To start, Democrats need to defend 21 seats in November, while the GOP only needs to protect 15. Take a closer look at the 36 Senate seats on the ballot this year and the news is even more disturbing for Democrats. At least three seats currently held by Democrats -- Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia -- are expected to be won by Republicans on November 4, according to the most recent CNN analysis of the 2014 midterm election. And of the six seats that CNN designated as ""Up for Grabs,"" five are held by Democratic incumbents representing Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana and North Carolina. At this time, Kentucky is the only GOP-held seat that CNN has placed in the ""Up for Grabs"" column. So, while there are many competitive Senate races in this election, Kentucky is viewed as the premier contest heading into November. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International, which interviewed 1,037 adult Americans, including 671 likely voters, by telephone between August 28 and September 1. The sampling error for results for likely voters is +/-4 percentage points.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani officials have arrested a suspect in connection with the gruesome 2002 beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Qari Abdul Hayee is believed to be the one who facilitated Pearl's kidnapping, a senior Pakistani official said. The official, who had direct knowledge of the arrest, did not want to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Pearl was kidnapped while researching a story in Karachi about Pakistani militants and the so-called ""shoe bomber"" Richard Reid. He was later decapitated, and a video of his killing was sent to U.S. officials. The chilling video . In addition to showing violent footage of Pearl's death, the video also showed Pearl discussing his Jewish heritage and making propaganda statements, apparently under duress. The tape began with the correspondent saying, ""My name is Daniel Pearl. I'm a Jewish-American."" ""My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish. I am a Jew,"" he said. Then, looking at the camera, he recounted numerous family visits to Israel and noted that a street in a town in Israel was named after his great-grandfather, who was one of the founders of the town. On the tape, the group that claimed responsibility for Pearl's abduction -- the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistan's Sovereignty -- demanded that Pakistanis being held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, be released. The group also demanded an end to the U.S. presence in Pakistan end as well as the delivery of F-16 fighter jets, which Pakistan purchased from the United States but never received. Photos of hands backed up Pearl slaying confession, report finds . The arrest . Hayee was arrested Sunday in a paramilitary operation targeting militants in Karachi. ""It was a covert operation based on intelligence information,"" the Pakistani official said. Troops also recovered weapons during the raid that netted Hayee, the official said. Other suspects . Hayee joins several other suspects who have been arrested in connection with Pearl's kidnapping and murder. Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British-born Islamic militant, was sentenced to death by hanging by an anti-terrorism court in Hyderabad in connection with Pearl's murder. Three accomplices received life sentences, which in Pakistan usually means 25 years. In 2003, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- who is also a suspected mastermind of the 9/11 attacks on the United States -- was arrested in Pakistan and has confessed to killing Pearl. Federal agents backed up Mohammed's confession by comparing photos of the veins in his hands and the vein patterns of an assailant in the video of Pearl's killing, according to a report by Georgetown University students and faculty and the Center for Public Integrity. But Mohammed has not been charged in Pearl's death. According to the report, U.S. officials decided against bringing charges in the Pearl case to avoid complicating Mohammed's prosecution for the 9/11 attacks. Al Qaeda expert Rohan Gunaratna said Mohammed ordered Pearl's death. ""Daniel Pearl was going in search of the al Qaeda network that was operational in Karachi, and it was at the instruction of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed that Daniel Pearl was killed,"" Gunaratna said. Obama signs Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act . Words from his widow . Pearl's death should be a global wake-up call about ""a vast and international network of terrorists,"" his widow said. ""I know Danny has not been defeated"" by those who killed him, Mariane Pearl told CNN weeks after her husband's death. ""His spirit, his faith and his conviction have not been defeated."" She said governments across the world must take responsibility for fighting terror and citizens should take an active role in considering their countries' foreign policies. ""If people in the world do not realize that they're not immune against this anymore, then nothing will,"" she said.

"Paris (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lambasted Russia and China on Friday for blocking efforts to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has lost a key general to defection. Speaking at the Friends of Syria conference in Paris, Clinton called on Russia and China to ""get off the sidelines"" and accused them of ""standing up for"" al-Assad's regime. She urged the other 100 or so nations and organizations represented at the summit to ""make it clear that Russia and China will pay a price"" for that position. ""I ask you to reach out to Russia and China and not only ask but demand that they get off the sidelines,"" she said. ""I don't think Russia and China believe they are paying any price at all, nothing at all, for standing with (the) Assad regime."" High-ranking general defects from Syrian military . But it was unclear whether those two nations would reverse their long-standing opposition to forcing al-Assad from power. The two trade partners of Syria have vetoed previous efforts by the U.N. Security Council to condemn the violence in Syria and oust al-Assad. Neither Russia nor China was represented at the Paris meeting. Western and Arab nations started the Friends of Syria initiative because China and Russia posed diplomatic obstacles to tackling the Syrian crisis. The United States and others said they were hoping that Friday's meeting could lead to stricter economic sanctions and more support for the opposition. Speaking after the meeting concluded, Clinton argued for additional sanctions to be backed by a Security Council resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter. Chapter 7 could ultimately authorize the use of force. ""No transition plan can progress as long as the regime's brutal assaults continue,"" she said. ""That's why the entire world is looking at those few nations who have influence in Damascus."" Clinton warned allies of al-Assad within Syria that evidence of abuses is being collected and that they should ""get on the right side of history."" She added: ""Let me say to the soldiers and officials still supporting the Syrian regime -- the Syrian people will remember the choices you make in the coming days."" Clinton's comments came as a Western diplomat said that Brig. Gen. Manaf Tlas of Syria's Republican Guards has abandoned the regime. Tlas, the son of a former Syrian defense minister, defected over the killing of Sunnis, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official was not authorized to speak to the media. ""He's an inside confidant of Assad,"" the official said. ""So it counts that even an insider thinks it's time to go."" The defector's father and the rest of his family are in Paris, the official said. Western officials told CNN that Tlas was en route to Paris. It was not immediately known if he had joined the Syrian opposition. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, speaking at the end of the Friends of Syria meeting, called the defection of someone close to al-Assad a ""hard blow"" for the regime. ""We are told of the defection of someone quite important in the regime, very close to Bashar al-Assad, which means that his close entourage is starting to understand that the regime is unsustainable,"" he said. Fabius said he did not know what the final destination would be for the defector, whom he did not identify by name but said was a member of the Republican Guard and a longtime friend of al-Assad. Asked about the defection, Clinton did not name Tlas, but said an ""increasing stream of military defectors"" is leaving Syria. ""Regime insiders and the military establishment are starting to vote with their feet,"" she said. ""Those who have the closest knowledge of Assad's actions and crimes are moving away, and we think that's a very promising development. And it also raises questions for those who remain in Damascus."" Friends of Syria meeting in Paris . The defection is one more setback for al-Assad, who Clinton said has been feeling the bite of economic sanctions. The Syrian leader's ""currency and foreign reserves have collapsed,"" she said, curbing his ability to continue his crackdown. But she said challenges remain. Al-Assad was being kept afloat by ""money from Iran and assistance from Russia and the failure of countries here"" at the conference to tighten economic sanctions. ""None of us is satisfied or comfortable with what is going on in Syria,"" she said. But since the Friends of Syria met in Tunis in February, ""there has been a steady march toward ending this regime,"" Clinton said. Fabius said Friday's meeting showed that the international community is uniting to voice support for the opposition, promise increased humanitarian aid for the Syrian people and back sanctions against the regime. ""Today was not a good day for the regime,"" he said. The Paris meeting comes less than a week after a conference of foreign ministers, which included China and Russia, met in Geneva, Switzerland, and called for a transitional government body as a step toward ending the Syrian crisis. That emergency meeting, called by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, raised hopes that Russia was easing its position. But even as Russia appeared to agree that a key step in the peace process would be the establishment of a transitional government, the country's foreign minister said it should not be viewed as outside powers imposing a transitional government on Syrians. Senior U.S. officials said the United States and its European and Arab partners will move to impose global sanctions if Syria doesn't quickly implement the transition plan that includes the appointment of a new government. Diplomats at the United Nations are working on a document that would demand restrictions on oil and other commercial business with the Syrian regime if it refuses to implement the Annan peace plan for a cease-fire and a transitional government. A Security Council resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter could be introduced next week, the officials said. Clinton's marathon trip tackles a range of U.S. foreign policy issues . The officials said the Russian and Chinese willingness to discuss a political transition plan in Syria and sign on to that plan last week in Geneva could boost the effort to impose sanctions. The absence of the two nations from the Paris conference, however, could reflect the difficulties ahead in persuading Moscow and Beijing to back the resolution. Clinton praised the Syrian opposition's six-page ""vision"" for a Syrian transition that was unveiled last week at its meeting in Cairo, Egypt. The United States hopes the document, which has details on a new parliament and constitution, will allay fears of Alawites and other minority groups that the Sunnis leading the fight against al-Assad will grab all of the power and take revenge on al-Assad's supporters. The regime is dominated by Alawites, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, and the opposition is largely Sunni. French President FranÃ§ois Hollande also called for al-Assad's departure Friday, saying a political transition is the only way to end 16 months of violence in the Middle East nation. Members of the Syrian opposition attended the Paris meeting, and many are pushing for the imposition of a no-fly zone in Syria. Opposition groups reported dozens of deaths on Friday. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria counted at least 89 people. Meanwhile, a Turkish foreign ministry official told CNN that two children were killed and six Syrian refugees were injured when a gas canister exploded Friday at the Yayladagi refugee camp in southeastern Turkey.

"(CNN) -- Hal Turner, an online radio ""shock jock"" and blogger, was convicted on Friday of threatening to kill three federal judges in Chicago, Illinois, in retaliation for a ruling they made that upheld handgun bans, government officials said. Turner was arrested and charged in June 2009 for posting incendiary comments that said the judges involved in the case deserved to be killed. The three judges he threatened, who had upheld a ban on handguns in Chicago and the Oak Park suburb, testified at the trial. ""There is no place in society for threatening federal judges with violence. Period. We are grateful that the jury saw these threats for what they were and rejected any notion that they were acceptable speech,"" Patrick J.Fitzgerald, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois said in a statement after the conviction. A sentencing date was not set. Turner faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. An after-hours call to Turner's lawyer, Peter Kirchheimer, was not immediately returned. Turner, no stranger to controversy, wrote online after the federal appeals court ruling in 2009: ""Let me be the first to say this plainly: These judges deserve to be killed."" Turner had been referring to Chief Judge Frank Easterbrook and Judges Richard Posner and William Bauer of the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Justice Department officials said. The post included photographs of the judges, their phone numbers, addresses and a map of the building where they work. Turner's conviction came at the end of a third trial. Two previous trials ended in mistrials after juries said they were deadlocked. Turner has been known to post the names and home addresses of judges he believes are on the wrong side of conservative issues, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups. About former President George W. Bush, Turner once said: ""A well-placed bullet can solve a lot of problems,"" according to the center's website. It adds Turner has also written that ""we need to start SHOOTING AND KILLING Mexicans as they cross the border"" and has argued that killing certain federal judges ""may be illegal, but it wouldn't be wrong.""","Turner faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. congressman is questioning whether the NCAA failed to hold the University of North Carolina accountable during a 2012 academic fraud investigation and is demanding answers from NCAA brass. If he doesn't get them, he'll call for congressional hearings and subpoena NCAA President Mark Emmert, Rep. Tony Cardenas told CNN. The California Democrat is referring to a probe in which the National Collegiate Athletic Association investigated UNC's system of ""paper classes"" -- independent studies requiring little work and no attendance. Athletes were able to get easy ""A""s without actually going to class. The NCAA declined to sanction the university, saying the scandal was academic in nature, not athletic. However, whistle-blower Mary Willingham has said that paper classes were openly discussed as a way to keep athletes eligible to play, and former football player Michael McAdoo said he was forced into majoring in African-American studies, the department at the heart of the paper-classes scandal. ""I think it's important to know if they are looking the other way,"" Cardenas said. ""I think it's very suspicious."" CNN analysis: Some college athletes play like adults, read like 5th-graders . Cardenas' call for an explanation could have implications for the NCAA, as it's involved in three court cases aiming to dissolve the long-standing amateur model and give players more rights -- and possibly salaries. Meanwhile, the Student-Athletes Human Rights Project has filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education over UNC's paper classes. The student-athlete advocacy group, based in Durham, North Carolina, alleges the classes violated Title IX because the number of male students taking them was disproportionate, and Title VI because too many black students took them. As more critics are emerging and speaking publicly about the way the NCAA handled the UNC case, the NCAA is standing by its assertion that athletes are paid with an education, are students first and should not receive salaries. Critics say that model is flawed because many athletes do not get an education. ""Kids who are walking out of these schools cannot read. They are getting degrees that are worthless,"" said Tom McMillen, a former congressman and basketball player who now serves as secretary for the University System of Maryland Board of Regents, speaking on the issue of NCAA reform last week at the nonprofit Aspen Institute. ""I think the chink in the armor of the NCAA is that they say you're going to get an education."" In a Monday phone interview with CNN, McMillen stated his opinion succinctly: ""If these kids aren't getting an education, the whole thing's a sham."" Emmett Gill, a former NCAA adviser and current head of the Student-Athletes Human Rights Project, raised the same point in a letter to Emmert asking for a renewed investigation at UNC. Gill said he believes the NCAA and UNC are ignoring the alleged academic fraud to protect the amateur model. If the NCAA were to admit that athletes are not getting an education, it would be devastating to the organization, Gill said. Two former college athletic officials-turned-reform advocates -- Gerald Gurney at the University of Oklahoma and David Ridpath at the University of Ohio -- also recently began reviewing academic fraud cases for which the NCAA handed down punishments, comparing them to UNC. They believe the data will demonstrate that the NCAA is ignoring the problem. ""They do pick and choose,"" Ridpath said. ""The NCAA is abdicating their responsibility, and there is a clear and convincing case of academic fraud the NCAA is overlooking."" But the NCAA's investigation is over despite recent revelations from McAdoo and Willingham's public statements. When reached for comment, the NCAA said its ""rules only govern academic fraud as it relates to athletics departments and student-athletes. Any broader issue is not under the NCAA's purview."" In 2012, the NCAA did go to Chapel Hill to investigate. It was alleged that about a dozen players had dealings with agents -- a big NCAA violation. Then, information surfaced suggesting one of the most prestigious public universities in the country had been passing athletes through classes that they never had to attend. There was talk that the allegations could deliver a devastating blow to the institution, perhaps even going back to its 2005 and 2009 basketball championships. But that didn't happen. While the football team had to vacate wins and forgo scholarships because of the agent scandal, little came of the academic fraud probe. The NCAA came to town, punished a few players and left, finding no evidence of institutional fraud. Willingham was never contacted or interviewed, and UNC was left to police itself. The school instituted more than 180 reforms to make sure paper classes did not continue. But no one asked why: Why did UNC need to create these easy-A classes? Who came up with the idea? Who knew about it? McAdoo was one of the players caught up in the scandal. A defensive end recruit with numerous Division I coaches trying to woo him, McAdoo chose North Carolina, not just to play ball, but because he wanted to major in criminal justice. He wanted an education, he said. ""When the coaches and academic staff came to my house all the way in Tennessee, you know they wasn't even talking football. They was talking academics,"" McAdoo said. ""So they were saying, 'You know what? We can't promise your son that he's going to go to the NFL, but one thing that we can promise him is that he will get a college degree.' "" They didn't make good on that promise, he said. On his second day of school, athletic advising handed him a schedule and told him what classes he'd be taking. None of them was related to criminal justice. Instead, there was an African-American studies class, something McAdoo says he had no interest in. He felt ""lied to,"" he said. When the academic fraud scandal broke, the NCAA said one of McAdoo's tutors had done too much work for him. ""The university knew what was going on and they knew I was taking paper classes and they kind of swept it under the rug,"" he said. He was declared academically ineligible, and right before his senior season, he says he felt forced to leave Carolina. And after a short stint with the Baltimore Ravens, he went to the Canadian Football League, where he's now playing. McAdoo and his attorney, former North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Bob Orr, say they feel like the NCAA picked on McAdoo while ignoring the larger institutional problem. ""The individual players were singled out,"" Orr said. ""Literally thrown under the bus, in my opinion, by the way the enforcement process works, and I think the university hoped and the NCAA was compliant with the sense of 'OK, we've punished the players. Let's move on.'"" UNC has long insisted that the paper classes were solely the idea of one man -- now-indicted professor Julius Nyang'oro, who was head of the African-American studies department. Two internal reviews commissioned by the university found there was no evidence that counselors or anyone in the athletics department knew about the abuse. UNC's athletic reform Chairwoman Joy Renner told CNN that she believes the students found the easy classes by word of mouth and that UNC officials were stunned as to why Nyang'oro would offer paper classes. McAdoo says that's not true, and Willingham told CNN that paper classes were openly discussed within the athletics department as a way to keep athletes eligible. ""In the building, almost everyone would have talked about it,"" she said, referring to working in athletics. ""And outside of the athletic department, some other people that were involved in advising certainly knew about the paper class system."" Willingham, who has studied athlete literacy for years and has personally worked with the athletes who were part of her study, previously told CNN for an exclusive story that there are athletes at UNC who are reading at elementary school levels. Some of the athletes who were pushed into paper classes were put there because they weren't reading at high enough levels to succeed in legitimate courses at North Carolina, she said. There are athletes -- including some who played on the 2009 championship basketball team -- who took as many as 12 paper classes, Willingham said, adding that it's telling that one key indicator of graduation rates dropped significantly once the paper classes were uncovered and brought to an end. ""They were used for students who were in the NCAA tournament. They were used for students who were going to world competition, like soccer players. They were used for the Olympics,"" Willingham said of the paper classes. ""They were used for summer classes for students who were playing baseball on the coast. They were used for students who were having eligibility issues."" UNC officials have attacked Willingham's credibility and disavowed her research, saying of her research suggesting some athletes read at elementary school levels: ""We do not believe that claim and find it patently unfair to the many student-athletes who have worked hard in the classroom and on the court and represented our university with distinction."" But since she spoke to CNN, UNC has commissioned yet another investigation of the paper classes scandal. This time, Ken Wainstein, a former Homeland Security adviser to President George W. Bush, is doing the review. He has already spoken to Willingham and Debbie Crowder, Nyang'oro's secretary, and has talked to Crowder about the other people in athletics who were aware of paper classes, according to Crowder's attorney. While Nyang'oro faces a criminal fraud charge, the district attorney announced earlier this year that Crowder will not be charged, and unless more information is revealed, the active investigation is over.","A congressman questions the NCAA's decision not to sanction UNC in fake class scandal .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Somewhere in southern Russia, a convoy of 280 white-painted trucks snaked its way Tuesday toward the Ukrainian border. Depending on whom you ask, what's inside may either be a treasure trove of relief goods for war-weary civilians, or the vanguard of a Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine. With thousands of Russian troops still posted near the Ukrainian border and Ukraine's military putting increasing pressure on pro-Russian fighters around the city of Donetsk, many in Ukraine and elsewhere feared the latter. ""Russia keeps inventing new excuses for their policy,"" Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister, Danylo Lubkivsky, told reporters Tuesday in Kiev. ""In Georgia, it was defending pro-Russian minorities. In Ukraine's Crimea, preventing NATO invasion."" ""In Donbas,"" he said referring to the war-torn eastern region of Ukraine that includes the contested cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, ""they are trying to use the pretext of humanitarian aid and assistance."" Without offering proof, Ukrainian officials have even accused Russia of repainting military vehicles white to disguise their efforts. In Kiev, where many loyalties lie with the Ukrainian government, skepticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin's motive was rampant among ordinary residents. ""Normal people do not send guns to kill people and food for them to eat in the same cars,"" said IT specialist Igor Vlasenko. ""I think most Ukrainians want him to leave Ukraine alone. We can help ourselves."" And it's not just the Ukrainians raising concerns about a possible Russian Trojan horse. Red Cross flummoxed . In an interview Monday with Reuters, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen spoke of a ""high probability"" Russia will invade Ukraine. ""We see the Russians developing the narrative and the pretext for such an operation under the guise of a humanitarian operation and we see a military buildup that could be used to conduct such illegal military operations in Ukraine,"" he said. Russia has acknowledged sending the convoy. In a conversation Monday with the President of the European Commission, Putin said his country was working with the International Committee of the Red Cross to deliver aid to civilians suffering as a result of savage fighting there. Except the Red Cross says it doesn't know what Putin is talking about. ICRC spokesman Andrew Loersch said the agency doesn't have any agreement with Russia on such a convoy. And ICRC European operations chief Laurent Corbaz said Tuesday in Geneva that the agency hasn't gotten much clarity from Moscow about its purported role in the operation, including how the aid would be handed over and security guarantees for Red Cross workers. ""We said that we could be on board, but that we needed to have some clarification first regarding modalities, practical steps that have to be implemented prior to a launch of such an operation,"" he said. Red Cross officials don't even know what's in the shipment, Corbaz said. According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, the shipment is bound for Luhansk and contains 400 tons of grains, 100 tons of sugar, 62 tons of baby food, 54 tons of medical supplies, sleeping bags and ""electrical power units."" ""False pretense"" But after an incident Saturday in which Ukrainian officials claim to have stopped a purported aid convoy accompanied by Russian troops, Ukraine has vowed to stop any ""uncertified"" aid convoy from Russia. In the reported Saturday incident, Ukraine's Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration Valeriy Chaly, told a Ukrainian television channel that the convoy was nothing more than a Russian provocation. ""Under a false pretense of agreement with the International Committee of the Red Cross in Ukraine, a humanitarian convoy of 'peacekeepers' was ready to enter the country, apparently in order to provoke a full-scale conflict,"" he said. U.S. officials have warned Russia against using aid as a means of wading deeper into the Ukraine conflict. At a U.N. Security Council meeting Saturday, U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said Russia has no business delivering aid in Ukraine when international aid groups are better equipped to do the job. ""Therefore, any further unilateral intervention by Russia into Ukrainian territory -- including one under the guise of providing humanitarian aid -- would be completely unacceptable and deeply alarming,"" she said. ""And it would be viewed as an invasion of Ukraine."" Secretary of State John Kerry made a similar point with his Russian counterpart on Saturday, according to the State Department. While Western leaders have refused any suggestion that Russian acts could draw NATO nations into war over Ukraine, they do say it would lead to even stricter economic sanctions against Russia than those already imposed by the United States and the European Union. So far, Russian officials have shrugged off the sanctions. Rebels on the ropes? Moscow's decision to send the convoy comes as some 50,000 Ukrainian troops press forward with an offensive to rout rebel fighters from Donetsk. They have put increasing pressure on the rebel fighters, and Ukrainian officials say they expect to be able to fully recapture the city by Ukraine's Independence Day on August 24. The ongoing fighting -- sparked last year with a political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia -- has left more than 2,000 people dead and just under 5,000 wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April, according to estimates from U.N. officials. They say that the death toll has been on the rise in recent days, with reports of at least 41 killed and 143 wounded on Thursday alone. Hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee their homes and seek shelter either elsewhere in Ukraine or across the border in Russia, the United Nations says.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Moshe Katsav, the former Israeli president, began a seven-year prison sentence on Wednesday for rape and other sexual offenses. Two days after his 66th birthday, Katsav arrived at the Maasiyahu Prison in Ramla, central Israel, where he will be kept in a cell block for prisoners who are observant Jews. """"The five and a half years of battle come to an end in anger and frustration,"" Katsav said as he left his home surrounded by well wishers. He insisted the evidence against him was flawed. The case involved three women -- two in the president's office and one in the tourism ministry. A three judge panel last year found Katsav guilty of two charges of rape, two charges of forceful sexual harassment and one charge of sexual harassment. He was sentenced in in March. He had agreed in 2007 to plead guilty to lesser charges and pay a fine to avoid jail time, but withdrew from the deal when the moment came to enter his plea. After the verdict, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was a ""sad day"" for Israel. Katsav, of the center-right Likud Party, was president of Israel from 2000 to 2007. He was minister of tourism before that. The charges stem from allegations made against him in both jobs. As an inmate of the block for religious prisoners, Katsav will not be required to wear a prison uniform.

"(CNN) -- Over the weekend the United States launched drone strikes in two different locations in Yemen, killing at least 15 militants as well as three civilians. At the same time, Yemeni ground forces began what have been termed ""unprecedented"" operations against al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, which may also involve additional U.S. drone strikes, although that isn't clear right now. The U.S. drone campaign in Yemen is very much President Obama's war. Unlike in Pakistan, where President George W. Bush significantly ramped up the CIA drone campaign while he was in office, there was only one drone strike in Yemen during Bush's two terms in office. During Obama's administration, there have been 92 drone attacks, as well as a further 15 U.S. strikes using other forms of weaponry such as cruise missiles, according to a count by the New America Foundation. Indeed, Obama vastly accelerated the drone campaign in Yemen in 2011 and 2012, just as CIA drone strikes in Pakistan began to slow. Forty-seven strikes took place in Yemen in 2012, marking the first time the number of drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan reached comparable levels. One reason for this acceleration in drone strikes in Yemen may have been Obama's authorization in April 2012 of the ""signature"" strikes that had been approved the previous year for use in Pakistan's tribal regions. Such strikes do not target known militants but rather people who are displaying the behaviors of suspected militants. Such signature strikes were reportedly governed by stricter rules in Yemen than in Pakistan, though, and were given a different name: TADS, or Terrorist Attack Disruption Strikes. As of Monday, U.S. drone and air strikes have killed an estimated 753 to 965 people in Yemen, of whom the large majority were militants, but at least 81 were civilians, according to the New America Foundation study. All but six of the many hundreds of victims of the strikes were killed under the Obama administration. The drone program in Yemen began in earnest after a series of attempted terrorist attacks against the United States were traced back to al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. AQAP claimed responsibility for the would-be ""underwear bomb"" attack on a Detroit-bound flight by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab on Christmas Day 2009. Fortunately for the people on board Northwest Airlines Flight 253 that day, Abdulmutallab's bomb was a dud, and he succeeded only in burning himself rather than destroying a commercial airliner. Had his bomb exploded as intended, it would have been the most devastating terrorist attack on the United States since 9/11. Less than a year later, AQAP mailed two packages with bombs cleverly disguised inside HP LaserJet printer cartridges from a FedEx office and UPS facility in Yemen to the street addresses of two synagogues in Chicago. The toner in the printer cartridges had been replaced by the high explosive PETN. The bombs were almost impossible to detect as the explosives were odorless and the circuitry for the detonator looked like ordinary wiring. Both devices were discovered on October 29, 2010, before they could detonate, one in Dubai and the other at a British airport. They were discovered because of very specific information about the tracking numbers of both packages that was provided by the Saudis, who had managed to plant a spy in the ranks of AQAP. The bomb-maker believed responsible for these cleverly designed bombs is Ibrahim al-Asiri. According to a senior U.S. official, al-Asiri is proving hard to find, as he avoids any form of electronic communication and communicates only by courier. Another senior U.S. official says al-Asiri has been experimenting with bombs that can be implanted in suicide bombers using surgical techniques. Al-Asiri is the most important target in Yemen for U.S. intelligence, although senior American officials say he has also trained others in al Qaeda in advanced bomb-making, so his techniques may survive should he be killed in a drone strike. During the Obama administration, U.S. drones have killed 35 key al Qaeda militants in Yemen, including the Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who directed AQAP's operations against the United Sates before he was killed in 2011 drone strike. Unlike in Pakistan, where political leaders have condemned the strikes, Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi said during an interview with The Washington Post in 2012 that he personally signs off on all U.S. drone strikes in Yemen and that they hit their targets accurately, asserting, ""The drone technologically is more advanced than the human brain."" Yet some of the popular resentment toward the U.S. drone campaign that has long festered in Pakistan is beginning to emerge in Yemen. On April 23, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee held the first public hearing dedicated to the legal issues surrounding the U.S. drone campaign. One of the six who testified was Farea al-Muslimi, a young Yemeni activist who spent his high school years in the United States. Al-Muslimi told the committee that a drone strike had targeted his village of Wessab just six days earlier. ""What radicals had previously failed to achieve in my village,"" al-Muslimi told the senators, ""one drone strike accomplished in an instant: There is now an intense anger and growing hatred of America.""","Suspected U.S. drone strikes hit two different locations in Yemen .

"Palo Alto, California (CNN) -- Depending whom you ask, Chad Russell and Charles Butkus' invention is either a step forward for the Internet -- or a death knell for free content. Their AdTrap device intercepts online advertisements before they reach any devices that access your Internet connection, allowing you to surf the Web -- even stream videos -- without those annoying ads. Their inspiration? A conversation about the early days of the Internet. ""It was page, text and pictures -- and that's it,"" said Russell, 31. In other words, there were zero ads. So, Russell and Butkus set out to recreate the past and they came up with AdTrap. The company's motto is, ""The Internet is yours again."" While there are countless software and browser plug-ins that block online advertisements -- many of them free -- they are limited to the individual device or the specific browser. AdTrap, a white rectangular box that resembles a wireless router and costs $139, intercepts the ads before they reach the laptop, tablet or mobile phone. Interest and enthusiasm for Russell and Butkus' idea translated into $200,000, raised through a 30-day Kickstarter crowdsourcing campaign earlier this year. The funds are being used by parent company Bluepoint Security, a mobile antivirus software firm, to manufacture the AdTrap units. ""I think it speaks to the mindset of people right now of their experience on the Internet,"" Russell said. AdTrap devices started shipping in August, so it's still a little early to get a thorough review of the product. At the company's modest Palo Alto headquarters, I tested one of the units, which take only a few minutes to set up. Compared to the various software ad-blockers, Russell said a hardware solution is more effective because it works on every device connected to your network. The unit sits between the modem and router and it works reasonably well. It was nice to go to YouTube and other websites, click on a video and have it play instantly, ad free. There are a couple of sites like Hulu, for instance where AdTrap doesn't work, but Russell said they're working on some solutions. For many users, it's a huge victory over those annoying advertisements that sometimes follow you around the Web or make you wait 30 seconds before you can watch a video.

"(CNN) -- Actress Angelina Jolie is missing the premiere of her own film Unbroken because she says she has been diagnosed with chickenpox. She made the announcement in a video in which pink spots were visible on her face, neck and upper body. ""I just wanted to be clear and honest about why I will be missing the 'Unbroken' events in the next few days, which is that I found out last night that I have chickenpox. So, I will be home itching and missing everyone. And I can't believe it 'cause this film means so much to me,"" she says in the video published to Universal Studios Entertainment's verified Facebook page on Friday. Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease. It is caused by the varicella zoster virus. Babies who don't get vaccine still benefit . The virus causes an itchy blister-like rash that can be dangerous, particularly for people who get it late in life. It is an airborne virus, so that means it can spread by breathing in the virus particles that come from the chicken pox blisters. Chickenpox has become more rare since so many children have been vaccinated for it. The vaccine first became available in 1995. Prior to availability of the vaccine, about 4 million people would catch it each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 100 to 150 died each year. More than half of those deaths involved adults. For adults who get chickenpox, there can be more serious complications like pneumonia. It can also be more severe for infants who get it. For most people, especially for otherwise healthy children, it is a mild disease. Other symptoms include a loss of appetite, headache, tiredness and fever. Angelina Jolie fascinating photograph . If you've been vaccinated for it you should be immune. Typically, children get a first round of the vaccine when they are 12 to 15 months old. They get a second dose between the age of 4 and 6. If you've had chickenpox before, you should have immunity for life. If you haven't had it, and you haven't been vaccinated, it is not too late. The CDC suggests even as an adult you should talk to your doctor about getting the vaccine.","Actress Angelina Jolie will miss her premiere due to a case of the chickenpox .

"(CNN) -- A new timeline emerged in the emergency response to comedian Joan Rivers' cardiac arrest. She stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating during treatment at Yorkville Endoscopy. A New York City official with knowledge of the emergency response told CNN that on August 28 at: . 9:40 a.m: A 911 call from the Yorkville Clinic reports a patient in cardiac arrest. The incident is given the highest priority code. 9:45 a.m: The New York Fire Department response team arrives at the clinic and finds CPR efforts on Rivers already under way with the defibrillator attached and a breathing tube inserted into her windpipe. The firefighters take over the CPR efforts. 9:47 am: An ambulance from Mount Sinai Hospital arrives at the clinic. The ambulance team joins in the CPR efforts. 9:48 am: A second NYFD unit with Emergency Medical Technicians, along with a supervisor, arrive at the clinic. 9:50 am: A total of 10 rescue workers are on the scene. Rivers, 81 was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital, where she died a week later. Yorkville Endoscopy said in a statement this week that Dr. Lawrence Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures ... nor is he currently serving as medical director."" The statement did not say that his departure was connected to Rivers' death and clinic spokeswoman Marcia Horowitz declined to elaborate. In a statement, the Manhattan clinic said that the cardiac arrest did not happen during her elective procedure, and, responding to reports of a biopsy, said: ""A biopsy of the vocal cords has never been performed at Yorkville Endoscopy."" Many questions have been raised about what treatment was given and what might have gone wrongÂ that led to the comedian's death. Few answers have been made public because of medical privacy rules, but the New York State Health Department confirmed the agency is investigating. The clinic statement also seemed to address speculation that her cardiac arrest could have been related to the anesthesia used to sedate Rivers while an endoscope, which is a long, flexible camera, was used to examine her throat. ""General anesthesia has never been administered at Yorkville Endoscopy,"" the statement said. ""The type of sedation used at Yorkville Endoscopy is monitored anesthesia care. Our anesthesiologists utilize light to moderate sedation."" Clinic: Vocal-cord biopsy did not kill Joan Rivers . Only licensed medical doctors who are board-certified anesthesiologists administer anesthesia at the clinic, the statement said. ""Our anesthesiologists monitor the patient continuously utilizing state-of-the-art monitoring equipment, and remain at the bedside throughout the procedure and into recovery,"" it said. The clinic statement also deflected criticism that Rivers should have been treated in a hospital and not a clinic because of her advanced age. ""Yorkville Endoscopy has strict policies in place for the criteria of who gets treated in this center versus in a hospital,"" the statement said. ""Every patient is pre-screened by their gastroenterologist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse for appropriateness to be treated at Yorkville Endoscopy. Some patients are also pre-screened by their personal physicians."" Clinic where Joan Rivers stopped breathing is under investigation . CNN's Alan Duke and Doug Ganley contributed to this report.","New York firefighters responded to 911 call from clinic where Joan Rivers was treated .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officer was behind bars Monday after being arrested for allegedly helping drug traffickers move their product into the United States. The arrest of Jose Luis Zavala, 38, a CBP officer in Brownsville, Texas, follows an investigation by Homeland Security Investigations and Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, the CBP said. Zavala has been with the CBP for seven years and is now on administrative leave, the agency said. According to a criminal complaint, Zavala came to the attention of investigators on November 19, when a van carrying about 3,000 pounds of marijuana tried to enter the United States at the Gateway International Bridge in Brownsville. The 2004 Ford cargo van pulled up into the lane where Zavala was inspecting vehicles, the complaint states, but the van was only inspected after it was selected for a random screening. Inside the van were the 3,000 pounds of marijuana, which, the complaint states ""was not hidden in a compartment or disguised to appear as legitimate cargo."" The random inspection was a decision Zavala could not control. When asked about what happened, Zavala told fellow agents that the driver had a valid ID, and that the driver escaped back to Mexico on foot after being told of the random inspection, the criminal complaint states. Investigators learned that the ID did not belong to the driver, but to another person who agents interviewed on November 22, according to the complaint. This person, now a confidential source for the government, told investigators that he sold his ID to a drug trafficking organization, and that the group was aided by a U.S. agent, the document states. The interview led to the identification of Zavala as the U.S. agent that the source knew as ""Pepe,"" according to the document. The source identified Zavala in a photo, and his description of Zavala's vehicle matched the truck the agent drives, the complaint says. Among the evidence collected by investigators were some text messages sent to ""Pepe"" by the source, with what investigators say was code for when and where to cross. Zavala is facing drug smuggling and corruption charges. ""We do not tolerate corruption or abuse within our ranks, and we fully cooperate with any criminal or administrative investigation of alleged misconduct by any of our personnel, on or off duty,"" CBP said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Order has been restored in South Sudan after fighting that left about 500 people dead, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday. Government forces are now in charge of the situation, and flights have resumed at Juba International Airport, the ministry said. The United Nations, however, is warning that the crisis is not over. Joseph Contreras, U.N. acting spokesman on South Sudan, said, ""It is a very, very fluid situation, so I don't think the country is out of the woods yet."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also spoke Tuesday of being ""deeply concerned"" about South Sudan. ""There is a risk of this violence spreading to other states, and we have already seen some signs of this,"" Ban said. Meanwhile, the South Sudanese government said its forces are in ""absolute control of the situation"" and that Sunday's coup attempt was not based on ethnic divisions but rather on ""the power ambitions"" of the coup plotters. About 800 more people have been wounded in the violence, Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth said earlier. He said bodies are still being found in forests and many of those who were wounded are dying in hospitals. Deadly clashes in Africa's newest nation began Sunday evening. President Salva Kiir later said his forces had halted a coup attempt. U.N. officials have expressed deep concern about the unrest, saying between 15,000 and 20,000 people have taken shelter in the organization's compounds in the capital, Juba. ""There are many, many people who have run away, and there are also people who have been killed,"" one woman who fled the fighting said. ""Now there is a woman who has a baby who was shot in the back and died."" In Bor, a town 87 miles north of Juba, the South Sudan Red Cross reported 19 civilians were killed, said U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky. Meanwhile, about 800 people gathered at a U.N. camp in Bor to seek protection, he added. Gunfire was still ringing out in Juba as recently as Tuesday. But Makuei said Wednesday the situation in the city had returned to normal, with people returning to work, flights resuming and government offices opening. He said the rebels who have clashed with government forces had moved closer to the Nile River. Fears of ethnic tensions . U.N. officials have said they are worried the recent fighting is based on ethnic divisions. Makuei disputed that suggestion, saying people from different states and tribes rose up against the government, which is now fighting back. In a televised address Monday, Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his sacked deputy, Riek Machar, for starting the fighting Sunday evening. Ten people were arrested in connection with the foiled coup and five others are still at large, according to a statement posted Tuesday on the South Sudan government website. Those five include Machar, the government said on its Twitter account. U.N. leader Ban spoke with Kiir by phone Tuesday, expressing his concern about the fighting. ""I spoke to President Salva Kiir yesterday morning, urging him to do everything possible he can to end the violence and to ensure respect for human rights and the rule of law,"" Ban told reporters in New York on Wednesday. ""I also impressed on him the need to resume dialogue with the political opposition. I welcome the reports this morning that President Salva Kiir is willing to enter into such talks."" He urged ""all parties to cease hostilities immediately"" and called on the government to ""exercise restraint in the management of the situation and to guarantee the protection of all civilians regardless of their ethnicities,"" the United Nations said. Medical crisis . The International Committee of the Red Cross has said it is providing Juba's two major hospitals with support, such as wound-dressing materials, to cope with the heavy influx of patients. More than 300 people have been admitted to Juba Teaching Hospital and Juba Military Hospital over the past two days, the organization said Tuesday. ""We know there are more people who need care, but they are having difficulty reaching health care facilities because of the security situation and the lack of available transportation,"" Felicity Gapes, a Red Cross delegate leading the medical response on the ground, said in a prepared statement. The State Department said U.S. citizens in South Sudan should leave immediately and ordered the departure of nonemergency U.S. government personnel from the country. In a tweet, the U.S. Mission in Juba said an evacuation flight for Wednesday was full. With a dusk-to-dawn curfew in effect, it said the airport would close at 5.30 p.m. locally. Britain's Foreign Office announced the temporary withdrawal of some embassy staff and dependents. Kiir's dismissal of his Cabinet in July further inflamed deep tensions between his Dinka community and Machar's Nuer community. South Sudan formally split from Sudan in 2011 after a referendum, following decades of conflict. Numerous armed groups remain active in the oil-rich country. Britain's minister for Africa, Mark Simmonds, urged leaders on all sides to end hostilities and for civilians to be protected. ""After years of conflict, the people of South Sudan expect their leaders to resolve their differences through political, instead of military, means,"" he said in a prepared statement. ""Unless there is restraint from all sides it will be impossible to move the country further towards true national reconciliation.""

"(CNN) -- The death toll from violence in South Sudan is ""heavy,"" the United Nations said Tuesday, and thousands of people have sought refuge in the organization's compounds in Juba. Gunfire rang out again in the capital of in Africa's newest nation just hours after the country's President said his forces had halted a coup attempt. Clashes, which began on Sunday evening, have left hundreds in urgent need of medical care, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. Gerard Araud, the French representative to the United Nations and the current President of the Security Council, said precise figures on the death toll weren't available. ""But it's heavy,"" he said. ""It's dozens and dozens, scores of casualties, it's really not a minor incident."" Officials at the United Nations are ""extremely concerned"" about the violence, Araud said, due to the high number of casualties and because the fighting appears to be between different ethnic groups in South Sudan. On Tuesday, sporadic gunshots were heard in the area of Tonping, the U.S. Embassy said on its Twitter feed, quoting U.N. radio. It recommended that U.S. citizens currently in the country depart immediately. Women and children carrying bags, kettles, pots and basic belongings arriving at a U.N compound to seek shelter could be seen in pictures posted on the U.N. mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) Facebook page. Araud said Tuesday evening that around 15,000 to 20,000 civilians were taking refuge in the two UNMISS compounds in Juba, putting a strain on supplies of medicine, food, water and security resources. In a televised address Monday, South Sudan President Salva Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his sacked deputy Riek Machar for starting the fighting Sunday evening. Dressed in fatigues, he said the government was in full control of the capital and announced a nighttime curfew.

""At a time when unity among South Sudanese is more needed than ever, I call on the leaders of this new country and all political factions and parties, as well as community leaders to refrain from any action that fuels ethnic tensions and exacerbates violence,"" Johnson said. Juba's international airport remained closed. And with phone networks sketchy, embassies were turning to social media to stay in touch with their citizens, mainly calling on them to stay home and avoid unnecessary movement. The State Department said U.S. citizens currently in South Sudan should leave immediately, and it ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel from the country. ""The Embassy is also suspending normal operations until further notice and cannot provide routine consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan,"" it said.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Thursday he is sending up to 300 military advisers to Iraq, and could down the road authorize targeted military action, if necessary. Advisers will help train and support Iraqi forces, while gathering intelligence on the militant group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, which has taken several cities in the north and west of Iraq. Obama said such action was necessary to help prevent a civil war in Iraq that could destabilize the region, and also prevent creation of a terrorist safe haven. One aircraft carrier and five warships are already positioned in the Persian Gulf, U.S. drones are flying intelligence missions over Iraq and military sources tell CNN a list of ISIS targets has been compiled. Special forces teams will arrive in Iraq soon. They could ultimately assist in calling in airstrikes, if they are authorized. ""Going forward, we will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it,"" Obama said on Thursday. Without deploying combat troops -- which Obama has ruled out -- how could the United States take further military action? Airstrikes: Air power is the most talked about option to target ISIS fighters who have seized cities in northwestern Iraq and could advance into Baghdad. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf, which could facilitate an emergency evacuation of U.S. personnel in Iraq, would also enable missile strikes or bombing. Striking from the air could hamper the movement of ISIS fighters, said Karl Mueller, associate director of the Strategy, Doctrine, and Resources program at RAND Arroyo Center. Airstrikes would ""help stem the advancing tide of ISIS, mainly by striking their forces advancing toward Baghdad or other cities not already under their control,"" he said. Targeted strikes could help shift the momentum from ISIS fighters to Iraqi soldiers and could be highly effective and low risk, Mueller said. As during the 2011 intervention in Libya, ground forces are unlikely to pose a significant threat to U.S. air power and ISIS's air defenses ""would likely be even weaker,"" Mueller said. American bombing would not only give Iraqi forces the upper hand against ISIS, but could provide a much-needed ""psychological boost"" to Iraqi forces after soldiers abandoned their posts in Mosul, which was quickly captured by ISIS. Another benefit? U.S. airstrikes would be achievable without deploying U.S. military personnel near the ground targets, CNN military analyst retired Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks said. While some have raised concerns that an air campaign could result in a high number of civilian casualties, Marks called ISIS a ""very conventional force,"" boasting armored vehicles, artillery and ammo stockpiles. Precision strikes would be difficult to call in without forces on the ground, but the advisers Obama is now deploying could fulfill that task, CNN military analyst Rick Francona said. U.S. special forces would be ""in a great position to call in any air strikes,"" Francona said. Retired Army Gen. Mark Kimmitt called airstrikes ""one of the best guarantees"" to keep Iraq in one piece, but argued that ISIS is more focused on consolidating their gains and may not be interested in pushing into Baghdad. ""It's highly unlikely that they have either the manpower or the capability -- or quite frankly the desire -- to go well south into the southern, predominantly almost exclusively Shia areas,"" Kimmitt said. Drones: What if Obama decides he doesn't want U.S. pilots flying over Iraq at all? Drones have already been at the forefront of the U.S.'s fight against terrorism in the Middle East and perhaps the most recognizable weapon of the Obama administration's policy in countries like Yemen and Pakistan. But drones are best used to strike small, specific targets like vehicles and individual suspected terrorists and several military officials have told CNN that drone strikes would have a limited impact on a force like ISIS. Drones would help U.S. military officials fill the intelligence gap they need to seal in order to strike ISIS precisely, effectively and with limited civilian casualties. Experts and critics have cited the lack of updated military intelligence in ISIS-controlled areas as a hindrance to identifying specific targets. And the Pentagon has ramped up drone surveillance over northern and western Iraq since ISIS took several cities. But some say that is not enough. On the ground, intelligence-gathering: Obama has ruled out sending troops ""back into combat."" Plans for advisers are similar to those that retired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, the former head of Central Command, called for Monday on CNN. ""They can provide some of that ground intelligence ... that we're lacking,"" he said. ""They also can control airstrikes if necessary. They can function as advisers."" Zinni suggested the elite forces could work with Iraqi forces as well as with Kurdish fighters who recently seized control of the northern, oil-rich city of Kirkuk and are also battling the Islamist militants. Gen. Mark Hertling also called intelligence-gathering essential to distinguish between ISIS fighters and civilians. ""Intelligence is the driver. You can't drop bombs or hit targets without intelligence,"" Hertling said. ""In order to get intel, especially in a nation that's like Iraq, you have to have people seeking that intel on the ground. It just can't come from satellite photos, or an airplane moving at 200 knots above a target and say: 'Hey, that's good enough, let's drop a bomb.'"" To those urging Obama to take swift military action to strike ISIS, Hertling has a message: easier said than done. He urged caution, warning that without more intelligence, U.S. strikes could hit civilians. ""And as soon as the first bomb or the first strafing run hits a school bus or a car full of civilians, then the Americans are to blame for that,"" he said. But sending advisers could just be a first step to a larger U.S. mission in Iraq, experts warned. ""This is the first step. This is how you get drawn into these situations,"" Francona, a CNN military analyst, said. Cooperating with Iran: Obama also said that Iran can play a constructive role in Iraq if it is not ""coming in solely as an armed force on behalf of the Shia."" Iran deployed about 500 Revolutionary Guard troops to help the Iraqi government. But Iran's growing influence in Iraq continues to worry experts and U.S. officials as Iran's involvement risks further inflaming sectarian tensions already at a boiling point in the region. As Iranian planes fly through Iraq to arm the Syrian regime and as the war in Syria swells into neighboring countries, experts are warning of a possible regional war between Sunnis and Shiites. To keep Iraq from breaking into pieces, Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States would consider communicating with Iran to kill the advance of ISIS militants. Kerry is heading to Iraq for consultations on the situation there. ""We're open to discussions if there's something constructive that can be contributed by Iran,"" he said in an interview with Yahoo News, responding to a question about cooperating with the Iranian military. ""I think we need to go step by step and see what, in fact, might be a reality."" Kerry clarified Thursday that the United States is only ""interested in communicating with Iran"" and sharing information to prevent mistakes. But the powder-keg situation in Iraq has convinced even one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate to consider working with Iran. ""The Iranians can provide some assets to make sure Baghdad doesn't fall,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said. Meghan O'Sullivan, a former deputy national security adviser, agreed that a coordinated effort in Iraq between the U.S. and Iran might benefit both sides. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told Congress coordination with Iran would not be a first as the United States had previously ""worked with the Iranians on that western border in Afghanistan."" Others worried that a collaboration with Iran could further alienate Sunni Iraqis who are already weary of the Iraqi government or Iran's regional rivals. House Speaker John Boehner said the U.S. should rule out any partnership with Iran. ""I can just imagine what our friends in the region, our allies will be thinking by reaching out to Iran at a time when they continue to pay for terrorists and foster terrorism not only in Syria, in Lebanon but in Israel as well,"" Boehner said.

"(CNN) -- The Idaho man who slapped a crying 19-month-old boy on a Delta flight in February was sentenced Monday to eight months in prison, the man's lawyer said. Joe Rickey Hundley pleaded guilty to assault in federal court in October. Hundley's attorney, Marcia Shein, said Hundley will report to a yet-to-be determined prison but didn't say what the date would be. She said she respects the judge's ruling but called the sentence ""disproportionate"" to the crime and added that it was two months longer than what prosecutors had recommended. In February, Hundley was seated next to Jessica Bennett and her 19-month-old son in row 28 when Delta flight 721 from Minneapolis, Minnestoa, began its descent into Atlanta . When the baby began to cry, Hundley allegedly told Bennett to ""shut that (N-word) baby up,"" according to an FBI affidavit. ""(He) then turned around and slapped (the child) in the face with an open hand, which caused (him) to scream even louder,"" the affidavit continued. The boy suffered a scratch below his right eye. Shein said in a February statement that her client was in distress and grieving during the flight after learning the day before that his son was in a coma, after overdosing on insulin. Hundley was headed to Atlanta to decide whether or not to take his son -- who died the day after the flight -- off life support. Shein said Hundley ""had paid a terrible price for his hurtful words but asks only that people understand that he was not doing well that night and spoke hurtful words he would have not otherwise have said.""

"Liquid calories are not as satisfying as solid food and they generally lack any nutritional value. 75 percent of U.S. adults are projected to be overweight or obese by 2015, according to researchers. Americans consume anywhere from 150 to 300 more calories than they did three decades ago and half of those calories come from liquid. A new study out of John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health finds that reducing liquid calories, especially from sugar-sweetened drinks such as punches, fruit juices and sodas, helps people lose weight and keep it off. Question: Why the emphasis on liquid calories? Americans consume more liquid calories now than they ever have before. But unlike calories from solid food, it's much harder for people to track how many calories they consume from drinking. The human body's systems for regulating hunger and food intake are complex. But scientists do know that the lack of physiological and environmental cues associated with drinking, like not having to chew or prepare a drink like you prepare a meal, play a role. For these reasons, liquid calories don't keep a person full and they are not as satisfying as solid food. They are usually ""empty calories"" as well because they generally lack any nutritional value.  Watch more on the dangers of sweetened drinks » . Question: Are healthy drinks like smoothies and teas a better option when trying to lose weight? Not really. As one dietitian CNN spoke to phrased it, ""A calorie is a calorie is a calorie, no matter where it comes from."" Many of the ""healthy"" drinks on the market today are loaded with sugar and various sweeteners. Drinking a 16-ounce fruit smoothie may seem like a healthy choice but it could have almost 300 calories in it that you might not account for somewhere else in your diet. Teas, fruit juices, shakes and fortified waters are all great examples of seemingly healthy drinks that can be loaded with calories.","75 percent of U.S. adults are projected to be overweight or obese by 2015 .
Americans consume 150 to 300 more calories a day than 30 years ago .
Liquid calories are hard to keep track of, aren't as filling as regular food .
Cutting out 150 calories every day could save you from gaining 15 pounds a year .
Bottom Line: Reducing liquid calorie intake, especially of sugar-sweetened drinks, leads to greater weight loss success."
"(CNN) -- Japan is set to go ahead with some of its whaling activities even though a recent international court ruling ordered the country to end its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.'s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last month the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling. The Japanese fisheries ministry announced last week it would still proceed with a smaller research program in the northwest Pacific. The mission's departure, originally scheduled for April 22, was postponed until after a state visit by U.S. President Barack Obama, according to local media reports. The whaling fleet is now expected to leave Japan's shore on Saturday. Japan is also making preparations for a new proposal which could see its whaling fleet return to the Antarctic as early as next year, the ministry said. Both announcements by the ministry sparked renewed anger among environmentalists, who say Japan's research program is a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent a ban on the commercial whale meat trade. The head of Greenpeace Japan, Junichi Sato, said the fisheries ministry's latest announcement was a ""huge disappointment"" that flew in the face of the U.N. court's ruling and threatened to ""damage Japan's international standing."" Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's founder Captain Paul Watson was skeptical the revised plan reflected a sincere attempt by Japan to ensure the whale hunt produced valuable research. ""If they do it as a genuine scientific program they won't be able to kill very many whales and it wouldn't be worthwhile for them to go down there (to the Antarctic),"" he said. Although few people in Japan regularly eat whale meat, many support the controversial whaling research program. A survey, released by the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun earlier this week, found that 60% of respondents thought the research whaling should continue, while around 23% said the practice should stop. Almost half of those who thought the research should continue said they didn't eat whale meat. Only 4% said they consumed whale meat ""occasionally"" while 10% said they ate it on ""rare occasions,"" according to Asahi Shimbun. Japan's Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said the catch from the upcoming Pacific mission would be reduced from 380 whales to 210 and nonlethal methods for carrying out the research would be explored, according to a statement released by the ministry last week. In a separate statement, fisheries minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said Japan would conduct research whaling ""based on international law and scientific evidence,"" while firmly maintaining its policy of ""aiming for the resumption of commercial whaling."" Tokyo is making preparations to submit a revised whaling plan for both the Pacific and the Antarctic to the International Whaling Commission by this fall, ahead of the 2015-16 season. He also said Japan would explore ways to deal with anti-whaling activists, who are often involved in scuffles with Japanese whaling vessels. The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling in 1986, but Japan has continued to carry out whale hunts by taking advantage of a loophole that permits the killing of mammals for scientific research, despite strong criticism from international anti-whaling campaigners and governments of countries that include the United States and Australia. The International Court of Justice ruled on March 31 that Japan can no longer continue its whale hunt in the Antarctic after the court failed to find evidence the program had legitimate research value. In the Asahi Shimbun poll, 40% of Japanese respondents said the court's decision was reasonable while almost as many, 39% said it was unreasonable.

"(CNN) -- A year ago, President Obama delivered a speech at the National Defense University in Washington in which he made the case that it was time to wind down the ""boundless global war on terror "" and ""perpetual wartime footing"" that has been a feature of American life since 9/11. Indeed, the CIA drone program in Pakistan has stopped completely since the beginning of this year. This is a noteworthy development given the fact that there have been 370 drone strikes in Pakistan over the past decade that have killed somewhere between 2,080 to 3,428 people; most of whom were suspected militants, but also a smaller number of civilians. In his speech the President made the case that al Qaeda, which carried out the 9/11 attacks, ""is on the path to defeat. Their remaining operatives spend more time thinking about their own safety than plotting against us."" Obama outlined the remaining terrorism threat as coming from ""less capable al Qaeda affiliates"" who are certainly threats to American diplomatic facilities and businesses abroad, as well from ""homegrown extremists,"" like those who bombed the Boston Marathon a little over a year ago. Such homegrown extremists remain capable of carrying out attacks on the scale of the Boston bombings, but such incidents are tragedies rather than national catastrophes, as 9/11 was. In the President's view these kinds of threats do not necessitate that the country remain on an endless war footing. And, indeed, it is long past time for the United States to transition away from a state of perpetual war now that the threat from al Qaeda to American national security has diminished significantly both because of al Qaeda's own weaknesses and the many defensive measures the United States has taken since 9/11. To transition away from a war footing, Obama said he would make changes in three key areas: . First by reforming the secret CIA drone program. The President promised that going forward, ""There must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured"" for strikes to be authorized. Second, he said he would move to repeal the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) that was passed by Congress just days after the 9/11 attacks. The AUMF authorized not only America's longest war in Afghanistan, but also U.S. operations against al Qaeda and its allies in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. Third, Obama said he would hasten the closing of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay. So what has changed in the twelve months since Obama gave that speech? The cessation of drone strikes in Pakistan since the beginning of the year is due to a combination of the President pushing for a more calibrated use of drone strikes; running out of ""high value"" al Qaeda and Taliban targets in Pakistan's tribal areas; very strong pushback from the Pakistani public and government who are opposed to the drone strikes on the grounds that they violate Pakistan's national sovereignty; and the fact that the Pakistani government is stepping up its own military operations against militants in the Pakistani tribal region of North Waziristan, where the majority of CIA drone strikes have taken place. Air strikes by the Pakistani air force, for instance, killed approximately 60 people on Wednesday in North Waziristan. In Pakistan, there have also been no reported civilian casualties from CIA drone strikes during the past year, according to data collected by the New America Foundation. In contrast, in Yemen, civilian casualties from U.S. drone strikes have remained steady over the past year. From May 2013 to May 2014, 16 civilians were killed in U.S. drone strikes, including a number of civilians in a mid-December strike that mistakenly targeted a wedding party because intelligence reports identified the vehicles as carrying al Qaeda operatives. There were also 16 civilians killed in drone strikes the previous year in Yemen. Bergen: Drones will fill the sky . On drones, it is clear that the President's directives to tighten up on the protocols for authorizing drone strikes have made some real differences in Pakistan both in terms of the falling numbers of civilian casualties and the cessation of drone strikes there. But in Yemen, while the number of civilian casualties has remained constant, the number of drone strikes is actually declining. Since the president's speech, there have been 29 drone strikes in Yemen. There were 36 strikes in the 12 months before. Last May, Obama also said he looked forward ""to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF's mandate."" Since it was this Authorization for the Use of Force that made possible the introduction of combat troops into Afghanistan 13 years ago, the natural moment to ultimately repeal the declaration is as the last of U.S. combat troops leave Afghanistan at the end of this year. For the moment, the administration hasn't taken up this effort, which could meet a good deal of opposition from some in the Republican party who would likely want to extend and even expand the authorization so that it could permit the use of U.S. military force against al Qaeda-aligned groups around the world. Opinion: When will drones stop killing innocent people in Yemen? And repealing the authorization would also raise some knotty national security and political issues given the present political paralysis and rancor in Congress. First, U.S. Special Operations raids against al-Qaeda members and allies in Libya and Somalia in 2013 were conducted under the AUMF. How does one get congressional buy-in for a more narrow legal framework that might constrain such raids? Second, since the drone program draws its legal validity partly from the AUMF, how would that declaration's expiration affect the use of drones in countries such as Pakistan? Third, what should the United States do about the 40 or so prisoners at Guantanamo Bay who are deemed ""too dangerous to release,"" but are not chargeable with a crime, and who would theoretically have to be released if the present authorization for the use of force expired? Without that authorization it would not be possible to treat Guantanamo detainees as prisoners of war since the war would be effectively over. President Obama also promised to wind down the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay (GTMO). Since that speech, there have been a number of prisoners released from Guantanamo, including two Algerian prisoners who were transferred to Algeria in August, and three Chinese Uighur prisoners captured in Afghanistan who were transferred to Slovakia in December. A recent agreement with Uruguayan President JosÃ© Monica would allow a further six of the remaining 154 prisoners in Gitmo to be transferred to Uruguay. At the same time, the Obama administration has in the past year successfully put a number of high profile militants on trial in the Southern District of New York, such as bin Laden's son in law, Suleiman Abu Ghaith, and Abu Hamza, a London-based cleric who helped to direct the 1998 kidnapping of Western tourists in Yemen by al Qaeda-aligned militants. Despite much hand wringing by politicians about trying prominent terrorists in the United States, those trials, which have taken place a few blocks from the newly rebuilt World Trade Center, have proceeded without incident and juries have speedily convicted the terrorists on all counts. Given the speed and efficacy of these trials, perhaps it's time for the Obama administration to abandon the military tribunal process at Guantanamo altogether and bring 9/11 operational planner Khalid Sheik Mohammed (KSM) to trial in Manhattan. Such a plan was scuppered three years ago, in part, because of opposition from politicians in New York who claimed it was a public safety risk to hold KSM's trial in Manhattan. These concerns seemed overwrought even at the time and are effectively moot at this point. KSM has spent the past eleven years in American captivity but still he has not been put on trial because he is tangled in the cumbersome and largely untested military tribunal process in Guantanamo. To summarize: Since the President's speech arguing for ending America's endless war on terror, there has been a marked change in the CIA's drone program in Pakistan, which has effectively ended. Yet there has been little real change in the similar drone program in Yemen. Meanwhile, there has been incremental progress on emptying the prison camp at Guantanamo and real progress on using the ordinary civilian court system to convict prominent terrorists. As yet there is no serious discussion in Congress or by the White House about what, if anything, might happen to the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). Given the political realities in Washington, our guess is the AUMF will simply remain in place indefinitely because any effort to replace it or end it will encounter resistance in Congress.","A year ago, President Obama gave a key speech on the ""boundless...war on terror""

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors say he may be a criminal. People who say they know him describe him as a great dad. So what's the story with Justin Ross Harris, the Cobb County, Georgia, man accused of murder after leaving his toddler strapped into his car seat under a blistering Southern sun? The truth is, we don't know much. Police and prosecutors are being tight-lipped about the case against Harris, who is charged with felony murder and second-degree child cruelty in the death of 22-month-old Cooper Harris. He's refusing visitors to the Cobb County jail -- including CNN. His family isn't talking, and his attorney has not returned repeated telephone calls from CNN. Here's what we do know: . Harris is 33 years old. He has worked at Home Depot for two years. Home Depot Corporate Communications Manager Catherine H. Woodling said he worked ""on our .com business, but I'm not sure what his title is."" He was placed on unpaid leave after the charges were filed in the June 18 incident -- a routine action in such situations, Woodling said. He held jobs at the University of Alabama from August 2001 until May 2006 as a parking monitor and later as a mail delivery clerk, said Cathy Andreen, university director of media relations. He worked as a police dispatcher in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, from June 10, 2006, to May 22, 2009, according to Police Department spokesman Sgt. Brent Blankley. He said the department would confirm only Harris' tenure, and not any details from his work history, so we don't know why he left the job. In May 2012, Harris graduated from the University of Alabama with a bachelor's degree in commerce and business administration, having majored in management information systems, Andreen said. The boy's mother, Leanna Harris, is listed as having the same home address as the father, but she told CNN last week that she's been advised not to discuss the case with the media. They were married May 7, 2006, in Tuscaloosa, according to the Tuscaloosa County marriage license clerk. A woman who knew Harris as a teenager but hasn't seen him in 15 years described him as ""a good kid"" who spent a lot of time at University Church of Christ in Tuscaloosa, where Cooper is to be remembered at a funeral Saturday. ""We were always happy to have him in our home. And we were happy that he was friends with our child,"" Carol Brown told CNN's Nick Valencia. People who say they know Harris posted change.org petitions asking that the charges against him be dropped but closed the petitions this week. One of the organizers posted, ""based on the recent developments this petition is no longer revelant."" CNN couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the petition comments, many of which speak glowingly of Harris as a man and a father. One petition signer, identified as Matt Wiley of Northpoint, Alabama, described Harris as ""a great husband and a great father."" Another, identified as Michael Gordon of Northpoint, wrote of what he said was Harris' ""grace and exemplary attitude."" ""He has been nothing but a caring father and supporting husband. He worked full time and went to school for many years to get where he wanted to be,"" he said. A petition signer identified as William Overstreet wrote that he couldn't imagine that man he says he knows intentionally killed his child. ""I've known Ross for over 10 years and he is a selfless man who loved people and loved his family more,"" the post reads. ""NOTHING in his life even hints at this behavior."" CNN's Devon Sayers and Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report.","Little has emerged about father of 22-month-old boy who died in car .

"(CNN) -- A Dutch court intervened Friday to stop a 13-year-old girl from attempting to sail around the world by herself, stripping her parents of sole custody. Laura Dekker will find out on Friday whether the Dutch Court will back her record attempt. Laura Dekker's parents support her round-the-world ambition, which sparked concern from child protection officials because of her age. They took the case to court to prevent the solo trip. On Friday the Dutch High Court in Utrecht ruled that the Child Protection Board will share custody over Laura with her parents for two months. The move prevents the parents from permitting Laura to set off on her trip alone, though Laura will remain at home with her father, Dick Dekker, a court official said. During those two months, a child psychologist will assess Laura's mental state and ability to carry out a solo round-the-world journey, a court official said. A guardian will be appointed to oversee the case until the court next meets Oct. 26. The court will then make a final ruling on whether her parents may have the final say about their daughter's plans, the court official said. Is the court right to block her bid? Have your say below . Laura's parents are happy about Friday's decision, family lawyer Peter de Lange said. He said the parents are especially pleased that the court didn't prevent Laura from making the journey, because they hope she can still proceed with her plans. The teenager was out sailing Friday, de Lange said. She is pleased with the decision and hopes she can still make a solo trip, he said. Laura believes she will be able to convince the court that she is fit to make the trip alone, de Lange said. Social workers took the action to stop the teen from attempting to become the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe because they believe the voyage would be too dangerous. Laura said she has dreamed of sailing around the world since she was 10 and her parents are determined to help her achieve her goal. She called the attention that has been heaped on her case ""a bit over the top."" Just this week, a British teenager became the youngest person to sail around the world solo when he returned to Britain after a nine-month trip. Guinness World Records confirmed the feat. Mike Perham, 17, had a support team sailing alongside him during the trip. He said he doesn't think age alone should determine whether Laura Dekker is ready for such an adventure. It's ""whether she's got the physical strength, the mental strength, or the technical ability,"" he said. ""Can she strip an engine blindfolded? Can she build boats? Is she an electrician? Is she a mechanic as well? You can't just be a sailor for a trip like this."" Another sailor, Robin Knox-Johnston, also said age shouldn't be the only determining factor. He was the first person to circumnavigate the globe alone without stopping -- in 1969, when he was 29. ""It's really more a question, is that person, that young person, mature enough to be able to look after themselves and deal with everything that's going to come at you when you get out alone at sea?"" he said. Gold medal-winning Olympic sailor Shirley Robertson insisted that sailing is an experience-based sport and that Laura may not be ready for such a great challenge. ""Mike Perham has four years on Laura. That's a big difference,"" she told CNN. ""Mike had already completed challenges such as sailing across the Atlantic before embarking on his ultimate quest. ""There's a world of difference between sailing a small craft on the Ijsselmeer and sailing around the world with all the challenges that presents."" Robertson also pointed out that ""we live in a culture of record-breaking and fame-seeking,"" with people constantly looking to be the youngest or quickest at anything. ""Why does she need to sail around the world on her own now? Why not sail with a parent first to gain more experience?"" CNN's Ashleigh Nghiem, Francesca Church and Paul Armstrong contributed to this story.","Laura Dekker, 13, wants to become youngest person to sail solo around globe .

"(CNN) -- A man climbed to the top of a nearly 60-story skyscraper in downtown San Francisco, California, on Monday, where he unfurled a U.S. flag and was promptly detained by police. Video from CNN affiliate KGO showed a man, dressed in red, scaling the side of a giant tower with what appeared to be suction cups. ""He made it to the top of the building and my understanding is that there were some officers waiting for him,"" said Albie Esparza, a spokesman for the San Francisco Police Department. He identified the climber as Daniel Goodwin, also known as the ""Skyscraper Man."" On his website, Goodwin said he planned to climb the Millennium Tower, a nearly 60-story building in San Francisco, to help raise awareness of cancer and the county's vulnerability to terrorist attacks on its skyscrapers. After unfurling an American flag at the top of the building, the climber turned himself over to police. Esparza said Goodwin was cited on two misdemeanor charges and released.","The man was detained by police at the top of a roughly 60-story skyscraper .

"(CNN) -- Bangladesh cricket chiefs have postponed Pakistan's seven-match tour of the country scheduled to start next week, following government advice. Bangladeshi Rifles soldiers report back to base following the mutiny that left more than 70 dead. The decision, announced on the Bangladesh Cricket Board's (BCB) Web site, comes two days after a terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan Test team in Pakistan city Lahore killed eight people and left as many injured. BCB's succinct statement on Thursday read: ""The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has postponed Pakistan's Tour of Bangladesh 2009 as advised by the Government authorities."" Pakistan were scheduled to play two Twenty20 internationals and five one-day internationals in Bangladesh, starting with a Twenty20 match in Dhaka on March 10. Officials of the Pakistan Cricket Board announced a 16-man squad for the tournament on Wednesday, but had also asked for government permission for the team to travel to Bangladesh. Bangladesh are also facing political turmoil following the mutiny of border security forces group Bangladesh Rifles in the capital that left more than 70 dead. Officials of the BCB had joined the worlwide cricket community in strongly condemning the attack on Sri Lanka's squad. They said: ""The BCB is deeply concerned at this unprecedented attack on cricket which is a symbol of hope and aspiration for millions in the Sub-continent and around the world. ""We are saddened by the unfortunate events and express solidarity with the players, match officials and victims of the attack. ""The BCB has been in touch with Sri Lanka Cricket, Pakistan Cricket Board and the International Cricket Council and has voiced its alarm at the incident."" Pakistan board chairman Ijaz Butt has urged International Cricket Council hierarchy to wait at least 12 months before considering whether or not to move 2011 World Cup games away from his country. ""It would be too unjust to doubt Pakistan's ability to host the 2011 World Cup in the wake of terrorists attack on the Sri Lankan team,"" PA Sport quoted Butt as saying. ""I have taken up the matter with the ICC and would also request the international cricket community not to make hasty decisions and wait for a year at least to judge Pakistan's credentials as a host of international matches. ""What happened on Tuesday came as shock to the PCB and the whole nation.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The end is coming for radio and TV icon Casey Kasem. He's suffering from dementia and bedsores, and his body is shutting down at a hospital in Washington state, court documents say. On Wednesday, a Los Angeles County judge gave daughter Kerri Kasem the authority to have doctors end his infusions of water, food and medicine. The ruling reinstates the 82-year-old's end-of-life health directive. Kasem's doctor concluded that continuing the artificial nutrition and hydration would only ""at best prolong the dying process for him and will certainly add suffering to an already terribly uncomfortable dying process,"" said Kerri Kasem's lawyer, Troy Martin. ""The court's decision today upheld our father's explicit wishes as expressed by him in his health directive,"" Kerri Kasem said in a statement after the hearing. She was referring to a directive her father signed in 2007, saying he would not want to be kept alive if it ""would result in a mere biological existence, devoid of cognitive function, with no reasonable hope for normal functioning."" Steve Haney, an attorney for Kasem's second wife, Jean, slammed the judge's decision, calling it ""the functional equivalent of a death sentence."" ""Nobody wants Mr. Kasem to die,"" Martin said. ""The fact is that he is dying from sepsis and dementia."" Casey Kasem's family feud . What's next? Now that Kerri Kasem can order doctors to withhold water, food and medicine from her father, will she? She has before. Over the weekend, infusions were stopped, but they were reinstated Monday after a request by Jean Kasem and under the order of Judge Daniel Murphy -- the same judge who reversed himself and restored the authority to Kerri Kasem on Wednesday. Judge orders Casey Kasem's water, food, medications restored . The family has made no announcement about his care. Family feud . The public battle over Casey Kasem -- which has always been emotional and sometimes bizarre -- began in October 2013, when daughters Julie and Kerri led a protest outside Kasem's Los Angeles mansion, holding signs demanding that their stepmother let them see their ailing father. Kerri Kasem told reporters that Jean Kasem had kept them away for the previous three months and that she was worried about her father's health. Kasem's family battling over ailing host . ""I don't get it, I don't understand it,"" she told CNN. ""He has Parkinson's, and all the research we've done indicates socialization would help him."" About a dozen people who said they were friends of Kasem joined the daughters in the sign-waving demonstration at the entrance to the Kasem estate. ""Let Casey see his kids,"" one sign read. His younger brother, Mouner Kasem, flew to Los Angeles from Michigan to hold a sign that read: ""I miss my brother."" ""He can't really speak, but he knows we're there,"" Kerri Kasem told a TV reporter covering the protest. ""And last time we saw him, he could shuffle a little bit. He had a hard, very hard, time walking. He was just deteriorating due to Parkinson's disease."" Kasem's kids take stepmom to court . Daughter Julie Kasem and her husband, a cardiologist, filed a petition in court days later asking a judge to give them control of Kasem's medical care. Los Angeles County Superior Judge Lesley Green appointed an investigator to report on Kasem's condition. The judge ruled in November that he was being well cared for by his wife and denied the daughter's request for a medical conservatorship. But that changed recently. Murphy temporarily expanded Kerri Kasem's powers over her ailing father at a May 24 hearing. The judge also said that the famed radio countdown host ""cannot travel anywhere without a court order and until the doctor examines him and gives him clearance for a journey,"" a court spokeswoman said. Earlier in the month, Jean Kasem moved her husband to Washington state from Southern California without notifying the rest of the family. Jean Kasem again faced off with her stepchildren in a Kitsap County court on May 30, a hearing that ended with Kerri Kasem getting a judge's approval to visit her father for an hour. The judge also gave Kerri Kasem authority to take him to a doctor. Reaching for the stars . The dispute is about love, Kerri and Julie Kasem said. Jean, his wife of 33 years, argued it's about Kasem's fortune, built over four decades of radio and television voice work. Kasem's voice counted down the ""American Top 40"" hits each week for nearly four decades in a radio show heard around the world. He voiced the cartoon character Shaggy on ""Scooby-Doo"" cartoons for 40 years. He was the voice of the NBC television network for years. He narrated thousands of radio and television commercials during his career. He divorced his first wife when his daughters and son were young. He was remarried in 1980 to Jean, a 26-year-old actress best known for a recurring role on TV's ""Cheers"" series. The couple have a daughter together, Liberty Kasem, now a 24-year-old aspiring singer. Kasem became the world's best-known radio host as his syndicated shows grew in popularity and distribution through the 1970s and 1980s. His famous signoff was ""Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars."" He finally handed off his duties to Ryan Seacrest in 2004. He retired from hosting and voice work in 2009, two years after a doctor diagnosed him with Parkinson's disease, a diagnosis that was later changed to Lewy body dementia, which has no cure, according to court documents. Planning for the end . After Kasem was told he had Parkinson's in 2007, he signed a document giving his oldest children authority to make his medical decisions if he should become unable to do so himself. The power of attorney statement signed by Kasem on November 11, 2007, included a declaration that he did not want to be kept alive with ""any form of life sustaining procedures, including nutrition and hydration"" if it ""would result in a mere biological existence, devoid of cognitive function, with no reasonable hope of normal functioning."" This document, which snubbed Kasem's wife, set the stage for the legal battle that would erupt six years later as his health deteriorated and his children accused their stepmother of shutting them out of their father's life. It would serve as a legal basis for his daughter to have doctors discontinue infusions of water, food and medicine. Judge finds wife taking good care of Kasem . Preparing to say goodbye . All of Kasem's children, his brother and his wife gathered at St. Anthony's Hospital on Friday, preparing to say goodbye. Kasem ""won't be with us much longer,"" said Danny Deraney, the rep for Kerri Kasem. Despite their bitter squabble, Kerri Kasem said the children from his first marriage wanted their stepmother and half-sister to be with them as it seemed his last moments were nearing. ""If he opens his eyes, I want my dad just once to see everyone standing around him, putting our differences aside and let him know how much he is loved by everyone, including Jean and Liberty,"" she said. ""For the last 11 days, our father has been surrounded day and night by love and care by his daughters Kerri and Julie, his son Mike, his brother Mouner and sister-in-law Mary, and his dear friend Gonzalo Venecia,"" Kerri's rep said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. ""We continue to hope that Jean and Liberty will come join his family during this time."" Kasem's children hope family will put aside dispute in his last moments .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Catherine Schmidt-Jones, or Kitty as she's known to her friends, is, in her words, ""an obscure music teacher in Champaign, Illinois."" Kitty Schmidt-Jones, whose Connexions modules have been viewed over 7 million times . But that's not strictly true: Schmidt-Jones is far from obscure. Through her online music courses, she has reached thousands of people and her teaching material has been viewed online -- over 7 million times. Schmidt-Jones is just one of a growing number of professors and teachers who are using the Web site Connexions (cnx.org) to reach potential students. And what's more, they're doing it for free. Connexions was set up by Rice University professor Richard Baraniuk in 1999. He wanted to produce learning materials for his electrical engineering students, but was frustrated by how expensive and slow it would be to produce a textbook. ""The access was going to be limited -- it would only be available to just a few students from the United States,"" he told CNN. ""In the developing world, it would basically not be available at all. ""And the production process is just incredibly slow. For example, to get Pluto out of all of our nation's textbooks will take a decade. By then, Pluto will be reinstated as a planet, so we'll have to put it back in."" So Baraniuk decided to do something different. At the time, he was learning about Linux software. It dawned on him that its open source concepts could be adapted for education. ""I realized that there was a better way that was enabled by information technology, where we could author textbooks as a community and make them free and open for people to use and reuse,"" he explained. On the Connexions Web site, authors can upload bite-sized chunks of learning materials called ""modules."" Modules can be strung together to form whole courses, or ""collections."" Anyone can build a collection from any combination of modules -- so, for example, a module on Shakespeare's Hamlet could appear in collections on literature, Elizabethan history or dramatic arts. This building-block approach means that courses can be adapted both for personal use and by teachers who can tailor each collection for a particular curriculum, class or even an individual student. To ensure the quality of its content, the site supports peer-review and endorsement of modules by third parties and all material is attributed to the author. And once a collection is assembled, a textbook version can be printed on demand through third-party Qoop for around $24 -- considerably less than the cost of most college textbooks, but still enough to pay the author a slice of the royalties. ""A lot of the back-end that's been handled by traditional publishers can be handled very efficiently by this new breed of information technology,"" Baraniuk explains. ""So we can lower the cost for everybody, sometimes to zero for materials that are online."" The Connexions formula is certainly working. Today, the site has nearly 5,000 modules written by university professors, school teachers and other educators, and while most are in the sciences (reflecting its roots) the arts and humanities are growing. The content attracts 600,000 users a month, ranging from K-12 children to university-level engineering students. Fifty percent of its traffic comes from outside the United States, with 30-40 percent coming from the developing world. And as the site grows, Baraniuk is seeing a rise in the number of people using its modules, especially in the arts and humanities, for informal learning. Even governments are starting to notice its potential. Connexions recently obtained an Official Memo of Understanding to supply Vietnam with course materials, with more partner countries in the pipeline. And Connexions is crossing language barriers, too. While most of the site's modules are in English, the site's volunteer translators help meet the demand for educational materials in other languages, where translation and production of traditional textbooks is often prohibitively expensive. ""My particular book in Connexions is fairly popular,"" Baraniuk explains, ""But I was translated by three volunteer engineering students in University of Texas, El Paso and my book is far more popular in Spanish than it is in English. ""That really gives you a sense of the global reach."" But perhaps its most striking benefit is the site's ability to connect talented educators who would not have considered going the traditional publishing route, like Catherine Schmidt-Jones, with people who want to learn but don't have access to books. Those authors are seizing the opportunity to pass on their knowledge. ""I don't think any publisher of music textbooks would even have looked at my material,"" Schmidt-Jones told CNN.

"(CNN) -- Conservative critics have launched an attack on CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, who moderated Tuesday's second presidential debate, after she corrected former Gov. Mitt Romney's claim that President Barack Obama did not refer to the consulate attack in Benghazi as an ""act of terror."" CNN Fact Check: A day after Libya attack, Obama described it as 'acts of terror' Obama said in the debate that on September 12, he called the attack in Libya that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, an ""act of terror."" Romney, however, disputed the claim, and said the president had not called it an ""act of terror"" for 14 days. Crowley correctly stated that Obama had used the term ""act of terror"" during remarks at The White House the day after the attack. Romney was mistaken. In an editorial on Wednesday titled ""Candy's not dandy,"" The New York Post -- owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., parent company of Fox News Channel -- repeated accusations against Crowley first leveled by Romney surrogate John Sununu on CNN's Early Start on Wednesday morning. ""The president was caught lying last night, and I think the world should know that,"" Sununu told CNN's Soledad O'Brien. Sununu contended that Obama's comments were in reference to ""the original 9/11 event"" and not the Libya attack. However, the transcripts of the debate and also the president's Rose Garden address, as well as subsequent comments, show that, in fact, Crowley was correct. Here was the entire exchange from the transcript of the debate: . CROWLEY: Because we're -- we're closing in, I want to still get a lot of people in. I want to ask you something, Mr. President, and then have the governor just quickly. Your secretary of state, as I'm sure you know, has said that she takes full responsibility for the attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi. Does the buck stop with your secretary of state as far as what went on here? OBAMA: Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job. But she works for me. I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do. The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened. That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime. And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families. And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our U.N. ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive. That's not what we do. That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as commander in chief. CROWLEY: Governor, if you want to... ROMNEY: Yes, I -- I... CROWLEY: ... quickly to this please. ROMNEY: I -- I think interesting the president just said something which -- which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror. OBAMA: That's what I said. ROMNEY: You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror. It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying? OBAMA: Please proceed governor. ROMNEY: I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror. OBAMA: Get the transcript. CROWLEY: It -- it -- it -- he did in fact, sir. So let me -- let me call it an act of terror... OBAMA: Can you say that a little louder, Candy? CROWLEY: He -- he did call it an act of terror. It did as well take -- it did as well take two weeks or so for the whole idea there being a riot out there about this tape to come out. You are correct about that. ROMNEY: This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction. CROWLEY: It did. ROMNEY: It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group. And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary -- . OBAMA: Candy? ROMNEY: Excuse me. The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how -- . OBAMA: Candy, I'm -- . ROMNEY: -- this was a spontaneous -- . CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me -- . OBAMA: I'm happy to have a longer conversation -- . CROWLEY: I know you -- . OBAMA: -- about foreign policy. CROWLEY: Absolutely. But I want to -- I want to move you on and also -- . OBAMA: OK. I'm happy to do that, too. CROWLEY: -- the transcripts and -- . OBAMA: I just want to make sure that -- . CROWLEY: -- figure out what we -- . OBAMA: -- all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered... And here is the transcript from Obama's Rose Garden remarks on September 12, the day after the attack: . ""Our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those both civilian and military who represent us around the globe,"" he said. ""No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done."" Obama repeated the ""acts of terror"" line during a campaign event in Las Vegas on September 13: . ""No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America."" Timeline: What the Obama administration has said about the Libya attack . In the debate, Crowley, who is anchor of CNN's ""State of the Union with Candy Crowley,"" also said that Romney was correct to say that it took the administration some time to say conclusively and with one voice that the attack was not the spontaneous outgrowth of a protest against an anti-Islam film. CROWLEY: He -- he did call it an act of terror. It did as well take -- it did as well take two weeks or so for the whole idea there being a riot out there about this tape to come out. You are correct about that. On September 16, Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said, ""We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned."" On September 19, Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that the ambassador and three other Americans ""were killed in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy."" But, as to the original accusation from the conservative critics that Obama never mentioned ""acts of terror"" until weeks after the attack, they were wrong. Crowley was right.

"(CNN) -- Cluster boxes. If you haven't heard of them yet, you will soon. They are about to change something basic about American life: the sight of the mail carrier strolling up to the front door to drop off that day's letters, magazines, bills and advertising fliers. Door-to-door mail delivery appears to be a luxury that the U.S. Postal Service no longer can afford. It's no secret that the Postal Service is in terrible financial trouble; last year the agency lost $16 billion. No business can afford to go on that way without making dramatic changes. As CNNMoney's Jennifer Liberto reported from Washington last week, the Postal Service has begun telling communities with new housing developments that mail carriers will not provide doorstep, or even curbside, delivery. Instead, cluster boxes -- groupings of mailboxes at a centralized point in the community -- will be constructed. Homeowners will be expected to leave their houses and go to the nearest cluster box to pick up their daily mail. And in Congress, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, is proposing that door-to-door delivery be done away with not just in new developments, but at existing homes, too. He believes the Postal Service could save $4 billion a year this way. It's hard to counter the argument that if something drastic isn't done, the Postal Service simply won't be able to operate much longer. With Americans relying more and more on e-mail and text messages, and with bills being routinely paid online, the Postal Service isn't bringing in enough revenue to justify the enormous costs of universal mail delivery. Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe has been pushing for the elimination of Saturday mail delivery, but congressional resistance made him put the plan on hold. Even though Donahoe says that Saturday delivery is no longer fiscally feasible, members of Congress are reluctant to anger their constituents -- both individuals and businesses -- by letting the plan go through. If the cluster boxes begin proliferating, though, and people are told that the mail carrier won't be appearing at their doors, you can expect widespread unhappiness and high-decibel frustration. It's not that people don't understand that the Postal Service is on the ropes. But to declare such a fundamental American tradition -- the arrival of the postal carrier at the front door -- past tense will not go unnoticed or uncontested. It's hardly wild speculation to predict that people will not relish having to go out into the weather every time they want to retrieve their mail. Some won't trust the security of the group mailboxes, no matter how many assurances they receive. They'll be especially vexed on rainy or snowy days when they make the trip to the cluster boxes, only to find that the carrier hasn't arrived yet. For those accustomed to door-to-door mail service, the act of picking up and sorting through the mail in front of other people may feel less private. Opinion: No more Saturday visits from Bob . Yet the really noteworthy thing is not what may be ending -- the noteworthy thing is what we have taken on faith for so long. If someone in government, today, were proposing to start the Postal Service from scratch, offering the amenities Americans are accustomed to, he'd be laughed out of the room. ""You're saying that this service of yours would be expected to send uniformed workers to every house and business in America?"" ""Yes."" ""How would the homeowners and business owners summon these couriers?"" ""They wouldn't have to summon them -- the postal workers would be required to just automatically show up."" ""How often?"" ""Every day but Sunday."" ""And then you say that they'd carry the letter anywhere in the country? Door to door?"" ""Yes."" ""So how much would it cost to take a letter from, say, St. Louis, Missouri, to Kansas City, Missouri?"" ""Forty-six cents."" ""But how can you possibly do such a thing so cheaply?"" ""Some people will complain that it's too expensive."" ""All right -- but if it's 46 cents to take a letter from one town in Missouri to another town in Missouri, how much would it cost to carry a letter from, say, New York to San Francisco?"" ""Forty-six cents."" ""What?"" ""It would cost the same, no matter how great the distance."" ""That makes no sense at all. What about the cost of fuel? How can you charge the same amount for a letter to go five miles as you charge for it to go 3,000 miles?"" ""Because that's what people will insist on."" It does sound impossible, doesn't it? It sounds like a plan so farfetched that it would never get off the ground. Yet it has been an unquestioned part of the way we've always lived. We no longer live that way. We expect our information to reach us instantly, on screens and phones and tablets, wherever we may be. But we expect to receive our mail the old way, too. It's an unenviable position for the people who run the Postal Service to be in. See you at the cluster box. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Postal service may kill door-to-door service, switch to 'cluster boxes'

"(CNN) -- Whalers from a Japanese coastal town have celebrated the start of this year's hunting season by slicing up a whale in front of a crowd of school children. In the town of Wada, 62 miles (100 kilometers) south of Tokyo in Chiba prefecture, dozens of 10-year-old students watched Thursday as workers carved up a 30-foot Baird's beaked whale during an educational field trip, before being served a meal of fried whale meat. Whaling remains a way of life for fishermen in Wada, and they are eager to pass on the trade to the next generation. Children are taught about the history of whaling, the biology of the animals, and how to cook the meat. Whalers say they've been catching and eating whales in the area for centuries. This year's hunting season, which began on June 20, is the first since an international court ordered Japan to end its controversial research whaling expedition in the Antarctic, after failing to find evidence the program had legitimate scientific value. The city of Minamiboso, of which Wada is a part, has one of a handful of ports that is exempt from the ban under a small-scale coastal whaling program. So far this year, Gaibo Whaling Company has hunted six whales in the city's coastal waters and plans to catch another 24 before the season ends in August. Despite the Antarctic ban and growing pressure from the international community, Japan has continued its northwest Pacific scientific whaling mission. It is also eager to revise its Antarctic program to allow the hunt to continue while satisfying the demands of the U.N.'s International Court of Justice. In Japan's parliament last month, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he would like the country to resume commercial whaling ""in order to obtain scientific information indispensable to the management of the whale resources."" But environmentalists say Japan's whaling research program is a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent a ban on the commercial whale meat trade. Patrick Ramage from the International Fund for Animal Welfare believes it's time Japan moved from killing whales to conserving them. ""Respect for cultural differences is fundamental, but friends of Japan and fans of Japanese culture around the world are watching this with sadness,"" Ramage told CNN's Will Ripley. ""Japanese school children should be meeting whales through whale watching, not eating whale meat,"" he said. Japan's supporters of eating whale meat say that it is a tradition that dates back hundreds of years, and accuses western critics of cultural imperialism. But consumption rates across the country have fallen in recent years, leading to large stockpiles of whale meat. Last month, Japan's Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry released a photo of the agriculture minister Yoshimasa Hayashi eating a bowl of whale meat to encourage other Japanese citizen to do the same, and visitors to the ministry were given free samples of the delicacy. In a survey of Japanese people released in April, only 4% of respondents said they ate whale meat occasionally, compared to 37% who said they didn't eat it at all. CNN's Will Ripley contributed to this report.","Coastal town teaches children about whaling, serves up fried whale meat .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government says it has reached milestone in the decades-long war on drugs: The Cali cartel, once the biggest drug trafficking organization in the world, is no more. The Treasury Department on Thursday removed 308 people and entities from its financial sanctions list, the largest ever single such de-listing. Treasury officials say the Cali cartel is now considered defunct. The move affects 78 people and 230 companies, real estate holdings and other entities the United States claims were used for money laundering during the heyday of the cartel named for the southern Colombian city famed for its music and mountains. Cartel leaders Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, who were both first placed on the sanctions list in 1995, are serving 30-year prison sentences after pleading guilty in 2006 in Miami to drug trafficking charges. As part of their plea agreement they surrendered $2.1 billion in assets around the world. After the brothers' guilty plea, 28 members of their family signed agreements with the United States to sever ties to narco-trafficking and to surrender assets to the Colombian government. ""Today's action demonstrates the successful use of targeted sanctions, which have destroyed the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers' business empire,"" said Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Adam J. Szubin in a statement. ""The sustained economic pressure on the Cali cartel, at its height the most powerful drug trafficking organization in the world, stemmed from close coordination between multiple U.S. law enforcement agencies and our Colombian counterparts,"" Szubin said. The Cali cartel has been replaced by other drug trafficking groups, even as Colombia has made strides to reduce drug violence and reclaim cities and other parts of the country that were once controlled by cartel gangs and rebel factions that aided trafficking. In recent years, U.S. authorities say there's been the rise of so-called Bandas Criminales, criminal gangs who operate trafficking businesses. A senior Treasury official, in a conference call with reporters Thursday, acknowledged the drug trade remains robust, but said: ""It's a very significant thing to take down a cartel."" The official said the newer organizations are more manageable for authorities to deal with. Treasury's OFAC also says the action illustrates that the sanctions list is always under review. It has removed more than 800 persons from its specially designated nationals and blocked persons sanctions list since 2012 and more than 1,300 in the past seven years.","Cali cartel was once the biggest drug-trafficking organization in the world .

"(CNN) -- If 21st century Africa is a story struggling for equality in the global community of stories, to paraphrase Africa's most famous novelist, Chinua Achebe, then Bob Geldof, Bono, and international aid and charity organizations are not the only actors seeking a space in that narrative. Continental Africa too is seeking a space in her own story -- the first step in telling and owning her own story. Eventually. For Western actors in the Mercy Industrial Complex, there is a story; for Africans, there are stories. Perhaps, folks have been a tad harsh on the Mercy Industrial Complex. Perhaps there has been a little progress, a slight evolution in their narrative. In the 20th century, the Mercy Industrial Complex saw Ethiopia as Africa. In the 21st century, the tally of countries allowed to stand in for the entire continent has increased to three: Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. Gone are the days when a single country could function as Africa's metonym. Across Africa, there are folks who challenge this narrative with alternative stories showcasing the continent's boundless energy, genius, innovation, and youth opportunity. These African voices insist that they know it is Christmas. They insist that their hard work has rebuilt Angola to the point where that African country now has to bail out debt-ridden and economically-stagnating Portugal in Western Europe with financial aid and bailouts. There is a third force in the struggle to narrate Africa. This third force is opposed to the narrative of the Mercy Industrial Complex but does not rush to embrace the euphoric counter-narratives of the new voices of African hope either. Yet, you cannot accuse her of racism or not wanting the best for Africa. She is Africa's new diaspora in Euro-America. And she is insisting that Africa's new story will not be told without her. She left Africa at the beginning of the 1980s when murderous military despotism, combined with a deadly cocktail of ruinous policies imposed by the IMF and the World Bank to empty the continent of hope. Now, this activist diaspora insists on her story of Africa. She is saying that new narratives of progress must not overlook the albatross of corruption and poor governance. Social media has enhanced her activism, allowing her to intervene and shape opinion in individual African countries in a manner that is unprecedented. Her relentless scrutiny of the narratives of progress and hope often pitches her against the state in Africa. Ordinary citizens in Africa also sometimes view the vocal intervention and activism of the new diaspora with suspicion. ""You are always talking about corruption and poor governance as if that were the only story in Africa. What is the difference between you and those who only see Ebola in Africa? Who made you a referee on African issues from the safety of Euro-America? After all, you abandoned the continent when the going was tough!"" These are the usual arguments with which Africa delegitimizes her new diaspora on social media. But this new diaspora will not be shooed away easily. She insists on her legitimacy, brandishing the monetary remittances she makes annually to the continent. Diaspora remittances now outweigh Western aid to Africa. The BBC reports that in 2010, Africans living outside of the continent remitted $51.8 billion to the continent. In the absence of formal welfare mechanisms in many African countries, diaspora remittances fill the void. ""If I am sending this sort of money to the continent"", says the new diaspora, ""I have a stake in her stories. I can criticize corruption and poor governance. I can be dissatisfied with mediocrity. I will not be silenced"". Defying silence is what led to the story of Sahara Reporters, one of Africa's most phenomenal diaspora success stories. Founded by New York-based Omoyele Sowore, Sahara Reporters is an online news dedicated to fighting corruption in Nigeria. It has become the go-to medium for international news organizations for Nigeria news. Sahara Reporters' website nets over two million visits per month. Her Facebook fan page has over a million likes. Yet, Sowore and his syndicated columnists, myself included, are always attacked by the Nigerian state and irritated citizens based mostly on the fact that their intervention in Nigerian affairs is done from the United States and Canada. In London this weekend, organizers of TEDxEUSTON, will assemble some of Africa's best to discuss the theme, Facing Forward. In my view, the speakers, a healthy mix of Africans based in the continent and Euro-America, will confront an important question: can Africa face forward by delegitimizing her new diaspora?

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Islamist militants killed one Somali lawmaker and wounded another in a drive-by shooting in the capital on Thursday morning, the third assassination of a Parliament member this year, police and a legislator said. Mohamed Mohamud Hayd and a security guard were shot and killed near a hotel by gunmen riding in a speeding minivan in Mogadishu's Hamarweyne district, lawmaker Hussein Arab Isse said. Another federal lawmaker, Abdullahi Ahmed Hussein, also known as ""Onka,"" was seriously injured in the shooting and taken to a hospital for treatment, authorities said. In a statement posted on a pro-militant website, the al-Qaeda-linked Islamist group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. It said the attack was a ""beginning of Ramadan offensive,"" referring to the start of a monthlong fasting period for Muslims. The attackers were wearing Somali army uniforms, Isse said. They drove away after the shooting, police Capt. Abdalla Jama said. Al-Shabaab's aim is to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, though it has carried out attacks in other African countries, as well. The group carried out the mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya, in September that left at 67 people dead. Hayd ""was a man who served his country and his people,"" Somali government spokesman Ridwaan Haji Adbiwali said. ""We condemn this and any other murders, especially during the holy month of Ramadan,"" Abdiwali said. ""Islam does not support the killing of innocents, brothers slaying brothers and criminal acts."" Hayd's death comes more than three months after the assassinations of two other lawmakers, and almost six weeks since a bloody attack on the parliament headquarters. On April 21 in Mogadishu, a hidden bomb exploded in a car containing Parliament member Isack Mohamed Ali, popularly known as Isack Rino, killing him, officials said. The next day, gunmen shot and killed lawmaker Abdulaziz Isaak Mursal as he drove to work from his home in Mogadishu's Dharkenley neighborhood, police said. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for both killings. On May 24, al-Shabaab militants attacked Parliament headquarters with guns and explosives in a siege that lasted more than three hours. At least 10 people were killed and 11 others injured, witnesses and officials said. Security forces killed some of the attackers, and other militants died by blowing themselves up, police said. Al-Shabaab, designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, has a relationship with al Qaeda that goes back several years. The two groups effectively merged in 2012, according to CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness . Aid workers freed in Somalia after nearly two years .

"Dallas (CNN) -- A district attorney in Texas said Thursday that the statute of limitations prohibits the filing of charges against a judge shown in a 2004 video repeatedly beating his then-teenage daughter. The daughter, meanwhile, told CNN's Anderson Cooper she uploaded the graphic video as a way to reconcile with Judge William Adams. ""I wanted to show my father, 'Hey, I think you were in some denial about the way you are treating me and my mother.' And maybe showing him this would make him see something he didn't before,"" Hillary Adams, now 23, told CNN. William Adams, a court-at-law judge in Aransas County, Texas, faces a judicial conduct probe over the incident. Aransas County District Attorney Patrick Flanigan sent a letter to Rockport Police Chief Tim Jayroe Thursday evening, informing him of his decision on prosecution. ""It is clear that no criminal misdemeanor information nor any criminal felony indictment may be presented for any criminal charge that may be depicted on the subject video,"" Flanigan wrote. ""Limitations prevent prosecution of any applicable criminal charge shown on said video."" Rockport police said they would contact federal authorities to determine whether any criminal charges may be filed in federal court. Earlier, Flanigan said authorities were looking at numerous factors, including the child's age and the statute of limitations. The law is complex on which charges could be brought, he said, and which statutes may apply -- all speculation until the video is confirmed to be authentic. A criminal defense lawyer said it was not likely that Adams could be prosecuted. In an offense involving injury to a child, Texas law defines a child as being 14 years or less, said Houston lawyer Chris Tritico. Hillary Adams was 16 in the video. Jayroe said the statute of limitations for felony injury to a child is five years. The video shows the judge whipping his daughter with a belt, cursing at her and berating her. The 2004 beating occurred when her father was punishing her for using the Internet ""to acquire music and games that were unavailable for legal purchase at the time,"" Hillary Adams wrote on the Internet posting. She said she released the video after being harassed by her father. Hillary Adams' comments to ""AC360"" came shortly after William Adams said she posted the video after he warned this year he might reduce financial support to her. ""If the public must know, just prior to the YouTube upload, a concerned father shared with his 23-year-old daughter that he was unwilling to continue to work hard and be her primary source of financial support, if she was going to simply 'drop out,' and strive to achieve no more in life than to work part-time at a video game store,"" the judge said in a statement. Adams said Hillary told him that if he ""reduced her financial support, and took away her Mercedes automobile, which her father had provided, he would live to regret it. The post was then uploaded."" Asked on ""AC360"" to respond, Hillary Adams said, ""I think that's a perfect example of the way he would always twist stories in our community to make him come out as the good guy."" She said her father, while assisting, was not her primary source of financial support. The father wrote Hillary Adams ""inexplicably dropped out"" two classes shy of completing her college studies. Hillary and her mother, Hallie Adams, spoke with Cooper about what they called a dysfunctional home where violence was a regular occurrence. The mother participated in the videotaped beating, but has since apologized. She said her former husband told her to help administer the punishment. ""I thought he was a monster,"" Hallie Adams said about her review of the video. ""I thought that I was a witch."" Hillary Adams said she left her video camera on her dresser recording and covered its light with a scarf in order to capture the video. The video is punctuated by cracks of the man's belt and the girl's screams and cries. At one point in the 7 1/2-minute video, the man says to his near-hysterical daughter, ""What happened to you, Hillary? Once you were an obedient, nice little girl. Now you lie, cheat and steal."" He yells at her, ""You want to put some more computer games on? You want some more?"" ""Are you happy?"" he asks her. ""Disobeying your parents? You don't deserve to f---ing be in this house."" He also berates the girl's mother for allowing a ""f---ing computer"" in the house. The older woman also strikes the girl with a belt once, and near the end of the video instructs the girl not to ""touch one other thing on the computer besides your schoolwork until you are given notice otherwise."" Asked whether William Adams, who handles family-related and juvenile court issues, should oversee such matters, Hillary Adams said, ""I don't think he's fit for the position."" But she was worried about him losing his job. ""I really don't know what the solution for him is,"" she told Cooper. ""Except that I really want him to seek some kind of help."" Her father questioned her motives and timing. ""Perhaps Hillary Adams should explain, if she felt she was raised by a tyrannical father, a claim shared with no one until five years after adulthood, why she insisted on living with her father and not her mother from the time of her parent's divorce, until she moved out on her own,"" William Adams said. ""Hillary Adams has been living on her own for some time, and has been an adult for almost six years, so why post the video in late 2011?"" Meanwhile, the state Commission of Judicial Conduct was inundated with calls, e-mails and faxes, it said in an online statement announcing the start of a probe into the matter. Aransas County Attorney Richard Bianchi said his office was also overwhelmed with calls and e-mails, including some from overseas, since the video went viral on the Internet. ""Just a sad day.

Adams was temporarily relieved of his duties for the next two weeks, and a visiting judge will take over his caseload while the matter is being investigated, according to the office of Aransas County Administrative Judge Burt Mills. In an interview with KZTV outside his Rockport, Texas, home Wednesday, Adams confirmed to a reporter that he was the man beating his daughter with a belt and a board on the video. ""She's mad because I've ordered her to bring the car back, in a nutshell, but yeah, that's me. I lost my temper,"" Adams told the station. ""Her mother was there, she wasn't hurt ... it was a long time ago ... I really don't want to get into this right now because as you can see my life's been made very difficult over this child."" Adams continued: ""In my mind I have not done anything wrong other than discipline my child when she was caught stealing. I did lose my temper, I've apologized. It looks worse than it is."" William Adams told KRIS that the conduct is ""not as bad as it looks on tape."" The judge said he had contacted judicial review officials in Austin and ""more will come out"" in the investigation, KRIS reported. Whether Adams will face consequences for beating his daughter remains to be seen. But he will have to face the public three years from now, when he is up for re-election. ""I don't want to see my father prosecuted,"" Hillary Adams told CNN. ""I don't want to see him punished by the law because I think he's been punished enough by all this.

"(CNN) -- There will be no more Mo'ne Davis, at least for now. The Sports Illustrated cover girl and her Philadelphia team are out of the Little League World Series after losing an elimination game Thursday night in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to a squad from Chicago. Mo'ne's Taney Dragons jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead, but it didn't last. The Jackie Robinson West Little League club went ahead 4-2 in the bottom of the first inning, and added two more runs the next frame. Taney narrowed the score to 6-4 in the fourth inning, then to 6-5 the next. But despite advancing the tying runner to third base in the bottom of the sixth and final inning, the Dragons couldn't finish off the comeback. The result means Chicago will face off against Las Vegas at 3:30 p.m. ET Saturday for the U.S. championship. The winner of that game plays for the World Series title on Sunday. It also ends Mo'ne's high-profile run on youth baseball's biggest stage. While other girls have played in the World Series, none have gotten the same attention as the South Philadelphia resident and Taney Dragons standout. The 13-year-old became a national sensation after tossing a shutout -- giving up three hits and notching six strikeouts in the process -- to help Taney become one of the final 16 World Series contenders. Mo'ne persistently deflected attention to her teammates -- all of them boys -- even as the media consistently made her the headline. She recalled how she happened into baseball after a coach spotted her tossing a football, how her stellar play caught some off-guard and how she interacts with her teammates. One would expect, then, that this will all die down. Mo'ne is too old to be in another World Series. But that doesn't mean we won't hear from her again. The Sports Illustrated cover says it straight out: ""Mo'ne -- remember her name (as if we could ever forget)."" The accompanying story says Mo'ne's first love is basketball and her dream is to play for legendary coach Geno Auriemma's University of Connecticut team. Elliott Hughes-Taylor doesn't doubt Mo'ne can do it, saying she ""completely dominated the Philly league (despite) every play matching up with 6-foot-2, 6-3 boys."" ""Everyone's seen her pitch,"" Hughes-Taylor, Mo'ne's coach in soccer, told SI. ""Well, I promise you, she's five times better at basketball.""

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- A rambling, 1,500-page manifesto purportedly written by the suspect in Friday's deadly terror attacks in Norway lays out right-wing extremist views and vows that a ""European civil war"" will lead to the execution of ""cultural Marxists"" and the banishing of Muslims. ""If you are concerned about the future of Western Europe you will definitely find the information both interesting and highly relevant,"" the author writes, adding later that his ""European Declaration of Independence"" took him nine years to complete. While the title page of the document says ""By Andrew Berwick,"" the writer later identifies himself as Anders Behring Breivik, the suspect in the Norwegian terrorist attacks. The document -- part political diatribe, part confessional and part action plan -- also contains a link to an online video post with the same title. CNN could not independently verify that Breivik wrote the document or posted the 12-minute video, and Norwegian authorities would not confirm that the man in their custody wrote the manifesto, saying it was part of their investigation. Police told the Norwegian newspaper VG that the document is ""linked"" to Friday's attacks. Text in the video rails against the ""Islamization"" of Europe and ""cultural Marxists"" and asserts that the majority of Europe's population will be Muslim by 2050 ""unless we manage to defeat the ruling Multiculturalist Alliance."" ""Celebrate us, the martyrs of the conservative revolution, for we will soon dine in the Kingdom of Heaven,"" the video says. Parts of the document use the same wording as the 35,000-word anti-technology manifesto written by ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski and published in the Washington Post in 1995. In one passage, the document published online last week uses the same wording as the Unabomber's manifesto, but substitutes the phrase ""cultural Marxist"" where Kaczynski used the word ""leftist,"" and uses the word ""Muslims"" where Kaczynski used the phrase ""black people."" The document contains some of the same anti-Muslim rhetoric that has become a part of mainstream debate in Norway, according to Anders Ravik Jupskaas, a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Oslo who studies right-wing political movements in Scandinavia. ""What you see here is this new European phenomenon of this anti-Islamic rhetoric, where it's not only the immigrants (who are enemies). In fact, the main enemy is the political elite,"" he said. ""They argue that this political elite has betrayed their own country. They have imposed multiculturalism."" But the writer takes such philosophies to another level, he said. ""It's part of the same stream of ideas, but it's still very different in terms of extremeness,"" Jupskaas said. Norwegian authorities have said they are still trying to determine the motive behind the terror attacks. In the manifesto, the author vilifies Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and his Labour Party, which has majority control in Norway's government, accusing the party of perpetuating ""cultural Marxist/multiculturalist ideals"" and indoctrinating youth with those ideals. The author accuses the Labour Party of embracing those ideals and therefore allowing the ""Islamification of Europe."" The manifesto speculates about would happen if the author were to survive ""a successful mission and live to stand a multiculturalist trial."" ""Not only will all my friends and family detest me and call me a monster; the united global multiculturalist media will have their hands full figuring out multiple ways to character assassinate, vilify and demonize,"" it says. The manifesto and videoinclude photos that appear to match those of the suspect, some of which had been posted on his Facebook page and several never-before-seen images of the same man. The author leaves clues about his family and background, and also indicates that English is his ""secondary language."" The document and video are titled ""2083: A European Declaration of Independence,"" a date that the author later explains is the year he believes an European civil war will end with the execution of cultural Marxists and the deportation of Muslims. This ""civil war"" would come in three phases, he predicts. The first runs through 2030 and includes ""open source warfare, military shock attacks by clandestine cell systems (and) further consolidation of conservative forces."" Between 2030 and 2070, he calls for ""more advanced forms of resistance groups (and the) preparation of pan-European coup d'etats."" The final stage features the deposition of Europe's leaders and ""implementation of a cultural conservative political agenda."" The author does not specifically explain why he chose the date 2083, though it is the 200th anniversary of the death of Karl Marx. The manifesto and video also containphotos of Breivik in what appear to be uniforms, including one in which he is wearing a U.S. Marine dress jacket decorated with an Iron Cross, Knights Templar and Free Mason medals. Another picture shows Breivik dressed in a wet suit with a patch that reads ""Marxist Hunter"" and holding a high-powered rifle. The author states that he was moved to action dating to ""my government's involvement"" in NATO's 1999 strikes during the Kosovo campaign, claiming this wrongly targeted ""our Serbian brothers (who) wanted to drive Islam out by deporting the Albanian Muslims back to Albania."" He also criticizes ""my government's cowardly handling of the Muhammad cartoon issue"" -- a reference to the Norwegian government's apology for the nation's private newspapers having repeatedly published the controversial cartoon. Another reference blasts Norway, home of the Nobel awards, for awarding a peace prize to late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The author details his bomb-making experiments, including a theory that one should purchase a farm so that purchase of large amounts of fertilizer -- which can be used to make bombs -- is less likely to be noticed. ""Be extra careful when researching for bomb schematics (fertilizer bombs), as many terms will trigger electronic alerts,"" he writes, one of several tips that include using an ""anonymous laptop and browse free to your local McDonalds"" in order to ""avoid ending up on any watch list."" Besides hands-on instructions, the document also functions as a running diary. It also includes references to his relatives' sexual indiscretions, entries on some of his friends' personal lives, and his own off-and-on steroid use. From July 2 on, though, the author becomes more business-like and complains that going off his testosterone supplements had ramped up his ""aggressiveness."" He then digs up his guns and prepares the bombs. It all leads up to July 22, the date of the Norway terror attacks. ""The old saying 'if you want something done, then do it yourself' is as relevant now as it was then,"" he writes. ""In many cases; you could do it all yourself, it will just take a little more time. AND, without taking unacceptable risks. The conclusion is undeniable. ""I believe this will be my last entry. It is now Fri July 22nd, 12.51."" Less than three hours later, a bomb went off in downtown Oslo. CNN's Greg Botelho, Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, on Saturday that ""Russia should not intervene in Ukraine under the guise of humanitarian convoys or any other pretext of 'peacekeeping,'"" according to a senior State Department official. Kerry urged ""all parties to work through international organizations"" to provide humanitarian assistance in eastern Ukraine, the official said. In a separate call Saturday, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko agreed that any Russian action in Ukraine, even for purported ""humanitarian"" purposes, without the formal, express consent and authorization of the Ukraine government would be ""unacceptable and a violation of international law,"" according to the White House. Russia has denied allegations that it is supporting separatists in Ukraine and maintains it wants to see a diplomatic solution to the ongoing crisis there. But U.S. and Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of saying one thing while doing another: increasing troop levels along the border and continuing to send support to pro-Russian separatists. Pro-Russian separatists say 'fight to the death' Despite claims by Ukrainian officials, the pro-Russian separtists hold firm that Ukrainian forces ""have never been able to take over the Donetsk districts"" -- the hotbed of violence in eastern Ukraine. The self-proclaimed leader of the Donetsk people's republic said on Saturday that pro-Russian separatists would consider a humanitarian cease-fire to bring aid to civilians but they are not ready to surrender their territory and would ""fight to the death."" ""We are ready for ceasefire to avoid escalation of the humanitarian disaster in Donbass,"" Alexander Zakharchenko, prime minister of the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic in a statement, said, referring to the populous region that includes Donetsk.

"(CNN) -- A New Hampshire hospital worker was sentenced to 39 years in prison Monday for causing a multistate outbreak of hepatitis C last year, according to a news release from the U.S. attorney's office in New Hampshire. David Kwiatkowski pleaded guilty to seven counts of tampering with a consumer product and seven counts of obtaining controlled substances by fraud in New Hampshire's U.S. District Court, according to a plea agreement filed in August. Thirty people were diagnosed with the virus that attacks the liver and can be fatal. Ten months after he was diagnosed with hepatitis C, Kwiatkowski began working at New Hampshire's Exeter Hospital in April 2011. Investigators said Kwiatkowski stole syringes of the painkiller fentanyl from patients who were scheduled for surgery. ""Kwiatkowski used the stolen syringes to inject himself, causing them to become tainted with his infected blood, before filling them with saline and then replacing them for use in the medical procedure,"" the U.S. attorney's office in Concord, New Hampshire, said in a statement. ""Consequently, instead of receiving the prescribed dose of fentanyl, patients instead received saline tainted by Kwiatkowski's infected blood."" According to the plea agreement, Kwiatkowski told an investigator, ""I'm going to kill a lot of people out of this."" Before moving to New Hampshire, Kwiatkowski worked as a traveling medical technician for hospitals in Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania, officials in those states said. Kwiatkowski was fired from an Arizona hospital in 2010 after a fellow employee found him passed out in the men's room with a syringe floating in the toilet, according to documents obtained by CNN.

"(CNN) -- California may be known for its earthquakes, but so far this year it has been surpassed by an unlikely state: Oklahoma. Experts say wastewater wells are likely linked to the big increase in the number of quakes recorded in Oklahoma. Between 1978 and 2008, Oklahoma experienced an average of just two quakes of 3.0 magnitude of greater. In 2014, as of Thursday, there have been about 207 such quakes recorded in the state, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The upward trend started in 2009, with 20 quakes of 3.0 magnitude or greater, then 43 the following year, and jumping every year with the exception of 2012. Oklahoma has now surpassed California in quakes, and seismologists see no end in sight, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. California has recorded about 140 3.0-magnitude quakes or greater, compared to 207 in Oklahoma. The oil and gas industry's injection of wastewater deep into the Earth apparently is linked to the shift in seismic activity in Oklahoma, Myers said. The fracturing fluid seems to be lubricating existing faults that have not moved in recent years, he said. The fracturing process is not creating new faults, but are exposing faults that already exist, he said. On Wednesday, at least seven earthquakes were recorded in Oklahoma, according to the USGS. There were no reports of significant damage, but that doesn't mean that these quakes are not of concern to scientists. ""The fact that the number of earthquakes in Oklahoma is even comparable to California is unusual,"" USGS geophysicist Rob Williams said. ""We've seen swarms of earthquakes over the interior of the U.S., but this is on a completely different scale, for the area where all the earthquakes are occurring is bigger than any previous swarm,"" he added. ""It's not really a swarm, it's really a collection of swarms."" It cannot be ruled out that the spike in earthquakes is a once-every-10,000-years thing, but scientists don't know and a surprised by the numbers. ""Given the rate of earthquakes over the last six months, it's concerning enough to be worried about a larger, damaging earthquake happening, let alone what might happen in the future,"" Williams said. Many of these quakes are being linked to wastewater injection, he said. Some earthquakes have been linked to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, but for the most part, the Oklahoma earthquakes are linked to wastewater wells, Williams said. Geophysicists have not been able to gather data to pin down the certain set of wastewater wells that are causing the earthquake problem, but they're hopeful to learn more about the problematic wells in the future. Research into the links between the wastewater wells and quakes started about four years ago, Williams said. To better gauge the increased quakes, USGS and Oklahoma officials have added monitoring stations, which now stand at 15 permanent facilities and 17 temporary stations. The Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association last month urged a wait-and-see approach in judging the USGS's assertions on links between wastewater disposal and earthquakes. ""Because crude oil and natural gas is produced in 70 of Oklahoma's 77 counties, any seismic activity within the state is likely to occur near oil and natural gas activity. The OIPA and the oil and gas industry as a whole support the continued study of Oklahoma's increased seismic activity, but a rush to judgment provides no clear understanding of the causes,"" the industry group said.

"(CNN) -- A tide of border crossings by children mostly from Central America is not expected to end soon, and some in Congress blame President Barack Obama for policies they claim opened the floodgate. Holding centers in Texas can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling alone with their kids, forcing the federal government to open additional facilities. One is in Nogales, Arizona, where pictures of unaccompanied children lying on the floor of a large barren facility raised concerns of a humanitarian crisis. But Nogales Mayor Arturo Garina said the site, which serves as an overflow center for up to 1,000, is addressing the immediate need for shelter. ""I'm very comfortable with what I saw,"" he said on CNN's ""New Day."" He said there are makeshift cafeterias and medical centers and that telephone banks and computers have been set up to process people and contact relatives. Border crossers . Unaccompanied children and partial families from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala make up the majority of those crossing the border, creating a delicate situation for states, the federal government and immigrants. Of the 1,200 or so crossing the Rio Grande in eastern Texas every day, up to 400 are unaccompanied children, said Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who represents the district where most of the crossings occur. ""This is a humanitarian crisis,"" he said in a phone interview, adding that the government has to figure out how to feed, diaper and care for the children as young as infants. Many of the immigrants use rafts to cross the Rio Grande, equipped with instructions to follow the river until reaching the Border Patrol site to surrender. The illegal immigrants include a group of Honduran girls, some as young as 14. One told CNN she did so ""because I want to see my parents in Austin."" The Obama administration is not releasing the statistics or much information about the recent influx. But Chris Cabrera, a labor leader for Border Patrol agents, told CNN that he expects 60,000 unaccompanied children will cross the border this year. The Migration Policy Institute has kept track and said that about 8,000 minors crossed alone in any given year. But there was a sharp increase in 2011, including 10,000 in U.S. custody that summer. ""You're talking kids from 17 years old on down to some that are 5 or 6 years old, traveling by themselves,"" Cabrera said. Last year, roughly 10% of people caught by Border Patrol agents were minors, according to an agency official. Why are they coming? Some members of Congress say Obama's policies and a lack of enforcement are to blame. ""The President has sent the message out he is not going to enforce the law,"" Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican whose commentary on immigration reform drew sharp criticism, told CNN's ""New Day."" ""That message has echoed out."" Critics, such as King, point to Obama's decision in 2012 to stop most deportations of young people brought to the United States as children. Garina said that could be the reason children are coming in droves, but many involved in the issue say the reasons are much broader and complex. A recent United Nations report that interviewed 400 young immigrants points to a difficult and complicated web of reasons, including difficult-to-escape gang and societal violence in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as well as dire economic situations and the desire to reunify with their parents or family members in the United States. State outrage . Texas has been so overwhelmed that federal officials are transporting busloads of immigrants, including minors, to Arizona. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer slammed the move. ""Not only does the federal government have no plan to stop this disgraceful policy, it also has no plan to deal with the endless waves of illegal aliens once they are released here,"" she said in a statement. After the children have been processed, the are transferred to Department of Health and Human Services run facilities at Lackland Air Base in Texas or Ventura County Naval Base in California. The administration announced that a third facility in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, which will house up to 1,200 minors. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallon also criticized the decision, questioning if the site is really going to be a temporary fix or turn into something more permanent as the number of young immigrants is expected to keep increasing. ""I am dismayed by what appears to be an endless cycle of illegal immigration, temporary housing and eventual amnesty for those who have broken our laws. Today's news is the latest in a long line of policy missteps that the American people are paying for."" What's next . U.S. law prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from immediately deporting the children if they are not from Canada or Mexico. Instead, the children are turned over to Department Health and Human Services supervision ""within 72 hours of DHS taking them into custody,"" an official said. Relatives living in the United States are searched for and contacted and the immigrant is given a court date. But very few actually show up and the children often become one of the millions of undocumented immigrants. Obama declared the crossings ""an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response."" Earlier this month, in a memo to the heads of executive departments and agencies, he announced an ""interagency Unified Coordination Group to ensure unity of effort across the executive branch in responding to the humanitarian aspects of this situation."" The group will oversee coordination with state, local and other agencies. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is establishing the group. In a statement, he said that ""addressing the rising flow of unaccompanied children crossing our southwest border is an important priority of this administration and the Department of Homeland Security."" The administration is also forced to ask Congress for more money to address the higher-than-expected number of cases. Cuellar, who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, said the administration originally asked for $800 million to address the matter, but that number has gone up to $2.1 billion.

"(CNN) -- Embattled Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh met Sunday with top military and security officials Sunday to talk about ""hostilities and crimes"" occurring in his country, the Yemeni State News Agency reported. The meeting came amid new reports of clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters in Taiz, where witnesses said tens of thousands of demonstrators had taken to the streets Sunday. Dozens of people were wounded as security forces opened fire on the demonstrators in an effort to disperse them, witnesses told CNN Sunday. Hundreds of protesters responded by throwing rocks at the security forces, which drew more gunfire from the troops, witnesses said. A medical official in Taiz estimated that at least five people were killed and 90 people had been wounded in Sunday's violence. Government troops battled suspected Islamic militants for control of a coastal city in Yemen, witnesses said, two days after many soldiers and police abandoned the city. Hundreds of soldiers had moved back into the city by Sunday and were fighting the militants in Zinjibar. At least 35 people were hospitalized, according to a medical official who asked not to be named for security reasons. The militants ""suddenly arrived and in large numbers. There were no clashes when they arrived on Friday night. We tried to complain to security forces but could not find them,"" said a resident of the city of Zinjibar, east of Aden, who also asked not to be named for security reasons. By Saturday, ""hundreds"" of masked militants controlled the main streets of the city, locals said. About 200 militants began ""attacking ferociously and took everybody by surprise"" Saturday morning, according to a Yemeni government official who asked not to be named, since he was not authorized to speak to journalists. Chaos followed as government security forces, including police and soldiers, abandoned their posts, the government source said. Heavy fighting raged Sunday between the Yemeni Army's 25th Mechanized Brigade and the militants, the source said. More than two dozen soldiers have been killed since the start of the battle Saturday, the source said. Abyan province, where Zinjibar is located, is a hotbed of Islamic militancy in Yemen, a country that has become a key battleground against al Qaeda. Witnesses in the city described the forces in Zinjibar as ""Islamic militants"" but did not specify that they were al Qaeda. Meanwhile, in the capital Sanaa, both the government and the al-Hashid tribe say they have not reached a cease-fire agreement after days of street battles. But a spokesman for the tribe says it is handing back key government buildings it has been occupying. ""Hashid tribes have given the government a number of buildings back after (President Ali Abdullah) Saleh promised not to use them to launch attacks on the tribes,"" Abdulqawi al-Qaisi said. ""However, this does not mean that a cease-fire has been signed,"" he said, saying it meant the tribe was ""cooperating for a cease-fire to succeed."" Government spokesman Tarq Shami said no deal had been made with the tribe, but that it would halt all military action against them for two days to allow mediators to broker a deal between the two sides. Neither side said which facilities were involved. The tribe has been occupying four government ministry buildings. Shami said the government could retake the buildings ""in no time, but (the government) does not want violence."" The powerful al-Hashid tribe rose up against long-time leader Saleh in the last week, after he backed out of a regionally brokered deal meant to ease him out of office and end months of demonstrations of the kind that have swept the Arab world this year. Saleh has been resisting protests calling on him to step down after 33 years in power. The recent fighting has raised fears of a full-blown civil war in Yemen, an impoverished, arid and mountainous nation that has been a key U.S. ally in the battle against the al Qaeda terrorist network.","NEW: At least 5 protesters are dead and 90 wounded in Taiz, a medical official says .

"(CNN) -- One minute and eight seconds. That's how long it was from the moment Connor Walsh walked into the copy room to when Pax Curtis dropped his pants. In between, the two chatted about illegal stock trading and working long hours, but fans of the hit ABC legal drama ""How to Get Away With Murder"" were not really tweeting about that. Anytime-anywhere sex scenes are part of the show's DNA, so the over-the-top scenario in the copy room was par for the course. Particularly for young Connor, a handsome law student, who in a later episode scored in a courthouse restroom with a guy he had forgotten he had sex with months earlier. As you can imagine, Connor flashes a great smile and a lot of flesh. He does not, however, ever flash a condom. And here, ladies and gentlemen, is where the conversation gets a bit uncomfortable. For as much as the network show is somewhat revolutionary for its willingness to showcase same-sex lovemaking, there is a question of how responsible that portrayal is. This week, we observed World AIDS Day, and we are reminded that in 2014 the virus may be manageable, but it isn't cured. It still kills. There are 35 million living with HIV the world over, and 19 million don't know it. And in the United States, men who have sex with men make up 63% of all new infections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It isn't realistic to expect a character on TV to double as a public service announcement. But since only 32 of the 813 prime-time scripted series regulars are LGBT -- and not many of those 32 are seen having sex (especially like Connor) -- it seems reasonable to have high expectations for their behavior. ""There has been a conversation about it,"" Jack Falahee, the 25-year-old Michigan native who plays Connor, told me. ""I'm not privy to all of the discussion that happens in the writers' room, but I do know early on the topic of safer sex has been brought up. ""The interesting thing is when Connor is engaging in sex there actually has been condoms in the scene, they just have never made the final shot. When Connor was with Oliver, there were condoms on the table by the bed; when he had sex with Pax, there was a condom on the set then."" If a gay character is having safer sex and no one sees it, is he really having it? ""You never see James Bond pull out a condom,"" Falahee said. ""Maybe society has progressed to the point where we can treat heterosexual scenes and homosexual scenes the same. Or maybe there is something socially that makes us all uncomfortable about seeing a couple on TV pause to use protection no matter who that couple is."" Falahee's character has become a bit of a lightning rod for a litany of sex and society stories in the media, from The Washington Post to BuzzFeed. On Sunday, Falahee is attending a fund-raiser for the Trevor Project, his first appearance at a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender event since the show's debut. The Trevor Project is a nonprofit organization addressing suicide prevention -- not HIV/AIDS -- but he expects as the chatter about his character grows, so will his involvement with other groups. Especially since his brother is an immunologist. ""I'm aware of the conversations that are happening today about drugs that can prevent you from contracting HIV,"" Falahee said. ""It's a really important one to have, and not a lot of people know about them."" He is referring to pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP for short. Essentially it is treatment as prevention. And while there are some, such as AIDS activist Larry Kramer, who question the logic of taking medicine before you are sick, that is in fact something we already do. For example, we are encouraged to take antimalarial drugs before traveling to countries where the virus is prevalent. Studies have found the antiretrovirals used to treat patients who are HIV positive reduce the chances of HIV-negative people contracting the virus by 96%. The findings are so promising that the White House has included PrEP in its strategy to reduce the overall number of new HIV infections by 25% in 2015. All great news -- the problem is getting the word out, and that's where a popular TV character such as Connor comes in. ""This is a conversation elites, white gay bloggers, policy people and researchers are having,"" John Schneider, an associate professor at the University of Chicago and director of the Chicago Center for HIV Elimination, told me. ""This conversation is not happening in the community that needs to hear it most -- young gay and bisexual men of color."" Last summer I attended the first White House symposium on HIV/AIDS specifically targeting the LGBT community and was shocked to learn that black gay and bisexual youth -- men having sex with men, or MSM -- between the ages of 13 and 24 account for 55% of new MSM infections in that age group. Neil Giuliano, CEO of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, told me that while it is true young men of color are more likely to contract the virus than other groups, it is important that activists and media alike push the information out to everyone to end AIDS. ""Culture influences behavior,"" Giuliano said. ""It influences behavior people find acceptable and behavior that is unacceptable. And when you look at the arc of LGBT rights, without question the fair, accurate and inclusiveness in media has been nothing short of transformative in the experience we have in our everyday lives. ""So yeah, it would be amazing to have Connor talk about PrEP because it would help get the message out. We don't want to tell people what to do or how to live their lives. But we want them to be informed."" It's a sentiment echoed by Darrel Cummings, chief of staff at the Los Angeles LGBT Center. ""We have not been parental in this,"" he said. ""We tell people this is one of the tools that's helpful in stopping the transmission of HIV and let them make up their own minds. There are naysayers out there. There are people who say PrEP encourages people to be promiscuous, but that hasn't been our experience."" People still smoke. People still drink and drive. People still eat poorly. Having a TV character talk about safe sex is not the silver bullet that will kill AIDS. But it is another mode of disseminating critical information in the fight, much in the way Vice President Joe Biden cited ""Will & Grace"" as a show that helped change the country's attitude toward same-sex marriage. So yeah, it's great that Connor and the other 31 LGBT characters can have sex like everyone else on TV. But now that we're watching, what will they show us?","Gay characters on ""How to Get Away With Murder"" don't appear to use condoms .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- U.S. authorities have learned more about two Los Angeles-area men claiming in a video to be gang members fighting in Syria: It turns out they are Syrian nationals of Armenian descent who were deported back to that country because of their criminal history. One of the men is Nercis Kilajian, whom U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported to Syria in 2012, according to local and federal records provided by Sgt. Tom Lorenz of the Glendale Police Department. The spelling of that name in the police records is different from a Nerses Kilajyan that a Middle East news research group found on his Facebook page, but phonetically, it is similar. The other man in the video is Sarou Madarian, who was deported to Syria in 2010, Lorenz said Thursday. In the video, Madarian identifies himself only as ""Creeper"" of the Sun Valley GW-13 gang and leaves the false impression that he's a Latino gang member because he sprinkles Spanish words in his fluent English. Lorenz said Madarian is a member of the Grumpy Winos gang from Sun Valley. Their YouTube video showed them firing rifles in Syria's civil war, apparently fighting on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Some Armenians side with al-Assad because he has protected the minority group in Syria. Never do the two men face return fire in the video, however. In the profanity-laced video, the two men fire rifles from behind a cinder-block wall at ""enemigos"" -- enemies -- though the camera never shows an enemy in the distance. The two men often refer to ""gang-banging"" and their ""homies,"" and Madarian displays gang hand gestures and tattoos. The video was publicized this week by the Middle East Media Research Institute, a Washington-based organization that studies and translates news accounts and social-media postings. ""This is very unique because these guys are over there, and they are with the pro-Syria forces and pro-Hezbollah forces,"" said Steven Stalinsky, executive director of the institute. ""We have been monitoring foreign fighters over the years, and there has been a handful of Americans going to fight, but they have been going to fight against Assad."" The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces is investigating the video. ""The JTTF is aware of the video and is investigating to determine any potential threat to Americans or to U.S. interests,"" FBI spokeswoman Ari Dekofsky said in a statement. ""We are not in a position to provide further comment at this time."" In the video, Kilajian identifies himself in the video as ""Wino"" from the Westside Armenian Power gang. Wino uploaded the video and photographs to his Facebook page, where he is identified as ""Wino Ayee Peeyakan"" and by his real name, Nerses Kilajyan, according to MEMRI. The video was also posted to YouTube. Island-hopping to safety: A family flees Syria . Syria submits revised plan for removing chemicals .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Families and friends of the more than 300 people killed in Russia's worst school massacre marked the fifth anniversary of the tragedy Tuesday. Mourners visit the Beslan school gymnasium on the fifth anniversary of the massacre. At exactly 9:15 a.m., a bell rang out over the city of Beslan and the remnants of School Number 1, where 32 heavily armed militants took more than 1,200 people -- children, parents and teachers -- hostage on the first day of school in 2004. Russian television showed hundreds of people lined up at the school's gymnasium, where the hostages were herded. They brought flowers, toys and water bottles -- symbolizing the water the captives were denied. Dozens of pictures of slain pupils lined the walls. The militants demanded that Russia withdraw from the breakaway republic of Chechnya. For three days, the world watched as Russian special forces took up positions around the school and town, and parents of students inside the building waited behind barricades, hopeful for a happy ending to the ordeal. But for many, there was none. Five years later, criticism still swirls about how the government has handled the investigation of the attack. Officials say a militant set off a bomb on the third day of the siege, prompting special forces to respond with a barrage of gunfire. Killed in the crossfire were 334 people -- more than 180 of them children. However, some relatives of the victims, as well as human rights organizations, say the bloodshed began with a government sniper firing at a militant. The only known attacker to survive was Nur-Pashi Kulayev, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2006. In an address Tuesday marking the first day of the school year, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev made no mention of the Beslan massacre. Just one more sign, critics say, that the government has left the tragedy in the past. Coverage of the anniversary was also overshadowed by media attention to the 70th anniversary of the beginning of World War II. But relatives of the Beslan massacre victims are still searching for answers, and asking if anything has changed in the still-restive North Caucuses.","32 militants took more than 1,200 people hostage at the school in 2004 .

"London (CNN) -- It may look more amusement park than Olympic Park, but the twisting red metal tower at the heart of the London 2012 Games site is no helter-skelter -- it's a massive piece of contemporary art named the Orbit. The sculpture, created by artist Anish Kapoor and designer Cecil Balmond, has become a common sight on televisions across the globe in recent days, snaking up through the sky alongside the Olympic Stadium. But while many visitors to the park have been happy to study the swirling structure from the ground, or to ride to the top and enjoy the sweeping views it offers across London, others aren't so sure. ""I think it's amazing, it looks like a roller coaster,"" Raven, an 11-year-old local schoolgirl, told CNN on her first visit to the tower. ""It's so ugly it becomes interesting,"" another Olympics fan said this week after visiting the sculpture. Earlier this year when the Orbit was first unveiled, London's mayor claimed it was better than the Eiffel Tower. Boris Johnson said the artwork, which rises up next to the Olympic Stadium at Stratford in the city's East End was ""a masterpiece of design and engineering."" ""It endlessly repays the viewer, it is a very rewarding thing to look at. The Eiffel Tower is very simple, the Shard, behind me, is a piece of cake -- any child of two could do that -- this is much more elaborate, more sophisticated, more intriguing and complex,"" he told CNN. The tower stands 114.5 meters (375 feet) tall, making it Britain's biggest sculpture, more than twice the height of Nelson's Column, almost six times the height of the Angel of the North, and 22 meters taller than the Statue of Liberty. Visitors climb 455 steps -- or ride one of two elevators -- to two observation decks offering expansive vistas across London. Johnson and Lakshmi Mittal, CEO of steelmaker ArcelorMittal, joined forces to champion the creation of a large-scale sculpture at the Olympic Park -- after meeting in a cloakroom at Davos. ""It started as a small project, a casual discussion."" Mittal told CNN in May. ""It was just a scribble on a piece of paper. But it expanded and expanded into this exciting project."" Mittal's company stumped up more than £19 million ($30 million) of the £24 million cost of the structure, providing steel from their plants across the globe. ""The Olympics are a global games -- the whole world participates, 202 countries. ArcelorMittal has businesses in so many countries around the world and so I wanted every one to participate,"" he said. Kapoor and Balmond won a competition to design the piece, and have watched it rise from the one-time wasteland, as the Olympic venues around it have also taken shape. Kapoor said the initial brief called for a tower on the Olympic site, ""100 meters tall, or more, and we've done more,"" explaining that the work ""questions the concept of what towers can be."" ""As you walk up, around and through it, it's as if the object is happening around you,"" he said when the sculpture was completed, adding that the Orbit ""demands, requires, needs public participation."" ""It's all about being here, being involved,"" he told CNN. The artist conceded that the £15 entry fee (£7 for children) was high, but said it had been an expensive project, and that he hoped it would eventually be free, allowing more people to visit. Designer Balmond said the pair intended the sculpture to last far longer than the few weeks of the Olympic Games. ""We hope it will be a monument for London, that will stand for 50 years -- though it might need a paint job by then -- and that it will be a beacon, drawing people to the area."" Kapoor said he was ready for criticism: ""When you add such a big edifice to London's skyline, necessarily, people will scrutinize it, and some will be critical, and that's part of the process. We will see...""","Orbit, designed by Anish Kapoor and Cecil Balmond, at heart of Olympic Park .

"(CNN) -- As leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa convene in Durban, the term ""BRICS"" used to describe these rapidly growing economies is so last year; today everyone is talking about the ""CIVETS."" Made up of Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa -- these nations, some with sizable populations and others with a wealth of natural resources, could be the economic boomers of the next decade, according to John Bowler, director of Country Risk Service at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Although unlikely to rival the economic might of India and China or the resources of Russia and Brazil, this motley crew of emerging markets make the CIVETS the next band of countries to profit from a shift in global power. Bowler highlights oil-rich Indonesia as a growth story for the next decade in particular. With low levels of public debt and a population of more than 200 million people, the Southeast Asian nation posted growth of 6% in 2012, at a time when economic giants such as China and India slowed. ""Indonesia is a low-cost location so it's attracting investment that would have previously gone into China but because of wage demands that investment is going into Indonesia,"" he said. Bowler also noted that Egypt has high growth potential despite trying to secure a critical $4.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. The country is mired in political turmoil following the outbreak of the Arab Spring two years ago, with Egyptian opposition politician Mohamed ElBaradei labelling the North African nation a ""failed state"" as the country remains divided over controversial President Mohamed Morsy. ""Eventually Egypt will modernize and follow the kind of path that Turkey has in reconciling its issues in society,"" Bowler added. Other members of the CIVETS -- Colombia, Turkey and Vietnam -- all saw growth of more than 3% for 2012, according to IMF data, well above the U.S., U.K., Germany and the debt-ridden ""PIGS"" of Europe; Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain. Bowler told CNN: ""Turkey is an exciting emerging market and Colombia will continue to do well over the coming decade with good demographics and rich, diverse resources even though it has had problems with militia."" One other country that may take the world by surprise is Myanmar, also known as Burma. The IMF is forecasting rapid growth of 6.3% this year for Myanmar, as the country emerges from decades of military repression. Bowler said that Myanmar, despite the recent unrest, will attract a large amount of foreign investment and is rich in gem stone and base metal resources. But Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill, the man who coined the BRICS term in 2001, said any club including China is going to be very difficult to match. He said the world's second-largest economy, in tandem with India, Russia, Brazil and South Africa, is still the big story for at least the next 10 years. O'Neill added: ""China creates another Cyprus every week, creates another South Africa every four months, has created another India in the past two years ... by the end of the decade the BRICS will have at least 25% of global GDP."" Leaders of the five economic powerhouses are in South Africa to thrash out a deal on a BRICS development bank, which will fund infrastructure ventures in developing nations; a venture that could be ""hugely significant"" for Africa, according to O'Neill. China, in particular, is seeking to increase its investments in the resource-rich continent. This week, newly installed President Xi Jinping made his first state visit to Africa, signing a $10 billion agreement to build a major port and industrial hub in Tanzania. ""It [the bank] is effectively going to replace what the World Bank's purpose has been for the BRIC countries and their friends,"" said O'Neill. O'Neill, who is set to step down from his role at Goldman Sachs later this year, forecasts that by 2035 the BRIC nations will be as big as the leading industrialized nations of the G7.","EIU's John Bowler sees Indonesia and Myanmar as burgeoning economies .

"(CNN) -- The St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, has become a national flashpoint in the debate over race, the use of force by police and militarization of police agencies. More than a week after Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, protests have been marred by confrontations with police, looting and violence. Here's what's next in this unfolding situation: . Attorney general to visit . Attorney General Eric Holder is expected to visit Ferguson on Wednesday to check in on the federal civil rights investigation into Brown's death. Some 50 FBI agents have been in Ferguson interviewing potential witnesses in an effort to determine whether any civil rights violations occurred in the August 9 shooting of Brown by Wilson, a white six-year police veteran. Grand jury . A grand jury has been seated and could begin hearing evidence in the case as soon as Wednesday, according to Ed McGee, a spokesman for the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's office. The grand jury will hear testimony from witnesses and decide whether to return an indictment against Wilson, McGee said Monday. Officials were working to line up witnesses but he wasn't sure if that would be done by Wednesday, he said. Protest changes? As police have before, city officials have asked for an end to nighttime protests in an effort to calm the violence. St. Louis Alderman Antonio French said he believed there was also some talk of trying to refocus the protests away from where Brown was shot, including the site of many protest conflicts, West Florissant Avenue. ""I think what's being discussed is trying to move a lot of these protests from West Florissant to more productive areas, taking this to, say, the county prosecutors office or downtown to the justice center is different,"" he said. ""That might be what we're doing through the next few days."" Why there are no dashcams in Ferguson . The police officer . Wilson, 28, who has six years on the force with no disciplinary issues on his record, is on paid administrative leave, authorities said. Whether he'll return to duty is uncertain. He would have to undergo two psychological evaluations first, authorities said. Law officials have described Wilson as ""very shaken."" He was briefly taken to the hospital following the confrontation with Brown for treatment of an injury that left his face swollen, according to Jackson. ""He's devastated. He never intended for this to happen,"" Jackson said. ""He was a gentleman. A quiet officer. He is and has been an excellent police officer."" Who is Darren Wilson? Michael Brown's family . They've hired lawyers and expressed outrage at how the police have handled things, including Friday's simultaneous release of the officer's name and surveillance video from the day of the shooting that showed a man identified in police documents as Brown roughing up a convenience store clerk while purportedly stealing cigars. The family and critics of the department have accused police of trying to damage Brown's character. Jackson said he released both the officer's name and the video because the media requested it. Complete coverage of the Ferguson shooting and protests . The family has conceded their son wasn't ""a perfect kid,"" said family attorney Daryl Parks. The family and their attorneys, however, took strong exception to the department's actions. ""Michael Brown's family is beyond outraged at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piecemeal information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight,"" the family and their attorneys said in a statement. ""There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender,"" the statement said. 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . What about the community? Schools in Ferguson and two nearby districts -- Jennings and Riverview Gardens -- remained closed due to the ongoing violence, CNN affiliate KMOV reported Monday. With all the chaos, businesses have also been affected. More looting was reported overnight in the adjacent city of Dellwood. Several businesses have been ransacked, some burned. ""I know that people are upset, but is this the justice for Mike Brown?"" the owner of a looted store asked KMOV. The station showed bullet holes in the store's facade, broken windows and destruction inside. ""All the small businesses, now they're running them out, and then people will complain later on and say there are no businesses in their neighborhood,"" the owner said.

"(CNN) -- The investigation into the death of a college student who fell from a camera tower during a University of Notre Dame football practice will look at wind conditions and protocols, officials said. ""We need to make sure we understood all the dynamics that played throughout the day,"" said athletics director Jack Swarbrick, adding he expects the South Bend, Indiana, school to learn some lessons that might prevent a recurrence. The Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration will assist in the investigation, which will include a reconstruction of the accident. Notre Dame will hold a special Mass Thursday evening in memory of Declan Sullivan, 20, who died Wednesday afternoon when the scaffolding toppled in strong winds. Sullivan, a junior from Long Grove, Illinois, was filming the college's football team practice day as part of his job with the athletics department, the university said. ""Practice was normal. Plays were being conducted with no difficulty,"" said Swarbrick, who said he arrived at the practice field minutes before the incident. A sudden gust of wind sent up equipment and other material just before he heard the crash, Swarbrick said. The hydraulic scissor lift Sullivan was standing on fell over at the LaBar Practice Complex. He died shortly afterward, the school said. Winds were gusting up to 51 mph at the time of the accident, the National Weather Service said. ""No words can convey the shock and grief we all are experiencing,"" said the college president, the Rev. John Jenkins. He plans to preside over the Mass, which is scheduled to begin at 10 p.m. The university said it has made pastoral care and grief counseling available to students. ""Declan was a well-liked, bright and enthusiastic film and marketing student, and a valued member of the Notre Dame family."" The university decided that Saturday's home game against Tulsa University will go on, but a Friday pep rally has been canceled. ""It's an opportunity to honor Declan,"" Swarbrick said of the game.

"(CNN) -- A top drug lord has been gunned down in Mexico after two days of shootouts between armed forces and members of a criminal organization, a national security spokesman said Friday. Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, also known as ""El Chayo"" or ""El Doctor"" was killed as part of an operation in the Mexican southwestern state of Michoacan, according to spokesman Alejandro Poire. Poire also said that members of the federal police, army, air force and navy participated in the joint operation centered in the city of Apatzingan and the surrounding mountainous region. Moreno was one of the main leaders and founders of the drug cartel known as ""La Familia Michoacana,"" according to Poire. ""This drug cartel began operations under the name of 'La Empresa' (The Enterprise) around the year 2000 and has terrorized the population in Michoacan ever since, not only trafficking and producing drugs, but also extorting, kidnapping, and murdering people,"" he said. The national security spokesman said that five federal police officers and three civilians have died during the joint operation, still under way as of Friday afternoon. He also said that three members of La Familia were killed and three others have been captured. ""During the retreat and escape of these criminals, they have been picking up those members of the criminal group who have been wounded and presumably died,"" said Poire, who said it is too soon to provide an accurate number of deaths and arrests. ""It's time to intensify the pressure on this organization in order to diminish crime in the (Michoacan) region in an efficient and permanent way,"" said Poire. He said the Mexican government is sending more armed forces to the conflict zone. La Familia's stronghold is in the state of Michoacan -- also the home state of Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who sent thousands of federal troops there after declaring a crackdown on cartels at the beginning of his presidency. Gunfire from high-powered weapons greeted police when the operation began Wednesday, Poire said. From there, the violence escalated. Two minors were killed during the operation, when gunmen shot at civilian cars and later used the vehicles as barricades, Poire said Thursday. Nearby, suspected members of the cartel set trucks and buses ablaze on highways to block approaching federal police.","Nazario Moreno Gonzalez was a key leader of ""La Familia Michoacana""

"(CNN) -- ""7th Heaven"" star Stephen Collins has admitted to inappropriate sexual contact with three female minors, People reports. The actor released a statement to the publication in light of child molestation accusations that arose in the midst of his divorce proceedings. Collins was the subject of reports in October after his wife, Faye Grant, said he admitted to her he molested three underage girls. TMZ posted an audio recording that was alleged to have been made during a November 2012 therapy session involving Collins and his wife during which he made incriminating statements. Stephen Collins' estranged wife says there's no extortion attempt . The incidents reportedly happened between 1973 and 1994. In the statement he released to People, Collins said ""I have not had an impulse to act out in any such way"" in the past 20 years. ""Forty years ago, I did something terribly wrong that I deeply regret,"" he says in the statement. ""I have been working to atone for it ever since. I've decided to address these issues publicly because two months ago, various news organizations published a recording made by my then-wife, Faye Grant, during a confidential marriage therapy session in January, 2012. This session was recorded without the therapist's or my knowledge or consent."" Collins was known for his clean-cut image in Hollywood and played a pastor and beloved father on the hit show ""7th Heaven."" He's avoided the limelight since the accusations were made public. Who is Stephen Collins? Now Collins is speaking out. ""On the recording, I described events that took place 20, 32, and 40 years ago,"" Collins says in his statement. ""The publication of the recording has resulted in assumptions and innuendos about what I did that go far beyond what actually occurred. As difficult as this is, I want people to know the truth."" Collins said he has struggled over whether to apologize directly to the women who were involved. ""I did have an opportunity to do so with one of the women, 15 years later,"" he says. ""I apologized and she was extraordinarily gracious. But after I learned in the course of my treatment that my being direct about such matters could actually make things worse for them by opening old wounds, I have not approached the other two women, one of whom is now in her 50s and the other in her 30s."" In addition to the lengthy statement that People will publish in its issue Friday, the 67-year-old actor is scheduled for an interview with Yahoo Global news anchor Katie Couric that will be streamed on that site and aired on ABC's ""20/20.""

"(CNN) -- The diapered child is bombarded with obscenities and racial slurs by the adults around him. The African-American toddler knocks down a chair and gives nearly as good as he gets, responding to some of the comments with an upraised middle finger and telling one of the adults at one point, ""Shut up, bitch."" The adults laugh and prompt him to repeat other crudities. Just another day on the Internet -- until the police union in Omaha, Nebraska, posted the clip on its website to highlight what it called the ""cycle of violence and thuggery"" the community faces. Now, the Omaha Police Officers' Association is under fire from the city's police chief, the ACLU and at least one community leader. They say the move needlessly antagonizes the city's minority communities, who make up about a quarter of Omaha's 409,000 residents. Sgt. John Wells, the union's president, said the video was ""disturbing"" and ""offensive."" ""The focus here isn't on any particular ethnic group. The focus here is on the troubling behavior towards this child,"" Wells said. ""This behavior is going to potentially lead this child down a path that is completely unhealthy."" On the website where the video is hosted, the union said the clip came from ""a local thug's public Facebook page."" ""We here at OmahaPOA.com viewed the video and we knew that despite the fact that it is sickening, heartbreaking footage, we have an obligation to share it to continue to educate the law abiding public about the terrible cycle of violence and thuggery that some young innocent children find themselves helplessly trapped in,"" the police union wrote in a post accompanying the video. ""Now while we didn't see anything in this video that is blatantly 'illegal,' we sure did see a lot that is flat out immoral and completely unhealthy for this little child from a healthy upbringing standpoint,"" it added. Wells said one of the adults mentions a local street gang in the video. ""That is why when we talk about the culture, the criminal culture, that this is to try to break the cycle and deal with the culture of violence and the culture of gang activity,"" he said. But in a city where police officers' treatment of minorities led to lawsuits, criminal charges against two officers and the firings and reassignments of several others in the past year, critics say the video is poking at raw wounds. Willie Hamilton, president of the community activist group Black Men United, said the union ""crossed a line by doing this."" ""For them to take a video out of context -- a 2-year-old who doesn't have the brain capacity to know what's going on -- and to say that this child, because two adults acted inappropriately, is going to end up in a life of crime is totally inappropriate,"" Hamilton said. And the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, which filed an excessive-force suit against the Omaha Police Department on behalf of an African-American family on Monday, said the union's use of ""racially charged language"" was ""very disconcerting."" ""Officers should be working to build a culture where anyone feels comfortable calling law enforcement,"" ACLU of Nebraska Executive Director Becki Brenner said in a written statement. ""The manner in which the Officers Association has discussed this incident has done nothing but further erode community trust and reinforce the need for independent oversight, trainings, and other reforms."" Police Chief Todd Schmaderer tried to distance his agency from the controversy in a statement issued Tuesday, saying that the union's website and Facebook page are separate from those of the Omaha Police Department and that he has little authority over the public statements of union members. ""With that background and understanding, I want to make it explicit and clear that the views expressed on the OPOA Facebook page do not necessarily reflect the official stance of the Omaha Police Department,"" Schmaderer said. ""I strongly disagree with any postings that may cause a divide in our community or an obstacle to police community relations."" Hamilton said the statement was too little, too late. Schmaderer was speaking out only ""because this thing is on the Internet and went viral,"" he said. ""What do you think it's going to do about the trust level? You think we're going to call you and tell you anything? No. All this is doing is highlighting that."" Wells said union members have turned the video over to the department's child victim unit, which will work with child-welfare agencies to investigate the circumstances. He said the organization ""didn't think we'd get this big of a reaction."" ""Hopefully, the impact is, it gives law-abiding citizens what law enforcement deals with on a daily basis, and it sort of throws back the blinders that these type of problems are going on,"" he said. ""And we can have a very frank and open discussion on how to tackle these issues and come up with solutions.""

"London, England (CNN) -- A mystery bidder has paid $104.3 million for a piece of art in London, making it the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction. Alberto Giacometti's ""L'homme qui marche 1 (Walking Man 1)"" was sold in less than eight minutes to an anonymous telephone bidder during an auction at Sotheby's. The previous record for a piece of art sold at auction was $104.1 million for Pablo Picasso's ""Garcon a la Pipe."" ""We knew that there was going to be a lot of demand for this great piece of art, but we were really amazed,"" said Melanie Clore, deputy chairman of Sotheby's. ""We knew that this was an incredibly important and rare masterpiece and probably one of the most important sculptures of the 21st century."" Would you pay $104 million for the sculpture? The life-size bronze sculpture of a man was made in 1961 and was originally cast in an edition of six by the Swiss artist. It was a record-breaking night for the auction house, as another piece of art was sold for $43 million, making it the most ever paid for a landscape artwork. The painting by Gustav Klimt entitled ""Kirche in Cassone"" was purchased by another mystery buyer. It was the first time in decades that the Klimt painting became available to the public for auction. ""This is a painting that was never on the market and hidden away a long time ago,"" Clore said. ""It was stolen by the Nazis, finally returned to its rightful owners, and now we are lucky to have it come to the market. There was a real hunger and thirst for something like this."" The night's auction had 39 works, and the total sale price was a staggering $235 million, making it the highest value sale ever staged in London. Read about the five most expensive pieces of art to go on the block . Bidding came from 30 countries, and the majority of the buyers were anonymous.

"(CNN) -- Three more Asia-Pacific based airlines have announced plans to ban shark's fin cargo from their flights. Fiji's national carrier and South Korea's Asiana and Korean Air are the latest to promise to halt shipments of shark fin and shark-related products from unsustainable and unverified sources. Acting CEO of Air Pacific -- soon to rebrand as Fiji Airways -- says the move is the result of a month-long review of its freight policies relating to shark products. ""We believe a ban on the shipment of unsustainably sourced shark fins is the right thing to do, and have implemented this policy effective immediately,"" Aubrey Swift said in a statement released Monday. ""We will now work with conservation partners and the fishing industry to prepare and implement policies and processes that will ensure future shipments are sustainably sourced."" Shark finning thrives on Hong Kong rooftops . Korean Air made its announcement of the change in policy last week. ""Previously, Korean Air carried shark fin only under the condition that a valid CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) permit was fully obtained by the customer from the related national management authority,"" the airline said in a statement. ""However, recently there has been a series of global movements calling to ban the carriage of shark fins. In view of these movements and in order to support the global call of protecting endangered shark species, Korean Air has recently reviewed its policy to stop the carriage of shark fins."" Lee Hyomin, a spokesman from Korean Air rival Asiana, told CNN the airline has already banned shark fins from its flights as well. Success for anti-shark fin campaigns . The announcement by Air Pacific -- which in two days will officially relaunch as Fiji Airways -- comes in the wake of criticism of its earlier shark fin shipments to Hong Kong, the world's biggest market for the controversial product. Campaigns highlighting the cruelty and devastation stemming from the practice continue to gather pace in the region. Approximately 72 million sharks are killed each year and 10,000 tons of fins are traded through Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific bans shark's fin cargo flights . ""Bans such as the ones taken by the airlines are an important step in the right direction,"" Ran Elfassy, director of Hong Kong-based Shark Rescue, told CNN. ""The supply chain of shark products involves many players and the chances are good that traders will move to other carriers. But each disruption adds inefficiency and added cost to the transport, hopefully adding strong pressure to end the trade."" Prominent hotels and restaurants in the city have been publicly striking shark fin from their menus, while Hong Kong's main carrier Cathay Pacific also announced a ban on shark's fin cargo last September. Shark Rescue's Elfassy says the impact of these large companies stepping up to ban shark fin is huge. ""When hotels like the Peninsula or airlines like Cathay Pacific take a stand to do what's right, it sends a message that being socially responsible is good business,"" he says. ""It also means these organizations who reach millions of customers every year can be major contributors for doing good. Moreover, it validates what the grassroots groups have been saying all along."" Last month, Air New Zealand also agreed to stop flying shipments of shark fin to Hong Kong. The decision came about after the New Zealand Shark Alliance revealed the airline's shipments in local media. ""Air New Zealand has taken the decision to suspend the carriage of shark fins while we undertake a review of the issue,"" Air New Zealand spokesperson Andrew Aitken told CNN last month. Though such bans prove that the issue is taking root not just at the dinner table but also in boardrooms, more governments in Asia need to follow suit says Jerry McLean, director and co-founder of the Hong Kong Shark Foundation. ""Consumers' attitudes are shifting against consuming shark products and many states have banned it including Brunei,"" he tells CNN. ""Asia's governments need to step up and echo the attitudes of their populace. Hong Kong plays a crucial role in this, as it accounts for a little over 50% of the global trade. But so far Hong Kong hasn't even followed China in banning it at government banquets."" Peninsula Hotels group bans shark's fin from menus .

"(CNN) -- ""About 20"" cases of a polio-like syndrome have been identified in California children over the past 18 months, a Stanford University researcher says. Dr. Keith Van Haren, a pediatric neurologist at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, has written a report about five of the early cases. In that report, which will be presented in April at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting, neurologists said they had identified five patients who developed paralysis in one or more of their limbs between August 2012 and July 2013. All five children had been vaccinated against the poliovirus. Treatment did not seem to help the children regain their motor function. Samples from two of those children tested positive for enterovirus 68, a rare virus that has been linked to severe respiratory illness in the past. Samples from the other three children were not collected or tested soon enough to yield conclusive results, said Dr. Emmanuelle Waubant, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco. ""About 20 cases have been identified in the U.S. so far, all in California, and all occurring in the past 18 months,"" Van Haren said in an online posting Monday on the hospital's website. Sofia Jarvis is one of the children affected. Her mother, Jessica Tomei, told reporters Monday night the family is speaking out to raise awareness of the condition. Sofia experienced what doctors thought was asthma and spent four days in the hospital, her mother said. As the family was leaving a follow-up pediatrician visit, Sofia reached for a toy out of the doctor's ""treasure box."" ""I saw her left hand, mid-grasp, stop working,"" her mother said. ""We did not realize what we were in store for,"" Tomei said. Sofia, who had received a polio vaccination, had spinal cord inflammation, and her left arm is permanently paralyzed. The paralysis surfaced at age 2, according to Stanford. Sofia is now 4. Today, she is doing well, Tomei said, but trying to tie her shoes or get dressed -- things she ""would normally be learning, we're going to have to find a new way of doing."" Waubant and her colleagues are asking health care providers to be on the lookout for similar cases and send in samples from any patient exhibiting these symptoms. ""We want to temper the concern because, at the moment, it does not appear to represent a major epidemic but only a very rare phenomenon,"" Van Haren said. Van Haren and Waubant spoke with reporters Monday night, and Van Haren said that although they have found five cases, there are ""preliminary reports of several more."" In the cases, he said, children experience a ""sudden onset of flaccid weakness that can occur over the course of hours,"" affecting one or more limbs. ""The prognosis that we've seen so far is not good,"" he said. Most of the children have not recovered use of the most severely affected limb, although some recovery has been seen in less-affected limbs. The condition is associated with ""severe weakness,"" Waubant said. ""It's not just dropping a toy; it's more like not being able to move your arm at all."" Polio-like illness found in five California children . Dr. Carol Glaser, chief of the Encephalitis and Special Investigation Section at the California Department of Public Health, said the state is aware of the paralysis cases but believes the risk to families is low. ""We are evaluating cases as they are reported to us,"" Glaser said in an e-mail to CNN. ""We have not found anything at this point that raises any public health concerns."" The department ""is taking these reports very seriously,"" Van Haren said. The phenomenon, he added, is not entirely new, as similar outbreaks have been seen across the world. The poliovirus has been eradicated in the United States for more than 30 years. Only three countries in the world are not yet free of the disease: Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria, according to the World Health Organization. Why polio hasn't gone away yet . Poliovirus is part of the Picornaviridae family, which also includes enteroviruses and rhinoviruses (better known as the common cold). There are more than 100 types of enterovirus that cause 10 million to 15 million infections in the United States each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most people who become infected with an enterovirus do not get sick or experience only mild symptoms, said Dr. Steven Oberste, chief of the Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch at the CDC. Common symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough, skin rash and body aches. Enterovirus is often the cause of ""summer colds,"" whose cases spike in July, August and September. Children and teens are more likely to fall ill because they have not yet built up immunity to these common viruses. However, some types of enterovirus are more serious. These can cause hand, foot and mouth disease; viral meningitis; encephalitis (inflammation of the brain); an infection of the heart; and paralysis in some patients. Enterovirus 68 was first identified in a California lab in 1962 after four children came down with a severe respiratory illness. Between 1970 and 2005, only 26 cases of enterovirus 68 in the United States were reported to the CDC. Since 2000, the government agency has kept a closer watch and has seen 47 cases, Oberste said. Outbreaks have occurred over the years in Asia and Europe, but it's still one of the rarest types of enterovirus. More common -- and more concerning to health officials -- is enterovirus 71, which was discovered by the same California lab in 1969, Oberste said. Enterovirus 71 is usually associated with severe neurological issues, including aseptic meningitis, polio-like paralysis and encephalitis. Waubant is not sure if the samples from this latest group of patients were tested for enterovirus 71. According to a CDC report, several outbreaks of paralysis caused by enterovirus 71 were seen in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, fatal encephalitis was a big problem in Malaysia and Taiwan. ""Ever since then, the virus has circulated in high levels in Southeast Asia,"" Oberste said. In recent years, the outbreaks have spread to Australia; a cluster of cases near Sydney drew media attention in 2013. Between 1983 and 2005, 270 cases of enterovirus 71 were reported in the United States. But none has resulted in a larger outbreak despite the infectious nature of the virus. ""That's the really odd thing,"" Oberste said. ""We see cases from time to time in the United States. Occasionally they'll be severe. Basically it's identical to what's circulating in Asia ... but it doesn't cause the same big outbreak in disease. And we really don't know why."" The CDC is aware of the small cluster of cases in California but is not actively involved in an investigation, a spokesman told CNN. Waubant and her colleagues don't want to alarm anyone with their case report presentation; they're simply seeking help in finding the cause of these seemingly connected cases. Parents need to know that vaccination is key to preventing polio from returning to the United States, Glaser said. While there is no vaccine to protect you from a non-polio enterovirus, washing your hands frequently and avoiding close contact with others who are sick can help.","Neurologist: Cases don't seem to be ""a major epidemic but only a very rare phenomenon""

"London (CNN) -- South African double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius, who made headlines at the Olympics, set a world record on Saturday in London in defense of the first of his three Paralympic titles. On day three of the Games, he ran 21.30 in men's 200m-T44 title in the first round Saturday evening, easily besting other racers in his heat. The paralympic movement classifies events, using terms like T44, to group competitors based on their disability. His biggest threats in Sunday's gold-medal final will include Brazilian Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira, American sprinter Blake Leeper and South Africa's Arnu Fourie, based on their qualifying times. Pistorius, who uses carbon fiber prosthetic blades, made it to the semifinals of the individual 400-meter and the 400-meter relay final at the Olympics last month, running against able-bodied athletes. In the Paralympics, which are the also being held in London, Pistorius is also competing in the men's 100-meter-T44 (set for next Wednesday and Thursday) and the 400-meter-T44 (happening Friday and Saturday), both of which he won in Beijing four years ago. He's also part of South Africa's 4 X 100-meter T42/T46 relay team, which is scheduled to race Wednesday. The thin line: Paralympic classification . Competition was intense Saturday in Paralympic competitions in and around Great Britain's capital, with 49 gold medals on the line across seven sports, including athletics, track cycling, swimming and equestrian. Britain's Richard Whitehead sprinted to victory earlier Saturday in the men's 200m - T42, setting a new world record in the process and shedding tears of joy at the finish. Team USA's Shaquille Vance took the silver medal. There was also drama in the velodrome Saturday. Britain's Neil Fachie, piloted by Barney Storey, smashed the world record to earn gold in the men's individual B 1-kilometer time trial, an event on a tandem bicycle for the visually impaired. There was bitter disappointment, though, for the cyclist whose record he took. World champion and fellow Briton Anthony Kappes, piloted by Craig Maclean, had his medal hopes dashed after the chain on their bike failed twice. Britain's Sarah Storey, wife of Barney Storey, made it a double gold for the household Saturday with victory in the women's individual C4-5 500-meter time trial, while U.S. cyclist Jennifer Schuble took silver. The win gave Sarah Storey, who was born without a functioning left hand, her second gold of the Games and an impressive 20 Paralympic medals in total across the swimming and cycling disciplines. She has also competed successfully against able-bodied athletes. Gold medal in the men's individual C4 cycling pursuit went to Carol-Eduard Novak from Romania, with silver for Jiri Jezek of the Czech Republic. Britain's Jody Cundy took bronze, a day after he was disqualified for a false start in the time trial. Australian world champion Michael Gallagher won the men's individual C5 pursuit, holding Britain's Jon-Allan Butterworth, a military veteran who lost an arm to a rocket attack in Iraq five years ago, to second place. China's Yin He set a world record in the women's C1-2-3 500-meter time trial to take gold. There is a tense wait ahead for Team USA's 17-year-old Victoria Arlen, who earlier this week was ruled ineligible to swim at the Games by the International Paralympic Committee. Arlen's appeal against the ruling was upheld Thursday, meaning she could swim in Saturday's 400-meter freestyle heats -- winning hers by a convincing 19-second margin -- but her classification is still subject to review by the IPC. British medal hope Ellie Simmonds, also 17, won her heat in a time a fraction faster than Arlen, the world record holder. That order held up in the finals, with Simmonds setting a world record in finishing a second ahead of Arlen -- with the two of them both 13 seconds faster than any other competitor. Arlen's classification problems came after fellow U.S. Paralympians Justin Zook and Mallory Weggeman were reclassified earlier this week. Arlen, from New Hampshire, was a talented able-bodied swimmer until a neurological disease left her paralyzed in both legs. The complex system of disability classification, which ensures athletes compete against those who are similarly-abled, is considered an essential tool for the Paralympic movement. On the track, the crowd gave a huge reception to Houssein Omar Hassan, who entered the Games on a wild card and is Djibouti's first Paralympic runner. He finished nearly 7 minutes behind the next slowest competitor in the 1,500-meter race but was applauded for his spirit in finishing. Over at Eton Manor, the first Paralympics-only venue to be built for the Games, the Netherlands' wheelchair tennis star Esther Vergeer is looking to extend her decade-long dominance of the sport. Vergeer -- who already has five Paralympic wheelchair tennis titles, three in singles, two in doubles -- beat Japan's Kanako Domori in straight sets in the first round of the women's singles. The rules for this competition are almost the same as for able-bodied tennis, but the ball is allowed to bounce twice. In another display of dominance, Nigeria took its fifth powerlifting medal of the Games on Saturday, compliments of Esther Oyema in the women's -48 kilograms competition. CNN's Tom McGowan contributed to this report.","NEW: South Africa's Oscar Pistorius sets a world record in a 200-meter semifinal heat .

"(CNN) -- They stepped forward to help reform the way football's world governing body FIFA operates - and are now bitterly regretting their decision. Two female whistle-blowers gave evidence to American lawyer Michael Garcia, who over 18 months investigated the bidding process of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The women claim Garcia ensured they would have anonymity in his investigative report -- and that he broke his promise. It's a report that has become mired in controversy after German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert -- FIFA's independent ethics adjudicator -- published a summary of the evidence the American had collated. ""Our cooperation was facilitated by Mr Garcia's repeated promises - made privately to us and also in public - to ensure the confidentiality of his witnesses,"" said Bonita Mersiades and Phaedra Al-Majid in a joint statement. ""He said the report would not be published; that only four people would see it; and that the identities of the people he spoke with -- other than current serving football officials or employees -- would remain confidential. ""This was a crucial element behind our decision to cooperate, as we are private citizens and no longer protected by the legal and PR functions of wealthy football federations."" Assurances . The two women insist that assurances were given to them both in private and public that they would not be compromised after agreeing to give evidence ""through a sense of natural justice and a desire to bring closure to a long running chapter in our lives."" The women were not identified by name, but they contend they were ""clearly identifiable"" in Eckert's summary. Garcia's office declined to respond to CNN's request for a response to the women's statement, while FIFA has said its disciplinary committee will investigate the duo's claims. Former head of corporate affairs in the Australia 2022 bid, Mersiades told CNN that Garcia - FIFA's independent ethics investigator -- made a verbal promise to her ""more than once"" that the report would not be published. In September Garcia said for the first time that his report should be made public with redactions. Soon after its publication, Garcia said the 42-page summary contained ""numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations."" According to FIFA, Garcia and Eckert are due to meet on Thursday to discuss their differences. The bidding process surrounding the 2018 and 2022 events has become a lightning rod for criticism of the way FIFA is run. The organization had hoped the report's publication would put in an end to the intensive scrutiny FIFA has faced. But Garcia's negative reaction to Eckert's summary and the two whistleblowers' subsequent complaints make that seem unlikely. In a statement, FIFA told CNN that ""any potential breach of confidentiality committed by a member of the FIFA Ethics Committee should be examined by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee."" It added: ""We cannot prejudice any decision that said Committee could take in this or any similar situation. However, names of witnesses have not been disclosed in the statement of the Chairman of the Adjudicatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee to protect their personality rights. ""Furthermore, the discussion and the public letter by Phaedra Al-Majid and Bonita Mersiades underline exactly the confidentiality issue concerning any of the witnesses when talking about a publishing of the full report."" Eckert's report cleared Russia and Qatar, who will stage the 2018 and 2022 events respectively, of wrongdoing and instead was critical of rival bidders England and Australia. However on Eckert's recommendation, FIFA lodged a criminal complaint with the Swiss judiciary on Tuesday in relation to bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups . Unmasked . Mersiades says she was not notified before the summary into the report was published, claiming the first she knew about it was last Friday after FIFA released the document. ""The summary by Judge Eckert clearly breached all such assurances of confidentiality,"" added the statement from Mersiades and Al-Majid, who was in charge of international media relations for the Qatar 2022 bid until 2010. ""Although not named in the report, we were clearly identifiable and within hours of its publication had been widely unmasked as the 'whistle-blowers' in German, British and Australian media. ""To compound this situation Judge Eckert used his summary report to question our credibility.

"(CNN) -- Former first lady Barbara Bush has been hospitalized in Houston, Texas, for treatment of a ""respiratory-related issue,"" a family spokesman said Tuesday. Bush, 88, was admitted Monday at Methodist Hospital, spokesman Jim McGrath said in a written statement. ""She is in great spirits, has already received visits from her husband and family, and is receiving fantastic care,"" the statement said. ""Updates will be issued when warranted."" CNN was first alerted to Bush's hospitalization by tweets from affiliate KPRC. Her husband, George H.W. Bush, was the 41st President of the United States. He also served as vice president for two terms under President Ronald Reagan. In her role as first lady, she championed the cause of literacy. She formed the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy in 1989. That was the same year that she acknowledged she had been diagnosed in 1988 with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disease that commonly affects the thyroid. In 2010, she was hospitalized for what doctors at the time described as a recurrence of Graves' disease. Bush underwent heart surgery in 2009 after doctors found hardening in one part of her aorta.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A new study by three universities shows that people holding positions of power with low status tend to demean others, one of the authors said. The research sheds light on why clerks can seem rude or even why the Abu Ghraib guards humiliated and tortured their prisoners, the researcher said. In an article to be published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, researchers studied the relationship between the status and the power of a job, said Nathanael Fast, assistant professor of management and organization at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business. The study, ""The Destructive Nature of Power without Status,"" determined that the combination of some authority and little perceived status can be toxic. ""We found that people who had high power and high status, they were pretty cool,"" Fast told CNN. ""But it was people who had power and lacked status who used their power to require other persons to engage in demeaning behavior."" In a field of study where psychologists and business schools are now jointly looking at how power shapes business relationships, the study's authors examined the notions of how low status is ""threatening and aversive"" and how power ""frees people to act on their internal states and feelings,"" the researchers say. ""The world was shocked when pictures circulated in 2004 showing low-ranking U.S. soldiers physically and sexually abusing prisoners from the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq,"" the study says. ""One could point to these examples as support for the popular idea that 'power corrupts.' ""However, we believe there is more to the story. Although it is true that the prison guards had power, it is equally true that their roles provided little to no respect and admiration in the eyes of others. They had power but they lacked status. We posit that understanding the combinations of these two variables â€” power and status â€” produces key insights into the causes of destructive and demeaning behavior,"" the study says. The researchers held experiments with students who were randomly assigned a high-status ""idea producer"" role or low-status ""worker"" role. The students were asked to select from a list of 10 activities for the others to perform. Five of the most demeaning commands were: Say ""I'm filthy"" five times, say ""I am not worthy"" five times, bark like a dog three times, state three negative personal traits and count backward from 500 in increments of seven. The least five demeaning activities were: Write a short essay on your experiences today, say a funny joke, clap hands 50 times, do five pushups, and jump up and down 10 times on one leg, the study said. The research found that ""individuals in high-power/low-status roles chose more demeaning activities for their partners (e.g., bark like a dog, say ""I am filthy"") than did those in any other combination of power and status roles."" ""Our findings indicate that the experience of having power without status, whether as a member of the military or a college student participating in an experiment, may be a catalyst for producing demeaning behaviors that can destroy relationships and impede goodwill,"" the study said. Remedies to such situations include upper management telling persons in high-power/low-status posts ""how important these roles are, so that they have status,"" Fast said. The promise of bonuses or promotions could also help, Fast said. But not all people in such posts are so disagreeable, he added. ""There are a lot of people in these roles who treat others well, and that's probably a function of personality,"" Fast added. ""I don't want everyone in these roles to say, 'Wait a minute, I don't act that way.' There are other moderators like personality and culture."" The study was also conducted by Nir Halevy, acting assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and Adam Galinsky, professor of management and organizations at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. ""It's important to study power and status because hierarchy is everywhere. You can't get away from it,"" Fast said. ""Whether you're with family and friends, volunteering at a soup kitchen, or working in a big organization, there's always a hierarchy.""","A new study looks at the relationship between status and power of a job .

"(CNN) -- Bolivian President Evo Morales is apologizing to the Jewish community in neighboring Argentina for having hosted the Iranian defense minister last month. Morales ""recognized he made a mistake,"" according to a statement posted Saturday on the website of the Argentine umbrella organization for the Jewish community, DAIA. The published apology came a day after Jewish leaders met with the president to discuss the case and other matters. The Iranian minister, Ahmad Vahidi, is wanted in Argentina for his alleged role in planning the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994 that killed 85 people. Bolivia's defense ministry had invited Vahidi to attend the inauguration of a military academy as a guest. Bolivia's president was also at the event. Interpol has issued a ""red notice"" for Vahidi, which seeks other governments' help in detaining him for possible extradition, and the DAIA demanded that Bolivia arrest him when they learned of his visit. Instead, Bolivian authorities asked Vahidi to leave the South American country immediately, which he did. Morales told the Jewish group that ""sincerely, I have to admit that this was undoubtedly a mistake."" At Friday's meeting, in addition to the Vahidi case, representatives from the DAIA and Morales also discussed international security, terrorism, Holocaust deniers, diplomacy and development. Vahidi's boss, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has in the past denied the existence of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of some 6 million Jews during World War II. He has also suggested Israel should be ""wiped off the map.""","Bolivia's invitation of Ahmad Vahidi was criticized by Jewish groups in Argentina .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Six roasted fetuses covered with gold for black magic rituals were found in a Bangkok hotel room, and the gruesome discovery led to the arrest of a British citizen Friday, Thai police said. Chow Hok Kuen, a 28-year-old Briton of Taiwanese origin, faces charges of hiding and covering dead bodies and a jail term of up to a year, police said. The arrest came after police were tipped off about a website advertising the sale of the fetuses. Police searched Chow's hotel room and found the fetuses packed in a box inside Chow's baggage, they said. Chow said that he planned to sell fetuses in Taiwan and that one could be worth up to 200,000 Thai baht, or $6,300, police said. He told police that the black magic rituals with fetuses are believed to bring good fortune for businesspeople. Police say it's unclear where the fetuses came from.

"(CNN) -- North Korea has rescinded its invitation for a U.S. envoy to visit the secretive nation to discuss the fate of Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American man who is being held there, a State Department official said Sunday. Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, was arrested in November 2012 in Rason, along North Korea's northeastern coast. Pyongyang sentenced him last year to 15 years of hard labor, accusing him of planning to bring down the government through religious activities. He is widely reported to have been carrying out Christian missionary work in North Korea. Bae, 45, operated a China-based company specializing in tours of North Korea, according to his family, who have described him as a devout Christian. No reason was given for the trip cancellation. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki expressed disappointment that Ambassador Robert King's visit was called off and noted North Korea had said it wouldn't use Bae as a ""political bargaining trip."" This is the second time North Korea has canceled a planned visit by King. Bae was moved to a hospital last year after his health deteriorated. But last week the United States said he had been moved back to a labor camp, a development his family described as ""devastating."" ""We again call on the DPRK to grant Bae special amnesty and immediate release as a humanitarian gesture so he may reunite with his family and seek medical care,"" Psaki said Sunday. ""We will continue to work actively to secure Mr. Bae's release."" The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the U.S. civil rights leader, has offered, at the request of Bae's family, to ""travel to Pyongyang on a humanitarian mission focused on Bae's release,"" Psaki added. She said that annual joint military exercises by U.S. and South Korean forces, due to begin later this month, are ""in no way linked to Mr. Bae's case."" Tensions over exercises . The large military drills anger the nuclear-armed North Korean regime, which says it views them as a prelude to an invasion. Last year, Pyongyang's threatening rhetoric reached alarming levels during the exercises, heightening tensions in the region. North Korea has been urging the South not to take part in the drills -- a call that Seoul and Washington have rejected. This year's exercises, involving thousands of U.S. and South Korean troops, will begin February 24, United States Forces Korea said Monday. One of the exercises, Key Resolve, in which about 5,200 U.S. troops will participate, will run until March 6. The U.S. military says Key Resolve makes sure forces are prepared to defend South Korea and trains them to ""respond to any potential event on the peninsula."" The other exercise, Foal Eagle, in which about 7,500 U.S. troops will take part, continues until April 18. Foal Eagle, according to the U.S. military, is ""a series of joint and combined field training exercises"" that combine ground, air, naval, expeditionary and special operations. United States Forces Korea said the North's Korean People's Army had been informed of the dates of the exercises and of ""the non-provocative nature of this training."" The dates of the drills overlap with planned reunions of families in North and South Korea who were separated by the Korean War in the 1950s. The reunions of about 200 people -- 100 from each country -- are scheduled to take place between February 20 and 25 at a resort on the North's side of the heavily militarized border. But Pyongyang said last week it may back out of the arrangement -- as it has in the past -- if South Korea goes ahead with the joint military drills with the United States.

"Washington (CNN) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday it would be an ""important step"" if Syria immediately surrendered its chemical weapons stockpiles to international control. ""But this cannot be another excuse for delay or obstruction. And Russia has to support the international community's efforts sincerely or be held to account,"" she said. A potential Democratic contender for president in 2016 who left the State Department in January, Clinton received questions and some criticism for not speaking out immediately after chemical weapons were allegedly used by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad last month. CNN Poll: Most Americans against U.S. strike on Syria . An aide said last week that she supported Obama's decision to seek congressional authorization to punish Syria militarily, but she had not publicly weighed in until her appearance at the White House on Monday. Her comments came during an address on wildlife trafficking and followed a meeting with Obama. She adhered to the White House line on Russia's proposal earlier in the day that Syria relinquish chemical weapons to international control to avert a possible U.S. military strike, which Obama is trying to get Congress to approve. Syria welcomed the proposal, paving the way for a possible diplomatic solution to the crisis that comes amid a two-year civil war in Syria that has killed more than 100,000 people, according to U.N. estimates. Clinton's successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, discussed a similar scenario, though the State Department stressed that al-Assad could not be trusted to give up his country's chemical stockpiles. And just moments before Clinton's remarks, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the ""credible threat"" of a U.S. military attack on Syria led to the Russian proposal. But he said any such plan would require close evaluation and that Washington remained ""highly skeptical"" of the Syrian regime. Clinton said Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons ""violates a universal norm at the heart of our global order"" and ""demands a strong response"" from the world led by the United States. House of Assad' survives on loyalty, brutality . ""This world will have to deal with this threat as swiftly and comprehensively as possible,"" she said. Clinton did not say whether military action, as proposed by Obama, would be the best course. But she emphasized she will support the president and argued a ""political solution that ends the conflict is in the interested of the United States."" She reiterated the White House's notion that Russia's proposal could have only taken place ""in the context of a credible military threat by the United States to keep pressure on the Syrian government."" Behind the scenes, Clinton worked the phones for Obama, who is trying to convince Congress to go along with his plan for a limited, targeted military response. Clinton, a former senator, called Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor over the weekend, a source familiar with the call confirmed to CNN. But Pryor had already made up his mind to vote against military action and announced his decision on Saturday. The source would not speak on the record because the phone call was private. A separate source familiar with the call confirmed Clinton also called Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, over the weekend. He already supported military authorization when the call took place. Clinton will likely repeat her White House comments during a speech Tuesday night at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, a Clinton source told CNN. In addition to pushing for diplomatic efforts to remove al-Assad from power, Clinton backed a proposal last year to provide weapons to Syrian rebels when she served as secretary of state. Clinton also issued warnings in January shortly before leaving office about Iran's involvement in Syria, saying the country was providing al-Assad's regime with military supplies. She urged Iran, as well as Russia, to reconsider their aid to the war-torn country. As Obama's top diplomat during his first term, Clinton was automatically associated with the administration's response to the Syrian civil war until she stepped down early this year. And she's faced some criticism for that response as debates over Syria heat up in Washington. ""Had President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acted then in support of pro-democracy forces when that rebellion was taking place, we could have removed Assad and helped usher in stability for that country,"" former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum said in a statement last week. ""But we have a very different situation today. After nearly two years, 100,000 people killed, a rebel force comprised of al Qaeda and a Syrian regime in a much stronger position, a military strike would no longer be in our national security interest,"" the former Pennsylvania lawmaker said. Santorum is considered a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Before leaving the State Department, Clinton defended her role in the situation. ""I've done what was possible to do,"" she told reporters. Kevin Bohn, Catherine E. Shoichet, Jessica Yellin and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Clinton says a ""credible military threat"" keeps pressure on Syria .

"(CNN) -- A veterinarian with a passion for elephants died Tuesday, apparently crushed to death in ""a tragic accident"" by one of the giant mammals he spent his life caring for, authorities said. Dr. Jim Laurita was the full-time caregiver for two elephants on his property in Hope, Maine. His rehabilitation facility and elephant ""educational destination"" was dubbed ""Hope Elephants."" Knox County Sheriff's deputies were called to the facility Tuesday morning after ""Dr. Laurita had fallen in the corral and struck his head on the cement floor"" as he tended to the elephants, according to Sheriff Donna Dennison.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden forcefully reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel during a speech Sunday before the general assembly of a major Jewish organization, telling the audience that ""the ties between our two countries are literally unbreakable."" Biden spoke at the Jewish Federations of North America annual gathering in New Orleans, Louisiana, after meeting for about an hour with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is scheduled to address the group Monday. Throughout the speech, Biden repeatedly stressed the strong relationship between the United States and Israel saying he feels ""absolutely certain that our support for Israel must continue ... forever."" He also downplayed reports of a rift in relations due in part to Israel's announcement in March while Biden was visiting the country that it was building 1,600 housing units in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as their capital. ""I can tell you -- and I'm sure he (Netanyahu) will tell you as well -- that the disagreements when they existed have only been tactical in nature, they have never been fundamental,"" Biden said. ""This administration represents an unbroken chain of American leaders who have understood this critical strategic relationship -- one in which we will not yield one single inch,"" he said, adding that President Barack Obama ""feels exactly the same way as I do."" Biden also threw his support behind the resumption of direct peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, which stalled in September when Israel failed to renew its freeze on Jewish settlement construction. ""While the United States will continue to do whatever we can to defend Israel's legitimacy, whenever and wherever it is questioned, we all know that the only true way for it to gain the long-term security it seeks and deserves is through genuine, secure peace with its neighbors,"" he said. ""There is no substitute for direct, face-to-face negotiations. He also cautioned both sides from taking unilateral actions ""that will prejudice the outcome of these negotiations."" Biden was apparently referring to comments made Thursday by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who said . there are options the Palestinians could pursue if the peace talks don't go forward. Those would include asking the United States to adopt a framework for peace and present it to both parties or go to the U.N. Security Council or General Assembly.

"(CNN) -- The spending bill which funds almost all of the government through September 30, 2015, has a lot of moving parts and special provisions. There's more money to fight Ebola and less money for the IRS. The District of Columbia is prohibited from legalizing marijuana. But the most important part -- and the most disturbing -- is the repeal of a banking regulation provision passed under the Dodd-Frank law after the financial and economic meltdown of 2008. In Washington, Wall Street is back in charge. And once Republicans get full control of Congress in January, they will relentlessly attack the financial regulations that help to prevent banks from putting the economy and taxpayers at risk. At first glance, the deleted regulatory provision is a little obscure. It prohibited banks from trading complex and risky financial instruments from within the bank's main corporate structure, requiring those risks to be taken from separate subsidiaries -- hence the name of the provision, the ""swap push out."" Such transactions were ""pushed out"" under the Dodd-Frank law so that insured deposits and access to the Federal Reserve's discount window wouldn't be tied to excessive risks. Under the Dodd-Frank provision, banks could still do their risky transactions -- they just couldn't back them up with taxpayer-insured deposits. The 2008 financial crisis was caused in part by banks bringing these risks into their core business models, putting the entire financial system in danger when the transactions all went belly up. The result was that taxpayers ended up paying billions of dollars to bail out the banks. Like other for-profit firms, banks take risks. That's fine. But banks are also the financial system in our society, and aggressive risk-taking can threaten not only their own profitability, but the entire economy. That's what we saw in 2007-2008, when the excessive and unreported risks taken by financial firms almost plunged the world into an economic collapse and kick-started the worst downturn since the Great Depression. But Wall Street is once again calling the tune, and Congress is dancing to it. The repeal of ""push out"" was accomplished with no committee hearings, no public testimony in favor or against, and no explicit votes on the provision. Unbelievably, the repeal provision was taken, in large part word for word, from a memo written by lobbyists for Citibank. A tweet from Rep. Mark Takano, D-California, highlights sentences that are identical, showing how eerily similar the two documents are. Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kansas, inserted the provision into the spending bill, with no debate or discussion. And when opponents got wind of it, banks pulled out the stops on lobbying. A source told Politico that Jamie Dimon, chairman of JPMorgan Chase, made calls directly to legislators to argue in favor of repeal of the ""push out"" rule. It was only back in 2012 that Dimon was defending $5.8 billion in losses from these types of risky transactions, in the ""London Whale"" scandal. JPMorgan Chase later admitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the company's traders may have been covering up -- in other words, lying about -- the extent of the losses. And now Dimon has asked for, and Congress has granted, a relaxation of the very regulations meant to protect taxpayers from having to pay for these kinds of risks. This victory for the financial industry reflects the sad fact that expensive lobbying works. In the recent election cycle, banks and other financial institutions have so far reported over $1.2 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions, which works out to just under $1.8 million a day, according to Forbes. Progressive Democrats and conservative tea party Republicans both attacked the deregulation, but the repeal passed anyway. The Obama administration went along with it because officials wanted an overall budget agreement, fearing they would get a worse deal when Republicans have control of Congress in 2015. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, noted that ""Democrats don't like Wall Street bailouts. Republicans don't like Wall Street bailouts. The American people are disgusted by Wall Street bailouts."" This repeal is testimony to how much power Wall Street has over Congress, and it sets the stage for more expensive future bailouts at the expense of taxpayers. In the next Congress, we will see full-fledged and well-funded attempts to gut much of the Dodd-Frank law, to the benefit of banks but to the detriment of consumers, taxpayers and small businesses. An unidentified senior Republican Senate aide told The Hill the latest rollback of regulation is one of ""the first cracks in the Dodd-Frank armor."" I would bet that many tea party supporters and advocates of small government didn't think they were voting to let big banks put the economy, and all taxpayers, at risk once more. But that's what a GOP-controlled Congress looks ready to do. This bad decision on the ""push out"" rule is likely the first shot in an all-out anti-regulatory war that will enrich the banks further. But it will put the rest of us -- Republican, Democrat and independent alike -- at greater economic risk.","Congress passed a spending bill that repealed a critical rule in the Dodd-Frank law .

"Washington (CNN) -- It might not have had the drama of a Sen. Ted Cruz overnight talk-a-thon, but some Senate Democrats hope their all-night effort draws similar attention to their issue that has been stalled in Congress: climate change. Mirroring a tactic employed by Cruz during his marathon effort aimed at derailing Obamacare, Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts read from Dr. Seuss during his turn speaking just before midnight Tuesday. He chose the children's book ""The Lorax,"" which touches on the environment. ""But now says the Once-ler, now that you're here, the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear. Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better,"" Markey read, then added his own thoughts: ""So to my colleagues here in the Senate and everyone watching and following tonight thank you for caring a whole awful lot."" Twenty-eight Dems participate . The effort by 28 Democratic senators was launched in part by Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse, who credits warming oceans for the state's disappearing idyllic and populated coastline. Whitehouse has spoken about the issue every week the Senate has been in session for the past two years, culminating in 60 speeches that have gone largely unnoticed by the public. He and fellow Democratic members of the climate change caucus hope their all-night session propels the issue back into the spotlight since it has been on the back burner for several years. ""There's a group of senators who have not given up on getting something done on climate change and aren't willing to just sit quietly through the current status quo,"" Whitehouse told CNN in a phone interview on Monday. After climate change legislation, one of President Barack Obama's top three priorities entering office, failed in 2010, the issue fell off the radar. The President rarely talked about it. Congress did little to address it. ""If you were looking for reassurance that somebody took this seriously in Washington, you weren't finding much,"" Whitehouse said. Why the renewed focus on climate change? The third rail . Climate change turned into an issue that few wanted to touch, especially those facing difficult reelection campaigns. When Democrats tried to pass legislation that would have capped carbon emissions, skepticism around climate change reached an all-time high. According to Gallup, 48% of respondents said the issue on its face is exaggerated. Opponents, led by organizations and businesses involved in the fossil fuel industry, successfully turned public opinion and stopped any efforts in its tracks. The death of climate change . Opponents successfully renamed cap and trade, which referred to legislation that placed limits on carbon emissions by power plants and other major polluters, to ""cap and tax."" Amid recession, they argued the proposal would kill jobs and raise energy prices. Key players in changing the dynamic of the debate were the Koch Brothers, billionaire businessmen who made their fortune in the oil and gas industry and have also spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to defeat Democrats. Cap and trade would have cut into Koch industries' revenue, which is estimated to hover around $100 billion per year. Tim Phillips, the President of Americans for Prosperity, the political organization backed by the Kochs, said that killing climate change legislation in a Democratic-controlled Washington was his organization's major accomplishment. ""Stopping cap and trade was a crucial policy victory that most folks would have thought impossible at the time,"" he said during a recent interview. ""Defeating that was an enormous policy victory that has lasting policy repercussions in a good way."" Not only did they kill the legislation, they successfully helped to elect a crop of new lawmakers who don't believe that human activity is the cause of global warming. According to the League of Conservation Voters, 100 lawmakers currently fall into their ranks. Whitehouse had this response: It's ""something that his grandchildren will be very ashamed of."" Opinion: Why are we still debating climate change? The top Republican in the Senate, Sen. Mitch McConnell, took to the floor Monday afternoon to deride the climate change talkers as ""cruel."" ""Families are losing work because of government attacks on the coal industry,"" McConnell said, referring to his home state of Kentucky. ""And tonight you're going to hear 30 hours of excuses from a group of people who think that's OK. Well it's not OK. It's cruel."" A revival? The death of cap and trade triggered new fears among environmentally friendly legislators. ""It is unfortunate,"" Whitehouse said. ""History will look back at the propaganda effort of the carbon polluters as one of the most sophisticated and complex propaganda efforts that human kind had to withstand."" But since then, the public has started to shift its opinion. According to Gallup, 41% now say that climate change is exaggerated -- 7 points lower than its high in 2010. And the number of those who say the seriousness of the issue is underestimated is on the rise. Now Whitehouse thinks it's his side's turn to make a move. He has buy in from the Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid who told reporters last week that it is ""the worst problem"" the world faces. But they have to start at Square One by working to convince the public that climate change is real. The Senate's all-night session is well-timed. Wealthy former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer is willing to spend Koch-like money to push the issue of climate change and defeat skeptics in the 2014 midterms. Whitehouse, who has known Steyer since college, said if he can make good on his pledge to infuse the effort with $100 million, he would ""help to neutralize an incredibly one-sided spending."" ""We can change the conversation very quickly."" The absentees . But not all Democrats - and no Republicans - are on board. Notable senators were absent from the overnight session Monday into Tuesday. They include those who have difficult election campaigns, including Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mark Begich of Alaska. Republicans aren't letting Landrieu's absence go unnoticed. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which aims to get Republicans elected to the Senate, put out a web video Tuesday, criticizing Landrieu for allowing the talk-a-thon to take place. The video also argues she doesn't stand up enough for American energy. Tiernan Sittenfeld, a senior vice president of the League of Conservation Voters, said the fact that just over half of the Democratic caucus is willing to speak in the wee hours of the night about climate change is ""incredibly exciting"" and ""good politics."" In fact, Whitehouse is working to ensure that climate change is a topic in the 2016 presidential race by traveling to Iowa next week to talk to voters and activists. He insists he is not running for President but wants to make sure those who do talk about the impact of climate change. Obama's engagement . After a hiatus post 2010, the Obama administration is also back in the climate change game. President Barack Obama proposed his Climate Action Plan this past summer that would create carbon pollution standards for power plants and expand renewable energy production. And in his new budget plan, the President proposed funding to study the impacts of climate change. Secretary of State John Kerry said last month that climate change is the ""greatest challenge of our generation."" Whitehouse is optimistic that the tide is turning. So much so that he traveled to Sea Island, Georgia, this past weekend to speak at the conservative American Enterprise Institute conference. ""I think it went pretty well,"" he said. Is it time to agree on climate change? CNN's Ted Barrett, Ashley Killough and Jonathan Helman contributed to this story.","Senate Democrats held all-night session to draw attention to climate change .

"Swat, Pakistan (CNN) -- Just over one week ago, Pakistani authorities paraded 11 children accused of terrorism in front of the local media. The boys, aged 10 to 16, were apprehended while attempting to plant home-made explosives on behalf of local militant groups operating in and around the city of Quetta, in Balochistan. The boys' arrest highlights Pakistan's worsening civil strife and underscores how Pakistani terrorist groups continue to exploit children. This is not a recent phenomenon. In fact, terrorist groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan are increasingly turning to children as operatives. A few weeks ago, my colleague Mia Bloom and I traveled to Pakistan's Swat Valley to see firsthand how the Pakistani government is working to solve this problem. Swat District includes the city of Mingora, part of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province which borders Afghanistan. This is the region where 14-year old Malala Yousafzai -- an activist for girls' education -- narrowly survived a Taliban assassination attempt last year. Renowned for its picturesque vistas, the Swat region fell victim to a brutal reign of terror by the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP in 2008. Faced with an emboldened TTP, Pakistan's national army launched an 18-month counterinsurgency campaign. Law and order were restored and the Taliban forced to retreat. An emerging success story -- and the reason for our visit to Swat -- is the establishment of ""Sabaoon."" From the Urdu meaning ""the first ray of light from the dawn"", Sabaoon is Pakistan's rehabilitation facility for child militants who were formerly recruited by the TTP. Some of these children were even prepared to become suicide bombers. Sabaoon's team of psychologists, social workers and military advisers share a principal objective -- to prevent recidivism and ensure that its 'graduates' don't return to the fight. Sabaoon joins a growing list of similar initiatives that have cropped up around the globe since the mid-2000s. Perhaps the best-known terrorist rehabilitation program is in Saudi Arabia. Read how a cagefighter in England de-radicalizes convicted terrorists . Collectively characterized as ""de-radicalization"" programs, it is more accurate to call them ""risk reduction"" initiatives. They represent a change in the way counterterrorism campaigns are waged, and share the goal of reducing the risk of re-engagement in terrorism once the program's graduates are allowed to return to their communities. So far, Sabaoon has had 188 'students' fully participate in its program of risk assessment and rehabilitation. All of the boys were captured by the army or police in raids on Pakistani Taliban training camps. The boys spend anywhere from six months to two years at Sabaoon. A few have spent as long as three years in rehabilitation. In Pakistan, the TTP showed no hesitation in their use of children for terrorism. In fact, ""recruitment"" is hardly the right word. It became clear from our conversations at Sabaoon that these children had little if any say in their induction. The younger children lacked the capability to refuse the terrorists, fearing their own safety or reprisals to their families. One mother explained to me that she had turned to the Taliban when she could no longer cope with her son's alcohol and drug abuse -- marijuana grows wild throughout Swat. Targeting children at risk like this provided the Taliban with a perfect opportunity to reach out to parents with an offer to help ""save"" their children. The militants promised a future involving discipline, belonging, purpose, and meaningful work. In some cases, families faced a horrible choice -- pay an enormous financial tax (double the annual wage) or surrender a child to the movement. Deception and manipulation have come to define the TTP's child induction practices such that the prevention of children's involvement in violent extremism in Pakistan can hardly be characterized as counterinsurgency. It is instead a challenge of basic child protection. Most of the children recalled overwhelmingly negative experiences at the training camps. After performing menial tasks, they were locked in a 4x5 meter room for the rest of the day. Some reported being repeatedly beaten, and in a few cases, sexually assaulted by senior figures. One child with whom we spent some time graduated from such deplorable conditions only to be 'allowed' to become a martyr, changing his mind literally at the last second. That boy is now one of Sabaoon's brightest hopes for successful rehabilitation and reintegration, and a potential role model for younger children at Sabaoon. But he remains profoundly traumatized by his experiences. Other children actually reported having had positive experiences with the TTP. Some became involved through family members already in the movement. For them, adventure, camaraderie, and a sense of purpose proved all too real. Terrorism was the family business, and even if the children didn't want to get involved, how could they refuse? Nobody knows exactly how old some of the children are. Many don't have birth certificates and don't know their own age themselves. Abdul (not his real name) is now about 17-18 years old. He is very soft-spoken and painfully shy, but spoke English very well. He has big brown eyes and a wonderful, broad smile. He was very thin, but so shy he wouldn't take the food offered to him at lunch. We were very sensitive to the trauma he had experienced at the hands of the terrorists. The staff briefed us about the abuse he endured. In our limited time with Abdul, we were careful not to ask him anything that might upset him so we focused only on speaking about his future, and how he has adapted to life after Sabaoon. Abdul is a great success story. One of the first graduates of the program, he excelled academically at Sabaoon. Shortly after his repatriation to his home village, he won a scholarship to university. He chose to defer his admission to take care of his mother and younger brother. He occasionally comes back to Sabaoon to visit the staff and also to talk to the younger students about how the program has changed his life. He is one of Sabaoon's role models. Although addressing the children's needs and reducing the risk of re-engagement in terrorism are Sabaoon's most pressing objectives, its staff are not unaware of the seemingly insurmountable obstacles that face the children when the leave the program. For Sabaoon, so far it appears that recidivism is not the problem, though with any such program, we may have to wait a bit longer to see if someone returns to the fight. No terrorism risk-reduction program has a 100% success rate, or even close to that. When such claims are made, it doesn't take long to realize that there are significant questions surrounding definitions and measurement of ""success"" or ""re-engagement."" Such questions need to be answered if programs like these are to be supported as creative approaches to counterterrorism. Knowing why they work is as important as knowing if they work. A few high profile instances of recidivism may spell the death-knell for such initiatives. As academic researchers who study violent extremism, we have a great deal of hope for such programs, and Sabaoon in particular has been the shining ray its name implies. Battling immense odds, Sabaoon's staff remain infectiously optimistic and dedicated, and that's one of the reasons we will return later this year. But time is not on their side. A few years ago, research conducted by Dr. Mia Bloom highlighted the changing nature of women's involvement in terrorism. Today a similar argument could be made for the involvement of young children. Both in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the child suicide bomber has come to represent a routine terrorist profile. Children are easier to manipulate, and like female operatives, they can penetrate security checkpoints without raising the normal levels of suspicions. A 2012 report from Afghanistan suggested that almost 100 would-be child suicide bombers had been 'intercepted' in the preceding 12-month period. Many of those boys were recruited in Quetta. What the rising tide of child militants means for the development of counter-terrorism initiatives, or even child protection, is unclear. Sabaoon alone will certainly not solve this problem, but it, and programs like it must continue to develop if we are to truly prevent the next generation of militants.","Center in Pakistan tries to rehabilitate children ready to be suicide bombers .

But the fear I felt about the possibility of airstrikes was put into perspective when I met 7-year-old Abdel in a Syrian refugee camp on the Lebanese border with Syria.

"(CNN) -- Police in upstate New York have finished their investigation into the death of Kevin Ward Jr., who died from his injuries after he was struck by a race car driven by Tony Stewart during a race in August. The Ontario County Office of Sheriff said in a news release that it had given the evidence it compiled to the district attorney. Stewart should find out soon if he will be charged. District Attorney R. Michael Tantillo will announce late next week what the the next steps in the case will be, the statement said. Stewart, a three-time NASCAR top series champion, was driving a dirt-track car when the right rear tire hit Ward, who was walking on the track during an Empire Super Sprints series race August 9 in Canandaigua, New York. Ward, 20, died of massive blunt trauma before paramedics could get him to a hospital. Ontario County Sheriff Philip C. Povero said several days after the incident that there was no evidence that a crime had been committed. One of the pieces of evidence gathered during the investigation was a forensic video enhancement done by the New York State Police Laboratory. There were at least two videos of the incident that police have obtained, but the release didn't say what the lab used for the enhancement. Stewart missed three NASCAR races after the incident. When he returned to racing at Atlanta, he gave a brief statement to the media. ""This has been one of the toughest tragedies I've ever had to deal with, both professionally and personally. And this is something that will definitely affect my life forever,"" Stewart said at the speedway in his first public appearance since Ward's death.

"(CNN) -- Cancer has surpassed heart disease to become the leading cause of death among Hispanics in the United States, according to an American Cancer Society report released Monday. Every three years since 2000, scientists at the cancer society have published Cancer Facts and Figures for Hispanics/Latinos. Such studies provide data that help develop an efficient science-based cancer control plan. Hispanics are the fastest growing demographic group in the United States. Approximately 16.3% of America's population (50.5 million out of 310 million people) is Hispanic. It is estimated that 112,800 people of Hispanic ethnicity will be diagnosed with cancer and 33,200 will die of the disease in 2012. The finding is due in part to the younger age distribution of Hispanics. Approximately one in 10 Hispanics is age 55 or over, compared to one in three non-Hispanics. Among non-Hispanic whites and African-Americans, heart disease remains the leading cause of death, according to Monday's American Cancer Society report, the fifth. While cancer is the most common cause of death for all three populations under the age of 85, there are fewer Hispanics in the United States over the age of 85, where heart disease is predominant. Overall cancer incidence and mortality rates are lower in Hispanics than in the non-Hispanic U.S. population, meaning Hispanics have a lower risk of cancer diagnosis and death. Hispanics do have higher diagnosis and death rates from cancers of the stomach, liver, cervix and gallbladder. There are a number of Hispanic subpopulations, each with a different ethnicity and culture. A weakness in the study of Hispanic cancer rates is the fact that much of the available U.S. data is an aggregate, masking important differences between Hispanic subpopulations according to country of origin. As better data for subpopulations are available, more efficient targeted prevention efforts might be possible. For example, it is known that Mexicans in the United States tend to have lower cancer rates than Puerto Ricans. On the other hand, Cubans in America tend to have higher cancer rates than Puerto Ricans. This is heavily driven by the fact that Cubans and Puerto Ricans have higher smoking rates than Mexicans. 'Selena' co-star Lupe Ontiveros dies at 69 . Intensive culturally sensitive anti-smoking efforts in Cuban and Puerto Rican communities could have a substantial impact. It is estimated that 63% of Hispanics in the United States are Mexican, 9.2% are Puerto Rican, 3.5% are Cuban and 2.8% are Dominican. The cancer death rate in Hispanics has been declining since 2000, one of the first years in which accurate Hispanic numbers were available. Cancer death rates for all Americans have been decreasing since 1991. Since 2000, the cancer incidence rate (risk of cancer diagnosis) declined by 1.75% per year among men and 0.3% per year among women. This compares with declines of 1% and .02% among non-Hispanic men and women, respectively. The cancer mortality rate (risk of cancer death) among Hispanics has also declined by 2.3% per year in men and 1.4% per year in women. This compares with declines of 1.5% and 1.3% among non-Hispanic men and women, respectively. The research indicates that cancer deaths can be prevented and lives saved among Hispanics if we increase use of proven cancer screening tests; make the hepatitis B and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine more widely available; and reduce tobacco use, alcohol consumption and obesity rates. Indeed, this message could be life-saving for all Americans. The triad of poor nutrition, lack of physical activity and obesity is the second leading cause of cancer in the United States, surpassed only by tobacco use. This triad is an especially significant problem among Hispanic women. Current data indicate that among Hispanics, 43% of women and 34% of men are obese. This compares with 33% of all women in the United States and 32% of all men. Stress, depression may affect cancer survival .","Hispanics are the fastest-growing demographic group in the United States .
There are important differences among Hispanic subpopulations .
More screening, less alcohol use and lower obesity rates would help reduce cancer deaths ."
"(CNN) -- Baseball scouts found Hank Aaron hitting cross-handed in Mobile, Alabama. They found Mickey Mantle outrunning the wind in northeast Oklahoma. They even found a former drug addict and felon turned outfielder, Ron LeFlore, in a Michigan state prison. ""We are very happy. This is a big opportunity,"" Rinku Singh says of his new job. The latest discoveries are from the countryside. The Indian countryside. Two pitchers, both as rural as hay, are now working for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel are the first baseball players from India to sign a professional baseball contract. They're entering pro baseball, a religious cult of its own with tobacco-spitting high priests, superstitions and unwritten rules of the clubhouse and the field . ""Sir, we are very excited,"" Singh said with stunning reverence compared with most American 19-year-olds. Baseball is a game that rewards fresh young arms that can throw with velocity. Patel is 19 years old, a muscular 5 feet, 11 inches tall and right-handed. Singh is 20 years old and a 6-foot-tall 180-pound lefthander.  Watch Singh and Patel discuss their new sport » . Both have thrown the ball past the vaunted 90 mile per hour mark on a radar gun. Their passage from India began with a reality show, ""The Million Dollar Arm"" competition, staged from Mumbai to Delhi. Los Angeles, California-based sports agent J.B. Bernstein got the idea that somewhere in a country of 1.1 billion people, they could find humans who could throw the ball 85 mph or better. The winner of the contest would get to come to America to learn how to pitch. For the Indian men, many meal-skipping poor, baseball represented a chance to throw their way out of poverty. More than 37,000 competitors crossed rivers, walked, rode, drove and bicycled over paved and unpaved roads and dirt paths. They pitched in all sorts of unconventional manners, often a hurl of the baseball in a modified cricket style. ""We even had a guy in Bangalore named Babu who drove a three-wheeler cab,"" Bernstein explained. ""He threw 81 miles per hour barefooted. He actually made it to a tie-breaker to qualify for the finals but ultimately was eliminated."" Singh and Patel, two former javelin throwers who picked up a baseball for the first time this year, changed their lives with throws faster than 85 mph. Goodbye to villages where their parents earn about $25 a week, hello to training in Los Angeles. ""The biggest surprise here, sir, is the rules of the road here,"" Patel said, alluding to India's dangerous driving. ""People respect safe driving here."" The young men arrived in the United States to work with a master, Tom House, the University of Southern California pitching coach. House has a Ph.D. in psychology, preaches pitcher-specific strength drills and taught Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson and other legends of the craft. ""The idea is that getting somebody brand new, with no bad habits, would be easier than trying to teach somebody to undo bad habits,"" House said. House adds that already, the pitchers are good mentally and physically. So House is teaching his pupils the art of deception, changing the speeds of their pitches, throwing to different locations: high and tight, low and outside. ""We have learned three pitches: breaking ball, fastball and change-up,"" Singh said. ""We are very happy. This is a big opportunity."" It's also high-voltage culture shock. Halloween with horrifying costumes, drunken revelry and women in various states of undress blew the minds of the Indian pitchers, both are Hindus raised on reverence and modesty. ""I couldn't believe the first time I saw Halloween here,"" Patel said in astonishment. ""I saw students in crazy costumes. People were going crazy."" House says his pupils will have to get used to the customs of baseball, from being asked to knock down a hitter with an inside pitch to knowing not to waste throwing a curveball on a three-ball, one-strike count when up by 10 runs. ""That's going to be their hardest adjustment,"" House said. ""It's going to be a cram course. They'll figure it out and probably have their feelings hurt or be confused early on."" But House predicts that the amiable pitchers will be embraced and soon learn about spitting sunflower seeds, or putting shaving cream in an unsuspecting teammate's cap. ""Baseball is a funny game,"" Patel said with a smile, flashing teeth as white as a newly unwrapped baseball. For the pitchers from India, the levity of baseball diamond got interrupted by the terror being played out on television as they watched the details of the recent Mumbai terrorist attacks on CNN. ""It is very sad,"" Singh said. ""We just pray for everyone in India."" The young men are back at home in India now, where they say they are fortunate that none of their loved ones was killed or hurt. Once they return, they will eventually wind up on the mound in Bradenton, Florida, for Pittsburgh Pirates spring training. When Singh and Patel face their first opponents off on some practice field, no doubt the echoes of Tom House will be heard. ""So you wanna throw hard,"" House urged. ""Think hard. Think hard thoughts."" The pitching guru will also steer them through those times when an ornery coach might live up to the Housian theory of baseball being a kid's game run by negative adults in a culture of misinformation. ""The really good thing is, they're not going to understand 90 percent of the negativity."" House said. ""My mom used to say ignorance is bliss. So their lack of understanding of the politics of the game will be a plus for them."" The Pirates players will also need to adjust to their teammates . Between games, Singh and Patel won't be eating cheeseburgers on the road, as cows are sacred to their Hindu beliefs. It's on to the world of pro baseball, sidestepping tobacco juice and the smell of new leather gloves. The baseball scouts have found two true country boys from India, who both have great arms and cows as pets.","Two young men sign contracts with Pittsburgh Pirates .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- The activities of the week-old BBC Persian TV channel are illegal, a top Iranian official said Wednesday, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. BBC says the news it broadcasts on the channel is gathered from abroad, using sources within Iran. The minister of culture and Islamic guidance, Mohammad Hossein Saffar Harandi, also banned Iranian journalists and artists from working for the channel. A BBC spokesman in London, England, said the corporation is breaking no laws in Iran. BBC Persian TV launched January 14, broadcasting in Farsi to Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan, the BBC spokesman said. It joins the 69-year-old BBC Persian radio service and the Web site BBCPersian.com, launched in 2001. The TV channel offers mixed programming, with news and current affairs for eight hours a day and documentaries and debates on arts, culture and science filling out the schedule, the spokesman said. Harandi did not say the BBC channel was breaking any laws in the remarks carried by Fars. ""Considering the BBC's history of creating chaos in Iran, and its efforts to set the various strata of Iranian society against each other, the presence of the BBC Persian TV in the Islamic Republic is deemed to be illegal,"" he said. Harandi added that various government officials had declared that cooperating with the channel would lead to problems for Iranian professionals, the news agency said. ""We are closely monitoring the English language BBC as well, which is working in Iran legally, and if they produce programs for the use of the BBC Persian TV, we shall then take action against them (BBC English),"" he said. ""And in that case, the country's security officials will respond appropriately."" The BBC spokesman said it is against the law for the channel to report and gather news in Iran, so the news it broadcasts on the channel is gathered from abroad, using sources and contacts within Iran. Correspondents for BBC Persian do not work in Iran, he added. ""We would like to have BBC Persian correspondents in Iran, and we continue to seek a dialogue with the Iranian authorities to get accreditation for that,"" said the spokesman, who asked not to be named. ""What we are doing is not illegal,"" he said. The Iranian minister's comments call to mind modern broadcasting folklore about the BBC's role in the Iranian revolution. A BBC Radio 4 documentary in 2005 said it had evidence that a radio newsreader inserted the word ""exactly"" into a midnight timecheck one summer night in 1953, a code word to the shah of Iran that Britain supported his plans for a coup. The shah had selected the word, the documentary said, and the BBC broadcast the word at the request of the government. Officially, the BBC has never acknowledged the code word plot. The BBC spokesman declined to comment on a possible connection. Harandi said the planning of the BBC Persian TV channel ""was not done with good will,"" Fars reported. The minister asked Iranian artists to obtain the proper permits for working with any foreign arts and cultural group, ""otherwise they shall have to accept responsibility for their cooperation with those foreign organizations,"" according to Fars. -- CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr in Tehran and Melissa Gray in London contributed to this report.","Iran also bans Iranian journalists and artists from working for the channel .

"(CNN) -- In a down economy, pursuing the American dream can be challenging, but restaurant owner Todd Steele was willing to take a chance. For nearly 20 years, Steele worked all levels of the restaurant game, from dishwasher to general manager, before partnering with his mom and opening his own eatery called Metrovino on Portland, Oregon's, 11th Avenue streetcar line. ""I would not have picked this spot if it weren't for the streetcar, and my business has certainly benefited from our location,"" Steele said. ""Streetcars are also a romantic way to travel, and they are fun to watch from inside Metrovino."" While America lost much of its love for streetcars as public transportation during the 1960s, a few cities have kept the romance burning. The heart of San Francisco includes its nearly 140-year-old electric cable car system. In New Orleans, the location for Tennessee Williams' ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" many tourists are drawn by the picturesque St. Charles Avenue Line. The Obama administration recently offered some U.S. cities a piece of a  $130 million federal fund for streetcar projects aimed at reducing traffic congestion, cutting pollution and reliance on foreign oil, and creating jobs. Transit systems in Dallas, St. Louis, Cincinnati and Charlotte, North Carolina, are slated to share grants from the Federal Transit Administration's Urban Circulator program. Other cities have plans and other funding for streetcar projects, too. See map for key projects . But not everyone is a fan of streetcars. ""This is a waste of money,"" said Ron Utt of The Heritage Foundation. ""Streetcars certainly create jobs, but they are a poor investment and create little lasting value,"" he said. ""Because it requires extensive ongoing subsidies, it is also unsustainable. Improving roads would be the better bet in most communities."" CNN iReporter Raymond Becich is a supporter. ""Sure, Portland paid incentives to businesses to build along the streetcar (line),"" he said. ""But how is this any different than any governmental jurisdiction giving tax breaks and other incentives for businesses to relocate to a city or state?"" Streetcars have transformed a ""blighted warehouse district ... into a vibrant area of shops, grocery stores, restaurants and apartments that provide entertainment and employment,"" he said. But there's nothing streetcars can do that buses can't do better, faster, safer and for far less money, said CATO Institute senior fellow Randal O'Toole. ""Even though a single light-rail train can hold more passengers than a bus, a bus route can move more passengers per hour than any light-rail line."" Portland's streetcar system attracts about 12,000 daily riders at an average ticket cost of $1.47. Its creators credit it with $3.5 billion in surrounding development, including shops, restaurants and 10,000 new housing units. Also, streetcars that run on either hydro or coal-generated electricity spit out less greenhouse gases per passenger mile than diesel buses, according to University of California researchers. So, what is a streetcar, exactly? The transportation community generally defines it as a rail-based passenger tram that shares streets with cars and trucks. Becich said he rides his city's system so often he's considering selling his car. ""Riding public transportation in Portland is quick, easy and enjoyable,"" he said. ""It's absolutely easier than driving, and streetcar operators go out of their way to be helpful."" But is it faster than driving? ""If you count the time from point A to B, it is slower to ride the streetcar,"" Becich said. ""But if you factor in time to find a place to park and the cost of parking, it is more convenient and cheaper to ride the streetcar."" It's no secret that public transit offers commuters an escape from hectic traffic and a chance to read, make phone calls or snooze. These transportation issues were recently at the heart of an $85 million question faced by leaders and residents of Fort Worth, Texas: Should they green-light a proposed three-mile streetcar line from LaGrave Field through downtown and into the near-south side? After much debate, city leaders decided ""no"" earlier this month ""because of the timing and questions regarding how it would be fully funded."" As many as 2,250 people were projected to use the system daily, according to a city study. Utt says that's not very many riders, considering the cost of building and maintaining the line. ""Most ridership projections are overly optimistic,"" he said. ""There are good reasons why most cities got rid of their trolley systems in the '50s and '60s."" Read state-by-state data on how commuters get to work . A federal transportation official acknowledged that ridership is often low, according to industry studies. In Michigan, supporters are working to bring a light-rail line to revitalize downtown Detroit, a city among the hardest hit by the recession. But on Capitol Hill, a House transportation committee spokesman acknowledged that there may be less federal money available for streetcar projects as Republicans prepare to take control of the House in January. Transportation blogger Yonah Freemark agreed. ""Based on recent decisions by party members at the state and national level, that will mean a renewed emphasis on roadway projects and less proposed funding for transit.""","Obama administration touts streetcars as a way to vitalize urban economies .

Just to watch her be honored for that, to get a thank you, that was awesome."" But you don't have to personally know the individual you nominate. Just be familiar with their work. Johanna Robinette, for example, lives in the same small town as Dale Beatty, who helps build and modify homes for injured veterans. Robinette had heard about Beatty's organization, and she saw nominating him as a way to help draw attention to his efforts. ""To be able to take that time to do that, I was thankful that I did and thankful that (he was) honored in that way,"" Robinette said. ""It felt great to be a part of that.""

"(CNN) -- Target knows when you get pregnant. Facebook knows when you break up with someone. Google knows when you have been in a car accident. These are all (terrifying) consequences of our increasing lack of privacy. They are also results of the ""big data"" revolution that's transforming our society. Whether you are a buyer, a seller or a hopeless romantic ""researching"" your old high school crush, chances are, some program is keeping track of all your clicks. This is what big data can do. By aggregating data from billions of people, analysts can predict what you are likely to do next. Given the degree to which Amazon and Facebook have crushed their competition, companies that do not take advantage of big data are doomed to obsolescence. Why then, with all the noise we hear about the rise of big data in consumerism, do we hear so little about big data in social justice? Is it not possible for big data to make the world a better place while making it creepier and less private? The short answer is that big data can make the world a fairer place. But there is less immediate financial gain to be made from it, and some of the science is still in progress. The biggest reason perhaps is that we fear what big data will tell us about our democracy. Racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination are still alive. If we collect data about disparities, we might see far more ugliness in our society. ""Measuring fairness"" is harder than it sounds. But big data can help us. For example, some police departments are leveraging big data innovations, like the use of CompStat. You know, the scenes in ""The Wire"" where people talk about ""bringing numbers down""? CompStat is a way of mapping crime in regions of a given city and measuring patterns of crime in those regions. It has become a popular method for holding police executives accountable for crime rates, and it seems to work. All kinds of information is captured through CompStat: type of crime, time of day, GPS coordinates of the incident and even the demographics (e.g., race, gender, age) of the suspect. Why, then, don't most police departments conduct CompStat for officer fairness? In part, it's because we don't know how to measure ""fairness."" Simply comparing the percentage of white suspects an officer stops to the percentage of whites in the neighborhood is a common but terrible metric. That is because, if whites commit disproportionately more (or less) crime than their representation in the neighborhood, then using the neighborhood as a benchmark will mislead us. This technique, called population benchmarking, is widely discredited by scholars and law enforcement alike. Comparing officers against each other makes it hard to tell whether all or none of the officers are engaged in biased policing, which troubles academics and civil liberties groups alike. And comparing officers in one district against officers in another is often an unfair comparison given that income -- and, often, crime -- varies widely across districts. So what is a police chief to do? The answer is, at least collect the data. Target can tell if you get pregnant because it has billions of data points about who buys what when. Hidden within the data are patterns of behavior -- the ""if this, then that"" logic -- that most of us do not recognize within our own decisions. This is how it recommends purchases to you. There are billions of police encounters across the country every year. When we start to aggregate the data, we can figure out how to ask better questions and get better answers. This year, my colleagues and I will begin collecting data for the nation's first database (PDF) tracking police stops and use of force. Using big data to analyze police behavior across the country is the first step in harnessing these powers to make our society fairer. Although this justice database will not end unfairness in policing, it might give us tangible benchmarks from which to work in our conversations about race in the U.S. And it will let us learn how to ask the right questions to reduce racial disparities. Just like Amazon was not remotely correct in thinking I might like Justin Bieber's new album because I liked ""Purple Rain,"" big data may need time to get it right. And although we must remain at least as vigilant over privacy concerns in law enforcement as we are over online shopping, it's time to leverage the big data revolution to start helping us achieve a fairer society.","Companies like Facebook, Target and Google track consumer behaviors .

"(CNN) -- Would you rather be sexy or smart? I hate that dumb question. Of course you'd rather be smart. Although just the other day, Debbie Sterling, a Stanford engineering graduate and successful entrepreneur, told me, ""Growing up as a little girl I was always very smart and I got good grades, but I always wanted people to tell me that I was pretty. Like to me that was the ultimate success."" Sexy sells. It can make you rich. And stunningly successful. It wasn't Kim's brain that launched the Kardashian empire. Wait -- I hear you: Kim is smart. She turned a sex tape into a hit reality TV show. She developed a cosmetics line. She tried to break the Internet. But it's not like Kim goes around urging little girls to use their brains. She is sending them a decidedly different kind of message. So, again, how would you answer -- sexy or smart? Eileen Pollack, who was one of the first women to earn a bachelor's degree in physics from Yale, is writing a book called ""The Only Woman in the Room: Why Science Is Still a Boy's Club."" It aims to expose factors that impact women's access to careers in science, technology, engineering and math -- the fields known collectively as STEM. She had this to say: ""First of all, that the question would even be asked -- I can see all the anxiety that it poses. Why is that even a question? Why isn't it assumed that they can be both? This isn't a critique of your question, because that question is the story of my life."" I can understand that. Pollack, as a Yale physics pioneer, isn't speaking to us from the grave, but from the heart. Why is it, she wonders, when girls reach the age of 6, brains take a back seat to beauty even if they have both? ""If it's your professor or employer, I guess you want to be smart,"" Pollack said. ""But not if there is a guy in the room. In America, nobody's boyfriend wants them to be smarter than he is, and no one wants to admit it."" Cue the tabloids. If Kim Kardashian really is smart, then why is her husband, music mogul Kanye West, now supposedly controlling her empire? Even if that's not true, the narrative exists and it says something about how girls may, in their heart of hearts, answer that question. Sterling and I talked about how to persuade more girls to skip the Kim/princess route and revel in their natural curiosity. It's why Sterling created her toy company, GoldieBlox. ""Growing up as a little girl, I certainly had no interest in becoming a scientist or mathematician or engineer,"" Sterling said. ""I thought it was a boys-only club for geniuses. And I pictured this old white man in a lab coat with no friends."" Goldie, the doll who rules the GoldieBlox world, isn't beautiful like Princess Anna, not sexy like Barbie, but brainy, curious and quirky, like Sterling herself. And when I say quirky, I don't mean like the brainy women on ""The Big Bang Theory."" I don't think many little girls clamor to be like Amy or Bernadette. Sexy wins the day on that show. Penny, a community college dropout, is incurious and kinda, well, dippy. But she is sexy. And she continually wins the sexy, brilliant male nerd: Leonard Hofstadter. Poor Bernadette is stuck with Howard, a man Penny once described as ""disgusting."" And Amy? Well ... I bring up ""The Big Bang Theory"" and lump it in with Kim Kardashian because both send a strong message to impressionable girls -- and to the rest of us. I'm not saying they are solely to blame for the Wiki-How site that instructs girls to be smart without being nerdy, but something in our culture is causing girls to tune out math and science. In many countries, girls now outperform boys in science, but not in the United States, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, reported by The New York Times. Sterling says that means ""it's a cultural issue in the United States rather than a gender one."" Just look at Fabiola Gianotti. She is a physicist from Milan, Italy. Gianotti was just elected to lead the most prestigious particle physics research center in the world, CERN. Or, as Vanity Fair describes it, a ""$9 billion cathedral of science"" that could unlock the secrets of the universe. ""I grew up in environment that had more women in science,"" Gianotti told me. When I asked her the sexy-smart question she sounded puzzled. ""I hope women and men in general value their brain. The brain is much more useful in life than beauty."" Interestingly, Gianotti sees physics in a decidedly feminine way. ""I like the beauty of physics,"" she told me. ""Nature is beautiful, it is my second soul to music."" When I asked her who inspired her, Gianotti did not hesitate. Marie Curie, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who researched radioactivity is her idol. ""She (Curie) had a domestic way of doing physics,"" Gianotti told me. ""She had a lab in her house. She could prepare dinner in her kitchen, then move into her lab. She could have a normal life. Really amazing."" Note Gianotti said ""a normal life."" That's important because American girls like normal. Pollack points to a 2010 American Mathematical Society study that determined why so few women in the United States became physicists, mathematicians or computer scientists to prove the point. One reason -- and I stress only one -- is that girls are not attracted to the ""asocial"" geek image associated with the sciences. They find the culture ""unsatisfying."" ""Parents don't want their kids to be nerdy,"" Pollack told me. ""For women, even if she's nerdy enough to be Steve Jobs, she's undateable."" See -- it all comes back to that not-so-easy question. ""There's still this Americanized version of being too smart in anything,"" Pollack continued. ""You have to look like a porn star in eighth grade. There's this huge obsession with romance, being a princess, a supermom."" Maybe Sterling's little Goldie doll, who actively maligns America's cultural definition of beauty in online videos, can help. In ""Goldie vs. the Big Sister Machine,"" a woman states: ""You are beauty and beauty is perfection."" Identically dressed little girls walk the ""runway"" as another little girl, in sneakers, blows that myth out of the water. As Sterling puts it, ""I was hoping that if girls looked at Goldie and they wanted to be like her and do what she does, they might value their brains as much as their beauty."" So, sexy or smart? Come on, ask your daughter which is more important. Then ask her why.","Carol Costello: When girls reach age of 6, why do brains take a back seat to beauty?
Costello: ""Big Bang Theory"" and Kim Kardashian send messages to girls about success .
Studies show across 65 countries girls outperformed boys in STEM fields .

"Editor's note: Campbell Brown anchors CNN's ""Campbell Brown: Election Center"" at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays. She delivered this commentary during the ""Cutting through the Bull"" segment of Monday night's broadcast. Campbell Brown says whoever wins should enter the White House with his dignity intact. NEW YORK (CNN) -- By now you've probably heard about how ugly things have gotten out there on the campaign trail in the last 48 hours. But we thought for just a moment we would take you back to kinder, gentler times. Remember this: . Sen. John McCain: I pledge again a respectful campaign. A respectful campaign based on the issues and based on the stark differences we have on the vision for the future of America. Sen. Barack Obama: I said I was looking forward to a civil substantive debate on the issues and he agreed. McCain: I've pledged to conduct a respectful campaign and I urge, time after time, various entities within the Republican party to also do that. Obama: We don't need John McCain and I to be demonizing each other. You won't get that from my campaign. Oh how far we have come in such a short period of time. To say, as Gov. Sarah Palin is now doing, that Barack Obama pals around with terrorists is just outrageous. But Obama's hands aren't clean either. Here is what he said in May of this year about McCain's involvement in the Keating Five, a savings and loan scandal that happened in the late 80s. iReport.com: Your hopes for next debate . Obama said, ""I don't think there is any doubt that John McCain's public record about issues that he's apologized for and written about is not germane to the presidency."" And yet this morning the Obama campaign released a mini-documentary, walking voters through all the details of the Keating Five -- making it very much germane. There is just one month left. Please, please don't let this devolve into a campaign you are sickened by and embarrassed to be part of. Here's a purely practical reason: The negativity you are spewing now will only make your job harder after Election Day. Bipartisanship is really tough to achieve when everyone on both sides is left with a bad bad taste in their mouths. Here is the new CNN Opinion Research Corp. When asked ""How are things going in the country today?"" 80 percent said badly. Eighty percent. Pollsters have been asking that question since 1974. Eighty percent is an all-time low. People want to hear solutions from you. They want to hear how you are going to get us out of this mess. One of you will have to. Don't you want to be able to walk into the White House with your dignity intact and your head held high?

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Iran poses a significant threat to Iraq, but security has greatly improved in the war-ravaged country, according to a Pentagon report. Iraqi soldiers parade in Kirkuk on January 10. The Pentagon credits better forces for improved security. The Pentagon assessed progress in Iraq from September to November in its quarterly report to Congress, issued on Tuesday. Iran ""continues to reflect a fundamental desire to oppose the development of a fully secure and stable Iraq,"" despite its ""persistent promises to the contrary,"" the report said. Iran tried to undermine the U.S.-Iraqi security agreement forged last year, the report said, and ""continues to host, train, fund, arm, and direct militant groups intent on destabilizing Iraq."" ""Countering malign influence and balancing soft Iranian influence remain priorities to stabilize Iraq and ensure the sovereignty of its people,"" the report said. The report cites improvements in politics, security, economics, diplomacy and rule of law, but emphasizes their fragility. ""Iraq remains fragile because its major power brokers do not share a unified national vision. They disagree on the nature of the state and are reluctant to share power and resources,"" it says. ""The overall security situation in Iraq continues to improve,"" the Pentagon report says, crediting, among other things, improved Iraqi security forces and the political will of the government to fight militants. It says the insurgency has diminished as some militants embrace the Iraqi government. The U.S.-led coalition has transferred security leadership to Iraqi forces in several provinces and coalition troops from many countries have withdrawn their forces. The United States and Iraq have signed a bilateral security agreement calling for all U.S. troops to leave by the end of 2011. Although the number of civilians killed has dropped, assassinations of juridical and legislative officials have increased and violence against Christians in Nineveh province has stirred concern. The report raises fears that the mishandling of key political efforts in the country could reverse gains. Crucial efforts include the upcoming provincial elections, resolving disputes over areas such as Kirkuk city; resettling displaced people; and providing permanent employment for the Sons of Iraq, the largely Sunni U.S.-backed security personnel.","Pentagon report assesses progress in Iraq from September to November .

"Washington (CNN) -- More than 50 members of a child pornography ring who engaged in what authorities describe as ""horrific"" and ""unspeakable"" crimes have been arrested for sexually exploiting children from 12 years old to as young as infants. Top federal law enforcement officials say agents busted the global online pornography ring following an intense international investigation that began in 2009. The ring, based in the United States, reached across five continents and 14 countries. Seventy-two members of the online site called Dreamboard have been charged in the United States. Officials said 52 of them have been arrested in the U.S. and abroad. The identities of the remaining 20 are unknown at this time. An additional 10 individuals were arrested abroad on charges from other countries. ""In order to become part of the Dreamboard community, prospective members were required to upload pornography portraying children under 12 years of age or younger,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder at a Justice Department news conference. ""Once given access, the participants had to continually upload images of child sexual abuse in order to maintain membership. The more content they provided, the more content they were allowed to access. Members who created and shared images and videos of themselves molesting children received elevated status and greater access,"" he said. What particularly horrified investigators were ""super-hardcore"" posts that involved adults having violent sexual intercourse with ""very young kids"" who were being subjected to both physical and sexual abuse. Holder said, ""Some of the children featured in these images and videos were just infants and in many cases, the children being victimized were in obvious and also intentional pain, even in distress and crying, just as the rules for one area of the bulletin board mandated. They had to be in distress and crying."" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said, ""To give you an example of the scope of this forum, the capture and analysis of the forum revealed that the board may have been the vehicle for the distribution of up to 123 terabytes of child pornography, which is roughly equivalent to nearly 16,000 DVDs. ... Additional media recovered from the targets arrested in the United States alone has been found to contain over one million images of child pornography."" About 600 men belonged to the members-only online bulletin board, which has now been taken down. Authorities said the site encouraged and rewarded members who sexually abused young children and made them cry. ""As alleged, Dreamboard had strict rules and a rigid hierarchy. Its membership was tightly controlled by the group's administrators,"" Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer told reporters. ""Applicants to the group were required to upload quote nude or hardcore child pornography to become members and members were required to continue posting additional images every 50 days or risk expulsion. Moreover, members could increase their status based on their level of commitment to the enterprise. From member, to VIP, to Super VIP, to the most elite status of all, Super VIP Dot. Only those members who produced their own child pornography could be granted the status of Super VIP Dot,"" Breuer explained. ""The members of this criminal network shared a demented dream to create the pre-eminent online community for the promotion of child sexual exploitation but for the children they victimized this was nothing short of a nightmare,"" Holder said. One Justice Department investigator who asked not to be identified because of the ongoing probe said, ""Dozens of young children were directly victimized,"" some of whom had been identified by agents working the case. Of the five ""administrators"" who managed the online community, one was arrested in Canada and another in France. The three others have not yet been identified by agents following the case and remain at large. ""Operation Delego"" was spearheaded by agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. John Morton, the head of ICE, said the day marked a law enforcement ""success"" but was nonetheless a ""sad"" day because of the nature of the crimes involved. ""There are days in this job where it's hard to separate great success from great sorrow and today is such a day. It's a day of great success because we've brought an end to one of the worst instances of Internet child abuse ICE has ever investigated. ... It's a day of great sorrow because this case is ultimately a tale of the perverse and often violent exploitation of children, very, very young children to satisfy the dark pleasures of a group of adult men,"" Morton said. The law enforcement effort has been quietly unfolding in stages during the past few months. Four of the individuals arrested have already pleaded guilty, and all received sentences of more than 20 years in prison. Those sentenced are from Illinois, Alabama, Florida and Kentucky. Those arrested outside the U.S. were picked up by officials in Canada, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Germany, Hungary, Kenya, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Qatar, Serbia, Sweden and Switzerland. Holder said, ""It's hard for me to imagine that there will ever be a penalty that could appropriately deal with this kind of conduct. Twenty to 30 years that the people have gotten in the past is, from my perspective, barely sufficient to handle what they have done in damaging the lives of these young people."" CNN's Senior Producer Jim Barnett contributed to this report.","Fifty-two people have been arrested so far in the U.S., 4 have pleaded guilty, officials say .
10 more men have been charged abroad .

"(CNN) -- Just one in seven engineers are female, only 27% of all computer science jobs are held by women, and ""women have seen no employment growth in STEM jobs since 2000"" reports Forbes. Women who work in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math, and those who campaign for higher numbers of women in these fields, think they have some solutions to this growing problem. 1. ""The toys and games that young girls play with mold their educational and career interests; they create dreams of future careers."" says Andrea Guendelman, co-founder of Developher. ""Extensive research shows that certain toys and games can help young children develop the spatial logic and other analytical skills critical to science, technology, engineering and math. ""A huge part of the reason women are not entering these fields and huge part of the solution starts at the very beginning."" 2. ""Introduce girls early to role models of other women In STEM"" suggests Regina Agyare, founder of Soronko Solutions. ""[These women] will mentor them and introduce them to STEM through games and practical learning experiences."" 3. ""It's important to engage girls in STEM at an early age and keep them interested."" adds Patty L. Fagin, PhD, Head of School at Stuart Country Day School of the Sacred Heart. ""Girls start out as strong in math and science as boys, but lose interest along the way; we call this the ""leaky pipeline."" Grow the pipeline, keep girls engaged, and we'll increase the number of women in STEM. ""Create opportunities for success and safe environments in which to fail. They'll learn to persevere and develop a growth mindset, so critical to success in STEM fields ... instead of ""this is hard, I can't do it,"" they will believe, ""I can try another way."" ""Girls want to make a difference, so give them hands-on, real-world problem-solving activities to show STEM is relevant and fun. ""Expose girls to the different areas of STEM and provide women mentors for girls and young women, so they, in turn, will mentor other girls."" 4. ""There's no magic recipe for getting girls into STEM, but we know early and positive exposure makes an impact."" Karen Horting, CEO and Executive Director at the Society of Women Engineers told CNN. ""Our Invent it. Built it. program Oct. 25 in Los Angeles will expose girls in the sixth to eighth grade to the creative, collaborate nature of a rewarding career in engineering. ""Registration continues through Oct. 11 and additionally provides educators and parents with the tools they need to nurture the future engineers in their lives."" 5. ""Start them young."" is Michelle Sun, Founder and CEO of First Code Academy's advice. ""STEM fields are often thought of as a career path for the boys, globally and no less common in Asia. ""We observe brothers in a family are more likely to be enrolled to our kids coding classes. However, the amazing thing we found, with students from 8 - 11 years old, is that our female students come to our programs with minimal preconception of what programming is about. ""They approached it with much enthusiasm and confidence, just as any other hobbies or subjects. ""By starting them young, we provide them a chance to experience the STEM field first hand."" 6. ""I believe one on one mentoring programs with accomplished female STEM professionals will help bring girls in to the STEM field."" says Adeola Shasanya who recently co-founded Afro-Tech Girls and works at the Lagos State Electricity Board as an Electrical Engineering and Renewables Consultant. ""Fun technical workshops could also help spark a STEM interest for girls. ""I believe work shadowing a female stemist in a typical work environment could enlighten the girls on what work would be like as a STEMist."" 7. Haiyan Zhang, Innovation Director at Lift London, Microsoft Studios believes confidence is key; ""Insatiable curiosity and the self confidence to make change in the world -- two qualities that are key to instil in the female innovators of the future. ""Science, technology, engineering and mathematics become the tools with which to explore curiosity and to create change."" 8. ""Women are the future of technology and today's technology is fun and cool."" says Weili Dai, President and Co-founder of Marvell Technology Group . ""It's not just about developing ""nerdy"" stuff it's about turning technology into fashionable and user-friendly smart solutions. ""A woman's natural talent is design, and the look and feel, and making these things fit into our lifestyles."" ""I believe by embracing STEM and leveraging inherent strength of women -- the sense of responsibility, passion, compassion, and pride we dedicate to family and community -- and applying it to business can make women the X factor in the new era of global growth and prosperity for the ""Smart Life and Smart Lifestyle."""" 9. ""Time and again, I hear from women who chose their STEM career because they were inspired by a successful woman who proved it could be done."" adds Suw Charman-Anderson, Founder of Ada Lovelace Day. ""Role models are incredibly important, both to girls and to women, and we need to show girls just how exciting, fulfilling and enjoyable a career in STEM can be."" ""We must prove that there is a path for them to tread by telling the stories, past and present, of the women who've built, invented, discovered and explained the world around us, but who so often go unmentioned."" 10.""To get more girls in STEM let's go for collective action..."" says Julie Kantor, Chief Partnership Officer at Million Women Mentors.

"(CNN) -- Girls don't do science. If that's the stereotype, then good luck telling that to these women. From space archaeologists, to racing car drivers, and Higgs Boson physicists, here are 12 ladies with some of the world's coolest jobs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). But it wasn't always this way. Growing up, some were told ""You're OK for a girl,"" or ""If you're beautiful, you can't also be smart."" Luckily for us, they didn't take much notice. We take a look at their most inspirational quotes. 1. Karen Nyberg, Astronaut . ""When I was in high school, I was certain that being an astronaut was my goal. It was a very important time -- Sally Ride was making her first flight into space and she had a real impact on me. Those 'firsts' kind of stick in your head and really become inspirations for you."" 2. Zaha Hadid, Architect . ""I used to not like being called a 'woman architect.' I'm an architect, not just a woman architect. The guys used to tap me on the head and say 'you're OK for a girl.' But I see an incredible amount of need from other women for reassurance that it can be done, so I don't mind anymore."" 3. Fabiola Gianotti, Higgs Boson physicist . ""This job is a great scientific adventure. But it's also a great human adventure. ""Mankind has made giant steps forward,"" she said. ""However, what we know is really very, very little compared to what we still have to know."" 4. Milka Duno, Race car driver .

"(CNN) -- On August 15, Floyd Lee Corkins allegedly walked into the Family Research Council in Washington, a conservative think tank, and shot the building manager Leo Johnson in the arm, saying something along the lines of, ""I don't like your politics,"" as he did so. Despite his gunshot wound, police say, Johnson was able to tackle Corkins and wrestle his weapon away before he could harm anyone else. (Corkins pleaded not guilty when he was indicted.) Corkins was volunteering at a Washington community center for lesbian, gay and transgender individuals and his parents said their son had ""strong opinions with respect to those he believes do not treat homosexuals in a fair manner."" The Family Research Council promotes the view that homosexuality is harmful to society. Three years earlier, also in Washington, rabid anti-Semite James von Brunn was charged with shooting and killing Holocaust Museum security officer Stephen Johns. He died while in custody. Opinion: After 9/11, how we honored our son's memory . The shootings at the Holocaust Museum and Family Research Council underlined the fact that acts of political violence against civilians, commonly referred to as terrorism, can be carried out by those espousing many different types of ideology. In fact, since the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people at the World Trade Center and Pentagon 11 years ago, 19 people have died in terrorist attacks in the United States that were motivated by ideologies that have nothing to do with the ideas of Osama bin Laden, but rather were the victims of terrorists motivated by extreme anti-government views or virulent anti-Semitic/neo-Nazi views. Jihadist terrorists, on the other hand, have killed 17 people, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation from thousands of news reports and court documents. (""Jihadist"" terrorists are defined in this database as those associated with or motivated by al Qaeda, or its affiliates or like-minded groups.) There have been 10 deadly attacks in the United States by nonjihadist extremists since 9/11 compared to just four by jihadists. (One of those incidents was at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009 in which 13 were killed.) The New America Foundation study suggests that law enforcement's tendency to regard Muslim-American communities as the most likely source of terrorism risks missing the threat from other extremists. Since 9/11, jihadist and nonjihadist terrorists have killed about the same number of people in the United States, yet 61% of the 337 people indicted for terrorism-related activities since the 9/11 attacks are jihadists, according to the New America Foundation data. Revisiting the mosque at Ground Zero . Since 2009 and 2010 there has been a sharp drop in the number of jihadist defendants, which peaked at 43 and 34 respectively. This year the number of jihadist defendants has dropped to 7, suggesting that the threat from these kinds of terrorists is receding. The spike in jihadist terrorism defendants in 2009 and 2010 was itself largely due to the indictment of a ring of men in Minneapolis conspiring to send themselves and others to Somalia in order to fight on behalf of the al Qaeda linked militant group al-Shabaab. Nine of the 43 jihadists indicted in 2009 were involved in plans to send fighters to Somalia, and 18 of the 34 jihadists indicted in 2010 were also part of this network. U.S. authorities have recently come under fire for purportedly discriminatory counterterrorism tactics, such as the unjustified monitoring of mosques and cafes frequented by Muslims and the inclusion of language in FBI documents and textbooks that stereotypes or presents factually incorrect information about Muslims. Of course, 9/11 rightly brought great law enforcement focus on possible jihadist terrorists. But the New America Foundation's data tends to support the view that law enforcement is more likely to target suspected Muslim militants than other extremists. Although authorities are just as likely to use information provided by a confidential informant in the investigation of both jihadist and nonjihadist terrorist suspects, they are far more likely to place an undercover agent with a suspected jihadist terrorist suspect than a right-wing or left-wing extremist. An overwhelming 78% of the terrorism-related indictments that relied on an undercover agent were jihadist cases. Of the 16 people who have been indicted since 2001 on terrorism-related weapons charges after some sort of sting operation in which the weapons were provided by the U.S. government, 75% were jihadists. Yet the data indicates that nonjihadist terrorists are actually much more likely to have acquired weapons. Since 2001, 64% of the 127 people indicted on terrorism-related weapons charges were nonjihadist terrorists, such as Isaac Aguigui, one of four U.S. Army soldiers indicted in June for allegedly amassing $87,000 worth of guns and bomb parts that they planned to use in terrorist attacks against their home base of Fort Stewart, Georgia, and a park in nearby Savannah, Georgia. Belief: Atheists continue battle against World Trade Center cross at memorial . Just last month, seven people, including two with links to the militant anti-government Sovereign Citizens movement, were indicted in connection with the shooting of four police officers in LaPlace, Louisiana, two of whom were killed. Authorities say Brian Smith allegedly opened fire with an assault rifle on a policeman directing traffic, and then led cops on a high-speed chase that ended at a trailer park, where others were waiting. The two officers were killed in the ensuing gunfight. (Smith has pleaded not guilty.) Additionally, the New America Foundation found that no jihadist terrorists have acquired or even attempted to acquire chemical and biological weapons since 9/11, while 11 anarchist, white supremacist or right-wing extremists have been indicted for possessing such materials, and another four were indicted for attempting to produce them. Some politicians and much of the public continue to believe that the threat from terrorists comes from violent jihadists, when in reality far-right extremists pose as much or possibly even more of a threat, something that we would do well to consider on the 11th anniversary of 9/11. (Thanks to Megan Braun, Fatima Mustafa, Farhad Peikar, and Umar Farooq for their research help.)","In 11 years since September 11, 2001, sources of terror in U.S. have been diverse .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama could be among the Americans traveling to Cuba now that restrictions on passage to the island are being loosened. The White House said Wednesday it wasn't ruling out a presidential visit to Cuba now that diplomatic relations with the United States have been restored. ""I assume, like many Americans, he has seen that Cuba is a place where they have a beautiful climate and a lot of fun things to do,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. ""If there's an opportunity for the President to visit I'm sure that he wouldn't turn it down."" The Obama administration on Wednesday said it was easing restrictions on certain types of travel to Cuba, including visits to family members, trips by journalists and religious activities. But the new rules still do not permit U.S. tourists to visit the island. A visit by the President to Cuba would be historic; even a phone call between Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro on Tuesday marked the first presidential engagement between the two nations since the Cuban Revolution. Obama said Wednesday that high-ranking U.S. officials would visit Cuba soon to begin to establish a presence there.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Thursday said that the recent events surrounding the deaths of two black men at the hands of white police officers underscore that ""too many Americans feel deep unfairness"" with respect to the criminal justice system. ""When it comes, as we've seen unfortunately in recent days, to our criminal justice system, too many Americans feel deep unfairness when it comes to the gap between our professed ideals and how the laws are applied on a day to day basis,"" he said during an address during the White House's College Opportunity Day of Action. The Grand Jury decision not to indict the police officer who killed Eric Garner, an African American father of six, sparked protests throughout New York City and across the nation Wednesday night, just over a week after another acquittal in the death of a black teen at the hands of a white police officer prompted similar unrest across the nation. Obama said he called New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday night to commend him for the way he's handled protests that erupted in the city. The events have inspired a nationwide discussion surrounding race and the criminal justice system, and prompted Obama to host community leaders and elected officials at his office Monday to discuss solutions to the problem. On Thursday, he again pledged to continue working to find a way to tackle the issues with law enforcement in the coming months. But he characterized the challenge ahead as greater than simply reforming the criminal justice system and restoring a sense of justice â€” rather, Obama said, there's a need to restore ""a sense of common purpose"" in America. ""At the heart of the American ideal is this sense that we're in it together, that nobody is guaranteed success but everybody's got access to the possibilities of success, and that we are willing to work not just to make sure our own children have pathways to success, but that everybody does,"" he said.","President Barack Obama spoke at the White House's College Opportunity Day of Action .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Wednesday that he and outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder are ""not going to let up"" in the effort to solve the problem of racial tensions that exists between law enforcement officers and minorities in communities nationwide. Obama's remarks came soon after a grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer in the July chokehold death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man. ""It is incumbent upon all of us as Americans regardless of race, region, faith -- that we recognize this is an American problem and not just a black problem or a brown problem or a native American problem --- this is an American problem when anybody in this country is not being treated equally under the law that's a problem and it's my job as president to help solve it,"" Obama said at the sixth annual White House Tribal Nations Conference. Obama said he had just spoken to Attorney General Eric Holder and ""we are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust and a strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and law enforcement."" The Justice Department is investigating the circumstances surrounding Garner's death and whether civil rights were violated, law enforcement sources tell CNN. The investigation has been quietly proceeding for several months. Holder formally announced the investigation during an event at the Justice Department Wednesday evening. ""This afternoon, I spoke with the widow of Eric Garner to inform her and her family of our decision to investigate potential federal civil rights violations,"" Holder said. ""I've also been in touch with President Obama, as well as Mayor de Blasio regarding our decision. Prosecutors will conduct an independent, thorough, fair and expeditious investigation. In addition to performing our own investigative work, the department will conduct a complete review of the material gathered during the local investigation."" Obama also said law enforcement must improve training and become more accountable in order to strengthen relations within local communities. ""We are going to take specific steps to improve the training and the work with state and local government when it comes to policing in communities of color,"" Obama said. ""We are going to be scrupulous in investigating cases where we are concerned about the partiality and accountability that's taking place."" Rep.

"(CNN) -- Al Goldstein, the foul-mouthed, cigar-chomping publisher of Screw magazine and pornography pioneer who helped move raunch into mainstream American life, died Thursday in New York. He was 77. He is believed to have died of renal failure at a nursing home in Brooklyn, said his lawyer, Charles DeStefano. Throughout his life, Goldstein fought to push the porn trade into mainstream acceptance by challenging the legal barriers against pornography under the First Amendment. In 1968, he published Screw magazine, a smutty, offbeat publication full of political satire, DeStefano said. The magazine caused an national uproar in 1973 when it printed nude photos of former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The issue sold more than 500,000 copies. Goldstein loathed authority and once published a doctored photo of a district attorney who was prosecuting a case against him along with the judge in the case. The pair was depicted in a sexually explicit manner even as the trial was ongoing, DeStefano said. In 1984, Goldstein appeared before a congressional hearing on pornography. The late Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pennsylvania) asked Goldstein whether it was the business of the state to stop pornographic pictures if those images caused the molestation of a child. ""I applaud your concern,"" Goldstein responded. ""But 51,000 people died in car accidents last year. Alcohol contributed to that. Are you going stop the manufacture of automobiles or the cessation of the sale of liquor? What you're going to do is monitor [the sale] of liquor to minors. If somebody misuses something -- whether a knife or a car or pornography -- there are laws on the books to satisfy those concerns... But to deny those of us who handle it as an integrated part of our life is such a contradiction of the First Amendment and what we stand for that it's horrendous and repugnant to me."" For 30 years, Goldstein hosted his nude late-night talk show ""Midnight Blue."" He had been described variously as arrogant, angry, gaudy and irreverent. He flipped the bird every chance he got. In fact, the back yard of his former Florida mansion was once adorned with an 11-foot statue of an extended middle finger. The Brooklyn-born publisher lived life in extremes. He once enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, owned multiple properties and hobnobbed with celebrities, DeStefano said. In his later years, he lost practically everything and ended up homeless in New York. Goldstein was sentenced to 60 days in jail in 2002 for threatening a former employee and leaving obscene messages on her answering machine. In 2003, his business went bankrupt and he was later forced to sell an estate. At one point, Goldstein was working at a greeter at a deli while sleeping in a backroom, said DeStefano, also a longtime friend. The beginning of the end for Goldstein was a hip fracture two years ago, his lawyer said. He was obese and suffered from diabetes and mental health issues, according to DeStefano. ""He should be remembered as a man who had the guts to get in the face of his enemies,"" DeStefano said. ""He was fearless.""

"(CNN) -- In much of the northeastern quadrant of the United States, the past few days have seen the coldest weather in about 20 years. The Midwestern lows have been dangerously, frighteningly low. Near the coast, the weather is slightly less cold, but wilder. At 7 yesterday morning, the temperature outside here in New York City was 53 degrees Fahrenheit. This morning as I write, it's 4 degrees -- that's 49 degrees different. The numbers are indeed extreme. But in a larger sense, the current situation in the atmosphere is the norm -- just more so. Most of the United States lies in the midlatitudes. That means, between the tropics and the pole. We get our weather from both directions. Cold arctic air and hot tropical air can't easily mix together to make lukewarm air, because the earth's rotation deflects them sideways. The result is the jet stream, a very fast air current that blows from west to east at about the altitude (coincidentally) that jet planes fly, along the top of the boundary separating warm from cold. (Sometimes our Northern Hemisphere weather maps show two jet streams, one north of the other. The northern one makes a loop around the pole with the coldest air inside. This cold air mass with the jet around it is what is being called the ""polar vortex"" in recent media stories.) But the cold and warm air can't stay apart forever. The jet undulates, forming giant loops and eddies the size of one or more American states. These are high- and low-pressure systems. They stir the atmosphere around on a giant scale. They can move the air north or south fast enough that it brings some of the climate of the latitude from which it came. Warm moist air coming north ahead of low pressure swirls around cold air plunging south behind it. Where they meet at the ground, temperature contrasts sharpen yet further as cold and warm are squeezed together along fronts. This is the normal state of affairs here in the midlatitudes. Our weather is always a study in contrasts, especially in winter. It's just a more extreme contrast right now -- the jet is more distorted, the cold air plunging down harder against the warm. To be fair, one could say that any severe weather event is just an extreme case of normal weather. In a cosmic sense, Typhoon Haiyan or Superstorm Sandy were also just examples of the atmosphere going about its rounds. It's when the extremes happen to strike people that we have a disaster -- and this cold event, too, is having serious consequences. The difference is that Haiyan and Sandy produced conditions that were extreme by the standards of anywhere on earth. These low temperatures, on the other hand, are normal for the Arctic Circle. What makes this event extreme is not that the cold air exists at all, just that it's roaming a little farther than usual. Why did it happen? With single weather events, as with single stock market fluctuations or single football scores, we can find proximate causes -- things that happened just before that seemed to cause the event. We often can't go beyond that, and not just because our abilities are limited. The atmosphere is inherently chaotic and unpredictable, to the point that larger causes for single events really can't be ascribed meaningfully. And, of course, the weather will change again quickly. But there can be larger causes for gradual changes in the probabilities that certain types of events will occur. Global warming is one such larger cause. Of course, the cold snap which the current jet distortions have brought us doesn't contradict the fact of warming. It's the exception that proves the rule. This is the coldest weather in about 20 years. But it has happened before, and cold weather is happening less often overall. As stated in the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it is ""virtually certain"" that daily minimum temperatures (as well as daily maximum temperatures) over land have increased since 1950. Globally, 2013 saw the warmest November in recorded history, and in recent times high-temperature records have been repeatedly broken much more often than low-temperature records. But low-temperature records will still fall sometimes -- when the jet's wiggles happen to bring cold polar air to somewhere farther south than usual, or bring it faster than usual, before the sun can warm it. Some scientists argue, in fact, that global warming may actually cause this to occur more often. The argument goes like this: A basic feature of global warming is that we expect the poles to warm more than the lower latitudes. Indeed, the North Pole is observed to be warming faster than anywhere else, melting sea ice. (This much is indisputable.) Since our cold snaps are just deliveries of polar air, we might expect them to get less cold. Most of the time they do, hence long-term warming. But because the overall midlatitude temperature contrast has weakened, the jet stream weakens with it. The weakened jet, the argument goes, starts to wobble and meander even more than before. The deliveries of cold air can come faster, or from farther north, than they used to on these bigger meanders. This can overcompensate, at times, for the overall warming. This argument has been strongly questioned by other scientists, including myself. It is certainly counterintuitive, in that it implies that weaker temperature contrasts globally cause stronger temperature contrasts locally. I don't think the research to date justifies such a conclusion. But the research on both sides is all still new and hotly debated. Events like the current one highlight some of what we still don't understand about the relationship of long-term climate changes to short-term extreme weather. We do understand the basics, though. On average, the high temperatures are getting higher, and the lows are getting higher too. Global warming is as real and serious as ever, it's just exceedingly gradual compared with the dramatic temperature swings that are still part of living in midlatitudes in winter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Adam Sobel.","Adam Sobel: We've seen coldest weather in about 20 years in much of the U.S.
He says the fluctuations of normal winter weather patterns are to blame .

"(CNN) -- The excitement over the newest ""Jurassic Park"" movie exploded a few weeks ago with a sneak peek at ""Jurassic World."" This popular dinosaur park-gone-wrong series originated in the 1990s -- 1993 to be exact -- when Hollywood was on a veritable dinosaur movie binge. But let's be honest: How many other '90s dinosaur movies would you want to see a 21st-century version of? Here's some to consider: . 'Adventures in Dinosaur City' (1991) Nearly everyone has that one movie that they watched endlessly as a kid -- only to grow up and realize that the film was actually pretty cheesy. For many millennials, that film was ""Adventures in Dinosaur City,"" a 1991 movie about dinosaur-obsessed kids who fiddle with their scientist-parents' TV experiment and get sucked into their favorite show about dinosaurs and cave men. It's kind of like a cross between ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" and ""Gremlins."" 'Carnosaur' (1993) Released a month before the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie, ""Carnosaur"" couldn't compete with the multimillion-dollar ""Jurassic"" movie franchise that would eclipse it at the box office. Like ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Carnosaur"" had a plot based on a novel about scientifically re-creating dinosaurs. And, like ""Jurassic Park,"" there was also a ""Carnosaur 2"" and ""Carnosaur 3."" But few people remember this trilogy -- so maybe it's time for ""Carnosaur 4."" 'Prehysteria!' (1993) Here's another '90s dinosaur fantasy movie that millennials may have a special fondness for, but it doesn't quite live up to its hype. ""Prehysteria!"" is about some children who get a hold of dinosaur eggs that hatch miniature dinosaurs. And like a lot of bad '90s movies, there were two sequels. 'Tammy and the T-Rex' (1994) This movie -- described by one reviewer as ""horribly hilarious"" -- stars a young Denise Richards as Tammy and Paul Walker as her boyfriend whose brain is implanted in a robotic Tyrannosaurus rex. Yes, you read that right. And it just gets worse from there. Needless to say there's never been another movie plot like ""Tammy and the T-Rex,"" and let's all hope there never is. 'Theodore Rex' (1995) It's hard to believe that Whoopi Goldberg -- nominated for an Academy Award for her unforgettable role in ""The Color Purple"" (1985) and awarded an Oscar for best supporting actress in ""Ghost"" Hollywood was on a veritable dinosaur movie binge(1990) -- agreed to star in ""Theodore Rex,"" a comedy about a cop with a dinosaur for a partner.

"(CNN) -- A social media campaign condemning Islamophobia under the hashtag #illridewithyou has taken off after an armed man who may have links to radical Islam took hostages in Sydney. Anti-Muslim sentiment flared as chilling images from Australian media showed people, believed to be hostages, with their hands pressed against the glass of the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney's central business district. They were holding up a black flag with Arabic writing on it reading, ""There is no God but God and Mohammed is the prophet of God."" The gunman reportedly was demanding an ISIS flag. There were fears that Australian Muslims could become the targets of racially motivated retaliatory attacks. Instead Australian Twitter users offered to accompany Muslims wearing religious clothes on public transport as a gesture of solidarity under the hashtag #illridewithyou. The campaign started with a tweet from @sirtessa, a TV content editor and writer from Sydney whose real name is Tessa Kum. ""If you reg take #373 bus b/w Cogee/Martin Pl, wear religious attire, & don't feel safe alone: I'll ride with you. @ me for schedule,"" she wrote. Kum told BuzzFeed News that ""her heart broke"" after reading a story tweeted by Rachael Jacobs as news of the hostage siege broke. Jacobs had tweeted that ""....and the (presumably) Muslim woman sitting next to me on the train silently removes her hijab ... I ran after her at the train station. I said 'put it back on. I'll walk with u'. She started to cry and hugged me for about a minute - then walked off alone."" Kum added: ""It is hard to feel hope when you feel helpless. #illwalkwithyou is a small act, but might be important for someone one day ... For those of us watching; we live in this world. We aren't bystanders. We aren't helpless."" Kum received such a strong response to her initial tweet that she quickly suggested using the #illridewithyou hashtag, and tweets started coming in from all over Australia and beyond. One Twitter user @Jamus_ wrote: ""Any Muslim person getting the Geelong line (rail line in Melbourne) in the morning, #illridewithyou if you'd like me to. 6:47AM from southern cross."" Another one, Terri, said she would be wearing a scarf around her wrist so that any Muslims who wanted to travel with her would know who she was: ""I'm a semi regular commuter on the #mandurah line. If you see me #illridewithyou. I'll be wearing this scarf."" The hashtag quickly began to trend and turned into a place for people to show their support and speak out against racism and Islamophobia. Nikos de Serf from Melbourne tweeted: ""We are all Australians & we will not turn away from our Muslim brother, sisters, fathers, mothers, loved ones & friend #illridewithyou all."" Phil Burgess, an Australian living in the United Arab Emirates, tweeted: ""We live in Abu Dhabi but I am proud to say that #illridewithyou anytime!"" In a few hours, #illridewithyou has become the top trending hashtag globally and has been mentioned 150,000 times, including retweets, in the past 24 hours, according to social search and analysis site Topsy. Muslims in Australia and across the world have shown their gratitude for the campaign. One user, Angger Prawitasari, wrote: ""Thanks for protecting my sisters #illridewithyou.""

A Creighton spokeswoman said a second female was undergoing surgery and was in critical condition Wednesday afternoon. Three other people were taken to the University of Nebraska Medical Center. One, a 61-year-old man who sustained a chest wound after being shot in the armpit, underwent surgery and remained in critical condition in the intensive care unit Wednesday night, said hospital spokeswoman Maggie O'Brien.

The other two -- a 34-year-old man who was shot in the arm, and a 55-year-old man who fell and struck a clothing rack as he was trying to escape -- were treated and released, she said. Maruca Kovac told CNN that Hawkins left home Wednesday about 11 a.m., and called the house about two hours later, sounding upset. ""He just said he wanted to thank me for everything I'd done for him ... and he was sorry,"" Maruca Kovac said. He told her he had gotten fired from his job, she said.

""It was just so loud, and then it was silence,"" she said. ""I was scared to death he'd be walking around looking for someone else."" She said as she was being escorted out by police, she saw a man lying injured by the escalator where she had been previously. ""All of us were slightly confused because we didn't know what it was,"" said mall employee Charissa Tatoon about the first burst of gunfire. ""Immediately after that, there was a series of maybe 20 to 25 more shots up on the third floor. ""I was in the women's shoe department and there was a gentleman coming down the escalator that was very near the shoe department, and he was heard saying that he was calling 911, and immediately after that, the shooter shot down from the third floor and shot him on the second floor."" Warren, the police chief, said the victims included five females and three males, not including Hawkins. ""We believe there was one shooter, and one shooter only,"" he said. Maruca Kovac said she was unaware Hawkins had any guns, although she said he knew a lot about them, as did his stepfather. ""When he first came to live with us, he was in the fetal position and chewed his fingernails all the time,"" she said. But she said she thought he was improving, as he had gotten a job, a haircut and a girlfriend. However, she said Hawkins and his girlfriend had broken up in the last couple of weeks, and he had taken it hard. She said late Wednesday that authorities were searching her house for evidence.

A spokeswoman said he attended Papillon-La Vista High School until he withdrew in March 2006. Witnesses described chaos and frantic shoppers running away from the Von Maur store, where the shooting began just before 2 p.m. ""You're in such shock, it's hard to think. I was hoping God would spare us,"" said a woman who was clutching a rosary in her trembling hand after the shootings. ""We had to put up our hands and follow the police to the outside.""

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters)  -- Microsoft Corp said Monday it will cut the price of its main Xbox 360 video game console model by about 13 percent in the United States, hoping to boost sales ahead of the crucial holiday season. Microsoft is aiming at expanding the appeal of the Xbox 360 to an audience outside its core fan base. The move reduces the price of the Xbox 360 Premium model by $50, to $350, and follows a move last month by rival Sony Corp to cut the price of its PlayStation 3 machine by 17 percent, to $500. Faced with unexpectedly strong competition from Nintendo Co Ltd's cheaper Wii console, Microsoft is aiming at expanding the appeal of the Xbox 360 to an audience outside its core fan base of young men. ""As we look to the holidays we want to bring in more gamers and lower the price for those customers,"" the Xbox 360's group product manager, Aaron Greenberg, said in an interview. ""We're always trying to bring down cost of the box and ... we always try to pass on the savings to our consumers. We feel like this is the right time to do it."" The price of the Xbox 360 Core, which does not include a hard drive, will fall $20 to $280 while the Elite model, which features a 120-gigabyte drive, six times the size of the Premium's, will fall $30 to $450. The cuts will take effect from August 8, Microsoft said. Launched in November 2005, the Xbox 360 has gone 20 months without a price cut, the longest of any console in history. Sony's PlayStation 2 held its $300 price for 18 months after launching in the United States in 2000. ""It surprised me a little bit because there's not a whole lot of market pressure on them to lower the price,"" said Van Baker, an analyst with market research firm Gartner. ""Is it going to make an enormous difference? No, because when it comes to consoles, it's not the price that sells the console, it's the games that sells the console and from that perspective, Microsoft's in pretty good shape,"" Baker said. The rising sophistication of consoles, which boast graphics performance that rivals personal computers costing several times as much, means manufacturers are more reluctant to drop prices. That's particularly true for Microsoft, which has yet to turn a profit on the Xbox business it launched in 2001 in a bid to challenge Sony's growing dominance in the living room. By the end of June, Microsoft had sold 5.6 million Xbox 360s in the United States, compared with 2.8 million Wiis and 1.4 million PS3s -- the latter two launched a year later. Microsoft forecasts its entertainment and devices division, home to the Xbox, Windows Mobile and Zune digital music player businesses, to turn profitable in its current fiscal year after two years of losses totaling more than $3 billion. The Redmond, Washington-based company has forecast revenue at the division to grow by between 10 percent and 19 percent this year from sales of $6.08 billion in fiscal 2007. Greenberg said Microsoft timed the price cut to coincide with the release of Electronic Arts Inc's ""Madden NFL 08"", the latest installment of the publisher's top-selling football franchise. ""Summer tends to be seasonally slow, but we definitely see a big uptick starting with 'Madden', and accelerating through the end of the year,"" Greenberg said. Microsoft is also banking on the highly anticipated final episode of ""Halo"", its flagship game franchise, to be a major profit driver this year. The game hits stores on September 25.

"Washington (CNN) -- It was just a few words and a joke at that. But Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas broke his seven-year long silence on Monday when he spoke at oral arguments. He made fun of lawyers from Yale, his law school alma mater. Thomas has become known for rarely commenting on cases from the bench, another reflection of the complex and often misunderstood personality of the court's only African-American jurist. On Monday, the justices were hearing an argument about the state of Louisiana's delay in paying for counsel for a death penalty defendant. Should that count against the state for the purposes of the right to a speedy trial? A lawyer for the state was making the case for the inmate's appointed counsel, saying the woman was ""more than qualified"" and ""very impressive."" ""She was graduate of Yale Law School, wasn't she?"" said Justice Antonin Scalia in apparent support, noting another member of the legal team went to Harvard. The next words were hard to hear in the back-and-forth between the justices. But Thomas made a joke about the competence of Yale lawyers when compared to their Harvard colleagues, according to two witnesses. Six members of the current high court attended Harvard Law School. Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor attended Yale. Sotomayor describes life journey in new memoir . The official transcript released by the court does not capture the flavor of the colorful exchange. But the lawyer arguing before the court was apparently not pleased. ""I would refute that, Justice Thomas,"" said Carla Sigler, the assistant district attorney in Lake Charles, Louisiana. The rest of the time, Thomas kept his own counsel as he is known to do. ""One thing I've demonstrated often in 16 years is you can do this job without asking a single question,"" he recalled in a speech five years ago. Written opinions remain the main way the court expresses itself. But the current court is known as a ""hot bench"" for the busy back-and-forth rhetorical scrum during arguments. Eight of the justices compete for time to make their questions and views known. Thomas does occasionally speak from the bench when announcing opinions he has written, but before arguments commence. Off the bench in friendly audiences, he can be gregarious, inquisitive and often self-reflective. He has a booming voice, and his hearty laugh is easily recognizable. Some scholars have said Thomas' aversion to talking has reached epic heights. A study of transcripts by Timothy Johnson of the University of Minnesota found in the past four decades, no justice besides Thomas had failed to speak at least once during an entire 12-month term. The last time he spoke was February 22, 2006, during a capital appeal.","Clarence Thomas known for remaining quiet during oral arguments .

"(Mental Floss) -- Snow and ice may be dominating the weather report, but January is also a great time for another very specific type of precipitation: the Gatorade shower. With the college bowl season winding down and the NFL playoffs heating up this weekend, get ready to see some coaches covered in sports drink. Here are the answers to some burning questions about this fairly new tradition. Who started the tradition? Although the exact origins of the tradition are hotly debated, former New York Giants defensive tackle Jim Burt often gets the credit for the first bath. According to Darren Rovell's interesting book ""First in Thirst: How Gatorade Turned the Science of Sweat into a Cultural Phenomenon,"" Burt had the idea for the prank while the Giants were struggling during the 1985 season. Head coach Bill Parcells had been riding Burt pretty hard before a midseason game against the Washington Redskins, and after the Giants emerged from that game with a 17-3 win, Burt playfully dumped a cooler full of Gatorade on the Big Tuna. Linebacker Harry Carson, a favorite of Parcells, took the baths to the next level. While Burt eventually decided the dousing had lost its originality, Carson kept it up, showering Parcells with Gatorade after each of the Giants' wins en route to their Super Bowl championship during the 1986 season. However, while Burt and Carson popularized the Gatorade shower, they didn't pull off the first dunking. That honor goes to former Chicago Bears lineman Dan Hampton, who collaborated with teammates Steve McMichael and Mike Singletary to get coach Mike Ditka wet after a regular-season win over the Vikings in 1984. Who was Carson's most famous victim? When the Giants made their trip to the White House in early 1987 to celebrate their Super Bowl victory, Carson brought the tradition with him. His target: none other than Ronald Reagan. Of course, it would have been a crime to mar Reagan's fastidiously styled hair with sports drink, so Carson showered the president with a Gatorade cooler full of popcorn. Carson later wrote on his Web site, ""How many people can say they did that to the President with Secret Service agents standing near with guns under their jackets?"" Mental Floss: See Reagan getting the Gatorade treatment . What did Gatorade think of the whole idea? How could any company be irked by such great free advertising? When Gatorade's head of sports marketing, Bill Schmidt, heard John Madden describing the Gatorade shower to millions of viewers during a Giants-49ers playoff game, he said, ""I think I've died and gone to heaven."" Did Parcells and Carson get anything for their trouble? According to Rovell, since Gatorade didn't actually invent the ritual, they weren't quite sure how to handle the situation. To show the brand's gratitude to the coach and his linebacker, Gatorade sent both men $1,000 Brooks Brothers gift certificates, along with a note from Schmidt. (""We do feel somewhat responsible for your cleaning bill,"" he wrote.) After the G-Men won the Super Bowl, though, a more formal endorsement seemed like a good idea. Parcells got a $120,000 deal for a three-year deal, and Carson picked up $20,000 of his own. Did any coaches truly loathe the Gatorade bath? Of course. Legendary Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula wanted no part of a Gatorade shower and ordered his players not to douse him. Mental Floss: Coaches do the darndest things (like stage their own death) Has a victory bath ever turned deadly? Possibly. In November 1990, 72-year-old former Redskins and Rams coach George Allen led Long Beach State to a season-ending victory over UNLV, and his players rewarded him with a dunk from the cooler. Dousing a septuagenarian with cold liquid is a questionable move even in a temperate climate, and the drenching did quite a number on Allen's body. He died of ventricular fibrillation on December 31, 1990; just one week earlier, he had commented in an interview that his health had never really returned following the bath. Don't blame Allen's death on Gatorade, though. According to Allen, the team ""couldn't afford Gatorade,"" so the possibly deadly liquid barrage was regular old ice water. What other Gatorade baths have gone wrong? It wasn't deadly, but the Gatorade shower Kentucky coach Guy Morriss received in the waning moments of the Wildcats' 2002 game against LSU was pretty embarrassing. With just seconds left to play in the game, Kentucky looked like a lock to pull off a major upset over the Tigers, so Morriss' players doused the coach with Gatorade. Unfortunately for Morriss and Big Blue Nation, there's a difference between looking like a lock to win and actually winning. LSU wideout Devery Henderson quickly scored a miracle touchdown on a tipped Hail Mary play, and Morriss was left standing on the sidelines, drenched and disappointed. Mental Floss: What's a Crimson Tide, anyway? Has the Gatorade bath made the leap to other sports? Sure it has. When the Boston Celtics captured the 2008 NBA title to end a 22-year drought, Finals MVP Paul Pierce doused coach Doc Rivers with a cooler full of red Gatorade. Reporters speculated that this might have been the first time the Gatorade shower had crossed over to the NBA. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"Sydney (CNN) -- Impossible to explain, harder to believe. This week a young man in the prime of his life went to work. He was the envy of many because he loved what he did, and was living a dream he'd held onto since he was a boy growing up on a farm. He did not come home. A wall did not fall on him, a tractor did not overturn. Enough headlines have already told us that Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes died as a result of a freakish accident. Hit on the head by a ball delivered at about 140 kilometers an hour. In this age of the relentless news cycle, story angles have been sharpened and pointed. Questions need to be asked. One in particular: Could the accident have been avoided? The simple answer is ""Yes,"" but then comes the ""If only."" Not just one, but a crowd of them. If only Phillip's head had been at a different angle. If only his helmet had provided greater protection. If only bouncers were banned. If only... the words are never more tormenting than at times of tragedy . Somewhere, hiding behind the obvious is a deeper, much more provocative contemplation: If only we -- fans, administrators, the media and players -- didn't encourage danger in sport. But we do. A fast bowler firing throat balls at a squirming batsman. A quarterback blindsided into the turf. Race cars bumper-to-bumper at 150 miles an hour. Unscripted theater . Why do we want to watch? Because such moments are exhilarating. For the fans it is the most captivating unscripted theater. For the administrators it is dollars through the turnstiles, for the media it is back-slaps when the ratings come out, and for the elite athlete? Well, he or she may not always enjoy every moment of it, but the opportunity to negotiate the fragile line between invincibility and fallibility is one of the most enticing challenges of any risk-associated sport. Phillip Hughes knew that. He felt it too. To see him kick up his heels and punch the air when celebrating a century was not the sign of a champion who'd had an easy fight. When cricket administrators sit down and analyze frame by excruciating frame of Phillip's last stand, they will see a picture that is much more complex than a split second of disaster. Nowhere has this become more apparent than in the United States where the NFL has discovered that playing fields stretch well beyond the turf to the courtroom. Legal action by former players over concussion-related brain problems is costing the League hundreds of millions of dollars. At the core of the issue are accusations that officials concealed the danger of concussions while encouraging players to get back on their feet and charge into the fray again. It's what the fans wanted. It also made for good promo reels. And that of course helped the bucks roll in. Other high impact football codes across the world are taking notice. The days of smelling salts are over. Athletes are commodities . All elite sports have their own problems. Needles, Lance Armstrong, and the Tour de France immediately come to mind. And so does English soccer where justice is being sought for Jeff Astle. Twelve years ago an inquest ruled that he had died from brain trauma caused by heading heavy leather balls in the 1950s through to the 70s. Across many sports, there remain many lessons to learn. Sport is always evolving. These days, it is a multi-billion dollar industry. Athletes are commodities, mobile billboards with marketing clauses built into their contracts. They must do what their bosses tell them. Otherwise, it's ""thanks for your efforts, good luck in the future."" The pressure they face is immense. Again, Phillip Hughes knew that. He was on the brink of a recall to the Australian test team, the highest honor of his sport, his job. Now, he will never get that chance. It's up to all of us to decide what that really means.","Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes died as a result of a freakish accident .

"HOUSTON, Texas (CNN) -- A comic-book character popular in Mexico for generations has run into a cultural barrier at the border, where Americans see him as a racist caricature. Comic book character Memin Pinguin is ""a disgrace,"" an African-American activist says. For more than 60 years Mexicans have followed the adventures of ""Memin Pinguin."" But the dark-skinned Memin's exaggerated features in ""Memin for President"" came as a shock to Houston, Texas, Wal-Mart shopper Shawnedria McGinty. ""I was like, OK, is that a monkey or a boy?"" McGinty said. ""To me it was an insult."" She'd never heard of ""Memin Pinguin."" She bought a Spanish-English dictionary and tried translating but still didn't like what she saw.  Watch what upset McGinty » . ""So I asked my boyfriend, does that look like a monkey to you?"" she said. ""And we went back and forth and he was like, no, that's a black woman,"" referring to the character's Aunt Jemima-like mother. McGinty and Houston community activist Quannel X want the comic books removed from the stores. ""This is absolutely insensitive toward race, in particular the African-American culture, and also people of color,"" Quannel X said. ""This is poking fun at the physical features of an entire people."" But Mexican readers who grew up following the shenanigans of Memin say critics need to look beyond the cover and understand the stories. ""They will bring a smile to their face because we're so fond of that character,"" said Javier Salas, a Spanish-language talk show host on Chicago radio station WRTO. ""We respect him, we love him. And that's why it's so absurd for us to hear complaints from people who don't know, don't understand Memin."" Memin is a poor Cuban-Mexican kid with bug eyes, thick lips and protruding ears. The mischievous and caring boy helps his mother by selling newspapers and shining shoes. ""We grew up reading, learning and educating ourselves with a lot of the topics they always touched on, which was honesty, justice, tolerance. He was a very unique character,"" Salas said. Wal-Mart spokesman Lorenzo Lopez said the retailer has instructed stores to remove the books from shelves and discontinue sales. ""We received the customer complaint regarding the book, which we knew was based on a popular cartoon character in Mexico. We looked into it further, and we decided to no longer distribute the book and are in the process of removing the books from the stores."" The store has received no other complaints about Memin, Lopez said. ""We have a wide array of products that we provide to Hispanic customers, but when we looked at this more carefully and given the sensitivity of the topic, we thought it was best to no longer carry the book in our stores,"" he said. He did not know how many copies of Memin books the chain had or how long it would take to remove them from displays. Memin is no stranger to controversy. Three years ago, a series of Mexican stamps honoring Memin ignited an international uproar. The stamps were discontinued because of protests from African-American leaders. ""This is saying we respect and regard the African-American community by making them look like Sambos on a stamp?"" the Rev. Al Sharpton said at the time. ""This goes over the line."" Quannel X called the comic book ""a disgrace."" ""Look how they portray his mother, with huge ethnic lips, dark skin, making her look like the big gorilla and him like the little monkey."" But fans of Memin say the valuable lessons of a beloved comic book character tackling real-life problems have been lost in translation.","Wal-Mart pulls popular Mexican books after shopper complains .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A Navy team including some 200 industry experts and scientists has been working furiously since January to modify the Aegis air-defense missile system so it can shoot down a failed satellite officials say could fall to Earth, a Pentagon official told CNN. A Delta II rocket lifts off in December, carrying a  reconnaissance satellite that failed hours later. The Pentagon said the U.S. Navy plans to try to shoot down a faulty spy satellite with a modified anti-missile missile on Wednesday. It would be the first such maneuver in more than two decades -- and the first ever using sea-based missiles. Without any intervention, officials believe the 5,000-pound secret spy satellite would fall to Earth on its own in early March. Because it malfunctioned immediately after it was launched in December 2006, it has a full tank -- about 1,000 pounds -- of frozen, toxic hydrazine propellant on board. Authorities said the fuel tank probably would survive re-entry and could disperse harmful or even potentially deadly fumes over an area the size of two football fields. Hydrazine is similar to chlorine or ammonia in that it affects the lungs and breathing tissue. Pentagon sources said the Navy is attempting to take its first shot about 10:30 p.m. ET, or 5:30 p.m. Hawaii time. A formal notice was issued earlier this week, warning ships and planes to stay clear of a large area of the Pacific Ocean west of Hawaii. The window covered by the ""Notice to Airmen"" begins about 9:30 p.m. ET Wednesday (4:30 p.m. Hawaii time) and lasts for 2½ hours. Among the team's challenges was modifying the sensors designed to detect the heat from an incoming warhead because the satellite will be much cooler. Selected for the mission is the Aegis-equipped cruiser USS Lake Erie, which is fully equipped with sea-based missile defense systems, and has long been the Navy's primary ship for the sea-based missile defense program, officials said. The Lake Erie will be joined in the Pacific by two destroyers, the USS Decatur and the USS Russell. The Lake Erie will fire the missile, the Decatur will feed trajectory information to the Erie, and the Russell will be the Decatur's backup, authorities have said. The satellite and the missile will be heading toward each other at about 22,000 mph. The satellite is about the size of a school bus, authorities have said, and the missile will be aimed at its fuel tank, which is about 3 or 4 feet long. The missile would release a ""kinetic kill vehicle,"" enabling it to ""see"" the satellite and adjust its course toward it, officials have said. After the first of the three missiles is shot, officials will determine if the satellite was hit. If it wasn't, they may take another shot, depending on whether they have enough time. The window of time for the operation begins hours after the scheduled landing of the space shuttle Atlantis at 9:07 a.m. ET. Officials earlier had said a shootdown of the satellite would not be attempted until after the shuttle had landed. Pentagon officials have cautioned that the advisory reflects only the first opportunity to take a shot at the satellite, although the attempt could be delayed until later. ""It's possible the conditions won't be ideal, or that everything won't be ready,"" a Pentagon official, who asked not to be identified, told CNN. It's unclear whether the event will be visible to the naked eye, as it will occur in daylight. The satellite will be visible with infrared imaging gear. Those looking into the western sky -- in the right spot -- from Hawaii may be able to see the satellite's demise, but it's unlikely that viewers will be treated to the spectacular light show witnessed by those on the Pacific island of Fiji when the Russian space station Mir streaked across the sky during its fiery re-entry in 2001. Officials have told CNN the shootdown carries a $40 million to $60 million price tag. The missile alone costs $10 million, Lt. Gen. Carter Ham told reporters. The goal is to strike the satellite in low orbit, just before it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, at an altitude of about 150 miles. The missile will carry no warhead, as the idea is to blast the satellite apart on impact so that the hydrazine tank explodes.  Watch Pentagon spokesman Jeff Morrell describe the launch window » . The smaller debris would be more likely to burn up in the atmosphere. Most of the debris would re-enter the atmosphere within hours of impact, NASA Administrator Michael Griffin has said. Deputy National Security Adviser James Jeffrey said earlier this month that President Bush made the decision to shoot the satellite down after consulting with several government and military officials and aerospace experts. The United States last shot down a satellite in 1985, using a missile fired from an F-15 fighter jet at an altitude of about 80,000 feet. In January 2007, China used a land-based missile to destroy a 1-metric ton (2,200-pound) satellite that was orbiting 528 miles above the Earth. The impact left more than 100,000 pieces of debris orbiting the planet, NASA estimated -- 2,600 of them ""large,"" or more than 4 inches across. The U.S. agency called the breakup of the Fengyun-C satellite the worst in history. China, however, is among a host of countries monitoring the satellite shootdown. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- A 14-year-old California boy told police he drowned his 4-year-old neighbor on Friday because the child had threatened to tell his mother the older boy had molested him, according to an affidavit made public Wednesday. Raul Renato Castro has been charged in Fresno County as an adult, with special circumstances including murder during a child molestation, sodomy, kidnapping and murder of a witness to prevent testimony, according to the district attorney's office. He faces separate felony charges of kidnapping, sodomy and child molestation. The affidavit, filed by the Fresno County Sheriff's Department, says Castro told investigators he lured the victim, Alex Christopher Mercato, into his apartment ""by telling the victim he had something to show him."" Police have said no one else was in the Mendota, California, house at the time. Castro then talked the boy into entering the bathroom, according to the document. Castro said he then sodomized the child, after which ""the victim tripped over the carpet, fell, and hit the back of his head on the bathtub,"" the affidavit says.

"(CNN) -- The deaths of several people Monday during a raid by Israeli soldiers on a flotilla bringing aid to Palestinians in Gaza has once again brought worldwide attention on Israel's blockade of the area. Who organized the flotilla? The Free Gaza Movement, a Cyprus-based human rights group, brought together a number of organizations to form the Freedom Flotilla. The coalition includes the European Campaign to End the Siege on Gaza. Another pro-Palestinian group, Insani Yardim Vakfi (IHH), a Turkish organization, also sent a ship. The flotilla left Cyprus on Sunday and had been due to arrive in Gaza on Monday. Why a flotilla? The Free Gaza Movement says it wants to raise awareness of what it describes as the ""illegal siege on Gaza"" by Israel. It says the blockade of Gaza by Israel is unjustified and that it denies Palestinians vital goods and services. ""We want to raise international awareness about the prison-like closure of Gaza and pressure the international community to review its sanctions policy and end its support for continued Israeli occupation,"" the group says on its website. What did the convoy consist of? Six ships -- three passenger and three cargo vessels -- were carrying over 10,000 tons of aid and 600 passengers from more than 20 countries, says the Free Gaza Movement. Most of the passengers were Turkish. The cargo consisted of food, medical aid and other supplies including cement, prefabricated housing and educational equipment, the group said. The Turkish prime minister said Monday that the vessels were inspected before they left port in Turkey to make sure the cargo did not include weapons. What does Israel say about the blockade? The blockade was imposed by Israel in 2007 after the militant group Hamas seized control of Gaza. It is designed to stop the smuggling of arms into the territory, the Israeli government says. Israel says the Gaza shoreline is closed to maritime traffic. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said Israeli civilians were plagued a year ago by rockets and missiles fired from Gaza that originated in places like Iran and Syria. What happens next? The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday called for a ""prompt, impartial, credible and transparent"" investigation into the raid. Across the world, protest rallies against the raid are being staged and criticism of the action continues to pour in. In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has a pre-scheduled meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu on Tuesday. Where are the activists? Israel said that 600 flotilla activists were transported to Beer Sheva prison in southern Israel. Forty-five of them have been released and were either deported or taken to Ben Gurion International Airport. Those who remain detained are ones who have refused to identify themselves to Israeli immigration authorities, an Israeli Prison Authority spokesman told CNN. None have been placed under arrest, he said. Among the ones who have refused to give their names are many foreigners, a police spokesman said. The process involved in deporting these latter protesters is more complicated, as it requires the involvement of foreign diplomats, police said. Have ships been sent to Gaza during the blockade before? Yes, the Free Gaza Movement says on its website it has organized eight voyages to Gaza, ""successfully arriving in Gaza five times."" The group said its ""boats are the first international ships to sail to the Gaza Strip since 1967."" What does the U.N. say about the blockade? The United Nations has described the blockade of Gaza by Israel as the ""collective punishment"" of the Palestinian people living there. The U.N. has repeatedly criticized the blockade and what it says is an insufficient flow of materials into the area for basic needs and reconstruction. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has warned the closure ""creates unacceptable suffering, hurts forces of moderation and empowers extremists."" What goods does Israel allow into Gaza? About 15,000 tons of humanitarian aid flows into Gaza each week, Regev has said. Israel says it allows enough humanitarian aid -- including food and medicines -- into Gaza for the people who live there and that the blockade is designed to stop Hamas from building or acquiring arms. Israel has never published a list of banned items, but it has refused to allow into Gaza books, paper, blankets and reconstruction materials. The U.N. says 80 percent of Gazans rely on some form of humanitarian aid. Why did Israel object to the flotilla? The Israeli government described the flotilla as a ""provocation"" and said it was a political stunt. Danny Ayalon, the Israeli deputy foreign minister, said: ""The organizers' intent was violent, their method was violent and the results were unfortunately violent."" The Free Gaza Movement said the flotilla's aim was to ""challenge Israel's blockade of 1.5 million Palestinians trapped in an open-air prison."" Was there another route for this aid? The Israeli government said it would allow humanitarian aid on the flotilla into Gaza through its normal channels. An IDF spokesman said the vessels ""refused to comply with an invitation to come to Ashdod port where they could transfer aid into the Gaza strip."" Audrey Bomse, legal adviser to the Free Gaza Movement, told CNN the group did not believe the Israelis would let the cargo into Gaza, and that the cargo also included reconstruction aid which Israel does not allow into Gaza. How did things turn violent? The Israel government says its soldiers faced violent resistance as they boarded the largest ship, the Marmara. The Free Gaza Movement denies there was violent resistance to Israeli soldiers, saying the soldiers immediately opened fire on unarmed civilians. Video released by the Israeli Defense Forces showed intense fighting on the decks of the ship. How many people were killed? The number remains in dispute. Israel says nine flotilla participants were killed. The Free Gaza movement said the death toll was higher, but did not offer an exact number.","Flotilla left Cyprus Sunday, was due to arrive in Gaza on Monday .

"Paris (CNN) -- A librarian in northern France made what may be the discovery of his lifetime when he uncovered a rare Shakespeare's First Folio in his library's collection. There are fewer than 240 known copies of the First Folio -- the first printed collection of 36 of William Shakespeare's plays, produced in 1623, seven years after his death -- so turning up a new one is an unlikely event. For Remy Cordonnier, director of the medieval and early modern collection at the library in Saint-Omer, the moment he realized what he held in his hands was one of excitement -- and disbelief. He was preparing an exhibition on Anglo-Saxon authors in September when he came across the First Folio. It was missing some pages, which is why it had been misfiled many decades ago. ""We looked deeper and we realized quickly that it was not a common edition,"" Cordonnier told CNN. At first, the director could not believe what he had found. ""I think I have 2.5 million pounds in my hands,"" he told his boss. He then sought advice from Eric Rasmussen, a Shakespeare expert at the University of Nevada in Reno. ""I am not an expert myself on Shakespeare's pieces, so I wanted to have the opinion of an expert,"" said Cordonnier. ""This is why I contacted Eric Rasmussen to make sure they did not already know about the First Folio. He was actually in London working on the Shakespeare year at the British Library and agreed to come to authenticate the document."" Rasmussen's authentication, just this past weekend, confirmed what Cordonnier had suspected. The Saint-Omer library was home to a Shakespeare's First Folio. This discovery ""will add prestige to the region and help reconnect with our illustrious history, unfortunately forgotten for a century and a half,"" Cordonnier said. The library still plans to make the First Folio part of the Anglo-Saxon exhibition, but it will not be put on display. ""It is going to be digitized to be accessible to the public, at least virtually,"" Cordonnier said. The precious book, meanwhile, will be stored in a safe to protect it from any damage. According to the British Library, which holds four copies, the First Folio was produced by two of Shakespeare's fellow actors and closest friends, John Heminge and Henry Condell. Although some of the playwright's works had been published before in a smaller, poorly edited format, the roughly 900-page book was the first to unite almost all of them, categorized as ""Comedies, Histories and Tragedies."" Without the First Folio, much of Shakespeare's work would have been lost to subsequent generations. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, with 82 First Folios, has the single largest collection of the books, representing one-third of the world's existing copies. Shakespeare turns 450 this year . CNN's Marion Lory reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London.","A librarian stumbles across a previously unknown Shakespeare's First Folio .

"(CNN) -- I once stayed at a youth hostel in Copenhagen called Sleep in Heaven. Which sounds quite pleasant until you realize that, apparently, heaven is cold and damp and completely infested with bedbugs. I guess that's the part they don't tell you in Sunday school. ""No, no. It's great. Nothing to worry about. Beautiful white robes. Big puffy clouds. Probably a salad bar."" But there were none of those. Just bed bugs. Something was rotten in the state of Denmark. The next day, bitten and disgusted, I literally ran to catch a train to Berlin and haven't had pleasant thoughts about that country since. This was back in 2003. The tortured memories persist and still haunt my dreams. Which is why, the other day, almost eleven years later, I was delighted to learn that the United States finally invaded Denmark, set it on fire, and raised the American flag. Sort of. Here's what happened. There's a wildly popular computer game called ""Minecraft"" where, as best I understand it, players build highly imaginative environments and constructions using 3D cubes. It's sort of like a modern, digital-version of Lego, but without the risk of waking up the neighbors when you step barefoot on a wayward block. ""Harold, I think Paul next door is constipated again."" ""Mark it on the chart, Diane."" Now, I've never actually played this game because I'm a grown man with far more important things to do like tweeting and running my pretend fantasy football sports dynasty. So, to the millions of fine people who play ""Minecraft,"" I sincerely apologize for oversimplifying your beloved game. It's all just too complicated, for I have six functioning brain cells, and five of them are dedicated to breathing and blinking. But, from what I can tell, part of the fun in ""Minecraft"" is creating these new virtual worlds and exploring those of others. And it's also a way to re-imagine worlds that already exist. So, the Danish government sanctioned the creation of a replica version of their country within ""Minecraft"" to use as a progressive teaching tool for schoolchildren, educating them about Denmark's geography. Really, it was a wonderfully creative and virtuous idea. Thus, cyber vandals promptly decided to blow it up. Somehow, these vandals were able to infiltrate virtual Denmark while sneaking in virtual dynamite, at which point they virtually demolished parts of virtual Copenhagen. What's interesting is that the use of this virtual dynamite was actually banned on the Danish server. But the ever-cunning vandals discovered they could sneak it in inside a virtual mining cart. Which is both amazing and ridiculous .. that it should come to this. But through their virtual sneak attack invasion, the vandals proudly constructed virtual American flags all over town, and built virtual signs reading: AMERICA. (Forgive me for a moment as I cue some Lee Greenwood and dab these red, white, and blue tears of pride rolling down my cheeks.) Initially, it was believed that the virtual damage was virtually catostraphic and virtually widespread. However, Chris Hammeken, an actual spokesperson from the Danish Geodata Agency, explained to the BBC, ""Only a minor area was destroyed."" There was no official word on whether or not a virtual Sleep In Heaven youth hostel was annihilated in the process. I guess a man can dream. Though the Danish Geodata Agency was quickly able to fully ""repair"" the ""destruction,"" there was no fixing the psychological damage. Soon after the attack, images appeared on a ""Minecraft"" forum, and Denmark's defeat had officially gone public. And viral. Now, understand that I'm not an outwardly patriotic individual. But, despite the fact that -- all kidding aside -- Denmark really is a beautiful country with incredibly happy, intelligent, and peaceful citizens, I have to admit that, upon reading about this I felt a rather large twinge of U.S.A. pride. The whole thing was just so absurd and wonderfully American. Oh, that it should come to this. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.","A virtual version of Denmark was created in the ""Minecraft"" game .

"(CNN) -- Zambian opposition leader Michael Sata took office after the incumbent president tearfully conceded in a televised speech, a rare moment in African politics following a recent string of troubled elections. Rupiah Banda acknowledged he had lost the election and urged his supporters to maintain peace. ""Now is not the time for violence and retribution,"" Banda said. ""Now is the time to unite and build tomorrow's Zambia together."" He called on citizens to recognize Sata as the new president. ""I have no ill feeling in my heart, there is no malice in my words. I wish him well in his years as president,"" Banda said Friday, according to a statement on his party's website. Zambians applauded the concession, relieved that it will ease transition following minor clashes this week as citizens demanded faster vote counting to curtail rigging. ""There is an atmosphere of peace now that the election is over,"" said Nanty Nkwachi, a resident of the second-largest city of Kitwe. ""I'm OK with the outcome. Of course I'm disappointed that my candidate lost, but I'm happy that democracy won."" Zambia has remained relatively peaceful amid violence in nearby nations. Minor clashes flared up in major cities this week as residents demanded the release of the election results, but officials appealed for calm. Recent elections in Africa, including in Nigeria and Ivory Coast, have descended into chaos. Ivory Coast required international mediators when the incumbent president defied calls to cede power after he lost the election. ""I hope other African nations can learn from Banda,"" said Mutheliso Phiri, 36 . ""We are a young but mature democracy. My friends from Uganda and other places are sending me messages saying that we set a good example."" The new president, a veteran politician who narrowly lost to Banda in 2008, is nicknamed ""King Cobra"" for his fiery tongue. The major critic of Chinese investment in the nation's copper industry has especially targeted foreign companies that mistreat Zambian workers. Last year, Chinese managers at a mine in the nation used shotguns to fire at unarmed workers protesting poor labor conditions. At least 11 miners were wounded, reviving an outcry against foreign employers. Analysts said despite Sata's stance, the new leader will not jeopardize ties with his nation's major investor. ""A lot of the threats have been lip service to appease voters and show that he is tough,"" said Ayo Johnson, director of London-based Viewpoint Africa. ""Zambia needs the foreign exchange and the investments. It has a lot of young, poor but very educated youth with university degrees who feel disenfranchised and need the jobs the Chinese are providing."" Michelle Mulenga is one such youth. The 29-year-old Kitwe resident hopes the new president will keep his pledge to provide more jobs. ""We'll just have to wait and see,"" she said. ""He's a hardworking man and has done a good job in his past positions."" Johnson said Chinese companies are ""shrewd and diplomatic investors"" and will ensure they accommodate the new government to tap into its resources and expand investments. Banda became president three years ago after his predecessor died. He has enjoyed popularity in the nation, but most young voters wanted him out to validate the fact that Zambia is a democracy, according to Phiri. ""His party (Movement for Multiparty Democracy) has been in power since 1991,"" he said. ""A lot of people who voted were young ... they wanted change because they have not seen any other leadership."" Phiri said most youth today are becoming resentful of long-term rulers. ""He was almost like their Gadhafi -- this was their way of revolting against a party they felt has been in power for too long,"" Phiri said, referring to the ousted Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi. U.S. President Barack Obama applauded the outgoing leader for promoting democracy and a peaceful transition. The United States looks forward to working with the new president and building on the partnership between the two nations, Obama said in a statement.","The new president is nicknamed ""King Cobra"" for his fiery tongue .

"(CNN) -- Ashes found in the stove of a Romanian home have become the focus of investigations into the theft of seven valuable paintings by artists including Picasso, Matisse and Monet -- amid fears they may have gone up in smoke. Experts from Romania's National History Museum have been analyzing the ashes for traces of paint and other chemicals that would confirm whether the works stolen last year from a Dutch museum have been destroyed. The ashes come from the stove of one of the people indicted in the case, Ernest Oberlander-Tarnoveanu, general director of Romania's National History Museum said Thursday. ""Works of art and paintings have been burned and there are traces of typical red, yellow and green pigments,"" he told CNN affiliate ProTV. But it's not yet confirmed whether these traces are all that remains of the stolen artwork. Six people have been charged by the Romanian public prosecutor's office in connection with the theft from the Kunsthal museum in the Dutch city of Rotterdam on the night of October 15 last year. Three men, Radu Dogaru, Darie Eugen and Adrian Procop, are charged with robbery counts. A woman, Olga Dogaru, is accused of complicity in the crime by transporting and hiding the stolen artwork, the prosecutor's office said. Two other defendants are accused of helping the alleged thieves by trying to value or sell the paintings. The paintings, in oil and watercolor, include Pablo Picasso's ""Harlequin Head,"" Henri Matisse's ""Reading Girl in White and Yellow,"" Claude Monet's Waterloo Bridge"" and ""Charing Cross Bridge,"" and ""Woman with Eyes Closed"" by Lucian Freud. Works by Gauguin and Meyer de Haan were also taken. The loss resulting from the theft is estimated at â‚¬18 million, the prosecutor's office said.","Experts analyze ashes found in a stove to see if they are the remains of stolen artwork .

"(CNN) -- The American Psychological Association is calling on  state and federal officials to stop anti-gay legal measures and to legalize  same-sex marriage. The scientific and professional organization's guiding  body voted unanimously at its annual meeting this week in Washington  to declare its support  for ""full marriage equality for same-sex couples."" The resolution ""clarifies the Association's support for  same-sex marriage"" in light of new research, the group said. A similar resolution in 2004  opposed discrimination against same-sex relationships, but refrained from a more  formal policy recommendation. Dr. Clinton Anderson, APA associate executive director,  said that the timing of the  resolution is an indirect result of several states' legalization of  marriage. ""We knew that marriage benefits heterosexual people in  very significant ways, but we didn't know if that would be true for same-sex  couples,"" said Anderson, who is also director of the APA's Office on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Concerns. Now that six U.S.  states permit same-sex marriage, researchers have been able to conduct studies  with those couples. The research, Anderson said, indicates that marriage ""does  confer the same sense of security, support, and validation"" to same-sex couples  as to heterosexual ones. The resolution also points to evidence that ongoing  political debate about marriage creates stress for gay men and lesbians and  perpetuates stigmas and prejudice about their communities. This stress can make  people physically and psychologically sick, the APA says, calling the link  between stress and illness ""well established."" Maggie Gallagher, chairman of the board of the National  Organization for Marriage, takes issue with the assertion that legalizing  same-sex marriage would improve community acceptance of homosexuality. ""There  is no evidence that gay teens are better off in Massachusetts, a state that has gay marriage, than they  are in Wisconsin, a state which has passed a marriage  amendment defining marriage as one man and one woman,"" she  said in an e-mail response to CNN. Gallagher continued, ""The release of this statement is  unfortunately going to undermine confidence in APA statements generally, I would  predict."" Both the National Organization for Marriage and the APA  are skeptical of one solution to the gay-marriage debate: civil unions. Rhode  Island NOM executive director Chris Plante is quoted in a press release on the  NOM website calling the move ""nothing more than a Trojan Horse that will usher in  same-sex marriage sooner rather than later.""  Elsewhere on its website, NOM  calls for dealing with legal and economic benefits separately from any  discussion of marriage or unions. The APA also feels that civil unions miss the mark. ""Anything other than marriage is, in essence, a stigmatization of same-sex  couples. Stigma does have negative impacts on people,"" Anderson said. ""That's the  analysis that we've come to and why we've decided to support full marriage  equality -- because domestic partnership or civil union will still convey the  message that same-sex couples are not as good.""","American Psychological Association declares support for ""full marriage equality""

"(CNN) -- Has the world of football bitten back? One of the game's most controversial characters, Luis Suarez, has been left off the 23-man longlist for the prestigious Ballon d'Or for ""disgracing himself on the pitch."" The award, which is voted for by coaches and captains of national teams and journalists across the world selected by France Football Magazine, will be awarded in Zurich, Switzerland, on January 12. While the likes of holder Cristiano Ronaldo and four-time winner Lionel Messi are up for the gong, Suarez's name is nowhere to be seen, despite the former Liverpool striker jointly winning the Golden Boot with the Real Madrid forward. Barcelona's Suarez returned to action in last weekend's El Clasico against Real Madrid after completing his four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's World Cup clash with Italy. Football's bad boy has paid the price for his behavior according to Philippe Auclair, the London-based correspondent for France Football Magazine. ""The criteria used for the selection of the longlist of Ballon d'Or contenders by France Football and FIFA are very clear,"" Auclair told CNN. ""A player who has disgraced himself on the pitch as Suarez has, cannot and will not be included, regardless of his achievements throughout the calendar year. ""In short, under no circumstances could the Uruguayan be considered for the award. I think that this is clear enough."" Suarez joined the Catalan club for a transfer fee reported to be in the region of Â£75 million ($128.5 million) following a sensational season with Liverpool. The 27-year-old scored 31 goals for Liverpool with the team just missing out on the English Premier League title, although it did qualify for the Champions League for the first time in four seasons. Suarez's snub looks to have come following his bite on Chiellini -- the third time he has committed such an offense during his career. Tony Barrett, football writer for the Times newspaper who watched Suarez on a weekly basis during his time at Liverpool, says the forward can only blame himself for his absence from the list of nominees. ""On the basis of his outstanding form last season, Luis Suarez's omission from the nominees for the Ballon d'Or is staggering,"" Barrett told CNN. ""By common consensus, the forward was among world football's best performing players as he inspired a wholly unexpected title challenge from Liverpool. ""In terms of form, ability and performance levels, any list of the world's top players over the last 12 months which does not include Suarez will inevitably provoke debate and, in some cases, shock. ""The only conclusion to be drawn is that his bite on Chiellini cost him inclusion and, as ever, Suarez has only himself to blame for this. ""Regardless of that, his standing as a player has already been reflected in more meaningful fashion by the fact that Barcelona were willing to pay Â£75 million to sign him."" While the debate over Suarez continues to rage, Ronaldo and Messi are likely to go head-to-head once again, while there are several other candidates who will fancy their chances. Brazil and Barcelona star Neymar is on the list alongside the likes of Real Madrid quartet Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez and Sergio Ramos . Bayern Munich and Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer enjoyed a fine year, helping his club win the league title before lifting the World Cup in Brazil. Neuer's Bayern teammate, Arjen Robben, who helped the Netherlands qualify for the semifinals in Brazil, is also in with a shout. Bayern captain Phillip Lahm is on the list alongside teammate Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario Gotze, the man who scored the winner in the World Cup final. Five players from England's Premier League have been nominated including Manchester City's Yaya Toure, Manchester United's Angel Di Maria and the Chelsea trio of Eden Hazard, Diego Costa and goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. France and Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is the sole representative from Serie A, while Ligue 1 is boosted by the presence of Paris Saint-Germain and Sweden forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic. In the managerial stakes, 10 nominees have been named including Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho -- despite his failure to win a trophy last season. Joachim Low, the man who led Germany to victory at the World Cup will be one of the favorites to be named as coach of the year. Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti, who led his club to Champions League glory last term, is joined by Pep Guardiola of Bayern Munich, Manuel Pellegrini of Manchester City and Diego Simeone, who presided over Atletico Madrid's title win in Spain last season. There is also room for Alejandro Sabella, who took Argentina to the World Cup final, Louis van Gaal of Manchester United, Antonio Conte of Italy and Jurgen Klinsmann, coach of Team USA.","The 23-name longlist for the Ballon d'Or has been revealed .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- The latest attempt at a cease-fire in Gaza disintegrated Friday before it ever really took hold amid accusations that Palestinian militants killed two Israeli soldiers and captured one. Blaming Hamas and its militant allies for the attack on the soldiers, Israel resumed shelling of what have been described as militant strongholds in Gaza. The announced 72-hour humanitarian cease-fire between Israel and Hamas didn't even last two hours, by some accounts. The pause appears to have eroded after about 90 minutes in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza, with the attack on Israeli soldiers. The soldiers were working to destroy a tunnel built by militants to breach Israel's border when a militant emerged from it and detonated a suicide bomb, Israeli military Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Around that time, Palestinian sources told CNN they could hear shelling in the area. The Gaza Health Ministry said an Israeli attack on Rafah killed at least 62 people and wounded 350. Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan denied the group had captured a soldier. ""It's clear that the capture of the soldier is an Israeli story; there's nothing from the resistance saying there was a capture,"" he told CNN. The Israel Defense Forces told a different version, saying its troops in Rafah were attacked in a ""brutal incident"" that required them to defend themselves. At the same time, rockets were fired from Gaza into southern Israel, Mark Regev, spokesman for Israel's Prime Minister, told CNN. The IDF identified the soldier as 2nd Lt. Hadar Goldin. By late Friday, there was no claim of responsibility for the capture of the soldier. But there was speculation about his fate took a turn after the militant group, the al Qassam Brigades, announced it lost contact with a group of its fighters in the Rafah area -- the same area where Goldin was reportedly taken. In a statement posted on the brigade's website, the group says it assumes that all of the fighters were killed in an Israeli airstrike, including possibly a soldier that Israel claims was captured. The statement stopped short of definitively saying the soldier was captured, using the phrasing ""assuming he was captured by the fighters."" Future cease-fire? U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the attack on the Israeli soldiers ""an outrageous violation of the cease-fire."" It was a sentiment echoed by U.S. President Barack Obama, who told reporters that he was holding Hamas responsible. ""I want to make sure they are listening. If they are serious about a cease-fire, that soldier needs to be unconditionally released,"" Obama told reporters in Washington. He went on to say that when Hamas signs on to a cease-fire, the group is saying it's in control of the Palestinian factions. ""I think it's going to be very hard to put a cease-fire back together again, if Israelis and the international community can't be confident that Hamas"" will honor it, Obama said. At the same time, the President called the issue of the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza ""heartbreaking."" While Obama said Israel has the right to protect itself, he said the United States has been ""clear that innocent civilians in Gaza caught in the crossfire have to weigh on our conscience, and we have to do more to protect them."" With the conflict in its fourth week, more than 1,600 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza. Of the casualties, the United Nations has estimated between 70% and 80% are civilians. Since Israel began Operation Protective Edge against Hamas on July 8, three civilians have been killed in Israel. Sixty-one Israeli soldiers have been killed during the hostilities, the IDF has said. In an overwhelming bipartisan vote, 395-8, the House on Friday gave final congressional approval for another $225 million to support Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system. The Senate passed the measure earlier Friday. Who's behind the attack? If the attack on the soldiers in Rafah is corroborated, it would be a violation by Gaza militants of the cease-fire that had been in place, said Robert Serry, U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process. The violation would be ""condemned in the strongest terms,"" he said. However, the office of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon clarified that the ""U.N. has no independent means to verify exactly what happened."" The narrative emerging from Washington was that Hamas used the cease-fire as cover to attack the soldiers in the tunnel. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest and U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken used this same language in remarks Friday. Earnest called the turn of events ""rather barbaric."" But the military wing of Hamas disputes that. According to the al Qassam Brigades, they carried out an attack on Israeli troops before the cease-fire took effect. In a statement, the group mentions that Israeli soldiers were killed as a result of the battle, but does not mention the capture of a soldier. A second Hamas spokesman said Israel broke the Friday cease-fire before and after the hiatus by advancing its forces near civilian areas in Rafah and by occupying civilian homes to use as sniper positions. 1 killed in West Bank protest . Before the cease-fire plan was announced, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said Israeli troops would continue destroying Hamas' network of tunnels that run under the border into Israel with or without a truce. Hamdan, the Hamas spokesman, said that this part of the truce was not communicated to his group. He said Hamas' understanding was that there would be no military activity at all. A U.N. spokesman said it was very clear the Israeli's would continue destroying the tunnels. ""Perhaps some will deny that now,"" said Jeffery Feltman, undersecretary-general for public affairs. ""But, yes, it was very clear in the diplomacy being done yesterday. ... The Israelis never ceased saying that."" Inside a Hamas tunnel . What is Hamas' endgame in Gaza? What is Israel's endgame in Gaza? The conflict has caused outrage around the world, including in the Palestinian West Bank, where thousands protested on Friday. One Palestinian was killed in Tulkarem during clashes with the Israeli military, Palestinian paramedics told CNN. The Arab world has been accused of being silent on the Gaza conflict, but Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah on Friday released a statement condemning the violence. Palestinians ""are being subjected to mass massacres and crimes against humanity without any humane or moral grounds to the point that terrorism has taken different forms,"" King Abdullah said. ""Especially the state sponsored terrorism which is the most dangerous form."" Hamas has said it wants an end to Israel's blockade on Gaza, which restricts the movement of goods and people. It also wants the release of prisoners detained by the Israelis. Israel, meanwhile, says it is aiming for the demilitarization of Hamas-controlled Gaza, removing the threat that militant weapons pose to Israeli civilians.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- On Friday morning, a man walked through the entrance of an elementary school and, without warning, began ruthlessly cutting down children at the school. Before he was subdued, nearly two dozen were hit. While it sounds like the horrific massacre in Connecticut, this attack took place about 8,000 miles away in central China. And while several of the victims were reported in critical condition, none of the 22 children were killed. The 36-year-old suspect in China -- which has strict gun control laws -- attacked the children with a knife, according to local reports. ""The huge difference between this case and the U.S. is not the suspect, nor the situation, but the simple fact he did not have an effective weapon,"" said Dr. Ding Xueliang, a Harvard-educated sociologist at the University of Science and Technology in Hong Kong. As the world shares in the horror of the attack that left at least 28 dead, including 20 school children, the attack has rekindled the gun-control debate in the U.S. and international wonder at the propensity of gun-related deaths in America. Police: 20 children among 26 victims of Sandy Hook School shooting . ""In terms of the U.S., there's much easier availability of killing instruments -- rifles, machine guns, explosives -- than in nearly every other developed country,"" Dr. Ding said. ""In the United States, we had 9,000 people killed with guns last year, in similar countries like Germany 170 (killed with guns), in Canada 150. There's a reason for that,"" Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""The proof in the pudding is that in every other industrialized nation except the United States, they have reasonable gun control laws, and they have hundreds of people killed each year -- not 9,000 or 10,000 a year -- killed by guns."" Analysis: Why gun controls are off the agenda in America . The United States has, by far, the highest rate of gun ownership in the world, with 88.8 guns per 100 people, followed by Serbia (58.2), Yemen (54.8) and Finland/Switzerland (45.7 each), according to GunPolicy.org, an international database at the University of Sydney. While nations such as South Africa, El Salvador and Thailand have much higher rates of gun homicides per year, the United States rate of 3.12 deaths per 100,000 people is the highest among industrialized nations.

In July 2011, a gunman killed 77 people in a bomb attack and gun rampage in Norway. Anders Behring Breivik was sentenced to 21 years in prison for the crime last August. In 1996 a gunman killed 16 children and their teacher in the town of Dunblane, Scotland. The year before that, 35 people were killed in a shooting in Port Arthur, Tasmania. The attack Friday in China recalled a spate of fatal attacks by knife and cleaver-wielding culprits targeting school children in 2010. In April that year, Chinese authorities executed a man who killed eight children in a knife attack the month before. There were three more attacks in the same year injuring at least 44 children. Read more: Who was the suspect Adam Lanza? A number of measures were introduced at the time, including increased security at schools across the country and a regulation requiring people to register with their national ID cards when buying large knives. Dr. Ding, the Hong Kong sociologist, said mainland China schools he has visited in the past two years have beefed up security in the wake of the knife attacks. ""I think these kind of attacks become more frequent in many countries, not just China and U.S., because of a number of different factors,"" Ding said. ""Number one is the increased pressure for individuals. Today's world is very different from the world we saw 50 years ago ... individuals in their daily life face much more uncertainty, risk, financial pressure and competition."" ""The second thing is we live in a global village now, where the spread of information -- especially bad news -- is so instantaneous,"" said Ding, leading to more copycat crimes across the globe. ""I don't think we should limit the free press ... but people are watching this, they are learning from these kind of attacks. They are becoming more and more organized, better planned -- and that is horrible.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The field of potential Republican presidential candidates in 2016 might have just gained one more name: Sen. Lindsey Graham. Known for his hawkish foreign policy approach, the South Carolina Republican told the Weekly Standard in a story published Friday that he'll enter the race if he thinks he's the most competent messenger for a more aggressive foreign policy approach. ""If I get through my general election, if nobody steps up in the presidential mix, if nobody's out there talking — me and McCain have been talking — I may just jump in to get to make these arguments,"" Graham told the Weekly Standard. Graham has called for airstrikes in Iraq and Syria to fight terrorism, a position that aligns well with some 69 percent of Republicans who identify themselves as ""hawks"" according to a CNN/ORC poll last week. The senator, who maintains an 18-point lead over his Democratic opponent in his campaign for a third term, emerged as a vocal critic of the White House in 2012 when four Americans were killed in an attack at the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. When it comes to one other possible 2016 hopeful, Sen. Marco Rubio, Graham says the Florida Republican's relative inexperience could be a disqualifier. ""He's a good guy, but after doing immigration with him — we don't need another young guy not quite ready,"" Graham said in the Weekly Standard interview. ""He's no Obama by any means, but he's so afraid of the right, and I've let that go."" Though a presidential bid for Graham, 59, is likely a long shot, he's earned accolades from McCain if he were to throw his hat in the ring. ""I've strongly encouraged him to give it a look,"" McCain said. ""I think Lindsey has vast and deep experience on these issues that very few others have.""","Sen. Lindsey Graham fuels speculation on a potential 2016 presidential bid.

"(CNN) -- The worst measles outbreak in 20 years continues to grow. Most recently, there was a new case in Ohio, where there are already 377 cases. So far this year, measles has infected 593 people in 21 states. As a physician who treats children with compromised immune systems and as a mother of 2-year-old twins -- too young to be fully vaccinated, I am deeply concerned. A few months ago, a 4-year-old girl came to my clinic with frequent cold symptoms and infections. One way to see if her immune system functioned properly was to check her response to childhood vaccines. But because the girl's mother had decided against vaccinating her, I could not perform the vaccine blood test. My hands were tied behind my back; I had no way of knowing if there was a deficiency in her immune system. And if she did have a deficiency, she had no protection from the potentially deadly diseases the vaccines are designed to inoculate. As it turned out, she didn't have a life-threatening infection -- this time. Her parents and I breathed a sigh of relief. We can't know for sure that the anti-vaccine movement, led by uninformed celebrities and discredited research, is the reason we are having such a terrible measles outbreak in the United States. But certainly it's not helping our children. Before measles vaccinations were available, every year in the United States, approximately 500,000 people were infected with measles and 500 died. That number fell to around 60 infections annually after vaccinations were introduced in 1994. The Vaccines for Children program, implemented in 1994, helped lead to the eradication of measles by the year 2000. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in the last 20 years, vaccinations prevented 322 million illnesses and 732,000 deaths, while saving $295 billion. Now, we can add measles to the list of illnesses that are crawling back out of the dustbin of history. Cases of measles have been on the rise since 2010, and globally, 14 people die from measles every hour. The CDC reports the majority of those who have contracted measles were not vaccinated. Some of the outbreaks have been from unvaccinated U.S. citizens getting measles abroad and bringing it back to those not vaccinated in the United States. The trend of not receiving vaccinations has been fueled by many, including Jenny McCarthy. The son of the former co-host of ""The View"" was diagnosed with autism in 2007. Since then she has been fervently critical of vaccination, claiming vaccines such as those for measles, mumps and rubella cause autism. She founded an organization for the cause, wrote books on the topic and made countless appearances -- all the while arguing, absent any scientific data, that vaccines cause autism. McCarthy's views have been influential in fanning parents' fears of vaccinating their children. She backtracked her stance on vaccines in an op-ed she wrote in April 2014, claiming she is not ""anti-vaccine,"" but the damage has been done. Another harmful influence was former British surgeon and researcher Andrew Wakefield. In 1998, he presented a highly publicized Lancet report connecting autism and vaccines. Later, the study was discredited by many sources. In 2010, the British General Medical Council declared his paper linking vaccine and autism was not only based on bad science, but also a deliberate fraud. For his unethical behavior he lost his medical license. But his fraudulent work has contributed to a decrease in vaccinations and increase in measles. The only credible association between autism and vaccine is age. When a child is diagnosed with a developmental delay such as autism, parents naturally search for a cause and look to recent events in the child's life. Since the age of onset of autism is similar to when children receive vaccinations, some parents falsely connect these two unrelated events. Autism, in fact, appears to be rising among unvaccinated children as well. While parents have a right to be skeptical and well-informed when it comes to their children's health, they must not make medical decisions based on unfounded diatribes from a celebrity or fraudulent medical paper. 5 things you don't know about measles . Measles outbreaks in our own backyard should prompt educated discussion with patient families who are not vaccinated. We have many credible studies demonstrating that the advantages of vaccination outweigh the disadvantages. Vaccines reduce the threat of disease or death by a particular pathogen. Unvaccinated children face challenges when it comes to getting lifesaving care. Every 911 call, doctor appointment, or emergency room visit, you must alert medical personnel of your child's vaccination status so he receives distinctive treatment. Because unvaccinated children can require treatment that is out of the ordinary, medical staff may be less experienced with the procedures required to appropriately treat your unvaccinated child. As was the case with the 4-year-old patient I saw, doctors are not be able to adequately assess a patient's health if the patient is not vaccinated. During pregnancy, women who are not vaccinated can be vulnerable to diseases that may complicate their pregnancy. If an unvaccinated pregnant woman contracts rubella, her baby may have congenital rubella syndrome, causing heart defects, developmental delays and deafness. Choosing to not vaccinate your child not only puts your own child at risk, but it also puts others at risk if their child isn't protected. Some people cannot be vaccinated because of other medical conditions, such as cancer. These people rely on the general public being vaccinated so their risk of exposure is reduced. According to CDC statistics comparing pre-vaccine era deaths to now, there has been a 99% decrease in measles. I know I will continue to give my own children vaccinations to protect their life and health. I urge everyone to do the same for the sake of all children.","The U.S. is experiencing the worst measles outbreak in 20 years .
Jennifer Shih: The anti-vaccine movement can be blamed for scaring parents .
She says widespread vaccination was responsible for eradicating measles years ago .

"(CNN) -- Amanda Bynes has hit rough road yet again. The 28-year-old actress was arrested on a DUI charge early Sunday morning in Sherman Oaks, California, Officer Juan Galvan with the California Highway Patrol confirmed to CNN. CHP officers said they observed Bynes driving her white Mercedes Benz SUV west on Riverside Drive, where she stopped for a red light in the middle of an intersection. Bynes immediately pulled over for the highway patrol and according to police failed to pass a series of field sobriety tests. Officers transported her to the West Valley CHP office for evaluation by a drug recognition expert. Bynes was then arrested for allegedly driving under the influence of a drug and booked at the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys Jail shortly after 7 a.m. The CHP arrest report notes Bynes' ""disheveled appearance,"" but indicates she was cooperative throughout the entire arrest process. Bynes' attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The former child star of Nickelodeon's ""All That"" and ""The Amanda Show"" was placed in an involuntary psychiatric hold last year. She had earlier been charged with a DUI after an April 2012 inident in which Bynes' BMW allegedly sideswiped a police cruiser in West Hollywood. In February 2014 that DUI charge was dismissed in a plea deal that gave the actress three years on probation, a requirement to attend an alcohol education course and pay a fine after she entered a no-contest plea to reckless driving. Amanda Bynes gets probation in DUI plea deal . Last December, following her detainment for the mental health evaluation, Bynes was in custody of her parents in California. She has been splitting her time between treatment and studying at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. Her once controversial Twitter page -- where she posted photos in brightly colored wigs and professed her disdain for ""ugly"" people -- was most recently filled with sunny tweets about fashion and family vacations. The actress has remained silent on Twitter since May.","Police said the actress was arrested on Sunday morning .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Any author or filmmaker seeking ideas for a sci-fi yarn about the implications of artificial intelligence -- good or bad -- would be smart to talk to Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, the acclaimed inventor and futurist, believes that humans and technology are blurring -- note the smartphone appendages in almost everyone's hand -- and will eventually merge. ""We are a human-machine civilization. Everybody has been enhanced with computer technology,"" he told a capacity crowd of more than 3,000 tech-savvy listeners Monday at the South by Southwest Interactive conference. ""They're really part of who we are. ""If we can convince people that computers have complexity of thought and nuance ... we'll come to accept them as human."" A pioneer in the field of speech recognition, Kurzweil is perhaps best known for his bestseller, ""The Singularity is Near,"" which predicts that in the future we will augment our bodies with technology, including robotics and artificial intelligence. ""We created these tools to extend our reach,"" he said -- something we've been doing as humans ""ever since we first picked up a stick to reach a tree branch."" Asked by interviewer Lev Grossman whether artificial intelligence will lead to malevolent machines that will come to dominate humans, he said he was more concerned about what humans will do to themselves. ""I don't see it as 'us vs. them.' I see it as 'us vs. us.' "" Kurzweil believes technology is advancing at exponential speed -- so fast that previously unimaginable inventions will be a reality within decades. He cited nanotechnology -- microscopic computers -- that will be 1,000 times more powerful than human blood cells and injected in people's bloodstreams to give them superhuman endurance. He also believes computer technology is democratizing society by empowering anyone with creativity and and a broadband connection. ""You can start world-changing revolution with the power of your ideas and the tools that everyone has,"" he said. ""A kid in Africa has access to more information than the president of the United States did 15 years ago."" The 64-year-old author made a few other bold predictions in his hourlong talk: . -- ""It's an amazing threshold that people are talking to computers [in natural language],"" he said, when asked about Apple's Siri. ""Siri is only going to get better."" -- Moore's Law, the rule of thumb that the pace of innovation in computer technology doubles every 18 months to two years, will come to an end by 2020. -- ""As we go through this decade, search engines aren't going to wait to be asked. They'll be listening [to humans] in the background. And [the search results] will just pop up.""","Ray Kurzweil, the acclaimed inventor and futurist, believes that humans and technology are merging .

"(CNN) -- ""I've always only been interested in trying to make people laugh,"" Conan O'Brien told Piers Morgan, ""and trying to be funny and make things that would have made me laugh, you know? Or my brothers laugh, or my sisters laugh, or my parents laugh. That's always been the motivation for me."" The host of TBS's (sister station to CNN) ""Conan"" is a guest on tonight's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" ""It starts with the family,"" O'Brien told the CNN host. ""I'm from a large Irish-Catholic family and trying, the benchmark, for me, is trying to make my dad laugh or trying to make my brothers laugh at the table when we were having meals together."" The third of six children, O'Brien and his two older brothers, one younger brother and two younger sisters grew up in the Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts. O'Brien, 49, who began doing Charlie Chaplin impersonations in the third grade, recalled wanting to take tap dance lessons as a child in the 1970s. ""I grew up on old movies,"" explained O'Brien, who said he loved gangster movies and the films of Humphrey Bogart. When ""That's Entertainment"" was released in 1974, the young O'Brien was convinced he had to know how to tap dance in order to make it in show business. ""It's showing you what entertainment is,"" recalled O'Brien. ""I thought, like an idiot in the 1970s, that that was what entertainers needed to have to know. You have to be like Donald O'Connor or Gene Kelly. You've got to know how to sing, dance, move. You've got to know how to do it all."" O'Brien said that his mother, a lawyer, and his father, a microbiologist, thought he was bluffing, but encouraged him to follow his dream nonetheless. ""They found me this really old African-American gentleman,"" said O'Brien, ""who had been the protÃ©gÃ© of Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson. And he... worked out of this dilapidated studio and taught all these... people how to dance. I was the only white kid there... Not only that, I was tiny and I had bright orange hair... So all these beautiful black women are learning jazz, tap and all this kind of stuff and then I would march in with my box of tiny shoes..."" When Morgan pointed out that O'Brien doesn't possess the ""agony"" and the ""torment"" that plagues a lot of successful comics, the ""Conan"" host admitted that he has always grappled with insecurity. ""I was always a very hard-working student and wanted to go to a good school and worked really hard to go to a good school,"" said O'Brien, who attended Harvard University. ""And then when I got there, I immediately had the fear that a lot of people have, which is, I don't belong here. These other people know a lot more than I do. They're smarter. I'm the fake. I'm the phony. And I think that is the common denominator that you see with a lot of people, whether they're artists or performers. They don't think that they belong."" Getting into comedy, O'Brien said, ""was a very beautiful accident, because I worked very hard at everything and I tried really hard. Comedy was something that I stumbled into when I was in college."" O'Brien soon began writing for the college humor magazine. ""It was like falling off a log and discovering what it is that I was meant to do,"" he said. ""I loved it. I absolutely loved it."" After Harvard, O'Brien moved to Los Angeles and landed a sketch comedy writing gig with the then-fledgling Fox Network. The show he was writing for flopped, but O'Brien was hired shortly thereafter as a writer for ""Saturday Night Live."" After ""SNL,"" Conan struck out on his own and wrote an original sitcom. The pilot fared terribly in the ratings. O'Brien then wrote for ""The Simpsons"" before being selected to take over David Letterman's spot at NBC's ""Late Night"" in 1993. O'Brien's string of successes and failures were the basis of his 2000 Harvard commencement address. ""I've looked good, I've looked bad, I've been praised, I've been criticized,"" his speech read, ""but my mistakes have been necessary. I've dwelled on my failure today, because as a graduate of Harvard, your biggest liability is your need to succeed, your need to always find yourself on the sweet side of the bell curve. Success is a lot like a bright white tuxedo. You feel terrific when you get it, but then you're desperately afraid of getting it dirty, of spoiling it."" Back in 2004, O'Brien had negotiated a contract with NBC to take over ""The Tonight Show"" from Jay Leno in 2009. ""The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien"" debuted on June 1, 2009. But in January 2010, NBC announced that Leno would begin hosting ""The Jay Leno Show"" at 11:35 p.m., thus pushing ""The Tonight Show's"" start time to 12:05 a.m. Unhappy with this plan, O'Brien struck a deal with NBC that permitted him to leave ""The Tonight Show,"" which Leno again took over. This freed O'Brien up to negotiate with other networks, and he went to TBS. ""Conan"" debuted on November 8, 2010 and airs weeknights at 11. ""I'm honestly happier now... this feels... like a greater achievement... because I'm doing exactly the show I want to do. I'm doing it with people that I love. And we get to do it our way, and we're with these amazing partners at Turner."" O'Brien and Leno have not spoken since the ""Tonight Show"" fallout. ""I just think life throws you a lot of curveballs,"" said O'Brien, ""and this is something that I didn't agree with, and I thought it was pretty screwed up, but we, everyone went through it.

"(CNN) -- The African elephant, one of the world's most majestic animals, is in danger. In the early 1900s, 5 million elephants roamed the African continent. Then the ivory trade drove them to the brink of extinction, with 90% of African elephants killed for the ivory in their tusks. In 1989, the world reacted, imposing a ban on the international trade in ivory passed by the U.N. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Elephant populations stabilized. But today, driven by growing demand for ivory ornaments and carvings in Asia, particularly in China, elephant poaching has returned with a vengeance. The largest slaughter in one year since the 1989 ban was passed happened in 2012, with up to 35,000 elephants killed. This adds up to nearly 100 a day. Tens of thousands are killed every year. Without action, the day may come when this magnificent creature is known only in history books. Estimates say if elephants continue to be slaughtered at today's rates, the creatures could be extinct in a decade. Not only do elephants die. The wildlife rangers who try to protect them from poachers are being killed. The illicit trade in ivory -- ""white gold"" -- is a billion dollar industry, and because it is illegal, it tends to attract some very bad actors. It is blood ivory: Al-Shabaab, a wing of al Qaeda based in Africa that is responsible for continued instability in Somalia, is known to finance its operations through the poaching of elephants. Al-Shabaab raises an estimated $600,000 a month through the ivory trade. The Lord's Resistance Army, another terrorist group infamous for forcing children to fight in its ranks, also engages in poaching and trafficking of elephant ivory. Stopping the ivory trade has become not only a matter of conservation but one of national security and international stability. Last year, the United Nations issued a report warning that elephant poaching is the worst it has been in a decade, while ivory seizures are at their highest levels since 1989. Last summer, President Barack Obama issued an executive order recognizing that the poaching of protected species and the illicit trade in ivory has become an international crisis that the United States must take a leading role in combating. Saving elephants and other threatened species is a cause that cuts across partisan lines and international boundaries. We all have a part to play. It starts in our personal lives. The ivory trade prospers because there is a demand for luxury goods fashioned from it. As consumers, we should never buy products made with ivory and should encourage others to be mindful that their purchases are not illegally sourced through trafficking. And we should continue to shine a spotlight on the problem of illegal poaching and the threat it poses to African elephants and other species. There are actions our government can take, as well. As co-chairman of the U.S. Senate International Conservation Caucus, I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to educate members of Congress on these ongoing problems and introduce legislation that authorizes proven conservation programs and directs resources to the international effort to dismantle the machinery of illegal poaching. The Conservation Reform Act is part of this effort. If passed, it would streamline and increase the effectiveness of our existing international conservation efforts. I am also working to reauthorize the Saving Vanishing Species Stamp, which raises funds for the protection of threatened animals and their habitat at no cost to the U.S. taxpayer. Over the years, we have watched as the actions of a few shortsighted, malicious and greedy people have nearly destroyed whole species. If we act now, we can make sure that the African elephant doesn't become another sad entry on a long list of animals we can never bring back. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rob Portman.","Rob Portman: The world almost killed off elephants completely before the ban on ivory in 1989 .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China conjures various images. It could be food -- Peking Duck, steamed dumplings and the like. Or kung fu -- Bruce Lee and his dazzling martial-arts skills or more recently Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Or the giant pandas -- those cuddly creatures as photographed in the nature reserves or as portrayed in the Hollywood blockbuster, ""Kung Fu Panda."" Or Yao Ming -- the other cuddly giant who, until he retired last year, won games and friends in the NBA. Stereotypical or not, these are some of China's ""soft power"" resources. In recent months, China has been on a ""soft power"" offensive to improve its national image and increase its global influence. China has hosted the 2008 Olympics and the Shanghai Expo in 2009 -- expensive events which, many experts say, helped enhance the ""China brand."" ""The Olympics was very much a positive move in improving China's Soft Power,"" said Scott Kronick, president for Ogilvy PR in North Asia, which advises Chinese and overseas clients. ""How the country responded to the Sichuan earthquake was another."" There are long-term initiatives, too, such as the setting up of Confucius Institutes to promote the Chinese language and culture. Akin to Germany's Goethe Institut or the British Council, hundreds of these Confucius Institutes have been established in leading universities and colleges around the world. ""There is a sense that soft power is growing, as more foreigners are aware of China's successes, get exposed more to its culture and have to consider China's views on a whole range of global issues,"" noted John Holden, Beijing-based adviser at Hill+Knowlton, a U.S. public relations company. Why China's obsession to project its ""soft power""? Soft power, according to Harvard Kennedy School professor Joseph S. Nye, ""is the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments."" Nye cites three ways to affect the behavior of others: . â€¢ You can coerce them with threats, using military power. â€¢ You can induce them with payments, using economic clout. â€¢ Or you can attract and co-opt them, using culture, diplomacy and other means and resources. ""The latter is soft power -- getting others to appreciate you to the extent that their behavior is modified,"" explained Kronick of Ogilvy. ""When the first two are exercised judiciously and are combined with the third, they create 'smart power.'"" ""The Chinese want to exercise greater soft power,"" Kronick added. ""How they do this is an ongoing challenge and pursuit."" As China becomes richer, modernizes its military and increasingly consumes greater global resources, experts see a growing global concern over China's rise as a global power. Optimists say China will turn into a benign power. Alarmists warn China is bound to emerge as an Evil Empire. In a white paper issued in 2005, China outlined its intentions to rise peacefully as a global power. ""China did not seek hegemony in the past, nor does it and will not do so in the future when it gets stronger,"" the white paper said. ""China's development will not pose a threat to anyone; instead it can bring more development opportunities and bigger markets for the rest of the world."" But some public opinion polls show China's soft power offensive remains inadequate. A survey by the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Projects last year noted a significant rise in positive views in a number of countries. However, across the 22 nations surveyed, the U.S. generally received more favorable marks than China. In the U.S., France, Germany, Spain and Japan, the survey showed, those who see China as the world's leading economic power believed this is a bad thing. Those who named the United States tended to think it is a good thing. Experts partly blame this on poor communications. Ahead of China's transition of leadership later this year, China has tightened its control of the media and continued its repression of dissent. ""China hurts itself when it flouts its own laws and international norms on human rights,"" Holden said. ""This tarnishes its image."" ""What they do wrong is that they traditionally have had a tendency to only want to project positive news, and this often is seen clouding the truth,"" Kronick noted. Zhao Qizheng, the former director of the State Council Information Office and an advocate of public diplomacy, acknowledges the limits of official propaganda. ""For a long time, the international community has been cynical towards the traditional Chinese voice, believing that it's mostly official propaganda with political agenda, so it's not very credible and interesting,"" Zhao said in a recent online forum. Zhao admonished ordinary Chinese to engage in public diplomacy. ""We Chinese should be good at storytelling, to use soft ways of communications to create the so-called 'China image,'"" he said. Experts -- like James McGregor, a veteran China-watcher and senior counselor at APCO Worldwide, a public relations consulting company -- agree. ""The Chinese students, the emigrants and business people who are scattered around the world -- and the Chinese individuals whom foreigners meet in China -- are the country's soft power. They have many friends and admirers who through them have great affection for the Chinese people, their incredible work ethic and accomplishments,"" he said. After 30 years of rapid economic and social changes, China struggles to project an international profile that befits the second biggest economy in the world. McGregor thinks China's dilemma is more deep-seated and long-term. ""I think the world respects China's economic accomplishments and has great admiration for the Chinese people,"" he said. ""But the Chinese government has almost no soft power in the world. You need a leading ideology that resonates with the world and a system of ethics and governing that people admire. China doesn't have that right now.""","China on ""soft power"" offensive to improve image, increase influence .
