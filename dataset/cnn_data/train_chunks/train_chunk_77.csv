"(CNN) -- Thousands of demonstrators marched through cities across Europe on Saturday, calling for an immediate end to Israel's attacks on Gaza. A protester swings a club at a police horse Saturday night near London's Israeli Embassy. Up to 20,000 people were gathered outside the Israeli Embassy in London, England, at the peak of protests there, London Metropolitan Police said. A police officer was knocked unconscious Saturday night as the protests turned unruly, the police said. The London crowd dismantled barriers placed in front of the embassy and began pelting officers with sticks, rocks and pieces of the metal barriers, police said. Three people were arrested. Organizers including the Stop the War Coalition and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign expected more than 100,000 people to join the London march to protest Israel's ongoing attacks on Gaza. Celebrities including musician Annie Lennox and Bianca Jagger, musician Mick Jagger's ex-wife, spoke at a rally before the procession, which went from Hyde Park to the Israeli Embassy in Kensington, West London.  Watch demonstrators throw bottles, metal at police » . Lauren Booth, the sister-in-law of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, also spoke at the rally, The Times newspaper reported. During her speech, Booth criticized Blair over his attempts to bring about a resolution to the conflict. ""Tony Blair's only comment regarding the cease-fire has been to say that it can only take place after the tunnels in Gaza are destroyed,"" The Times quoted her as saying. ""What he is suggesting means that after the massacre, people will have no access to food, kerosene and medicines that came through those tunnels. That is not a cease-fire; that is a slow agonizing death,"" she said, according to The Times. Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone issued a statement backing the demonstration. ""Every day, we see appalling pictures of children slaughtered by Israeli bombs, missiles and other sophisticated weapons,"" he said. ""Yet with more than 700 dead and thousands more seriously wounded, the international community is allowing Israel to continue its completely disproportionate onslaught accompanied by an Orwellian litany of lies."" Meanwhile, the British Press Association reported that similar demonstrations took place in other British cities, including Newcastle and Edinburgh. Thousands took part in a rally through the center of Edinburgh calling for an end to the military campaign. About 300 shoes and red paint were thrown toward the U.S. consulate in the Scottish capital, the PA said. Thousands demonstrated in other European cities, according to local media reports, including Innsbruck, Austria; Paris, France; Milan, Italy; Berlin, Germany; and Oslo, Norway. iReport: Protests in Paris . In Washington, pro-Palestinian activists rallied outside the temporary residence of President-elect Barack Obama on Saturday and called on the incoming leader to stop the violence in Gaza. About 3,000 people carrying signs and chanting ""Free Palestine"" flooded Lafayette Park between the White House and the Hay-Adams Hotel, where the president-elect is living with his family. Carrying a flag and wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh head scarf, Abdel-Kader Elkabil exhorted the president-elect to take action. ""Please, Mr. Obama, do something. We love you. We voted for you,"" he said. ""I'm expecting you to do something. ... You're the only one who can do something."" Asma Mobin-Uddin drove to Washington with a group of 500 activists from Ohio. She said she voted for Obama because she believed he could ""make a difference."" ""President Obama, look in the eyes of your kids and look in the eyes of the kids in that region,"" she said at the rally. ""Please, stop the violence, stop the hate, stop the occupation."" Israelis say their Gaza military operation, which started December 27, is targeting rocket-launching sites, Hamas infrastructure and the movement's leaders in an effort to stop militants from sending rockets into southern Israel. Palestinian medical sources said that more than 800 Palestinians have been killed in the attacks, including 235 children, and about 3,300 people have been wounded. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, have died since the operation began.

"Concepcion, Chile (CNN) -- Aid and increased security were flowing Wednesday into hard-hit areas of Chile, but some residents complained that they still had not received food or water since Saturday's massive earthquake killed more than 800 people. President Michelle Bachelet urged residents Wednesday to remain calm despite the shortages and lawlessness in Concepcion, Talcahuano and other areas of central and southern Chile. For the second consecutive day, she also warned that looting will not be tolerated. ""Nobody can argue that taking a refrigerator is an act of survival,"" Bachelet said. ""That is simply vandalism and delinquency."" An overnight curfew remained in effect for the third day in Concepcion, the scene of the worst looting. Authorities said they would take whatever steps are necessary to keep order, and 35 people were arrested for curfew violations. A military presence and citizen patrols appeared to maintain order in the nation's second-largest city, though CNN's Sara Sidner said that about 10 percent of the stores in the downtown business district appeared to have been looted. ""There was a moment when this was no-man's land,"" one resident said. ""This place was like the Wild West."" Some supermarkets were open, though checkout lines lasting two to three hours were common. The death toll increased to 802, with nearly 600 of those fatalities occurring in the Maule region, the National Emergency Office said Wednesday. Nineteen people were missing, said Patricio Rosende, the assistant interior secretary. Thirty trucks loaded with food and water arrived late Tuesday in Concepcion. The supplies were being distributed Wednesday. The city's mayor, Jacqueline Van Rysselberghe, said it was a good start but not nearly enough. The aid, she told CNN Chile, would be distributed in areas where there has been little or no looting. Concepcion is less than 10 miles inland from Talcahuano, but the two towns suffered far different fates. In Concepcion, the fatalities and injuries were largely the result of buildings that collapsed. In coastal Talcahuano, the damage was caused by a tsunami that roared into town about an hour after the quake. When the waters receded, they left large boats stranded inland. In spot, four shrimping vessels lay in a heap, stacked on top of each other. Much of the gritty port city looked as if a bomb had exploded in it: its buildings reduced to rubble, which was covered with debris. See scenes of devastation from the quake . The greatest number of deaths occurred in the Maule region, where disaster visited two cities in different ways. In the central city of Talca, an ancient municipality, the earthquake wiped out many of the older adobe structures, crushing hundreds of residents. In the coastal city of Constitucion, a large wave caused most of the deaths; officials said half of the city was damaged. Many Maule area residents said they had received no help. ""We have not received any aid from anyone. Nothing. Nothing,"" said Carlos Basoaldo, one of 6,000 residents of the coastal hamlet of Pelluhue. ""They are only concerned about the big cities,"" Basoaldo told CNN Chile. Security, too, remained a concern. The mayors of Concepcion, Hualpen and Talcahuano had urgently requested military help, and Bachelet said that more than 13,000 soldiers were being dispatched. Many of those soldiers started to reach their destinations Tuesday. But World Vision's emergency operations manager said the situation was safe enough for the non-governmental organization to distribute aid in two villages near Concepcion. ""Fortunately enough, we had the collaboration of the government and the army,"" Michael Black said from Santiago. He credited the extension of the curfew from 6 p.m. until noon. ""What emergency operations are doing is, they're trying to arrive with supplies through the city of Concepcion during the curfew,"" he said. ""That has worked really well."" Among the items distributed by the Christian humanitarian group were 10,000 blankets, 5,000 liters of water, 3 tons of food and thousands of sleeping bags, he said. Santiago, which suffered damage from the quake but was well on its way to recovery Wednesday, is about 270 miles (435 km) northeast of Concepcion. Concerns about the safety of those buildings that were damaged in the quake were heightened Wednesday afternoon, when a 5.6-magnitude aftershock struck 30 miles south southwest of Valparaiso, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Residents in coastal cities in Chile started to evacuate Wednesday after officials in the fishing village of Dichato and in the city Concepcion warned of a possible tsunami and said they had one hour to leave low-lying areas. The evacuations were halted minutes later when the National Emergency Office said there was no tsunami warning. Since Saturday's 8.8-magnitude earthquake, the region has suffered more than 120 aftershocks of 5.0 magnitude or greater, USGS Geophysicist Don Blakeman said. Eight of them have been 6.0 or stronger, he said. The aftershocks further stressed a frightened population. ""The vast majority of the population, if not everyone at this moment, has some symptoms like anxiety, fear, depression,"" said Dr. Graciela Rojas, a psychiatrist at the University of Chile's clinical hospital. ""I would say that the next three months will be a time of fear and sadness."" ""Basically, we are all under great stress,"" Dr. Matias Gonzalez, a psychiatrist at the University of Chile. ""People are afraid; they want to protect their families, and they function emotionally, not rationally."" The minister of public works said the country's major highways are open and no part of the country is isolated. In addition, Sergio Bitar said, air connections were being re-established, ports were being fixed, and food and fuel supplies were sufficient. ""There is public order,"" he said. ""It was a giant earthquake, but we are handling it well."" But Chile's economy, considered by many the most competitive in Latin America, also has taken a hit. About 70 percent of the nation's economic production has been affected, particularly fruit and mining sectors, CNN Chile said, citing analysts' observations. But officials said Wednesday that they are working to fix some sectors affected by lack of electricity and other necessities. For example, Treasury Minister Andres Velasco said, about 60 percent of the nation's banks are open. ""Our economy has dealt very well with this situation,"" Velasco said. He and Bachelet tried to reassure Chileans that there were sufficient supplies of food, fuel and other goods and urged residents not to hoard.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A legal battle has put the future of Skype in jeopardy, according to eBay, which owns the online communications system. Skype's online phone and video communication service has been incredibly popular. If Skype loses the right to use a key part of its software and can't create an adequate replacement, ""Skype's business as currently conducted would likely not be possible,"" eBay said in its quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There is no sign of Skype disappearing soon -- a relief to the more than 480 million registered users who have video or telephone conversations online through the technology. But the battle with Joltid, the company that created the piece of technology at issue, shows no sign of being resolved anytime soon, either. Joltid complains that Skype broke its licensing agreement to use the technology. Skype filed suit against Joltid in Britain, saying it could not terminate the license agreement; Joltid struck back with a counterclaim saying Skype had broken the agreement. A trial is scheduled for June 2010, eBay said in the SEC filing. ""Although Skype is confident of its legal position, as with any litigation, there is the possibility of an adverse result if the matter is not resolved through negotiation,"" eBay writes. ""Skype has begun to develop alternative software to that licensed through Joltid. However, such software development may not be successful, may result in loss of functionality or customers even if successful, and will in any event be expensive."" In an e-mail to CNN, Joltid said Skype ""accessed Joltid's source code and modified it -- Joltid then claimed a breach of license."" Skype denies any breach. ""Joltid is enforcing its rights in the courts,"" Joltid said in the e-mail. ""Like any member of the creative industries, Joltid will defend its innovations with determination.""

"(CNN) -- The man suspected to be at the center of the plot to send bombs from Yemen to the United States is a Saudi national who authorities believe has been living in Yemen for the past three years. Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri is one of Saudi Arabia's most wanted men, according to a list published by the government last year. The Saudi government described al-Asiri as an explosives and poison expert. On Friday, authorities in the United Arab Emirates and Britain found two packages with explosives that were destined for synagogues in Chicago, Illinois. U.S. investigators believe al Qaeda bomb maker al-Asiri, 28, is linked to the packages. The explosive found in the packages, PETN, is the same as the material found in the December 2009 foiled underwear bomb attack in the United States. It's a highly explosive organic compound that belongs to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin. Six grams of PETN are enough to blow a hole in the fuselage of an aircraft. Al-Asiri was also suspected in the earlier attempted bombing case, where a Nigerian man, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, is accused of trying to set off a bomb hidden in his underwear on a flight. Al-Asiri's brother, Abdullah, also appeared on the Saudi Arabia's most wanted list. According to press accounts, it was Ibrahim al-Asiri who lured his brother to the jihadist movement. In 2009, Abdullah al-Asiri died when he detonated a bomb on his body with the intent of assassinating Saudi Prince Muhammed Bin Naif, a top security official. The suicide bombing attempt failed to kill its target. A few days after that attempt, the Watan newspaper in Saudi Arabia interviewed al-Asiri's mother and sisters. Their mother described Ibrahim and Abdullah as regular teenagers growing up. ""They were not religious boys at the time. They used to listen to music and had a wide variety of friends, friends not like the ones they had later when they became more religious,"" she told Watan. One of their sisters told the newspaper that the death of their brother Ali in a car accident in 2000 was a turning point in Ibrahim and Abdullah's attitude. ""It was after that that they started swapping video tapes and cassettes on the Mujahedeen in Chechnya and Afghanistan, and they became at times distant,"" the sister said. ""Abdullah started to go out a lot with his new friends to camps known as 'preaching camps.'"" Ibrahim at one point was arrested in 2003 while trying with others to enter Iraq to wage jihad, his family told Watan. He was held in prison for nine months. Also shortly after the attempt against the Saudi prince's life, the Saudi Gazette newspaper spoke with Ibrahim and Abdullah's father, who shed some more light on the young men's upbringing. The family grew up in the Al-Jazira district of east Riyadh, he said, describing theirs as a pious family. ""We were living in Makkah two years ago and were planning to move back to Riyadh, but Abdullah and Ibrahim said they wanted to go to Medina before coming back with us,"" the father, Hassan, told the newspaper last year. ""Abdullah later contacted us to say he was out of the country, but didn't say where, and from that day on we had no more news of him until we saw his and his brother's pictures a few months ago in the media as on the list of wanted people."" CNN's Tim Lister contributed to this report.","Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri is believed to be in Yemen .

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- At Russia's urging, the U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Sunday morning aimed at defusing simmering tensions in the Korean peninsula. The meeting will take place at 11 a.m. ET on Sunday, a day after Russia had originally wanted to meet, its ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin said in a statement. Churkin blamed the U.S. delegation -- which this month heads up the security council -- for the one-day delay, adding, ""We assume that nothing will happen in the interim that would bring about further aggravation."" New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a former prominent U.S. diplomat now in the middle of an unofficial four-day trip meeting with high-level Pyongyang officials, applauded the development as something that could help skirt further military escalation. ""It's a very, very tense situation, a crisis situation,"" Richardson told CNN's Wolf Blitzer from Pyongyang. ""This is when the U.N. Security Council can be most effective."" The former U.S. energy secretary and ambassador to the United Nations met Sunday morning for one-and-a-half hours with Maj. Gen. Pak Rim Su, who leads North Korean forces in the demilitarized zone along the South Korean border. He called it a ""very tough meeting"" that included ""some progress."" Richardson told CNN that Pak was receptive to his proposal that a military hotline be set up between North Korean and South Korean forces, in order to address issues should an incident occur. Pak was also open to the governor's idea for a military commission -- with representatives from North Korea, South Korea and the United States -- to monitor disputed areas in and around the Yellow Sea. The goal, Richardson said, would be to address issues before they flared into larger confrontations. The North Korean general, separately, told Richardson that the remains of several hundred U.S. servicemen killed about six decades ago during the Korean War had recently been recovered, showing the governor pictures of some of them and a dog tag from one soldier. Pak then offered to resume joint recovery efforts with the United States. ""It was a positive gesture,"" Richardson said. Still, the governor said that the U.N. Security Council's meeting on Sunday might be an even more significant development when it comes to the regional crisis. He called China's recent statements on and Russia's leadership on the issue a positive -- saying he hoped that the council might issue a statement ""urging all sides to exercise maximum restraint (and to) cool things down."" The Security Council has five permanent members in China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. There are also 10 rotating members, which are currently Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovinia, Brazil, Gabon, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria, Turkey and Uganda. The United States, as well as Russia and Japan, have been key international players in the crisis, and Chinese officials have also conducted a series of high-level talks with North Korean and South Korean officials. On Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun reiterated his nation's strong desire to avert war, which he said would be devastating for both Korean nations and the region as a whole, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. Richardson came to North Korea at the invitation of its top nuclear negotiator as a private citizen -- with the knowledge of but not as a representative of the U.S. government -- amidst one of the region's most serious crises since the 1953 Korean War armistice. North Korea says that its South Korean counterparts are instigating tensions with planned live military exercises on and around the disputed Yeonpyeong Island. Seoul cited bad weather as its reason for pushing back the drills a day or two, which were originally scheduled between December 18 and 21, South Korea's official Yonhap News Agency reported. Saying the exercises would be in ""the inviolable territorial waters"" of North Korea, the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency warned Saturday that its forces ""will deal the second and third unpredictable self-defensive blow"" if the drills proceed. Such strikes, according to the agency, would be ""deadlier ... in terms of the powerfulness and sphere"" than its November 23 shelling of Yeonpyeong Island that left four South Koreans dead. Noting that North Korea is ""very, very provoked by this potential incident,"" Richardson said he hoped that a strong statement from the United Nations council might spur Seoul to cancel the drills and ""give both sides cover"" to tamp down their rhetoric and actions. Pak was the first non-political official to talk to Richardson, who earlier said he had a ""good meeting"" with the North's chief nuclear negotiator Kim Gye Gwan and also met with the vice minister of North Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday. Both Koreas have traded tough talk and conducted aggressive military drills in the weeks after the Yeonpyeong Island incident. The U.S. military has said it is concerned that South Korea's scheduled exercises could spark an uncontrollable clash with the North, but the State Department said the exercises are not meant to be threatening or provocative.

"(CNN) -- Tuvalu, the fourth smallest nation on the planet, has announced it aims to be totally powered by renewable energy sources by 2020. Tuvalu hopes to set an example to bigger nations by relying totally on clean energy by 2020. Located between Hawaii and Australia, the tiny Pacific nation is one of the world's climate change hotspots and many believe it is already seeing the negative affects of rising sea levels. The highest elevation on the island is just 4.5 meters (14.8 feet), and king tides have become increasingly damaging over the past 10 years, threatening the homes and livelihoods of its 12,000 inhabitants. The government of Tuvalu is working with the e8, a consortium of 10 energy firms from the G8 nations that was set up after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit as a non-profit organization. The Tuvalu government estimates that it will take around $20 million in investment to reach the goal of 100 percent clean energy by 2020. The first stage of the project has seen the roof of the country's largest football stadium covered in solar panels, which supplies 5 percent of the electricity needed by the nation's capital, Funafuti. According to e8 figures, after 14 months in operation the solar stadium has reduced consumption of generator fuel shipped from New Zealand by 17,000 tons and saved 50 tons of CO2 from being released in the atmosphere. A further benefit is the reduced risk of diesel spills around the atoll's reefs. ""There may be other larger solar power installations in the world, but none could be more meaningful to customers than this one,"" said Takao Shiraishi, general manager of the Kansai Electric Power Company that helped implement the scheme. ""The plight of Tuvalu versus the rising tide vividly represents the worst early consequence of climate change. For Tuvalu, after 3,000 years of history, the success of UN climate talks in Copenhagen this December may well be a matter of national survival,"" he said in a press statement. The next scheme is building a solar power system for a secondary school on Vaitupu, one of the outer islands. ""We thank those who are helping Tuvalu reduce its carbon footprint as it will strengthen our voice in upcoming international negotiations. And we look forward to the day when our nation offers an example to all -- powered entirely by natural resources such as the sun and the wind,"" said Kausea Natano, Tuvalu's minister for public utilities and industries.","Tuvalu in Pacific Ocean threaten by rising sea levels from climate change .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A group of African scientists last week called on rich nations to help stem the tide of African talent leaving the continent's universities. Dr. Francess Ayaebene, who runs a clinic in rural Nigeria, wanted to update her knowledge of tropical medicine. In a statement the Network of African Science Academies (NASAC) urged developed nations to establish training programs that would allow African research students to stay in Africa or study in other developing countries. One program that may prove key to curbing the flight of the skilled health professionals from the developing world is the distance learning course at the UK's London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The school, a world leader in global health education and research started the course to allow health professionals to enhance their skills and knowledge at their own pace and in their own country. Dr. Francess Ayaebene, a physician in rural Nigeria, earned a diploma through the distance learning course offered. Dr. Ayaebene directs a clinic in Shendam, a rural area in central Nigeria where nurses and health services are in short supply. She wanted a refresher on tropical medicine and also hopes the additional training will help her gain entry into the world of government. ""I want to improve my country and go into politics to influence policy making when it comes to health matters,"" she told CNN. Some 2,500 students are enrolled in the London school's distance learning program, which offers Master's degrees and graduate diplomas in infectious diseases, public health and clinical trials. ""We don't train people for the brain drain. We train people very much to make a contribution to their own countries,"" said Andrew Haines, the director of the London School. A complex set of factors contribute to brain drain, and while it's too early to say that distance learning has had an impact on the trend, Haines believes it can make a contribution to retaining people in their home countries. ""When I speak to distance learning students, many of them say this has opened up an opportunity that otherwise wouldn't have come to them -- to stay in their own countries and at the same time access teaching materials of an international quality,"" he said. The program offers a flexibility that meets the wide range of needs of learners these days, providing access to specialized training to those who cannot leave their home country due to financial constraints or professional commitments. A sign of the course's popularity: Nearly three times as many students participate in the distance program than actually come to study at the school in London. The program also is getting a boost from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which awarded the London School a $1 million prize for excellence in global health this year. The Gates Award for Global Health, which is awarded annually to an organization that makes exceptional contributions to international health, will be used partly to developing new courses, providing scholarships and offering support for distance learning students. Distance education is by no means novel, but instructors say the London School program is particularly enhanced for students in the developing world and unique in its international audience. Students from around the world participate in the program, with roughly 40 percent of students based in countries in Africa and a good proportion in Southeast Asia, said Sharon Huttly, the dean of studies. While Internet access has improved considerably since the distance learning program began in 1998, many students enrolled in the program still live in areas where bandwidth is poor and connections are slow. ""One of our biggest challenges is trying to deliver something that is still accessible and suitable to a student who is sitting somewhere that's got very poor Internet access but also is suitable for a student sitting somewhere who's got every gadget and high-speed bandwidth available to them,"" Huttly said. At the core of the program are self-study materials which students follow at their own pace. These materials are complemented with electronic mechanisms like Web chat boards that allow students to interact with each other and tutors. Dr. Ayaebene hopes that as well as distance learning programs, governments will encourage more doctors to practice in rural areas to improve public services. ""There are not enough nurses and ambulance services,"" she said about the region where she works. ""The government needs to push more doctors to rural areas. The hospitals -- they will not run themselves.""","Distance learning widens access to world-class health training and education .

"(CNN)  -- Didier Drogba scored twice as Chelsea re-established a five point lead at the top of the English Premier League with a 3-0 win over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Manchester United's 4-1 thumping of Portsmouth had lifted the reigning champions to within two points of the leaders, but Chelsea underlined their title credentials with a dominant display against an Arsenal side whose own ambitions took a severe jolt. Arsenal had plenty of possession in the first half without carving out a clear opportunity, but fell behind to a well-worked goal in the 41st minute. Chelsea captain John Terry found his fellow England international Ashley Cole in space down the left and his crisp cross was met on the volley by Drogba to leave Manuel Almunia with no chance. Just before half time and Arsenal were two down as another excellent Cole cross was accidentally deflected past his own goalkeeper by Belgian international Thomas Vermaelen. Arsenal brought on Theo Walcott after the break and he sparked a brief home rally as they had the ball in the net from Andrei Arsnhavin only for it to be ruled out for an Eduardo foul on Petr Cech. Almunia had to save smartly to keep out a deflection off Frank Lampard, but the third came near the end as Drogba's unstoppable free-kick sealed the three points. It was the Ivorian international's 11th league goal of the season and his 10th in 11 appearances against Arsenal in London derbies. It leaves Chelsea on top with 36 points from 14 games, with Manchester United on 31 and Tottenham in third on 26, one ahead of north-London rivals Arsenals, who have played a game less. In Sunday's other matches, Liverpool beat Everton 2-0 and Birmingham won 1-0 at Wolves in local derbies. A own goal by Joseph Yobo, who deflected home a shot by Javier Mascherano in the 12th minute, and Dirk Kuyt's late strike sealed three points for Liverpool in the Merseyside clash at Goodison Park. The victory was welcome relief for underfire manager Rafael Benitez as his team moved up to fifth in the standings after being eliminated from this season's Champions League in midweek. Lee Bowyer scored a third minute goal for Birmingham to beat Midlands rivals Wolves and move into mid-table.","Didier Drogba scores twice as Chelsea beat Arsenal at Emirates .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama marked the one-year anniversary of his controversial economic stimulus plan Wednesday, declaring the $862 billion package an unequivocal success that has created or saved millions of jobs. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and members of Obama's cabinet also fanned out across the country in a slew of separate events designed to amplify the president's claims. Republican opponents belittled the president's assertion, and characterized the plan as a massive waste-filled Washington special-interest giveaway that expanded the deficit while failing to slow rising unemployment. The radically different claims reflected the high political stakes tied to the public perception of what many observers consider the signature legislative achievement of Obama's first year in office. ""We have rescued this economy from the worst of this crisis,"" Obama said at the White House. ""We acted because failure to do so would have led to catastrophe. We acted because we had a larger responsibility than simply winning the next election. We had a responsibility to do what was right."" The measure ""was never intended to save every job,"" he said. ""Businesses are the true engine of growth [and] always will be. But during a recession ... what government can do is provide a temporary boost."" The program, he said, has ""run cleanly, smoothly and transparently."" Vice President Joe Biden, the administration's point man on implementation of the plan, argued that ""without any question"" the package is working and ""laying the foundation"" for long-term economic growth. ""We know times are [still] tough for too many people,"" he said. But there is ""no reason we're not going to come out of this [downturn] stronger than when we went into it."" The bulk of the money initially allocated for the plan has not actually been spent yet. Through the end of January, roughly $334 billion in spending has been approved, of which $179 billion has actually left federal coffers. Another $119 billion has gone to tax cuts. The federal government now expects to distribute $32 billion in stimulus funds per month, up from an average $27 billion a month over the past year, according to Biden. Now that the economy is no longer in free fall, the mix of spending will change, senior administration officials said. Until this point, the bulk of the spending has been on tax relief and direct aid, such as unemployment benefits. To date, only $31 billion has been spent on projects such as infrastructure, high-speed rail, broadband and health technology. But in the second phase of the act, the amount of money going to these initiatives will more than double to $7 billion a month as work on them ramps up. The administration views this spending as setting the stage for a lasting expansion. ""Many projects are just now getting under way, and will be creating jobs throughout 2010 and beyond,"" Biden said earlier this week. ""Work on many Recovery Act projects will accelerate in the spring and summer months as weather conditions permit work on roads, bridges, water projects, and Superfund site cleanups."" In depth:  The stimulus project . Payments to states and individuals will fall to $11 billion per month, from $14 billion. Much of this spending -- such as Medicaid funding and additional unemployment benefits -- was meant to stabilize the economy during the recession. The administration will reach its goal to disburse 70 percent of the Recovery Act funds, or $551 billion, by September 30, senior administration officials said. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently hiked the cost estimate of the stimulus plan to $862 billion, though the administration still uses the original $787 billion figure. Republicans have torn into what they argue is the stimulus' failure. The Republican National Committee released a video Wednesday claiming that ""the American people are tired of politicians who don't admit when their policies don't work. The president and the Democrat Party can either admit their policies failed and change course now or continue their binge spending agenda and face certain defeat at the polls in November."" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said earlier in the week that taxpayers ""aren't getting their money's worth from the trillion-dollar 'stimulus' and struggling families and small businesses are rightly asking, 'Where are the jobs?'"" House GOP Whip Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said states have lost a total of 2.9 million jobs between the bill's enactment last February through December, though the administration projected stimulus would save or create 3.5 million positions. Obama teased congressional Republicans on Wednesday for slamming the plan ""even as many of them show up for ribbon-cutting ceremonies for projects in their districts"" funded by the act. In the final quarter of last year, the Recovery Act directly funded nearly 600,000 jobs, according to the Web site Recovery.gov. The figure is based on about 160,000 reports from state, local and corporate recipients who have spent $57.9 billion in stimulus money. It does not tally jobs created indirectly through companies buying supplies for stimulus projects, people spending their tax cuts, increased unemployment benefits and the like. In total, the economic stimulus program has boosted employment by 1.5 million to 2 million jobs, the president's chief economic adviser said in mid-January. That figure is derived from a mathematical formula based on how much money has flowed out the federal door. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted last month found a majority of respondents -- 56 percent -- opposed the stimulus plan. Forty-two percent supported it. Fifty-eight percent, however, believed the stimulus had stabilized or improved the economy, while 41 percent said it either had no effect or had made the economy worse. The poll of 1,021 adults was conducted by telephone from January 8-10, and had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

"(CNN) -- Cheryl Morse was 19 years old when she hitchhiked more than 700 miles from Chicago, Illinois, to Bethel, New York. She was determined to make it to the Woodstock music festival. An estimated 400,000 people attended the Woodstock music festival in Bethel, New York, in August 1969. Although Morse, now 59, no longer recalls details such as how long it took to get there or what food, if any, she ate, she still vividly remembers the music. When Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young opened their set with ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,"" she said the energy in the crowd was intoxicating. And she can still picture folk musicians Arlo Guthrie and Joan Baez performing in the rain Friday night. ""It was like being totally shut off from the rest of the world for three days, with nonstop music by world-class musicians playing their hearts out ... for our party,"" she said. Forty years later, the Woodstock Music and Arts Fair remains a major cultural touchstone. Held in Bethel on August 15, 16 and 17, 1969, the music festival welcomed some of the biggest musicians of the era and legions of fans from across the United States. Despite the concert's size -- an estimated 400,000 people attended the festival -- it seems the idea of Woodstock is bigger than the actual event was. It is remembered as a peace- and love-filled celebration, an out-of-this-world experience fueled by rock 'n' roll music and copious drugs.  See Woodstock 40 years ago, and what the site looks like today » . Like many others, it wasn't until Morse left the festival grounds and re-entered the outside world that she began to realize Woodstock's impact. She stopped at a local market on her way out of town and saw news coverage of the festival on television. ""Until [then], I had not thought about the outside world at all,"" Morse said. ""That was when I slowly began to comprehend the impact the gathering was having on the country."" Woodstock, Morse explained, ""came at a pivotal point in history,"" when the Vietnam War and subsequent anti-war movement were in full swing. The festival, a massive event that was largely peaceful and free of riots, was considered exceptional for the time. Years later, Morse realized that Woodstock ""would never be forgotten,"" she said. ""It took you 10 years to realize you were part of history,"" said Lenny Eisenberg, who made the journey to Bethel to see Jimi Hendrix perform. ""At the time, it was just another great show."" Part of the concert's lasting power was fueled by the Oscar-winning documentary ""Woodstock,"" which also led to a blurred perception of the festival, Eisenberg said. ""I have some distorted ideas of what happened,"" he said. Still, Eisenberg recalls Hendrix's performance that famously closed the festival on Monday morning. The aspiring photographer saved one of the three rolls of film he brought with him to document the guitarist's set. The wait was worth it, he said. Eisenberg captured several shots of Hendrix, including one of the guitarist with his middle finger in the air, seconds after he flashed a peace sign to the audience. iReport.com: See Eisenberg's photos . ""It's really hard to pin down a best memory,"" said Thomas Burke, who was 19 years old when he went to Woodstock. ""The whole place was a memory."" Burke still has his Woodstock tickets along with the check his mother wrote for them. His memories from the event are fond, but fuzzy. ""I remember some of the acts, but not the order or where I was when they played,"" he said. He recalls seeing Richie Havens and Jefferson Airplane, and can't forget Hendrix's legendary performance of ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" ""Woodstock marked a big turning point in my life,"" said Burke, who was drafted into the Army soon after returning home from the festival. ""It was a fitting end to the '60s."" ""It was the experience of a lifetime. I've always been proud of the fact that I was there,"" said Ralph Chin. He remembers the rain and mud, nonstop music, free-flowing drugs and conversations with strangers. For Chin, nothing can recapture Woodstock. ""I went to a couple other festivals after Woodstock, but they fell short on the overall feeling,"" he said. iReport.com: 'The experience of a lifetime' ""Woodstock was like a big party with all your friends there, whereas the festivals afterward felt more like you were an independent entity and had no connections to anyone else."" ""I think it was the ultimate spontaneous thing. It just happened,"" said John Laferlita, a photographer who attended Woodstock at 23. Laferlita heard about the festival on the radio and thought, ""Why not?"" He hopped on a bus from Manhattan, New York, on Saturday, with little more than his camera and tickets. Like many others, he slept on the ground that night. ""There hasn't been anything like it,"" added Laferlita. ""Everything else is planned to the minute, but this was spontaneous. That's what made it so special.""","As Woodstock celebrates 40 years, the music festival still looms large .

"(CNN) -- They may live on separate continents, in different countries with differing cultures, but the same message is being echoed by the world's poor, according to a new report by aid agency Oxfam. Farmers in Uganda have little choice but to attempt to cultivate crops on arid land. The report, ""Suffering the Science,"" tells the stories of people who are discovering to their detriment that long-held truths about seasons and rainfall no longer apply. ""I travel a lot and people are always saying to me, 'the seasons have changed,'""Oxfam chief executive Barbara Stocking told CNN. ""I think there's a real sense of uncertainty. People have lost confidence. They have a very close relationship with the Earth, nature and climate and suddenly they're finding that it doesn't work anymore."" People such as Florence Madamu from western Uganda. ""The sun is prolonged until the end of September,"" she told Oxfam. ""And whenever it rains it rains so heavily it destroys all our crops in the fields. You can plant a whole acre or two and come out with nothing."" July is a particularly harsh month in large swathes of Africa. It's the peak hunger season and this year people are expected to be more vulnerable than usual following record high food prices in 2008. Laborers are planting precious seeds in fields of dirt with no guarantee they'll produce a harvest, while the conditions they're working under are becoming more extreme. ""For me the big worry is that many of them don't know why it's happening so they can't actually help themselves prepare for the changes,"" Stocking told CNN. ""We need to work with them to help them become more resilient -- whether it's cyclones and weather-related disasters or whether it's a long-term change. They need to be prepared for very different sorts of seasons now."" And for unfamiliar diseases. Higher temperatures are encouraging the migration of malaria and other vector-borne diseases into new areas where, in some cases, health authorities are ill-equipped to cope. Oxfam found Iha at her daughter's bedside in a hospital in Indonesia. Twelve-year-old Laila was the second of her children to contract dengue fever at their home on the island of Java. ""They said that this is a new type of dengue fever,"" Iha told Oxfam. ""She has already had 30 bags of infusion water. After nine days her condition is still not stable."" It is the stories of people such as Iha who are living with the consequences of climate change that Oxfam hopes will prompt action from leaders of developed nations who are meeting in L'Aquila, Italy this week. ""Ideally what we'd like is the G8 countries to come out very clearly as to what their targets are for carbon emissions reductions by 2020 and the amounts of money needed,"" Stocking said. ""It's unlikely they'll be as precise about that,"" she conceded, adding, ""but we really need some good strong wording in the G8 communiqué about the recognition that for a deal to be done [in Copenhagen], money will be needed for the poorest countries."" Talks in Copenhagen in December are being billed as an unmissable opportunity for developed and developing nations to agree a global plan to combat climate change. Stocking commended a proposal by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to establish a $100 billion annual fund to help developing nations contend with climate change, but said closer to $150 billion was needed. Oxfam points out that's about the same amount the U.S. government spent on bailing out insurance company AIG. While scientists warn that a cut of 40 percent in carbon emissions by 2020 is vital to avoid severe repercussions, developed nations have yet to commit to anything close. ""We need America to come forward much more positively,"" Stocking said. ""It's really got to stand up to the bar clearly if there's going to be any deal."" ""We're really pressing as well for the EU to come out much more clearly about what it will do it as a whole. ""There isn't even a Council of Minister's meeting until October and that's going to be far too late. There needs to be some serious meetings including heads of state very quickly now to get an agreement to put something very direct on the table,"" she said.","Oxfam report tells the stories of people affected by climate change .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If riding on top of a Mexican freight train while bandits lie in wait, or inviting real-life gang members to improvise street battles doesn't sound like the wisest approach to making your first feature film, try telling Cary Fukunaga. ""Sin Nombre"" portrays one boy's struggle to escape Mexico's gang culture set against the backdrop of the trade in illegal immigrants. Because those are exactly the scrapes the 32-year-old writer-director got into during production of his highly-acclaimed debut ""Sin Nombre."" Set in Mexico against the backdrop of the country's ballooning people trafficking problem, Fukunaga's  social-political thriller shows one boy's struggle to escape Mexican gang culture after meeting a Honduran immigrant girl. The half-Japanese half-Swedish director decided that it would be impossible to portray street gang culture or the treacherous immigrant experience without fully immersing himself in both. ""To tell a story of what it's like to travel on top of freight trains, or the camaraderie of living in a gang, are all things I could imagine maybe,"" Fukunaga told CNN. ""But I wouldn't be able to get it right without meeting the people who actually experienced it, and experiencing some of that with them."" After Fukunaga first conceived ""Sin Nombre"" (which translates as ""Without a Name"") in 2005 he embarked on a mammoth research tour in order to fully understand what it is like to be both a desperate immigrant and a street gang member. He spent two weeks with immigrants at a train yard in Tapachula, Mexico, before risking his life illegally riding on the roof of a train traveling across the border state of Chiapas. ""People get shot, trains derail, assaults happen,"" said Fukunaga. ""I had to understand that if I fell off the train and lost a limb, I could just bleed to death out there, there'd be no-one to come pick me up."" The filmmaker, who is an American citizen, was taken aback by the camaraderie among the immigrants in spite of the danger and violence. ""Some of the bits of humor that would happen on the journey really surprised me,"" he told CNN. ""You could laugh minutes after someone had been shot."" It is this 27-hour train ride, during which a there was a bandit attack, that forms the basis of a substantial portion of the action in ""Sin Nombre."" Fukunaga also visited members of the notoriously violent Mara Salvatrucha street gangs in jail in Mexico. ""I spent about two years in two different prisons, and reduced a group of gang members down to a couple guys I could trust,"" he explained. Fukunaga courted them with with gifts in the hope they would aid his research. ""After bringing them grilled chickens and enough India ink and CD components so they could make tattoo guns, they felt like they could trust me enough to hook me up with one of their outside people. Then they knew I wasn't just a cop."" The end result is a starkly realistic portrayal of the Central American gangs that make their living trafficking people to the United States. The film's action includes a dramatic shootout scene featuring real gang members as extras alongside actors. ""All the guns had blanks,"" Fukunaga said. ""I had a gun too, if I had to regulate the situation."" Not that that made the scene entirely unproblematic: ""The guy who plays the leader in that scene is a gang member,"" said Fukunaga. ""Once we shot that scene he was gone. I don't know where he went, and there was no way to track him down to come back in and record audio or anything."" Nevertheless, Fukunaga maintains that the characters he chose to portray are inherently likeable people. ""I liked the gang members and the immigrants I met equally, and had equal respect for them"" Fukunaga said. ""Some of the kids in these gangs, they seem like they're 28-years-old, but they're actually only 19. They just look old because of the things they've experienced."" ""Sin Nombre"" is executive produced by acclaimed Mexican actors Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna. It impressed judges at this year's Sundance Film Festival so much they awarded it directing and cinematography awards. But even after such an ambitious and successful debut, Fukunaga is not ready to let up and his next project couldn't be more different: a musical with Arcade Fire collaborator Owen Pallett. After all, he said, ""If you're just going to do a paint-by-numbers film, then what's the point?""","""Sin Nombre"" opens a window on Mexico's Mara Salvatrucha gangs .

"(CNN) -- Dutch international Ryan Babel has threatened to leave English Premier League side Liverpool unless he is picked to play in more games by his manager Rafa Benitez. The 22-year-old has told British newspaper The Sun he feels his career has stalled since his move to Anfield, and if the situation does not improve soon he will seek a transfer in January's European transfer window. Babel said that he had told Benitez about his feelings but the situation remained unresolved: ""I have tried to talk to the manager but it isn't of any use. I couldn't really do anything with the feedback [he] gave me. How well is Benitez performing in the battle of the managerial mind games? ""We have agreed to look at my situation during the winter. If there's no improvement then, I have to be honest, I [will] want to play somewhere else. I don't play a lot so I can't be happy and I can't cheer out loud. ""Certain emotions are blocked, they are pushed back by all the worries I carry with me. Sometimes I wonder how long I can sustain it but I will fight for my position - what else can I do?"" he added. Babel's demands come as his side prepare for a crucial away match against Hungarian side Debrecen on Tuesday, in the European Champions League. The five-time former European champions need to win their game and hope Group E rivals Lyon are not beaten by Fiorentina to qualify for the final 16, or else face being dumped out of the world's most lucrative club competition . Failure in Europe could increase calls for Benitez to be replaced as Liverpool's current position of seventh in the Premier League has disappointed many fans. Benitez has injury problems to contend with too; Babel, who scored a against Lyon in their last European encounter, Fernando Torres and Albert Riera are all sidelined. However, the under pressure boss remained positive before the game in a pre-match press conference: ""The last time we qualified it was amazing,'' said Benitez. ""We did it in a good way with four goals against Porto, four goals against Marseille and eight against Besiktas. ""It will be difficult, but we have to do our job, win against Debrecen and then look at Lyon's result. Lyon know that qualifying first is an incentive, it will be good for their confidence and they will get some money too. ""Lyon have this incentive and they are a good team. If we can play against Fiorentina with options it will be fantastic.'' Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher also remained upbeat: ""We always believe at this club that we can do special things. We have done it in the past and we know we can do it again,"" he told reporters. ""We have got ourselves into a bit of a hole and hopefully we can get out of it. It has been done before and we know we can do it again,"" he added. Tuesday's European Champions League fixtures: .

"(CNN) -- Here's a hot tip: The University of North Carolina is going to win the NCAA men's basketball tournament. A Georgia Tech professor's computer model suggests UNC will win this year's NCAA men's basketball tournament. At least that's the prediction of Joel Sokol, a Georgia Tech professor whose statistical model correctly selected the Final Four, championship game and winner of last year's tournament. Be glad he's not in your office's betting pool. Finding some kind of rationality in March Madness, which starts in earnest Thursday, has been an American pastime for decades. Tournament brackets are everywhere, and from sports TV to the dinner table, everyone seems to have predictions about which team will claim the top spot, and why. But in recent years, ""bracketology,"" as sorting out the single-elimination basketball tournament is sometimes called, has increasingly become the scientific endeavor its name suggests. It's even something on which university professors and professional statisticians stake their reputations.  Watch Sokol explain his predictions » . There are at least 40 individual people or groups using statistical models to analyze college basketball and rank its teams online, according to Kenneth Massey, whose Web site, masseyratings.com, lets users compare the analyses. Anecdotal evidence suggests more people are getting in the game, perhaps because the raw data used to run the equations -- team records, point margins and the like -- is easily accessible on the Internet. All of these off-shoot predictions supplement the official computer model used by the NCAA, which is called the Rating Percentage Index. But a selection committee of live people still ranks teams and puts them in tournament brackets. At their cores, the computer models all operate like question machines, said Jeff Sagarin, who has been doing computer ratings for USA Today since 1985. Different people come up with different brackets because they're asking different questions. Sagarin's equations ask three questions: ""Who did you play, where did you play and what was the result of each specific game?"" The computer keeps repeating those questions in an ""infinite loop"" until it comes up with a solid answer, he said. Sagarin has arranged the formula as such partly because he thinks home-court advantage is a big deal in college basketball. Other models ask different questions or give the questions different weights. Sokol, of Georgia Tech, for example, cares more about the win-margin than where the game was played. He got into NCAA basketball prognosticating after watching his team, Georgia Tech, lose a nail-biter in 2002 when Tennessee hit a shot at the buzzer from half court. Sports analysts made a big deal of the loss, he said, which seemed statistically dumb to Sokol. As far as he's concerned a close game might as well be a tie -- the toss of a coin could predict the winner. ""That last shot is almost meaningless,"" he said. It took a few years of testing for Sokol to start believing in his computer model, which was the subject of an academic paper in 2004. That year, Georgia Tech made it to the Final Four, which Sokol and colleagues had predicted. ""They really kind of made us believers in our own system,"" he said. Sagarin, who has one of the older and more respected prediction equations in the business, said a year or two of success does not mean a model will continue to foretell the outcome of the tournament correctly. He grew up a sports junkie who was ""too skinny"" to make it big on the court or field. For a time, he used his intimate knowledge of statistics and college basketball to bet on the annual NCAA tournament. Buzzer-beating shots became the bane of his existence, and in 1983, after Houston lost to underdog North Carolina State on a last-second dunk in the tournament final, Sagarin gave up on betting. ""Each year I try to put minor improvements in [the computer model] and test in the off-season, but that all goes out the window when guys hit three-point shots at the buzzer,"" he said. ""There's a lot of luck in life. Life is a series of heads and tails, and human beings try to describe rationale behind them ... when in fact it may be random."" Dan Shanoff, who blogs on sports at danshanoff.com, said gut feeling is more important than statistics, but taking a look at the numbers can never hurt. In the end, he said, it's all chance. ""You think you know everything about college basketball and then all of a sudden your mom is finishing ahead of you [in a tournament pool], which happens every year to me with my mom,"" he said. Shanoff's gut tells him Louisville will win the men's tournament this year. Sokol, of Georgia Tech, puts Louisville in the Final Four with UNC, Pittsburgh and the University of Memphis. He said Michigan State and Oklahoma are ranked too high and due for an upset, statistically speaking. While all of this information could be helpful for people betting on the Big Dance, Sheldon H. Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois, said he doesn't fill out a bracket, despite the fact that he's developed a computer model for the tournament. ""I enjoy the games and I enjoy the tournament, and not filling out a bracket gives me the freedom to do that,"" he said.","People are using computer models to try to pick NCAA basketball winners .
A successful model from Georgia Tech picks UNC to win this year .
As more data is available online, the practice appears to be more popular .

"(CNN)  -- Didier Drogba is backing his Ivory Coast team to make history by becoming the first African country to reach the final of the World Cup next year. Drogba is contemplating a big challenge by the Ivory Coast in South Africa. The Chelsea striker scored the decisive goal as the Elephants sealed their place in South Africa with a 1-1 draw against Malawi on Saturday, but he is now looking ahead to the finals with relish. ""It is going to be a challenge,"" the 31-year-old told reporters. ""To make it to the final will not be easy because there are great teams like Brazil and Germany who have won the World Cup for many years. ""But my teammates and I want to make history and want to change the way the world sees African football. Can an African team win the World Cup next year ? ""I hope that we'll be the team that is going to go to the final and win the competition."" Ivory Coast have joined Ghana as definite qualifiers from Africa, with three other places up for grabs in the final round of matches in November. Drogba is one of several stars in the Ivorian squad with Champions League experience, including Barcelona's Yaya Toure who is anxious to erase memories of their failure to qualify from the group stages in the 2006 finals in Germany. ""At the last World Cup we played really well in Germany, but we were unlucky because we were in a very tough group with Argentina and Holland and so went out in the first round,"" he said. ""But I think with this kind of experience, it will be possible at South Africa 2010 to do much better. Perhaps we can make the quarterfinals and then semifinals, this is something we can achieve.""

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- A Connecticut doctor whose wife and two daughters were killed in a 2007 home invasion took the stand Tuesday to testify against one of the accused killers, recalling horrific details of being beaten and tied up by his alleged captors while fearing for the well-being of his family. William Petit, testifying on the trial's second day in New Haven Superior Court, calmly relayed to an attentive jury the events leading up the invasion. Prosecutors allege that Steven Hayes, 47, and Joshua Komisarjevsky, 30, broke into the Petit family's home in July 2007. The men are said to have beaten up Petit, strangled his 48-year-old wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and set the home ablaze. The couple's two daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, died of smoke inhalation. The two paroled felons are charged with capital murder, kidnapping, sexual assault, burglary and arson. They both could face the death penalty if convicted. Hayes is accused of raping Hawke-Petit, and prosecutors have charged Komisarjevsky, who will be tried separately, with sexually assaulting Petit's 11-year-old daughter. July 22, 2007, began with Petit, his wife and Michaela attending church, Petit testified Tuesday. Hayley was just returning home that day from a weekend visiting with friends. Petit then played golf with his father while the girls went to the beach. The plan, Petit said, was for Michaela to help her mother cook dinner that night. ""Michaela loved to cook,"" said Petit, who was wearing a heart-shaped Petit Family Foundation pin on his lapel. The family finished dinner and the girls settled into the family room to watch ""Army Wives""; Petit fell asleep in the sun room while reading the Sunday paper, he said. The next thing he remembers, he said, was ""thinking or feeling 'ow, ow, ow!'"" as blood ran from a gash on his head. ""I sort of awoke in a daze. ... The next thing I knew I was seated on the middle of the sofa, with my head down (and) there was something warm running down the side of my face,"" he testified. ""I saw two people standing in front of the sofa, one in front and one slightly to the rear ... and the one in the rear holding a gun, down and to his side."" While Petit said he could not clearly see the gun, he could see its form and shape, adding that ""it appeared to resemble a 9 mm semiautomatic gun."" Prosecutor Michael Dearington produced a gun as evidence and Petit confirmed ""that gun is consistent with the shape of the gun I saw."" Petit testified that the suspects told him to lie down on the couch ""and tied my hands at the wrists and my feet at the ankles"" and covered his head with an unidentifiable piece of fabric. ""I heard one of them say, 'If he moves, put two bullets into him,"" he added. Eventually, the suspects led him, with his head still covered, to the basement. ""I heard nothing from Jennifer, Hayley or Michaela. ... I did not know where they were in the house, for the most part,"" he said. Once he was taken to the basement, Petit was bound to a support pole by a rope around his chest and waist, his hands still bound with plastic zip ties. ""I would sort of go in and out of it, and slide down the pole,"" he testified. ""My body weight sliding down made my body feel better. ... Eventually I was able to get the rope on my hands untied, and break the plastic. But I was not able to undo my feet."" Petit recalled that earlier in the ordeal, one of the suspects asked where the family kept their safe. ""I said we had no safe,"" he testified, adding that ""much later on, I heard Jennifer ... say that she would need to get dressed and need her checkbook or my checkbook to go to the bank."" A bank teller at a local Bank of America branch testified Monday that Hawke-Petit asked to withdraw $15,000, telling the woman she needed the money ""because she and her family were being held hostage at her house."" Petit said that for the most part ""it was very quiet"" while he was trapped in the basement, but at one point he heard ""three loud noises, like someone was throwing 20- or 30-pound sacks on the living room floor."" ""I heard moaning and the thumps, and may have yelled out 'hey!'"" he said. ""And a voice yelled, 'Don't worry, it'll be all right in a couple of minutes.' But there was definitely a change of voice . . . more sinister."" Fearing for his family's safety, Petit, still bound by his feet, hopped to the basement door. ""I just thought time was of the essence, and I needed to get help,"" he said, telling how he hopped up the basement stairs and headed to the house of his neighbor, Dave Simcik. ""I started to crawl, but that wasn't very efficient, so I started to roll -- the whole time I was yelling 'Dave, Dave!' ... I rolled over, with my feet still tied, banging on his garage door, hoping he would hear. The garage door went up, and Dave said 'Can I help you, sir?', and I said 'Dave, it's me, Bill, call 911!'"" Petit said police arrived moments after he made it to the Simcik house. He said officers asked him who was in his house, and he replied, ""the girls, the girls."" Petit said he recalled hearing a ""whoosh"" sound shortly after one of the men in the house yelled to him ""don't worry, it will all be over soon,"" though he said he did not smell smoke or see flames once he was out of the house. After the ambulance arrived, he was taken to a hospital. In all, Petit said, he lost between five and seven pints of blood. Prosecutors say the suspects put gasoline in several plastic gallon-size jugs found at the house -- originally filled with windshield washer fluid -- to start the fire in the home. The only other witness Tuesday was police Sgt. Phillip Giampietro, who testified that he was working at ""an extra job"" on the morning of the home invasion when he received word ""that there was a possible home invasion/hostage situation."" Giampietro described seeing ""activity in the driveway at one point,"" and then the Petit's vehicle ""quickly backed down the driveway."" The Chrysler Pacifica escaped after hitting an unmarked police car and running over a stone wall. Giampietro identified the passenger in the vehicle as Hayes. The sergeant said the Pacifica took off ""at a high rate of speed"" and that ""shortly after it disappeared, I heard a crash."" Giampietro said he and other officers tried to enter the home at that point, but were unable to do so because of the intense smoke, heat and fire. ""There was so much fire and so much heat the [window] panes were disintegrating and falling onto the ground,"" he said. In an odd twist Tuesday afternoon, a male juror was dismissed after telling the courtroom that he's ""confused by the presentation of the state's case, and what seems to be a lack of preparation on their part."" Prosecutors filed a motion for his dismissal and Judge Jon C. Blue granted the motion to objections from the defense. In issuing his ruling, Blue said that the juror ""is in such a state of agitation that I'm worried about the contamination of the jury. ... This is an extraordinary occurrence.""","NEW: Police sergeant says he saw Hayes fleeing the scene .

"(CNN) -- Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko expects to play for AC Milan next season. The Bosnian international, whose 26 goals last season inspired the Wolves to the Bundesliga title, has already informed his club he intends to move to the San Siro outfit. ""I recently spoke to Wolfsburg executives about it and they know that I would like a transfer next summer,"" Dzeko told Gazzetta dello Sport. ""The story with AC Milan is not over."" Dzeko was strongly linked with the Rossoneri last summer but despite AC Milan holding talks with the Bundesliga side, Wolfsburg refused to sell their top player.

"SALT LAKE CITY, Utah (CNN) -- Carolyn Dennis, mother of a 5-year-old, initially wasn't too keen on Utah's decision to move her to a four-day workweek. Mylitta Barrett says Utah's four-day workweek makes looking after her disabled son, Joseph, harder. Dennis and 17,000 other state employees this month began working four 10-hour days per week rather than five eight-hour days. When told of the change, Dennis immediately thought about her son. She normally picked him up from day care in the afternoon. Since she'd now be working later, pickup seemed like it'd be a problem. ""My first instinct was, 'Day care closes at 6 p.m.,' "" said Dennis, who works at the state Department of Commerce. But then something else hit her: She's just picked up an extra day off per week. If she could work out the day-care issue, the change wouldn't be so bad after all. ""I am going to have every Friday to spend with my son,"" she said.  Watch Utah's big experiment with the four-day workweek » . Utah is betting benefits like that -- and the millions of dollars it hopes to save on energy bills by closing some state buildings on Fridays -- will outweigh the adjustments that workers and service seekers will have to make. In a one-year experiment, the state moved most of its employees -- those working in non-emergency services -- to the four-day week August 4. By closing 1,000 state buildings an extra day per week, it hopes to save about $3 million in utility costs during the trial. It also hopes employees will save on fuel costs by driving to work one less day per week. The state, which will decide next year whether to make the move permanent, expects some backlash because the public will have one fewer day weekly to get in-person services such as driver's license renewals. But officials say that because employees will be working longer Monday through Thursday, service hours on those days are extended accordingly. Also, the state says Internet offerings allow people to make some transactions with the state anytime they want. As for Dennis' day-care dilemma, she was in luck. Because many of the parents leaving their children at her son's center were state employees, the center expanded its hours to accommodate them. iReport: Are you overworked? She is charged more per day because her son is there longer. But because she no longer has to pay for Friday care, she's paying about the same per week. Her new day off, Dennis said, will let her slow down and enjoy time with her son. ""As soon as he knew this was happening, we sat down with the calendar and planned out what activities he was going to do for the next three months,"" she said. ""This Friday, we are going to the planetarium; next Friday is the zoo. Those are things I [didn't] get to do with him."" But some workers aren't able to make the switch as easily as others. At the Department of Commerce last week, administrators wheeled around energy drinks and sodas for employees who were bleary-eyed from waking an hour earlier than usual.  See other areas trying four-day workweeks nationwide » . Jeff Herring, the executive director of Utah's Department of Human Resources, said the state is working with employees on the transition. ""The governor has made it very clear that as long as we can serve the public, we need to do what we can to exercise flexibility with the employees,"" Herring said. Utah officials say previous studies on four-day workweeks show that for most participants, having a three-day weekend more than compensates for the longer work hours and recharges employees' batteries. But Mylitta Barrett of Ogden doubts her new day off will provide much relief. A statistician working for the state, Barrett is a single mom of three, including 14-year-old Joseph, who has cerebral palsy and needs constant care. Barrett's carefully orchestrated routine of caring for her sons -- the others are 13 and 9 -- has been thrown off by her new schedule. ""Right now, I can't tell you how it's going to work,"" said Barrett, 48. Because Barrett now leaves for her Salt Lake City job while her children are still asleep -- her new start time is 7 a.m., two hours earlier than before -- she hired someone to help get her sons to school. Barrett said her supervisors have been flexible with her schedule while she tries to adjust. But while her colleagues are ecstatic about having Fridays off, she feels anything but excitement. ""It's great for the people who are getting three-day weekends, and I am real excited for them ... but it's happening at our expense, and that's not fair,"" she said. Barrett said she doesn't foresee switching jobs. She loves what she does and would be unlikely to get elsewhere the medical benefits she needs to care for Joseph. Having a Friday off is nice, she said, but it won't give her back what she's losing. ""You can't make up the soccer game that I missed on Monday because you were working and didn't get home until 7 o'clock at night or sitting down to do homework with the boys. You can't make that up."" CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Utah this month moved most employees to a four-day workweek .

"(CNN) -- Despite international calls for calm and negotiations, Albania's ruling government continued Saturday to levy sharply-worded rhetoric against its opposition and arrested 113 people following a massive Friday protest that turned violent, state-run media reported. Those arrested were charged with confronting riot police and destroying property during Friday's demonstration in Tirana, a city police spokeswoman told reporters, according to the state-run ATA news agency. Three protesters were killed -- all shot at close range, according to Tirana Military Hospital emergency chief Sami Koceku. The clashes left at least 35 civilians and 27 police hurt, the state-run TVSH network reported. ""Yesterday was a terrible day for Albania,"" U.S. Ambassador Alexander Arvizu said Saturday. ""There were no winners. There were only losers."" The opposition Socialist Party claimed, on its website, that around 250,000 people had gathered outside Prime Minister Sali Berisha's office to implore him to resign. Some protesters threw stones and Molotov cocktails at the more than 1,000 police at the scene, who used water cannon to disperse the crowd. The Socialist Party blamed police for provoking protesters by using the water tanks and tear gas. But on Saturday, Berisha again accused his rival Edi Rama, Tirana's mayor and the Socialist Party head, of spearheading the violence. He claimed that demonstrators were trying to takeover the prime minister's office, parliament and cabinet ministries. ""Those behind the putsch and bandits will receive the deserved punishment,"" he told reporters, according to ATA. ""No force in this world can take over the democratic institutions of Albania, a NATO member country."" Earlier this month, in an interview quoted in a Socialist Party newsletter, Rama reiterated long-standing claims that Berisha's ruling Democratic Party had rigged the June 2009 election. ""Are there any Albanians who have not yet understood that (Berisha) stole the elections in order to rob Albania?"" he said. The country's supreme court determined that the elections were valid, and the ballots were burned by the Central Election Commission. The Socialist Party boycotted Albania's parliament between September 2009 and February 2010, according to the U.S. State Department. Reconciliation efforts since then have been unsuccessful, with opposition parties continuing to push hard against the Democrats in alleging corruption. The tensions escalated in the past two weeks, after a former government minister sent the media a secret recording that allegedly documented an illicit back-room deal. In addition to the increasingly pointed, accusatory barbs between Rama and Berisha, personal slurs marred a parliamentary session this week meant to settle governmental changes following the resignation of a minister central to that video. On Friday, Berisha vowed that there would ""be no early elections"" and that ""general elections will be held in 2013,"" a rebuttal to a proposal being pushed by the opposition . Such entrenched stances, the strong language and Friday's violence came as diplomats outside Albania continued to push for a peaceful solution to a southern European nation's stalemate. Rama, then the nation's president, was the focus of the last such severe unrest in 1997, when angry mobs protested voting irregularities and government-backed Ponzi schemes that plunged Albania into near anarchy. Albania's current president, Bamir Topi, met Saturday with prominent U.S., U.K. and European diplomats. A day earlier, he'd urged all parties to resume talks soon and not to reopen old wounds. ""We have repeatedly urged Albania's political leaders to search for compromise,"" said Arvizu, one of those who met with Topi. ""When one side -- or both -- insists on maximalist positions that it knows the other side cannot accept, I'm sorry, that's not compromise. Resolving political differences through street battles is also not compromise, and does not reflect the democratic aspirations of Albanians."" ""It's time to desist from further provocations,"" he added. ""It's time to stop the mutual recriminations and name-calling."" Those remarks echoed similar ones the previous day from the European Union, which has been considering adding Albania as a member. On Saturday, a key member of the EU's parliament said the recent escalation of tensions could hinder that development. ""I hope that, in this critical moment, the politicians will show maturity and will engage ... in finding a compromise solution,"" said Eduard Kukan of Slovakia. Journalist Altin Raxhimi contributed to this report.","Police arrest 113 people after Friday's violent demonstration in Tirana, a spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro is rejoining Juventus after three years at Real Madrid, the Serie A club announced on their Web site on Tuesday. Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro won two Primera Liga titles during his three-year stay at Real Madrid. News of Cannavaro's return comes less than 24 hours after the Turin-based club sacked coach Claudio Ranieri and replaced him with former player and youth coach Ciro Ferrara. The 35-year-old Cannavaro was voted world player of the year after leading Italy to World Cup glory in 2006 and has helped Real to achieve two title triumphs during his stay in Spain. Cannavaro was in Italy on Monday for a charity match and told the Juventus Web site: ""I am happy to have returned to Turin and to have the opportunity to wear the black and white jersey again. ""I am sorry that for a section of the fans the anger for having been transferred is greater then the appreciation for the glorious seasons which we lived together. ""I am sure that I can convince the most sceptical through my work, professionalism and the passion with which I will face this new adventure"". Defender Cannavaro won two scudetti with Juventus, in 2005 and 2006, while the side are currently fighting to clinch third place behind champions Inter and their city rivals AC Milan. His one-year contract will come into force as from the start of July and club official Alessio Secco enthused: ""Fabio is a world champion, a golden ball winner and a great team-spirit builder. ""During the Summer of 2006 the club was forced to sell him due to great economic necessities. ""This year we took advantage of the natural expiration of Cannavaro's contract to bring him back to Turin and we are sure that his technical abilities will help Juventus become more competitive"". Cannavaro left Juventus after the club had been relegated to Serie B following the match-fixing allegations that rocked Italian football. He was born in Naples and played for them for three seasons before joining Parma where he won the UEFA Cup and two Italian Cups over a seven year period from 1995. Cannavaro, who has 124 caps for Italy, left Parma to join Inter Milan in 2002 but after only two seasons moved on to Juventus. New coach Ferrara is determined to take Juve straight into next season's Champions League group stage and said on Monday: ""I think the players need to understand that we're in a tight spot. ""They need to rediscover the right motivation to tackle our last two matches with the right attitude. The players need to rediscover their pride and the right motivation.""","Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro rejoining Juve after three years at Real Madrid .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Carl Azuz and this is CNN Student News! We're back from the long weekend and ready to kick off 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines. We start in the U.S. state of Arizona. First Up: Arizona Shooting . AZUZ: U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords could be released from a hospital there in just days or weeks. Congresswoman Giffords was one of the victims of the shooting attack in Tucson, Arizona earlier this month. On Sunday, doctors upgraded her condition from critical to serious, so that's a step in the right direction. Hundreds of people took to the streets on Sunday to participate in a ""Walk for Peace."" Organizers said they wanted to honor the victims of the shooting and find a way to help bring the community together. Some congressional leaders from both parties are trying to come together in their own way, starting with something small: sitting together at the State of the Union address. This is the speech that the president gives to Congress every year. And what you see in these pictures is last year's State of the Union address. You notice that one section is standing, while another is sitting? That's because Republicans and Democrats usually don't sit together during these speeches. This year, though, you might see a different seating arrangement. Junior Theater Festival . AZUZ: This weekend, here in Atlanta, a cast of thousands got together for the Junior Theater Festival. The event celebrates the performing arts. It takes place the same weekend as Martin Luther King Day. In recognition of his dream, students at the festival had the chance to talk about their dreams. Listen to what they had to say. KATE HILSCHER, STUDENT: I have a dream that some day kids will have a bigger voice in their communities. I feel like kids have a lot to say, but it's often not heard by the adults around them. QWANIKWIA HICKLEN, STUDENT: My dream is to become an endangered species specialist and help save a kind that's dying off slowly. ELIZABETH RENEGAR, STUDENT: A few of my dreams are to adopt a child from a foreign country and give them a home, a lot better home than they could've had. CASEY TAYLOR, STUDENT: One of my dreams is to possibly design and run lighting for large theatrical productions. Martin Luther King Jr. was a great man and inspired me and many other people for wonderful dreams. AZUZ: Not the only way that people paid tribute to the civil rights leader this weekend. As Samantha Hayes reported yesterday, Americans all across the country took part in community service projects and honored Dr. King's legacy. (BEGIN VIDEO) SAMANTHA HAYES, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: At a Washington, D.C. middle school, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama worked with a mentoring program on a service project, a Martin Luther King Day tradition for the first family. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Michelle and I and the girls are extraordinarily proud that each year on Martin Luther King's birthday, this is how we celebrate, is making sure that we're giving a little something back to the community. HAYES: It's been nearly 43 years since the civil rights leader was assassinated at a hotel in Memphis before a protest march. In Atlanta, not far from King's childhood home, family members laid flowers at the gravesite where King and his wife Coretta Scott King are buried. Today marks the 25th anniversary of the Martin Luther King holiday. In 1994, Congress designated it a national day of service. Jesse Jackson, who was with King at the time of his death, says his dream has not been fully realized. REV. JESSE JACKSON, RAINBOWPUSH COALITION: He would be delighted to know we've come to a higher level of socialization enough to vote for each other across lines of race, gender and religion. And so, President Barack Obama is in Washington today as head of state. He would find delight in that. But then on the other hand, the issue of violence, the shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, it simply illuminates, we pray to God for her recovery, but it illuminates just how much more violent we've become. HAYES: Back in the nation's capital, a memorial honoring Dr. Martin Luther King is scheduled for completion later this year. For CNN Student News, I'm Samantha Hayes. (END VIDEO) I.D. Me . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a country located in northern Africa between Algeria and Libya. I got my independence from France in the 1950s. My capital city is Tunis. I'm Tunisia, and I'm home to around 10.5 million people. Protests in Tunisia . AZUZ: Tunisia is forming a new government that'll be responsible for leading the country to new elections. All of this is coming after weeks of riots and protests. People are upset about bad living conditions, high unemployment and accusations of government corruption. There's been fighting between protesters and police. And the Tunisian president -- who'd been president for 23 years -- was forced out of power. Why does this matter to America? Well, for one, the U.S. and Tunisia are close allies, especially when it comes to fighting terrorists. Another concern: Before all of this started, Tunisia was considered a pretty safe and stable country. Some experts argue that what's happening in Tunisia could inspire similar protests in other countries. What's the Word? JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the Word? a type of financial aid that students earn through academic achievement . SCHOLARSHIP . That's the word! Funding Free Tuition . AZUZ: Well, here in Georgia, we have something called the HOPE Scholarship. It's for students who do well in high school and go to college in state. But the scholarship is facing some potential challenges. Kyra Phillips heads to Athens and my alma mater -- the University of Georgia -- to look at how HOPE has helped, and why the scholarship could be in trouble. (BEGIN VIDEO) DANYELLE REYNOLDS, UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA JUNIOR: Go Dawgs! KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN ANCHOR: University of Georgia junior Danyelle Reynolds beams with school pride. She is a Georgia Bulldog through and through. She's also a HOPE scholarship recipient, and that means she doesn't pay a dime toward tuition. REYNOLDS: Initially, I was actually looking at going out of state. But once I saw the numbers of out-of-state at some schools and then paying in-state and not having to pay for that tuition, so just paying for housing and books and some of the fees, it was really a no-brainer. PHILLIPS: A no-brainer to more than a million Georgia students who have taken advantage of the scholarship since it was introduced in 1993. Here's how it works: Earn a 3.0 grade point average in an in-state high school and maintain your grades at college. Amounts vary, but some students can get up to $6,000 a year for tuition, fees and books at any eligible Georgia university or technical school. It's funded by the state lottery, but demand is high and more money is going out than coming in. Lawmakers are dipping into reserves, scrambling to cover costs. And Georgia's new Republican governor says something needs to change. GOV. NATHAN DEAL, (R) GEORGIA: I am dedicated to honoring the promise that has been made to our students through HOPE and will work with the general assembly to tailor the program to the financial realities that we face today. PHILLIPS: Other legislatures in other parts of the country are watching for Georgia's next move. More than a dozen other states modeled their own scholarship programs on HOPE. Many of them are now caught in the same kind of budget crunch. NANCY MCDUFF, ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT, UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA ADMISSIONS & ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT: I don't know that any other program is identical to what we have in Georgia, nor has it been around as long and had a chance to grow. So, they're watching us carefully, and we're hoping that we'll be able to to preserve this so that students and families will be as impacted as least as possible given the current economic situation. PHILLIPS: Spend a day in this college town, and you'll be hard pressed to find a Georgia student who hasn't benefited from HOPE. Freshman Lindsey Harris says the opportunity has been a life-changer. LINDSEY HARRIS, COLLEGE FRESHMAN: It's pretty much the only way I was going to be able to go to college. PHILLIPS: And unfortunately, her family isn't banking on the scholarship for the younger siblings. AMY HARRIS, LINDSEY HARRIS'S MOTHER: I've got a 10-year-old also and 5-year-old. I'm not really counting on HOPE being there in eight years or 13 years for them. (END VIDEO) Promo . AZUZ:  Want to expand your geographic genius? You know you do.

"(CNN) -- A double from Klass-Jan Huntelaar saw AC Milan warm up for next week's Champions League clash with Manchester United by defeating Udinese 3-2 at the San Siro, a result that moves them up to second place in the Serie A table. The home side took a seventh minute lead when Dutch international Huntelaar powered home a near post header from Ronaldinho's superb cross. And in-form Ronaldinho, who has been surprisingly left out of Brazil's squad for next month's friendly international against the Republic of Ireland, also set up Alexandre Pato to tap in a second goal six minutes before half time. However, the visitors pulled a goal back on the stroke of half time when Antonio  Floro Flores headed home Antonio Di Natale's cross. But man-of-the-match Ronaldinho helped restore Milan's two-goal advantage in the 57th minute when his free-kick was flicked on by Massimo Ambrosini, for Huntelaar to score from close range. Di Natale made the last four minutes interesting when firing past goalkeeper Dida, after beating the Milan offside trap, but the home side held on to go above Roma in the table -- eight points behind city rivals Inter. Meanwhile, in the Friday evening German Bundesliga match, Borussia Moenchengladbach beat Nuremberg 2-1 to move up to 11th place in the table.","Klass-Jan Huntelaar scored twice as AC Milan beat Udinese 3-2 on Friday .

AZUZ: Well, the leaders of the world's two largest economies get together in Washington, D.C. We're talking about President Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao. The Chinese leader is in the U.S. for a visit. The two presidents are scheduled to sit down today to talk about some of the issues that are important to both nations. President Hu landed in Washington yesterday. In addition to President Obama, the Chinese leader is scheduled to sit down with leaders in Congress and business executives. The issue of trade is likely to come up at all of those meetings. The U.S. and Chinese economies are connected in a lot of ways, and each country has had some complaints about the other one's policies. Jill Dougherty has more for us on the connections between the U.S. and China and the current status of the relationship between these two world powers. (BEGIN VIDEO) JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Two nations oceans apart, locked in a complex relationship that will help chart the 21st century. HILLARY CLINTON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Today, our relationship has gone global. We debate and discuss nearly every major international issue. DOUGHERTY: Friends or rivals? A former deputy secretary of state says for the U.S., China is both. RICHARD ARMITAGE, FORMER DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE: They are a factor of life as the second largest economy in the world, by every measure, whether it's political, social, economic, and for that matter security. And furthermore, they have very key interests of their own in areas that are extraordinarily important to us. DOUGHERTY: Spin the globe and you see China's growing competition with the U.S. for access and influence. From Africa, where China craves oil and other resources, to Latin America, in search of commodities and alternatives to its heavy investment in the U.S. For many Americans, China, for years, has meant bargains. But increasingly, China means jobs for Americans at home. U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY TIMOTHY GEITHNER: Our exports to China are growing at twice the rate of growth of our exports to the rest of the world. These exports support hundreds of thousands of jobs across the nation in all sectors. U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES: We welcome a China that plays a constructive role on the world stage. DOUGHERTY: Yet China's burgeoning military power is stoking concern in Asia and the U.S. GATES: But questions about its intentions and opaque military modernization program have been a source of concern to its neighbors. DOUGHERTY: Washington says with power comes responsibility. For now, China looks outward, mostly to benefit itself . ARMITAGE: China's outreach, I believe, in the main is based on what they perceive is their economic and political interest. However, it is the case that this compels them on occasion to deal with what we consider pariah regimes. DOUGHERTY: The U.S. really needs China's help in pressing Iran and North Korea on their nuclear programs. But on every world issue, from terrorism to climate change to piracy on the high seas, Washington also looks to Beijing. CLINTON: Embracing the obligations that come with being a 21st century power will help to realize a future that will give the Chinese people even more, in fact, unimagined opportunities. But that means accepting a share of the burden of solving common problems, . DOUGHERTY: And that, Clinton argues, includes respecting human rights, releasing political prisoners and protecting ethnic minorities in Tibet. (END VIDEO) Health Care Repeal? AZUZ: Moving on to our next story today. The U.S. House of Representatives, there's a vote scheduled today to repeal, or overturn, the controversial health care reform law. During last year's midterm election campaigns, a lot of Republicans said they'd try to overturn the law if they were elected. They won a majority in the House, so this vote is a way for them to keep that promise. Most people though -- including most Republicans -- don't expect the health care law to be completely overturned. That's because an outright repeal has to be passed by the House and the Senate, and Democrats have a majority in the U.S. Senate. Shoutout .

AZUZ: ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier is back in Haiti this week. He showed up in the Caribbean nation on Sunday. Yesterday, he was taken into custody while authorities decided whether or not to officially arrest him. Human rights groups say that while Duvalier was in power, thousands of Haitians were killed or tortured. He was also accused of taking money from the country's treasury. No one's really sure why ""Baby Doc"" -- he's the person waving -- returned to Haiti. One of his associates said it was connected to the anniversary of last year's earthquake. Duvalier was given control of the country by his father, who was known as ""Papa Doc."" That's how the younger Duvalier got the nickname ""Baby Doc."" Shoutout Extra Credit . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for a Shoutout Extra Credit! Which of these countries is part of the Horn of Africa? You know what to do! Is it: A) Somalia, B) Liberia, C) Tunisia or D) Namibia?

AZUZ: The area around the Horn of Africa, specifically, the waters off the coast of Somalia, is home to more pirate attacks than anywhere else in the world. That's according to a new report that found 2010 was the worst year ever for piracy worldwide. Zain Verjee looks at some of the ways companies and governments can protect themselves from pirates. (BEGIN VIDEO) ZAIN VERJEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The hope is this can ward off pirates. It may seem laughable, but mannequins posing as guards in the dead of night could fool pirates and force them to flee. There are other tactics, as one NATO commander tells me. LARRY TRIM, NATO COMMANDER: Barbed wire, perhaps, around their ship. They have extra lookouts posted to look for Somali pirates. They have a routine where they can find fire flares, water hoses, etc. VERJEE: Warships try to stop pirates before they hit major shipping lanes like the Gulf of Aden. The captain would have seen a skiff out there and then ordered out the Marines to go and deal with the pirates. TRIM: We take away their equipment. We take away their mother ships, which is damaging to them, and then send them back to shore. VERJEE: In Mombasa, Kenya, the Greek commander of this warship supports operations around Somalia for the European Naval Force, EU NAVFOR. He tells me what's tough. CAPTAIN VASILEIOS EFSTATHIOU, EU NAVAL FORCE SOMALIA: The area is really huge. The area of operation is equal about the size of the United States. VERJEE: Just compare the size here. A powerful warship like this one, completely outfitted with weapons and technology, is chasing around boats smaller than the size of this one out on the Indian Ocean. Deep in a building in central London, one private, maritime security firm has got a bird's-eye view. They're watching feeds, tracking vessels and weather patterns. RAURI DOWDS, MARITIME UNDERWATER SECURITY CONSULTANCY: We analyze them to try and create a picture of what's real and what's not. VERJEE: They help steer ships in real time, sometimes to rougher waters where small pirate skiffs can't operate. DOWDS: We always consider factors such as rainfall and most importantly the wind. VERJEE: Everyone I speak to tells me there's only one real solution for Somalia. That's not on the sea, but on the shore, where only a government that works can control its people. For now, as Somali pirates plan attacks, real men, and, oh, let's call them reinforcements, patrol the high seas hoping ships pass safely. (END VIDEO) Before We Go .

"(CNN) -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Samuel Eto'o were both kept under wraps by their former team-mates as Inter Milan held Champions League holders Barcelona to a dour Group F goalless draw at the San Siro. Thierry Henry (left) finds no way past Javier Zanetti as Inter Milan and Barcelona cancel each other out. The quick return of the two strikers to their old clubs dominated talk in the build-up to the match but neither player, or anyone else for that matter, was able to find the breakthrough as defences came out on top. The visitors had the better of the chances, with Lionel Messi skipping inside two defenders forcing goalkeeper Julio Cesar into a fine save in the opening minute. Seven minutes later Ibrahimovic had a decent chance to net against his former employers when he got in behind the Inter defence, but his subsequent shot was poor. Messi had another effort soon after, his header being comfortably saved by Cesar, before Inter had their first sight of goal when Maicon fired over from 20 yards out. Barca were back in the ascendancy towards the end of the half, and Seydou Keita missed the best chance of the period four minutes before the break. Xavi's chip found Dani Alves inside the area, and he drew out Cesar before laying the ball back to Keita with most of the goal to aim for. However, the Mali international fired wide of the far post to let Inter off the hook. Barca survived a sare in the 65th minute when Dejan Stankovic fired just over from outside the box, before Messi, put the ball over the bar from six yards out for Barca after latching onto Thierry Henry's driven cross-shot. Barca then had a loud penalty appeal turned down, believing Stankovic had handled in the area, but those claims fell on deaf ears and the Catalan giants were forced to settle for a draw. Meanwhile, in the other group match, Dynamo Kiev scored three goals in the final 20 minutes as they came from behind to beat Russian debutants Rubin Kazan 3-1. The visitors took a shock 25th-minute lead when Alejandro Dominguez lashed a free-kick into the top left-hand corner of the net. Kiev had to wait until the 70th minute to equalize when Ayiila Yussuf rose to head home Junior Gerson Magrao's corner. Nine minutes later, Kiev went ahead when Andrei Shevchenko's pass found Magrao to fire home -- and Kiev made the three points safe with five minutes remaining when Oleg Gusev lashed home a right-footed shot. In Group E, both Liverpool and Lyon won their opening home matches 1-0 against Hungarian side Debrecen and Fiorentina of Italy respectively. At Anfield, Dirk Kuyt's 12th goal in 35 Champions League games gave the Premier League side a hard-fought victory. The Dutchman is now Liverpool's third-highest scorer in the competition's history after he forced the ball home after goalkeeper Vukasin Poleksic had palmed out a Fernando Torres drive. In Lyon, the home side made a winning start to their campaign with a narrrow win over a 10-man Fiorentina side who had striker Alberto Gilardino sent off at the end of the first-half for elbowing Jeremy Toulalan. Miralem Pjanic scored the winner from close range in the 76th minute after Fiorentina goalkeeper Sebastien Frey had kept out Kim Kallstrom's cross.","Inter Milan and holders Barcelona draw 0-0 at San Siro in opening Group F tie .

"(CNN)  -- Nikolay Davydenko produced a ruthless display to beat U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro in straight sets to win the ATP World Tour Finals in London on Sunday. Davydenko had dispatched world number one Roger Federer in the semifinals and re-produced the magic to see off the Argentine 6-3 6-4 in one hour and 23 minutes at the O2 Arena. The victory in the elite, eight-man end-of-season showpiece is the highlight of the 28-year-old Russian's career, going one better than 2008 when he lost in the final to Novak Djokovic of Serbia. Davydenko, seeded sixth, had begun the week with a thrilling three-set loss to Djokovic in round-robin play, but proceeded to rack up four straight victories, culminating in his emphatic win over fifth-ranked Del Potro. It earned him $1.5 million and he was delighted to have captured the first major trophy of a career marked by consistency but mostly in a support role to the game's very elite. ""For me it was amazing coming here number seven and winning the tournament. I surprised myself,"" he said. Del Potro looked weary after his epic three-set semifinal win over Swede Robin Soderling the previous night. He dropped his service in the fourth ganme of the opening set and could claim only five points on his opponent's service as the Russian eased to an early lead. The second set was tighter, with Del Potro having a break point in the sixth game. But at 4-4 Davydenko made his move on Del Potro's service. Two blistering passing shots set up three break points and he claimed a 5-4 lead after a long rally. Serving for the title, he set up match point with an ace and took it when Del Potro could not return a fiece smash. It capped a week of surprises at the new venue with world number two Rafael Nadal crashing out with three straight sets defeats and home hope Andy Murray edged out of the round-robin by Federer and Del Potro by the slimmest of margins. Soderling, who only came into the tournament as a late reserve for the injured Andy Roddick, and Davydenko were the surprise qualifiers from the other group, with the latter going all the way after beating the Australian, French, U.S. Open and Wimbledon champions. Del Potro acknowledged he had been beaten by the better man on the day. ""Congratulations. You are a great champion,"" he said. Now Davydenko will eye his first grand slam title at the Australian Open in January, which will be the next major tournament test for the leading players. Earlier, In the doubles final, American pair Bob and Mike Bryan beat Max Mirnyi and Andy Ram 7-6 6-3 to win their third ATP Finals title and claim the number one ranking in the world at the end of the season for the fifth time.","Nikolay Davydenko wins ATP World Tour Finals title in London .

"(CNN) -- The Wiggles have been officially wiggling for 17 years now, entertaining children with music, television, videos and films that have become modern classics. The Wiggles have been entertaining children with colorful, clean-cut songs since 1991. In Australia, their annual end of year national tour sells over 120,000 tickets, while their U.S. fans include John Travolta, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, John Fogarty, Shaquille O'Neal, Chris Rock, Courtney Cox-Arquette and Cate Blanchett. And since 2003, in addition to their native English, they also wiggle in Mandarin and Spanish, reaching out to the Taiwanese and Latin American public, respectively. Anthony Field, Murray Cook and Greg Page met at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, where they were studying early childhood education and writing children's songs. Together with fellow musician Jeff Fatt, who played with Anthony in the popular 1980s band The Cockroaches, they formed The Wiggles and released a self-titled album on ABC Music in 1991. Fifteen years and 27 DVD releases later, they had been awarded with 17 Gold, 12 Platinum, 3 Double Platinum and 10 Multi Platinum Awards for sales of over 17 million DVDs and 4 million CDs worldwide. They have also been awarded with Highest Selling Children's Video Sales in 1995, 1996, 1998 and 1999 at the ADSDA Awards. The Wiggles made their U.S. debut at the famous Wall Mart in June 1999, while performing in shopping mall parking lots. In 2003 they performed 12 sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City and performed to over 250,000 people in November 2005. That year also initiated a series of amusement-park openings, from Wiggles World at Dream World on the Gold Coast of Australia, to a second Wiggly Play Centre to be launched in Dallas, Texas, USA.","Anthony Field, Murray Cook and Greg Page studied early childhood education .

"London (CNN) -- A British businessman who is accused of having his wife killed during their honeymoon in South Africa was given two more weeks to prepare his defense against extradition, a judge ruled Thursday. Shrien Dewani's next hearing will be February 8, the judge ruled. He is free on bail until that date, when the timing of the extradition hearing will be set. Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of hitmen to kill his wife during a taxi ride in Cape Town, South Africa in November. Dewani's wife, Anni Dewani, died in an apparent carjacking as the couple took a taxi ride in a crime-ridden neighborhood of Cape Town. Dewani was allowed to leave South Africa, but prosecutors there later accused him of hiring the hitmen to kill Anni. Dewani's lawyers say he is innocent and will fight extradition. Granting him bail in December, British Judge Duncan Ousely rejected concerns from the South African government that Dewani would use his funds and international connections to flee before an extradition hearing. Ben Watson, a lawyer for the South African government, cited hotel surveillance video that he said showed Dewani twice meeting with a cab driver as the sort of evidence indicating Dewani's involvement in a plot against his wife. But Ousely ruled that Dewani, who did not attend the hearing, had a genuine interest in clearing his name and said he has cooperated with investigators from both England and South Africa. Dewani's solicitor, Andrew Katzen, said he was ""delighted"" with the outcome but declined further comment following the court hearing. In documents, prosecutors detail meetings that Dewani had with the taxicab driver during which he allegedly paid the driver 15,000 South African rand ($2,170) to have hitmen kill his wife and make it look like a carjacking. ""The alleged hijacking was in fact not a hijacking, but part of a plan of subterfuge which Shrien Dewani, the husband of the deceased and the accused, had designed to conceal the true facts ... that the deceased was murdered at the instance of the husband,"" South African prosecutors wrote in court documents. The court documents do not say why Dewani allegedly wanted his wife dead. The driver, Zola Tongo, was sentenced to 18 years in prison in South Africa after admitting to taking part in the killing. CNN's Antonia Mortensen and Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report.","Shrien Dewani is accused of staging a carjacking to have his wife killed .

"Beijing (CNN) -- The Chinese economy continued its breakneck growth in 2010, expanding by 10.3%, according to government figures released Thursday. Last year China's economic output eclipsed Japan to become the world's second largest economy with just over $6 trillion, completing a decade long gallop that saw it jump the economies of France, the UK and Germany. China's growth in 2009 was 9.2%. The U.S. is the world's largest economy with an estimated $14.6 trillion GDP for 2010. Interactive: The world's 10 largest economies . The yearend figures come out as Chinese President Hu Jintao makes a high-profile visit to the U.S., being feted at a state dinner by U.S. President Barack Obama -- the first such dinner for China in more than 13 years. The summit has also highlighted a range of issues between the world's two largest economies, such as the global economic crisis, international security, the environment and human rights. Obama administration officials used the president's meeting with Hu to highlight economic progress between the two countries, announcing Beijing's approval of $45 billion in new contracts for U.S. companies to export goods to China. The contracts will support an estimated 235,000 American jobs, according to the White House. The Chinese economy grew 9.8% in the last quarter of 2010, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. Consumer prices grew 3.3% year-on-year, ahead of China's 3% target. But more troubling for Beijing is the price of food rose 7.2%. As the economy expands, inflation is a growing concern for China's economic minders, said Professor Patrick Chovanec at Tsinghua University in Beijing. China has implemented price controls on food ""but whether that deal with the underlying inflationary pressure is an entirely different problem,"" Chovanec said. ""Nothing China has done so far has really tackled that."" Two chief U.S. economic concerns are China's currency, which critics say is widely undervalued, and increased access to U.S. businesses in the burgeoning China market. Obama dismissed a reporter's question about U.S. fear of China's rising power, saying that China's explosive economic growth is good for the world and, more specifically, American businesses. We want to sell China ""all kinds of stuff,"" he said. ""We welcome China's rise,"" Obama said. Washington just wants to ensure it ""reinforces international norms and international rules, and enhances security and peace as opposed to ... being a source of conflict."" While the meeting dealt with a range of topics, U.S. officials continued to focus intensely on the fact that the government-controlled People's Bank of China is artificially undervaluing the yuan, bringing down the cost of Chinese exports, which would give it an advantage in the international market. CNN's Helena Hong, Pauline Chiou and Kevin Voigt contributed to this report.","The Chinese economy grew 10.3% in 2010, according to government figures .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Government airstrikes killed 20 Taliban militants in the past 24 hours in northwest Pakistan, a military source said Monday. Residents sift through the rubble of a bombed out school near Peshawar city. The airstrikes were launched in the village of Charmang, as part of an attempt to retake small pockets of Bajaur Agency, according to the source. CNN could not confirm the casualties because of access and safety reasons. The operation is going on in north and south Waziristan, the source added, particularly to clear supply routes and prepare for a major operation against Pakistan's Taliban chief, Baitullah Mehsud, who has ties to al Qaeda. The Pakistani military has been conducting an offensive against the Taliban, centered in the Swat region of North West Frontier Province. Also Monday, a police officer and two civilians were killed when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into a police checkpoint near Peshawar. And on early Sunday morning, a bomb blast destroyed a girl's school east of Peshawar city, authorities said.

"(CNN)  -- Inter Milan took a stranglehold on the Serie A title with a 3-0 win over Cagliari on Sunday which saw them open a 10-point lead over city rivals AC Mlan, who could only manage a goalless draw at Bologna. Roma's later 1-0 win at Fiorentina, with Mirko Vucinic scoring the only goal, saw them move into second place above Milan, eight points adrift of Inter but having played a game more. Milan's draw continue their disappointing form which began with a defeat in the derby match against reigning champions Inter two weeks ago. Since then they have drawn their next two matches, with Inter taking full advantage, although they are facing a renewed challenge from Roma, who have gone 12 games without defeat. Goals from Goran Pandev, Walter Samuel and Diego Milito earned Jose Mourinho's Inter side a comfortable victory in the San Siro, taking the lead after just six minutes. Samuel Eto'o, playing his first game since returning from Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon, set up Pandev to score at the near post. The second came after 20 minutes as central defender Samuel headed home a Maicon corner. Cagliari had a goal chalked off for offside which TV replays showed should have stood and Julio Cesar pulled off a brilliant save to deny fellow Brazilian Nene. There hopes of a revival were ended in the early stages of the second half as a neet move involving Eto'o and the excellent Pandev saw Milito score the third. Milan had the better chances at Bologna and Ronaldinho hit the crossbar with a spectacular effort in the second half.  Late on, captain Mansion Ambrosia also saw an effort rebound off the woodwork. In other action, Antonio Di Natale scored a hat-trick for Udinese in a 3-1 home win win over Champions League aspirants Napoli. At the other end of the table, rock-bottom Siena lost 2-1 to Sampdoria, who are also chasing a European place, while troubled Lazio slipped into the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at home to Catania. In the German Bundesliga,  Eintracht Frankfurt jumped to seventh with a fine 3-2 away win over Borussia Dortmund. Benjamin Kohler gave visitors Frankfurt the lead in the eighth minute before Mats Hummels equalized nine minutes later. Lucas Barrios made it 2-1 for Dortmund in the 57th minute, but goals from Sebastian Jung and Alexander Meier saw Frankfurt to three valuable points. Mainz kept their unbeaten home run intact as Bo Svensson's goal near half time saw them beat Borussia Monchengladbach. In Sunday's action in Spain's La Liga, nine-man Sevilla crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Real Zaragoza to slip out of the top four. Sevilla striker Alvaro Negredo scored an own goal to give Zaragoza a winning lead and was then sent off for violent conduct. Real Mallorca leapfrog them into fourth as they scored a 10th home victory in a row to beat Villarreal 1-0.","Inter Milan go eight points clear in Serie A with a 3-0 home win in the San Siro over Cagliari .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor has been handed a three-match suspension for his stamp on Arsenal's Robin Van Persie last weekend. Adebayor has also been charged for his goal celebration in last Saturday's defeat of Arsenal. The Togo captain decided not to challenge the charge of violent conduct, so received a fast-track punishment from the English Football Association, which means he will miss this weekend's Manchester derby. The 25-year-old still faces another charge, of improper conduct, relating to City's 4-2 Premier League victory against his former club on Saturday. Adebayor -- Hero or villain? Adebayor raced the length of the field at City's Eastlands stadium to celebrate in front of the visiting Arsenal supporters after scoring the third goal, and was pelted with items including a plastic seat. The hearing for the second charge has yet to be set by the FA.  Blog: Adebayor deserves to be banned . The ruling body said in a statement on Thursday: ""A regulatory commission today considered the charge of violent conduct issued against Manchester City's Emmanuel Adebayor under the fast-track disciplinary procedure following an incident with Robin van Persie during their fixture against Arsenal on September 12. ""Taking into consideration Mr Adebayor's acceptance of the charge of violent conduct, the regulatory commission have ordered that he serve a three-match suspension from all football, commencing September 17. ""A separate charge of improper conduct will be considered at a later date."" City have until September 30 to indicate whether the club and player will contest the second charge. As well as missing Sunday's eagerly-awaited trip to Old Trafford to face Premier League champions United, Adebayor will also sit out next Wednesday's League Cup tie at home to Fulham and the visit by West Ham to Eastlands on September 28. Adebayor has been a key figure since his $41 million summer switch from Arsenal, scoring in each of the club's first four Premier League games -- two of them being the only goal of the match -- to help the team to a 100 percent record. However, his ugly attack on the grounded Van Persie left his former teammate with facial injuries, and his ill-advised goal celebrations have only further alienated from Arsenal fans -- many of whom were happy that he left after the player publicly courted Barcelona and AC Milan last season. City manager Mark Hughes faces a striker crisis this weekend, with only Craig Bellamy of his front-line forwards likely to be available. Robinho, Roque Santa Cruz and Benjani have already been consigned to the injured list and Carlos Tevez is rated extremely doubtful to face his old club.","Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor handed three-match ban by FA .

"(CNN) -- New Sunderland owner Ellis Short insists that he will not interfere on the football side following his takeover of the English Premier League club. Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn, left, and new owner Ellis Short at the club's final game of the season. The American billionaire will buy out the controlling interest of the Drumaville Consortium headed by club chairman Niall Quinn, upping his stake from 30% to 100%. Based in Texas, he has made the North-East club the fourth in the Premier League to have American owners, alongside Aston Villa, Manchester United and Liverpool. His move came hot on the heels of news on Wednesday that Portsmouth owner Alexandre Gaydamak had agreed to sell his club to United Arab Emirates businessman Dr Sulaiman Al Fahim -- who was previously instrumental in the Abu Dhabi United Group's takeover of Manchester City. Short, who saw Sunderland avoid relegation on the final day of the season last weekend, told the club's Web site that he will be sticking to the financial side of the business and allowing former Black Cats striker Quinn to deal with football operations. ""Niall runs the club,"" the 48-year-old said. ""Niall is a very smart footballer, very smart about the Premier League and is a wonderful chairman of the club who knows more about football than I ever will, so I will be in the background and Niall will be running the show.

"Rio De Janeiro (CNN) -- As floodwaters receded in some parts of the state of Rio de Janeiro, the devastation from flooding in Brazil continued to climb Wednesday, and the death toll nationwide reached at least 765. Much of the damage occurred in that state, where heavy rains have liquefied hills into tombs of mud and debris. The state's death toll from flooding has climbed to 741, according to government figures released Wednesday. And thousands are homeless across the state. In Teresopolis, where 302 bodies have been found, one official predicted that the final tally may far exceed that. ""I think there may be five times what we found until now,"" said Maj. Carlos Falconi, who coordinates the rescue operation in what was once a picturesque tourist town and is now a wasteland. In Nova Friburgo -- the hardest-hit city, according to government figures -- 355 deaths due to flooding have been counted. In Petropolis, 63 deaths; and in Sumidouro, 21. Rescuers have not been able to reach some hard-hit areas, and the damage is not over -- forecasters predict rain for the next several days in areas already submerged. Other states in the South American country have also seen heavy rainfall. Last week, authorities in neighboring Sao Paulo state said 24 people had been killed by flooding. Brazilian authorities have been criticized for a lack of disaster planning and for allowing homes to be built on property known to become treacherous in the rainy season. They are under pressure to show a strong response. Brazil is scheduled to host the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016.

"(CNN) -- Genoa prevented city rivals Sampdoria from moving into Serie A's top three after triumphing 3-0 in a fiery derby on Saturday that saw three players sent off. The home side moved up to fifth place, just a point behind the Blucerchiati. Omar Milanetto put Genoa ahead from the penalty spot in the 10th minute Reto Ziegler was ruled to have fouled Rodrigo Palacio, then the Sampdoria player managed to hit his own post trying to clear Giuseppe Sculli's low cross. Giuseppe Biava had a header tipped onto the crossbar by Samp goalkeeper Luca Castellazzi, but he was then sent off just before halftime after receiving a second yellow card for deliberate handball. Marco Rossi doubled the lead in the 53rd minute, passing the ball through Castellazzi's legs after evading the hapless Ziegler, who gave away his second penalty of the night in the 75th minute for a foul on Sokratis Papastathopoulos. Raffaele Palladino made it 3-0 from the spot, while the visitors ended the game with nine men when Fabrizio Cacciatore was red-carded with two minutes left as tempers flared. In Saturday's other game, top scorer Antonio Di Natale returned from suspension to inspire Udinese to a 2-0 win at home to struggling Livorno. He curled in a 29th-minute freekick before Antonio Floro Flores made it 2-0 with a header from Aleksander Lukovic's cross 10 minutes later, lifting Udinese up to 12th and leaving Livorno in the bottom three. Meanwhile, third-placed AC Milan will be without right-back Massimo Oddo for the rest of this year due to a thigh injury suffered in the Champions League clash with Marseille. The 33-year-old was replaced by Ignazio Abate 28 minutes into the 1-1 draw at the San Siro last Wednesday, which left Milan two points behind group leaders Real Madrid ahead of the final match away to Swiss side Zurich on December 8.","Genoa prevent city rivals Sampdoria from moving into Serie A's top three .

"(CNN) -- Michael Owen scored his first goal for Manchester United, and fellow-striker Wayne Rooney his 100th, as the English Premier League champions returned to winning form with a thumping 5-0 victory at Wigan on Saturday. Michael Owen celebrates his first Manchester United goal as the English champions thumped Wigan 5-0. Meanwhile, Arsenal top the table on goal difference after making it 10 goals from just two matches with a 4-1 home win over bottom-of-the-table Portsmouth. But all eyes were on United, after their stunning 1-0 midweek defeat at newly-promoted Burnley, and Alex Ferguson's side endured a frustrating first 45 minutes against determined opponents. However, Rooney finally made the breakthrough in the 56th minute with a fine header from former Wigan winger Antonio Valencia's cross . From then on, United were always in control. They doubled their lead two minutes later when Dimitar Berbatov cheekily chipped the ball over goalkeeper Chris Kirkland before finding the net with his second touch. Rooney added his second, and United's third in the 65th minute with a shot that deflected off defender Mario Melchiot. The England striker then made way for compatriot Owen, who broke his United duck with five minutes remaining with a cool finish after being set-up by Nani. Portuguese Nani had the final word with a superb free-kick in stoppage time  that sailed over a stranded Kirkland's head. Arsenal followed up last weekend's 6-1 win at Everton by thumping Portsmouth, who have now lost all three of their matches, at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners took an 18th-minute lead when Abou Diaby smashed home Eduardo's cut-back  and the French midfielder added a second when he slotted home a Cesc Fabregas pass. Portsmouth pulled a goal back before half-time when Younes Kaboul took advantage of hesitancy by goalkeeper Manuel Almunia to head home a Madir Belhadj cross. The home side restored their two-goal lead in the 51st minute when William Gallas, who scored a fortunate goal against Celtic in midweek, was again lucky to deflect a Thomas Vermaelen volley over the line. Substitute Aaron Ramsey beat the offside trap to make it 4-1 on 69 minutes when he latched onto Robin van Persie's slide-rule pass. Former Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor scored for the second successive weekend to help big-spending Manchester City make it two wins out of two with a narrow 1-0 victory at home to newly-promoted Wolves. The Togo striker crashed home a Carlos Tevez pass to secure the points for Mark Hughes' side. Kenwyne Jones scored twice as Sunderland recovered from going a goal behind to beat Blackburn 2-1 at the Stadium of Light. French defender Gael Givet gave Blackburn the lead when he thumped home a left-footed shot through a crowded penalty area. But Jones levelled when he rounded goalkeeper Paul Robinson and slotted home into an empty net and the Trinidad striker nodded home the winner in the 54th-minute from Lee Cattermole's cross. Kamel Ghilas scored his first goal for the club to give Hull their opening win of the season, 1-0 at home to Bolton, while Birmingham and Stoke shared a 0-0 draw in the day's other match.","Michael Owen scores first goal for Manchester United in 5-0 victory at Wigan .

"(CNN) -- World number three Kim Clijsters eased past Russia's Dinara Safina with a 6-0 6-0 victory in the first round of the Australian Open on Tuesday. Safina, a finalist at this event in 2009 and a former world number one, lasted only 44 minutes against Belgium's Clijsters and lost without winning a game for the first time in her career. ""I didn't know how to win a point, embarrassing,"" the 23-year-old, now ranked 75th, told the WTA Tour's website. ""I was looking forward to this match. We've played many times.

Second seed Vera Zvonareva also scored a straight-sets win with a 6-2 6-1 success over Austria's Sybille Bammer at the Rod Laver Arena.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A common perception among many who have followed the recent banking and stock market crises is that the big financial players have been reckless, splashing large amounts of other people's money on half-understood, risky schemes. Go on, take a risk -- it might be good for the economy. But a pioneering business school study -- which, perhaps uniquely in it's field, gathered data inside a Las Vegas casino -- now suggests precisely opposite. Indeed, in many parts of the economy the problem could be that people are simply being too cautious, the authors surmise. The paper, which has the catchy title, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: Evidence from Blackjack Tables,"" was produced by Bruce Carlin and David T Robinson, both finance professors at UCLA's Anderson school and Duke University's Fuqua school respectively. They studied more than 4,300 hands of blackjack played for real at a Las Vegas casino -- more than $120,000 changed hands -- and uncovered what psychologists call an omission bias; that is, players being more conservative in their bets than the level which would have optimized winnings. Mostly, such studies of risk are carried out in laboratory conditions where, both figuratively and literally, the stakes are lower. ""As we point out in the paper, blackjack is a great venue to study how people behave during risky situations,"" Carlin told CNN. ""What is striking is that they often play too conservatively, even though they have voluntarily accepted a role in a risky game."" Blackjack was the ideal pursuit to use as a testing ground as it is widely acknowledged that players are at the tables to maximize gain. Equally important, with bets being made before decisions are made, the strategy pursued is not shaped by a shifting level of exposure to potential loss or gain. The study's key finding was that passive strategy errors, in which players fail to take the right action, were four times more common than mistakes in which they did something that was not necessary. Crucially, ""passive mistakes"" -- players failing to take the necessary action -- were on average one third more financially costly than mistakes caused by overconfidence. The paper also found evidence for what was termed a ""rebound effect"" -- that an error made by playing aggressively was more likely than average to be followed in the next round by a passive error. The authors were at pains to rule out other factors that could affect the outcomes, such as card counting strategies, or players simply getting confused. On the latter point, the authors found that more complex hands were no more likely to prompt errors of omission. Inexperience was also eliminated -- in fact, small-stakes gamblers, perceived as more likely to be newcomers, made fewer errors of caution than those betting higher. But can any wider lessons really be drawn? As the paper notes: ""Perhaps few decisions of economic consequence are made at a blackjack table."" Nonetheless, it argues, the same risk-versus-inaction decision is present in many areas of business and economics. ""We can extrapolate our findings to investment decisions, insurance choices, and savings choices in the general public,"" Carlin said. ""Many of these people are not seeking risk and probably exhibit what we find in a more profound way.""","Business school study examined blackjack players at Las Vegas casino .
Finding was that losses came more from over-caution than recklessness .

"Editor's note: CNN executive producer Suzanne Simons is the author of ""Master of War: Blackwater's Erik Prince and the Global Business of War."" Private contractor Xe flies military personnel in Afghanistan and helps train Afghan border police. The company formerly known as Blackwater, now called Xe much to its chagrin, has been at the center of the contractor debate for years. From the time four of its men were ambushed and murdered in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004, to a shooting involving a team of its men in a Baghdad neighborhood in which at least 14 Iraqi civilians were killed in 2007, the company has drawn unwanted headlines. Blackwater owner Erik Prince downsized the company earlier this year when business failed to keep pace with investment. He changed the company's name after the Iraqi government banned it from doing business there. But those who thought contractors were going away under President Obama's administration couldn't be more wrong. According to the Department of Defense, there are some 68,000 contractors in Afghanistan today and more than 132,000 in Iraq. But those numbers aren't an accurate reflection of the total number of contractors because they don't include those working for other government agencies such as the Department of State. Many of those tens of thousands are third-country nationals, meaning they were hired from a third country to go to Iraq. Many earn between $400 and $700 a month; while Americans, particularly those performing dangerous security duties, can earn as much in a day. Despite being kicked out of Iraq, Xe still does a healthy business in Afghanistan, flying military personnel from one location to another and helping train Afghan border police charged with making the country's massive, porous borders more secure. It's one of the many jobs that the U.S. military just isn't staffed to tackle on its own. In fact, the U.S. military today is beefed up by a force of nearly a quarter million private contractors. There are even cases where contractors oversee the contractors. And that's the problem. The U.S. has come to rely on them so heavily, in such a short period of time, that the government has come under fire for not managing them adequately. Even among the eight-member team that makes up the Wartime Contracting Commission, a congressionally mandated effort to review the contracting process in Iraq and Afghanistan, the question of whether the United States needs the contractors isn't even an issue. The issue, rather, is how well the government is managing this massive support force called up in the immediate aftermath of the war in Iraq. In its interim report released this month, the Commission found that ""neither the military nor the federal civilian acquisition workforces have expanded to keep pace with recent years' enormous growth in the number and value of contingency contracts."" The report also said, ""the government still lacks clear standards and policy on inherently governmental functions. The decision has immediate salience given the decisions to use contractors in armed-security and life-support tasks for military units."" One of the biggest nightmares for legislators is that the force that has grown into such a critical modern-day military support structure was for a long time operating in a legal gray zone with no clear avenue of justice should something unsavory occur. That has led to some tough work for both prosecutors and the FBI, as they take on the task of investigating allegations of wrongdoing by contractors overseas. Doug Brooks, head of the IPOA, an industry-friendly voluntary organization made up of 62 companies, spends much of his time doing outreach and making sure member companies measure up to the internal standards. ""We have the power to kick people out of the association,"" Brooks said, but that's about where it ends. They can't prosecute anyone.  But to say that there has been no progress on the legal front wouldn't be fair. Legislation has been passed that essentially holds contractors accountable for their actions under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, but with everything in this business, there was a hang-up with that, too.  The legislation was written to cover contractors working in support of the Department of Defense, but there are even more contractors working in support of the State Department and other U.S. agencies. The Special Inspector General for Iraq, Stuart W. Bowen Jr. produced a report in February titled Hard Lessons: The Iraq Reconstruction Experience. He then testified before Congress that ""the United States government was unprepared and ill-equipped to mount a major contingency relief and reconstruction program in Iraq in 2003. For the last six years we have been on a steep learning curve."" He also told members of Congress that the United States relies too heavily on the hired help, testifying that ""outsourcing management to contractors should be limited because it complicates lines of authority in contingency reconstruction operations."" Something that retired Lt. Gen. Richard Sanchez would undoubtedly agree with.   Sanchez, who led the U.S. military operation in the early days of the Iraq war, has launched an information campaign aimed at bringing more accountability to the debate. He's even called for a truth commission to investigate policies regarding the interrogation of detainees.   Guess what. Contractors were involved in that scandal, too. As for Blackwater, scandal, or the suspicion of it, played a significant role in its downturn. Plagued by lawsuits and federal investigations, the company now called Xe is a shell of what Blackwater was five years ago. Most of Prince's top executives are gone, budgets have been dramatically curtailed and the company has largely returned to its roots, as a training facility for law enforcement and special forces.   Is Blackwater's fate a sign that things are sour in the industry? Hardly. As IPOA's Brooks puts it, they're here to stay, its about time we made it work. ""I think the other conclusion that companies have come to is that we're going to be working with the private sector. Nobody wants soldiers to go back to flipping eggs, guarding gates, that kind of thing.""","Blackwater, now Xe, has garnered unwanted attention over the past few years .
Though kicked out of Iraq, Xe does a great deal of business in Afghanistan .
Bottom line: U.S. relies heavily on private military contractors .
The issue is how well U.S. government manages this support force ."
"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The new Bundesliga season kicked off on Friday when defending champions Wolfsburg beat Stuttgart 2-0 at the Volkswagen Arena -- Fanzone details what to expect from the new campaign: . So what's new? No less than eight teams underwent a change of coach during the off season with Bayern Munich's appointment of Louis van Gaal the most high profile after the disappointing reign of Jurgen Klinsmann and Jupp Heynckes' spell as caretaker boss. Felix Magath has left champions Wolfsburg to help revive ailing Schalke, who finished eighth last time round, with former Stuttgart chief Armin Veh moving into the hot seat. Brazil playmaker Diego was the most significant player departure from the Bundesliga after he swapped Werder Bremen for Italian giants Juventus in a deal worth $35 million. Werder filled the void left by the influential midfielder with the $12 million signing of promising youngster Marko Marin from Borussia Monchengladbach. Striker Mario Gomez moved to Bayern Munich from Stuttgart for a Bundesliga record fee of $43 million while Wolfsburg increased their goal options with the capture of Nigeria forward Obafemi Martins. One change in the structure of the Bundesliga is the reduction of the winter break from six to three weeks to help ease fixture congestion and enable the national team longer to prepare for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. . Lukas Podolski is back at his former club Cologne . Key players: Speculation over the future of Bayern Munich star Franck Ribery - who has been linked with Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United - has been the main transfer topic that has filled column inches during the off season. If Ribery remains with the club he could prove to the difference between Bayern and the rest of the title contenders although the arrival of defensive midfielder Anatoliy Tymoschuk from Zenit St Petersburg will add some much-needed steel to their midfield. Brazil striker Grafite notched 28 goals in 25 Bundesliga matches last season and his form in the 2009/10 season could be key if Wolfsburg can hold onto their title. The battle for places in Joachim Low's squad for the 2010 World Cup could also have a knock-on effect on the fortunes of several Bundesliga sides. Who will win the Bundesliga title? Sound Off below. Bayer Leverkusen pair Stefan Kiessling and Patrick Helmes could well be vying for one place in Low's squad, while Lukas Podolski in particular will be keen to be make up for lost time with Cologne following his emotional return to the club after a stop-start spell at Bayern. Wolfsburg won their first Bundesliga title last season . Key clubs: Hoffenheim enjoyed a creditable first Bundesliga campaign and were top heading into the winter break before they faded in the second half of the season following a serious injury to leading striker Vedad Ibisevic. If the Bosnia international can rediscover his touch, and new signings Franco Zuculini and Maicosuel settle in quickly, then Ralf Rangnick's men could again upset the established elite and this time stay in contention until the end of the season. Schalke supporters will hope that new boss Magath can repeat the heroics he achieved with Wolfsburg last time round. The 56-year-old steered the Wolves to their first Bundesliga title by improbably pipping Bayern Munich to the post, ending the season top of the division with a two point lead over the German giants at the top of the division after 34 games. Elsewhere, if Podolski can show the form he is capable of and finds the net regularly he may add the firepower Cologne need to move from perennial relegation strugglers to European hopefuls. All eyes will be on new Bayern Munich coach Louis van Gaal when the new season starts. Expert view:  CNN's Kate Giles - ""Well as much as I hate to say it, Bayern Munich are the favorites to do the business this season. By their high standards, last season was a flop. ""After similar disappointment in 2007, they came back hard in 2008 and were little short of unstoppable. I would not expect anything different this time round. ""To add to an already star-studded squad, they have made top-class signings in Gomez, Tymoschuk and Ivica Olic. What's more, they will be masterfully led by new coach van Gaal - who has the credentials and experience lacked by Klinsmann. ""Nonetheless, the past few years have proved the Bundesliga title is not necessarily a foregone conclusion, and there are a few other sides that can challenge the favorites.  Watch the predictions of CNN's Kate Giles for the coming campaign » . ""Wolfsburg will be hoping for a repeat of last season's glory. And after managing to hold on to strike duo Grafite and Dzeko, they are bound to get enough goals to present a solid challenge although the distraction of the Champions League could be their undoing. ""Stuttgart will also be looking to pick up where they left off and cannot afford a slow start this time round. Consistency will be the key if they are to turn into title challengers, although the departure of Gomez to Bayern will leave a huge void. ""Bayer Leverkusen are worth keeping an eye on and have added the experience of Sami Hyypia to their talented young squad while veteran coach Heynckes could be the man to unlock their potential. ""At the wrong end of the table, Nuremberg will hope to improve on the unwanted Bundesliga record of being relegated seven times while fellow new boys Mainz and Freiburg must add to their squads to have any realistic hope of survival.""","Bundesliga champions Wolfsburg kick off the new season against Stuttgart .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's military killed at least 55 militants over the past 24 hours as part of its week-long crackdown on Taliban militants, an army spokesman said Friday. Pakistani security personnel patrol the troubled Buner district. This week's military operation resulted in more than 230 militant casualties since Sunday, while the military suffered two deaths and eight injuries, according to spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas. He has said he hopes the operation will be completed by the end of the week. The operation is part of the Pakistani army's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions. The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan, which have rankled relations between the two countries. Meanwhile, Afghan and coalition forces in southern Afghanistan killed 15 militants and wounded 12 others, the U.S. military reported. The incident, which took place early Friday morning in the Arghandab District of Zabul province, occurred after a military convoy was attacked. ""The patrol was en route to a local village to talk with elders about security issues in the area when they were attacked by several armed militants with small-arms fire from a compound. The combined force returned fire killing one militant,"" the military said in a statement. As Afghan security forces secured and searched that and other compounds to make sure there ""were no non-combatants in danger,"" militants shot at troops and the soldiers fired backed.

"(CNN) -- Italian title hopefuls Juventus suffered another setback with a 3-1 defeat at Bari on Saturday night, coming on the heels of the Turin giants' European exit. Cirro Ferrara's third-placed team remained five points behind Serie A leaders Inter Milan, who travel to lowly Atalanta on Sunday. Bari, meanwhile, moved up into fifth place on goal difference above a group of five teams including Fiorentina. Napoli are also in that bunch on 24 points -- 11 behind Inter -- after drawing 3-3 at Cagliari, who are one point further back in 11th place. Juventus were bundled out of the Champions League after a 4-1 thrashing at home to German side Bayern Munich on Tuesday which meant the Bianconeri failed to get past the group stage of Europe's premier club competition. They will be able to concentrate on domestic glory now, but will need to bounce back quickly to avert a continued slump, having ended last week so well with a 2-1 win against Inter. Bari took the lead in just the seventh minute as former Juve youth player Riccardo Meggiorini blocked a clearance on the edge of the area and then his shot deflected into the net off Nicola Legrottaglie. French forward David Trezeguet equalized in the 23rd minute after Bari goalkeeper Jean-Francois Gillet could only block Diego's shot, but the hosts went ahead again just before halftime with a penalty from Paulo Barreto, who was tripped by Italy defender Fabio Cannavaro. Midfielder Sergio Almiron sealed his former club's fate with a long-range effort that eluded goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon in the 86th minute to give Bari their first win over Juve since 1990. Napoli needed a last-gasp equalizer from Mariano Bogliacino which came five minutes into time added on to deny Cagliari in Sardinia. Ezequiel Lavezzi and Michele Pazienza had the visitors 2-0 up after 65 minutes, but Cagliari hit back with three goals in the final 15 minutes through Joaquin Larrivey, Alessandro Matri -- his seventh in successive games -- and Brazilian striker Jeda.

"(CNN) -- Veteran Spanish full-back Michel Salgado has joined English Premier League side Blackburn Rovers on a two-year deal. Salgado won two Champions League and four Primera Liga titles during his 10 years at Real Madrid. Salgado, who has been capped 53 times by his country, had his Real Madrid contract cancelled by mutual consent earlier this month. During his time at the Bernabeu, the 33-year-old helped the club to two Champions League triumphs and four Primera Liga titles. Blackburn are now waiting for international clearance before Salgado can make his debut. He is heading back to Madrid next week to say goodbye at a match arranged in his honor against Rosenborg on Monday. Salgado said he is relishing the challenge that lies ahead after revealing he almost moved to England five years ago. Talking to the official Blackburn Web site, Salgado said: ""I had a chance to come to Chelsea but I was lucky too because my team was Real Madrid. ""I love the club, I was there 10 years -- it is a lifetime. I am proud of playing for them for so long. ""Now I want to enjoy the next two years, playing in the Premier League. It is one of the best in the world, with fantastic games and a fantastic atmosphere,"" he added. ""This will be a good experience for me, my wife and children. I have joined an historic club.""","Spanish defender Michel Salgado joins English Premier League Blackburn .

"(CNN)  -- Esra'a al Shafei, a recent university graduate in Bahrain, is young, Muslim and frustrated. Young Muslims, pictured here in Afghanistan, are increasingly using technology to engage the world. The 23-year-old says the complexity of who she is as a Muslim is being distorted by extremists and the media coverage of them. Channeling her frustration, she started Mideastyouth.com, a Web site she describes as a place for young people in the region to ""show a different side of our religion"" and discuss topics big and small, taboo and not. She represents a generation of Muslims who are using technology to express themselves, connect with others, challenge traditional power structures and create an identity in an era when Islamic extremists often grab the headlines. ""I think the word that clearly defines the younger generation and also separates them from their parents is 'globalized,'"" said Reza Aslan, the author of two books on Islam, including the recently published ""How to Win a Cosmic War: God, Globalization and the End of the War on Terror."" Access to technology lags in countries with large Muslim populations compared with Europe and the United States. Access also varies between those countries depending on a variety of factors such as governmental control and economic development. But the numbers of people using the Web and cell phones are growing -- and quickly. ""The percentage increases of Internet users in places like Iran, Pakistan and Egypt are astronomical during the past five years,"" Aslan said. A recent study by Forrester Research predicted growth rates for Web usage would continue to soar in the region during the next five years. A battle over interpretation . Al Shafei, who spoke to CNN by phone from Bahrain, said her Islamic identity was partly shaped by a childhood that included Christian classmates and American and British teachers. She also grew up in a country that was relatively progressive enough to appoint a female Jewish ambassador recently. ""Islam is much more relaxed here,"" she said. ""But it doesn't mean we're not good Muslims."" She discovered blogs, and the more she read, the more she grew frustrated with the nature of the dialogue. ""No one was talking to each other,"" she said. The conflict between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006 was the turning point for her. ""I was really annoyed by how the Western and Arab media were covering it,"" she said. ""Both sides were sticking to the extremes."" She said she started her Web site that year to provide the world -- and media -- a different perspective on Islam. ""We're not as simplistic as the media would often make of us,"" she said. Al Shafei said the Web site's discussion subjects range from the political to the taboo, including homosexuality, premarital sex and atheism. The anonymity provided by the Web helps foster such discussion, she said. She is, however, careful to avoid talking about some topics, which could get her in trouble. ""I always remind myself that I have my limitations,"" she said. ""There are various issues that I am unable to tackle for security reasons."" Al Shafei said she hopes that Web sites such as hers could help fight extremist Islamic groups by defeating their arguments through cultural and religious dialogue. But she concedes there's catching up to do. ""We have to move faster"" because extremist groups are more widespread in traditional media such as newspapers and radio stations, which are still consumed by more people than new media such as Web sites, she said. The extremists' lure . Some extremists are adept at using technology and new media as well. The killings of journalist Daniel Pearl, U.S. businessman Nicholas Berg and Eugene Armstrong, an American contractor working in Iraq, were all recorded and later broadcast on the Web. It's long been a concern that the Web is being used by extremist groups such as al Qaeda to recruit young Muslims to their cause. However, Bruce Etling, who co-authored recent studies of the Arabic and Persian blogospheres at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society, said he found little evidence of such activity. ""In the Arabic blogosphere we found no specific clusters related to extremism, and when it was discussed, it tended to be in negative terms,"" he said. ""It was a counter-narrative we were surprised to find."" There are several possible reasons why, he explained. It's difficult for extremist groups to maintain a static presence on the Web -- they constantly have to move to avoid being found. Additionally, popular sites such as Facebook have strict terms of usage, which make it difficult for extremist groups -- and their sympathizers -- to build a following. Aslan, who is also the executive editor of the social-networking Web site Mecca.com, said that research has consistently shown that the Internet is not an effective recruiting tool for extremists. He said extremist groups use the Web more as a marketing and communication tool. ""Nobody, absolutely nobody, straps a bomb on their body because they were recruited from the Internet,"" he said. ""It takes an enormous amount of personal face-to-face contact and time in order to recruit a young person into the cause of jihad."" The Web and the streets . Observers say that like other young people around the world, Muslims mostly use technology such as cell phones and the Web for social and recreational reasons, not political. Jared Cohen traveled through the Middle East from 2004 through 2006 for his book, ""Children of Jihad: A Young American's Travels Among the Youth of the Middle East."" He joined the U.S. State Department in September, 2006. He said his travels showed him that the same tools young Muslims are using to socialize also are helping them organize. While at an underground party in Iran a few years ago, he asked the Iranians how they heard about the gathering. They told him that if he were to go to the marketplace during the day and turn on his Bluetooth, he could receive random messages with details on where to go and at what time. Western-style parties and music are prohibited in Iran, so young people hold them secretly to evade security. Cohen said the partygoers were dismissive when asked if they were afraid of the security forces finding out. ""No one over 30 knows what Bluetooth does,"" the young Iranians told him. That knowledge and tech savviness played a significant role in the recent protests after the disputed Iranian election. Protesters used Twitter, cell phones and other social-networking tools to organize and spread word of what was happening on the streets. The impact on Islam: A new identity? The post-election fallout in Iran is one example that portends a broader generational and hierarchical struggle in the Muslim community, some experts say. There are a lot of young Muslims. By some estimates, about 60 percent of Muslims in the Middle East are under the age of 30. ""What the printing press is to Christianity in the 16th century, that's what the Internet is doing to Islam now,"" Aslan said. ""It has opened up the monopoly over the interpretation of Islam that used to solely belong to the religious class."" Some clerical authorities, well aware of the challenges posed to their influence by the powers of the Web, are becoming more tech savvy and are building a digital presence, Aslan says. But their interpretations and authority increasingly have competition from sites created by young Muslims such as al Shafei and online communities found on Facebook and Twitter. However, emerging technology also could be a force that helps forge a new, more global Islamic identity. Syrian Muslims can now talk to Muslims in Pakistan, Indonesia, the U.S. or Europe. ""During the 20th century, the parents of this generation were struggling to define for themselves some conception of a pan-Arab or pan-Muslim unity,"" Aslan said. ""But that was elusive because there are so many things geopolitically that separate the Muslim world. ""With the Internet, those boundaries, those borders are irrelevant.""","The number of young Muslims using the Web is rising, experts say .
They're using it to express themselves and connect with others .
These tools also are providing a way to organize socially and politically ."
"(CNN) -- Here's what Katie Roche expected when she went into the hospital for spine surgery: two titanium rods, a bone graft, 17 screws in her vertebrae, eight hours in the operating room, and a week's stay in the hospital to recover. Here's what she didn't expect on top of all that: sharing a hospital room with a feverish 6-year-old and contracting a nasty bacterial infection her mother says nearly killed her. ""She got so weak she couldn't even get out of bed to go to the bathroom -- I had to carry her,"" says her mother, Kathleen Roche. ""For about 48 hours, I didn't think we'd have Katie with us much longer."" Because of the infection she picked up at the hospital, Katie, who was 19 at the time, dropped from 120 to 90 pounds. The bacterium that made her so sick is called Clostridium difficile, and according to a study out this week, it's more common than ever among hospitalized children in the United States, and children who get it are more likely to die or require surgery. The study found Clostridium difficile infections in hospitalized children went up 15% per year from 1997, when there were 3,565 infections, to 2006, when there were 7,779 infections. The study looked at 10.5 million pediatric patients from 1997 to 2006, of whom 21,274, or 0.2%, had C. diff, as the bacteria are commonly called. The study was published this week in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine. ""This is huge, and really concerning,"" says Dr. Peter Pronovost, director of the Quality and Safety research group at Johns Hopkins University. What's really disturbing, he says, is that these children didn't have to get sick. ""Most of these infections are preventable,"" he added. Katie's story . Katie was a healthy 19-year-old avid soccer and volleyball player when she went into a New York City hospital in August 2008 for surgery to correct her scoliosis, or curvature of the spine. The surgery was successful, and she was discharged six days later doing well, except for a low-grade fever. A few days after she returned home to Katonah, a suburb of New York, Katie took a turn for the worse when the incisions on her back opened up and she began to feel weak. Her mother called the doctor, and he told her to bring Katie back to the hospital. Doctors found Katie had an infection -- not C. diff, but another bacterium -- and did a surgery to clear it up. ""When I woke up from that surgery I thought that was it, I was done, but they told me I'd be having another surgery in 48 hours,"" she remembers. ""And then I had to have another one, and then another one."" Katie and her parents didn't know it, but her situation was the perfect storm for a C. diff infection. She was taking massive doses of intravenous antibiotics, which kill the good bacteria in the gut, and C. diff thrives in the absence of good bacteria. ""I was throwing up all the time, and was so weak that one day I just blacked out in my hospital bed,"" she remembers. The antibiotic Flagyl cleared up the C. diff, but by that time it had ravaged her intestines. ""It took six months for me to eat normally again,"" she remembers. ""There's no excuse"" Across the country in California, Pacific Hospital of Long Beach has fixed its C. diff problem. Three years ago, the hospital had 5.3 C. diff infections for every 1,000 hospital admissions, and in the past three years it's had none at all, according to Dr. Alfonso Torress-Cook, epidemiologist for the hospital. ""It's frustrating, because some hospitals say there's nothing they can do about their C. diff rates,"" he says. ""But that's no excuse. They could do a lot of things."" Based on Pacific Hospital's success, here are some things parents can do to protect their children from C.diff when they're in the hospital. For more information on preventing other types of hospital infections, see information from The Empowered Patient and the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths. 1. Give your child yogurt . At Pacific, patients at high risk of C. diff are given yogurt because it helps restore the good bacteria in the gut that in turn help fight off bad bacteria. If your hospital doesn't offer yogurt, Torress-Cook suggests that you bring it in yourself and that one serving a day is enough to help protect your child. If a child can't eat, he can take probiotic supplements containing lactobacillus. For babies, breast milk helps protect against C. diff infections. 2. Know the signs of C. diff infection . If your child has watery diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, fast breathing, or is extremely sleepy, ask your doctor if it could be a    C. diff infection. ""It's not any one symptom, but the whole picture that's important,"" Pronovost says. ""If as a parent your gut tells you your child just isn't normal, there's likely truth in that."" He adds that parents sometimes notice signs of infection before doctors or nurses. ""Parents are with their kids all the time,"" he says. ""And nurses are by the bedside for 12 hours. As the attending physician, I actually have the least amount of time with the patient."" 3. Clean everything . C. diff spreads when someone touches the feces of an infected person, and then touches someone else, or touches a surface, such as a doorknob, that someone else will later touch. At Pacific, officials credit much of their success against the bacteria to a thorough cleaning of every room, even making sure to change the mop head between rooms. Torress-Cook recommends bringing your own disinfectant wipes and cleaning commonly touched surfaces, such as bedrails. The Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths has more information on how routine cleaning by hospital staff might not be enough to control C. diff. 4. Ask for a private room . Kathleen Roche says they'll never know how Katie got sick, but they wonder if she got it from a feverish little girl who shared a room with Katie during both her first and second hospital stays. The Centers for Disease Control recommends that a patient with   C. diff have his or her own room. If you're concerned your child's roommate is ill -- or that your child is ill -- you can ask to be separated. 5. Make sure hospital staff wears glove, gowns . After Katie was moved into her own room, her parents were told to wear gowns to cover their clothing and prevent the spread of their daughter's infection to themselves and others. They noticed, however, that doctors and nurses did not wear gowns when visiting their daughter. ""There should be no difference whatsoever between precautions for the parents and precautions for the staff,"" Pronovost says. ""If there is a difference, it's likely the staff is being noncompliant."" If you see doctors and nurses aren't gowning up or washing their hands, tell them, Pronovost advises. ""As a parent I know we worry we're going to piss off the doctor if we ask too many questions,"" he says. ""But the reality is it's your child's life on the line, so it's worth taking a risk.""","Katie dropped from 120 to 90 pounds because of the infection she picked up at the hospital .

"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- The luge track on which a Georgian athlete died during an Olympic training run will reopen Saturday after officials found it had no deficiencies, the Vancouver Olympic committee and International Luge Federation said. Officials will, however, modify the track at the curve where the crash happened to prevent the possibility of another fatal accident, they said. The decision to reopen the track at the Whistler Sliding Center came after the British Columbia Coroners Service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police concluded their on-scene investigations. The Coroners Service is responsible for investigating all sudden deaths. Technical officials from the International Luge Federation further investigated the accident before announcing the track would reopen. Georgian luge athlete Nodar Kumaritashvili, 21, was on his final official training run when he had a ""serious crash"" near the end of the 4,500-foot-long course Friday afternoon. As he came out of the course's 16th and last turn, Kumaritashvili was thrown from his sled and struck a steel pole at the side of the track. Although he was given CPR at the scene and taken to a hospital, doctors were unable to revive him, the International Olympic Committee said. Kumaritashvili had been scheduled to compete in the men's singles luge event, which begins Saturday. The track was closed after the accident. The Vancouver Olympic Committee and the luge federation, known by its French initials FIL, outlined their findings in a joint statement. ""It appears after a routine run, the athlete came late out of curve 15 and did not compensate properly to make correct entrance into curve 16,"" they said. ""This resulted in a late entrance into curve 16 and although the athlete worked to correct the problem he eventually lost control of the sled resulting in the tragic accident. The technical officials of the FIL were able to retrace the path of the athlete and concluded there was no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track."" The track will reopen after officials raise the walls at the exit of curve 16 and change the ""ice profile,"" they said. ""This was done as a preventative measure, in order to avoid that such an extremely exceptional accident could occur again,"" the statement said. The FIL said it will resume men's training Saturday morning with two full training runs before competition takes place as scheduled at 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET). Luge is often called the ""fastest sport on ice."" Sliders use their legs and shoulders to steer small fiberglass sleds down an icy track, at times approaching or surpassing speeds of 90 mph, according to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics Web site. They are positioned on their backs with their feet straight out in front of them and their heads back to be as aerodynamic as possible. Sports Illustrated's David Epstein, who is covering the Olympics for the magazine, told CNN's ""Situation Room"" that the Whistler course is the fastest in the world ""and not by a little."" He noted that while most luge courses ""flatten out"" around the 11th turn, the Whistler track ""just keeps on dropping so there's really kind of no break from gathering speed toward the end."" Epstein said some athletes had been complaining about the speed of the course and speculating that this Winter Games could be the first time the sport sees a competitor hit 100 mph.","Olympic track where luger died will reopen Saturday with changes to course .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian President Inacio Lula da Silva said Monday the government will do everything possible to help victims of flooding and mudslides that have killed at least 229 people and left thousands homeless. Lula said he will immediately make available 200 million Brazilian reais (about $112 million) in emergency funding to the state of Rio de Janeiro, where heavy rains that started Tuesday have caused widespread death and destruction. ""We can now say that the Brazilian people are saddened by what has happened in Rio de Janeiro and asking God, praying much, that it stops raining and Rio can return to normality,"" Lula was quoted as saying by the state-run Agencia Brasil news service. The largest number of victims from Wednesday's landslides have occurred in the city of Niteroi, where 146 people have died, Agencia Brasil said Sunday evening, citing fire department officials. An additional 150 people are believed dead and still buried in the mud in Niteroi, the news outlet said. Niteroi is located across the bay from the city of Rio de Janeiro. Another 63 people have died in the state of Rio de Janeiro, fire officials said. In addition, 16 deaths have been recorded in the city of Sao Goncalo, adjacent to Niteroi, and one each in Petropolis, Paracambi, Mage and Nilopolis, authorities said. More than 160 people have been injured and about 5,000 have been left homeless, officials said. Many of the deaths have occurred from mudslides in flimsy shantytowns built on the sides of hills overlooking the metro Rio area. Rio state Governor Sergio Cabral said Brazil would invest 1 billion reais (about $562 million) to construct housing, Agencia Brasil reported. The money, he said, will come from nearly 5 billion reais (about $2.8 billion) set aside in the national treasury for construction connected with the 2012 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics, both of which Brazil will host. More rain was forecast for Monday and the next few days.","Death toll climbs to at least 229; thousands left homeless .

"(CNN) -- Cesc Fabregas has reacted to speculation over his future by insisting he is ""wholeheartedly committed to Arsenal"". Fabregas has again moved quickly to quell suggestions he is looking to leave Arsenal. The Spain midfielder has been linked with moves to former club Barcelona and big-spending Real Madrid in recent days, and was quoted in a report on Thursday berating his team-mates' ""impotence"" in their attempts to win silverware. However, Fabregas has hit back at suggestions he could be ready to quit the Emirates Stadium and told www.arsenal.com: ""I'm not sure how many times I need to talk directly about my commitment to Arsenal as I continue to say the same thing over and over again, but it appears that every time I have spoken to the Spanish media recently, my words have bounced back to England, leaving question marks about my future. Check out the world's 20 most wanted players . ""So, for anyone who is unclear or may have misunderstood what my position is, let me make myself absolutely crystal clear. I am wholeheartedly committed to Arsenal and my future lies with this great club."" In this morning's report, Fabregas revealed his frustration at the Gunners' trophy drought which stretches back to the FA Cup final of 2005. Comparing his situation to that of Cristiano Ronaldo, who is poised to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid after a glorious spell at Old Trafford, the 22-year-old was quoted as saying: ""The absence of titles at Arsenal is what angers me the most. ""Cristiano said he's leaving Manchester United because he had nothing else to win. For me right now it is the exact opposite, seeing the impotence. ""This year we wanted it, we were giving everything -- but we couldn't reach the level that everyone expected of Arsenal."" In Thursday afternoon's statement, Fabregas did not attempt to downplay his anger. However, he insists that is a motivation to improve the club's fortunes, rather than a reason to throw in the towel and head for his homeland. ""It is a fact that we have not won a trophy for four years and yes, I am angry about that, but that anger stems from the deep deep desire I have to win things with Arsenal,"" he said. ""I care about this club and believe in this team. I am proud to captain this team and proud to wear the shirt. It really upsets me when people express my thoughts otherwise.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The new Italian Serie A season kicks off with the first round of fixtures this weekend -- Fanzone details what to expect from the forthcoming campaign: . So what's new? The Serie A managerial merry-go-round produced its usual raft of changes with over a third of clubs set to begin the season with a different coach from the previous campaign. Carlo Ancelotti's departure to Chelsea from AC Milan is the most high-profile change, with former Rossoneri hero Leonardo moving from his role as technical director at the club to take over as head coach. Walter Zenga's success in guiding unfancied Catania to a mid-table finish last season saw him make a controversial switch to bitter Sicilian rivals Palermo, with Gianluca Atzori replacing him at the Stadio Angelo Massimino. Who do you think will win the Italian Serie A title? Sound Off below. Delio Rossi parted company with Lazio, who appointed Davide Ballardini, while Luigi Del Neri left Atalanta to take over at Sampdoria with Angelo Gregucci taking the reins at the Bergamo club. Elsewhere, promoted Bari dispensed with the services of Antonio Conte and handed the job to much-traveled Giampiero Ventura, while Livorno have brought in veteran Vittorio Russo to work alongside Gennaro Ruotolo as the latter does not hold the relevant coaching badges. On the playing front, the major story was the transfer of Kaka from AC Milan to Real Madrid for $92 million, and the club spent part of that money on Klaas-Jan Huntelaar who arrived from the Spanish outfit for a fee in the region of $21m.  CNN's Pedro Pinto previews the coming campaign. » . Inter sold Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Barcelona, with Samuel Eto'o moving to the Nerazzurri as part of the deal. Juventus strengthened their squad with the capture of Brazilian playmaker Diego from Werder Bremen for $34m while Fabio Cannavaro returned to Turin from Real Madrid on a free transfer. The pressure will be on Diego to have an impact at Juventus following his move from Werder Bremen. Key players: The arrivals of Eto'o and Diego Milito have grabbed all of the headlines for Inter, but it could well be 19-year-old striker Mario Balotelli who will provide the firepower for Inter's title defense after showing signs of his huge potential last season. Kaka's departure has left a void at AC Milan, so a big season is needed from heir-apparent Alexandre Pato while Marco Borriello will hope to overcome last season's injury problems to establish himself in attack. Juventus paid serious money for Diego and he will be expected to justify his price tag, while boss Ciro Ferrara will hope evergreen pair Alessandro Del Piero and Fabio Cannavaro have one last Scudetto title left in them. Elsewhere, Geona's capture of poacher Hernan Crespo from Inter could prove to be inspired if he can recapture his best form, while striker Robert Acquafresca and goalkeeper Andrea Consigli at Atalanta are the best of the next generation of stars. New Palermo coach Walter Zenga has talked up his side's chances of breaking into the top three this season. Key clubs: AC Milan coach Leonardo speaks with authority and intelligence about the game but it would be a surprise if he delivered the title in his first season in charge, so Juventus should provide Inter with their main challenge for the Scudetto. New Palermo coach Zenga has talked up his team's chances of breaking into the top three this season, while Sampdoria's formidable striker pairing of Antonio Cassano and Giampaolo Pazzini ensure they will be among the chasing pack. Roma face a season of uncertainty with Rosella Sensi, the head of the Italpetroli oil business that owns two-thirds of the club, attempting to manage debts of $420m while city rivals Lazio are currently a team in transition. At the wrong end of the table newly-promoted sides Bari, Livorno and Parma will be among the strugglers and will be joined by Chievo, Siena and Bologna in the battle to avoid relegation. Striker Samuel Eto'o arrived at Inter as part of Zlatan Ibrahimovic's transfer to Barcelona. Expert view: CNN's Terry Badoo - ""Whatever the outcome of this year's Serie A, it is important to the Italian football authorities that the league gets noticed. ""Their goals were obvious in preseason when Inter and AC Milan went on a high-profile tour of the U.S. and the Italian Super Cup between champions Inter and cup winners Lazio took place in Beijing! ""The reason? Italy's top brass feel they've been left behind by the English Premier League and Spain's La Liga in terms of global appeal, star quality and purchasing power, with a resultant lack of achievement in the Champions League. ""Of course, good football gets you noticed. But, in the last four seasons, the one Italian club to produce it consistently are defending champions Inter who are seeking their fifth title on the spin. ""The question is -- are they hungry enough to claim five in a row? Well, in Jose Mourinho they have a coach savvy enough to make it happen. And, with the bargain signing of striker Eto'o in exchange for Ibrahimovic, the 'Special One' feels he's done the deal of the summer. ""But, where do Mourinho's priorities lie? The Serie A or the Champions League? And if it's the latter, does he have a deep enough squad to compete on both fronts? ""Certainly AC Milan are not favorites. The loss of Ancelotti, retirement of Paolo Maldini, sale of Kaka and return of David Beckham to Los Angeles Galaxy (at least until January), has put a hopeful rather than optimistic expression on the face of new boss Leonardo. ""So Juventus, in their third season back in the top flight following demotion for corruption, look ripe to claim the title they last won in 2003. ""Big-money signings Diego and Felipe Melo are viewed as potentially key components, and having replaced Claudio Ranieri in favor of Ferrara, the jigsaw may be complete. ""But, if you fancy a flutter on an outsider then Palermo could be a decent bet under Zenga, and with the signing of 20-year-old Argentinean sensation Javier Pastore in their ranks they could just surprise the established elite. ""Time will tell as with all predictions. So, pile on the pasta, break out a nice Chianti, and let the good times roll.""","Serie A has lost two star players to La Liga in Kaka and Zlatan Ibrahimovic .

"(CNN) -- The discovery of hard plastic inside packages prompted a nationwide recall of 72,000 pounds of canned chicken salad, one of several recalls involving poultry and meat products issued through U.S. food safety authorities in recent days. The Suter Company is recalling 8.2-ounce packages of the ""Bumble Bee Lunch on the Run Chicken Salad Complete Lunch Kit"" and 3.5-ounce packages of ""Bumble Bee Chicken Salad with Crackers,"" according to a statement released Sunday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service. While the company is headquartered in Sycamore, Illinois, its products are sold from coast to coast. The recalled products -- which have a August 2011 ""best-by"" date for the lunch kit, and February 2012 corresponding date for the cracker package -- were put together and shipped out to distributors and stores between August 14 and 28 of this year. The recall was prompted by complaints from people who found pieces of loose plastic inside their Bumble Bee packages. The federal agency noted in its release that it hasn't received any reports of people getting hurt or sick as a result. The recall is a Class II, which means there is a ""remote probability of adverse health consequences,"" according to the Food Safety and Inspection Service. Meanwhile, two unrelated and separate but potentially more dangerous recalls announced late last week were categorized as Class I, equating to a ""reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death."" Federal food safety authorities said Friday that Diana's Mexican Food Products, of Lawndale, California, is recalling 41,670 pounds of chicken tamales. The tamales contain whey, a known allergen. But the packages don't note the whey on its labels, said the Food Safety and Inspection Service, potentially imperiling consumers.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It is an unusual art auction where making money isn't a great concern. But that is the case this weekend when a series of paintings go on the block with the purpose of drawing attention to climate change. This picture by Andrew Bartolo, 15, of Malta is one of 26 for sale in the UNEP's ""Paint for the Planet"" auction. This weekend, 26 paintings with the theme of climate change will be auctioned in New York City to raise money for children most adversely affected by global warming. The ""Paint for the Planet"" auction is sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and will spotlight the work of young artists across the globe. ""Half of the world's population is today below 25 years of age,"" said Achim Steiner, executive director of UNEP. ""The auction is a way of communicating their perspective and the auction and the money is in a sense a companion benefit."" Pre-bids have started and early indications suggest that all 26 paintings will be sold for at least the opening bid of $500 apiece. The paintings are the best of some 200,000 entries received during the past 17 years of the UNEP's annual International Children's Painting Competition. Entries came from as far afield as Burundi, Armenia, Thailand and Colombia. ""Some of these kids were only seven, eight nine or ten years old when they painted these things"", Steiner said. ""The imagination and imagery is stunning... and the humor. There's one of a polar bear taking off his costume and it's a polar bear in a bikini."" Penguins also are featured prominently. Fifteen-year-old Andrew Bartolo from Malta secured third place with his picture of penguins frolicking on a beach. Some are tossing beach balls while others sit nearby in a fridge. Of his picture, Andrew says: ""I have painted a scene that, though slightly extreme, gives an insight into a possible future, one where animals lose their homes and are forced to migrate to unfamiliar territories... Due to our wrong decisions, these creatures are suffering just as much as we are or more. Daniela Melendez, 14, of Colombia strikes a more upbeat note with her painting showing the globe and people harnessing alternative forms of energy. ""With my painting I wanted to tell people that it's easier and better when we work together... we TOGETHER are doing it, together we can work it out,"" says Daniela. It's that kind of optimism about the future that the UNEP hopes to propagate through the promotion and sale of the 26 paintings. Another 26 paintings will join them in a traveling exhibit that will follow climate talks around the world until their climax in Copenhagen in December 2009. The auction and exhibition are part of the new global campaign launched today; ""UNite to Combat Climate Change"" calls for a definitive agreement on climate change to be formed at those talks in Denmark. In conjunction with the campaign, the UNEP has released results of a survey it says highlights how concerned young people are about climate change. The vast majority of nearly 2,000 children surveyed in five countries decisively said that climate change was a top concern: Brazil (96 percent), South Africa (91 percent), India (85 percent), the United States (82 percent) and Russia (70 percent). The majority of those surveyed -- except those in India -- agreed that it was necessary to take major steps very soon: Brazil (88 percent), South Africa (81 percent), Russia (75 percent), and the United States (61 percent). In India, most thought it was necessary to take ""modest"" steps over the coming years (53 percent). ""Children have a way of questioning established wisdom and that is part of opening up new ways of thinking and acting,"" Steiner said. ""So I think we need to mobilize the energy and the enthusiasm and the commitment and the faith of young people to get involved in these issues."" Live bidding for the paintings starts on Saturday at 8 p.m. ET at the Harvard Club in New York. Eager buyers outside the United States are being encourage to lodge pre-bids or to participate online through eBay.","Collection of children's art to be auctioned by the UN on Saturday in New York .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As an organization they're used to investing billions of dollars in scientific experiments that further our knowledge of earth and space. But the only bill to speak of on this occasion is orange and attached to the body of a rubber duck. Scientists from NASA hope that rubber ducks will help them better understand glacier movements. In the name of climate change science, researchers at NASA have dropped 90 rubber ducks into holes of Greenland's fastest moving glacier: the Jakobshavn Glacier in Baffin Bay. Scientists remain unsure as to why glaciers speed up their movement in the summer months and it is hoped that the rubber ducks -- labeled with the words ""science experiment"" and ""reward"" in three languages, along with an email address -- will shed some light on the phenomenon. One theory is that the summer sun melts ice on the surface of the glacier which creates pools of water which then flow into moulins -- narrow tubular shafts in the glacier. These then transport the water from the top to the underside of the glacier. It's thought that this base water acts as a lubricant to speed up the movement of the glacier towards the sea. It is hoped the ducks will help show how the water moves through the ice. In conjunction with the ducks, Nasa has also launched a GPS probe which they hope will tell them more about the inner workings of the glacier. So far, neither the probe nor any of the ducks have turned up. Alberto Behar of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California told Reuters: ""We haven't heard back but it may take some time until somebody actually finds it and decides to send us an e-mail that they have found it."" The Jakobshavn Glacier is responsible for seven percent of all ice which is peeling off Greenland and its ice sheets could contribute to sea levels rising this century. The glacier's menace was also felt last century. Experts believe that it was the source of the iceberg which sank the Titanic in 1912. It's not the first time rubber ducks have helped scientists track water flows. Thousands fell into the sea in 1992 when a container ship bound for Seattle from China shed its load in a storm in the Pacific Ocean. The ducks spent years at sea and washed up in all corners of the globe, telling oceanographers much about the surface currents of the oceans.","NASA scientists launch a flotilla of 90 rubber ducks to investigate ice melt in glacier .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Malini Mehra is a woman in a hurry. She's late for a meeting with Al Gore's people, the batteries on her cell phone are running out, and besides, UK call roaming charges are ""horrendous."" Malini Mehra: ""We simply cannot afford to be timid on climate change."" I've managed to get her on the phone from Delhi, one of the three cities that serve as a base for the Center for Social Markets (CSM), the organization she founded in 2000. By Mehra's own admission, she is ""in perpetual motion, regularly traveling between my offices and homes in Calcutta, Delhi and London."" Mehra's not only on a tight timetable today -- the way she sees it she has just two years to change the Indian government's position on climate change. ""2008 and 2009 are very, very important years for us. These are the years before we reach a global deal."" The timetable for a global pact was agreed at the UN climate talks in Bali last December. The Deal will replace the Kyoto agreement which runs out in 2012. After Principal Voices . Principal Voices last heard from Malini Mehra in 2006 when she took part in the Collaborative Corporation panel at the Design Museum in London. At the time, she stressed the need for individuals to make changes, however small, to contribute to the global effort to reverse climate change. In two years she says a lot has changed. ""For the first time people are talking about climate change in a much most focused way."" ""Consumers have become better informed and more demanding. But in a marketplace that's buzzing with information overload they've also become more confused."" ""It's often not easy to know what the 'right thing' to do is,"" she says. ""That's why we need a greater emphasis on 'personal responsibility' not just 'corporate responsibility' which can leave us having greater expectations of others than of ourselves."" The challenge . Mehra has appointed herself chief antagonist to the Indian government on climate change. She's not alone. Environmentalists within India and around the world are urging the government to do more to reduce the country's carbon emissions. In late March, Greenpeace warned that 50 million people from India, and another 75 million from Bangladesh, could be displaced if global warming was allowed to rise above the two degree tipping point, the point when it becomes too late to act. Greenpeace campaign director Divya Raghunandan says, ""The Indian government has wrongly forsaken mitigation for adaptation and the forthcoming session of Parliament must debate this wisdom which has serious long term consequences."" India's view is that the developed world has a long history of producing carbon emissions and that its recent economic development should not be unduly restrained by having to meet restrictive global targets. In an address to the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, ""We cannot continue with a global development model in which some countries continue to maintain high carbon emissions, while the development options available for developing countries get constrained."" read full address here . He's offered to limit India's per capita carbon emissions to the average carbon emission of developed industrial countries. With a population of more than one billion people, a per capita target would give India more room to maneuver. Changing attitudes . Malini Mehra will be among the activists poring over the Indian government's National Plan of Action on Climate Change when it's released in June. She's hoping there'll be a shift in the government's attitude and thinks that pressure from the public could be enough to prompt a rethink. ""Our job is to give voice to that public challenge and re-frame the debate from a victim-led 'can't do-won't do' mentality to a 'can do-must do' debate based on hope and good propositions,"" she says. ""One in every six people on the planet is Indian and tomorrow's world is Indian. We simply cannot afford to be timid on climate change. It's high time we owned the problem and started to change the world to deal with it.""","Malini Mehra on mission to change attitudes to climate change in India .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Later this summer, a motor rally will make its way across Europe. Nothing strange in that you might think. But this is a race with a difference -- a ""banger rally"" if you like -- and one with a well-tuned environmental message. Andy Pag is leading a ""chip fat"" rally to Greece in August 2008. The ""Grease to Greece"" expedition will attempt to travel from the UK to Greece powered exclusively by chip fat scrounged from a variety of restaurants, kebab shops and burger vans en route. Organizer Andy Pag said: ""The aim is to see if using vegetable oil for long distances is practical and feasible, and to have a bit of a laugh on the way."" Pag, who lives in London, is no stranger to environmentally-friendly jaunts. In 2007, Pag successfully drove a bio-truck powered by waste chocolate from the UK to Timbuktu. The starting point for this summer's road trip is, not surprisingly, a 1950's style greasy spoon cafe in South London. The team will then set off for the continent traveling down through Germany -- stopping off at the Nurburgring for the Grease Lightening stage -- before heading off towards Austria and then Italy, before following the Croatian coast down to Greece. The ""fat finding"" mission, as organizers have dubbed it, will start on the 16th August. It will take around two weeks to reach the finish line. If teams find waste oil hard to come by they can load up with fresh cooking oil from supermarkets. But the aim is to show that carbon neutral motoring, using waste fat as a biofuel, is achievable. Pag told CNN that he currently has 15 spaces filled and that there are still a few places left. ""All you need is a diesel car,"" he said. With conventional fuel prices high and rising, Pag couldn't have picked a better time to take on the challenge. Next year, he plans to fly from the UK to China powered by fuel created from landfill waste. The idea is to highlight the process of making low-carbon aviation fuel. ""It's such an exciting concept because it could revolutionize the aviation industry and the way we think about travel,"" Pag said. ""The key factors are that it needs to economically and environmentally viable. So far the experiments that have been done haven't really hit the mark yet, but it's good that they are developing the ideas.""

"(CNN) -- Most artists have to wait years -- or perhaps an eternity -- to earn serious money from their work. Aidan Reed, on the other hand, earned more than $83,000 in a few weeks, and he's only 5. Aidan's art is of monsters -- green ones, black ones, scary ones, silly ones. The people who buy his drawings aren't necessarily art lovers or monster lovers. They just want to help Aidan, whose leukemia was diagnosed three months ago, and whose parents nearly had to sell their house because of the financial difficulties of dealing with cancer. When Aidan's family started selling his drawings online in early October, his parents thought they'd sell a few each week. They never imagined it could more than make up for the income they were losing because Aidan's father, Wiley Reed, had to take unpaid time off  to be with Aidan during treatments. ""We were in the hospital with Aidan, and my husband and I were talking about selling the house, which I didn't want to do. I was really upset,"" said his mother, Katie Reed. ""While we were there, we found out we'd sold over 2,000 drawings. I just fell down crying. It was so awesome. I knew we'd finally be OK."" ""He's a great artist, but I never thought he'd be famous at 5,"" adds Reed, who lives in Clearwater, Kansas, and gave birth to Aidan's little brother, Amry, just 12 days after Aidan's cancer diagnosis. An aunt's love . The idea for selling Aidan's artwork came from his father's sister, Mandi Ostein, who lives in Peoria, Illinois, and was trying to think of a way to help from afar. She had to look no further than her newborn son's nursery for answers. A few months before he got sick, Aidan had sent her some of his drawings to decorate his cousin's room. ""I'd sold items I've made on etsy.com -- purses, bags, clothes -- and I thought we could sell Aidan's drawings there, too,"" she says. Ostein opened up a shop,Aidan's Monsters, on the popular website. ""When I first mentioned it to my brother, he thought it was crazy,"" she adds. ""But I thought we could sell 60 by Thanksgiving."" Instead, she sold nearly 7,000 by Thanksgiving for $12 a piece. She says sales really took off when a friend of hers convinced a website called regretsy.com, which usually pokes fun of the products on etsy.com, to promote sales of Aidan's drawings. Now selling Aidan's art has become a full-time job, in addition to taking care of her baby. ""I print, package, ship and answer e-mails from home,"" she says. ""Upstairs is the printing department, downstairs is the shipping department, and wherever I am is the PR department."" Ostein says she knows why Aidan's drawings are selling so phenomenally well. ""People really want to help,"" Ostein says. ""They say Aidan's story really touches them."" Aidan's story . Aidan was a healthy 5-year-old until late this past summer when he started having fevers that wouldn't go away, no matter how many medicines his pediatrician prescribed. Then on the weekend of September 10, he developed a terrible cough, and his parents noticed bruises on his body. ""Usually Aidan tells us if he's hurt himself or run into something, but he couldn't explain these bruises at all,"" Reed says. The Reeds took Aidan to the pediatrician's office that Monday, and blood tests confirmed the worst: Aidan had leukemia. He started treatment the next day at Wesley Medical Center in Wichita, Kansas, receiving several rounds of chemotherapy. Wiley Reed works for Cessna training factory workers, and his insurance is good. While the family is responsible for a $250 co-payment when Aidan goes to the hospital, most of the rest of his care is covered. What set them back financially is that Wiley has had to take unpaid time off work. His wife stays at home with Aidan and his baby brother, so the family had to go without any income. ""We were buying cheaper groceries and cutting way back on clothes, and we're not big shoppers to begin with,"" Katie Reed says. ""The money from the drawings really relieved us. When insurance isn't enough . Reed says she never imagined how expensive an illness could be even when you do have good insurance. ""If I were to see this story, I would think to myself, 'These people have insurance. What are they talking about?' "" Reed says. In addition to her husband's lost wages, the family has had other expenses, such as buying food at the hospital instead of cooking at home. The Reeds' situation isn't unusual, says Jeanie Barnett, director of communications for CancerCare, an organization that helps people affected by cancer. ""Cancer is an incredibly expensive disease,"" Barnett says. ""And no one budgets to have cancer."" There are lost wages, which the Reeds faced, as well as transportation costs to and from the hospital. Plus, even good insurance doesn't cover all the costs. ""You can get socked at the pharmacy for $900 a month, or even $3,000 a month, and that's with insurance,"" Barnett says. Families have become clever about how to raise money, she adds. For example, parents of one child with cancer held a ""pie-a-thon,"" cooking pies for 48 hours straight and selling them. For help facing the financial burdens of cancer, contact CancerCare or the Cancer Financial Assistance Coalition. And a previous Empowered Patient column also offered advice:After cancer diagnosis, what comes next? Barnett urges patients and their families who are having fundraisers to beware of the taxman: If you raise a lot of money, you could get pushed into a higher income bracket and face higher taxes. To learn more about smart fundraising, see page 3 of this guide from the National Marrow Donor Program. Aidan's future . The Reeds are right now trying to figure out now how much of their income from the drawings is taxable. Some of it they've used to pay their mortgage and other expenses, but some has also been used for art supplies for Aidan. Ostein says sales are still going strong even though she's told customers that for the time being the family is fine. Money from future sales will be put away for later. Wiley Reed is back at work but takes unpaid time off when Aidan has a doctor's appointment. ""He gets a spinal tap every three weeks, and those are not good to go through,"" Katie Reed says. ""I can't emotionally handle it. I always have to leave the room, so Wiley's the one who stays strong for him and holds his hand."" She says the response to Aidan's drawings has helped her emotionally, not just financially. ""I love reading the happy stories people leave on Aidan's blog about how they've been through this, and it does get better,"" she says. ""It's really helped me stay positive through all this because I was really depressed seeing my child have to go through all this not knowing whether he'd make it or not."" As for Aidan, he keeps drawing, sometimes for hours a day, even when he's in the hospital. He recently started to draw jesters (""he loves the hats and the bells,"" his mother says), and he's asked Santa for a four-faced clown mask he saw online for Christmas. Still, monsters are his main theme. ""I don't think he realizes it, but monsters have become iconic for him,"" she says. ""I think he likes them because he's fighting a monster inside himself.""","Aidan Reed, 5, who draws monsters, received a leukemia diagnosis  three months ago .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Imagine if cars ran on household waste, if gas tanks were filled with ethanol made from wood chips. Well, the technology to make it happen is already a reality and companies are now racing to bring this kind of fuel to a gas pump near you. Waste wood can be used to produce ethanol to fuel cars. With the right processing, ethanol can be produced from pretty much any form of organic matter. Cellulosic ethanol is made from the cellulose found in waste materials like wood chips and the non-edible parts of food crops, or from purpose-grown grasses such as switchgrass and miscanthus. These grasses can be grown on land unsuitable for food production, meaning they're not in competition with food crops, and the whole plant can be used to produce fuel, making them a more efficient use of land than traditional biofuels. Because cellulosic ethanol takes much less energy to produce than traditional biofuels, it's an even greener alternative to gasoline. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, cellulosic ethanol produces 85% less greenhouse gases than gasoline. So far, the production of cellulosic ethanol has been limited to pilot plants demonstrating that the technology works, but a number of companies have announced plans to build commercial-scale plants. INEOS Bio, an offshoot of UK-based chemical company INEOS, is soon to announce the location of its first commercial plant, which will produce ethanol from waste materials. The INEOS Bio method involves superheating biomass to produce a synthesis gas that is converted to ethanol by microbes, meaning it utilizes the lignin content of the waste as well as the cellulose. ""We can use a wide range of materials but we want to stick with biodegradable materials. That could be household waste, garden waste, agricultural waste or forestry waste,"" a spokesperson for INEOS Bio told CNN. ""One of the exciting things is that a production plant could well be in a big city, allied to their waste disposal issues. We can take waste and rather than put it into landfill, we can turn it into ethanol. ""This is not a specialist thing; it's not for a few people here and there. We believe we'll be able to mass produce this for millions of cars. And if you use ethanol as a blend with gasoline, which is how it's most commonly used, you could find almost every car is one day running on this,"" the spokesperson added. How do you think our cars will be fuelled in the future? Governments have already committed to using biofuels of some kind as a substitute for gasoline. The EU has required that 10% of petrol and diesel will come from renewable sources by 2020 and the U.S. is aiming to produce 36 billion gallons of biofuel annually by 2022. Currently, biofuels are mostly produced from sugar cane, grain or oil-seed crops, but increasing demand for biofuels has meant an increasing demand for the crops used to make them, and that demand has been blamed for driving up global food prices. There have also been claims that biofuel production in developing countries is accelerating the destruction of rain forests and doubts have been raised about the effectiveness of traditional biofuels in reducing greenhouse gases. The result is that attention is now turning to producing biofuels from other sources. INEOS is one of the world's largest chemical companies and the involvement of big corporations is a sign that the technology is being taken seriously. General Motors has joined forces with U.S. firms Mascoma and Coskata, and Dupont has teamed up with Genencor to develop cellulosic ethanol, promising $140 million of funding for the project. But cost is king and according to Neil Harl, emeritus professor of economics at Iowa State University, price is ultimately what will determine if cellulosic ethanol becomes the fuel of the future. ""You have to do more than demonstrate that it can be done, you have to show that it can be done profitably,"" says Harl, citing a 2007 IMF report on biofuels that describes cellulosic ethanol as twice as expensive to produce as gasoline and 75% more expensive than corn-based ethanol. However, that report was based on oil trading at $65 a barrel and higher oil prices make alternatives like cellulosic ethanol increasingly attractive options, especially when you factor in technological advances. ""Right now funds are flowing out to new technologies but I think it really is going to come down to a question of what will emerge from this array of technological possibilities,"" says Harl. ""As we move forward the question becomes 'what is going to be the long-term least-cost energy source?'""","Cellulosic ethanol can be made from wood, grasses or the waste parts of plants .
INEOS Bio is set to start commercial production of ethanol from waste products .
Production must become more economical if cellulosic ethanol is to succeed ."

"(CNN) -- Goals from Manucho and Flavio gave hosts Angola a welcome boost as they moved top of Africa Cup of Nations Group A with a 2-0 victory over Malawi on Thursday. In the opening match Angola threw away a 4-0 lead to eventually draw with Mali, but home fans were able to celebrate second-time round as they clinched a comfortable two-goal win in Luanda. Angola, who played under the gaze of president Eduardo Jose dos Santos, began the game brightly and almost took the lead in the opening minutes when Manucho volleyed Flavio's cross only for Malawi keeper Swadick Sanudi to smother the ball. The team known as the ""Black Antelopes"" continued to dominate the half and went close again in the 33rd minute when Djalma teed up Manucho but Sanudi was equal to his powerful shot. Angola's attacking approach was maintained after the half-time interval and they broke the deadlock three minutes into the half through Flavio. The energetic Djalma broke down the left flank before he whipped a dangerous cross into the penalty area which was met by the head of Flavio who directed the ball past Sanudi. Former Manchester United striker Manucho doubled the advantage in the 54th minute when he held off a strong challenge from Malawi captain Peter Mponda and produced a neat close-range finish. Angola coach Manuel Jose was forced to withdraw Flavio through injury on the hour mark but it was the only sour note in what was morale-boosting win for the hosts. The tournament, which has continued despite the withdrawal of Togo after a deadly machine-gun attack, continued with Algeria clashing with Mali. Defender Rafik Halliche scored the only goal of the game as the Desert Foxes registered their first victory of the tournament with a 1-0 win over in Cidadela . Mali were unable to match the heroics of their first match as they went down to a disciplined Algeria side. The Eagles had the early pressure and Mustapha Yatabare's second-minute free-kick caused problems in the Algerian defence but Mahamadou Diarra was unable to find a teammate with his pull-back after beating Algeria keeper Faouzi Chaouchi to the loose ball. However, Algeria -- known as the Desert Foxes -- dominated the remainder of the half and went close moments later when Karim Ziani's swerving, dipping cross almost caught out Soumaila Diakite in the Mali goal as it struck the top of the crossbar. Rabah Saadane's side continued to press and were rewarded with the opening goal of the game in the 43rd minute when Bakary Soumare brought down Yacine Bezzaz in a dangerous position. Ziani delivered another dangerous ball into the penalty area and Halliche was able to evade the Mali defenders and head the ball past Diakite. Stephen Keshi's side began the second half with renewed purpose and Mali's Seydou Keita forced a fingertip save from Algeria Chaouchi from a narrow angle shortly after the half-time break. But it was a rare chance as Halliche and Madjid Bougherra marshalled the Algeria defence superbly, despite the introduction of Sevilla striker Freddie Kanoute for Mali, to hold on for the win.","Goals from Manucho and Flavio helped hosts Angola move top of Africa Cup of Nations Group A with a 2-0 victory over Malawi on Thursday.

"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and Chief National Correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. Herbert Hale lives on a check of a little less than $17 a week and whatever he can pick up from odd jobs. CHERRY CREEK, South Dakota (CNN) -- The tiny one-room house rests on a hill; no electricity and no running water. A creaky metal cot and a rusting wood-burning stove is all the comfort Herbert Hale says he needs. ""All it is is logs, glue -- dirt and water put together -- then cement and the chicken string,"" Hale says of his home. ""Long as the windows don't break, it's nice and warm in here."" The roof leaks a bit, and the floorboards are rotted in one corner, but Hale isn't one to complain. ""It's home,"" he says, almost under his breath, as he invites a visitor to have a look. Firewood is stacked in one corner inside, and more outside as Hale uses the summer months to stockpile for prairie winters, where 20 below zero is not all that uncommon. He also pulls bunches of long weeds in the prairie grass, to dry for use as a firestarter. ""I have to be careful,"" Hale says matter-of-factly as he pulls a few fistfuls. ""Sometimes there are some snakes. Rattlesnakes. Nothing to mess around with."" He is 54 years old, a member of the Lakota tribe and part of two stunning statistics, even as communities across America deal with the pain and challenges of recession: . Hale worked 16 years as a firefighter. But he began having some back problems in the early 1980s and then, ""cancer caught up with me. I have a brain tumor."" He says he gets a check for just shy of $17 every week from a tribal welfare fund, and tries to find odd jobs to pay for his food and to help out a diabetic sister. But there's a catch: Tiny Cherry Creek has no such jobs. There are one or two one-room homes like Hale's, but it is mostly a collection of a couple dozen simple modular homes provided by a federal and tribal housing program. It doesn't even have a gas station or general store. So Hale heads out most days toward Eagle Butte -- 17 miles up one road and then 21 miles more up the next. A few more twists and, ""It's about 42 to 43 miles, someplace around there."" Herbert Hale can't afford a car. ""Well, I take off, go to my sister's, then get some water and take off. Somebody along the way will pick me up."" Often, that somebody is Bryce In The Woods, a member of the tribal council whose district includes Cherry Creek. ""It is bad,"" he says of the area's economic plight, walking a visitor through the gravel streets where many residents, idle because of the lack of jobs, are sitting out front or shout out a greeting from inside their small homes. To spend a day crossing the reservation is to see a place stunningly beautiful and seemingly forgotten all at once, small, poor communities tucked into the hollows of western South Dakota's Cheyenne River Reservation. The poverty is all the more striking because of the richness of the setting: green and golden rolling hills, roaming horses and cattle, and tall corn and golden sunflowers sprouting from the fertile soil. ""Ziebach County is the No. 1 county statistically with child poverty,"" he said. ""Now that alone is generational, with the trauma of poverty and the broken family."" Breaking that cycle is Bryce In The Woods' obsession. He highlights a bright spot: A building in the community converted to a makeshift classroom and library where residents can get tutoring help and then take the GED --- the high school equivalency exam. ""It is so difficult,"" he says of the challenge facing younger reservation residents. ""Some of our young people join the services, the armed services, some of them go to college or apply to college,"" Bryce In The Woods told us. ""The majority, if they are staying here, end up moving to Rapid City or some of the bigger cities to try to find employment."" In Eagle Butte, the largest community on the reservation, a bustling construction site is a new source of pride. A medical center is under construction, thanks to funding from the Obama administration's stimulus plan, and Bryce In The Woods says about 65 construction-related jobs so far have gone to tribal members. ""At this point I am very appreciative of what we have received,"" Joseph Brings Plenty, the elected tribal chairman, says when we ask if the stimulus funding is enough. ""But as far as expectation, I can say no. There would be a lot more need to be fulfilled by the U.S. government for our tribe before I can say yes."" Outside, Brings Plenty's office is a ""First Americans for Obama"" sign -- a reminder the tribe was an early backer of Barack Obama. Brings Plenty says he hopes the president remembers. ""I can sympathize, empathize, with the demands, with the pressures that are on his shoulders, on his plate and put in front of him,"" Brings Plenty said during a break from a Tribal Council meeting. The biggest help Obama and Congress could give, the chairman and others told us, is greater water rights. The tribe has money for more housing, but can't build because the water pressure is too low and its treatment systems too outdated to handle increased demand. ""I feel that we are forgotten because we don't have that voice out there,"" Chairman Brings Plenty said. ""It's demoralizing in a way for some of our members that go out and receive an education and come back and are unable to get a job here."" To be clear, Chairman Brings Plenty and Bryce In the Woods say not all of the tribe's problems rest with the federal government. Both mentioned obstacles and disagreements born of factional tribal politics and rivalries, which were in full evidence during just a few minutes of the Tribal Council's debate. In The Woods is also a strong advocate for land reforms he says would get the tribe a better deal for grazing rights on its property. Still, they would welcome more economic development help, from the state and from Washington, but say their voices don't always get heard, even in the best of times. ""When it comes down to a vote, a lot of the urban representatives, I don't think they really know the plight on the reservation,"" Bryce In the Woods said. ""I think there is a stereotype out there that all tribes have casinos and that's not true."" Herbert Hale shrugs when asked if Washington has a responsibility to help his struggling community. ""I can't really say,"" he said quietly. ""I'm not into politics to tell you the truth. I was when I was younger, back in the '80s."" Now, he lives the simplest of lives. A few hours of work if he is lucky, and perhaps an hour or two collecting wood, even in the scorching August sun. The temperature neared 100 degrees on the day of our visit, yet Hale's wood stove was warm to the touch. Prairie mornings can still be chilly. More important, memories of winter's past remind Hale of the value of his growing stockpile. ""Sometimes it's a long walk,"" he says. ""Especially in February. Twenty below and I have to walk. Often no cars ... A few times I felt like falling asleep on the road. I told myself, 'Fall asleep, you're froze and you're gone.' I pushed myself to keep walking."" Once home, he has a battery-powered radio and uses a small kerosene lamp to pass time at night reading. He's extra careful because he recently broke its glass chimney, so the flame burns without protection from the winds that can pick up suddenly. Herbert's worries are more immediate than whether the president or any other politician understands his plight. ""They never stopped up here,"" he says.""If they did, I wasn't home."" On the odd jobs in town, $1 here and $5 there adds up -- not too much, but his goals are modest. ""You know, take the trash out. I sweep the front. A few dollars a day wouldn't hurt. That's as good as you need. That's all I care about. One day at a time.""","In nation's poorest county, about 56 percent of residents live below poverty line .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama's January 17 train trip from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Washington is intended to make the inauguration the most open and accessible in history. President-elect Barack Obama's train ride from Philadelphia to Washington will pose myriad security risks. But it is also presenting the U.S. Secret Service with security problems. Miles and miles and miles of them. In addition to the well-publicized ""whistle stops"" in Philadelphia; Wilmington, Delaware; and Baltimore, Maryland, the Presidential Inauguration Committee says the public will have the opportunity to view the train at other locations along its 137-mile route. But the committee has not indicated where those sites will be, and the Secret Service has yet to release what security restrictions will be in place. Security experts say the train ride presents traditional threats to the VIPs on board, as well as countless buildings, homes and warehouses along the route. And there are non-traditional vulnerabilities: scores of bridges and tunnels that could be sabotaged. And, two environmental groups have warned, terrorists could take a page from al Qaeda's playbook, using existing infrastructure, in this case chemical plants along the route, as an attack method. In a letter to the Secret Service, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth wrote that they were worried that security efforts focused on the Obama entourage ""might not extend to the larger community which may suffer serious consequences in case of even one moderately successful terrorist release of ultrahazardous chemicals."" ""We will be urging Mr. Obama and [Vice President-elect Joe] Biden to re-consider"" plans to travel by train, the groups wrote. In response, Secret Service spokesman Eric Zahren told the groups, ""Please be assured, the U.S. Secret Service is working closely with federal, state and local agencies to maintain a safe and secure environment for all of our protectees."" Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, whose department includes the Secret Service, said he is confident of the agency's abilities to protect the president-elect. ""Remember, the Secret Service has taken the president to Iraq and to Afghanistan, to some very hostile places around the world. I'm comfortable that we have the skills, working of course with state and local authorities, to protect the president-elect in Pennsylvania and Baltimore and Washington, D.C.,"" Chertoff said. Chertoff said he is aware of the environmental groups' concerns. ""I suspect it's being done, frankly, largely as a public relations ploy,"" he said. ""I don't think there's any particular threat from chemical plants along the train route."" iReport.com: Send your photos from the train stops . A former Secret Service agent said the agency has had experience with presidential train trips and said authorities typically install chemical, biological and radiological detectors along the route. Amtrak and the Secret Service will not say whether Obama's train car will be armored, though experts say special cars have been used in the past. ""Security will be provided in the air, on the ground and in the water,"" said Amtrak Police Department Chief John O'Connor. ""It's a daunting challenge, but there are many, many police departments that are working together to make this happen."" Once the train reaches its final destination, the presidential inauguration itself will offer an attractive target for terrorists because of ""the historic significance of the nation's first minority president,"" a U.S. intelligence assessment said. The report hastened to add that no specific threat has been detected thus far. The document says the swearing-in of the first minority president ""increases the potential threat, particularly stemming from individuals on the extremist fringe of the white supremacist movement."" But it adds that no such groups are known to have threatened the inauguration so far. The report further noted that ""lone offenders"" not connected to organized groups pose the greatest potential threat because such offenders are often the most difficult to detect. The document says there have been some reports of lone offenders making threats but no indication that any of the potential threats ""have progressed past rhetoric to operational planning."" CNN's Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Security experts say trip poses threats to buildings, bridges, tunnels along route .

"(CNN) -- England coach Fabio Capello has warned his players to behave or face the risk of missing out on a trip to the World Cup finals. John Terry has already been stripped of the captaincy following tabloid allegations of his marital infidelity with the former partner of ex-Chelsea teammate Wayne Bridge. And another Chelsea player, Ashley Cole, has been at the eye of a media storm which culminated in his pop star wife Cheryl announcing on Tuesday that she is separating from him. Capello, known as a strict disciplinarian, is expected to lay down the law to his squad ahead of next Wednesday's friendly with Egypt in London as he bids to fortify team morale for football's showpiece event in South Africa, which starts in June. ""The players have to understand what I want, if you want to stay with me,"" the Italian told reporters on Tuesday. ""It will be very important because we need to create a group. The England shirt is very important. This will be one of the most important points we will speak about. ""The World Cup is really important for me, for England and for the players. We have to stay together and compact in every moment. I think this will be my most important job, to recreate this spirit. ""After four months, we will meet the players next week and it will be a very important game for many reasons. One is also this [situation]. ""We will talk about a lot of things because four months is a long time. If you can meet the players every month it is different. We will have two days to stay together, but they are very strong days."" Terry is expected to be named in the squad to face the Africa Cup of Nations champions at Wembley next week, but Cole is out with a broken ankle so Manchester City defender Bridge is poised to deputize at left-back. Capello expects Cole to be fit for the World Cup following talks with Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti and the English Premier League leaders' medical staff. ""We hope he will be fit in two months more or less, and I think he will be ready for the World Cup,"" the 63-year-old said. Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho has claimed that he turned down the chance to become England's manager just before Capello was appointed in December 2007. The Portuguese coach told reporters ahead of Inter Milan's Champions League clash with his former club Chelsea on Wednesday night that the England role ""was not the job for me"" when he was asked to replace the sacked Steve McClaren. ""I could have been England manager. I was, at that time, maybe the proudest manager in the world because, especially for a foreign coach, to have the possibility of leading a country like England, I was the proudest man in the world,"" he said on Tuesday evening. ""I thought and thought and thought, and I was fighting with myself because one side wanted and the other side knew it was not the job for me, for my mentality, for my passion of football, for training every day. ""It was not the job for me and I decided it was not to be. It was a good decision, England chose a very good experienced manager who is doing a great job. ""And, because I love England, I hope he keeps doing very, very well and keeps having the dream and, why not, the reality of making something very, very important for your country.""","England coach Fabio Capello has warned his players to behave or miss the World Cup .

"Cristiano Ronaldo has been named in Portugal's squad for their World Cup play-off against Bosnia-Herzegovina despite objections from La Liga side Real Madrid. The 24-year-old forward faces a race to be fit for the two games on November 14 and 18 as he has battles back from an ankle injury. Medical reports confirmed he would be out of action for two more weeks and Real coach Manuel Pellegrini had said it would be ""impossible for Ronaldo to play with Portugal"" and urged Carlos Queiroz to leave him out of the squad. Ronaldo has missed the Spanish side's last eight matches after suffering an injury to his right ankle during the Champions League match with Marseille on September 30, and then aggravating it while playing for Portugal in their World Cup qualifier against Hungary on October 10. The former Manchester United star has since met with Dutch specialist Professor Niek van Dijk in Amsterdam after tests conducted by Madrid last Wednesday revealed that no improvement had been made on Ronaldo's injury since undergoing an MRI scan a week before. Van Dijk, who operated the winger's right ankle in the summer of 2008, advised Ronaldo to continue his treatment before returning for a fresh evaluation in two weeks' time. Portugal coach Queiroz revealed, however, that the injury would not stop him from naming Ronaldo in his 23-man squad and the forward admitted that not playing in South Africa would be a bitter pill to swallow. ""We have one more test left. We'll have to qualify in our next two games and I can't possibly imagine a World Cup without Portugal in it,"" Ronaldo told Real Madrid's Web site. ""We are all united to achieve this goal. I believe we can be optimistic thanks to our will and talent. It would have been easier if our run in the qualifying round had been better, but it wasn't to be."" Valencia full-back Miguel, Wolfsburg centre-back Ricardo Costa and Werder Bremen striker Hugo Almeida returned to the squad. Portugal take on Bosnia-Herzegovina in Lisbon on Saturday with the return leg in Zenica four days later. Meanwhile, Liverpool striker Fernando Torres has been left out of Spain's squad for their international friendly with Argentina.","Cristiano Ronaldo has been named in Portugal's squad for their World Cup play-off clash with Bosnia-Herzegovina .

"SELMA, Alabama -- For almost 60 years, Grace Britton Sweet has had the right to vote. She can vividly recall the day she registered. Grace Britton Sweet, center, was one of a few black Americans who had the right to vote as early as 1953. As an African-American woman living in the South, she was one of a few black Americans who had the right to cast a ballot as early as 1953. In states like Alabama, literacy tests were given as a way to bar African-Americans from voting. If a black person was unable to answer questions such as, ""If a person charged with treason denies his guilt, how many persons must testify against him before he can be convicted?"" they would be denied the right to vote. Whites were often asked far easier questions, if any at all. When Sweet went to the registrar's office and wrote ""Mrs."" before her name, the person registering her scratched it out. Sweet wrote it again, and again it was scratched out. The person accompanying Sweet optimistically told her to ""leave it alone, that's coming. Let's get you registered to vote."" In the mid-1960s, all of that changed. ""We gave the nation the Voting Rights Act here in Selma,"" says Sam Walker, the curator of the National Voters Rights Museum. ""We like to say that the people were the lowest they could go and they knew that they didn't want to be treated that way anymore,"" says Walker. ""So, they wanted to do something to change the condition that they were under, and so they set out to change those conditions by obtaining the right to vote."" In 1965, civil rights leaders organized three voting rights marches in Selma. The first, on March 7, 1965, was from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. Bob Mants was one of the organizers. He remembers how they decided who would lead the march for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  What would MLK say? » . ""They flipped coins to decide who would lead for SCLC, and Hosea [Williams] lost. So he was to lead the march,"" recalls Mants. Williams and Georgia Rep. John Lewis, who was then chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, led hundreds of civil rights marchers over the Edmund Pettus Bridge. As the marchers crossed over the bridge, which spans the Alabama River, state and local police waited on the other side in riot gear. The marchers were tear-gassed and pummeled with billy clubs. Network news cameras captured the violence that outraged much of the nation. ""People got up from their homes from all over America and just flooded into Selma. Just in a couple of days, thousands of people got up and some came regardless of race, religion, all types of backgrounds,"" remembers Walker. ""[They] came to Selma saying this is America and people in America should never be treated like this."" Bloody Sunday, as it came to be known, led to swift passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibited any state from denying any United States citizen the right to vote based on race. ""Because of the media coverage of [Bloody Sunday], it infuriated people,"" Mants says. ""There were people in this country that did not know there were black people in the South who were disenfranchised."" Bloody Sunday was more than just a singular event, and Walker and Mants say President-elect Barack Obama has benefited from the sacrifices made by the civil rights marchers they call ""foot soldiers."" ""We'd be foolish and naive to think that the election of Barack Obama as president of the United States is an end,"" cautions Mants. ""There are still some other basic and fundamental issues that this country has to deal with ... and one of the major concerns is the distribution of wealth."" Mants says that even though there are ""black faces in high places,"" he hopes to see the quality of life improve for more Americans. Both men have no doubt that Obama's moment in history wouldn't have happened without the bloody march in Selma more than four decades earlier. Today, the National Voters Rights Museum sits just yards from the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Inside the door to the left is a wall of notes left by many of the people who marched that day. Some 43 years later, Mants says the lifelong struggle was worth it. But did he ever think he would see an African-American president in his lifetime? ""Yes, because there are some of us who kept our eyes on the prize, who never turned back, and [believed] that we shall overcome,"" Mants says. ""There's nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come."" Longtime voter Grace Britton Sweet thinks so, too. ""[Obama] is one of the greatest things to ever happen,"" she gushes. She plans to have a front-row seat for Obama's inauguration when she watches the swearing-in from her living room with her prayer group. Forget the crowds, Sweet says, ""I can see it better on my TV."" This is one event she would rather see in its entirety than in person.","Few African-Americans living in Deep South were allowed to vote before 1965 .

"(CNN) -- South Korea striker Lee Dong-Gook will go to the World Cup even though he may not be fit for his country's opening game in South Africa. The 32-year-old missed Sunday's 1-0 defeat by Belarus with a hamstring injury and will also sit out Thursday's final warm-up match against Spain. But he was named in coach Huh Jung-Moo's final 23-man squad with the hope of being ready to play in the republic's second Group B game against Argentina on June 17, five days after the opener against Greece. ""The team's medical and physical training staff agreed that he would be able to play from the second game. He won't have any trouble playing in the second and third match,"" Huh told the Yonhap news agency. Lee went to the 1998 World Cup as a 19-year-old, but missed out as South Korea co-hosted the 2002 event with Japan and was injured just before the 2006 finals in Germany.

Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-Sung is captain in a squad that contains plenty of experience, including 33-year-old fullback Lee Young-Pyo -- who in 2008 was the seventh South Korean to win 100 international caps. Veteran goalkeeper Lee Woon-Jae, 37, will go to his fourth World Cup while 2002 goalscoring hero Ahn Jung-Hwan, 34, will go to his third. Winger Seol Ki-Hyeon, who played at the 2002 and 2006 World Cups, missed out on the initial 30-man squad as he is still recovering from a knee injury. Japan midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura was named in coach Takeshi Okada's 23-man squad despite missing Sunday's 2-1 friendly defeat by England with an ankle injury. The 31-year-old former Celtic and Espanyol player will go to his second World Cup, having missed out at home in 2002 after suffering a knee injury in the second-to-last warm-up match. Blog: Who will be the World Cup's best player? Okada retained his four Europe-based players -- CSKA Moscow's Keisuke Honda, Wolfsburg's Makoto Hasebe, Daisuke Matsui of Grenoble and Catania's Takayuki Morimoto -- while midfielder Junichi Inamoto was also picked following his return home from France this season. Veteran goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi also kept his place after being called into the preliminary squad for the first time in 18 months. Australia coach Pim Verbeek blamed Rhys Williams' club boss after the young defender missed out on his final 23-man World Cup squad. Verbeek said the 21-year-old was not fit enough after playing through the season with painkilling injections to help a pelvic problem, despite the Dutchman having warned manager Gordon Strachan of English second division side Middlesbrough of the dangers. ""He's not free to play and his recovery is not quick enough to make it. I'm disappointed he will not be in the final 23,"" said Verbeek, who will stand down after the finals. Galatasaray's Harry Kewell was picked despite his long-term groin problem, and is one of only three strikers alongside Josh Kennedy and Ukraine-born Nikita Rukavytsya. Young midfielder Tommy Oar was dropped along with Shane Lowry, James Holland and goalkeeper Eugene Galekovic.

"(CNN) -- Serie A champions Inter Milan have completed the signing of striker Goran Pandev on a deal until 2014. Pandev was a free agent after winning his legal battle against Lazio to be released from his contract. A return to Inter -- where he spent three years without making a senior appearance earlier in his career -- always appeared likely to be his next move and the Nerazzurri confirmed the deal on Monday. The Macedonia international has penned a four-and-a-half-year deal and is excited about linking up with Jose Mourinho's side. He told the club's official Web site: ""I am really very happy. My dream was always to remain at Inter, but things have gone well nevertheless. I grew, I became a man, a real player and today I am happy to be here."" Pandev joins an Inter squad eight points clear at the top in Italy, although closest challengers AC Milan have a game in hand. He added: ""The year has started very well for me. Now we need to win the Scudetto and do well in the Champions League so we can all be happy. ""I hope to contribute a lot, but it is especially important to win, then who gets the goals is a side issue."" Lazio were ordered to release Pandev from his contract by the Lega Calcio just before Christmas. He had been at Lazio since 2004 and quickly became a fans' favourite at the Stadio Olimpico. However, matters turned sour last summer when Lazio revealed they would not accept a bid of less than 19 million euros for Pandev after he filed a transfer request. The 26-year-old was branded a ""rebel"" by club president Claudio Lotito and frozen out of the squad, as well as being forced to train separately from his former team-mates. He was linked with several clubs across Europe, including Liverpool, but opted to remain in Italy.","Serie A champions Inter Milan have completed the signing of striker Goran Pandev .

"(CNN) -- England striker Wayne Rooney scored his 100th English Premier League goal to help Manchester United keep their title hopes alive with a stunning 3-1 win at rivals Arsenal. The in-form Rooney, who had scored 22 goals in all competitions this season prior to the match -- including four against Hull City last weekend -- achieved the milestone with United's second goal, a brilliant finish following a devastating counter-attack. United, who won by the same scoreline at the Emirates in last year's Champions League semifinal, needed a victory to keep pace with Chelsea at the top of the table -- and they took a 33rd-minute lead with a moment of skill from Portuguese winger Nani. Nani, who has failed to establish himself as a regular during his time at Old Trafford, flicked the ball past Arsenal's Gael Clichy and Samir Nasir on the right wing, before producing a delicate lob that goalkeeper Manuel Almunia could only palm into his own net. And United doubled their lead four minutes later when Nani out-stripped the Arsenal defence on the break and Rooney -- who had started the move -- ran half the length of the pitch to be on hand in support to fire past Almunia. Arsenal continued to press forward looking for a way back into the match, but once again they were caught on the break as this time Korean Ji-Sung Park burst through a huge gap in the home defence to slide home the decisive third goal early in the second half. United had chances to increase their advantage with both Rooney and Nani close to adding a fouth, but it was Arsenal who claimed a late consolation when Thomas Vermaelen's shot found the net after taking a deflection off Jonny Evans. ""That was a great performance by us. We played really well,"" United manager Sir Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports. ""This is the time of the season we really need to kick on -- and it was an impressive result. We were sharp and incisive and could have scored more. ""But we are still behind Chelsea and I hope that Arsenal go there and batter them next Sunday!"" The result means United remain a point behind Chelsea at the top of the table, although the London side have a game in hand -- at Hull on Tuesday. Arsenal are now five points behind Chelsea in third place having played a game more and, if Chelsea win in midweek, that gap will increase to eight points ahead of the two sides meeting at Stamford Bridge next Sunday. It proved a good day for Manchester as United's rivals City maintained their push for a Champions League place with a comfortable 2-0 home win over crisis-club Portsmouth. Bottom-of-the-table Portsmouth -- who agreed to sell defender Younes Kaboul to Tottenham this weekend just so the wage bill could be paid -- went behind when Emmanuel Adebayor fired City ahead with his first goal since his traumatic experience with Togo at the Africa Cup of Nations in Angola. And City made the points safe on the stroke of half-time when Vincent Kompany powered a header past goalkeeper David James from Martin Petrov's corner.","England striker Wayne Rooney scores his 100th Premier League goal on Sunday .

"(CNN)  -- England captain John Terry shrugged off lurid allegations about his private life to score the winning goal as Chelsea claimed a vital 2-1 victory at Burnley to go four points clear in the Premier League. Terry unsuccessfully failed with a High Court injunction to prevent newspapers publishing the revelations about an alleged affair with the former girlfriend of ex-teammate Wayne Bridge. There were doubts that Terry would even play at Turf Moor, but with the clock counting down and the scores tied 1-1, he came up for a corner and headed an 82nd minute winner. The win takes Chelsea four points clear of Manchester United, who play third-placed Arsenal in a vital match in the title race at the Emirates on Sunday. ""It was a very difficult game,"" Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti told ESPN before praising his captain. ""He's a fantastic player. Every game, he plays very well. ""He's an important player for us. All of Chelsea support him."" Nicolas Anelka had given Chelsea a 27th-minute lead with his sixth goal in six games, but the relegation battlers equalized in the 50th minute as Steven Fletcher foxed defender Alex before shooting past Petr Cech. Earlier, the race for the fourth Champions League place tightened up as Tottenham were held 1-1 at Birmingham. Jermaie Defoe looked to have given Spurs three points until Liam Ridgewell's injury-time equalizer. But their rivals for fourth, Liverpool and Aston Villa, both won to keep up the pressure. Liverpool beat Bolton 2-0 to stay a point adrift of Spurs in fifth while Villa, who have a game in hand, are two points behind after defeating Fulham by the same scoreline in a match where Gabriel Agbonlahor scored both goals. In the tight relegation battle, second from bottom Hull failed to climb out of the relegation zone after a 2-2 home draw with fellow strugglers Wolves. In-form Everton made it four league wins from five with a 1-0 victory away to Wigan while Blackburn Rovers and West Ham shared the points in a goalless draw at Upton Park.","John Terry scores winning goal for Chelsea in a 2-1 win at Burnley .

"(CNN) -- On a crisp Halloween night, icicle lights and Santa Clauses mingled with ghosts and jack-o'-lanterns in a Washington, Illinois, neighborhood. The community is helping a family squeeze in a little extra holiday cheer with their young son. Doctors say 2-year-old Dax Locke is losing his fight with acute myeloid leukemia and may only have weeks to live, so parents Julie and Austin Locke put Christmas lights up outside their home for the little boy, who loves glowing things. Dax opens presents each day under a tree that's already been up for several weeks. ""We don't have much time left with Dax, don't know if he will make it to Christmas, so we wanted to have Christmas early,"" Julie Locke told local news station WMBD. Neighbor and friend Trish Hurtgen says she and her husband were inspired by the family's efforts, so they put up their own lights and encouraged neighbors to do the same. Soon, the entire block was lit up with Christmas lights. They also planned a special surprise for the family. While the Lockes traveled to Chicago's Shedd Aquarium for a special trip with Dax, the neighborhood banded together to decorate a huge tree in the family's yard so the Lockes could be delighted when they returned just after Halloween. From there, she and other neighbors have helped encourage people to show silent support for the family by putting up Christmas lights at home and around the community. The effort, called Decorate for Dax, has its own Web site with space for people everywhere to send pictures and see others' displays. Hurtgen calls the Lockes a ""family of courage"" that she found inspirational, and she wanted to help if she could. ""This is a family who stayed united and formed a team to help Dax,"" Hurtgen said. ""They gave everything they had. We're trying to do the same thing."" Dax has spent past holidays at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, but this year, he's at home. Save for receiving palliative radiation to improve his quality of life, he is off cancer treatments. Hurtgen says Dax enjoys going for car rides and seeing the lights on around him. The family plans to make a book out of photos that people send so Dax will be able to see all the lights for Christmas if he's too sick to go outside. iReporter Cindy Miller lives in the area and got involved in local neighborhood decorating projects. She posted a video on CNN iReport to raise awareness of the Decorate for Dax project. She narrated a drive through Dax's neighborhood shortly after Halloween, and many houses were illuminated. Take a cruise through Dax's brightened neighborhood . During one project, locals put up lights and luminarias at a local park. Miller sent photos and video of the illuminated areas she spotted, including a red, white and green sign with Dax's name in bright lights. Miller said her heart was warmed by all the work the community put into the decorations, and she was overjoyed to see Dax out with the family amid all the people helping to decorate. ""I sobbed like a baby, but was overjoyed at the show of support for this family who may not have their baby here at Christmastime. It's unusual to see Christmas lights up so early, but this year, there's a good reason."" Hurtgen says she's been surprised by how Decorate for Dax has taken off. Submissions have come from all over the United States and in far-flung countries like Australia and Germany. ""I don't know how the word is getting out,"" Hurtgen said. Hurtgen added that one woman even wrote in to say that her husband, stationed in Afghanistan, was working with fellow troops to photograph a lights display for Dax. Send photos of decorations to CNN . Some of the colorful and bright displays she's seen include big signs with Dax's name on them and holiday-themed shapes and figurines. Other displays are more humble, like a message from another boy in a hospital and a makeshift tribute inside a tiny apartment. ""It doesn't have to be big, just your way of showing support."" The Lockes aren't the only family hosting an early Christmas. Diana Biorkman of South Lyon, Michigan, told CNN affiliate WDIV that her son, Noah, is dying of a Stage 4 neuroblastoma, which is a type of cancer that forms in nerve tissue. Noah loves opening mail, so the family asked people to send him a Christmas card. Word got out, and he started getting gifts and cards from strangers. The family recently picked up a carload of mail and toys. Detroit Tigers baseball player Brandon Inge even sent a card and stopped over for a ""play date"" that included building a snow fort with Noah. Hurtgen says the silent show of support works well for their community because Dax needs his rest and the family needs their privacy. Perhaps, she said, people will see this odd display of early lights and wonder what is going on. Maybe they'll also pause for a moment to think about Dax and about what they can do to help. The family is asking people to make donations to St. Jude. ""That's what Christmas is about, giving and not needing to get in return."" Everyone is holding out hopes Dax will make it to Christmas. ""Christmas would be a miracle. We're praying for a big miracle.""","Neighbors put up decorations early for 2-year-old Dax Locke .

"(CNN) -- Paraguay coach Gerardo Martino has named Argentina-born striker Lucas Barrios in his 23-man squad for the World Cup in South Africa. Barrios, who has a Paraguayan mother, was given citizenship in April and scored in World Cup warm-up matches against the Republic of Ireland and the Ivory Coast. The 25-year-old, who netted 19 goals for German club Borussia Dortmund this season, will be vying for a starting place with clubmate Nelson Valdez, Roque Santa Cruz of English side Manchester City, Benfica's in-form Oscar Cardozo, Edgar Benitez of Mexico's Pachuca and Libertad's Rodolfo Gamarra. Martino dropped Argentina-based Eduardo Ledesma, Marcos Caceres, Marcelo Estigarribia and Jorge Achucarro from his preliminary 30-man selection, along with midfielders Sergio Aquino and Osvaldo Martinez and defender Julio Manzur. Blog: The World Cup's missing men . Striker Salvador Cabanas was omitted from the initial squad despite being nearly recovered from head wounds after being shot in a bar in Mexico City in January. Mexico coach Javier Aguirre dropped young Barcelona midfielder Jonathan Santos from his final 23-man World Cup squad along with home-based defenders Juan Carlos Valenzuela and Adrian Aldrete. The 20-year-old has won five caps since making his debut last September, and played the whole match as Mexico thrashed Gambia 5-1 on Sunday. His father Geraldo, a Brazilian also known as Zizinho who played for Mexican clubs in the 1980s, said his son would now turn his back on the national team. ""Jonathan will not play for Mexico anymore,"" he told Mexican television network Televisa. ""I love Mexico, I adore it, it is my country even though I am Brazilian but they cannot hurt him this way."" Blog: Who will be the World Cup's best player? Aguirre's decision leaves the squad with just four specialist midfielders: Jonathan's older brother Giovani, Andres Guardado, Gerrardo Torrado and Israel Castro. Aguirre picked nine defenders, including captain Rafael Marquez of Barcelona, who can also play in midfield. Seven strikers were selected, including 21-year-old Carlos Vela and 37-year-old Cuauhtemoc Blanco, who came out of international retirement last April when Aguirre returned for his second spell in charge to help Mexico qualify. Striker Miguel Sabah, who scored a late winner in a qualifier against the U.S. last August, was ruled out of Aguirre's earlier provisional squad by injury. Argentina coach Diego Maradona surprisingly named defender Ariel Garce in his final 23-man squad for South Africa. The 30-year-old, who plays for Argentine club Colon, was recalled for the 4-0 friendly win over Haiti on May 5 for the first time since winning his first two caps in 2003. Garce kept his place ahead of 33-cap Fabricio Coloccini, who missed out along with fellow defender Juan Manuel Insaurralde, Napoli striker Ezequiel Lavezzi and midfielders Jose Sosa, Juan Mercier, Jesus Datolo and Sebastian Blanco. Blog: Is Messi better than Maradona? Coloccini's Newcastle teammate Jonas Gutierrez made the cut despite playing in the English second division this season, with Liverpool's Maxi Rodriguez vying with him for a wing place. Veteran striker Martin Palermo, 36, has the chance to play at his first World Cup, being one of five Argentina-based players selected by the 1986 title-winner Maradona. Maradona had earlier omitted Inter Milan stars Javier Zanetti and Esteban Cambiasso from his 30-man preliminary squad. The 36-year-old Zanetti, Argentina's most-capped player, was controversially axed by Jose Pekerman for the 2006 World Cup but then brought back by his successor Alfio Basile and retained by Maradona for the 2010 qualifiers -- though he lost the team captaincy to Javier Mascherano. He was a key figure in Inter's charge to a hat-trick of trophies this season, having won the Italian Cup, Serie A and Champions League. Cambiasso, who played in Germany four years ago and had a spot-kick saved in the quarterfinal penalty shootout defeat to the hosts, has not been called up since Maradona took charge despite establishing himself as one of the best defensive midfielders in Europe. Become a CNN Super Fan: Why your country needs you! Inter's Champions League final hero Diego Milito was selected despite playing a limited role in the qualifiers, and central defender Walter Samuel has the chance to feature at his second World Cup after missing out in 2006. Center-back Martin Demichelis, who helped Bayern Munich win the German league and cup titles, was rewarded for his fine form this season. England-based Mascherano and Carlos Tevez were also included, but Maradona omitted Barcelona defender Gabriel Milito and Real Madrid midfielder Fernando Gago. Brazil coach Dunga ended the World Cup dreams of Ronaldinho and Adriano by omitting the duo from his final 23-man squad for the World Cup in South Africa. The 30-year-old Ronaldinho, a two-time world player of the year, misses out for the second tournament in a row despite returning to form this season with Italian club AC Milan. Former Inter Milan striker Adriano raised his profile by returning home to play with Flamengo following well-documented personal problems, but has failed to impress Dunga. ""Adriano was given several opportunities,"" the 1994 World Cup winner said. ""There was a moment when we made a decision about the group. The group always welcomed Adriano, but there is a moment when reason talks louder than the heart."" Ronaldinho's Milan teammate Alexandre Pato also missed out, along with highly-rated Santos teenager Neymar, but Germany-based striker Grafite was included at the age of 31 after his fine form for deposed Bundesliga champions Wolfsburg. United States coach Bob Bradley included Mexico-based striker Herculez Gomez and midfielder Jose Torres in his final 23-man squad. Veteran striker Eddie Johnson missed out on his second World Cup after being cut from the 30-strong preliminary selection along with fellow forward Brian Ching, defenders Chad Marshall and Heath Pearce plus midfielders Alejandro Bedoya, Sacha Kljestan and Robbie Rogers. Bradley's squad, which includes his son Michael, features 15 players who have never been to a World Cup alongside two-time veterans Steve Cherundolo, Landon Donovan and Marcus DaBeasley. Defender Oguchi Onyewu and midfielder Stuart Holden are in the squad despite recent long-term injury absences. Gomez and Robbie Findley did not play in any of the qualifiers -- and neither did their fellow forward Edson Buddle, who won his first cap since 2003 in the 4-2 friendly defeat by the Czech Republic on May 25. Chile coach Marcelo Bielsa made defender Roberto Cereceda the unlucky man to miss out on the World Cup after Marco Estrada recovered from injury. Having earlier dropped striker Hector Mancilla of Mexican side Toluca to whittle his squad down to 24, Bielsa dispensed with Colo Colo's Cereceda -- who had been brought in as cover. Union Espanola's Luis Marin was given the third goalkeeping place behind captain Claudio Bravo of Real Sociedad and Miguel Pinto. Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez axed Catania striker Jorge Martinez, River Plate midfielder Jorge Rodriguez and Nacional winger Alvaro Gonzalez from his provisonal 26-man squad. He had earlier omitted Cristian Rodriguez, with the Porto winger set to start a two-game ban after his red card in the final qualifier. Penarol's Egidio Arevalo-Rios and Defensor Sporting goalkeeper Martin Silva were the only home-based players named in the final 23. Like Dunga, Honduras coach Reinaldo Rueda took the unusual step of naming his 23-man squad well ahead of the June 1 deadline, plus seven reserves. Key striker Carlos Costly is one of the standby players after being ruled out for four weeks with a foot injury, with his place taken by Georgie Welcome -- who in 2008 was the first Honduran to make his international debut while playing for a second-division side. England-based Wilson Palacios, Hendry Thomas and Maynor Figueroa are named along with Italy-based forward David Suazo and 36-year-old Carlos Pavon, who is set to win his 100th cap.","Argentina-born striker Lucas Barrios named in Paraguay's 23-man World Cup squad .

"(CNN) -- There are 3,626 songs in my music library. Some are played every day, others just a few times a year. There are songs that remind me of relationships I've royally screwed up (Hoobastank's ""The Reason"") and a few on my iPhone that were clearly DWIs -- downloaded while intoxicated (think Huey Lewis and the News, circa 1985). But despite the wide range of emotions triggered by my 3,626 songs, I typically don't have a problem listening to any of them at any given time. Except for four: ""Run It,"" ""Forever,"" ""With You"" and ""Kiss Kiss."" Haven't played them since last winter. For those of you a little slow on the pop culture uptake, these are all songs by Chris Brown, the R&B singer who back in February assaulted his then-girlfriend, singer Rihanna, was sentenced to 180 days of community service, and now, eight months later, wants us to download his new music. And forgive him. ""Honestly, I would just like to get past it,"" Brown recently told Rolling Stone. ""At the end of the day, I'm sorry for what I did, whatever it is."" This week, Brown headlines his first concert since the assault, the next step in revitalizing his image. As a one-time fan, there's a part of me that would like to get back to playing his music and get back to the party. But the last three words of that sentence just won't let me do it. ""Whatever it is"" doesn't sound like the words of a man who has done some serious soul searching. Rather, ""whatever it is"" sounds like the words of a man trained by his lawyers or marketing team to offer up a public admission of wrongdoing while avoiding linking his name to unpleasant phrases such as ""domestic violence"" and ""physical assault."" It's the same avoidance we saw during his interview with CNN's Larry King. The reason why I am having a tough time moving on -- and thus playing Brown's music again -- is because he doesn't appear willing to say exactly what we're supposed to be moving on from. He's trying to speak up while remaining silent, which makes me wonder if he's sorry for what he did, or sorry he got caught. I'm not saying Brown is a terrible person. I'm not saying he doesn't still love Rihanna. And I'm certainly am not trying to dictate when someone should be forgiven. But I am having a hard time hearing his voice over a dance beat right now. And I am having difficulties singing along to lyrics such as ""I won't let you fall girl"" knowing that's not all together true. We're all human, capable of making some terrible mistakes. I certainly have done some things I am not proud of and likely will do more things that fall short of being admirable. But when the nation's domestic violence 24-hour hot lines are receiving 14 calls a minute, ""whatever it is"" just rubs me the wrong way. Any PR guru will tell you it's nice to have the public forgive your sins, but it's even better to have them forget. Forgetting starts with redirecting the conversation and distancing yourself from the controversy, and it appears that is exactly what Brown is trying to do. He doesn't want to be thought of as a perpetrator. He doesn't want to be linked to criminal behavior. He just wants to move on. I do, too. But reality won't let me. Multiple studies show that nearly 2 million women are victims of domestic violence annually, and with the added tension fueled by a hurting economy, some crisis centers are seeing an increase of cases. I can remember women in my neighborhood, and even in my own family, trying to cover up bruises they believed they deserved for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. ""He's a good man,"" is what they would say to each other, as if it was encouragement. And we all know this isn't just an issue that affects the everyday family. It was just a year ago this week the mother, brother and 7-year-old nephew of Jennifer Hudson were killed, allegedly by her sister's estranged husband. Prosecutors believe he shot them in a jealous rage because Hudson's sister was dating someone else. Also a year ago this month, Soul Train creator Don Cornelius was arrested on charges of domestic violence. This fall, actor Tom Sizemore was arrested on charges of domestic violence -- again. It's an ongoing problem, and yet culturally it doesn't feel that way. Culturally it feels as if we treat it like a private matter, an aspect of the couple's relationship that should be determined by the two of them. Culturally, it doesn't even feel like it's a crime, with generations being spoon fed images of Ricky Ricardo spanking Lucy or hearing Ralph Kramden threaten to knock Alice to the moon. When the incident first occurred, some fans assumed Rihanna did something and thus deserved the assault, underscoring the sentiment that it's less of a crime and more of a fight between lovers. To his credit, Brown is donating a portion of the proceeds from the fan appreciation tour he is doing next month to a Los Angeles, California, based nonprofit that helps victims of domestic violence. A nice gesture that, unfortunately, is somewhat undermined by the bravado spewing from his latest single, ""I'll Transform Ya,"" which brags about him being a great catch. Talk about disconnects. I guess this is why there are 3,626 songs in my music library and not 3,622. I haven't deleted the four songs by Brown from my music library because there's a part of me that understands this dialogue is way bigger than the incident that surrounds a 20-year-old kid. Hopefully Brown really is a changed person, who, over time, will continue to use his fame to bring public awareness to the dangers of domestic violence. There's a part of me that wants to play his music again, rejoin the party, and yeah, move on. Just not yet. Right now I still have the images of a battered Rihanna in my head, so you'll have to forgive me if I don't feel like dancing to the songs of the person who did it. ""Whatever it is"" he did.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson says he can't listen to the Chris Brown songs in his music library -- yet .

"(CNN) -- A soldier suspected of fatally shooting 12 and wounding 31 at Fort Hood in Texas on Thursday is not dead as previously reported by the military, the base's commander said Thursday evening. A civilian officer who was wounded in the incident shot the suspect, who is ""in custody and in stable condition,"" Army Lt. Gen. Robert Cone told reporters. ""Preliminary reports indicate there was a single shooter that was shot multiple times at the scene,"" Cone said at a news conference. ""However, he was not killed as previously reported."" The suspect, identified as Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, opened fire at a military processing center at Fort Hood around 1:30 p.m., Cone said. Three others initially taken into custody for interviews have been released, Cone said. Hasan, 39, is a graduate of Virginia Tech and a psychiatrist licensed in Virginia who was practicing at Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood, according to military and professional records. Previously, he worked at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. A federal official said Hasan is a U.S. citizen of Jordanian descent. Military documents show that Hasan was born in Virginia and was never deployed outside the United States. In a statement released Thursday, Hasan's cousin, Nader Hasan, said his family is ""filled with grief for the families of today's victims."" ""Our family loves America. We are proud of our country, and saddened by today's tragedy,"" the statement said. ""Because this situation is still unfolding, we have nothing else that we are able to share with you at this time."" Hasan was scheduled to be deployed to Iraq ""and appeared to be upset about that,"" Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said. ""I think that there is a lot of investigation going on now into his background and what he was doing that was not known before,"" Hutchison said. Hutchison said she was told that the soldiers at the readiness facility ""were filling out paper processing to go to Iraq or Afghanistan,"" according to CNN affiliate KXAN in Austin, Texas. The readiness center is one of the last stops before soldiers deploy. It is also one of the first places a soldier goes upon returning to the United States. The base reopened Thursday night after being under lockdown for more than five hours. At a news conference earlier in the day, Cone said at least 10 of the dead were soldiers. The shooter had two weapons, both handguns, Cone said. iReport.com: Are you there? Send pics, video . A witness in a building adjacent to where the shooting happened said soldiers were cutting up their uniforms into homemade bandages as the wounded were brought into the building. ""It was total chaos,"" the witness said. Cone said a graduation ceremony was being held in an auditorium just 50 meters from where the shooting took place. ""Thanks to the quick reaction of several soldiers, they were able to close off the doors to that auditorium where there were some 600 people inside,"" he said. Peggy McCarty of Missouri told CNN affiliate KSHB that her daughter, Keara Bono, was among Thursday's wounded. She said she briefly spoke to Bono, who told her she had been shot in her left shoulder but was doing well. ""She's being deployed to Iraq on December 7,"" McCarty said. ""I thought I was more worried about her going over to Iraq than here, just doing training in Texas. She just got there yesterday."" A woman who lives on base, about eight blocks from the shooting, said she and her daughter were at home when her husband called and told them to stay inside. ""And I asked him why, what was going on. He said that there was a shooting,"" said the woman, Nicole, who asked that her last name not be used. She said her husband called her back about 20 minutes later and told her to go upstairs, stay away from doors and windows and keep the doors locked. ""It's just been crazy,"" she said. ""Sirens everywhere."" A soldier who asked not to be identified told CNN that an e-mail went out to all base personnel instructing them not to speak to the media. President Obama called the shootings ""tragic"" and ""a horrific outburst of violence."" He expressed his condolences for the shooting victims. ""These are men and women who have made the selfless and courageous decision to risk, and at times give, their lives to protect the rest of us on a daily basis,"" Obama said. ""It's difficult enough when we lose these brave Americans in battles overseas. It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an Army base on American soil."" Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple, Texas, posted an online appeal for blood as it began receving victims. ""Due to the recent events on Fort Hood, we are in URGENT need of ALL blood types,"" it said. Fort Hood, with about 40,000 troops, is home to the Army's 1st Cavalry Division and elements of the 4th Infantry Division, as well as the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 13th Corps Support Command. It is located near Killeen, Texas. The headquarters unit and three brigades of the 1st Cavalry are currently deployed in Iraq. At least 25,000 people are at Fort Hood on any given day, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon said. Fort Hood is home to the Warrior Combat Stress Reset Program, which is designed to help soldiers overcome combat stress issues. In June, Fort Hood's commander, Lt. Gen. Rick Lynch, told CNN that he was trying to ease the kind of stresses soldiers face. He has pushed for soldiers working a day schedule to return home for dinner by 6 p.m., and required his personal authorization for anyone working weekends. At the time, two soldiers stationed there had committed suicide in 2009 -- a rate well below those of other posts. Nearby Killeen was the scene of one of the most deadly shootings in American history 18 years ago when George Hennard crashed his truck into a Luby's Cafeteria and began shooting, killing 23 people and wounding 20. Hennard's spree lasted 14 minutes. He eventually took his own life.","Suspect in shootings wounded but alive, Army official says .

"(CNN)  -- It was like Mary Pipher was on a runaway train of success. She had multiple best-selling books and was much in demand as a therapist and an inspirational speaker. And at one point in 2002, she felt like she had given all she could give, and she suffered a meltdown. She detailed the struggles in her life and her recovery in her latest book, ""Seeking Peace: Chronicles of the Worst Buddhist in the World."" And in the wake of that book, she is sounding an alarm about danger of being a joyless ""constant working machine."" ""If you ask anyone how they've been any more, they always say, 'busy,' "" Pipher said. ""I'm just stubborn enough that sometimes I say, 'You know, it's been really slow for me lately,' just to see people's shocked looks, because nobody in America ever says that anymore.""

Now that she has slowed down, she's noticed how so many adults are living at a fast pace despite their feelings of being burdened, anxious and confused. She also fears that her too-busy country has developed what she calls ""a culture of anhedonia,"" or the lack of ability to feel pleasure and joy. ""People just are not laughing as much,"" Pipher said, adding that she rarely hears anyone walking around singing or whistling, like she did growing up. The psychologist says many people fault themselves for being too busy and think they just have to grab more control of their lives. Women put too many expectations on themselves: having a career, being physically fit, being in good relationships with family and friends, reading good literature, doing community work, recycling and buying green, and being involved in some sort of spiritual quest. And when they fail to accomplish all that in one day, she said, ""they go to sleep thinking, 'I didn't get done what I needed to, and somehow that is my fault.' "" Men are also heading down the path of feeling like a failure, as more of them share the ""second shift"" work of child care, cooking and cleaning at home. But the workplace hasn't shifted much to accommodate men who are more involved in their families, Pipher says. People's efforts to squeeze so much more work into the unchanging number of hours in a day has caused them to abandon the mammalian rhythms that ""we've operated on since the beginning of the human race."" Breaking those natural rhythms, Pipher says, leads people to avoid eye contact as they tell themselves it might distract them from the busy and important work that they've got to rush to do. Also, moving too fast makes it difficult to see anything that isn't moving at the same speed, again leading to people not seeing each other. ""That's got to be some kind of enormous human tragedy on a cultural level,"" she noted. ""Our time famine is actually diminishing the quality of the human experience in a very serious way."" Our too-frenetic lives also dulls our senses, she says, leading us to ""lose all capacity for joy, because joy comes from actually appreciating and being in the senses and being in the body."" Pipher realizes that most people don't have the ability or the money to take an extended leave, like she did for about three months. But she says there are other ways they can slow down. The author says she has become a ""seeker of moments"": those times when you stop in your tracks and really pay attention to something beautiful or feel a connection to another person. She suggests ways others can capture such moments: . • Take part in any daily practice that allows for stillness and quiet, such as meditation, sitting and drinking a cup of tea, stopping to watch a sunset or just lying in bed and being aware of your breathing for five minutes every morning before getting up. • Make a gratitude list at the end of the day to remind you where there was joy, or something spontaneous or fun during the day. • Choose to make human connections by looking directly into the eyes of the barista taking your latte order, your coworker or your child's teacher or day care provider. • Set aside an area in your home -- a room or even a chair -- that is the quiet or calm spot. And any member of the family can go there and be undisturbed while they ""deal with their own inner architecture for a little while."" • Turn off machines and live as close as possible to olden times by walking, talking or cooking with others. • Interact with pets. ""Dogs and cats move at the same speed in 2010 as they did in 1910,"" so there is a calmness in being with them, and they don't care if you're a high achiever or successful or well-paid.","Best-selling author Mary Pipher: People work so much they miss joy, other people .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- While California's Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld a ban on same-sex marriages that voters voters passed in November, the fight will undoubtedly go forward. Four states -- Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and Iowa -- currently allow same-sex marriages. The ruling by the court allows about 18,000 same-sex marriages performed before the ban to remain valid. The decision was met with chants of ""shame on you"" from a crowd of about 1,000 people gathered outside the court building in San Francisco on Tuesday. Proposition 8 passed in the 2008 general election with about 52.5 percent of the vote. California had been issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples since the state Supreme Court ruled in May 2008 that the unions were legal. iReport.com: Couples' thoughts on Prop 8? But the question now remains whether gay rights activists across the country will take their fight -- despite the California ruling -- to state courts, push for ballot initiatives or simply pressure state politicians to move legislation. Currently, four states -- Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and Iowa -- approved of same-sex marriages. Vermont's legislature passed a law making same-sex marriages legal that will take effect in September. New Hampshire and Rhode Island remain the New England states that have not approved the marriages into law. Most recently, on May 6, same-sex marriage became legal in Maine when Democratic Gov. John Baldacci signed a bill less than an hour after the state Legislature approved it. ""I have come to believe that this is a question of fairness and of equal protection under the law and that a civil union is not equal to civil marriage,"" he said in a statement. But he raised the possibility that the residents of the state would overturn the law. ""Just as the Maine Constitution demands that all people are treated equally under the law, it also guarantees that the ultimate political power in the state belongs to the people."" The fight for same-sex marriage in New Hampshire, meanwhile, has hit a roadblock. The House and Senate have approved allowing gay couples to marry. But Gov. John Lynch, a three-term Democrat, said last week that he would sign a same-sex marriage bill only if it provides ""the strongest and clearest protections for religious institutions and associations, and for the individuals working with such institutions."" Lynch said that any such measure needs to ""make clear that [clergy and other religious officials] cannot be forced to act in ways that violate their deeply held religious principles."" On Wednesday, the House fell two votes short of approving Lynch's language, 186-188. The chamber voted to send the legislation to a committee to be considered further. Others state have implemented same-sex marriages.  Interactive: States that allow same-sex unions » . In April, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled unanimously that it is illegal to discriminate against same-sex couples by denying them the right to marry. The first gay marriages in the state took place April 27. The District of Columbia voted May 5 to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere, though it does not itself give marriage licenses to same-sex couples. But that measure faces a potentially large hurdle: being sent to Congress for a review and vote, setting up what would amount to a straight up-or-down vote on same-sex marriage. Because Washington is not a state, its legislation must pass congressional muster. Some measures approved by overwhelmingly Democratic Washington voters, including a restrictive gun law and a proposal decriminalizing medical marijuana use, have been vetoed by Congress in recent years. In New York, Gov. David Paterson introduced legislation in April to make same-sex marriage legal. ""The time has come to act. The time has come for leadership. The time has come to bring marriage equality to the state of New York,"" the Democratic governor said. The legislation would allow same-sex couples in the state to enter into civil marriages and enjoy the same rights afforded to heterosexual married couples. A similar bill died in the state Senate in 2007. Gay rights advocates in nearby New Jersey have said they believe that the state could be the next to pass same-sex marriage into law. Although the state already recognizes civil unions for gays and lesbians, its legislature will have to take up the issue. Meanwhile, recent CNN polling has shown that a slim majority of Americans are against legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Fifty-four percent of Americans questioned in an April 23-26 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll said that marriages between gay or lesbian couples should not be recognized as valid, but 44 percent said they should be considered legal. But there was a large gap between the opinions of younger and older people, with younger people far more likely to approve of gay marriage. Nearly six in 10 people ages 18 to 34 said same-sex marriages should be legal. Just over four in 10 people ages 35 to 49 agreed, and the number was similar for 50- to 64-year-olds. Only 24 percent of people 65 and older agreed. The survey's sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. And the marriage debate is also changing for some Republicans, who have long opposed same-sex marriages. In a speech April 17 to the conservative gay-rights group Log Cabin Republicans, Steve Schmidt -- an architect of Republican Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign -- said that allowing same-sex marriage is in line with the conservative credo of keeping government out of people's private lives. ""There is a sound conservative argument to be made for same-sex marriage,"" said Schmidt, who was McCain's campaign manager. ""I believe conservatives, more than liberals, insist that rights come with responsibilities. No other exercise of one's liberty comes with greater responsibilities than marriage. In a marriage, two people are completely responsible to and for each other."" Schmidt says he knows that his is a minority view. In the presidential campaign, McCain ran against same-sex marriage. McCain's own daughter Meghan recently said the Republican Party needs to embrace issues facing gays and lesbians -- most notably, approving of same-sex marriage. Although moderates such as Schmidt and Meghan McCain approve, opposition is coming mainly from the party's base: conservatives. And the fight among conservatives and religious groups will probably heat up as more states begin to examine marriage rights. CNN's Dana Bash, Alan Duke, Peter Hamby, Laurie Segall and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Same-sex marriage is legal in four states, mostly in New England .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The Los Angeles County coroner's office has subpoenaed medical records from 20 doctors in its investigation into actor Corey Haim's death, a coroner investigator said. Haim, who died earlier this month, obtained drugs using prescriptions written under the names of these doctors in the past year, Los Angeles County Deputy Coroner Ed Winter told CNN on Friday. California drug investigators found evidence that Haim, who fought a decades-long battle with drug abuse, used at least one fake prescription to obtain a narcotic in the months before he died, California Attorney General Jerry Brown said last week. The coroner is waiting for toxicology results before deciding if drugs were involved in the death of the 1980s teen movie actor, Winter said. Those test results are several weeks away, he said. An autopsy revealed that Haim, 38, suffered from pneumonia, an enlarged heart and water in his lungs when he collapsed at his Los Angeles home on March 10, Winter said. ""We get medical records all the time,"" Winter said. ""What's kind of unusual in this is how many doctors are involved."" Pharmacy records show the actor got thousands of potentially dangerous pills from multiple doctors in the past year, according to Brown. State investigators know that Haim obtained ""massive amounts"" of legal drugs ""in what looks to me like a questionable manner because of so many doctors,"" Brown said. ""How many people go to 10 or 15 or 20 doctors and then run around to 10, 12 and more pharmacies to go fulfill them and sometimes two different doctors in the same day?"" Brown asked. Haim did not necessarily visit all of the doctors, but the prescriptions carried their names, he said. An arrest was made last week in connection with an ""illegal and massive prescription drug ring"" connected to at least one of Haim's prescriptions, Brown said. The ring involved the use of stolen identities from doctors to order official prescription pads, he said. ""Once they get that prescription pad in the doctor's name, then they can write a prescription, or they can sell it to someone to write a prescription like Corey Haim,"" Brown said. ""Then he can go into the pharmacy and get his legal drugs illegally."" Although the actor's family said Haim had reduced his drug use to near zero, Brown said that he didn't see ""any 'zero' pill consumption."" ""If he took all the pills that our records show he was prescribed over the last year and three months, he took very damaging assaults on his body,"" Brown said. Haim's most recent prescription was filled March 5 for Vicodin, he said. ""In the weeks before that, more Vicodin, more Valium and other things,"" Brown said. ""If you go back to 2009, you're talking thousands of pills,"" he said. ""You're talking many, many doctors. I doubt if they know about each other. You're talking about many, many pharmacies."" In recent years, the actor was reunited with longtime friend and frequent co-star Corey Feldman in a reality show. ""The Two Coreys"" ran for two seasons on the A&E Network before it was canceled. Haim's most famous role was in the 1987 movie ""The Lost Boys,"" in which he also appeared with Feldman. Haim played a fresh-faced teenager whose brother becomes a vampire.","Coroner issues subpoenas for records of 20 doctors in Haim death inquiry .

"(CNN) -- The 16-year-old son of actors John Travolta and Kelly Preston died Friday morning after suffering a seizure while vacationing with his family in the Bahamas, Travolta's attorney told CNN. Jett Travolta, right, joined his father weeks ago in Paris, where John Travolta has been filming a movie. ""At this point, we know that John Travolta and Kelly Preston's only son, Jett, had a seizure at around 10 a.m. this morning,"" attorney Michael Ossi said. ""All attempts to revive him were unsuccessful."" The boy hit his head after the seizure, but the exact cause of death is not known, Ossi said. An autopsy will be conducted Monday. His body will be transferred to Ocala, Florida, for burial, he said. Jett's death ""was completely out of the blue,"" he said. ""John and Kelly are happy when their children are happy. This is the worst day of John's life.""  Watch John Travolta and son Jett in Paris » . The Travoltas also have a daughter, Ella, 8. Bahamian police said a caretaker at the West End resort where the Travoltas were vacationing found the teenager unconscious in the bathroom.

Jett's death was mourned by the staff and residents of West End, where the Travoltas were beloved members of the community, Obie Wilchcomb, former minister of tourism for the Bahamas, told CNN's Larry King. ""We in West End had admired Mr. Travolta and his wife, Kelly,"" Wilchcomb said. ""The people of the community of West End, particularly those who work at Old Bahama Bay, certainly today were in such shock, and they felt the tragedy because they had become a part of the community."" Wilchcomb said the Travoltas' love and affection for their son was apparent to those in the community.  See photos of Jett with his family » . ""Mr. Travolta spent a tremendous amount of time with his son, Jett. He never left him at home. He always brought him with him. And once you saw John Travolta, you saw his son, Jett. They were very close, very affectionate. Lots of love, you see at all times,"" Wilchcomb said. The family was on the island this weekend for a gathering of 60 family and friends who were arriving throughout the day as the tragedy unfolded, Wilchcomb said. In 1994, Travolta told People magazine that he loved fatherhood. ""I can't imagine what life would be like without Jett,"" he said. ""After he was born and cleaned up, I held him for hours while Kelly slept. When they came to take him away for various tests, I said, 'No, you can't see him today. You'll have to do it another day.' I went a little nutsy."" Jett Travolta had a developmental disability that his parents, John Travolta and Kelly Preston, have linked to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder of the artery walls that most commonly occurs in young children and can lead to heart disease.  Watch CNN's Sunjay Gupta discuss Kawasaki disease » . In 2001, John Travolta told CNN's Larry King that his son had a near brush with death related to the condition. ""I was obsessive about cleaning -- his space being clean, so we constantly had the carpets cleaned. And I think, between him, the fumes and walking around, maybe picking up pieces or something, he got what is rarely a thing to deal with, but it's Kawasaki syndrome,"" Travolta said of his then-2-year-old son.  Watch Travolta talk about his son's condition » . ""It was that the immune system overreacts, because they have almost the equivalent of metallic chemical,"" Travolta said. In 2003, Kelly Preston told Montel Williams that when Jett was 2, he became ill with flu symptoms, including fever, rashes and swollen lymph nodes, before a doctor diagnosed him with Kawasaki disease. Echoing her husband's comments, Preston blamed chemicals in household cleaners and pesticides for attacking her son's immune system, triggering the condition. A dedicated Scientologist, Preston told Williams that she credited a detoxification program from the writings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard with helping improve her son's health. Kawasaki disease is characterized by fevers and inflammation in the blood vessels that can be caused by a number of inciting factors, including virus, bacteria or infection, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said on ""Larry King Live."" ""You get pretty sick for a few days. In the worst-case scenario, sometimes it can affect the blood vessels of the heart, called the coronary arteries,"" Gupta said. ""Sometimes they can develop aneurysms in it. That's probably the most dangerous thing. But again, this is typically a disease associated with young children. It's typically in Japan, and it's pretty rare."" Gupta said it was rare for teens to display symptoms of the disease, which usually occurs in young children. ""Most of the patients are usually between 2 and 5 years old. Sometimes they get up to age 8. But it's very rare in fact for someone to be in their teens and still have symptoms of Kawasaki. They may have had it earlier in life, but to still have any manifestations of it is unusual,"" he said. The causes of Kawasaki disease are unknown. Some scientists think it's caused by an infectious agent, such as a virus. Some studies have noted a link between the disease and carpet cleaning chemicals. John Travolta gained fame in the 1970s, starring in the television series ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" and the movies ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Grease."" His career got a boost in 1994 with his second Best Actor Oscar nomination, for his role as a hit man in ""Pulp Fiction.""

"(CNN) -- Ever since his blistering debut as an angry, disenfranchised ghetto kid in ""La Haine"", Vincent Cassel has gained a reputation for giving the kind of performances it's hard to ignore. Cassel has won plaudits for his virtuoso turn as a French gangster in the movie ""Mesrine."" Angular and athletic with a menacing pout and searing blue eyes, the French actor has made his name playing hard-edged, morally compromised, often unlikeable characters. Away from the onscreen bad boys, he's one half of France's most glamorous screen couple. His wife, the Italian actress Monica Belluci is a big name in her own right, and has starred in the last two films of the ""Matrix"" trilogy as well as acting alongside Cassel in a number of movies. A huge star at home, Cassel has enjoyed critical success abroad with roles in films like ""Eastern Promises"", David Cronenburg's 2007 tale about the Russian mafia in London, and is one of only a handful of French male stars to get parts in Hollywood. He has enjoyed cameos in ""Ocean's Twelve"" and ""Ocean's Thirteen"" as well as voicing the character of Monsieur Hood in the ""Shrek"" cartoon. That said he's yet to score a real Hollywood hit in his own right. The moment for that may not be far away, especially after his recent virtuoso turn in the French blockbuster ""Mesrine"". In the film he plays the real-life French gangster Jacques Mesrine. His performance helped make the film a huge hit in France and netted him a best actor César, the French equivalent of the Oscars. ""(Cassel) is viewed in France as a very good actor with charisma and intelligence,"" Agnes Poirier, a London-based French film critic told CNN. ""Like most intelligent actors, he's politically aware and doesn't mince his words."" France's most wanted criminal in the seventies, Mesrine is a controversial figure in his native land. A charismatic and psychotic criminal, he courted the press and was known for daring bank heists and prison breaks. He was eventually gunned down by police on the streets of Paris in 1979. The two-part movie --released in the UK and the U.S. this month -- is the perfect showcase for Cassel's muscular brand of acting and pairs him up with the grand old master of French cinema, Gerard Depardieu, who plays the head of Mesrine's band of hoodlums in the film. ""He's not yet seen on a par with Depardieu,"" said Poirier. ""Not being of a classic beauty, Cassel belongs to the ""gueules cassées"" (which literally means ""broken faces"") such as Jean-Paul Belmondo before him. It's French gallic charm with character."" Cassel's first movie role was in ""La Haine"" (or ""Hate"" in English) the 1995 indie hit about a group of youths living on a Paris housing estate. Directed by ""Amelie"" star Matthieu Kassovitz, the film stirred controversy because of its stark depiction of racial tensions. In it Cassel plays an angry young boxer with a Robert De Niro obsession. The middle-class son of the popular film actor Jean-Pierre Cassel, he was not an obvious choice to play the part of a disenfranchised street kid. Even so, he made the part his own and still maintains the movie is one of his proudest moments. ""I love that ""La Haine"" is still so accurate, but that also horrifies me,"" Cassel told London's Observer newspaper in an interview earlier this year. He told the paper that he didn't think France was a racist place but that the country still had ""many problems with our immigrant past."" The 42-year-old Parisian didn't rest on his laurels following ""La Haine."" He made a string of hard-hitting films, the most controversial of which by far was the 2002 movie ""Irréversible."" The film is told backwards and features an excruciating 10-minute rape scene in which Belluci, his wife, plays the victim. In spite of the raw subject matter, the experience of filming with his wife on ""Irréversible"" is something Cassel clearly enjoyed since the two have appeared with each other in eight other movies. The golden couple of the Gallic movie scene have a daughter together but France's strict privacy laws mean they're afforded a degree of freedom not always permitted to their Hollywood counterparts. ""The French press is famously respectful of personalities' private lives especially if those celebrities don't play with the fire of self-seeking publicity,"" said Poirier. ""Mesrine: Killer Instinct"" is in UK cinemas now. ""Mesrine: Public Enemy No.1"" is in UK cinemas 28 August .","In his latest role Vincent Cassel plays a famous French gangster .

"(CNN) -- MetroPCS, the fifth-largest U.S. wireless carrier, appears to be moving to bring more smartphones to lower-income consumers -- and also to capitalize on the FCC's new ""open internet"" rules which exempt wireless carriers from key net neutrality requirements. This mixed news could set a precedent that might eventually constrict the kind of mobile internet options available to all U.S. mobile users. Specifically, on January 3 MetroPCS announced three tiers of plans for its new 4G LTE network. Here's how The Washington Post summarized these flat-rate-per-month offerings: . • $40 ""for unlimited talk, text, 4G Web browsing with unlimited YouTube access;"" • $50 ""for unlimited talk, text, 4G Web services and unlimited YouTube; also international and premium text messaging, navigation, mobile instant messaging, corporate e-mail and 1 GB of additional data access. With Wi-Fi, customers also get audio capabilities to listen and download music and access to preview and trial video content;"" • $60 ""for the same premium features as the $50 plan, plus unlimited data access and MetroSTUDIO premium content such as 18 video-on-demand channels and audio downloads."" On the bright side, these MetroPCS plans cost considerably less than most smartphone plans currently offered by Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint -- which tend to cost at least $90 per month, with a two-year contract and high early termination fees. Plus, the fact that these are no-contract plans means that customers have more flexibility to switch phones, plans or carriers at will to suit fluctuating budgets. Such benefits might significantly influence the phone choices of many U.S. mobile users. But on January 10, a coalition of public interest groups -- including Free Press, Media Access Project, and the Center for Media Justice -- sent a letter to the FCC asking the agency to investigate whether the MetroPCS plans violate the few substantial net neutrality provisions which do apply to wireless carriers. Under the new rules, mobile providers are forbidden to block access to lawful sites, as well as applications and online services that compete with the carrier's voice or video telephony services. Wireless carriers are permitted to slow delivery of certain content for the purposes of network management. However, they are required to be transparent with the FCC, consumers, and others about how they make these decisions -- and such transparency is so far lacking from the new MetroPCS plans. In the big picture, the MetroPCS plans might deepen the mobile digital divide by normalizing the practice of charging users more to get full mobile access to a free choice of internet services and content. This would disproportionately affect lower-income mobile users and people of color, who are more likely to rely more heavily on mobile devices for internet access. As the coalition explained: ""Being forced to pay an additional monthly fee for access to new or competing services creates barriers to consumer choice and experimentation, and jeopardizes the social and economic benefits associated with the Internet."" MetroPCS denies that its new plans will limit users' online access. In a statement to The Washington Post, CEO Roger Lindquist wrote: . ""The complaints about our new, pro-consumer, pro-competitive 4G LTE rate plans are erroneous. We continue to offer consumers a full service, unlimited data plan. We increased consumer choice by adding two new rate plans that are less expensive and enable consumers to select the service and content they want at a price point they can afford. These new rate plans comply with the FCC's new rules on open mobile Internet."" This year, I expect to see this mobile drama play out on the streets of my own city, Oakland, California. My recent survey of Oakland mobile users indicated that MetroPCS is the most popular carrier in this economically challenged city -- used by nearly half of those surveyed. Only 30% of respondents used smartphones (a figure that reflects the national average), yet 80% of respondents reported accessing the Web from their phones daily or most days. This indicates a strong drive for mobile internet access. Just under 40% of those surveyed reported paying less than $50 per month for their phone. (The MetroPCS ""$40/everything"" plan is especially popular around here.) And according to recently released U.S. Census data, Oakland has a lower median per-household income than the national average. Also, 17.5% of Oakland residents are officially living in poverty. Internet access connects people to much more than YouTube, LOL Cats, and Skype. It's a portal to opportunity, learning, and much-needed services -- and these days it's necessary in order to apply for many jobs or to interact with social service agencies. Last December, MetroPCS launched its 4G network in the San Francisco metro area -- and it's reportedly live in Oakland now. I suspect that if the smartphones that go along with the new MetroPCS plans cost less than about $80, many Oaklanders will upgrade -- probably unaware of the limitations carefully built into these plans. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Amy Gahran.","MetroPCS is the fifth-largest US wireless carrier .

Hotel prices can double, or even triple, and you'll need to book well in advance. Summer means guaranteed sunshine, but it also means tropical downpours. It can also be unbearably humid, all of which means plummeting hotel prices. June to November is hurricane season, although Florida has an excellent advance warning system, which you'd do well to heed. Evergreen Everglades If you can muster the energy to haul yourself off the beach, hire a car and head west to the Evergaldes, a vast, swampy area filled with alligators, flamingoes and hundreds of bird species. Entrance to the Everglade National Park is $10 per car, which grants you access to 1.5 million acres of a unique ecosystem. Just off the southern tip of the Everglades are the Florida Keys, a 130-mile-long chain of coral islands linked by the Overseas Highway. These laid back islands are a world away form the frenetic glamour of Miami Beach. The Keys offer fishing, kayaking and snorkeling, as well as some fine beaches.","Miami is a sprawling city -- you'll need a car if you want to explore it .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- New York City's rate of HIV infection is about three times the national rate, according to estimates released Wednesday by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Rapid HIV test swabs incubate at the Iris House in New York in 2007. The agency estimates that 72 of every 100,000 New Yorkers -- a total of 4,800 individuals -- contracted HIV in 2006, more than triple the national rate of 23 per 100,000. The findings are based on new lab technology and a newly derived statistical model developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The lab technology enables health officials to determine whether HIV-positive individuals contracted the virus within the past five months, and the statistical model allows researchers to then make projections about a population's infection rate. HIV, or the human immunodeficiency virus, is the virus that causes AIDS. The Health Department points to the city's demographics. ""The populations that bear the greatest burden nationally -- blacks, for example, and men who have sex with men -- are highly represented in New York City,"" Health Commissioner Thomas Freidan said in a written statement. ""Because HIV is more prevalent within those groups, the risk of HIV infection per sexual contact is higher."" In June, the city launched a three-year initiative to administer HIV tests to the 250,000 Bronx adults who have never been tested. The program was announced just days after release of a study finding a high rate of ""unsafe sexual behavior"" in the city. Freidan said the study showed that 36 percent of gay and bisexual New York men who had five or more partners in the previous year did not use condoms consistently. ""This is a core group which is at high risk for getting and spreading HIV,"" Freidan said. In July, a study of 452 men interviewed anonymously at gay bars and clubs found 39 percent of those having sex with other men had not revealed their sexual orientation to their doctors, significantly diminishing their likelihood of being tested for HIV.","Agency estimates 72 of every 100,000 New Yorkers contracted HIV in 2006 .

"(CNN)  -- When most people think of Miami, they think of South Beach, with its glorious sands, glamorous people and gorgeous Art Deco buildings. In the 1920s and 30s Art Deco was the style of choice for the developers intent on turning Miami into a tourist hot spot and the Art Deco Historic District includes hundreds of examples of the style. Take a tour of the Art Deco historic District. The Art Deco Welcome Center (1001 Ocean Drive) is a good place to start, and no tour of the area would be complete without seeing the Marlin, Delano, National and Kent hotels in Collins Avenue, and the Crescent, Colony and Waldorf Towers hotels on Ocean Drive. Once you're done with the Deco, stroll among the boutiques and cafes of Lincoln Road, Washington Avenue and Ocean Drive. For a dash of Latin flavor, head to Little Havana. Wandering along Calle Ocho, soaking up the sights and sounds, you could almost believe you're in Cuba. Drinking a syrupy ""cafecito"" bought from a walk-up window will help you suspend your disbelief. Eccentric Coconut Grove is home to the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens (3251 S Miami Avenue). This beautiful building was created in the style of a 16th-century Italian villa by industrialist James Deering in 1916. The 30-acre gardens include Florentine gazebos and a waterfront terrazzo that looks like it's been towed straight from Venice. Inside, you'll find Deering's extensive collection of Italian art and antiques. What are your Miami must-see sights? The Coral Gables neighborhood is known as ""The City Beautiful"" and has a wonderfully Mediterranean feel. Gawp at the opulent villas that abound and then make your way to the most lavish of them all, the Biltmore Hotel (1200 Anastasia Avenue). This palatial construction was built in 1926, modeled on the Giralda bell tower in Seville, and beautifully captures the architecture of southern Spain. While you're in The City Beautiful, take a dip in the Venetian Pool (2701 De Soto Boulevard). The ornate pool was transformed from a rock quarry in 1923, and includes decorative canals, fountains, waterfalls and coral caves, while palm trees and porticos provide some welcome shade. In recent years, Miami has become something of a center for contemporary art. Sample the scene in Wynwood, an up-and-coming district that houses the Rubell Family Collection (95 NW 29th Street) and the Margulies Collection (591 NW 27th Street). In Downtown Miami, the Miami Art Museum (101 W Flagler Street) has an extensive collection of postwar art and some far out conceptual pieces. The Design District is, as the name suggests, a hotbed of art and design. The Moore Space (4040 NE 2nd Avenue) is a vast gallery that showcases cutting edge art, while the façade of the Living Room Building (4000 Miami Avenue) includes an open-air recreation of a gigantic living room. Sitting on its oversized couch is a photo-opportunity not to be missed. ...................... Miami City Guide: . Where to stay | What to see | Where to be seen | Where to eat | Where to shop .

"FLORENCE, Italy (CNN) -- Never one to follow the crowd, fashion designer Roberto Cavalli's clothes are bright, sexy and fearless. His innovative techniques, especially with leather and silk, and his love of adornment -- embroidery, applique, patchwork and diamante -- have made him the A-list's red-carpet darling. Designer Roberto Cavalli in Florence . My City, My Life spoke to Cavalli about his fashion creations, his inspiration and his city of Florence. CNN: What do you feel passionate about? Roberto Cavalli: I'm passionate to be a fashion designer, because fashion is part of our life. When you wake up in the morning you say, ""What do I have to wear to look beautiful, fantastic, sexy, special?"" Fashion is our mind. That is the reason I love being a fashion designer because I can use it to measure your mood, your life. I love being a fashion designer. CNN: What's so special about Florence? Roberto Cavalli: Florence is such a special city. I travel a lot, today I am here, tomorrow maybe in London or Paris or New York. New York is a city where I feel more excited, sometimes I say New York is like a drug it gives you so much energy, but afterwards I need Florence, I live to come back here. I need to continue to breathe art, the air that is in Florence, to walk in my city, to walk in my streets. It's so charming -- Pitti Palace, the Ponte Vecchio, Michelangelo's David. That is Florence. I love it. CNN: How has the city inspired you? Roberto Cavalli: Florence has helped me to judge what is beautiful, what is less beautiful, gave me the feeling of art. Florence and art is something that is part of my life and is part of myself. CNN: What do you love most about the city? Roberto Cavalli: What I love most about my city is the architecture, the buildings. Every time I discover something new and something different. The color of the stones, for example: I say, ""Oh my God, that stone is 700 years old; 700 years ago America doesn't exist."" It's something so special. CNN: Do you think that the architecture, the surroundings, inspire you? Roberto Cavalli: Sure, because to live in Florence means to breathe art and my collection, my fashion, why it's so unusual, so colorful. My dream, maybe because of my family of course, was to be a painter. I chose in one moment the direction of textiles; from textiles I went to fashion; but for me, I make one fashion show, it is like making one art exhibition. I would like the people that buy my clothes to understand that for me it's one small piece of art. CNN: Have you seen Florence change since you were young? Roberto Cavalli: Everything has changed, all over the world. I believe Florence has changed less than many other cities because we are more conservative, we try to keep everything that is fantastic, everything that is unbelievable, in Florence. In the next 1000 years we need to take care about the beauty and the fantastic things that are in Florence. CNN: What are your favorite colors? Roberto Cavalli: It depends on my mood. Sometimes it depends on where I am, sometimes I adore and love red, sometimes the yellow when I am in the country because the yellow that is with the green and around me I say, ""Fantastico!"" I love the turquoise when I am in my boat and around me you have the light blue, the dark blue, and I say, ""My God, I love this special turquoise combination."" I love the combination of colors. Color is my life. CNN: Where do you go to relax? Roberto Cavalli: Florence for me is my relaxing place. Also there is my factory, I have all my workers, some workers for 25, 40 years -- they love me, I love them -- but this is my relaxing place. My office, my first factory, my house -- the greenness of my house, my animals. I love my animals, they are all my babies. I love being here, being outside to read, I have music all over here. The winter, Florence is a city where we don't see the snow so much. I love to appreciate the changing of colors, the brown to red of the autumn, I love the beginning of the spring, I love to see the small flowers in the cherry trees and I can see day-by-day the difference. I like to appreciate how nature is born again. See Cavalli's Tuscan farmhouse . CNN: Where else do you like to go? Roberto Cavalli: I am a helicopter pilot. Something that gives me pleasure sometimes is taking my helicopter to go high, 2000 meter, 6000 feet, to go there and feel like a bird. In this moment I feel free. I feel in this world and life we've lost our freedom, maybe because we are too confused about the politics, maybe confused about the television that washes your brain. I love to be there flying. To feel that in the moment I move my clutch I feel like I move my wings. CNN: Is there anything about Florence that you would like to change? Roberto Cavalli: No, no, no absolutely nothing has to be changed in Florence. Florence is beautiful like it is. CNN: Where do you think your self-belief comes from? Roberto Cavalli: If you want to be successful, you have to believe in yourself. When you are not sure, you show weakness. To be strong you have to show your power, not your muscle power but the brainpower, the character of your heart. If you shoot people with the energy of your mind you become something special. CNN: You're famous for having collections that celebrate women. What kind of woman do you design for? Roberto Cavalli: I don't like to speak sometimes about beauty. I love to speak about feminism: I love to speak about a woman with a lot of personality. That is my woman. A woman that loves to show you how intelligent she is. I love women. Maybe I am the only man in the world who says the woman is stronger than the man, the woman has more personality in the world than the man, because the woman is my muse. I don't have one muse. All the women are my muse. CNN: Do you think you are a typical Florentine? Roberto Cavalli: Yes, I think I am a typical Florentine. CNN: Why? Roberto Cavalli: Because I'm a crazy artist!","Fashion designer Roberto Cavalli speaks about his hometown, Florence .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A California food processing plant is voluntarily recalling up to 1 million pounds of roasted pistachio products that may have been contaminated with salmonella, the Food and Drug Administration announced Monday. Salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by Kraft Foods, one company that purchased the nuts. The nuts came from Setton Farms in Terra Bella, California, about 75 miles south of Fresno. They were largely distributed in 2,000-pound containers to food wholesalers who would then package them for resale or incorporate them as ingredients in other products, such as ice cream and trail mix. No illnesses have been linked to this case, said Dr. David Acheson, FDA's associate commissioner. But salmonella strains were found last week during routine test by Kraft Foods, one of about three dozen companies that purchase pistachios from Setton Farms, he said. Kraft notified the FDA on March 24. Setton Farms did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Acheson emphasized that unlike the recent case of salmonella-tainted peanut butter, this recall was not prompted by an sickness outbreak, saying the decision was a ""proactive"" move. He said the FDA has received two recent complaints, from the East and West coasts, from people who say they became ill after eating pistachio products, but a link to Setton Farms has not been confirmed, he said. The FDA is advising consumers not to eat any pistachio products, but not to throw them out, either, because additional recalls are likely and having products that could be turned in would allow for easier tracing of contamination. The agency is setting up a Web site to update the public. Dr. Jeff Farrar, head of the California health department's food and drug division, said it's likely that the roasted pistachios will be found in a wide variety of products. He noted that Setton Farms is the second-largest pistachio processor in the nation. Raw pistachios are roasted to a temperature that should kill salmonella, Acheson said. Because the roasted products tested positive for salmonella suggest cross-contamination with raw products. Acheson added that the Setton Farms recall is related to the one announced Friday by Kroger, a grocery store chain with stores in 31 states. Kroger recalled Private Selection shelled pistachios from its retail stores because of possible salmonella contamination. Kroger, in a statement Friday, said no illnesses have been reported in connection with the product. In February, Kroger was among retailers that recalled peanut products tied to the Peanut Corporation of America, a Virginia-based company accused by the FDA of knowingly selling peanut butter and peanut paste that was contaminated with salmonella. PCA's peanut processing plant in Blakely, Georgia, is being investigated in connection with a salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 500 people and has been linked to eight deaths.","The pistachios, mostly sold to wholesalers, came from Setton Farms in California .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- A judge has given a Mexican singer accused of raping a teen a six-day extension to present evidence in the case, state media reported. In a hearing Saturday that was closed to the media and the public, pop singer Kalimba signed a statement stating that he was innocent of the charges, lawyer Eliezer Garcia told the state-run Notimex news agency. Prosecutors in the state of Quintana Roo allege he raped a 17-year-old girl in a hotel there in December. Last week, the singer, whose full name is Kalimba Marichal Ibar, was deported from the United States to Mexico after an immigration violation in El Paso, Texas, U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Ramiro Cordero said. The 28-year-old singer is a former member of the group OV7, and also was the voice of Simba in a Spanish version of Disney's ""The Lion King."" After Saturday's hearing, an employee and a guard at the prison where the singer is being held asked him for his autograph, Notimex said. Outside the prison, the news agency reported that hundreds of fans marched to show their support. Groups of teenagers carried signs and shouted, ""Let Kalimba out!"" and ""He is innocent!"" About 500 fans also gathered to show support for the singer in the nation's capital Saturday, Notimex said, carrying signs that said, ""Kalimba we are with you"" and ""Kalimba, cheer up, Christ loves you.""","Kalimba signs a statement that says he is innocent of the charges .

"The company began life in 1989 as MSI Cellular Investments, a telecommunications consultancy company based and operating in Africa. It was founded by Dr Mo Ibrahim. In January, 2004 the company changed its name to Celtel International. In the early days, employees were rewarded with bonuses consisting of shares, so that by 2000, 30 percent of the company was owned by staff. Although the shares were worthless until the company was listed on the stock exchange, they were given an estimated initial value of £0.14 ($0.28) each. When they were eventually bought out in 2005, they were worth £14 ($27.76). In 1998 the company expanded its services to become a mobile telephony operator and now has a series of networks in 15 different African countries, under licenses that cover more than a third of the total population of the continent. The company was acquired by Mobile Telecommunications Company KSC (MTC) in 2005 and at the time, Celtel had 4,000 employees, of which 98% were African.

"(CNN) -- As you might expect from a city that has districts called Little Havana and Little Haiti, there's no shortage of hearty Cuban and Caribbean cuisine in Miami, but the city's elaborate mix of immigrants has also resulted in some fascinating culinary fusions. The real deal: Cafe Cubano at Versailles. ""Floribbean"" cooking mixes elements of traditional Caribbean cookery with modern techniques and an emphasis on fresh produce, while the style known as ""Nuevo Latino"" revisits classic recipes from all over Latin America, using choicer cuts of meats, healthier ingredients and an added an North American sensibility. There's nothing ""nuevo"" about Versailles Restaurant (3555 SW. Eighth Street), which, in spite of the French allusions of its name, serves reassuringly traditional Cuban dishes. This Little Havana institution specializes in cheap hearty staples like ""moros"" (black beans and rice) and ""vaca frita"" (shredded fried beef with a garlic seasoning), but the real draw is people-watching in the heart of the Cuban exile community, as the émigrés reminisce about the old country. The Versailles bakery next door does great empanadas, fruit juices and Cuban coffee, which is an entirely different beast from the regular American filter variety. Café cubano, or ""cafecito,"" is like a sweet espresso and is served in tiny, potent shots. Add a splash of steamed milk to get a delicious ""cortadito."" Outside Little Havana, David's Café (1058 Collins Avenue) in South Beach knows how to whip up a mean ""café con leche."" As with so many things in Miami, when it comes to fine dining, South Beach is the place to be. If you like to eat in the company of the glitterati and you've got the bank balance to back you up, take your meat-loving self to Prime One Twelve (112 Ocean Drive). It may be just a steakhouse, but this is the kind of steakhouse favored by A-list celebs. A filet mignon will set you back $52, and you'll love all 12 juicy ounces of it, while a dessert of fried Oreos is diet-wreckingly good. Do you agree with our Miami picks? Or have we missed out your favorite spot? Tell us in the sound-off box beow. Elsewhere in South Beach, Lincoln Road is home to some very chic eateries, many of which get away with charging ridiculous prices for very ordinary fare. Fortunately, there's Sushi Samba Dromo (600 Lincoln Rd), with its seafood-based fusion of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine. Think sashimi flavored with exotic fruits and you'll be on the right track. Kind of... For sushi of the more traditional kind, try Nobu at the Shores Club hotel (1901 Collins Ave, Miami Beach), which also does excellent tempura and teriyaki. Joe's Stone Crab (11 Washington Ave) is another South Beach favorite. Joe's doesn't take reservations and there are huge queues for its legendary crab, but if you've got better things to do than queue for two hours for your supper, you can always grab a takeout from the counter next door. If you want to impress that special someone, there's nowhere better than Casa Tua (1700 James Avenue). This secluded, romantic hideaway has superb Italian food and is suitably expensive. Vegetarians are well catered for at the Lost and Found Saloon (185 NW 36th Street) in the Wynwood neighborhood, a relaxed but stylish option for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Gourmet Carrot (959 West Avenue, Miami Beach) is another good spot for veggies, or anyone with a hankering for a deliciously healthy smoothie. ...................... Miami City Guide: .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Authorities in southwestern Afghanistan have seized 19 tons of explosive devices that had been transferred across the border from Iran, police said. Nimruz Police Chief Abdul Jabar Purdel said a suspect was detained. Nimruz province, in Afghanistan's southwestern corner, borders Iran and Pakistan . The devices had been placed in 337 boxes inside a 40-foot shipping container transferred from Iran over a bridge linking Afghanistan and Iran, he said. Earlier this year, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said that new U.S. military intelligence suggests Iran planned to smuggle new shipments of weapons into Afghanistan as part of an increased effort to interfere with coalition operations. The information came from an ""Iranian source"" whose tips on past shipments have been verified by the United States, the official said in April. The official also noted that Iran -- a majority Shiite country -- and the Sunni Taliban almost went to war with one another in the late 1990s, so it's not really in their interest to be a major source of top-shelf arms to the Taliban. Tehran has consistently denied supporting groups opposed to the Afghan government. U.S. and coalition troops have found evidence of some Iranian weapons inside Afghanistan in seized caches or in the aftermath of attacks.","Material is found in Nimruz province .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan coach Leonardo does not want unsettled midfielder Gennaro Gattuso to leave the club during the winter transfer market. The veteran has failed to earn a regular spot in Leonardo's side because of injuries and the coach's squad rotation policy. Gattuso, a near-certain selection for Italy's World Cup squad, said last week he could leave Milan before the end of his contract in June 2011 if his playing time did not increase. ""If Gattuso has this idea in his head, I will try to make him change his mind,"" Leonardo told reporters. ""I know Rino (Gattuso) well. I played with him. I always speak to Gattuso and try to be very clear. Now the most important thing is that he recovers from the muscular injury."" Gattuso has been a reported target for Manchester City but AC Milan club administrator Adriano Galliani added: ""The other day I showed him (Gattuso) the midfield of the top five teams in Europe and he would not have been a starter in any of those. ""Why leave, only to be relegated to the bench somewhere else?"" The 31-year-old has been with the Rossoneri since 1999 and was a crucial member of the Italy squad which won the 2006 World Cup.

"(CNN) -- Britain and France are calling for an additional 3,000 United Nations troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the U.N. already has its biggest peacekeeping mission, a senior British diplomat said Wednesday. A U.N. peacekeeper rides atop an armored vehicle last week in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo. Mark Malloch-Brown, the British Foreign Office minister for Africa, the Middle East and the United Nations, announced a draft resolution on the troop increase while on a four-day mission to the war-torn Congo. Britain expects the U.N. Security Council to adopt the resolution by the end of the week, a spokeswoman for the British mission to the United Nations said. The resolution follows calls from the United Nations' own peacekeeping experts, Human Rights Watch, and local human rights groups in Congo for more troops to support the 17,000 U.N. soldiers already there. A coalition of 44 organizations in eastern Congo wrote to the Security Council on Tuesday, pleading for more troops. ""This would help to prevent the atrocities that continue to be committed against civilians on an ever greater scale here in North Kivu [province], on the border of Rwanda and Uganda,"" the coalition wrote. Fighting between government forces, allied militias and rebels under the command of Laurent Nkunda has forced an estimated 250,000 people to flee their homes since August. ""Since August 28, fighting has intensified in many areas, causing deaths, rapes, lootings, forced recruitment and further displacements of civilian populations,"" the local coalition wrote. ""The population has thus been immersed in unspeakable suffering. In the last few days, fighting has drawn closer to large populated areas, such as the town of Goma. Fighting has also invaded and torn apart the region of Rutshuru, particularly in the town of Kiwanja, where hundreds of civilian deaths have now been recorded."" The letter echoes concerns expressed by the British aid group Oxfam last week. ""The world is failing in its responsibility to protect the Congo's innocent civilians,"" Juliette Prodhan, the head of Oxfam in Congo, said in a statement released November 13.  Watch international efforts to avoid a health catastrophe in Congo » . ""There has been an increase in incidents of forced labor, rape and widespread brutality, according to assessments carried out by international agency Oxfam over the past week, as armed men from all sides prey upon those who have sought 'sanctuary' from the fighting in North Kivu"" province, she said. Another aid group, World Vision, says the conflict in the African country is the deadliest since World War II. The country has been at war since 1997. ""The last decade of conflict has resulted in some 4 million deaths; an estimated 1,200 people die every day due to ongoing epidemics and war-related causes; some aid agencies estimate upward of 1,400 deaths per day,"" World Vision said in a statement. The local groups in Congo specifically requested help from the European Union, which can deploy military units faster than the United Nations can. Georgette Gagnon, the executive director for the Africa division of Human Rights Watch, said she also would like to see the European Union send troops.

"(CNN) -- German Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich have confirmed Mark van Bommel as their captain for the new season, with Philipp Lahm named as vice-captain. Bayern Munich captain Van Bommel will be hoping to lift more trophies for the Bavarian giants this season. The Dutch midfielder was given the captain's armband by Jurgen Klinsmann last season after Oliver Kahn retired. However, the arrival of Anatoliy Tymoschuk from Zenit St Petersburg seemed to suggest that Van Bommel's place in the Bayern team was no longer guaranteed, but new coach Louis Van Gaal has decided that his compatriot will indeed be one of the first names on his team sheet next season. ""We have been observing his behavior on and off the field over the last four weeks and the influence he has on the club and on the squad,"" explained Van Gaal's assistant Andries Jonker on Bayern's official Web site. Tymoschuk must now fear for his place in the Bayern team after being told he is only second-choice behind Van Bommel. And, since Van Gaal has made it clear that he wanted to choose a captain who will play every week, Tymoschuk may have to spend much of his first season in Bavaria sitting on the substitutes' bench. ""He cannot play in his best position in our system,"" admitted Van Gaal. ""That is where Van Bommel plays. He could play on the right, but I have chosen Hamit Altintop for there. Every player is compared to his rivals and the coach makes the decisions."" Meanwhile, Bayern's French midfielder Franck Ribery has been declared fit to resume training after a summer spent battling tendonitis in his knee. Ribery missed the pre-season Audi Cup tournament involving Manchester United, AC Milan and Boca Juniors and is not likely to make Saturday's opening Bundesliga home match against Hoffenheim. But the France international, who was Monday called into his country's squad for the World Cup qualifier with the Faroe Isles in Torshavn on August 12, will be ready to train on Wednesday, .","Bayern Munich confirm Mark van Bommel as their captain for the new season .

Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has been dropped from Stuttgart's first-team after he paid an unauthorized visit to the Oktoberfest. The 39-year-old former Germany international was spotted at Munich's beer festival following Stuttgart's 2-0 home defeat to Cologne in the Bundesliga and did not have permission to attend. Lehmann made an error to gift Cologne their second goal of the match when he raced out of his area only to lose possession and allow Wilfried Sanou to shoot into an empty net from 45 yards out. Marcus Babbel confirmed the decision to axe him from the side and told the Stuttgart Web site: ""Director of sport Horst Heldt and I will talk with Jens about this on Thursday and then we will see where to go."" Lehmann apologized for breaking club rules, accepted the suspension and claimed his motives were in a good cause.

"(CNN) -- Ronaldinho plundered a hat-trick as AC Milan crushed 10-man Siena 4-0 on Sunday to close the gap on Serie A leaders Inter Milan to just six points and with the Milan derby to come next week. Milan also have a game in hand meaning they could potentially draw level with the four-in-a-row champions if they were to win next weekend's crunch clash. The hosts started in determined mood following Inter's 2-2 draw at Bari on Saturday and Ronaldinho took an Alessandro Nesta cross on his chest on three minutes before sending a spectacular overhead bicycle kick just off target. But on 10 minutes the referee took the decision that essentially ended the game as a contest. Jardim Brandao dithered on the ball in his own box and Marco Borriello dispossessed him before trying to go round goalkeeper Gianluca Curci. There was minimal contact and Borriello crumpled to the ground but the striker's last touch had been too heavy and left him no chance of reaching the ball before a back-tracking defender. Even so, the referee pointed to the spot and showed Curci a straight red card. Substitute goalkeeper Gianluca Pegolo's first task was to pick the ball out of his net. Siena battled on gamely, and on 26 minutes Massimo Maccarone escaped three defenders on the edge of the Milan box to bundle through before firing over on the stretch as Thiago Silva came across to put him under pressure. Two minutes later the lead was doubled as Andrea Pirlo curled a cross into the near post and Borriello hooked a brilliant volley over his shoulder and into the top corner. Ronaldinho proved a constant menace and had two early second half chances, flicking the ball over the bar with the first and being denied by Pegolo with the second. But 18 minutes from time he rose unmarked in the box to head home a David Beckham corner. The Brazilian sealed his first Milan hat-trick with a rocket into the top corner from outside the area a minute from time. Meanwhile, Juventus slumped to their seventh defeat in 10-games with a 1-0 reverse at Chievo that is sure to increase the pressure on under-fire coach Ciro Ferrara. Gennaro Sardo's stunning first-half strike proved to be the only goal of the game as Juve turned in a performance lacking energy and confidence which comes on the back of a 3-0 hammering at the hands of Milan in their last league outing. Juve dropped to fifth and out of the Champions League places as both Roma and Napoli overtook them. Roma moved up to third as on-loan Bayern Munich striker Luca Toni scored his first goals for the club in a 3-0 win over Genoa. Simone Perrotta opened the scoring on 17 minutes after a scramble at a corner and then Toni turned home Mirko Vucinic's cross on the stroke of half-time. And, on the hour mark, Vucinic turned provider again for Toni to head home his second. Napoli could not fully capitalize as they were held 0-0 at home by Palermo but still extended their unbeaten league run to 14 matches.","Brazilian Ronaldinho plundered a hat-trick as AC Milan crushed 10-man Siena 4-0 in Serie A .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A U.S. professor claims he has identified the parts of the brain that help to make someone a good leader. Pierre Balthazard is using EEG to find out what parts of the brain are involved in leadership. Pierre Balthazard, an associate professor at the Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, also says he can use neuroscientific techniques to help people improve the skills that play a part in leadership. Balthazard uses electroencephalography (EEG) to produce a ""brain map"" of his subjects. By attaching electrodes to their heads, he says he can measure electrical activity generated by neurons in their brain. Much of his work has focused on calibrating the EEG data with standard psychometric tests, and now Balthazard says that just by looking at someone's brain map he can predict their capacity for certain traits linked to leadership. ""From someone's brain map I can tell if someone would rank high, medium or low on a psychometric assessment of their transformational leadership, and just that is an earth-shattering finding,"" he told CNN. He has been working with the U.S. military to produce a model that will allow them to scan soldiers' brains for complexity. The idea is that more complex brains produce better situational awareness and adaptive thinking -- essential skills for the modern soldier, who must be able to transition from front-line combat to nation building. He refers to traits like complexity and transformational leadership as antecedents to leadership itself. But for Balthazard, the ability to assess these skills is only half the story. What really excites him is the possibility of brain training and improving leadership skills. ""If you could only assess and not develop then it's only an exercise in social engineering, and that's of no interest to me,"" he said. Balthazard explained that brains can be trained using positive and negative reinforcement, in the same way that disorders like ADD are treated. A subject is wired to software programmed to recognize ""correct"" functioning of a specific part of the brain. If the brain isn't performing correctly, there is a negative reinforcement, such as a noise emitted from a speaker at an unpleasant frequency. ""The brain is amazing at adjusting so it doesn't get the negative feedback,"" he told CNN. But others think it may prove difficult to develop something as intangible as leadership. Dr Bob Kentridge, a member of the Cognitive Neuroscience Research Unit at Durham University, in England, told CNN, ""Even if you find differences in the brains of people with different leadership abilities, it's very difficult to say if that difference is just related to leadership. ""It could be due to all sorts of things that might be fairly tangentially related to leadership."" ""Leadership is such a fuzzy quality that it's hard to say conclusively what you are changing,"" Kentridge added. ""You might change things that contribute to leadership, for example people might learn to stay calmer in conflict situations, but is that the same as saying you're improving the leadership center of your brain?"" So, what's inside the brain of a born leader? Interestingly, intelligence is not a requirement. ""There's zero correlation between IQ and leadership,"" Balthazard told CNN. ""Emotion control has a lot to do with leadership. People who lead very well tend to have a much more coherent brain on the emotional, right side, and more differentiated brain on the more rational, left side, that can assess more different options."" Balthazard says that although he has identified brain profiles for antecedents to leadership, he stresses that before he can produce a set of exercises designed to improve leadership itself, he must develop a ""leadership norm"" -- a standard for what makes a good leader. He has currently analyzed the brains of between 200 and 225 subjects, including bankers and military leaders, and says he must test twice that amount before he has his ""norm."" But he said plenty of people are already going to neurotherapists to train their brain for skills linked to leadership, such as decision-making, cognition, and memory retrieval, and Balthazard says he'll soon be able to use neuotherapy techniques to develop leadership itself. ""At some point in the next 18 months we'll have a seminal paper out that says we've done this. We're not there yet but I've seen it in the lab."" If that happens, budding CEOs might be queuing up at neurotherapists to plug themselves in and turn themselves into the business brains of the future.","Researcher says he can spot a good leader just by scanning their brain .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The miners who survived 69 days in a Chilean mine toured Hollywood and Sunset Boulevard in two double-decker buses Thursday evening, receiving cheers and a hero's welcome from passersby in the the street. The miners serenaded anyone who would listen. ""Chi-chi-chi!"" ""Le-le-le!"" ""We the miners of Chile!"" they sang in unison. Some people from the street and even a rooftop sang ""Chile!"" in return. The 33 miners, along with relatives and five of their rescuers, landed in Los Angeles earlier in the day Thursday for their . first group tour to the United States since being freed last month. The group is in the nation's second-largest city to attend ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,"" which will air worldwide on . Thanksgiving evening, November 25. Organizers invited them as special guests. The Los Angeles police department gave the miners' two-bus entourage a motorcycle escort from Los Angeles International Airport to a downtown hotel. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa greeted the group at the hotel with the traditional Spanish saying of ""mi casa es su casa,"" or ""my house is your house."" ""The entire world was watching the success of your rescue,"" Villaraigosa told the group. Later, the miners, rescuers and their relatives ventured outside the hotel for the first time and found a TV news helicopter and local news stations filming them as they boarded two double-decker buses. The entourage visited Hollywood landmarks such as the Walk of Fame stars on Hollywood Boulevard, including one belonging to Elvis Presley. It was an appropriate pilgrimage because miner Edison Pena had led sing-alongs to Elvis music to lift the spirits of fellow miners during the dark ordeal. In fact, he had asked for the music to be sent down into the mine as rescuers drilled a bigger hole to pull the miners out of the ground. ""He is the king, he is the best,"" Pena, 34, said, as he posed for photographs beside Elvis' star on Hollywood Boulevard. ""The sweetest of dreams."" The entourage strolled outside the landmark Capitol Records building, built to resemble a stack of records on a turntable. They walked to the heart of the Hollywood noir district, at Hollywood and Vine Boulevards, which is enjoying a construction boom. They also toured Beverly Hills and its Rodeo Drive boutique district. Bus guides also showed them the grand business concourse of Wilshire Boulevard. Throughout the sightseeing, the miners, wives and relatives took photographs on their cameras or smartphones. Shortly after their arrival at the hotel Thursday morning, the miner known as ""the poet"" was freewheeling in the hallway with the other miner known as ""Super Mario."" ""Where can we go dancing?"" shouted Mario Sepulveda, 40, the Chilean miner whose exuberant personality earned him the super nickname. He and Victor Zamora, 34, the miner-poet, were expressing the collective excitement of the miners, rescuers and their families. For the majority of the visitors, the trip was their first time outside of Chile. At the top of their to-do list, besides resting after a 12-hour flight from Santiago, Chile, was shopping. ""I want to go to the mall and buy some shoes for my son and daughter,"" said Katty Valdivia, 40, the wife of Sepulveda. For miner Juan Carlos Aguilar, 49, and wife Cristy Coronado, 40, the visit was a double celebration -- because they experienced the birth of their first grandchild, Emily Sofia Studer, born Wednesday. When Aguilar was trapped in the mine for 69 days, his wife was concerned whether the ordeal would be too much of a strain on her pregnant 17-year-old daughter, Damaris. ""We were really worried,"" Coronado said, speaking in Spanish as did his colleagues. ""My daughter was far into her pregnancy and we were all consumed with what could happen. For those 69 days, we were a separated family."" The miner-poet Zamora said he overcame the gloom of entrapment by doing something he had never done before: write poetry. He wrote 32 poems -- about his wife, mother, son, relatives, friends. He left copies of his verse at home and was unable to share his poetry. ""I never wrote before,"" Zamora said. ""It was a way of keeping me from suffering inside the mine. I wrote about feelings and how people were suffering on the outside and how they would ever rescue us."" Like some other miners, he readily offered up his autographs to anyone wanting to meet him. ""The Poet,"" he wrote in Spanish near his name. Monica Araya, the wife of Florencio Avalos, the first miner who was pulled out of the ground last month, described the 69 days of waiting and wondering as one of her worst experiences. ""It was bad, really bad,"" said Araya. ""I couldn't believe it. I was worried about his life, but I believed they would all survive because I had faith and hope."" She has since noticed a few different things about herself and husband. ""We have changed,"" Araya said. ""We are more sentimental, and we enjoy more what moments we have together."" Before arriving in Los Angeles, the group made a brief stopover at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, where the miners signed flags. One signed ""Corazon de Minero,"" which means ""heart of a miner."" When miner Richard Villarroell prepared to board the plane in Santiago, Chile, on Wednesday night, the 27-year-old said he has only traveled to Argentina. ""I want to see the world,"" he said, smiling. ""I know all of Chile, but not the rest of the world."" Villarroell, a mechanic, worked at the San Jose mine for two years. His girlfriend was pregnant while he was trapped. The miners captured the world's imagination when they survived the longest mine entrapment in history, beginning August 5. For more than two weeks, many officials thought they were dead. But crews made contact after a small borehole enabled communication with the men trapped 2,300 feet underground. Rescue crews encountered repeated setbacks. Initially, authorities expected the miners to be trapped until Thanksgiving or Christmas because of the difficulty of drilling a new tunnel to extract them. On their U.S. trip, the miners and rescuers will get a whirlwind tour of southern California. They'll see the sights and shop in Los Angeles and Hollywood through the weekend. The visit is a world away from the miners' experience in the weeks after the mine collapse that trapped them. In the days before they made contact with the ground, some ate about a bottle cap's worth of canned fish per day and drank mine water that tasted like machine oil. They have said they were prepared to die, even as they awaited their rescue. The miners and rescuers were invited by CNN to attend ""Heroes,"" an annual program now in its fourth year that shines a light on ""everyday people changing the world."" The Chileans were extended the invitation because their plight and rescue captured the world's attention and symbolized the resilience of the human spirit. CNN Heroes received 10,000 nominations from more than 100 countries. That list was narrowed down to the Top 10 CNN Heroes. The Hero of the Year will be revealed on the show; the public votes to select that winner. ""The heroic efforts of the rescue of these miners was one of the most unifying and inspirational events of the year,"" said Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide. ""CNN Heroes is a fitting way for CNN to honor these men and their rescuers,"" he said. ""We hope viewers around the world will be heartened by the story of their rescue as well as the stories of this year's top 10 CNN Heroes.""' The miners' imprisonment began when a ramp into the San Jose mine -- located in the arid Atacama region of northern Chile -- collapsed. Shift foreman Luis Urzua told the men that they had a shot of surviving the catastrophe, but there was a good chance they would never again see daylight. The men occupied themselves by voting on everything, including how food should be distributed. Majority rule prevailed -- 17 votes plus one -- but the miners often managed to find common ground and most decisions were unanimous. Everyone had a task. No one was left alone. And they became masters of compromise and patience, even as their rations quickly began running out.

"(CNN) -- Spanish Primera Liga big-spenders Real Madrid have pruned their squad after their summer transfer splurge by completing the sales of Dutchmen Arjen Robben to Bayern Munich and Wesley Sneijder to Inter Milan. Arjen Robben (left) meets his new coach Louis van Gaal after completing his move to Bayern Munich. Robben, 25, has moved to the Bundesliga for an undisclosed fee on a four-year contract, while Sneijder has joined the Italian Serie A champions also on a four-year contract for a reported 15 million euros ($22m). Both players will wear the number 10 jerseys for their new clubs. Robben could make his debut in Saturday's mouth-watering clash with German champions Wolfsburg, with Bayern coach Louis van Gaal telling the club's official Web site: ""I am very happy to have another creative player. Arjen is a very explosive player."" Robben said Bayern had ""given me a good feeling"" from the moment they first signalled their interest in signing him. ""I feel very welcome here,"" he told the club's Web site. ""This is a big club with a great history and I am delighted to be here now."" Robben's chances of being a regular in Real's star-studded side appeared to have reduced when Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka were both signed this summer, but the former Chelsea winger still seemed keen to stay at the Bernabeu. That was until Bayern firmed up their interest and offered him the opportunity to play on a more regular basis. ""Everything went so quickly,"" he revealed. ""There were a few things that I had to consider and in the end I decided that I would like to transfer to a big club like FC Bayern."" While, Bayern were parading their new signing, Sneijder, also 25, was being introduced to the Italian media after finalizing his move . Sneijder joined Madrid in 2007 after five years with Ajax, and in his first season in Spain helped his new club win the Primera Division title. The two Dutchmen are the latest in a long line of players to leave Madrid this summer in the wake of the club's phenomenal spending spree that has seen them splash out over 250 million euros ($357m) on players such as Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema and Xavi Alonso. Aside from Sneijder and Robben, fellow-Dutchman Klaas Jan Huntelaar has been sold to AC Milan, Alvaro Negredo has joined Sevilla, while the likes of Javier Saviola, Michel Salgado, Gabriel Heinze, Fabio Cannavaro and Javi Garcia have also bid farewell to Madrid this summer. Meanwhile, it has been another busy day of transfer activity in the English Premier League with plenty of deals going through. Everton have completed the signing of Portsmouth defender Sylvain Distin on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee. The 31-year-old Frenchman will replace Joleon Lescott in the center of the Merseyside club's defence, following the England international's protracted sale to Manchester City. Meanwhile, Portsmouth, who have seen a host of top players leave this summer culminating in Distin's exit, have gone some way to restoring the depth of their squad by bringing in a remarkable four players on a hectic day at Fratton Park. Midfielder Michael Brown, 32, has joined from Wigan for an undisclosed fee while two players have joined on loan; Tottenham midfielder Jamie O'Hara and Ivorian striker Aruna Dindane from Lens with a view to a permanent move. Meanwhile, O'Hara's Tottenham team-mate Kevin-Prince Boateng -- who spent last season on loan at Borussia Dortmund -- has also joined Portsmouth on a three-year contract for a fee of $6.5m. The 22-year-old German midfielder has failed to establish himself at White Hart Lane since joining from Hertha Berlin in 2007. Sunderland have completed their sixth signing of the summer with the capture of Lyon's Ghanaian international defender John Mensah on a season-long loan with a view to a permanent deal. Elsewhere, West Ham have completed the signing of highly-rated striker Alessandro Diamanti from Serie A side Livorno for an undisclosed fee. Diamanti, 26, has penned a five-year contract at Upton Park after agreeing personal terms and passing a medical -- while Stoke have completed the signing of Turkish international striker Tuncay Sanli from Middlesbrough, the day after swooping for German defender Roberth Huth from the same club. In other transfer news, striker Vagner Love has joined former club Palmeiras on loan from CSKA Moscow until summer 2010. The 25-year-old Brazilian joined CSKA from Palmeiras in 2004 and established himself as a firm favorite in the Russian capital -- scoring 61 goals in 118 appearances, winning two Russian titles and a UEFA Cup winners' medal in the process.","Real Madrid complete sale of Dutchmen Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder .

"(CNN)  -- Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has fought off competition from a clutch of Manchester United players to be named Footballer of the Year in England. Gerrard has proved the driving force for Liverpool this season. The 28-year-old England international topped the poll of journalists ahead of United pair Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney with their teammates Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand rounding out the top five. Gerrard secured 73 votes from a total of 202 with Giggs on 63. The prestigious award has been running since 1948 and been won by some of the greats of the game such as Stanley Matthews, Bobby Moore and George Best. The chairman of the football writers' association Steve Bates gave the reasons for his selection. ""Steven's performances this season have been of the highest quality,"" he told Press Association. ""His drive and desire have underpinned Liverpool's Premier League title challenge and ensured a tight finish to the season."" Gerrard, who was brought up on Merseyside, has been in outstanding form for Liverpool this season in their sustained challenge to Manchester United in the Premier League title race, scoring 15 goals from midfield. His loyalty to his hometown club saw him reject overtures from Chelsea soon after helping Liverpool to their epic Champions League victory over AC Milan in 2005. Gerrard's ultimate ambition in club football is to help the Reds win the English championship for the first time since 1990. He is the first Liverpool player to win the award since John Barnes from that successful side. ""I'm delighted but I'm a little bit surprised,"" the 28-year-old told his club's official Web site. ""When you look at the quality of the players there are in this league, it's a great privilege to win this kind of award.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If Manchester United and Liverpool fans are expecting the arrival of superstar players ahead of the new season then they had better think again, as the cost of refinancing debt could significantly curb the club's spending power according to industry experts. Liverpool co-owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks took over the club in February 2007 . Financial prudence will be the watchword for the majority of the English Premier League in the transfer market as clubs look to consolidate their financial position in a move that could see a shift of power in Europe to Spain's La Liga. United have received $130 million for the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid, but the Glazer family owners will not sanction anywhere near that amount for new players according to Professor Rogan Taylor at the University of Liverpool's Football Industry Group. The Americans' takeover of the Red Devils placed the club in $1,100m of debt, according to the holding companies' accounts of 2009; a situation that requires careful management. ""The refinancing at Manchester United is structured in a very complex way but ultimately the economic difficulties now mean that there will be a reduction in Alex Ferguson's transfer budget,"" he told CNN. ""Although some of the funds from the Ronaldo transfer will go back into the club's coffers there will be a tightening of the purse strings which will seriously impact on United's capacity to go after the top players. ""Certainly, Ferguson would have wanted a top-class replacement for Ronaldo but with the need to keep the debt in order and -- being unable to compete with Real Madrid and Manchester City -- the funds available and the pool of players from which they can sign is a lot smaller.""  Liverpool's situation is even more acute as American co-owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks, through their company Kop Holdings, struggle to secure the finances to fund the club's proposed new stadium. A deal to refinance their $570m Royal Bank of Scotland loan appears to have been secured, but the long-term sustainability of the idea used to purchase Liverpool is serious under question.  Will Liverpool and Manchester United splash the cash in the transfer market despite the financial problems? Who would you like to see them sign? Let us know your comments in the 'Sound off' box below. Professor Taylor added: ""The whole model on which Hicks and Gillett bought Liverpool is flawed and Rafael Benitez may have to sell Javier Mascherano or Xabi Alonso before he can go out and spend during the close season. ""Even then there is no certainty he will get the whole amount from the sale of either of those players back in the transfer kitty so it promises to be a difficult period for Liverpool as obviously expectation has been raised following last season's second-place finish. ""The need to refinance the debt remains key to the American owners remaining in control of the club so that will be their priority -- at the expense of matters on the pitch."" Jon Keen deputy chairman of the Football Supporters Federation, and an expert in the field of club governance and ownership, admitted the situation at both clubs will stir up further resentment among fans towards their owners. ""The current refinancing situation in the top-flight is like a financial house cards which could come crashing down at any time,"" he told CNN. ""We have already seen a situation unravel with the banking system which has angered a lot of people and something similar could well happen with football in the near future. ""Ultimately fans want to see money raised from sales of players either put back into the transfer pot or levied against their own costs of attending matches, not simply servicing huge amounts of debt as is the case with Manchester United and Liverpool at the moment. ""There needs to be a reality check about the way these clubs are operating. Certainly, I think the current economic climate will drastically reduce the spending power of clubs in the Premier League with the exception perhaps of Manchester City."" Of course, this contrasts with Spain's Real Madrid who have recently splashed almost $300m on Ronaldo, Kaka and Karim Benzema -- and are not finished yet if president Florentino Perez is to be believed. The construction magnate and his powerful board are able to wield influence with banks and allow Real to secure credit on favorable terms which, combined with a lucrative domestic television rights deal, puts them in a stronger financial position. Ultimately this appears to have precipitated a shift away from the English Premier League to La Liga for the world's best players as Spain becomes the preferred destination of choice. Whether Real can convert this into a challenge to the recent English domination of the UEFA Champions League on the pitch remains to be seen.","Refinancing has left Manchester United and Liverpool short of transfer funds .

"Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from CNN executive producer and author Suzanne Simons' new book, ""Master of War: Blackwater's Erik Prince and the Global Business of War."" Donna Zovko, mother of Jerry Zovko, who was killed in Fallujah, testifies at a House hearing. (CNN) -- March 31, 2004, started early for the four men and the convoy they were escorting. Their differences set aside for the time being, the men hopped into their Pajeros and pulled out, heading to the heart of Falluja. Westerners would typically avoid the downtown area, opting instead for a bypass route around the city, but that morning, the convoy set out on Highway 10, right through the busy streets of the city. There were just two men per vehicle. Two of the men who would have provided rear cover in the vehicles had been held back to help with clerical work. Scott Helvenston and Mike Teague were in one SUV, Wesley Batalona and Jerry Zovko in another, as the convoy drove a little over a mile into town. With traffic coming to a halt, the convoy found itself stuck in a growing swarm of traffic and people. Suddenly, a few armed men emerged from the streets and approached the vehicle that Helvenston and Teague were in. They fired off shots, hitting the Blackwater men in the back of the head, the stricken men's bodies slumping forward in their seats.   Witnesses watched the other Pajero attempting to move out of the way, but it failed to pass through the gathering crowd fast enough. Within minutes of the first attack, Zovko and Batalona were also shot. The crowd began working itself into a frenzy. Locals videotaped as a mob of men and boys began to chant and celebrate, many of them cheering, ""Falluja is the graveyard of Americans."" The video showed a chilling display of hatred, as the bodies were burned, ripped from the vehicles, beaten and dragged through the streets to a steel bridge spanning the Euphrates River. The crowd was jubilant, chanting like football fans celebrating a Super Bowl victory. A torso, now decapitated, was tied with electrical cord and hung from the girders. A second body, blackened from the fire, was also strung up for the cheering crowd to see. It was sometime between 3:30 and 4:30 in the morning in McLean, Virginia, when Erik Prince got the call. In Moyock, North Carolina, Gary Jackson had gotten word of the attack as well. Jackson headed into his office at the Blackwater training facility, where he was joined by Chris Taylor, who had just been promoted to vice president of strategic initiatives, and Mike Rush, the director of Blackwater Security Consulting.   They linked up with Prince by phone, as he arrived at his unmarked office in a McLean high-rise in the dark hours of morning. The details were still sketchy, but they knew that four of their own had been killed. ""I'd been a low-level officer before, but I'd never had anybody under my responsibility seriously injured or killed,"" said Prince. ""That struck home."" It wasn't long before the images began showing up on TV screens. The pictures shown on Arabic networks were incredibly disturbing: the chanting crowd, the burning vehicles, the bodies hanging from the bridge. Even what aired on American networks was disturbing, and those pictures were heavily edited. ""It was already on CNN,"" said Taylor. ""We had preliminary information that it was our guys."" It was an outrage for Prince, remembering his trip to the area just weeks before. ""The first thing I thought of when I saw that was Jerry [Zovko] would be the guy to go and sort this out and find the guys who did this,"" said Prince. By midmorning, the worst was confirmed. The four men were four of their own. Prince, Jackson, Taylor, and Rush knew what they had to do. Jackson was angry but tried to keep his emotions in check. ""I was pissed; you know, I come from the Special Operations community, and I was mainly just pissed,"" said Jackson. ""You've got to understand at that particular point in time, no matter how bad it was, it was going, and we had stuff to do."" The four dead men had listed next of kin information in the company paperwork. The four Blackwater executives packed their bags and headed out to inform the families. U.S. marshals or sheriff 's deputies would be waiting at their respective destinations. Prince set out for Cleveland, Ohio, to tell Jerry Zovko's parents. Jackson, who had seen Mike Teague less than two weeks before, would be the one to tell Teague's wife and 15-year-old son that Mike wouldn't be coming home. Taylor headed for a San Diego, California, suburb to tell Tricia Irby, Scott Helvenston's ex-wife, that the father of her children had been killed. Rush was on a plane bound for Hawaii. That afternoon, Katy Helvenston was sitting in her home office in a bedroom community just outside Orlando, Florida, when images of the gruesome, chaotic mob scene flashed on her TV screen. She couldn't help but think briefly of the son she called Scotty.","Blackwater sent personnel to Falluja on March 31, 2004 .

"(CNN)  -- Afghan civilians were killed in U.S. airstrikes during fighting this week in western Afghanistan, local officials and the Red Cross said. Villagers pray at a mass grave this week after an airstrike in  Afghanistan's Farah province. The reports come as concerns mount over noncombatant casualties in the war against the Taliban. But the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said the U.S. military suspects the incident started when Taliban militants entered the area and beheaded three civilians. And another senior U.S. military official said Taliban militants may have killed as many as 15 civilians with grenades and then paraded their shrapnel-riddled bodies through villages in western Afghanistan. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she ""deeply regrets"" the loss of civilian lives but pointed out ""we don't know all of the circumstances"" and promised an investigation. Afghan officials have said that a number of civilians died Tuesday during U.S. airstrikes on villages in Farah Province. The International Committee of the Red Cross said in a news release that its ""impression was that dozens of people, including women and children, had been killed."" The ICRC workers were told that some of the dead had already been buried by the time they arrived on the scene. ""We are deeply concerned by these events,"" Reto Stocker, the ICRC's head of delegation in Kabul, Afghanistan, said in a statement. ""We know that those killed included an Afghan Red Crescent volunteer and 13 members of his family who had been sheltering from fighting in a house that was bombed in an airstrike."" But U.S. officials believe the Taliban deliberately engineered a ground attack against Afghan and U.S. forces, expecting the United States would call in airstrikes. They said the Taliban were then prepared to kill the civilians. A senior U.S. military official said there was ""very reliable intelligence"" that Taliban fighters rounded up three families, including women and children, and killed them with grenades. The official would not allow his name to be used because a preliminary investigation into the matter is ongoing and no conclusions have been reached. Their bodies, shrapnel wounds visible, were then put into the backs of trucks and driven through the area in an effort to convince villagers that the U.S. military operation had killed them. The official said he did not know who drove the trucks -- other Taliban or local Afghans forced into duty. ""No one is disputing people died, it's how they died,"" the official said. ""What we do have is strong evidence to support that a number of women and children were killed by the Taliban and their bodies were driven by locals as evidence of U.S. bombing,"" the official said. Some Afghan civilians may have been killed or wounded before the airstrikes during ground fighting between the Taliban and Afghanistan and U.S. forces, the official said. But the military's investigation found no evidence of large-scale civilian deaths resulting from the airstrikes themselves, despite the claims from Afghan officials and the Red Cross. U.S. military investigators found no evidence of human remains in any of the four bomb craters it examined, the official said. The news comes as Afghan President Hamid Karzai visits Washington this week. Karzai and his Pakistani counterpart, President Asif Ali Zardari, are talking with key congressional leaders and policymakers ahead of meetings with President Obama and Clinton. Speaking in Washington, Clinton  -- flanked by Karzai and Zardari -- said the United States and Afghanistan will jointly investigate the airstrike and its aftermath. She said Washington already has sent a team of investigators to the region. The ICRC team found dozens of dead bodies in two villages, spokeswoman Jessica Barry in Kabul, told CNN. The increase of international troops in Afghanistan has raised a concern that fighting will intensify and civilians will face greater risks of getting hurt, she said. ""It's all sides who need to respect the civilians,"" Barry said. ""And this is the message we pass to all the armed forces, to the international forces, to the Taliban, to the armed opposition.""

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- While violence decreases across Iraq, women in the war-ravaged country face worsening hardships as warfare has thrust them into the role of family breadwinners, an aid group's survey said. An Iraqi woman who sells incense and candles to support her children says, ""to work is to preserve your honor."" In a release dated Sunday coinciding with International Women's Day, Oxfam International issued, ""In Her Own Words: Iraqi Women Talk About Their Greatest Concerns and Challenges."" Many women have been widowed and have had to run their families because their husbands ""had been killed, disappeared, abducted or suffered from mental or physical abuse,"" the survey says. As a result, many have been unable to earn a decent living. While there are no precise numbers, there are now an estimated 740,000 widows in Iraq, Oxfam says. ""Women are the forgotten victims of Iraq,"" said Oxfam International Executive Director Jeremy Hobbs, in quotes included in the survey.  See pictures of women working in Iraq » . The survey found that largely because of the conflict in Iraq, 35.5 percent of participants were acting as head of the household and that ""nearly 25 percent had not been married."" ""If this reflects Iraq as a whole, it is the highest rate in the larger region, a result of the loss of men of marrying age as a result of the conflict,"" the survey said. Oxfam and its Iraqi partner group Al-Amal Association, conducted the survey in five provinces -- Baghdad, Basra, Tameem, Najaf and Nineveh. Questioners interviewed 1,700 respondents starting last summer. While the survey doesn't represent the situation facing all Iraqis, it provides ""a disturbing snapshot of many women's lives and those of their children and other family members."" ""A quarter of the women interviewed still do not have daily access to water, a third cannot send their children to school and, since the war started, over half have been the victim of violence,"" Hobbs said. ""And to add further insult more than three-quarters of widows, many of whom lost their husbands to the conflict, get no government pension which they are entitled to."" The report urges Iraq to invest in social welfare essential services. ""A whole generation of Iraqis are at risk. Mothers are being forced to make tough choices, such as whether to pay for their children to go to school and receive health care, or to pay for private power and water services. These are choices no mother should have to make. And they are not only threatening individual families, they are also threatening the future of Iraq itself,"" Hobbs said. Here are some of the survey results. • Security and safety are the top concerns of nearly 60 percent of women. • More than 40 percent of respondents said their security situation worsened last year. • 55 percent had been victims of violence since 2003. • Some 45 percent of women said their income was worse in 2008 than in 2007 and 2006. • 69 percent said access to water was worse or the same as in in 2006 and 2007. • 80 percent said access to electricity was more difficult than or the same as in 2007. • Nearly half of the women said access to quality health care was more difficult in 2008 compared with 2006 and 2007. • 40 percent of women with children reported that their sons and daughters were not attending school.","An estimated 740,000 widows struggle in new roles as heads of house, survey says .

"(CNN) -- North Korea vowed Wednesday that it ""will take every necessary measure to protect its sovereignty"" in the midst of 12-day U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises. South Korean soldiers move into a building during a joint military exercise with U.S. troops in Pocheon Tuesday. ""These war exercises were kicked off by the U.S. and the South Korean puppet war-like forces across South Korea at a time when the inter-Korean relations have reached the worst phase and the situation has grown so tense that a war may break out (at) any moment due to the reckless policy of confrontation pursued by the South Korean conservative authorities,"" North Korea's official KCNA news agency said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When the final whistle blew after Iraq's 4-0 win over Palestine at the Al-Shaab Stadium it was abundantly clear this was not just any international friendly. Iraq's first international match in Baghdad was a special moment for the country's football fans. Supporters spilled out on to the streets to celebrate not just the goals from Hawar Mullah Mohammed, Karrar Jasim, Ala Abdel Zahra and Emad Mohammed, but the fact Iraq had staged their first international match in Baghdad since 2002. Iraq fan Sadiq Alwohal believes it was a poignant moment in the history of the game in the country. To put it simply; football in Iraq had come home. Alwohal fled Baghdad for England 14 years ago to pursue his love of football, where he eventually found work as a coach in London. He now runs the Football for Change program which, among other projects, has set up soccer schools in post-war Iraq. ""It is really special day that we are able to play a match in the capital city in our home stadium -- I believe this is big progress for football in Iraq,"" Alwohal told CNN. ""You could see from the faces of the people and the celebrations after the match how important it was. Football has the potential to help heal the wounds of what has happened in Iraq and the reaction of people shows what it means. ""Now we need to develop the infrastructure in Iraq well so that we have better facilities, so grounds are brought up to the required standard and football can progress. ""For Iraqi people, football is religion -- we are all crazy for it -- and I hope that this match is the dawn of a beautiful new era for the game in Iraq."" Indeed the foundations for the next stage also seem to be coming into place. The Iraq Ministry for Youth and Sport has plans for the construction of a new FIFA International quality stadium in Basra as a location to host the 21st Gulf Cup in 2012. See a video of the plans for the new stadium. But Simon Freeman, author of Baghdad FC, which tells the story of Iraqi footballers who lived under the reign of Saddam Hussein and is an expert on the game in the country, admitted that the match maybe a milestone in the country's development, but there is still much work to be done. Can football help heal Iraq? Leave your comments in the Sound Off box below. ""Obviously this match is important because when sporting fixtures make a return to country -- or city -- blighted by war it does tend to suggest that progress is being made there,"" he said. ""But it a very small step and there could be a temptation to overplay the significance of the game against Palestine. It's an encouraging sign but there have been false dawns before so I don't think people should get too carried away. ""There is still a very long way to go before Iraq returns to something like normality so while it's great news that the game has gone ahead, I'd be inclined to exercise caution."" The impact of the organization of the match though has not been lost on the Asian Football Confederation who have subsequently approved a proposal by Iraq Football Association president Hussein Saeed to lift the sanction imposed on it from hosting the international games. Citing successful organization of friendly games against Palestine as an example of a safe and secure Iraq, the Asian Cup holders will now host home matches for the national team and club teams in the city of Arbil. ""We are glad to be the first sports federation of Iraq to host official international matches of national teams at home after the war,"" Saeed told the AFC Web site. ""We had asked for approval of Baghdad, Arbil and Sulaimanyia venues but AFC has only approved Arbil as a first step. We will continue to press for the approval of the remaining two cities. ""Football plays an important role in the lives of the Iraqi people and they are waiting anxiously to watch their national team play the official international matches at home.""","Iraq football fans celebrate first international match in Baghdad since 2003 .

"(CNN)  -- At the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics Juan Antonio Samaranch, the International Olympic Committee president, declared that the Games had been the best ever. Freeman celebrates after winning gold in the 400 meters. Superbly organized and featuring a record 10,651 athletes, Sydney produced a number of memorable moments, such as Steve Redgrave's fifth consecutive rowing gold and the three golds and two silvers taken by Ian Thorpe in the swimming events. But one performer stood out above all others: Australia's Cathy Freeman. Every Olympics produces one unique individual who somehow comes to define those Games: Jesse Owens in 1936, Emil Zatopek in 1952, Nadia Comaneci in 1976. In 2000 it was the aboriginal Freeman, whose lighting of the Olympic flame and subsequent victory in the 400 meters were of huge symbolic significance to a nation still wrestling with the legacy of its maltreatment of its indigenous peoples. Freeman was already an Australian sporting icon prior to Sydney 2000, having won two gold medals at the 1994 Commonwealth Games (for 200 meters and 400 meters), and back-to-back 400 meters gold medals at the 1997 and 1999 world championships (as well as a 400 meters silver medal at the 1996 Olympics). It wasn't simply her athletic prowess that had made her a national heroine, however (in 1998 she was named Australian of the year), but the fact that she was one of the very few native aborigines to achieve success, sporting or otherwise, in a country that until 1962 had refused to even allow aborigines the right to vote. Although she was never an overt political activist, preferring to make her statement on the running track, Freeman was nonetheless deeply proud of her heritage, and made a point, whenever she won an international race, of carrying not just the Australian flag but the aboriginal one as well on her lap of honor. Powerful statement . Her choice as the person to light the Olympic flame at the Sydney 2000 opening ceremony -- the last in a relay of Australia's great Olympians, and the first time in Olympic history a participating athlete had been given the honor -- was seen as a powerful statement of national contrition and reconciliation. If her role in the opening ceremony was replete with symbolism, however, it was just a prelude to the events of 10 nights later when, in the most eagerly anticipated contest of the Games, Freeman lined up in lane six of Stadium Australia for the 400 meters final. Wearing a hooded green and yellow bodysuit, and cheered on hysterically by a sell-out crowd of 110,000 people -- not to mention the tens of millions glued to their television sets worldwide -- she paced herself perfectly through the race, crossing the finishing line in a time of 49.11 seconds to take the gold medal, ahead of Lorraine Graham of Jamaica and Britain's Katharine Merry. So intense had been the pressure she was under, and so enormous the weight of expectation resting on her shoulders, that, once the race was over, she could do nothing but sit down on the track and hang her head, physically and emotionally exhausted. ""I was totally overwhelmed,"" she later said. ""I could feel the crowd totally around me, all over me. I just felt everybody's emotion and happiness and joy. I was totally absorbing it into every pore in my body. I just had to sit down."" Her victory was not simply a great sporting achievement, but a defining moment of modern Australian history, the entire country united in jubilation at a performance that seemed to hold out hope for a less divided, more racially inclusive society. When she had finally recovered herself Freeman came to her feet again and, holding the Australian and Aboriginal flags above her head, set off on a lap of honor, the stadium echoing to the sound of the chanting of her name. ""Her victory was one of the great sporting events of our generation,"" said Australian Prime Minister John Howard. ""She is a great Australian."" ""All I know is that I made a lot of people happy from a lot of backgrounds who call Australia home,"" was Freeman's assessment of her achievement. She retired from athletics in July 2003.","she was one of the very few native aborigines to achieve success .

"On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. This week, King traveled to Georgia to learn about the toll military service is taking on two veterans. Chris Tucker, who served three tours in Iraq, suffers from hearing, back, foot problems and still has nightmares. SAVANNAH, Georgia (CNN) -- As his tank rolled into Baghdad in April 2003, Chris Tucker mounted his camera to capture the moment. ""It's history; we made history,"" he told CNN back then. ""It's my first war, hopefully my last war."" He could not have imagined then that six years later, Iraq would still be a combat zone. ""I thought we would get there quick and handle our business and we'd be out,"" Tucker told us this week. ""At least, that's what we were told anyway."" Tucker received a medical discharge from the Army last year and he now is Officer Chris Tucker of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department. ""You still get to serve your community and your country in other ways,"" he said. At age 26, he is a veteran of three combat tours. The patrol skills he learned on the streets of Baghdad, Fallujah and Sadr City come in handy as he drives his police cruiser around the neighborhoods of his Savannah precinct. ""Some people -- you will be moving around the corner and they will just run,"" Tucker said as he drove his cruiser. ""And you can tell they are favoring one side -- maybe they have a gun."" He loves his new job, and the joys of fatherhood. His daughter Callie was born three months ago. iReport.com: Send your salute to troops . ""So my life is slowing down,"" Tucker said. ""But I enjoy the slow pace."" But he hasn't left it all behind. As the war hits the six-year mark, Tucker is part of a history -- and a legacy -- still being written as the military tries to better understand the depth of the damage to those exposed repeatedly to the violence. ""I still have the nightmares and wake up and find myself downstairs and I don't know how I got there,"" Tucker said. ""I still see and dream the same things. ... Faces. Kids' faces. People that you have engaged or you have had contact with. ... You see your colleagues blown up. Things like that."" He left the Army with a sour taste. He was sent back for his third tour despite the nightmares, depression, major hearing loss and painful injuries to his back and both feet. Then, the Army decided to give him a medical discharge for his back issues even though Tucker believes he could have recovered with rehabilitation. But he tries not to dwell on his frustration. ""I try to distance myself from it as much as I can, because for me, the more I think about it, the more I reflect on what happened and what we did, the more I think the dreams and the nightmares actually come back."" Tucker is as tired of the Iraq war as anyone, but his experience tells him things can suddenly take a turn for the worse, and so he is skeptical of President Obama's promise to get most combat troops out of Iraq by August 2010.  Watch former VP Cheney discuss Iraq war strategy » . ""I think we are in too deep to pull out,"" Tucker said. ""You can't just commit the way we committed and then say, 'OK, we are done.' ... Politics should not be involved in the way the war is handled."" There will be no more tours for Tucker, but a colleague on the Savannah-Chatham force will soon deploy for his first Iraq tour, and is being ribbed around the precinct, by Tucker and others, as ""the grandpa going off to war."" Police Cpl. Randy Powell is 50 years old and became a grandfather just last week.  Watch Tucker and Powell tell their stories » . Powell served nearly 20 years ago in the Persian Gulf War, then in 1992 took an early retirement package when the Army was downsizing after the war. The deal required him to stay on what the military calls the IRR -- the Individual Ready Reserve -- but even as troops were sent to Afghanistan after 9/11 and then to Iraq for repeat combat tours, Powell heard nothing. Then last year, nearly 15 years after leaving the military, he was told to report to a local Reserve center. Another request came in January of this year. Both times, after some perfunctory paperwork, Powell was sent home. But when he returned home from work one day last month, an overnight letter from the Army had arrived with orders that he was being activated for an Iraq deployment. First, starting next month, he'll have refresher training on radar systems at Fort Jackson in South Carolina. ""They're kind of shocked,"" Powell said of his family. But there are no complaints from Powell -- to the contrary. ""I still feel I am fully capable of being a soldier,"" he told us outside at his police precinct. ""Once a soldier, always a soldier.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Taliban fighters killed two workers from Afghanistan's main election body in another attack that highlighted the threat of a violence-marred parliamentary election Saturday. The attack occurred in a remote district of Afghanistan's northern Balkh province Wednesday morning, said Munir Ahmmad Farhad, a spokesman for the provincial governor. The death toll for campaign staff and election workers in the run-up to the vote now stands at 21, according to Tabish Forugh of Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission. Another 26 people have been wounded. The Taliban has threatened to target polling stations during the voting. Security is one of the election commission's biggest concerns, Forugh said. Of the 6,835 polling centers, the commission has ordered 1,030 closed due to security threats. Polls in only nine of Afghanistan's 34 provinces will be fully open Saturday. Afghanistan's interior ministry announced it will deploy 52,000 police, soldiers and national security officers on election day. They will be complemented by troops from Afghanistan's NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. ""Every vote cast by an Afghan in these elections ... is a perfect statement against the Taliban,"" said ISAF spokesman Brig. Gen. Josef Blotz at a news conference Thursday. ""Every time someone votes in a polling station, the Taliban loses."" Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul on Thursday issued a new warning of potential violence surrounding the elections. It alerted U.S. citizens to avoid crowds and public gatherings and said some road closures and checkpoints at polling stations are to be expected. And the United Nations encouraged international employees not involved with supporting the election to take leave during the polling. Elsewhere, an international forces service member shot a protester who aimed his AK-47 toward a guard tower at a NATO military base in southern Afghanistan, military officials said Thursday. The man was pulled away by fellow demonstrators before ISAF forces were able to determine his condition. The protest of about 100 Afghans at Forward Operating Base Mirwais was reported to have been held in response to an alleged Quran burning inside the base Wednesday. But ISAF said the suspected burning was a routine burn-pit session in which military documents are destroyed. The protest turned violent when the Afghans began throwing rocks at the base guards. ISAF said the armed protester was shot in accordance with the rules of engagement. Also in southern Afghanistan, two international service members were killed Thursday in a bombing and an insurgent attack. No other information, including the service members' nationalities, was immediately available from ISAF. CNN's Ivan Watson and Matiullah Mati contributed to this report.","An attack on electoral workers highlights security problems ahead of Saturday's vote .

"(CNN)  -- In the history of the modern Olympics few, if any, performances have captured the popular imagination in quite the same way as that of American Jesse Owens at the 1936 Berlin Games. Owens defied Hitler by winning four gold medals in Berlin in 1936. His haul of four gold medals -- in the 100 meters, 200 meters, long jump and 4x100 meters relay -- would have been a notable achievement under any circumstances, especially since two of his victories resulted in new world records. What gave his feat its unique resonance, however, was the fact that it took place at a Games organized by Hitler's Nazi Party, and specifically designed as a showcase for white Aryan talent. As a black man, Owens' quadruple triumph was a huge embarrassment to the hosts, and a defiant snub to the Third Reich's theories of white racial supremacy. No other sporting performance before or since has achieved quite the same level of symbolism. The 11th Olympiad had been awarded to Germany in May 1931, two years before Hitler and his Nazi party came to power. Their overtly racist policies -- including the exclusion of all Jews and gypsies from German sporting facilities -- led to widespread calls to either move or boycott the competition, especially in Europe and the U.S. Despite that the Games went ahead, with 49 countries and a total of 4,066 athletes participating, more than in any previous Olympics. From the outset the Nazi propaganda machine made the most of the opportunity presented by the Games. For their two-week duration -- from August 1-16 -- houses and monuments throughout Berlin were decked with Nazi flags and banners, while posters and magazine spreads lauded the ideal of the white Aryan athlete, making an overt link between the racial purity of modern Teutonic culture and that of classical Greece. Director Leni Riefenstahl -- dubbed ""Hitler's film-maker"" -- was employed to capture the anticipated German triumphs on camera. At the same time stringent efforts were made to play down the darker aspects of Nazi ideology, including the removal from Berlin's streets of all anti-Jewish signs, and an order that foreign nationals were not to be subject to Germany's oppressive anti-homosexual laws. Nazi showcasing . It was against this background of tightly regimented Nazi showcasing that, on August 3, Owens started competing in Berlin's 100,000-seater Olympic Stadium, winning his first gold medal in the 100 meters (equaling the Olympic record with his time of 10.3 seconds). Over the next six days he would take a further three golds, in the process setting two new world records -- for the 200 meters and 4x100 meter relay -- and incensing the Nazi authorities (Joseph Goebbels, the minister for propaganda, privately described his victories as ""a disgrace""). The Owens myth is admittedly not quite as clear-cut as it has sometimes been presented. German spectators were open in their admiration for the American, and he would probably have not won the long jump gold had it not been for advice given to him by his main rival in the event, the star German athlete Luz Long. His place in the 4x100 meter relay team, meanwhile, was only secured when American team managers dropped two Jewish athletes -- Marty Gluckman and Sam Stoller -- allegedly at the behest of Hitler himself. Claims that the latter refused to shake hands with Owens were also unfounded -- the German leader had been told at the start of the Games that he should either shake every athlete's hand or none, and had chosen the latter option. Despite that, and the fact that Germany still came top of the overall medal standings, the domination of a black athlete at a Games so overtly dedicated to promoting the ideal of Aryan physical perfection proved hugely symbolic for, and satisfying to a world increasingly alarmed at the activities of the Third Reich. There is a depressing coda to the Owens story, however, for the hero of the Berlin Games subsequently returned home to an America that was itself tainted by profound racial discrimination. Although he received a New York ticker-tape parade, he was snubbed by President Roosevelt, and, because of his color, failed to attract the commercial sponsorship deals awarded to his fellow white athletes. As Owens himself commented: ""Although I wasn't invited to shake hands with Hitler, I wasn't invited to the White House to shake hands with the President either.""","Hitler's Nazi Party designed the Games as a showcase for white Aryan talent .

"(CNN) -- The modern Olympics have, in their 104-year history, seen the setting, and breaking, of numerous world records. Beamon's 1968 long jump world record held until 1991. Most of these pass virtually unnoticed; a few briefly make the headlines and are then forgotten; a very few involve performances of such unique physical prowess they transcend the Games in which they occur and pass into sporting folklore. Abebe Bikila's barefoot marathon in 1960, Nadia Comaneci's perfect 10 at the 1976 Montreal Games, Michael Johnson's 200-meter run at Atlanta in 1996 -- all belong in the latter category. In terms of sheer sporting achievement, however, few if any feats can compare with the record-shattering leap that won American Bob Beamon the long jump gold medal in Mexico City in 1968. Before Beamon started his run-up the world record -- held jointly by Ralph Boston of the U.S. and the Soviet Union's Igor Ter-Ovanesyan -- stood at 27 feet 4 3/4 inches (8.35 meters). Six seconds later that record had been increased by a staggering 21 3/4 inches (55.25 centimeters), to 29 feet 2 1/2 inches (8.90 meters). In long-jumping terms it was the equivalent of the marathon time being reduced by 30 minutes, or the 100 meters by a full second. No wonder Ter-Ovanesyan declared: ""Compared to this jump we are as children."" Troubled childhood . Born in New York in 1946, Beamon experienced a troubled, tragedy-filled childhood. He never knew his real father, his mother Naomi died of tuberculosis when he was just eight months old and, because his stepfather was in prison at the time, he ended up being raised by his maternal grandmother. From an early age he became involved in New York's drug and gang culture, getting himself expelled from school for hitting a teacher and serving time in a juvenile detention center. ""For most of my childhood it was just more or less survival,"" he later commented. ""I was hanging out with thugs and the whole nine yards."" Sport offered him a way out of this spiral of violence and deprivation. Encouraged by a series of inspirational teachers he devoted himself increasingly to athletics -- ""I got off the corner and into the community center,"" as he later put it -- and was soon setting city-wide, and then national records for long jump, culminating in his Olympic team selection in 1968. His preparations for the Games were seriously disrupted when, four months before their opening, he was suspended from his university track team for refusing to compete against Brigham Young University, a Mormon college with then-segregationist policies. The suspension left him without a coach, and it was only when existing long-jump world record holder Ralph Boston agreed to coach him unofficially that he was able to resume normal training. Once in Mexico the six-foot three-inch (1.91 meters) Beamon very nearly didn't make it into the long jump final after fouling in two of his qualifying jumps. He just scraped through with his third jump, and the following day, October 18, 1968, lined up for the final alongside the cream of world long-jumping: Boston, Ter-Ovanesyan and Lynn Davis of Wales, holder of the Olympic, European and Commonwealth records. The three record-holders all fouled their first jump. Determined to gain the psychological advantage Beamon paused at the start of the run-up track, took a deep breath and launched himself down the approach. Nineteen strides later he hit the board and took off, coming down again so far along the sandpit that the jump was out of the range of the electronic measuring eye and officials had to use an old-fashioned measuring tape to judge the distance. As the stadium waited for the result one veteran sports commentator was heard to say: ""Gentlemen, I believe we have just witnessed the first 28-foot long jump in history."" His prediction proved to be an underestimate. When the official length was finally announced it turned out to be the first 29-foot long jump in history -- 29 feet 2 1/2 inches (8.90 meters) to be precise. Cataplectic seizure . Reigning Olympic champion Lynn Davis turned to Ralph Boston and said: ""I can't go on. What's the point?"" Beamon himself was so stunned by the distance that he collapsed to the ground in what doctors later diagnosed as a cataplectic seizure brought on by nervous excitement. The competition continued, but the size of Beamon's first jump made the result a foregone conclusion. The silver medal was eventually taken by East Germany's Klaus Beer and the bronze by Boston. The result sent shockwaves through the athletics world. Although there were those who disparaged Beamon's achievement, claiming it was assisted by Mexico City's high altitude, the fact was that all the long jump finalists were competing under the same conditions and none of them came close to Beamon (Klaus Beer's silver medal jump was 2 feet 4 inches -- 71 centimeters -- shorter). It was, altitude or not, quite simply one of the greatest feats in the history of athletics, and one that turned the former New York delinquent into a sporting icon. Beamon himself would never again match or surpass that jump, and it was not until 23 years later that Mike Powell of the U.S. broke the record by two inches (5 centimeters) at the 1991 World Athletics Championships in Tokyo. Beamon was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 1983, and in 1999 published his autobiography. It was, with some justification, titled ""The Man Who Could Fly.""","Long jumper, Bob Beamon flies into the history books in Mexico City .

"Here is Travis Stanton's response to comments on the essay he wrote after learning his father was going to become a woman. Friday night my dad came down from Lake Worth to watch Her Name Was Steven -- the CNN documentary about him -- with our family and some friends. It meant a lot to me and my mother that my dad was down at our house, in the room much less where all of this first happened. My dad, my mother, some neighborhood friends and my girlfriend Ashlee all sat down Saturday night to watch it. We all loved it. The next day my dad showed me some of the comments on the CNN web site about the essay I wrote about him in 8th grade for a school project. These comments were some of the nicest things I've read about myself in my life. As people saw my posting, they started asking me some questions. I started answering them. One good question was: ""How did my schoolmates react to all of this? Were they supportive or negative towards this? "" Well, the night my dad told me about his plans to become a woman was also the same night that the news stations found out and aired the story. Surprisingly to my parents, I decided to go to school the next day. I went to a small school at the time. It was a school with grades 4-8 and had about 300 kids total. I was in the 8th grade. As I got dropped off, before I could even walk in the school, some teachers and a bunch of my friends came running out to hug me and say it's going to be okay. I was still in shock from all of this, but I'm pretty good at hiding my emotions. Unfortunately having all of your friends hugging you and knowing about this brought out some tears. All of my 8th grade friends knew about this, and mostly all of them were supportive. Now I'm in the 10th grade at high school with about 3000 students, so it's a bit different. When I started high school, the story of my dad had kind of settled down. I've not really gotten any support from my new high school friends because we don't talk about it. I've been asked a few times if Susan Stanton was related to me and I say, ""Yes, that's my dad."" Other than about three of those little ""are-you-related"" questions from people I partially knew, I haven't been approached by any kids at school. Yes, some people tell me that my dad is kind of weird and I completely agree. When you truly love someone you learn to accept the choices they make. It's no different if your mom said, ""I am going to shave off all my hair."" Would you stop loving her because of that? Hopefully not. This is the same thing with my dad, but its i obviously a little more than a haircut. One of the comments that I read was that it was selfish for my dad to use the money on his surgery. Was it selfish of my dad? Absolutely -- 100 percent -- not. If you had those feelings, I am sure all of us would do the same thing. It would be almost rude to live the rest of his life in pain knowing he wasn't himself and not truly who he felt he was. Money was always a problem ever since my dad got fired. Like I said in the documentary, the biggest negative change that impacted our family was dad losing his job. I know that if we were really down to the last dollars we had, my dad would not have done the surgery until we got back on our feet. Both of my parents are really financially smart and we have planned ahead to live a comfortable life. The more important part is me and my mom still live in our house. I've lived in this house since I was a baby and I can't imagine having to move. In conclusion, I would like to thank everyone who read my essay. The comments I read about myself are some of the nicest things I have ever read about me. I love the feedback that I get, good or bad.

"(CNN) -- Italian champions Inter Milan had to come from two goals down to earn a point at Bari on Saturday night in a match featuring three penalties. The 2-2 draw put Inter nine points clear of city rivals AC Milan, who have played two fewer matches ahead of Sunday's home clash with Siena. After a goalless first half, Bari took the lead on the hour when visiting defender Walter Samuel handled a shot by former Inter youth player Riccardo Meggiorini, allowing Barreto to score from the spot. The Brazilian, on loan from Udinese, repeated the feat three minutes later when Alessandro Parisi went down under a challenge from Lucio to give ninth-placed Bari hope of an upset victory. But Inter pulled a goal back in the 69th minute as new signing Goran Pandev scored his first for the Nerazzurri, and his 50th in Serie A, with a close-range effort. Argentina striker Diego Milito then earned Inter a point from the penalty spot five minutes later after former Lazio forward Pandev was tripped by Leonardo Bonucci. Meggiorini had a chance to score a late winner against his old club, but shot just wide. Cagliari moved up to sixth place, ahead of Fiorentina and Palermo on goal difference, after beating Livorno 3-0 at home. Joaquin Larrivey scored early in each half, while substitute Jeda netted in the 64th minute, as the Sardinians moved to within three points of third-placed Napoli, who host Palermo on Sunday while Fiorentina are at home to Bologna. In Germany, Bayer Leverkusen returned to the top of the Bundesliga table with a 4-2 victory at home to Mainz. Leverkusen moved two points clear of Bayern Munich, who had taken top spot for the first time since May 2008 with a 2-0 win at home to Hoffenheim on Friday night. Hamburg moved up to third with a 2-0 victory at home to Freiburg on Saturday, while Schalke can climb to second with victory at home to second-bottom Nuremberg on Sunday. Leverkusen remained unbeaten with 38 points from 18 matches despite going behind in the eighth minute to Tim Hoogland's goal. The hosts hit back with Michal Kadlec, Tranquillo Barnetta and Toni Kroos scoring inside half an hour, while Eren Derdiyok sealed victory for Jupp Heynckes' side with two minutes to go after Niko Bungert gave Mainz hope on 67. Hamburg moved to within two points of Bayern, and above Schalke on goal difference, as Marcell Jansen and Mladen Petric scored in each half against Freiburg, who hover just above the relegation zone. Defending champions Wolfsburg crashed 3-1 at Stuttgart, who  moved out of the bottom three and up to 12th place. Sixth-placed Werder Bremen lost 1-0 at Eintracht Frankfurt, while bottom club Hertha Berlin stunned Hannover 3-0 to claim their second win this season. Bochum eased their relegation worries with a 2-1 win at mid-table Borussia Moenchengladbach.","Serie A leaders Inter Milan come from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw at Bari .

"(CNN) -- As an event attracting worldwide attention and mass media coverage, it is perhaps not surprising that the Olympics have, over the course of their history, served as a platform for all manner of political statements and protests. From the Nazis' manipulation of the 1936 Berlin Games to promote the myth of white Aryan supremacy, through to Cathy Freeman's iconic parading of the aboriginal flag at Sydney 2000, politics and the Olympics have never been too far apart, despite the best efforts of the International Olympic Committee to keep the competition rigorously neutral. Of all the many occasions on which the Games have been used as a stage for political dissent, however, few, if any, were as powerful, or as eloquent, as the moment at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics when U.S. athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos stood on the winner's podium and gave a Black Power salute in protest at continued racial oppression in their native America. The action had its roots in the formation the previous year of the Olympic Project for Human Rights (OPHR). Inspired by the growing U.S. Black Power movement, the Project's aim was to encourage black American athletes to boycott the 1968 Games as a means of highlighting American civil rights abuses. As its founding statement declared: ""We must no longer allow this country to use a few so-called Negroes to point out to the world how much progress she has made in solving her racial problems when the oppression of Afro-Americans is greater than it ever was."" Although the boycott itself failed to materialize, the OPHR's ideals were not forgotten by many of the black athletes who went to Mexico City, among them Smith and Carlos, both OPHR members. When both men won medals in the 200 meters -- Smith the gold, Carlos the bronze -- they determined to hold a non-violent protest to draw attention to the plight of their fellow black Americans (the timing was especially poignant since Martin Luther King, the leader of the U.S. Civil Rights movement, had been assassinated only six months previously). Olive branch . The two sprinters took to the winner's podium shoeless, wearing black socks (to represent the poverty of Afro-Americans), black scarves (to symbolize the horror of lynchings) and black gloves (as a mark of black unity and strength). Smith also carried a box containing an olive branch as an emblem of peace. As the American flag was raised and the national anthem played they held up their fists -- Smith his right, Carlos his left -- in a Black Power salute. Beside them silver medallist Peter Norman, a white Australian, sported an OPHR patch in order to show solidarity with their actions. ""I just couldn't salute the flag in the accepted manner,"" Smith later said, ""because it didn't represent me fully, only asking me to be great on the track and then obliging me to come home and be just another nigger."" Although the protest was both dignified and peaceful, it provoked instant outrage among the U.S. athletics authorities. Smith and Carlos were suspended from their national team, stripped of their medals and expelled from the athletes' village. The response back in America was even more hysterical. The Los Angeles Times condemned the athletes for what it described as a 'Nazi-like salute,' while Time Magazine ran a picture of the Olympic logo with the traditional Olympic motto ""Faster, Higher, Stronger"" replaced by the words ""Angrier, Nastier, Uglier."" Both men's families received death threats. If there was anger, however, there was also widespread admiration for the men's courage in daring to defy Olympic protocol. Mohammed Ali described it as ""the single most courageous act of this century,"" while Wyomia Tyus, anchor of the U.S. women's gold-medal winning 4x100 meter relay team, dedicated the team's victory to the two ostracized sprinters. Despite that, both men's athletics careers were badly damaged by their protest. Although his 200-meters winning time set a new world record that was to stand for 11 years Smith never ran for the U.S. again, and was eventually forced to give up athletics and turn to American football instead. Carlos was also cold-shouldered by the U.S. sporting establishment, and for years struggled to land a proper job . Neither, however, have any regrets about their iconic protest. ""I had no regrets, I have no regrets, I will never have any regrets,"" Smith said. ""We were there to stand up for human rights and to stand up for black Americans. We wanted to make them better in the United States.''","U.S. sprinters Carlos and Smith stand up for civil rights in 1968 in Mexico City .

"(CNN) -- Milan legend Paolo Maldini played his final match in front of his San Siro fans on Sunday, but Roma spoiled the celebrations by claiming a shock 3-2 defeat. Maldini salutes the crowd on his lap of honor as his San Siro career ends in a 3-2 defeat by Roma. The 40-year-old Maldini made his debut for the club in 1985 as a 16-year-old and he was awarded an emotional lap of honor despite the match result. Roma took a first-half lead when Norwegian defender lashed home a fierce shot after David Pizarro rolled a free-kick into his path -- and the scoreline remained the same until an explosive final 15 minutes. Milan levelled in the 75th minute when Roma goalkeeper Artur saved Filippo Inzaghi's shot from Kaka's cross -- and Massimo Ambrosini swept home the loose ball. But just five minutes later Roma were back in front as Jeremy Menez twisted and turned in the area before shooting across Dida into the far corner. That lead lasted only a minute as Ambrosini was left unmarked at the back post to turn home Kaka's cross for his second of the game. But Roma came back again and they took the lead for the third time when captain Francesco Totti thumped home a free-kick with five minutes to play. Milan and Juventus are now level on points in second position, but Juve lead on their head-to head after a 3-0 victory at Siena, their first win in eight matches. Both teams are guaranteed Champions League football and are 10 points behind champions Inter Milan with just one match remaining, despite Jose Mourinho's side going down 2-1 at Cagliari. Meanwhile, a last-minute Martin Jorgensen goal earned fourth-placed Fiorentina, who will go into the Champions League qualifiers, a 1-1 draw at Lecce -- a result that relegates the home side to Serie B. Lecce join already relegated Reggina in the second tier. They will be joined by either Bologna, who drew 0-0 against Chievo, or Torino -- who lost 3-2 against Genoa -- in losing their top flight status.","Paolo Maldini plays his final match at the San Siro as Milan lose 3-2 to Roma .

"(CNN)  -- AC Milan kept up the pressure on Serie A table-toppers and city rivals Inter Milan with a 3-0 win at Juventus on Sunday night -- a result which turns the heat firmly on home coach Ciro Ferrara. Alessandro Nesta put Milan ahead in the 29th minute with Ronaldinho adding a 72nd minute second as Juve struggled to produce a display that would ease the calls for Ferrara's head. Another goal from Ronaldinho two minutes from time came amid protests from the home fans, who shrouded the field with smoke by burning any item possible, and sealed the win for Milan, who move within eight points of Inter with a game in hand. Napoli remain firmly in the hunt for Champions League football after substitute German Denis came off the bench to score the winner against Sampdoria. Denis headed home after 71 minutes to move Napoli on to 33 points in fourth place and extend their unbeaten run to 12 points. Livorno eased their fears of relegation with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Parma at the Stadio Armando Picchi. Francesco Tavano gave the home side the lead midway through the first period and veteran forward Cristiano Lucarelli doubled their advantage 17 minutes into the second half. Blerim Dzemaili pulled one back for Parma six minutes later but Livorno held on as Francesco Guidolin's side ran out of steam. Substitute Jose Castillo struck the winning goal for Fiorentina as the Viola came from behind against Bari to prevail 2-1 and climb to sixth in Serie A. Castillo struck the winner in the 74th minute but he was shown a red card 10 minutes from time, with Bari's Sergio Almiron already dismissed for two bookings. Fiorentina striker Adrian Mutu had earlier cancelled out Paulo Barreto's 25th minute opener. Genoa jumped above city rivals Sampdoria in the table thanks to a routine 2-0 win over 10-man Catania at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris. The home side struggled to get into the game until Giuseppe Bellusci was sent off for the visitors in the 28th minute. Genoa went ahead through Giandomenico Mesto in the 36th minute with Giuseppe Sculli sealing their win in the 71st minute before Catania coach Sinisa Mihajlovic was also sent to the stands. Alessandro Matri struck the winner as Cagliari won their first away fixture since October 29, edging strugglers Bologna 1-0 at the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara. Palermo extended their unbeaten league run to five games with Edinson Cavani scoring the only goal against Atalanta from the penalty spot. Udinese halted a worrying run of defeats but could not claim all three points as Lazio held on for a point with a 1-1 draw at the Stadio Friuli. Gianni De Biasi's side went into the game having lost five of their last six games following their midweek defeat by Bari and got off to another miserable start as Sergio Floccari put Lazio ahead after 16 minutes. But Antonio Di Natale's free-kick levelled matters 11 minutes later and neither side could find a second.","AC Milan keep up the pressure on Serie A table-toppers and city rivals Inter Milan .

"(CNN) -- Roma moved up to sixth place in the Serie A table after a 1-0 victory in the Rome 'derby' against city rivals Lazio. Substitute full-back Marco Cassetti scored the only goal in the 79th minute, finding the corner of the net with a scuffed shot from Mirko Vucinic's cross. Lazio had enjoyed the better of the chances in a tight matchm with Mauro Zarate striking the post on the hour mark -- before Roma goalkeeper Julio Sergio made an instinctive one-handed save from Stefano Mauri's follow-up. Roma were reduced to 10 men in the 88th minute when David Pizarro picked up his second yellow card, but they held on for the victory on a match that was held up for 10 minutes in the first-half because of crowd disturbances. In Sunday's other matches, Jonathan Biabiany scored twice as Parma drew 2-2 away to Genoa to keep hold of fourth in the table. With Italy's top three all playing on Saturday, Parma came into the match in fourth after Sampdoria's 3-0 defeat at AC Milan on Saturday dropped them down to fifth overnight. Rodrigo Palacio initially put Genoa in position to take fourth themselves with a 14th minute opener. But Biabiany struck on 36 and 59 minutes to give Parma the lead before Raffaelle Palladino equalized eight minutes later, leaving Genoa in seventh position. At one point during the afternoon Cagliari, who had won five of their last six matches and beat Juventus 2-0 a week ago, had looked in pole position to go fourth as they led 1-0 at Palermo at halftime through Alessandro Matri. But goals from Igor Budan and Simon Kjaer 10 minutes apart gave Delio Rossi his first win as coach of the Sicilians. Fiorentina moved up to fifth after their 2-0 home win over Atalanta ended their two-match losing streak. Peru international Juan Vargas opened the scoring on 26 minutes with a left-foot rocket from outside the box and Italy forward Alberto Gilardino clinched the victory a minute from time. The race for fourth is now so tight that Parma are only five points above Palermo in 13th place. Napoli extended their unbeaten run since Walter Mazzarri took over from Roberto Donadoni to nine matches in all competitions as Fabio Quagliarella scored a brace, including the winner two minutes from time, in a 3-2 success at home to Bari. Bari led 2-1 after an hour through goals from Paulo Barreto and Andrea Ranocchia but then had Alessandro Parisi dismissed. Cristian Maggio restored parity before Quagliarella's late winner while Bari ended with nine men as Ranocchia also saw red late on.

"(CNN) -- As the decade draws to a close it is time to reflect and reminisce on 10 years of glorious football drama -- and what better way to do this than by paying respect to the characters who have contributed so much to the soccer story that has captivated fans since 2000. Two World Cups -- in South Korea and Japan, and Germany respectively -- provided the grandest of stages for some of the greatest footballers of the era to perform and show off their skills. Aside of the biggest tournament in world football, these talented theatricals of the ball wowed audiences around the globe as they helped their sides, in both international and club arenas, to glory and success. The top stars of soccer have seen their salaries climb to record levels since the turn of the century, a reflection of the drawing power these modern-day entertainers wield, but if a team were to be selected of the eleven best performers, who would be included? Here is the Fanzone select eleven of Noughties soccer heroes -- let Fanzone know what you think by adding your comment at the bottom of the page. 1. Zinedine Zidane: The three-time FIFA World Footballer of the Year (1998, 2000 and 2003) Zidane brilliantly guided his nation France to the European title in 2000. The most famous of the ""Galacticos"", he also inspired Real Madrid to domestic honors and the Champions League title in 2002. His career almost had a fairy tale ending, but an infamous sending off in extra time of the 2006 World Cup final against Italy saw his last game soiled with controversy. 2. David Beckham: The global power of Brand Beckham showed no sign of losing its luster as the decade came to an end as the former England captain remained the highest paid footballer in the world. Super-fit at 34, Beckham continues to keep his place in Fabio Capello's England and holds the record 115 caps for an outfield player. The midfielder won two English Premier League titles with Manchester United, a La Liga title with Real Madrid and the Western Conference with LA Galaxy since the turn of the century. 3. Cristiano Ronaldo: Ronaldo became the most expensive player in football history after his $132 million transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid in 2009, and his early performances for the Spanish giants indicate he is worth every dime. 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year Ronaldo also captains the Portugal national side and won the European Champions League, the Club World Cup and three Premier League titles with United. 4. Marta: Brazil's Marta is a four-time FIFA World Player of the Year and has raised the bar in the women's game by showcasing her talents at Olympic and World Cup level. Marta has scored 54 goals in just 53 appearances for her country and helped them to silver medals in the 2004 and 2008 Olympics. Only 23, surely gold beckons in 2012. 5. Ronaldo: Ronaldo's goal scoring feats with two in the final against Germany helped Brazil to the 2002 World Cup and cemented his reputation as one of the greatest players to wear the green and gold. He is the record scorer in World Cup finals and in club football has averaged nearly a goal a game, notching 87 in 123 appearances for Real Madrid from 2002 - 2007, a statistic which helped Los Meringues capture the La Liga title in 2003. 6. Paolo Maldini: It is testament to Maldini's ability and longevity that he made his final appearance in AC Milan colors in 2009 at the ripe old age of 40. Maldini retired from international football with Italy in 2002 after 126 appearances but he remained one of the best defenders in the world and helped Milan to the Champions League in 2007, his fifth win in Europe's top club competition. The evergreen Italian also notched up a Scudetta title win and Club world Cup win in the same decade. 7. Lionel Messi: Lionel Messi is the newly-crowned FIFA World Player of the Year and his outstanding performances for Barcelona and Argentina made him an almost unanimous choice. The 21-year-old inspired Barca to a Spanish league and cup and Champions League treble, scoring the clinching second in the final against Manchester United. Add to this two other La Liga titles and a European Champions League win in 2005-06 as well as scoring the winning goal to lift the Club World Cup in 2009, it is easy to see why Messi was a must pick. 8. Park ji-Sung: Park ji-Sung was the first Asian to play in the Champions League final when he appeared in Manchester United's 2-0 loss to Barcelona earlier this year. His tireless displays for the English champions marked him down as the finest player from that continent and he has played 84 times for South Korea, helping them to South Africa 2010. The energetic midfielder helped United to three domestic titles and a Champions League trophy in 2008. 9. Luis Figo: Luis Figo began the decade as the most expensive footballer in the world after a controversial move from Barcelona to arch-rivals Real Madrid. His performances for Real and Portugal saw him named European and then World Footballer of the Year in 2000 and 2001. He retired in 2009 having helped Inter Milan to four straight Serie A titles and Real to two league titles and a European Cup win in the preceding decade. 10. Thierry Henry: The French hit man produced the most outstanding displays of his star-studded career during his spell in the English Premier League with Arsenal, scoring 174 goals in 254 games for the Gunners before he transferred to Catalan giants Barcelona in 2007. On the international front, Henry has scored a record 51 goals for France. Since 2000 Henry picked up winners' medals for two Premier League titles, a La Liga title, a Champions League and Club World Cup win. 11. Samuel Eto'o: Inter Milan striker Eto'o is widely acknowledged to have been the most accomplished footballer to emerge from Africa and has helped Cameroon to Olympic gold in 2000 as well as two Africa Cup of Nations triumphs (2000, 2002). Eto'o -- who named African Footballer of the Year in 2003, 2004 and 2005 -- scored 108 goals in 145 games for Barcelona helping the side to three La Liga title wins that culminated in their historic treble in 2009 before being transferred to Inter. The Indomitable Lion is also the official face of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.","Fanzone reflects on the characters who have contributed so much to the soccer story that has captivated fans since 2000 .

Daniel Van Buyten's 82nd-minute winner left Bayern on 13 points behind the two top teams, who are in action on Sunday, and above Hoffenheim and Mainz on goal difference. Mainz won 3-2 away to Bochum on Saturday, while Hoffenheim scored three late goals to snatch a 4-2 victory at Borussia Moenchengladbach. They moved above Schalke, who lost 2-1 to coach Felix Magath's former team, defending champions Wolfsburg, on Friday night. Bayern broke into the top three for the first time this season despite again starting with France star Franck Ribery on the substitutes' bench, where he was joined by Miroslav Klose as young striker Thomas Muller was given the chance to add to his run of four goals in two games. Nuremberg fielded a defensive line-up, but striker Mario Gomez still managed to hit the crossbar for Bayern before Ivica Olic broke the deadlock in the 55th minute. The Croatia forward scored his second goal of the season after being fed in the penalty area by Muller, who was earlier denied one-on-one by goalkeeper Raphael Schafer. The visitors shocked the 69,000-strong crowd in the 73rd minute when Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting equalized after good work by 18-year-old midfielder Ilkay Gundogan. However, Belgian defender Van Buyten followed up his midweek Champions League goal in the win over Maccabi Haifa by heading Arjen Robben's right-wing cross into the far corner to help launch the city's Oktoberfest in fine style. Hoffenheim moved into fourth place on 11 points as Senegalese striker Demba Ba scored in the first minute of injury-time to seal victory over Moenchengladbach. Brazilian midfielder Maicosuel had equalized in the 86th minute and then Nigerian forward Chinedu Obasi put the visitors ahead three minutes later. The hosts had led 2-0 after 17 minutes through Juan Arango and Roberto Colautti, but Sejad Salihovic's free-kick beat goalkeeper Logan Bailly from an impossibly tight angle four minutes later to reduce the deficit. Mainz earned victory at Bochum thanks to a second-half double from 18-year-old striker Andre Schuerle. Midfielder Mimoun Azaouagh put the home side ahead after only seven minutes and striker Diego Fernando Klimowicz doubled the lead at the end of first-half regulation time -- but Andreas Ivanschitz reduced the deficit before the whistle blew for the interval. Schuerle netted in the 52nd and 71st minutes to give Mainz a third win from six league outings. Cologne moved off the bottom of the table with their first victory, winning 2-0 at Stuttgart with a 25th-minute header from Sebastian Freis before goalkeeper Jens Lehmann's 89th-minute error let in striker Manasseh Ishiaku. In Saturday's other game, Hannover were held 1-1 at home by Borussia Dortmund as Didier Ya Konan scored three minutes after halftime for the hosts to cancel out Nuri Sahin's goal just before the break. On Sunday, Hamburg travel to Eintracht Frankfurt, Leverkusen host Werder Bremen and bottom club Hertha Berlin are at home to Freiburg. On Friday, striker Edin Dzeko scored twice to haunt his former mentor Magath as champions Wolfsburg moved onto nine points with a third win of the Bundesliga season. The Bosnian broke the deadlock in the 55th minute with a header from Sascha Riether's cross, but Benedikt Howedes leveled with a header of his own 10 minutes from time from Levan Kenia's corner. However, Dzeko relieved the pressure on coach Armin Veh a minute later to end a run of three defeats as he fired home from eight yards after being set up by substitute Makoto Hasebe. Schalke substitute Kevin Kuranyi had a late header blocked on the line by goalkeeper Andre Lenz, filling in for the suspended Diego Benaglio.","Bayern Munich close to within two points of Bundesliga's top two teams .

"(CNN) -- Coach Luciano Spalletti has parted company with Roma following the Italian club's poor start to the Serie A season, with former Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri replacing him. Luciano Spalletti has ended his four-year tenure at Roma after coming under attack from fans. Speculation had been rife that the 50-year-old Spalletti would quit following Sunday's 3-1 home defeat by Juve, which followed the 3-2 opening day loss to Genoa. Spalletti met with the capital club's president Rosella Sensi on Tuesday morning before confirming his resignation to reporters. ""I offered my resignation and the club has accepted it,"" he said. Roma confirmed on Wednesday that former Juventus, Valencia and Chelsea coach Ranieri would take over ahead of the club's next match against Siena on September 13. He has signed a two-year contract. Ranieri, who began his playing career at Roma in 1973, earlier confirmed that he wanted the job. ""This is a great satisfaction for me,"" he said. ""This is a dream come true as I follow a professional journey that began many years ago. I am honoured and convinced I will be able to do and give the best for Roma."" Spalletti joined Roma in 2005 after guiding unfancied Udinese to fourth place in Serie A and qualification for the Champions League the previous season. He turned around Roma's fortunes, winning two Italian Cups and providing the main opposition for Italian champions Inter Milan following the match-fixing punishments handed out to Juventus and AC Milan. However, last season's sixth placing was the worst of his reign in the Eternal City, and he came under fire from fans after a lack of major summer signings and then the club's poor start to the 2009-10 campaign. Midfielder Alberto Aquilani was sold to English club Liverpool, while defenders Nicolas Burdisso and Marco Motta joined from Inter Milan and Udinese respectively. Roma are drawn with England's Fulham, Swiss side Basle and CSKA Sofia of Bulgaria in Group E of the second-tier Europa League.","Coach Luciano Spalletti has parted company with Italian club Roma .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o has moved a step closer to joining Inter Milan after agreeing personal terms with the Italian champions, his agent has revealed. Prolific striker Samuel Eto'o is on the verge of moving to Serie A with Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan. The Cameroon international will reportedly sign a five-year contract worth almost $15 million per season. Spanish champions Barcelona have already agreed a deal to swap Eto'o for Inter's star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic plus $74 million and the loan of Nou Camp fringe player Aleksander Hleb. Sweden forward Ibrahimovic, who suffered a sprained wrist in Tuesday's defeat by Chelsea, is still negotiating his own terms with the European champions.  Latest transfer rumors and gossip . Eto'o's agent Josep Maria Mesalles told reporters on Thursday that the deal to take the 28-year-old to the San Siro was almost complete. ""It's done. We have reached an agreement with Inter,"" he said. ""Samuel talked to (coach Jose) Mourinho yesterday and is very happy to be wearing the Nerazzurri shirt. All the details have been filed. ""It's complete harmony with us and the club. We are very happy and satisfied. The deal's sealed, next week he will start working with Inter. ""As soon as he signs the contract he will be at Mourinho's disposal."" Eto'o is poised to end what has recently been an acrimonious five-year stay in the Catalan capital. He was the club's top scorer last season with 34 goals, but annoyed the club while being courted by English club Manchester City, leading coach Pep Guardiola to state that it would be best for the club if the player left despite him having been offered a new contract. Two years ago he was criticized by former teammate Ronaldinho after refusing to come on as a late substitute following his recovery from a broken leg. Eto'o will leave the Nou Camp as the fourth highest goalscorer in the club's history, and netted in both finals as Barcelona won the Champions League in 2006 and 2009. On Thursday Barcelona bolstered Guardiola's strike force, announcing an agreement to sign Keirrison from Brazilian club Palmeiras. Barca will pay an initial $20 million for the 20-year-old forward, who will undergo a medical on Friday and sign a five-year contract. Meanwhile, Inter's veteran France midfielder Patrick Vieira will be assessed again this week to determine whether he needs to have surgery. While Ibrahimovic's wrist injury was not as serious as Inter first feared, Vieira may need to have an operation after it was revealed that he had torn a ligament in his left index finger.","Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o agrees reported five-year contract with Inter Milan .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal returned to singles action Wednesday at the Rogers Cup in Montreal but his comeback lasted just 36 minutes as his opponent, David Ferrer, was forced to withdraw with injury. Nadal was on court for just 36 minutes on his singles return. World No. 2 Nadal -- playing his first singles match since losing in the fourth round at the French Open -- was leading 4-3 by a break in the first set of the second round clash when fellow Spaniard Ferrer was forced to quit with a knee injury. Nadal, who had already played two doubles matches this week, said he was happy to be back on the court after spending two months on the sidelines with tendonitis in both knees. ""The first movements is tough and hard to move well and to feel confident when you are touching the ball. But that's the normal thing. I must be happy, because I didn't play terrible,"" said the 23-year-old, according to the ATP's Web site. ""And the next round, I have another chance tomorrow to continuing to improve. Every match, every game is important to feel better for me."" Nadal faces Philipp Petzschner on Thursday after the German eliminated Spanish 15th seed Tommy Robredo 7-6, 7-6.

"(CNN)  -- Roger Federer sent out an ominous message to his rivals by claiming the Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati with a straight sets demolition of Novak Djokovic in the final on Sunday. Federer was getting his hands on his 61st career title after an emphatic win. Federer was playing his second tournament since returning to the ATP Tour circuit after becoming the father of twin girls and was back to his peerless best ahead of the U.S. Open at Flushing Meadow next week. The Swiss maestro swept aside world number two Andy Murray in straight sets in their semifinal match up and afforded Djokovic the same treatment with a 6-1 7-5 victory to claim his 16th Masters crown. Djokovic had played superbly to dispatch former world number one Rafael Nadal in their semifinal and had not dropped a set all week, but had no answer to the world number one. Federer breezed through the opening set, but encountered more resistance in the second, having to save a set point as he served at 4-5 down. But it was saved with a fine service and in the next game he broke Djokovic for the fourth time in the match. Federer duly served out the match to love, claiming his third Cincinnati title as his Serbian opponent netted a return after one hour and 30 minutes. It was his 61st career title. He heads into his defense of the U.S. Open crown having won the last two grand slams at the French Open and Wimbledon to take his tally to a record 15 and as warm favorite. Following his Wimbledon triumph, Federer took an enforced break as his wife Mirka gave birth to Charlene Riva and Myla Rose, but returned to be beaten in the quarterfinals in Montreal by Jo-Wilfred Tsonga. Murray claimed the title, but met his match against a much-improved Federer in Cincinnati.","Roger Federer wins the Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati, Ohio .

"(CNN) -- Italian champions Inter Milan recorded their fifth straight win under new coach Leonardo, defeating Cesena 3-2 at the San Siro despite the visitors coming back from 2-0 down. Samuel Eto'o gave the home side a 14th-minute lead when firing in his 24th goal of the season. And, within a minute, Inter had doubled their advantage when Goran Pandev set up Diego Milito to tap home from just six yards out. But Cesena refused to lie down and scored twice within six minutes in a frantic opening 45 minutes. First, Erjon Bogdani was given far too much space to turn and shoot home low into the corner of the net in the 23rd minute. Then, just six minutes later, Cesena remarkably drew level when former Inter midfielder Luis Suarez played the ball over the home defence for Emanuele Giaccherini to volley home. But the first-half scoring was still not over -- and Romanian defender Christian Chivu put the home side ahead once again on the stroke of half time when he burst into the box to head home Maicon's cross. That was the end of the scoring, but not the chances, and Eto'o should have added his second of the game after the break but somehow managed to hit the crossbar from just eight yards out. And any chance Cesena had of getting back into the game was finally extinguished when Giaccherini was sent off for a second bookable offence. The result moves Inter up to fourth place in the Serie A table, six points behind leaders and rivals AC Milan but with a game in hand. Meanwhile, Roma are through to the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup after beating rivals Lazio 2-1 in a match marred by crowd trouble. Roma took the lead eight minutes after the break when Marco Borriello scored from the penalty spot after Stephan Lichsteiner's handball in the area. Lazio levelled just four minutes later when Hernanes also scored from the spot after Mauro Zarate had been fouled in the area. However, Simplicio scored the winning goal 13 minutes from the end, firing home with a well-struck right-foot shot. Police made four arrests before and after the match after trouble between rival fans which resulted in a teenage Lazio fan being taken to hospital with a knife wound to his leg. Sampdoria have also reached the quarterfinals after defeating Udinese on penalties following a 2-2 draw after extra time. The Genoa-based side scored all their five spot-kicks while Argentine striker German Denis missed his penalty as Udinese went out 5-4.","Italian champions Inter Milan record their fifth straight win under new coach Leonardo .

"(CNN) -- As Tunisia adjusts to a new government, Selma Beji is cautiously optimistic about the future -- and freedoms -- of her fellow Tunisians. A Tunisian native who is pursuing a master's degree in the United States, Beji said she was amazed that demonstrations -- driven largely by young adults and social media -- have led to such an uprising, which some people call the ""Jasmine Revolution."" ""We were like, this is going to die off,"" said Beji, whose family lives in the northern suburbs of Tunis. But ""Facebook was the drive of this revolution. Everybody was on Facebook ... If these protests started five years ago, they would have died."" President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's departure followed weeks of protests over what Tunisians said were poor living conditions, high unemployment, government corruption and repression. Al Kallel, a Tunisian native living in California, and a group of Tunisian friends held up signs at Facebook's headquarters in Palo Alto, California, on Saturday to ""thank Facebook for enabling our nation (both inside and outside the country) to freely share their opinion online, bridging our way to democracy."" Kallel said when he lived in Tunisia, residents didn't have access to Facebook. ""You can't pass info around without being censored,"" Kallel told CNN's iReport. The Tunisian unrest were sparked by the suicide of an unemployed college graduate in December. The man set himself on fire in front of a government building in the town of Sidi Bouzid after police confiscated his fruit cart, saying he was selling without a permit, according to Amnesty International. He died January 4 from his injuries. The event tore the lid off what appears to have been long-simmering fury at Ben Ali and his associates. Tunisians accuse the ruling circle of rampant corruption and nepotism. After a month of largely leaderless popular protests against the government, Ben Ali fled the country on Friday, and Fouad Mebazaa, the speaker of parliament, was sworn in the following day as interim president, and new elections are due within 60 days. The instability could be an omen of the future since Tunisia has been far from the only Arab nation with a long-time president and a young, underemployed population. Beji said some of her friends in Tunisia who have college degrees are unemployed. ""I'm very optimistic about (employment) after this,"" she said. ""I think more investors are going to start coming into the country. The country has a lot of potential."" Already, filters on websites such as YouTube -- put in place under Ben Ali -- were dropped, and internet speed picked up considerably -- a development that followed the new government's vow to ease restrictions on freedoms. Beji said she hopes the next president will support freedoms for Tunisians -- especially after what regular citizens showed what they are capable of. ""I think the next president is going to be scared. The revolution happened with no arms, no guns, no nothing -- just people on the streets,"" she said. ""I think the next president would be a little worried if he didn't give us freedom of any kind.""","""Facebook was the drive of this revolution,"" Selma Beji said .

"(CNN)  -- The Kurdish region of Iraq has seen gains in human rights, but security forces ""regularly abuse their authority"" and women continue to be targets of violence, Amnesty International said Tuesday. Iraqi Kurds mark International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women in November 2008. The international human rights group drew the conclusions in a report titled ""Hope and Fear, Human Rights in Kurdistan Region of Iraq."" The Kurdish region has been an island of relative stability during the Iraq war, and the report said it has ""witnessed growing prosperity"" and has made progress in human rights. But serious problems remain, Amnesty said. Asayish forces, as the local security forces are called, arrested and arbitrarily detained people, ""including some who were tortured or forcibly disappeared and whose fate and whereabouts remain unknown,"" the report said. The report said the torture included electric shocks, sleep deprivation, kicking, suspension by the wrists and ankles, and beatings with fists, cables and batons. Malcolm Smart, Amnesty's director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme, said the Kurdistan Regional Government ""must take concrete steps to rein in these forces and make them fully accountable under the law if recent human rights gains are to prove effective."" Amnesty said that Kurdish authorities have also failed to control the security wings of the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the two major Kurdish political movements that make up the regional government. The report, based on research from a fact-finding mission last year, said the Kurdistan Regional Government has made progress in human rights, citing, for example, the release of political prisoners detained without charges or trial. It also cites legislation expanding freedom of expression and measures that strengthen women's rights, and said several agencies are working to monitor and prevent violence against women. But Smart said problems such as ""arbitrary detention and torture, attacks on journalists and freedom of expression, and violence against women"" haven't ended and ""need urgently to be addressed by the government."" As for abuse against women, authorities must ""redouble their efforts to overcome discrimination and violence against women,"" he said, ""and end the vicious cycle of so-called honor killings and other attacks on women by men who wish to subordinate them."" According to official records, the report said, at least 102 women and girls were killed between the beginning of July 2007 and the end of June 2008 in the region. ""These include an unknown number of 'honor killings' -- women who were killed by male relatives because their behavior was considered to have infringed traditional codes of 'honor.' Victims of 'honor crimes' include women who have objected to being forcibly married as well as women who were found having telephone contact with a man without approval of their family,"" the report said. The report said 262 women and children ""died or were severely injured in the same period due to intentional burning, including suicides. Some women were reported to have been burned to disguise a killing."" The report cites one woman who was strangled to death apparently by her brother ""because of her suspected relationship with another man."" A 17-year-old female ""was shot dead after she sought a divorce from her husband."" A 13-year-old girl burned herself to death ""to escape forcible marriage to an adult man."" ""Such cases show how much more still needs to be done by the KRG authorities to give women and girls effective protection against violence from those who wish to control their behavior or force them into marriages against their will,"" Smart said. ""No effort should be spared to prosecute and imprison those who commit violence against women, and to make clear that those who perpetrate these crimes cannot escape justice."" The report also said that emerging independent press outlets that have criticized the KRG or have focused on the security forces, human rights violations and government corruption have been harassed. Journalists ""have been detained, beaten and harassed"" by security forces, and several newspapers have been sued by the KRG.","Kurdish security forces arbitrarily detain, torture people, Amnesty International says .

"(CNN) -- Elvis Presley. Marilyn Monroe. Jim Morrison. Officials won't say  where Michael Jackson was buried, but family gathered at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. Their graves are public shrines for fans and followers. Countless people from all over the world make pilgrimages to their burial sites, hoping to draw close to those they adored from afar. Now Michael Jackson's gravesite will become the next holy grail. A private gathering for the pop icon was held Tuesday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California. Afterward, his casket was taken to the public memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. But it remains unclear whether his body has been interred -- or where. Officials at Forest Lawn won't disclose where Jackson's body is being buried. If his final resting place is at Forest Lawn, fans who wish to visit will have to overcome the funeral company's stringent security patrols. A Los Angeles Police Department official told CNN that the force hoped Jackson would be buried outside of its jurisdiction for fear officers might be assigned to protect the grave for months. There has been some speculation that Jackson's body will eventually be moved to Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, California. But that would require the family to obtain zoning exemptions and settle legal disputes, which could take years. Jackson retained only a small share of ownership in the ranch. If a public memorial were created at Neverland -- or anywhere -- it might easily surpass the tombs of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley as the most-visited gravesite. ""If it gets moved somewhere more public, I think a lot of people will come visit,"" said Steve Goldstein, author of L.A.'s Gravesite Companion: Where the VIP's RIP. ""He'll probably take over as the most visited grave site over Marilyn."" Fame follows celebrities in life and in death. ""There's always a fascination with celebrities, but it's rude to stalk people and sit outside their houses,"" says Jim Tipton, founder of findagrave.com, a site that lists the grave records of more than 34 million celebrities and ordinary citizens. ""But once they are interred into the ground, anyone who wants to go can go."" Tipton's fascination with locating earthly remains began 15 years ago, when he saw mobster Al Capone's grave in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois. He and many others who are avid about visiting celebrity and historical graves dub themselves ""grave hunters."" They seek the dead for various reasons. Some go out of simple curiosity. Others are history lovers. Many are fans who deeply admired the stars. Some say they feel a connection to the celebrities by standing beside their graves. At Elvis Presley's Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee, guests visiting the grave can stay at the retro Heartbreak Hotel and visit the museum to learn more about the King of Rock and Roll. Westwood Memorial Park and Cemetery in Los Angeles houses Hollywood notables including sex symbol Marilyn Monroe and comic Rodney Dangerfield.  The most recent celebrity to be buried there is actress Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer last month. Visitors can access the cemetery easily, and even tour buses drop by. ""I'm a product of that era, of Charlie's Angels,"" said Jayne Osborne, a self-proclaimed grave hunter who visited Fawcett's grave a week ago. The 48-year-old education administrator began searching for celebrity graves in the early 1970s. Since then, she's visited hundreds of celebrity resting places in Southern California. ""I wanted to pay my respect."" At Westwood, the most popular grave site remains Monroe's. Fans often decorate her grave with flowers and cards. Her headstone is slightly darker than the others from so many fans touching it, grave hunters say. In Père-Lachaise, the largest cemetery in Paris, France, American singer Jim Morrison's grave is tattooed with graffiti and artwork. Morrison fans like to leave candles, poems and gifts as tokens of appreciation. At one point, fans were so rowdy that a stone block was put in place in an attempt to seal the grave from fans trying to unearth it. After unsuccessful attempts by French authorities to move the tomb to another site, security officers were placed at the grave. Similar trouble plagued Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia, where members of the Allman Brothers Band were buried in the early 1970s. Thousands of fans journeyed to visit the graves and party there, leaving behind cigarette butts and empty alcohol bottles. Relatives fought to have an iron fence erected around the graves. Some celebrity graves prove tempting to visitors, like that of heartthrob actor James Dean. His headstone in a public cemetery in Fairmount, Indiana, has been stolen twice. Forest Lawn Memorial Park remains one of the most exclusive Hollywood burial sites. The staff is tight lipped, refusing to release the whereabouts of anyone buried there, except to family members. Security cars constantly patrol the grounds. ""We don't advocate or promote any visitation out of respect for the privacy of the family,"" said William Martin, a spokesman for company. Company officials wouldn't say whether Jackson's body was, or could be, tucked into one of the cemetery's locked gardens where celebrities like Humphrey Bogart, Jean Harlow and Sammy Davis Jr. are laid to rest. If Jackson is buried in Forest Lawn, that won't stop fans and grave hunters from trying to sneak in, says Karen Fogarty, a paralegal from the San Fernando Valley area in California and an occasional celebrity grave hunter. ""It's going to keep Forest Lawn on their toes,"" she said.","Celebrities' graves become public shrines for fans and followers .

"(CNN) -- A former Marine and suspected serial rapist pleaded not guilty this week to raping and murdering 19-year-old college student Brianna Denison. The family of Brianna Denison launched a Web site dedicated to her memory after her death in 2008. James Biela, 27, is charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and sexual assault in the disappearance of Denison, who was last seen alive on her friend's sofa in Reno, Nevada, January 20, 2008. The construction worker entered his plea in Washoe County District Court on Wednesday. Judge Robert Perry set a tentative trial date for February 22, 2010, according to online court records. Denison, a sophomore at Santa Barbara City College in California, was visiting friends in her hometown of Reno when she disappeared. Three weeks later, her body was found in a field near her friend's home, partially covered with snow. An autopsy determined she had been sexually assaulted and strangled. A pair of panties that were not hers also were found near the body, in what police said was a ""calling card"" that helped them connect Biela not only to Denison, but also to another sexual assault. In a press conference after Biela's arrest in December, police said they were able to connect the former Marine's DNA with a sample on the panties. Police also found DNA matching Biela's on the rear door of the off-campus house where Denison was staying with friends. The sample also matched DNA found at the scene of a December 16 sexual assault, police said. The victim, a student at the University of Nevada , was able to escape her attacker and describe him in detail, police say. Both crimes bear a striking resemblance to several other sexual assaults in the area, leading police to believe that Biela is a serial rapist. They are asking other possible victims to come forward. The case went unsolved for almost 10 months until an anonymous tip from a friend of Biela's former girlfriend broke this cold case wide open, police said. Investigators had established that the killer was from the Reno area and had an unusual fetish of collecting one victim's underwear and leaving it at the next victim's crime scene. The tipster caught investigators' attention by telling them that Biela's former girlfriend had found two pairs of thong panties in his truck. Detectives immediately followed up on the tip and, with permission from the former girlfriend, took DNA samples from Biela's 4-year-old son. Lab tests showed that the boy's father -- Biela -- was almost certainly a match for the DNA found on the doorknob and at the crime scene, police said. The finding was confirmed when Biela was arrested and ordered to submit DNA samples. An overnight session at the crime lab confirmed the match, and charges were filed, police said. Investigators said they since have learned that Biela was familiar with the grounds of the university, having worked there on a construction job last year. Police say his work on campus put him in a position to easily target women. When first questioned about the Denison case in early November, Biela refused to submit DNA samples and provided an alibi to police, saying he'd been with his girlfriend. The girlfriend denies that he was with her the night Denison disappeared, investigators said. Calls to Biela's public defenders Friday were not answered. Meanwhile, investigators are certain there are other victims who haven't come forward. Police are urging anyone with more information to call the Reno Police Hot Line at 775-322-4900. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg and Rupa Mikkilineni contributed to this report.","James Michael Biela, 27, is charged with murder of Brianna Denison, 19 .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A former New York City bouncer was sentenced to life without parole Wednesday for the brutal slaying of a graduate student from Boston, the Brooklyn district attorney's office said. Darryl Littlejohn, 44, is already serving prison time for the attempted kidnapping of another student in 2005. Darryl Littlejohn, 44, was convicted of first-degree murder last month in the 2006 death of Imette St. Guillen, 24, who had been studying criminology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Littlejohn, who is already serving 25 years to life for the October 2005 attempted kidnapping of a 19-year-old Queens college student, will serve out the sentences consecutively, said Sarah McNaughton of the Brooklyn district attorney's office. During the trial, witnesses said they saw Littlejohn and St. Guillen leaving The Falls bar in lower Manhattan together early February 25, 2006. Littlejohn was working as a bouncer at the bar. Hours later, St. Guillen's nude body was found in an isolated lot in Brooklyn. Her face was covered with strips of packing tape, and a sock was stuffed into her throat. She died of asphyxiation, and investigators determined she had been raped. Littlejohn was charged with murder after investigators linked his DNA to blood found on plastic ties used to bind St. Guillen's hands behind her back. Littlejohn's attorney, Joyce David, has filed an appeal on behalf of her client and maintains his innocence. She said that although Littlejohn has a long criminal record, he has no history of violence against women. The horrific incident spread shockwaves through New York City nightlife, which relies heavily on unlicensed bouncers to keep order in the city's bars and nightclubs. Littlejohn is being held at New York's Rikers Island maximum security facility.

Continental Connection Flight 3407, operated by regional carrier Colgan Air, plunged into a house in Clarence Center, New York, on the night of February 12, killing all 49 on board as well as one man in the house. In a story Monday, The Wall Street Journal cited investigators as saying the crash resulted from pilot Marvin Renslow's incorrect response to the plane's precarious drop in speed: He overrode an emergency system known as a ""stick pusher,"" which sends the plane into a dive so it can regain speed and avoid a stall. The Journal's report said Colgan had not provided Renslow with hands-on flight-simulator training for a stick-pusher emergency. Colgan, in rebuttal, issued a statement saying Renslow had received classroom instruction for such an emergency.  Watch a Colgan official respond to questions » . The company also emphasized that the Federal Aviation Administration does not require pilots to receive a stick-pusher demonstration in a flight simulator. ""The FAA generally trains to standards of routine line operations. They don't focus on the edges of the envelope,"" stall recovery expert Doug Moss told CNN. Colgan further admitted that during his career, Renslow failed five ""check rides"" -- occasional tests of pilot proficiency -- including two that Colgan said he did not disclose on his application with the airline. His most recent failed check ride occurred 16 months before the crash. ""In the cases while with Colgan, he received additional training and successfully passed the check rides,"" the airline said. Colgan stressed that despite his performance on check rides, Renslow nonetheless ultimately passed his pilot exams and had ""all the training and experience to safely operate the Q400,"" the airplane involved in the crash. Colgan further insisted that pilot fatigue was not a factor in the crash, noting that Renslow had ""nearly 22 consecutive hours of time off before he reported for duty on the day of the accident."" In its statement, Colgan did not specifically address potential illness-related fatigue in 24-year-old co-pilot Rebecca Shaw, who, according to The Wall Street Journal report, said before takeoff that she probably should have called in sick. The National Transportation Safety Board begins a three-day hearing on the crash on Tuesday. Renslow's history as well as pilot training broadly will be examined.","Continental Connection Flight 3407 crashed near Buffalo in February; 50 people died .

"Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Jorge Elias Benjumea proudly inspects his plantain field. The 46-year-old father of three says he's not only happy his crops are doing well, but also, for the first time in years, he can tell the world that what he's growing is legal. Benjumea, a resident of the Colombian province of Meta; used to grow coca, the plant from which cocaine is produced. ""Everything is different now, more peaceful. I go to bed at night with no worries,"" Benjumea says. He used to make $2,800 a month growing coca. Now he makes about $840 with plantains. On the flip side, he doesn't have to deal with guerrillas or drug traffickers anymore. The Colombian government has greatly increased its military presence in the area, improving security and giving farmers an alternative to growing coca. Bolivia hopes for buzz with coca campaign . Benjumea says his peace of mind and the safety of his family are priceless. ""Coca is a plant that can make you a lot of money, but also gives you a lot of headaches,"" he says. He's part of a new wave of Colombian farmers growing alternative crops in a region called La Macarena. This region was known for decades as a stronghold of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the guerrilla group commonly called FARC. La Macarena used to be not only a recruiting and training hub for guerrillas, but also a major coca production center and a key transit route for illegal armed groups. In a community called Albania, farmers grow and process sugar cane. Not far from there, in El Pinalito, also in the province of Meta, another group is venturing into fish farming. Last year they sold 1.5 metric tons of a fish known regionally as cachama. The United States has provided more than $7 billion in the past 10 years to help Colombia fight drug trafficking. Most of the money has been used to help Colombia strengthen its military with equipment, training and intelligence. But another portion, recently rising, has been used to provide assistance to farmers interested in developing alternative crops like cacao (from which chocolate is made), plantains, yucca and papaya. Colombian National Security Adviser Sergio Jaramillo said government partnerships with the farmers in Meta have been very successful, but he emphasized that none of this would have been possible without a military presence to improve security. ""You need to stabilize those drug-producing areas. That's what we're doing here, and there's no better investment for prosperity in a country like Colombia than supporting the integrated approach of security and social development,"" Jaramillo said. During a three-day visit to Colombia, U.S. Drug Czar Gil Kerlikowske visited several communities that are developing alternative crops and met with President Juan Manuel Santos, a key U.S. ally in Latin America. ""We have to continue to be supportive of Colombia in a whole host of ways, (and) none of this was possible without safety and security first,"" Kerlikowske said. According to U.S. government figures, cocaine production in the South American country fell from 700 metric tons in 2001 to 270 in 2009, a 61 percent decrease. Going into alternative crops hasn't been easy for local farmers. At the fish farm in El Pinalito, the locals say at the beginning they only saw ""failures."" But after getting specialized training and equipment from the government, production began to increase considerably. At the sugar cane processing plant in the Albania community, farmers say they received financial support to buy machinery, which ""made all the difference.""","Some Colombian farmers take huge drop in income for more safety, peace .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan will hold parliamentary elections Monday, with political parties competing for 272 seats in the National Assembly. Election posters jostle for space on a street in Rawalpindi ahead of Pakistan's elections on Monday. The elections were due to take place in December of last year but were postponed after the assassination of Pakistan People's Party chairman, Benazir Bhutto. In 2008, 49 political parties applied for poll symbols with the Election Commission. Outlined below are the main contenders: . PPP . The assassination of leader Benazir Bhutto looms large over the PPP, which had been banking on the charismatic leader to rally supporters to its cause and shake off the charges of corruption that have dogged the party since Bhutto fled prosecution after two terms as prime minister. The fortunes of the party, launched in 1967 by her father Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, remains in the hands of her family, with son Bilwal installed as chairman. Founded on promises of ""egalitarian democracy,"" the PPP flirted with socialist principles in its early days, gaining a mass popularity that continues to ensure it is among Pakistan's largest political parties. While the PPP has lost touch with its socialist roots, it remains popular among Pakistan's oppressed and underprivileged, particularly in the southern province of Sindh, from where the Bhutto family hails. PML-N . The PML-N is the largest faction of the Pakistan Muslim League and is led by Nawaz Sharif, who has re-emerged as a political player in Pakistan in the past few months after returning from Saudi Arabia where he was exiled after being ousted from power in a 1999 coup led by Pervez Musharraf. The centrist conservative party was in power twice in the 90s, with both terms ending amid damaging allegations of corruption, despite campaigning on an anti-graft platform. Sharif's 1997 victory was the largest mandate every recorded in Pakistan, but was immediately called into question by his opponent Bhutto. The term ended in chaos as . PML-N under Sharif received a huge public mandate in 1997 and formed a government with two-thirds majority. Though his rule was credited with economic growth it was cut short when complaints of corruption and an attempt to replace the head of the military backfired when newly-installed army chief Musharraf led a successful coup, forcing him into exile to avoid corruption convictions. Permitted by Musharraf to return to Pakistan last year, Sharif is now banking  the PML-N's fortunes on a platform of renewing the country's top judiciary -- removed by Musharraf during a state of emergency. PML-Q . Formed under guidance from Musharraf in 2001, the PML-Q was originally a splinter faction of the Pakistan Muslim League, which was able to attract enough dissidents from the PML-N to cobble together an alliance and form a government in 2002. The largely center-conservative party has seen its power base dented through its association with Musharraf as polls show the president's falling popularity in the face of the resurgent PPP and PML-N. MMA . Formed after Musharraf allied himself to the U.S.-led anti-terror coalition in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attack on New York and Washington, the MMA is a coalition of six Islamic parties that emerged as a powerful challenger to the president. Opponents have decried the MMA, or Muttahida Majlis Amal's goal of establishing a theocracy in Pakistan, and its attempts to impose hardline sharia law in the impoverished areas where it exerts greatest control. The resolutely anti-American alliance, dominated by JI (Jamaat I Islami) and JUI-F (Jamiat Ulema Islam) saw success in the 2002 elections in the North West Frontier and Balochistan provinces and went on to form a provincial government in the NWFP and a coalition government in Balochistan. Its prospects are likely to be hampered by a dispute within the alliance over whether to boycott the parliamentary elections. MQM . The MQM stands for the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, a party formed to protect the rights of the Urdu-speaking immigrants from India after Partition. Led by Altaf Hussain from his self-imposed exile in the UK, the party has been supportive of Musharraf's policies and formed part of the PML-Q alliance. Frequently facing allegations of involvement in terrorist activities, the party's recent efforts to extend its support base to other provinces have yielded little success. ANP . The Awami National Party is a nationalist leftist party based in the North West Frontier province that and enjoys widespread popularity with ethnic Pakhtuns. The ANP did not enjoy much success in 2002 but has renewed hopes as the MMA's following fades in the Frontier. PTI . Pakistan Tehrik I Insaf is headed by the cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan. Vitriolic in his criticism of Musharraf's policies, Khan has failed to capitalize on his popularity as a sportsman, seeing his party take just one seat in the 2002 elections. PTI has said it will boycott the 2008 elections.  E-mail to a friend .","Pakistan will hold parliamentary elections Monday .

"CNN -- Getting enough rest should be as simple as just shutting your eyes. The alpha pod, designed for napping, includes . a heated, vibrating bed and a CD player. But according to a recent study done by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, a branch of the National Institutes of Health, it's really not that easy. Their research has found that 40 million Americans suffer yearly from chronic sleep disorders, and an additional 20 million complain of occasional sleeping problems. For some of us, it just means dark circles under our eyes and a desperate need for triple-caffeinated products. But the reality is that over the long haul, trouble with sleep can cause bigger problems. ""There are studies out there which would suggest that people who sleep less over long periods of time are at much higher risks of car accidents, and also some medical disorders like high blood pressure, potentially heart or stroke disease,"" said Dr. David Schulman, director of the Emory Sleep Clinic Laboratory in Atlanta, Georgia. And that means fewer than the seven to eight hours most people need daily to get the proper amount of rest. So what is the solution to all this restlessness? For some people, the answer might be to just buy some. Yes, sleep has now joined the ranks of those products we at one time thought we would never have to pay for, like water.   Years ago, the thought of paying money for a bottle of something you could get for free from the tap would have had people laughing. Now we can add sleep, or, more accurately, napping. Spas across the country have now added this new nap therapy to their offerings, so along with facials, waxing and massages, you can now grab some Z's for about a dollar a minute. Susan Vanyo, founder of the Rejuvenate Spa in Atlanta, describes what her spa offers to those who need extra shut-eye: . ""We have two types of nap pods,"" she says. ""They are called the energy pod and the alpha pod. The alpha pod has more of a spa-experience feel to it."" The pods release aromas and have a heated, vibrating bed, a CD player and headphones. ""Everything outside just goes away,"" she says.   The energy pod reclines, and has headphones with music piped in. ""You get a different sensation,"" Vanyo says.  Watch people try out the pods » . This napping therapy, while not taking the country by storm, has found some happy clients willing to pay for sleep. For Autumn Watson, whose full-time job becomes more challenging after a night where her young son doesn't sleep, a nap is worth every penny.   ""To have a designated place to be able to come and take a nap and relax away from the office, and not being afraid somebody's going walk in on you, is nice,"" she says. ""And you get on the ball quicker, after the nap, instead of feeling like you're exhausted."" And for Tremaine Perry, who works close to the spa, it took a bit of time to embrace this latest trend.   ""Initially, I was skeptical. You're paying for something that you can do at home for free, but it wasn't until I actually tried it and realized the difference"" between going through a full day needing rest and coming in, taking a quick break and going back to work. So it seems there is some truth to the phrase ""power nap."" Schulman, the sleep expert, says, ""For people who are chronically sleep-deprived, there is evidence that as little as 15 to 30 minutes of napping during the day can improve performance for two to four hours after the nap."" But while a nap might refresh, Schulman cautions, it's not going to make up for a long-term sleep deficit. So if you're getting by on five or six hours a night, ""it's ridiculous to assume that a 15- to 20-minute nap during the day, even if it's every day, is going to compensate for a two-hour deficit each night."" And finally there are other ways to recharge that don't cost money, including meditation, a walk outside, a hit of caffeine or even just getting up and walking away from your desk. But Schulman says that while all of these are good options, none of them work quite as well as a 20-minute nap. So maybe that dollar-a-minute price for some rest is actually money well spent.","Research: 40 million Americans suffer yearly from chronic sleep disorders .

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN)  -- Dayana and Moise smile as they shovel chips, with a mix of sand, into their mouths on a beach in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. They dig in the sand and run from the waves. The Haehre family looks like any other family on vacation, but this unplanned trip to Florida was where their brood grew from two children to four. Mindy and Oyvind Haehre started the process to adopt siblings Dayana, now 7 years old, and Moise, 5, from a Haitian orphanage in 2008. The adoption was to be completed next month when the family expected to move the children from a Port-au-Prince, Haiti, orphanage to their home in Loveland, Colorado. But that orphanage partially collapsed in last week's devastating earthquake. All 25 children there survived, but they had to move out onto the street. Search lists of the missing and the found . Mindy Haehre said her family was lucky; the good news about her children traveled quickly. ""We knew they were safe,"" she said, ""but still when your kids are in danger nothing can be good enough unless you are with them."" The Haehres heard that Dayana and Moise might be among a small group of Haitian children whose adoptions were set that the U.S. military would fly to Florida. So they packed up their other two children, Silje and Jakob, and caught a flight to Fort Lauderdale. On Sunday as they checked into their hotel, the phone rang. It was the call they were hoping for. Their children were indeed among the small group of children from the orphanage being evacuated to the United States. The flight was heading for an airport in central Florida. The Haehres jumped in their rental car and drove about four hours north. ""We said their names and they looked over and their eyes got big and they got big smiles and they came over and hugged us and kissed us and just kept smiling,"" Mindy Haehre said. Big brother Jakob admitted he didn't enjoy the drive but said: ""I was pretty excited. It was really fun to know that I can bring them home."" Dayana and Moise were already familiar with their new family. They had met in Haiti several times while the adoption process was slowly moving along. If there were any signs of trauma after the children's ordeal, the Haehres said they did not see them. Watch how the children had been living outside . ""Within probably 10 minutes all four kids were running around the customs area of the airport, playing and being noisy and acting like kids,"" Mindy Haehre said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Some 290 kilograms (639 pounds) of ""high-grade cocaine"" was discovered in a shipping container at a Hong Kong terminal, the government said in a statement Wednesday. The cocaine, worth some HK $260 million (U.S. $33 million) was found December 29 at the Kwai Chung Container Terminal, ""in a container arriving from South America and destined for the mainland,"" Hong Kong's Information Services Department said. Hong Kong's customs department has recently stepped up inspections of ""suspicious consignments from South America"" at the terminal, the statement said. Customs officers intercepted two containers that purportedly contained ""wood working products"" from a container vessel from Chile, officials said. ""Following inspection using the X-ray system and drug detector dogs, officers found a batch of cocaine in one of the containers, concealed inside 88 pieces of hollowed-out wood planks,"" the statement said. The investigation was ongoing, authorities said, and no arrests have yet been made. Hong Kong is working closely with Chinese and overseas drug enforcement agencies, said John Lee, head of Hong Kong Customs' Drug Investigation Bureau, in the statement. It was the largest seizure of drugs ever for the customs department. However, Hong Kong police last April had a larger bust, which saw the seizure of 372 kilograms (820 pounds) of cocaine with a value of HK $337 million, or U.S. $43.4 million. That seizure stemmed from a missing persons report that led to the discovery of the cocaine in a home. Eight people were arrested in that case, police said at the time. Drug trafficking is a serious offense, the Hong Kong government statement said, with a maximum penalty of life in prison and a $5 million fine.

"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old American Muslim detained and questioned in Kuwait is suing the U.S. government, claiming it is refusing to let him fly home because he is on a ""no-fly"" list. Stuck in limbo between the country he calls home and the place he was visiting on what his lawyer describes as a journey of self-discovery, Gulet Mohamed of Alexandria, Virginia, has been trapped in Kuwait for nearly a month, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court in Virginia. ""No-fly"" lists were set up to protect Americans against potential threats. They are designed to prevent terrorist suspects from boarding planes to and from the United States. But Mohamed's lawyer, Gadeir Abbas, says in the lawsuit that the U.S. government is impeding his client's basic right to return and live freely in the United States.  Abbas is a staff attorney for the Counsel on American-Islamic Relations. At a hearing Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, Judge Anthony J. Trenga  told the government that it should make arrangements to allow Mohamed to return before the end of this week unless it could produce evidence against him. The lawsuit says Mohamed came to the United States from Somalia with his family when he was just 3 years old, grew up in Virginia and is now a naturalized citizen. In March of 2009, Mohamed's curiosity led him halfway around the world to visit relatives living overseas and to learn Arabic, according to the lawsuit. He started his journey in Sanaa, Yemen, but then moved to Somalia where he stayed with relatives for several months. By August he was on his way to Kuwait where an uncle took him in so he could continue his Arabic studies, the suit says. Mohamed followed proper travel procedures, according to the lawsuit, renewing his visitor's visa twice during his stay in Kuwait. But when he went to Kuwait's international airport last December to get another 90-day extension he waited several hours. The lawsuit says Mohamed wrote an e-mail to his brother in Virginia while he waited, saying the process was taking longer than usual. That was the last time anyone heard from him for a week, the suit says. According to the lawsuit, Mohamed says he was approached at the airport by two men who handcuffed and blindfolded him. They drove him to another location in an SUV. Mohamed claims he was beaten, tortured and interrogated over the next week. The lawsuit describes him being whipped, threatened with electrocution and questioned by captors who had private information about his family in the United States . They also questioned him about his relationship with Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born Muslim cleric who has close ties to al Qaeda and who is believed to be in Yemen. Mohamed's lawyer says he denies any link to  al-Awlaki. Mohamed was transferred to a deportation facility in Kuwait on December 28, the lawsuit says. He used a fellow detainee's hidden cell phone and was able to contact his family and retain a CAIR attorney. According to the lawsuit, Kuwaiti officials have told Mohamed's family they are holding him on behalf of the U.S. His lawyers say Kuwaiti officials have tried to deport Mohamed but were unable to do so because the United States had placed him on a ""no-fly"" list. A U.S. official confirmed to CNN that Mohamed is on a ""no-fly"" list, but would not explain why. Mohamed was visited twice by FBI agents while in detention, according to the suit. He claims the FBI agents physically intimidated him, threatened him with criminal charges and told him he would remain in detention indefinitely if he didn't speak to them. Mohamed refused to answer their questions without counsel, the lawsuit says. Mohamed's lawyers told CNN that at the suggestion of  Kuwaiti officials, his family recently bought a plane ticket for him to return to the United States. However, when the officials took him to the airport Sunday, he was not allowed onto the plane. Mohamad's lawyers contend that the information that his interrogators had -- and the questions he was asked -- indicate it was the U.S. government who had him held and questioned. U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley denied Mohamed was being detained at the behest of the United States. Crowley told CNN Tuesday that the State Department has provided Mohamed with consular access and is committed to him having fair treatment. Crowley said the department hasn't had access to Mohamed since December. CNN's Laurie Ure contributed to this report.","Gulet Mohamed, a naturalized U.S. citizen, is on a ""no-fly"" list and cannot fly home .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Growing up, my Sherman tank-like aunt constantly blamed her thyroid for inability to lose weight. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland at the base of the neck. Most of her seven sisters, behind her back, blamed something else, like her eating an entire cake by herself at their weekly coffee klatch. But who knows? That was 15 years ago and our awareness of thyroid and its many problems has grown. She just might have been right pointing her finger at her thyroid, because, according to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, as many as 27 million Americans suffer from some type of thyroid gland misfiring. And half of these folks don't even know what they are missing. But their bodies do. For while this little, butterfly-shaped gland at the base of our neck, weighing in at barely an ounce, seems both delicate and innocuous, when not in hormonally balanced harmony, it packs a wallop. The truth is, it's more like the Muhammad Ali of our body's hormone factories; it floats and appears like a butterfly but stings like a bee. ""Our thyroid, even though it's a small gland in your neck, controls everything,"" says endocrinologist Karen Smith. ""It can control your thought patterns, your mood, your heart rate, blood pressure, digestive system, menstrual system, skin and bones."" That's a lot of controlling going on, but more than controlling, this little gland's job is all about regulating. The thyroid gland is in charge of making two very important hormones, respectively known as T3 and T4. And it's when the levels go awry that we start to have problems. For most people suffering from thyroid dysfunction, and these problems affect more women than men, their problem is that not enough hormones are being made. This is called hypothyroidism, and the symptoms are somewhat elusive. That is probably why doctors such as Smith use a handy tool to help patients identify the problem. ""There is actually an acronym that we use for hypothyroidism,"" she said. ""It's called sluggish. Sometimes when you feel sluggish, this might serve as a red flag and you might think, 'Oh it might be my thyroid!'"" Sluggish stands for . Sleepiness, fatigue, tiredness . Loss of memory . Unusually dry coarse skin . Goiter (enlarged thyroid) Gradual personality change . Increase in weight, bloating, puffiness . Sensitivity to cold . Hair loss, sparseness of hair . And while these symptoms might be signals that something other than your thyroid is the issue, it's worth getting it tested. A simple blood test will tell you if your problems are a bigger hormonal deal. The condition is lifelong, or as Smith puts it, ""from the cradle to the rocking chair."" Meaning that it can appear at just about any age, but once identified it doesn't go away. Its treatment, however, is fairly straightforward: hormone replacement therapy. But on the other side of the thyroid production line is the overzealous hormone maker. A lot less common than hypothyroidism, this is known as hyperthyroidism. ""Hyperthyroidism is when the thyroid is actually making too much thyroid hormone. I tell my patients, it's like a forest fire in California, burning everything up, ""explains Smith, who just recently found out she suffered from this issue. It took almost a year for her to figure it out since she had no family history to worry about, and most thyroid problems are usually genetic, even though she displayed all the classic symptoms. ""My first symptoms were irritability, feeling tired and blue. My memory was poor and I had a hard time concentrating. Weight loss, despite being constantly hungry and eating like a pig. Long durations of sleep but never feeling rested,"" Smith says. Finally when her hands started trembling and her heart started racing, she sought medical help. A blood test revealed her levels were off the charts. Good news for the young doctor who feared she had cancer or mercury poisoning. But just like hypothyroidism, this conditions is very treatable. Smith, who is doing much better now, details the options. ""The treatment is very different from hypothyroidism; we are actually trying to slow the function of the thyroid down. ""There are actually three ways to treat it,"" Smith said. ""Surgery was a way we used to treat it in the past. We don't use that as much any more unless someone has a nodule and you think that may be a suspicious cell or cancer."" Today's most common treatment is anti-thyroid medications, which  slow hormone production. Radioactive iodine also is used, she said. ""It's a substance that when you give it, it will actually damage the thyroid to help put out the fire, so to speak, to put out the flame of the overactive gland."" Doctors now recommend that everyone over 35 get his or her thyroid gland tested regularly. Because there are certain risks with even mild changes in thyroid levels, those considered at high risk, including pregnant women and those with a family history of thyroid problems, need to get tested earlier and more frequently, Smith said. Which leads me back to that aunt of mine. If she was right and it was not just an overactive hand-to-mouth cake thing, then I better call my doctor pronto to schedule my own test.","As many as 27 million Americans suffer from some type of thyroid gland misfiring .

"Washington (CNN) -- The interpretation of complex legal verbiage is the Supreme Court's bailiwick, but sometimes the outcome of a case falls upon the meaning of single word. The magic word in an appeal argued Wednesday was ""personal,"" and whether it extends beyond humans to ""artificial"" entities like corporations. Telecom giant AT&T wants ""personal privacy"" protections applied to businesses, just as they have long been granted to individuals. At issue is whether corporate ""personhood"" extends to the Freedom of Information Act, which exempts the public release of government documents that invade personal privacy. The company wants material gathered by a federal agency during a consumer investigation to be kept secret. Several justices seemed deeply skeptical of the company's claims for relief. Citing ""dozens and dozens"" of examples in a study of government bureaucracy, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that ""overwhelmingly, 'personal' is used to describe an individual, not an artificial being."" ""Can you give me any examples in common usage where people would refer to the 'personal privacy' of a corporation?"" asked Justice Antonin Scalia. ""It's a very strange phrase to me."" But others on the bench were not willing to say personal privacy applies only to a single human being. The dispute began in 2004 when AT&T Inc. found out it may have overcharged the federal government for the E-Rate program, which provides affordable internet and telecom access for schools and libraries across the United States. The company voluntarily turned over documents to the Federal Communications Commission, the agency charged with investigating the matter. Months later, a trade group that included some of AT&T's competitors filed a Freedom of Information request for all correspondence related to the E-Rate probe. The material included AT&T memos, e-mails, invoices and employee names. The company said the material was exempt from public release, since it was collected strictly for ""law enforcement purposes,"" according to court filings, and it argued that disclosure would cause an ""unwarranted invasion of personal privacy."" The FCC ultimately rejected the claims, saying the personal privacy exemption applies only to individuals. A federal appeals court reversed, finding for the corporation, and prompting the government's Supreme Court appeal. Wednesday's hourlong oral arguments featured several justices offering various examples of the extent to which ""personal"" privacy could ever be applied to the corporate theory. ""For example, you could refer to personal jurisdiction over a corporation, couldn't you?"" Justice Samuel Alito asked the Justice Department's lawyer, Anthony Yang. ""I suppose families have rights of personal privacy, don't they?"" added Chief Justice Roberts, extending the term beyond individuals. AT&T's attorney, Geoffrey Klineberg, told the court the issue is one of fairness. ""All we are asking for and indeed all that Congress provided for is that the privacy interests be weighed against the public interest in disclosure. And what the FCC did here was to categorically exclude corporations from the protections"" under federal law. Ginsburg was unconvinced. ""How does the commission, unaided by AT&T, go through the papers and decide what would be embarrassing for an AT&T employee, as distinguished from the corporation?"" Klineberg said e-mails could be exposed to public view showing corporate officers who ""may engage in a frank exchange about the competence and intelligence of a would-be regulator of the corporation. Or disparaging comments"" about a business competitor, something that should be protected under privacy laws. ""Why does that relate to the corporation's privacy interest?"" replied Scalia. ""Anything that would embarrass the corporation is a privacy interest?"" The AT&T lawyer ran into further trouble when he tried to mince words -- suggesting that because ""person"" is defined to include a corporation in the relevant federal statute, the term ""personal"" also must apply. ""I tried to sit down and come up with other examples where the adjective was very different from the root noun,"" said John Roberts. ""It turns out it is not hard at all. You have craft and crafty. Totally different. Crafty doesn't have much to do with craft. Squirrel, squirrely. Right? I mean, you have a pastor and pastoral. Same root, totally different. So I don't think there's much to the argument that because 'person' means one thing, 'personal' has to be the same relation."" Beyond interpreting the meaning of personal privacy, the court may also have to wrestle with defining or redefining ""corporate,"" either as an association of citizens with extended, shared rights, or as a state-chartered entity with its own separate, competing rights apart from those of its members. Such interpretation was key to the high court's controversial campaign finance ruling a year ago, in which the conservative majority gave corporations greater power to spend freely in federal elections, overturning a federal law that had imposed strict limits. The court said corporations had to be treated as ""persons"" when it came to campaign spending, with the same power as individual donors. Now the dispute is whether corporations enjoy similar protections in the privacy context. Liberal groups have complained that the Roberts court has been overly friendly to businesses in recent rulings, at the expense of individual consumers. They want a blanket rule exempting corporations from personal privacy protections. ""Congress did not and could not imbue corporations with the dignity interests that FOIA protects when it shields living, breathing human beings from invasions of personal privacy,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the Constitutional Accountability Center. ""A corporate charter cannot blush or feel embarrassed by FOIA's policy of transparency,"" A number of media organizations have also filed briefs in support of the Obama administration, saying the Freedom of Information Act has been a powerful tool to hold governments and corporations accountable. Coalitions of business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, are backing AT&T. Justice Elena Kagan is not participating in the case because she had handled the appeal as the administration's solicitor general before being nominated to the high court last year. The case is FCC v. AT&T Inc. (09-1279). A ruling is expected in the next five months or so.","The Supreme Court mulls whether a corporation has ""personal privacy""

"Washington (CNN) -- Tuesday's State of the Union address will be watched closely not only for what is said, but also for who will there in person to hear it -- especially the black-robed members of the U.S. Supreme Court. At least one member of the bench, Justice Samuel Alito, has publicly stated he will not attend after the dramatic criticism leveled at a court ruling by President Barack Obama. One or more justices have attended the annual speech to Congress and the nation in recent decades. Court members are not required by law to be there, but custom has dictated their appearance, mostly for show. They are a key, if low-key, part of the pageantry, and are compelled to sit politely and stoically amid the often high-spirited partisan rhetoric and response of the event. There is no word yet from the high court on who will attend. Invitations are sent to each chamber, and the justices have individual discretion as to whether to go. When they do, they wear their traditional judicial robes, are escorted into the House chamber as a group and take prominent seats up front, joined by other officers of the court such as the marshal and clerk. Justices Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy have been regular attendees. Government sources say Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who joined the bench in 2009, is expected to be there, and so is the court's newest member, Justice Elena Kagan, on the job since August. Obama nominated both women. Democrats last year cheered the president when he dressed down high court conservatives in last January's State of the Union address. Obama criticized the majority ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, issued a week earlier, which removed legal barriers preventing corporations and unions from spending unlimited sums on federal elections. ""With all due deference to the separation of powers,"" Obama said, ""the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests -- including foreign corporations -- to spend without limit in our elections."" Alito, sitting just feet away in the audience, shook his head and mouthed words interpreted as ""not true."" He had been a regular at previous addresses, but in October 2010 he told an audience in New York that he felt ""like the proverbial potted plant"" at such occasions and would not be attending in the near future. The 60-year-old justice also, with a smile, noted that his colleagues ""who are more disciplined refrain from manifesting any emotion or opinion whatsoever."" Most of the intrigue over who will attend his year's speech centers on Chief Justice John Roberts, who has labeled the political atmosphere at last year's address ""very troubling."" Roberts, who turns 56 next Thursday, said last March that partisan rhetoric and gestures aimed at the court left him questioning whether his colleagues should continue to attend. ""It does cause me to think whether or not it makes sense for us to be there"" he said. ""To the extent the State of the Union has degenerated into a political pep rally, I'm not sure why we're there."" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs responded quickly with an indirect attack on Roberts, saying ""the only thing troubling"" was the Citizens United ruling itself. During the 2010 address, members of Congress sat just behind the justices, many applauding loudly when Obama made his remarks about the court's election spending case. Sources close to Roberts have said he has grown increasingly ""frustrated"" at what he views as the growing partisanship aimed at the federal courts, particularly the Supreme Court . Both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden -- when they were senators -- voted against Roberts and Alito during court confirmation proceedings. Some justices have been regular no-shows at the State of the Union, including John Paul Stevens, who stepped down from the court last year. Roberts' predecessor, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, also rarely appeared in person. Another more vocal no-go is Justice Antonin Scalia, who has compared the televised State of the Union to ""cheerleading sessions."" ""I don't know at what point that happened, but it has happened, and now you go and sit there like bumps on a log while applause lines cause one half of the Congress to leap up while [another line] causes the other half to leap up,"" he said last November. ""It is a juvenile spectacle. And I resent being called upon to give it dignity."" Scalia, a generally verbose and animated jurist, said bluntly: ""You just sit there, looking stupid."" Breyer, on the other hand, has crossed the street to attend every State of the Union but one since joining the court in 1994. He missed President Bill Clinton's last annual address in 2000 because of the flu. Many believe the justices have go to such events, that it's just another unwanted chore of office. Not so, Breyer told CNN in 2005. ""People attend if they wish to attend. I do wish to attend, so I go.""","President Obama condemned a Supreme Court ruling during last year's speech .
In the wake of that speech, Justice Samuel Alito has said he won't attend this year .
Chief Justice John Roberts last year derided the ""pep rally"" atmosphere .
Justice Stephen Breyer, however, said he enjoys attending and will again ."
"CHILLICOTHE, Ohio (CNN) -- Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain are well aware of what's at stake in Ohio. Mike Milburn, left, and Dan DeGarmo are skeptical about what both candidates bring to the table. No Republican has ever won the White House without winning Ohio, a state that has received more visits from the candidates and their running mates this year than any other. Inside the bellwether state is the bellwether town of Chillicothe, a town that often mirrors the state's election results. Voters there are divided. With less than a month to go until the election, it's concerns about the financial markets and the economy that dominate the airwaves at the town's radio station. ""The only other people that've experienced something like what we're experiencing now are our grandparents or our great-grandparents,"" host Dan Ramey said on his radio show on WBEX-AM. At Carl's Townhouse, the outlook among the breakfast crowd was gloomy. ""I think that the money they just passed in Congress is just postponing what's going to happen in the future, which I think is going to be another Depression,"" said resident Mike Milburn. Milburn said he lives paycheck to paycheck to support his four kids. For Dan DeGarmo, it's the same -- his fourth child is due soon. ""I don't see how either of those candidates offer any solid solutions that give Americans comfort,"" he said.  Watch more on Ohio's bellwether town » . Both men are registered Republicans. Milburn said he might not vote at all, while DeGarmo said he plans to vote for McCain. Jeff Ragland, a cement worker, said he's voting for Obama. ""I feel like he's more for the people that are people like me,"" he said. People like Theresa Hall, an undecided Independent, are the targets of both candidates as they enter into the final weeks of campaigning. ""It seems like when you watch them, they're pretty much just at each other. He says this, he says that,"" Hall said. Along Chillicothe's Main Street, buildings in need of repair provide reminders that this once booming industrial town has seen better days. Obama's troops are trying to make inroads among the population of 22,000 that went for George Bush in the past two elections, and team McCain is working to keep the county red. Right now, people say the town is divided -- and so are the predictions. ""This community seems to just be enough Republican to help [McCain] out,"" WBEX's Ramey said, adding that his gut feeling is that will be the case this year. DeGarmo, however, disagreed. ""Honestly, I think Obama is going to win,"" he said. Weighing sentiments like those is one way to get a pulse on how this town might vote in November. But in one indication of the town's importance, McCain has already visited, and Obama is scheduled to stop by on Friday.","Chillicothe, population 22,000, is considered a bellwether town in Ohio .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In our constant battle of the bulge, a new weapon is gaining in popularity. Mineral body wraps are supposed to help you lose weight, but doctors are skeptical. The basic concept is simple: loss by bondage, or body wraps. Around for decades, body wraps were first made popular by Hollywood stars but have since become available to lesser-known mortals. These wraps come in a host of styles; from minerals to mud, from moving to motionless. Their aim: better bodies. Their claim: less of you when you're done. ""We do mineral body wraps that take off inches and we guarantee people will lose 6 to 20 inches on the first wrap or the next one is free,"" says Julie Tracey, co-owner of Atlanta's Suddenly Slimmer salon. But Dr. Erica Brownfield, associate professor of medicine at Emory, is skeptical, at best. ""These results are going to be temporary and there is no scientific data to support what they're claiming is actually going on,"" she said. In the land of wraps, measurements are key. You wear very little clothing for the body wrap -- a small top matched with a small bottom. These are preferably made from breathable fabric without buttons or zippers, which could get in the way and cause chafing or pinching. The next step is all about the numbers. The wrapper puts measuring tape around various parts of your body and draws marks in black -- sort of ""slash marks the spot."" Typically, between a dozen and 20 spots are measured. And it's the sum total of these spots that will tell you how many inches you've lost when the treatment is over. Most providers will guarantee some inches lost from your first wrap but say you need a series of visits if you want to reduce by as much as, say, a clothing size, Tracey says.  Health for Her: What's it like to get a wrap? » . And priced at $50 to $100, a treatment like this is not a  cheap quick fix. But how do they work? The treatment ""draws out metabolic waste and impurities from the body that lets water flow through better,"" Tracey says. ""Retained water dilutes the metabolic waste and those go between the fat cells and spread things apart."" ""With the compression of the bandages, because you are wrapped up real tight, we push those fat cells back together and that is what changes the shape."" Aside from inches gone, body wraps claim to help with issues such as cellulite, skin tone and body shaping. Tracey, whose company has done almost 8,000 wraps, says the treatments also help with stretch marks, wrinkles and lines. But Brownfield and others in the medical field aren't quite buying it. ""Their claims say they are squeezing the fat cells closer together,"" Brownfield says,"" but I think it's very important for people to realize that they're not losing fat cells."" ""Those fat cells, once you decompress them and take those wraps off, they're going to go back to their usual shape and size."" Brownfield is also concerned that, in some cases, these wraps could be a health hazard. ""Actually, depending on which wrap you use they can be harmful, they can dehydrate the body,"" she says, which can be dangerous for some people. She also cautions people to make sure they know what type of minerals and solutions are being used in the procedure. Allergic reactions are one concern, but also any type of open wound, contagious disease or rash might make a body wrap a bad idea. And finally, if you have any medical concerns, talk to a doctor before deciding if wrapping up is your best bet for shaping up.","Salons claim body wraps, which are gaining popularity, help you lose inches .

"(CNN) -- An Alaska judge warned Gov. Sarah Palin's family against trying to get her then-brother-in-law fired, according to court records. Investigators want to know if Sarah Palin tried to use her position improperly to get her former brother-in-law fired. That warning came long before the controversy over her dismissal of the brother-in-law's boss, the state's public safety commissioner, records show. Palin, the Republican nominee for vice president, is battling allegations she and her advisers pressured Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan to fire her sister's husband, State Trooper Mike Wooten. Palin's sister, Molly McCann, and Wooten were in the process of getting a divorce when the judge hearing the couple's case said McCann's family appeared to be putting Wooten's job at risk at a time when he would be required to pay child support. ""It appears for the world that Ms. McCann and her family have decided to take after the guy's livelihood, that whatever who did what to whom has overridden good judgment,"" Superior Court Judge John Suddock said during an October 2005 hearing. ""Aesop told us not to slay the goose that lays the golden egg. For whatever reason, people are trying to slay the goose here, and it tends to diminish his earning capacity."" At the time, Palin was a private citizen and would not become governor until 2006. In complaints filed with the state police, she and other relatives had accused Wooten of threatening her family during the divorce. Suddock was in the process of settling the couple's property and child-support arrangements in the 2005 hearing. The judge said his decision might have been different had Wooten's continued employment with the state police been more certain. ""The plaintiff's table has created a situation where that is a very fragile outcome,"" he said. Wooten's union representative testified that the trooper was the subject of a ""constant stream"" of complaints from his ex-wife's family. ""If things don't change, Mike's career is in jeopardy,"" the union rep said. ""My advice to Mike was to find another job,"" said John Cyr, now executive director of the Public Safety Employees Association. ""I think he needs, career-wise, to look for work elsewhere."" CNN obtained audio recordings of the hearing from the court clerk's office in Anchorage, Alaska. Roberta Erwin, the attorney who represented McCann, declined comment on the case Wednesday, and other representatives of the governor did not immediately return phone calls. Wooten was suspended for five days in March 2006, after state police commanders determined he had used a Taser on his 10-year-old stepson ""in a training capacity,"" drove his patrol car while drinking beer and illegally shot a moose using his wife's hunting permit. In a February 2008 hearing over new custody issues, Wooten briefly complained that ""disparagement"" by his ex-wife's family was continuing. Complaints about Wooten from Palin and her family have been under scrutiny since Gov. Palin's July firing of Monegan, whose duties included management of the state police force. After his dismissal, Monegan said he was fired because he refused to succumb to pressure from the governor's office to fire Wooten, and his allegations have led to an investigation by the state Legislature. Palin has denied any wrongdoing, saying the commissioner was removed because of disagreements over budget issues. Her attorneys have called Wooten a ""rogue trooper"" and said no one in the governor's family knew of his suspension until after Monegan's dismissal. Spokesmen for Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign have said the legislative probe has become a ""political circus"" since McCain tapped Palin as his running mate in August. Palin originally pledged to cooperate with the investigation and disclosed that members of her administration had contacted state police officials nearly two dozen times to discuss Wooten. But last week, she asked the state personnel board to conduct its own probe, and a string of witnesses has failed to show up at scheduled depositions with the investigator hired by the Legislature. Last week, Cyr's union filed its own complaint against Palin and top aides, accusing them of improperly attempting to use confidential information from Wooten's personnel files against him. The McCain campaign says Wooten agreed to release his files during the divorce proceedings, and the information was in the public domain.","NEW: Judge told Palin not to interfere with former brother-in-law's job .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The doors to the headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference civil rights group have been welded shut and padlocked, an escalation in a power struggle between two factions claiming leadership of the organization, the two sides said Tuesday. The doors were discovered shut Monday night. The Rev. Markel Hutchins, a recent aspirant to the organization's presidency who claims to be on the board, said the doors were welded and padlocked to keep the current leadership out of the headquarters building. ""They refused to leave the building, and under the law you can't remove them forcibly,"" Hutchins told CNN affiliate WSB. ""So what we had to do was make certain we secured the building while no one was inside to protect the safety and security and the integrity of the organization."" ""I am troubled by this conduct. It is the act of reckless individuals,"" SCLC Chairwoman Sylvia Tucker said in a statement released Tuesday. ""Hutchins has no right to be on SCLC property,"" Tucker said. ""His conduct of vandalizing and damaging SCLC property proves that Hutchins will do anything to try to control the SCLC."" Tucker and her faction say that Hutchins has never been on the board of the SCLC or been a national officer for the organization. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the co-founders of the SCLC, which was formed in 1957 to coordinate protest activities across the Southeast, the group's website says. The organization has seen a power struggle dating back about a decade, said Ralph Luker, a retired professor who specialized in the civil rights movement and has been an observer of the SCLC. But the current crisis stems from accusations that former officers diverted SCLC funds into non-SCLC accounts, he said. Those charges remain under investigation. A former chairman and former treasurer were removed from the board, and those who backed them formed the faction that is quarrelling with the current leadership. Hutchins aligned himself with the faction backing the ousted leaders, Luker said. Hutchins ran for SCLC president last year but was defeated by Bernice King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s daughter. He was then appointed to the board by the faction led by the ousted chairman, a move that a judge has since ruled invalid. ""That essentially is what this is about: who effectively is going to control the organization,"" Luker said.","Action comes amid power struggle between factions claiming leadership of SCLC .

"Editor's note: Rep. Dave Camp is a Republican from the 4th district of Michigan and is his party's ranking member on the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Dave Camp said Americans pay too much for health care due to waste, lawsuits and fraud. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Americans want, deserve and demand health care reform. Wednesday, I and my Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives are unveiling common sense health care reforms that focus on increasing the affordability, accessibility and availability of quality health care. Our plan will lower costs, make health care more convenient for patients and improve quality at a price our country can afford. Our chief concern is making health care affordable for all Americans. To do so, we believe in reforming before spending. The system now is so complex and unwieldy that billions of dollars are wasted every year. In fact, Americans pay more for their health care per person than anyone else in the world; twice what the Canadians do and two-and-a-half times what the British spend. It makes no sense. To lower health care costs, we must 1) weed out the rampant overspending in our current system that is driven by the twin forces of trial lawyers and fraudsters, 2) modernize medical regulations that haven't been changed in decades, and 3) make sure the government is helping every American get insurance, not just those who have health insurance through their job. Attacking the unnecessary costs in our current system starts with implementing comprehensive medical liability reform, so when doctors are in exam rooms they are thinking about their patients, not about ordering more tests in case somebody tries to sue later. This will reduce the practice of defensive medicine and save billions of dollars in wasted health care spending. We also must demand greater oversight and fraud prevention in Medicare and Medicaid -- the nation's health care programs for the seniors, the poor and the disabled. Abuse is so rampant in these programs that the chief counsel to the Health and Human Services Inspector General said, ""building a Medicare fraud scam is far safer than dealing in crack or dealing in stolen cars, and it's far more lucrative."" Malpractice reform and fraud prevention are a good start, but just a start. We will build on those successes by accelerating the move toward an electronic record system, minimizing the numerous administrative requirements at doctor offices, hospitals and insurance companies. By doing so, we can tackle the mountain of repetitive and unnecessary paperwork that clogs our system, drives up costs and creates headaches for patients and doctors alike. It is also time to allow states, small businesses and other organizations to increase their purchasing power by banding together to offer health insurance at lower cost. A small business in Ohio might not be able to afford health insurance on its own, but when joining with dozens of other small employers in Michigan and Indiana, the pool gets bigger and the price gets lower. Even with these reforms, the cost of health care is still too high for many Americans. The federal government has a patchwork of subsidies for those buying health insurance that is full of inequities. While we are waiting for the cost of our plan to be determined by the Congressional Budget Office, we already know it would be cheaper than other alternatives being discussed. To help address the inequities, our plan gives Americans who purchase insurance on their own a tax deduction, treating them more like those who get insurance through a job or who are self-employed. And we create incentives for all Americans to save now for future and long-term health care needs by improving health savings accounts and flexible spending arrangements and creating new tax benefits to offset the costs of long-term care premiums. Republicans also provide financial assistance through new refundable and advanceable tax credits to those who need it most: low- and modest-income Americans. And, especially in today's economy where so many workers have been forced to retire early or have been laid off, we recognize that many Americans who have not yet hit retirement age often have an especially hard time finding affordable health insurance. Thus, we offer additional financial help to those ages 55 to 64. We also recognize that many Americans with pre-existing conditions find insurance is either unaffordable or unavailable. Our plan addresses this by fostering innovative state reinsurance programs and improved high-risk pools, ensuring that high-risk individuals get affordable coverage. These and other measures will ensure every American, regardless of income, regardless of where they choose to live, regardless of pre-existing conditions or past illness, will have access to affordable, quality health care. Republicans stand ready to work with the president and our Democratic colleagues in Congress to improve the affordability, accessibility and availability of health care in this nation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dave Camp.","Rep. Dave Camp: Health care must be made available and affordable .

"London, England (CNN) -- On-form Wayne Rooney came off the bench to score the winner as Manchester United beat Aston Villa 2-1 in the English League Cup final at Wembley on Sunday. United manager Alex Ferguson opted to rest the England striker, preferring Michael Owen in attack alongside Dimitar Berbatov. Villa took the lead early on when James Milner converted a penalty after the pacey Gabriel Agbonlahor was pulled down in the box by Nemanja Vidic. Vidic was lucky not to receive a red card as he appeared to be the last defender. But United were back on level terms barely seven minutes later when Villa defender Richard Dunne lost the ball to Berbatov. Dunne's attempt at recovering the situation succeeded only in diverting the ball to the on-rushing Owen. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid frontman slid the ball first time past Brad Friedel and into the net. Owen, who has struggled to claim a regular starting place in the United side, was forced off just before the interval with a hamstring injury. The stage was set for his replacement, Rooney. The 24 year-old didn't disappoint as he nodded in a cross from Antonio Valencia with only 16 minutes remaining. After the match, Ferguson told Sky Sports he decided to drop his match-winner for the game because of the number of key matches coming up for the club -- including the Champions League second leg tie against AC Milan. ""There are a lot of big games coming up now and that's why we didn't play him today, but he's had 45, 50 minutes,"" he said. ""Michael Owen had a great first half, but unfortunately he got a hamstring injury and had to come off with that. Wayne comes on and scores the winning goal. With the form he's in you expect that.""

"(CNN) -- United States captain Landon Donovan is poised for a January switch to Everton after the English Premier League club confirmed talks were underway about a loan move. The 27-year-old, who has won a record 120 international caps, will lead his country against England in their opening group game at the World Cup finals in South Africa next year. The versatile Los Angeles Galaxy forward is expected to join compatriot Tim Howard on Merseyside from January 2 if negotiations are successful, and remain at Goodison Park until mid-March. ""Landon is a player who [manager] David Moyes has identified as someone he would like to bring to the club,"" chief executive Robert Elstone told Everton's official Web site. ""We are working to make that happen and hope we can reach agreement soon with all the appropriate parties."" Donovan has previous experience in Europe, having gone to Bayer Leverkusen while a teenager. But he failed to make an impact at the German club and was loaned to U.S. Major League Soccer outfit San Jose Earthquakes before joining the Galaxy in 2005. He spent a spell on loan at Bayern Munich at the start of this year, making six appearances, and then after a public falling-out with teammate David Beckham helped the galaxy reach the final of the MLS Cup. Donovan would join a growing list of American players in Britain, joining Howard and his fellow-goalkeepers Brad Friedel and Brad Guzan of Aston Villa, Fulham's Clint Dempsey and Eddie Johnson, West Ham defender Jonathan Spector plus Maurice Edu and DaMarcus Beasley at Scottish club Rangers.

"WIXOM, Michigan (CNN)  -- The lock on the gate is rusting, as are the ramps once used to drive shiny new Lincolns onto transport trucks. The giant sign that once carried the Ford logo is painted white, the factory is shuttered, and the jobs gone. Democrat Barack Obama polls well with Michigan's independent voters. In Michigan, the evidence of economic strain is everywhere -- from the vacant Ford plant in Wixom, to the barren lot a short drive away in Pontiac that was once home to a GM truck assembly line, to the empty storefronts with ""For Lease"" signs in the windows. With an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent and an unpopular Republican president, the political climate should favor Democrats, especially in Michigan, where 1988 marks the last time the GOP carried the state in a presidential election. But the new CNN/Time Opinion Research Corp. battleground poll shows a virtual dead heat, with Barack Obama holding a statistically insignificant 49 percent to 45 percent lead over John McCain. One reason McCain is within striking distance is his support in the critical Detroit suburbs, which include Oakland County and neighboring Macomb County. Those communities are heavily shaped by the fortunes of the auto industry and are known in national politics as the home of the legendary Reagan Democrats.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods, who suffered minor injuries in a car accident Friday near his Florida home, is not only the greatest golfer the world has ever seen, he is a true sporting phenomenon and one of the most recognizable faces in the world. The 33-year-old was the highest-paid professional athlete in 2008, reportedly earning an estimated $110 million from tournament winnings and endorsements. Although Woods has yet to pass Jack Nicklaus' overall record of 18 Major tournament victories, he is currently on 14 Major wins, there is little doubt that the Florida native is one of the most iconic sportsmen that has ever lived. Woods, who was nicknamed Tiger by his father Earl, who befriended a Vietnamese soldier of the same name, was destined from an early age to become a golfing great. Before he could walk, the baby Woods -- aged just six months -- was already imitating his father's swing, and at the age of two he famously appeared on the Bob Hope show to display his already considerable golfing skills. A year later, Woods played nine holes in a remarkable 48 shots and it was no surprise when in 1991 he became the youngest-ever winner of the U.S. Junior Championship at the age of 15. More success quickly followed, defending his junior title before becoming the youngest-ever winner of the U.S. Amateur Championship. In 1996, Woods turned professional and signed a reported $25 million five-year sponsorship deal with Nike, before claiming his first major with an astonishing 12-stroke Masters victory a year later -- the tournament's largest-ever winning margin. Three more Majors followed in 2000, the U.S. Open, British Open and U.S. PGA, before winning his second Masters in 2001 to become the first player ever to hold all four Majors at the same time, dubbed the 'Tiger Slam'. Success followed success through the decade with notable landmarks including breaking Byron Nelson's record for 114 consecutive cuts made on the PGA Tour while also passing the $40m career earnings mark in 2004 -- the year Woods married Swedish model Elin Nordegren. The death of father Earl in 2006 prompted Woods to take a nine-week lay-off from golf, following which he missed his first cut in 38 Majors at the U.S. Open. Woods became a father for the first time in 2007, when Elin gave birth to daughter Sam Alexis but in 2008 recurring problems forced him to undergo a third operation on his left knee. However, he continues to dominate the world golfing scene and proved he has lost none of his brilliance earlier this month when winning the Australian Masters after being paid $3.3 million just to appear in the tournament.","Tiger Woods is one of the most recognizable and iconic figures in the world .

"(CNN) -- Riding through the streets of Moscow or flipping through channels of Russian TV, it's difficult to escape messages from the country's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin visits the central control room at the Gazprom HQ, Moscow, January. ""I'm driving under a huge Gazprom sign right now,"" Yuri Pogorely, vice-president of Interfax, the Russian business news wire, said in a phone interview. Television ad campaigns have promoted the company as a ""national treasure"" and, more recently, the business that makes ""dreams come true."" ""It can make someone think, why does a Russian monopoly need this kind of branding? After all, there are other state-owned companies that don't present themselves as a symbol of Russia,"" Pogorely said. ""But Gazprom is not just any company."" If the Soviet Union promoted its interests through satellite states and military prowess, Russia today flexes its might on the global stage through its vast oil and natural gas fields. And no company exemplifies this more than Gazprom. ""By reputation, it is the largest and most powerful Russian company,"" said Lev Snykov, an analyst with VTB Capital in Moscow.  Watch Gazprom chief Alexander Medvedev explain future strategy » . But its strong-arm tactics in contract negotiations with the Ukraine -- shutting off gas supplies three times in the past four years at the height of winter -- have European Union customers looking for alternatives to their reliance on Russian natural gas. The company has the world's largest distribution system of gas, maintaining 97,560 miles (157,000 kilometers) of pipelines that stretch, like Russia, from the Far East to Europe. The perennial conflict with the Ukraine -- through which much of the natural gas supply of Eastern Europe flows -- is of deep concern to nations such as Germany and Greece, which depend on Russia for up to 50 percent and 90 percent of their natural gas, respectively. Gazprom saw its market share in the European Union drop in the second half of 2008. Gas exports from Russia to Europe dropped 33 percent in October alone, according VTB Capital. ""The Ukraine conflict may have served as a catalyst for European customers to become more averse to Russian gas imports,"" says a VTB report on the Ukraine crisis. The Russian economy, reliant on commodities, is suffering because of the fluctuating oil market, down from its record of nearly $150 a barrel to about $60 today. As a result, Gazprom saw profits fall 84 percent in the last quarter of 2008, prompting the company to slash its dividend by 86 percent, to 11 cents a share. Russia has 20 percent of the world's gas reserves, and is the single-largest producer of natural gas. Gazprom posted profits of $30.8 billion last year -- down from $40 billion the year before -- and its business alone accounts for 10 percent of Russia's gross domestic product. So it's no surprise that Gazprom is a pet project of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. His replacement as president, Dmitry Medvedev, is a former chairman of the company. Putin's ""interest in Gazprom is very deep. As a journalist who writes about energy issues, I've seen him give very detailed information and knowledge about what's happening with the company and company logistics,"" said Pogorely of Interfax. ""When you hear him speak, it's like you're not talking to the prime minister of Russia, but one of the top company managers."" Alexander Medvedev, deputy chief executive officer of Gazprom Exports, deflects questions about the perception that Gazprom is a tool of Russian government and energy policy.  Watch Medvedev explain Gazprom's plans » . ""Nobody is challenging the view that Gazprom is a very special company, that we have a mixed capital structure, the majority of our shares are in the hands of the Russian government,"" he said. ""But the rest are in the hands of private shareholders, including private citizens all around the world."" The company's goal is to become an energy leader with a diversified portfolio around the world, he said. ""Like Alexander Ovechkin... not everyone enjoys him, but he's a leader, and we would like to perform as good as Ovechkin in hockey,"" he said, referring to the controversial Russian ice hockey star who was named Player of the Year this week by National Hockey League players. That sentiment echoes how Russians feel about Gazprom. A recent poll by the Public Opinion Foundation found one in five Russians under 26 would like to work for Gazprom. ""In rural areas, Gazprom is dramatically important for people because of our harsh winters,"" Pogorely said. ""Russians love someone big who sticks up for you. OK, sometimes they may not be very nice to you. But if he cares for you and makes your life better, that's OK,"" Pogorely said. ""But if you're doing business in Russia, Gazprom is the power you wouldn't mess with.""","Russia, single-largest natural gas producer, has 20 percent of global gas reserves .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Tiger Woods marked his first appearance in Australia in 11 years with his first tournament victory on the continent on Sunday. The American bounced back from a disappointing showing on Saturday to cruise to victory by two shots at the Australian Masters despite being infuriated by an over-enthusiastic photographer at Kingston Heath in the state of Victoria. The 14-time major winner's only dropped shot in his final-round four-under-par 68 came at the par-four 13th hole when he was snapped while in the middle of his approach shot. ""That got me right on my downswing,"" he shouted in dismay. But Woods, who was paid a reported $3 million to play in the event and was tied for the lead after 54 holes despite his 72 on Saturday, bounced back with his fifth birdie of the day at the 15th hole. ""I said yesterday I was thankful I was still in the tournament, but I kept myself in it and it allowed me to go out today and go for the chance to win,"" said Woods, who attracted unprecedented crowds of more than 25,000. ""It was going to be tough today. I had to make some birdies early and I was able to do that and was able to keep it."" Greg Chalmers, who had also shared the lead along with fellow Australian James Nitties, also birdied 15 and followed Woods' lead by parring the last three holes to card 70 and finish second on 12-under 276. Nitties finished fifth on 279 after carding four bogeys in his 73, with France's Francois Delamontagne (69) and American Jason Dufner (70) tied for third on 278. Defending champion Rod Pampling carded a final-round 73 to finish tied for 14th on four-under.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Yad Vashem, Israel's official Holocaust memorial, museum and research facility, has launched a YouTube channel in Farsi, the primary language of Iran. This is being added to the already existing channels in English, Hebrew, Arabic, Russian and Spanish. The Farsi YouTube channel contains a chronological description of the Holocaust, accompanied by video, photos, documents and artifacts. It also includes the ""Auschwitz Album,"" a multimedia presentation about the infamous Nazi death camp where more than 1 million Jews were murdered during World War II. Testimonies from Holocaust survivors are presented on the channel, several of whom attended the launching event held at Yad Vashem. The channel also features Holocaust historians speaking about contemporary anti-Semitism. ""Today, when there is so much disinformation and distortion easily available online, we provide an alternative to anyone who is interested in the truth,"" said Avner Shalev, chairman of Yad Vashem. Shalev affirmed to CNN that the Farsi channel is, in part, a countermeasure against the official Holocaust denial of the Iranian regime, ""and I do believe that there are those circles inside Iranian society, we know about them, who are making many efforts to get more information about the Holocaust."" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has questioned, repeatedly and publicly, whether the Holocaust actually happened. He went as far as organizing a conference in Tehran on December 11, 2006, titled the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust. The attendees included individuals who propagate that the Holocaust was a fabrication. Ahmadinejad himself in a speech given in June 2009 referred to the murder of six million Jews as ""the great deception of the Holocaust."" Ya'acov Handeli, a survivor of Auschwitz whose testimony is included on the YouTube channel said, ""Holocaust denial exists in many countries, and that is why it is important that people will see us, the Holocaust survivors, and listen to our testimony and learn about the events of the Holocaust also in Farsi.""","New channel contains a Holocaust chronology, with videos, photos, documents and artifacts .

"Washington (CNN)  -- President Obama told his war council Wednesday that the U.S. troop commitment to Afghanistan is not open-ended, and he asked for revisions to options he previously received for sending more troops, a senior administration official told CNN. The war council -- made up of top Cabinet, Pentagon and administration officials -- met with Obama for the eighth time to discuss a request by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan for up to 40,000 more troops. The meeting lasted more than two hours, according to the senior administration official. ""The president and his team discussed the length of time that it would take to implement the options he's been presented,"" the senior official said. ""The president believes that we need to make clear to the Afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended. After years of substantial investments by the American people, governance in Afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time to ensure a successful transition to our Afghan partner."" In particular, Obama pushed for revisions in proposed plans for troop increases to clarify how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to the Afghan government, the official said. The president's questions at the meeting could change how many troops eventually are sent to Afghanistan, as well as how long they would be there, according to the senior administration official. Before the meeting, Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, said the meeting would continue evaluating how best to carry out the mission in Afghanistan. Petraeus provided no specifics on options under consideration, but said the process is approaching completion. ""I think we are indeed nearing a decision on this very important topic,"" he said, emphasizing the need to focus on the mission of ensuring that Afghanistan ""does not once again become a sanctuary or safe haven for al Qaeda and the kind of transnational extremists that carried out the 9/11 attacks."" Earlier, a senior administration official and a U.S. military official independently told CNN that one option presented to Obama calls for sending about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in addition to the 68,000 already committed to the country. The military official said the plan would send three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade of about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000 troops; and 4,000 to 5,000 support troops. The combat brigades would be brought in gradually, in three-month intervals, according to the military official. The troops would be spread across the country, mainly focusing in the south and southeast, where much of the fighting is, according to the official. The military official said the option has been a favorite at the Pentagon in recent weeks. That is only one option, the senior administration official emphasized. Three other options, the official said, would be ""different mixes,"" or ""different components of it."" The senior administration official said Obama was expected to ask the war council meeting about cooperation the United States can expect from the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, civilian support the United States is willing to offer, and support the United States can expect from other countries. On Wednesday night, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that concerns have been raised recently by the U.S. Ambassador in Kabul about Karzai's ability to rid his country's government of corruption and mismanagement. All those factors could lead to ""further refinements"" or some ""greater elements being considered,"" the official said, adding: ""He's got to fine-tune this, put it all together ... for what direction best advances our interests."" Despite reports to the contrary, Obama has not decided the number of U.S. troops he will send to Afghanistan, White House officials said. Such reports are ""absolutely false,"" Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Anyone who suggests otherwise, ""doesn't have, in all honesty, the slightest idea what they're talking about."" White House officials would not say whether Wednesday's meeting with the war council would be Obama's last with that group before deciding on Afghanistan. They said he would continue to discuss the war effort in smaller groups in coming days, including during his trip to Asia, which starts Thursday. Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee urged Obama in a letter sent Wednesday -- Veterans Day -- to agree to the request for additional troops by U.S. military leaders in Afghanistan. The letter, signed by 10 GOP committee members, said success in Afghanistan will require local leaders and citizens being able to govern and secure their own country without ""substantial"" international assistance. ""This won't be perfect or easy, but it will allow America's fighting men and women to leave Afghanistan with honor, and it will enable Afghans to build a better, more peaceful future,"" the letter said. ""That is our goal, and we must stay in the fight until is is won."" Republican leaders have criticized Obama for taking so long to decide on the troop request, but Petraeus said the process of analyzing the situation has been ""very useful."" ""There has been a refinement of objectives; there has been discussion of various courses of action,"" he said. ""There have been explanations and discussions about how the civilian component of this will complement what is done by the work of our military troops. All in all, I think it has been a very productive couple of months that we have spent on this."" Also Wednesday, a new national poll showed Americans are split over whether Obama is taking too long to decide whether to send more U.S. troops to the war in Afghanistan. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey also indicated that, by a narrow margin, Americans think the president should listen to the recommendations of the generals in charge of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. According to the survey, 49 percent of people questioned say the president is taking too long to decide whether to increase U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan; 50 percent do not. ""There is a gender gap on this question, with most men saying Obama is taking too long and most women willing to give him more time,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""That's due in part to the partisan differences between men and women, but gender differences on the use of military force, and maybe even differences in how the genders make important decisions, can also be contributing to the split."" The poll indicates that 52 percent think Obama should listen to the generals, with 48 percent saying the president should take other matters into account as well. But a troop buildup remains unpopular, with a separate question indicating that a majority opposes sending more troops. Roughly one in five Americans opposes more troops, yet also thinks that Obama should pay attention to the U.S. military leaders in that country, Holland said. ""That suggests that a lot of people who don't support a troop build-up are unaware of Gen. Stanley McChrystal's request for a bigger U.S. military presence there,"" he said. ""And that, in turn, indicates that the military leaders in the field might provide Obama some political cover if he decides to increase troop strength there."" The poll also suggests widespread agreement among Americans that Afghanistan will never have a stable democratic government, with only one in 10 people questioned saying that will occur within a year, and one-third saying it will ever happen. Overall, 56 percent of Americans oppose sending more troops, while 42 percent favor increasing troop strength. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted October 30-November 1, with 1,018 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall sample. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser and Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","Obama discusses options with war council Wednesday afternoon .

"(CNN) -- A few dozen protesters picketed the restaurants of acclaimed chef Thomas Keller last weekend, over his use of an ingredient that has become a lightning rod in the culinary world -- foie gras. Chefs like Anthony Bourdain sing its praises, calling foie gras ""one of the 10 most important flavors in gastronomy."" ""It's one of the best foods in the world for a couple of reasons, and I think it's because it has this very unique trait which is that it is on one side, extremely rich, but on the other, extremely delicate,"" Ariane Daguin, the CEO and founder of D'Artagan, a gourmet food company that started 25 years ago supplying Americans with foie gras. French for ""fat liver,"" this delicacy comes from ducks and geese that are fed massive amounts of food in the last weeks of their life. Foie gras is used in terrines and mousses, and by more adventurous chefs, shaved cold to add a creamy fat element to restaurant dishes. The force-feeding process, called gavage, causes the animals liver to expand up to 10 times its size. Anti-foie gras activists call the process cruel. Producers insist it doesn't hurt the fowl. ""We are the easiest target in the world for a couple of reasons, one our accent, it's called foie gras, it's a French word,"" Daguin tells CNN. ""Two it's an organ. It's easy to say that we don't need a meat organ to survive or to live. Three, it's expensive, so it's 'elitist,' and four, it's so easy for somebody just to take a look at the photo of the funnel inside the esophagus and to say 'Oh my god, if it were me, it would hurt.' Well, you are not a duck, so it is not you, you know? But it's so easy to empathize with the duck."" Foie gras has been produced by farmers since the days of ancient Egypt, when farmers discovered that the waterfowl's liver expanded in the days leading up to the bird's planned migration. The liver, in the center of the bird's body, stores fat the bird traditionally uses on long migratory flights. Only three farms in the United States produce foie gras. D'Artagnan gets its foie gras from Hudson Valley Foie Gras, two hours north of New York City, which produces about 375,000 pounds of the delicacy a year. Each foie gras sells for between $70 to $100 per lobe. At Hudson Valley, ducks are raised to 12 weeks before they begin the gavage process in pens 4-feet by 6-feet with 11 ducks in each enclosure, according to Marcus Henley, the farm's operations manager. Over 21 days the ducks are fed three times a day by a worker who uses a tube to fill the bird's esophagus with grain. At the beginning, each bird gets about 3 ounces of food, which increases to 10 ounces by the end of the program, Henley said, noting that the esophagus can hold up to a liter of volume. Each duck will yield a liver that weighs about 1.5 pounds. The rest of the bird is processed for its meat, remaining organs, bones and feathers. It's this feeding process that anti-foie gras protesters target with photos of the feeding tubes and banners that read ""How much cruelty can you swallow?"" ""The idea that you can produce the products that we produce -- that are a delicacy -- by mistreating animals is just completely, it's inconceivable,"" Henley says. ""It's not how farming is done."" Veterinarians say the bird lacks a gag reflex and their esophagus is lined with collagen, which makes it insensitive to pain. The bird breathes through a hole on the tongue. Still, protesters call the process a travesty. ""The whole point of the production method is to create this diseased liver, which is unlike any other form of animal agriculture where you're not just growing animals to be eating, but you're also torturing the animal to grossly enlarge its organs for consumption,"" Bryan Pease, an attorney and chairman of the board of the Animal Protection and Rescue League, said. Foie gras producers argue against use of the word ""diseased."" ""When we force-feed ducks and geese and we stop the force-feeding, the liver recesses to normal,"" Daguin says. ""So we do not induce a sickness, we just use the natural propensity to expand the liver."" Those opposing the production of foie gras have succeeded in getting California to adopt a law that will make it illegal to serve or produce in 2012. A ban on the ingredient in Chicago, adopted in 2006, was overturned by the City Council 22 months later. ""The key will be both banning the sale and getting restaurants to just remove it voluntarily and not sell it,"" Pease said. ""They'll always be able to find a place to produce that is going to make it be legal. They'll just go to a country with no laws, like China. The key is either for consumers to stop eating it or for restaurants to stop selling it."" Pease says his group has hired staff in New York to begin to target Manhattan restaurants to have them remove foie gras from the menu or face protests. But foie gras producers say they're being targeted by people whose ultimate goal is a meat-free world. ""There cannot be an agreement because for vegetarian activists, no farm is a good farm,"" Daguin says. ""They don't want us to eat meat period. So eventually, if they were to succeed, once somebody is out of the picture, the next one will be the chicken farm down the road. There is no 'good' farm for activists."" Still, there may be middle ground. Chef Dan Barber, inspired by the work of a Spanish foie gras producer, Eduardo Sousa, has begun experimenting with  ""ethical foie gras,""  harvested from geese allowed to roam Stone Barns Center in Pocantico Hills, New York., foraging for food, according to their natural feeding cycles. Daguin says that even those without an interest in the delicacy should pay attention to this fight. ""What they should be interested in is making sure that the farming practices in the world are sound,"" she said. ""That they are not destructive -- to me that's the most important thing.""","Fois gras is liver from a force-fed duck or goose and is considered a delicacy .

"(CNN) -- Donna Zovko will have to wait to travel to Falluja to see where her son died in one of the Iraq war's most infamous attacks. Clockwise from upper left: Wesley Batalona, Mike Teague, Scott Helvenston, Jerry Zovko . ""My dream was to go for the fifth anniversary, and that didn't come true,"" Zovko said this week while visiting friends in Boston, Massachusetts. ""It's not that I'm afraid for me. But people with me on the trip would be in more danger."" Tuesday marks five years since her son Jerry Zovko and three other civilian employees of the Blackwater private security firm were ambushed in Falluja on March 31, 2004. Gunmen attacked vehicles holding Zovko, Mike Teague, Wesley Batalona and Scott Helvenston and set the vehicles on fire. Shocking images beamed around the world showed Iraqis celebrating in front of charred bodies strung up on a bridge over the Euphrates River. The remains were dragged through the streets.  Donna Zovko honors her son » . ""I didn't realize until way after the incident that he had been decapitated,"" said Helvenston's mother, Katy Helvenston-Wettengel, from her Florida home. ""They cut his heart out. How can anybody be that hateful?"" To identify his body, she said, investigators had to gather DNA samples from her son's children. A half-decade after the notorious attack, memories of the gruesome images have faded somewhat from the public eye, as the United States plans to reduce troop numbers in Iraq and a wrongful death suit brought by the four families heads to court-ordered arbitration. The families accuse Blackwater of failing to prepare the men for their mission that day. A 2007 House oversight committee report concluded that Blackwater ""ignored multiple warnings about the dangers"" and failed to supply armored vehicles, machine guns, sufficient intelligence or even a map. Blackwater responded by saying the experienced military veterans on the team ""had all of the resources they needed"" and were victims of a ""well-planned ambush."" In the days after the attack, Blackwater was largely silent beyond a statement that said, ""We grieve today for the loss of our colleagues and we pray for their families."" But the families said they ran into a stone wall trying to get details of what happened in Falluja. ""For the next three months, they never returned my calls,"" Helvenston's mother said. ""Our families were destroyed. We will never be the same."" For Zovko, the suit is not about money or punishment. ""I want to hear the truth,"" she said. ""I want to know what my Jerry was doing before the mission. Why they didn't they have the maps? I want to know who he spoke to last."" What makes this anniversary different from past years, she said, was an encounter this month in Boston with an Iraqi who claimed that he was at the scene of the attack shortly after the massacre. He offered Zovko new alleged details of the attack, which she says brought her comfort. The Iraqi man, whom she wouldn't identify, told her that the attackers did not appear to be targeting the motorcade containing her son and his three comrades. ""We used to think maybe the attack was done on purpose,"" she said. The news made her feel like ""I was lifted into the air,"" she said. ""For me, it was good. I miss my Jerry more today than yesterday."" The gruesome attack put the little-known North Carolina-based security company into the American lexicon and on the world stage. It also changed the course of the war. The House report called it a ""turning point in public opinion about the war,"" which led to the first major U.S. offensive in Falluja. The fighting lasted three weeks, killing 36 U.S. service members, about 200 insurgents and an estimated 600 Iraqi civilians, according to the report. In the ensuing years, Blackwater and other private security firms in Iraq received hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. government contracts. Tactics used by the private security firms sometimes created ill will among Iraqis and Blackwater in particular was criticized, even by some in the U.S. military, for its allegedly reckless use of deadly force. Erik Prince, Blackwater's founder and former CEO, dismissed such allegations as ""baseless"" after his company was criticized by the Iraqi government for an incident in which its guards killed 17 Iraqi civilians and wounded others while protecting a U.S. State Department convoy in Baghdad on September 16, 2007. ""To the extent there was the loss of innocent life, let me be clear that I consider that tragic,"" Prince said, adding that the Blackwater team ""acted appropriately while operating in a very complex war zone"" that day. Five ex-Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty in January to charges of voluntary manslaughter stemming from their involvement in the shootings. A sixth pleaded guilty to voluntary and attempted manslaughter. That same month, the Iraqi government refused to grant the firm an operating license, and the U.S. State Department announced that it will not renew its contract. In the two months since the exit of the Bush administration, Prince has stepped down as CEO and brought in a new leadership team. The company has changed its name to Xe, but Prince is still chairman. ""I think Blackwater's been punished enough,"" Zovko said, ""but they will be punished more. It's time our government makes some rules and regulations about what civilian contractors can do in their wars."" This week, Xe released a brief statement to CNN about the Falluja killings, saying the ""sacrifices of these brave men have not been forgotten. On the five-year anniversary of their death, the company continues to mourn their loss. Our thoughts remain with their families and loved ones."" Prince's promise . Both mothers seem to be making a conscious effort to control their anger five years on. ""I refuse to hate, but if I were gonna hate anybody, it would be Blackwater and Erik Prince,"" Helvenston-Wettengel said. ""I want Blackwater exposed for who they are, and I want them out of business."" Zovko said she relies on her Catholic faith to control her anger. In 2007, Prince told CNN he would be willing to meet with Zovko, but 16 months later, no such meeting has taken place. ""He hasn't honored his promise, but I believe he will,"" Zovko said. ""Sometimes I think he doesn't have a heart, but he really does."" Zovko said she wants to ask Prince, ""Where are my Jerry's three suitcases with personal things that I have never received?"" Also, she said Prince promised to invite Zovko to Blackwater's headquarters in North Carolina to see memorial stones and trees that were planted honoring the victims. ""That hasn't happened,"" Zovko said. Helvenston-Wettengel also said she'd like to meet with Prince. ""I'd like to look him in the eye, yeah. I'd say, 'How can you live with yourself?' "" CNN sought a response from Prince about his promised meeting with Zovko. Company spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said Prince had tried to meet with Zovko in early 2008 but was unable to ""due to scheduling conflicts."" Both mothers' sons went to Iraq after careers in the U.S. military. Jerry Zovko, a former Army Ranger, had gone as a security contractor to train Iraqi soldiers. When that contract ended in late 2003, he signed on with a different company, Blackwater, according to his mother. For Scott Helvenston, Iraq was just the final chapter of a colorful career for the former Navy SEAL, a life that included a job as a stuntman and consultant for Hollywood films. On the set of 1997's ""G.I. Jane,"" shot in Jacksonville, Florida, Helvenston put Demi Moore through a rigorous training program, his mother said, even managing to grab a small role as an extra. A divorced father of two, Helvenston told his mother he would return from Iraq in two months, she said. ""He was going to go over there and make a bunch of money and come back and give it to his ex-wife,"" she said. Zovko and Helvenston-Wettengel have become close friends in the years since the tragedy, but on this anniversary, the two mothers will not be together to share their support and grief with each other. ""Traveling is getting to be troublesome for us both,"" said Zovko, who plans to remain near her home in Bratenahl, Ohio, to attend morning and evening masses at Cleveland's St. Paul Croatian Church. Helvenston-Wettengel also said she plans to attend church Tuesday in her hometown of Leesburg, Florida. Legal setbacks . As for the families' wrongful death lawsuit against Blackwater, a federal judge in 2007 ordered that the case be taken out of the courts to be decided by a three-member arbitration panel. Senior U.S. District Judge James Fox sent the case to arbitration based on Blackwater's argument that the four victims had signed an agreement not to sue the company. A hearing is set for June 23. In court, Blackwater had argued that it was immune to such a lawsuit because, as an extension of the military, it cannot be held responsible for deaths in a war zone. At this point, Zovko said, both sides are losers. ""I lost my son, and Blackwater lost the dignity of the company they thought they were."" Helvenston said she wants the whole thing to just end, but events keep dragging it out. ""They won't let me let it go."" CNN's Wayne Drash contributed to this report.","It's been five years since killings of four U.S. contractors in Falluja .

"(CNN) -- In a special report for CNN's Eye on Russia week, Moscow Correspondent Matthew Chance travels across the vast country from the northern port of Murmansk in the Arctic to the southern city of Sochi on the Black Sea. Here Chance recalls some highlights from his epic journey. Matthew Chance undergoes cosmonaut training at Star City. Arctic Ambitions . MURMANSK -- What an incredible, surprising place to begin a journey. At latitudes where most other Arctic states maintain little more than a few isolated scientific outposts, Russia has an entire city of 300,000. In fact, Murmansk is one of the friendlier, more pleasant cities I have ever visited in this country. The northern air is rich to breathe; the strange Arctic light lends a magical glow to the landscape. And there's a cafe culture! We sipped cappuccinos in the Arctic Circle and made friends with locals who seemed genuinely pleased to be living in their frigid metropolis. You might think Murmansk is just a freezing monument to the Soviet Union's grim determination to settle citizens across its sprawling territory at any cost. But today it's as much a symbol of modern Russia's Arctic ambitions: a strong foothold in a region believed to possess vast natural resources. In the global race for control of the Arctic, Murmansk is giving Russia a crucial head start. Beast from the East . ST. PETERSBURG -- For a day and a half, we trundled through the tundra on board the Arctic Express to St. Petersburg --- plenty of time to watch the white blankets of snow that covered the land gradually disappear. But we had come to Russia's city of beauty to meet its beast. Nikolai Valuev stands an incredible 7 feet tall, is a heavyweight boxing champion of the world and a Russian sporting hero. He used to be known to U.S. boxing promoters as ""The Beast From The East"" -- but he didn't care much for the name. Now he prefers ""The Russian Giant"" which was absolutely fine with me. In fact, Valuev is disarmingly pleasant and soft-spoken. He told me he had to work hard on being extra nice simply to stop people from being frightened when meeting him. Now he concentrates on encouraging Russia's youth to take up boxing. The country, he says, is a potential hotbed of future champions. Valuev has found fame outside the ring too, starring in several Russian movies and writing a book. He also writes poetry. Star City . MOSCOW -- If you've got $30 million to spend, you might want to consider training to be a space tourist in Russia's Star City. This is the country's biggest cosmonaut training center and the next stop on our journey. Between 2010 and 2015 --- when NASA's space shuttle ends its missions, and until the new generation of U.S. craft come online -- Russia will be the only country to have manned missions into space, including to the International Space Station. NASA is now sending all its astronauts here to train in the Soyuz capsule, the vehicle on which they will depend to carry them through their missions. And the training is vigorous. I know because someone, somehow, convinced me to sample it! Ever been strapped in a centrifuge and subjected to the same G-force as a cosmonaut taking off in a Soyuz? I have, and I didn't like it.","Moscow Correspondent Matthew Chance travels across Russia by train .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In making ""Into the Wild,"" Emile Hirsch forded rivers in Alaska, coped with blazing desert heat and rode raging rapids in the American Southwest. Emile Hirsch has starred in ""The Girl Next Door,"" ""Lords of Dogtown"" and now ""Into the Wild."" But ask him about a dangerous location he dealt with during the production of the Sean Penn film and he answers, ""South Dakota."" South Dakota? It seems that Hirsch had a couple close calls while shooting scenes on a farm in the other Sunshine State. At one point, while in a grain elevator set to handle 300-pound loads, Hirsch took out the pin holding the elevator in place. The platform rose with such speed that it ""launched me in the air and shot wood chips all over me"" when it hit the top, he recalled. ""Into the Wild,"" based on Jon Krakauer's bestselling book, is the story of Chris McCandless, whose good-natured restlessness drove him in search of soul-searching adventure.  Watch Hirsch talk about life on the road » . As he traveled through the West and Upper Plains on his way to Alaska, McCandless met farm workers, itinerant old hippies, a philosophical old man and a variety of other people, establishing short-lived relationships as he made his way along the road. At director Penn's urging, the Los Angeles-raised Hirsch (""The Girl Next Door,"" ""Lords of Dogtown"") stayed true to McCandless' spirit throughout filming, to the point of losing more than 40 pounds off his already slight, 5-foot-7-inch frame. ""That was part of the commitment of the role,"" he said. But the impact of the film went beyond that, the actor said in an interview at CNN Center. ""It's presumptuous to say I am changed,"" he said, but added that the shock of going from ""civilization to the middle of nowhere"" had its effect. ""A lot of Hollywood seems pretty ridiculous [now],"" he said. ""L.A. seems pretty goofy."" Of course, that's nothing like the shock of going from the wilds of Alaska to the green-screened studios of Berlin, Germany, where he just finished principal photography of next summer's big-budget production of ""Speed Racer."" ""There was a point where I was sitting in this green cockpit ... strapped in, getting rotated and spun around,"" he recalls, ""and I was thinking about this: I went from being in the mountains with a big grizzly bear to being strapped in ... I'm not making it very easy on myself, am I,"" he recalled. He describes ""Speed Racer,"" a Wachowski brothers (""The Matrix"") film based on the 1960s cartoon as ""a really crazy, Andy Warhol-meets-'Blade Runner' kind of big colors, pop-art, really crazy special effects, very goofy movie."" With ""Into the Wild"" now safely in Hirsch's past, what he thinks about -- besides the outdoor travails -- was his work with several notable performers, including Catherine Keener, Hal Holbrook, William Hurt and Vince Vaughn. ""It was so much fun to go to all of these locations and work with different actors,"" he says. They didn't work with each other, he observes, but ""I had the experience of being with all of them. I kind of connected them."" E-mail to a friend .","Emile Hirsch stars in ""Into the Wild""

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A magistrate in Zimbabwe ruled Friday that Tendai Biti, the secretary-general of the opposition party, must face trial on charges that include treason. Tendai Biti, a leading opposition figure, is facing treason charges after returning to Zimbabwe. Magistrate Mishrod Guvamombe said the state had enough evidence to disclose an offense against Biti, a high-ranking member of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). ""After a careful perusal of the submissions by both the state and defense, there is a reasonable suspicion that the accused [Biti] committed the offense,"" Guvamombe said to a full courtroom. As the magistrate read the ruling, Biti -- still wearing the red jacket he wore a day earlier -- remained motionless and only shook his head before prison guards whisked him away. Biti's defense team has requested he be granted bail while he awaits trial. Acting Attorney General Bharat Patel was expected to decide on the request later Friday. Biti faces four charges including treason, which carries the death penalty. The treason charge, which the MDC said was ""trumped-up,"" stems from a document titled ""The Transitional Strategy"" that Biti is said to have written ahead of the March 29 election between President Robert Mugabe and MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai. Biti denies he wrote the document and his lawyers have described it as ""doctored."" From the same document stem two other charges of causing dissatisfaction among the army and bringing the office of the president into disrepute. The fourth charge Biti faces is communicating falsehoods prejudicial to the state by allegedly announcing that Tsvangirai had won the March presidential election by an outright majority. Results announced by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission five weeks later indicated that while Tsvangirai had beaten Mugabe, he had failed to garner a majority.  Watch Mugabe say he'll fight to keep is party in power » . That outcome set up a runoff election, now scheduled for June 27. Biti denies all the charges, which the MDC calls ""maliciously politically motivated."" The party called for Biti's immediate release. ""The regime wants to frustrate both the internal cohesion of the MDC and its election campaign,"" the party said in a statement Friday. ""The regime knows fully well that its time is up and is trying to postpone the inevitable -- its departure. ""Come the 27th of June we will finish this regime of thugs and warlords and usher [in] a new era of jobs, health care, education and general prosperity."" African and international leaders have criticized Biti's arrest and the treason charge, characterizing it as a ploy by supporters of Mugabe to intimidate the opposition party before the runoff. The MDC has claimed that Mugabe supporters have beat, kidnapped, arrested and killed supporters of their party. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice accused Mugabe on Thursday of sponsoring efforts to starve, beat and kill supporters of his opponent so he can win next week.  Learn more about Zimbabwe » . ""Mugabe is increasing violence against [the] opposition,"" Rice said at the UN. ""President Mugabe has squandered the promise of the very nation that was hailed as the jewel of Africa."" The MDC has accused supporters of Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party of beatings, torture, and killings, saying more than 70 MDC party members have been killed since the beginning of the three-month-long election process. Mugabe's party denied any part in the deaths, saying MDC officials hurl such accusations frequently.","Magistrate rules Tendai Biti must face trial on charges that include treason .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Flo Rida wants you to call him. Flo Rida's latest single, ""Right Round,"" was No. 1 on Billboard's pop chart for 10 weeks. In an attempt to reach his fan base on a more intimate level, the Floridian rapper has made his personal cell phone number public. ""If they can go out and buy my albums, I can at least make the sacrifice to holler at the few people who call,"" he says. ""A lot of times I'm busy so they'll get my voice mail. And if I can speak to them and I have time, I always text back. Because I think that's very important."" To prove that the number he shared on camera during our interview was the real deal, he showed CNN his iPhone. The device was on overdrive, constantly lighting up and vibrating with an influx of texts and calls. ""Yo this is your boy Flo Rida,"" he said to one caller. ""What's your name? What's good?"" But it was too much for the person on the other end -- he or she hung up before uttering a response.  Watch Flo Rida take a call » . ""Most of them hang up,"" says Flo Rida (real name Tramar Dillard). ""They don't think it's really me."" So how many calls and texts does a top-selling, in-demand rap star actually respond to? ""About 30 percent,"" he says. Flo Rida has been moving quickly these days. His single, ""Low,"" featuring T-Pain, broke digital sales records last year, selling 467,000 downloads in its first week. He's also breaking his own records: His new single ""Right Round"" sold more than 636,000 downloads in the week after its release. It also hit No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 pop chart. ""Right Round"" features singer Kesha and borrows an infectious sample from the Dead or Alive hit ""You Spin me Round (Like a Record)."" It can be found on Flo Rida's sophomore album, ""R.O.O.T.S."" (Atlantic), which dropped last week, only a year after the release of his debut album, ""Mail on Sunday."" Flo Rida is also scheduled to be a guest on Wednesday night's ""American Idol."" Flo Rida talked to CNN about having to record music while on the road, keeping in tune with his international fans, and being a shy guy (yeah, right!). The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: In ""Right Round"" you sample the '80s group Dead or Alive. Are you a fan of '80s music? Or [do] you just like that song in particular? Flo Rida: I grew up [with] seven sisters so I listened to all types of music. And Dead or Alive was one of the records in particular that I've heard. But my A&R [man] Mike Caren actually brought it to my attention. Me putting out a sophomore album, I thought I'd broaden my horizons, show people my growth, so I got in the studio with Dr. Luke, who's the producer of the song, and we made history. CNN: Seven sisters? Flo Rida: Yeah. I'm the youngest. And I have a twin sister. I'm a twin. CNN: What does ""R.O.O.T.S."" stand for? Flo Rida: Route of overcoming the struggle. CNN: What do you mean by ""struggle""? Flo Rida: I was definitely inspired by the fact that I had a chance to go to Africa recently, did the MTV Awards there. ... But going back to my neighborhood, you know, I had a lot of struggling, too, where it was a lot of drug dealing around me, killing. ... But my mom always instilled in me to keep the faith, dream big and that's what I did. I was a great follower of my mom, very loyal and everything. And right now I'm happy that the world looks at me as a great leader as far as me doing my music and coming with a positive approach. CNN: Your first hit song, ""Low,"" broke digital sales records. How did that change the pace of your career? Flo Rida: We had to hurry up with the album and put it out because we definitely want to keep the attention on the fact that we have a No. 1 record, and let that follow into having a No. 1 album. I'm definitely happy that on this album versus the last, there's more substance so at the same time the fans get a feel of me ... where I come from, how I got the success as well as me being the life of the party. They can continue to have a smile on their faces around the world. Hit the dance floor, shake it off, put your hands in the air and ... the hot ladies have my head spinning right round so I definitely had to get that album out. CNN: It has barely been a year since you released your debut album, so you're really striking while the iron's hot. Are you putting this pressure on yourself or is it mainly coming from outside forces? Flo Rida: The most pressure came from traveling. I actually found myself in hotel rooms in the bathroom, whether I was in Japan or in Sweden, recording records, trying to get an acoustic sound. I definitely worked hard ... it was just a challenge as far as time goes, with me doing two -- sometimes three -- shows a night for two weeks straight. I enjoy doing all the shows and performing, but at the same time all that work -- and trying to put out an album -- was definitely hectic. CNN: You've worked hard to build up your overseas fan base. Why is having a global audience important to you? Flo Rida: It's very important ... the loyalty that they have overseas. You have a No. 1 record in almost 12 different countries: To me, that's like having nine lives. Most people don't even have an idea that you can really sell music overseas. I always love the fact that I can do things internationally. When I was going to school I took the approach that I wanted to take international business versus just taking business classes. So I always had that approach prior to me doing music. CNN: Are you surprised by how responsive the rest of the world is to American rap? Flo Rida: Most definitely. Sometimes they don't even know the language, and they can repeat a song. CNN: Some might say that your music is less rap and more good-time club jams. Would you agree with that? Flo Rida: People can have their own thoughts of what they think it is. But for the most part I'm happy that they know it's music. CNN: What kind of feedback do you get when you have a hit record? What do people tell you they like about it? Flo Rida: At this moment everybody wants to be a rock star, so it has that vibe in it. The way I ride a beat definitely gets everybody's attention. And in using a Dead or Alive sample intertwined with what's going on here in the new millennium is definitely what catches everyone's attention. CNN: What's your dream collaboration? Who would you really like to work with? Flo Rida: Andre 3000. I've always been a fan of OutKast. Every time they drop an album they step it up a notch. And there's a lot of diversity between Andre and Big Boi. CNN: What is the quirkiest thing about you? Flo Rida: Most people see me on stage and they think that I'm this crazy dude, but for the most part I'm a little shy and laid back.","Flo Rida enjoying popularity of single ""Right Round""

"(CNN)  -- If you think this is the year George Clooney will finally settle down, don't hold your breath. In an interview airing on Friday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" he told both Morgan and his own father that his one marriage, to actress Talia Balsam that ended in 1993, was enough. Morgan pointed out that George's father, Nick, who appeared on the show with him, had ""one of the great marriages."" Nick Clooney has been married to his wife, Nina -- George's mother -- for more than 50 years. Morgan asked whether, as a parent, Nick was ""yearning for the moment"" his son would walk down the aisle. Nick Clooney turned to his son and said, ""I want you to think about that. I want you to think about -- we've been married -- Nina and I've been married 51 years."" ""I hate to blow your whole news story,"" said the younger Clooney, ""but I was married, so I gave it a shot."" Clooney said the ""shot"" he gave marriage ought to have ""proven how good I was at it."" Clooney also said his dad taught him that he has an inherent responsibility to share his luck and good fortune with others. Clooney said his father urged him ""to help look out for people that are less fortunate than you and to challenge people that are in power."" Clooney also said his career luck came late and pointed out that his acting successes came relatively late. ""I did eight television series before ""ER"" hit and if we didn't get a Thursday night at 10 o'clock time slot, you know, I wouldn't have the career that I have."" When Morgan asked Clooney if he was considering following in the footsteps of other Hollywood A-listers who ventured into the political arena, the actor dashed any hopes of a President George Clooney: ""Honestly, my job is as good as they get."" ""I think that I am best suited as an advocate for issues,"" said Clooney. ""And I look to people who are far smarter and far better at this than I am to lead."" His primary issue now is the situation in Sudan. Earlier this month, Clooney continued his ongoing humanitarian efforts to shed light on deadly violence in the troubled border area of Abyei. Clooney was a firsthand witness to the voting process that will most likely lead to independence for Southern Sudan. Clooney also told Morgan he contracted malaria while in Sudan, but said he's no longer infected with the disease, and even made light of the situation, saying, ""Even with malaria, it's just good fun."" Clooney, who has been infected with malaria twice, joked, ""I guess the mosquito in Juba looked at me and thought I was the bar."" When Morgan asked whether Clooney gets angry when people say he's wasting his time in Sudan and that his charity work is for ""self-aggrandizing reasons,"" Clooney told Morgan, ""I don't need to be more famous."" ""I've got all the attention I need,"" Clooney continued, ""and I'm just trying to use that attention on other people."" Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- Don Shows was a computer geek until he lost his job and took a road trip. JetBlue promises to refund some tickets purchased before a traveler is laid off from a job. While the 56-year-old from Dayton, Ohio, was away on his eight-day post-layoff adventure, he decided he really wanted to be a photojournalist. ""I ran into some interesting situations when I was out touring around the backcountry"" of the Midwest, he said. ""The road map is handy, but sometimes the road you're looking for is not there."" Stories like Shows' are more common these days. The unemployment rate was at 7.6 percent in January, and, strange as it may seem, at least one travel company, an airline and a travel-bag maker are now catering to the layoff crowd -- both the recently let go and the future unemployed. For those who buy a plane ticket before they get the ax, JetBlue is offering to refund fares. The JetBlue Promise promotion is good for customers laid off on or after February 17 and applies to ticket purchases made between February 1 and June 1. The program is designed to appeal to people who haven't been downsized but worry they might be, said Alison Croyle, a spokeswoman for the airline. ""It's something that we felt would provide an advantage to customers who otherwise might be too stressed to book future travel plans,"" she said. Then there's the already-laid-off demographic. On some packages, Intrepid Travel is giving a 15 percent discount to people who've recently been let go. The deal, with the tongue-in-cheek title, ""Laid off? How about taking off?"" has gotten a few dozen takers in the two months it's been offered, said Leslie Cohen, spokeswoman for the travel company. Cohen said the discount is designed to give people a chance to clear their heads during a tough transition. Some of the deals start at less than $1,000, she said. The company is ""not suggesting you use your life savings,"" she said. ""It's really just a chance to catch your breath and see something else and come back in a little bit of a different frame of mind."" For those looking to hit the skies on the job hunt rather than escape it, SkyRoll, maker of a $149.99 garment bag, says it's giving a discount. ""If you recently lost your job and need to travel for an interview, we will take 50 percent off the price of a SkyRoll to help you arrive looking your best,"" the company says on its Web site. To get the discount, SkyRoll requires customers to e-mail the company a layoff notice. Travel discounts like the one from Intrepid may be great for unemployed people who have hefty savings accounts or large severance packages, but the program also could prey on the unemployed, said Madeline Hughes, who runs a consulting and outplacement group in Denver, Colorado. The cost of a big trip ""could be lunch money for somebody for the next six months,"" she said. Hughes tells her clients who are laid off they need to come up with a career plan -- and quickly -- because the job market is so competitive. If a person truly has a thick enough checkbook to afford a post-layoff vacation, Hughes said she would tell the person to send out plenty of resumes before hitting the beach. ""If you really do want to get away, then at least get somewhat of a plan so when you're on vacation you're not fretting about what you're going to do when you get back,"" she said. ""People can't relax if they're afraid and they don't have a plan and they're sort of panicked."" Daphne Domingo, a life coach in Seattle, Washington, said people who've been laid off should take vacations so they have time to reassess their lives -- but they should gauge the scope of their travel on their savings account. ""Be a tourist in your own town"" if you don't have the money to travel, she said. ""That way, you can save money on accommodations."" Domingo and Hughes said all job seekers should weigh their situations individually. Jonathan Hagelstein, a 32-year-old from New York, plans to use Intrepid's package to travel to Africa and Europe for nearly a month. This is the second major trip he's taken since being laid off from a finance job in June. But Hagelstein says he's a ""compulsive saver"" and wants to make use of the free time while he has it. ""Time is something that you can never get back. You can always earn more money,"" he said. ""I'm not getting any younger. ... This is an opportunity -- I feel -- of a lifetime."" With each trip, he hopes the job market will be better when he returns. He said he has no leads on a job. Shows -- the man from Ohio, who first shared his story on iReport.com, CNN's user-submitted content site -- took off on a road trip as a way to reanalyze his life. See Shows' story on iReport.com . He said he hadn't taken a substantial trip during the decade or so he worked in information technologies at LexisNexis, a database and information company. So he saw the layoff partly as a gift of free time. Shows said he has a stable enough income since he is also a retired police officer. But he said his car trip was relatively cheap. The adventure took him to six states and cost less than $1,000, he said. Plus, it helped him reconnect with his passion. ""If I could do anything I wanted to do in life, it would be to take the camera out and go out to talk to people and get stories,"" he said. Shows said he plans to take photojournalism classes at a local community college this spring.","Travel companies and an airline are catering to the layoff crowd .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It's fair to say David Beckham may be seeing more green off the football pitch than he does on it. Reason to smile: David Beckham is the highest-earning footballer in the world, according to Forbes . Despite a difficult and expensive period negotiating an extended release from his LA Galaxy club -- Beckham has been named as the world's highest-earning footballer by Forbes magazine. The magazine has ranked the top 20 top-paid footballers in the world -- a list that includes many of today's top players and some ageing heroes who are still rolling in cash. The 33-year-old Beckham, currently on loan with Italian club AC Milan as part of an extended deal from LA Galaxy, earned an estimated $46 million last year, according to Forbes. It calculates that the Briton has earned $95m in the past two years -- $66m of which has come from endorsement contracts. Although his long-running deal with Pepsi ended in December last year, his currently resurgent career is likely to provide a boost for the coming few seasons. Behind Beckham in the Forbes list is his Brazilian AC Milan team-mate, Ronaldinho, who earned an estimated $33m in 2008. Rounding out the top five places are (respectively); Thierry Henry, Kaka and last year's FIFA World Player of the Year, Cristiano Ronaldo. See our gallery of the top twenty highest-paid footballers in the world, according to Forbes » . Ronaldo's earnings of $21 million came primarily from his Manchester United wages ($12m), while endorsements from companies such as Nike and Coca-Cola made up the remaining $9m. The Portugal player's namesake -- Brazilian Ronaldo -- is still on the list at number 12, having earned $15m despite being sidelined for much of the year with a serious knee injury and returning to his homeland to play club football. Partner in the Sports Business group at Deloitte, Dan Jones, told CNN that only a ""tiny percentage"" of footballers earned more from product endorsements than they do from their player wages. ""It's only the very, very top. For the vast majority of footballers, the wages they earn from their clubs will be their greatest source of income."" Jones said Beckham's continuing popularity beyond the world of football in both the U.S. and in Europe would likely ensure he remains around the top of the rich list for a few years to come. ""He is now a grand icon that in some sense transcends what he does on the football field,"" Jones said. However, Jones added he was impressed with the way Beckham had made strong efforts to reinstate his image as being primarily a footballer over the last 18 months.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- A Nigerian militant group tangling with government forces in the country's southern oil-producing region declared ""an all-out war"" Friday after what it said was a deadly bombing raid on civilians. Militants from the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta have declared war on Nigerian troops. The military, meanwhile, pressed ahead against the fighters, wresting control of a hijacked tanker and capturing a militant stronghold. The developments are the latest in the escalating hostilities between the government and the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, which demands that more of the country's oil wealth be reinvested in the region instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians . In e-mail messages to reporters, the militant group said it sank six army gunboats, destroyed three others and captured three in the restive Niger Delta region. ""Many soldiers have been killed, and the military has made a hasty retreat,"" said the group, which is calling on ""men of fighting age to enlist"" in its battle against government forces. Also, the group said, it had captured personnel from a Nigerian warship deployed from Liberia to help the military and was ""in the process"" of torching the vessel. ""We have some casualties on our side, obviously,"" a militant spokesman said. ""Obviously, the battle is more serious as night comes."" Col. Rabe Abubakar, spokesman for the Nigerian military's joint task force, confirmed exchanges of fire between government forces and militants and reported the seizure of a militant camp, saying one soldier was wounded and the militants ""suffered a lot of casualties."" The troops are conducting cordon-and-search operations designed to nab militants in their suspected hideouts along the southern region's creeks. Abubakar said that the military conducted a successful ""rescue"" mission of a recently hijacked oil condensate tanker, and that the captain and the crew, some foreign, were safe. The militant group said Nigerian troops fired stray bullets that killed a Filipino ""hostage"" on the ship in Delta state, but the Nigerian military couldn't confirm the killing of a ""foreign hostage."" The violence, which has included attacks on pipelines and hostage-taking, has limited shipment of crude oil supplies out of Nigeria. The militant group said Friday the country's armed forces conducted ""indiscriminate aerial bombardment on the defenseless civilians in the Gbaramatu area of Delta state."" It said the strikes were punishment ""for the humiliating defeat"" of the army in raids on two militant camps Wednesday. ""Casualties are mostly women, children and the elderly who could not get away quickly into the bush or high sea,"" the militant group said. It also repeated its ""directive"" for oil companies in the region to ""evacuate by the deadline of midnight today and cease oil production until further notice."" The military made reference to the directive, saying it is responding to attacks on troops, hijackings of vessels and threats to innocent people, such as the ""expatriates who were given ultimatum to leave the region by the militants."" It characterized the various claims by the militants as ""propaganda."" ""We are not at war with any individuals or groups in the region,"" Abubakar said. ""Ours is to protect lives and property and also to rid the region of criminals who hide under the guise of struggle agenda to perpetrate crime.""

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria's military has rescued 18 hostages held by militants in its oil-rich Niger Delta region, a military spokesman said Monday. File image shows Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta fighters. The first group -- nine Filipinos and five Nigerians -- were released on Saturday, while four Ukrainians were released on Sunday, according to Col. Rabe Abubakar, spokesman for the Nigerian military's joint task force. Nigeria's military began clearing the western Niger Delta region last week, its first major operation against the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, an armed militant group that demands a better distribution of the country's oil wealth. Both the Nigerian military and the militants have said the ongoing fighting has resulted in a high number of casualties. As many as 1,000 have been killed, according to Victor Burubo, a spokesman for the Ijaw National Council which represents the region's largest ethnic group. However, aid groups and journalists have been unable to verify that figure. ""We want the international community to know that we are getting rid of criminals and terrorists in our communities so foreigners who come here to work and invest are safe,"" Abubakar said. Four villages near the militants' camps have been destroyed in the fighting, Burubo said. However, the military spokesman stressed that Nigerian forces are not targeting civilians, blaming such attacks on the militants. ""We are not attacking villages -- just (militant) camps,"" Abubakar said. On Friday, MEND declared ""an all-out war"" on the government after what it said was a deadly bombing raid on civilians. It is not the first declaration of war by MEND, which demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be reinvested in the region instead of enriching those the militants consider corrupt politicians. The militant group declared war against the government in September for what it said were unprovoked attacks. At that time, MEND destroyed several oil facilities, forcing Nigeria to cut its oil exports by as many as 1 million barrels of oil per day, or 40 percent. The recent violence -- which has included attacks on pipelines and hostage-taking -- has limited shipment of crude oil supplies out of Nigeria, Africa's largest producer. MEND has threatened to blockade oil vessels, and has warned oil companies in the region to leave and ""cease oil production until further notice.""

"(CNN) -- Freed Iranian-American journalist Roxana Saberi thanked friends and family Tuesday for their support during her ordeal in an Iranian prison, and said she plans to spend the next few days relaxing. Roxana Saberi smiles ouside her home in Tehran, Iran, on Tuesday. ""I am, of course, very happy to be free and to be with my parents again,"" a smiling Saberi, 32, told reporters. Saberi, who was dressed in a black tunic and a blue headscarf, said she was only now learning of a global support campaign on her behalf.

I just want to be with my parents and my friends and to relax."" Reza Saberi, her father, said they plan to leave Iran soon. Saberi was convicted last month on espionage charges in a one-day trial that was closed to the public. She was sentenced to eight years in prison after being accused of spying for the United States. A judge changed Saberi's sentence during an appeal hearing Monday. The court agreed with her lawyers that, because Iran is not at war with the United States, Saberi cannot be punished for cooperating with agents of a hostile nation, according to Saberi's spokesman, Abdolsamad Khorramshahi. Her sentence was changed to a two-year jail term, suspended for five years, Iran's state-run news agency IRNA reported. Saberi was detained in January after initially being accused of buying a bottle of wine and working as a journalist without proper accreditation, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an advocacy group. She was soon charged with espionage. Saberi went on a hunger strike while imprisoned, but her father said she has since put on some weight.","Father of Roxana Saberi says they plan to leave Iran soon .

"New York (CNN) -- A 19th-century artwork by French artist Edgar Degas will be handed back to the French government Friday -- nearly four decades after it was stolen. The painting, ""Blanchisseuses souffrant des dent"" (""Laundry Women with Toothache,"") was taken in 1973 from the Malraux Museum in Le Havre, in Normandy, France, the U.S. District Attorney in Eastern New York said. It had been on loan from the French government, which considers the painting a national treasure. The piece did not resurface until October this year when it appeared in a catalog from the auction house Sotheby's, it said. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the French government will take part in a repatriation ceremony at 1 p.m. at the French ambassador's residence in Washington D.C. to return the painting. U.S. customs officials, working with authorities from INTERPOL, said the painting was consigned to French art collector Ronald Grelsamer. Grelsamer said his father gave him the painting as a gift, but was unaware that it was stolen, the statement said. Sotheby's said they had nothing indicating that the painting was stolen, saying it did not appear in any of its lost art databases, said company spokeswoman Diana Phillips. The auction house had a longstanding relationship with Grelsamer without incident, she added. ""Sotheby's is happy to have been able to be involved in this discovery, and we are pleased that this painting will be returned to the government of France,"" Phillips said. The U.S. District Attorney office says that Greslamer intends to seek compensation for the painting. ""The return of this masterpiece to the French government reflects our commitment to ensure the return of stolen artwork and cultural patrimony,"" it said in a written statement. The 6.25-inch-by-8.5-inch piece -- painted between 1870 and 1872 -- has an estimated value of $350,000 to $450,000, the statement said, quoting the company catalogue. The painting reflects a break from the academic focus of Degas' early years when he dedicated himself to the ""search for the essence of modern life,"" said Sotheby's spokeswoman Lauren Gioai. ""The 1870s gave rise to some of Degas most celebrated works,"" she said.","19th-century painting will be returned to France almost four decades after it was stolen .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Former President George H.W. Bush is getting his old foreign policy team back together on the 20th anniversary of the Gulf War. The reunion is being held on the Texas A&M University campus in College Station, where the Bush presidential library is located.

Iraq invaded on August 1990, declaring Kuwait its 19th province. The United States led a counter-offensive starting January 16, 1991. The United Nations lifted Saddam-era sanctions against Iraq in December, a largely symbolic step toward Iraq regaining full sovereignty and its status in the international community. More than 1,000 people -- or their remains -- are still missing, including Iraqis, Kuwaitis and others. Iraq is also continuing to pay off its war reparations to its neighbor. Baghdad says it has paid about $30 billion to date and still has to pay more than $20 billion more. The money is deducted from Iraq's main income, oil revenues.","George H.W.

"(CNN) -- It could be argued when Tony Blair left the office of Prime Minister in June, his parting from the public stage was mourned by few but chief among those mourners were Britain's satirists. The characteristics of the Blair government with its emphasis on spin and sound bites created a wealth of material for top British satirist Craig Brown. Dubbed ""the wittiest writer in Britain today,"" by comedian Stephen Fry, Brown's new book The Tony Years celebrates a decade of satire that Brown thought would never end. He writes: ""For years, he seemed so permanent; it was hard to imagine that Tony Blair would one day become a forgotten figure, like Harold Wilson or Sir Anthony Eden. He seemed more ubiquitous than Mrs. Thatcher in her prime. Perhaps this was because she was so unique (or so peculiar, according to one's taste) while Tony was an archetype, a familiar figure from all our pasts: the eager boy with his hand in the air throughout double maths; the well-spoken estate agent; the energetic youth leader, full of exciting new ways to cross a river."" Brown has been satirizing British politicians and celebrities for almost 30 years in a variety of publications from The Spectator to the Guardian. He writes regular satirical columns in both the Daily Telegraph and Private Eye where targets are as disparate as feminist Germaine Greer, 'glamour model' and author Jordon and playwright Harold Pinter. While Brown's writing is consistently witty, clever and often laugh out loud funny, Brown himself is softly spoken and self deprecating. ""I'm not actually funny in real life,"" he says. ""Usually people can do one of the two (write with humor or speak with humor) there are hardly any people who can do both like Stephen Fry."" Occasionally Brown will perform his work before an audience, which he enjoys (""I rather like reading my parodies out. There nothing like having an audience laughing"") but the life of a satirical writer is often one that's quite isolated from his audience. Instead he is quite happy working from his home in the country and keeping a low profile. He admits to only visiting the offices of employer, The Daily Telegraph twice (""I never know quite what to do with myself in an office"") and spending a large part of the day in his pajamas. He even shy's away from calling himself a satirist -- a term he thinks has become loaded: ""I used to think of myself as a satirist but satirists are people who really want to be politicians. Satire is an unfunny form of humor and it has an agenda that works against the comedy. Satirists think they can change the world, and that's an illusion."" Part of success as a satirists (or humorists as some like to be called) is to capture the not just the personality they are satirizing but the zeitgeist of the times. For Brown part of the zeitgeist of the Blair years are CCTV, ASBOs, binge drinking, the acceleration of the cult of celebrity but most of all spin: ""Publicity was all: privacy dwindled."" The thirst for spin extended to unlikely quarters observes Brown: ""I couldn't believe it when the Freemasons appointed a PR -- even a secret society wants to raise the profile. Peculiar but also funny."" ""As for Blair -- there were things about him that were very funny. There was the spin which John Major hadn't developed and that's always funny -- its also funny parodying conference speeches. They are always parodied baby-talk, lower than banal -- those were funny with Blair."" Brown parodies New Labour's conference speak in The Tony Years as sounding like this: ""I believe in Britain. Great! A country with a great history. Great!... I want a Britain that we can all feel part of. I want a Britain in which what I want for my own children I want for yours- but only after I have got it for mine."" Brown's inclination towards satire started young. A pupil at Eton, he coped with being away from home at a young age by mimicking teachers. ""I was at a boarding school since I was 7 and I had a tape recorder: all the people you are terrified of you can reduce. We did their voices and dramatizations. English prep schools when you're very young and you are threatened by these very gothic figures; it's (mimicking) a way of reducing people."" Over the years his parodies have hit the mark, sometimes a bit too closely. One target, Germaine Greer ""was very touchy when I first met her (but) angry people are always funny to parody."" He says the journalists he has parodied ""are more touchy than politicians. Politicians are aware they are being hated from the moment they are elected."" But Brown doesn't feel guilty about upsetting his targets. News reporting has the capacity to inflict greater wounds, says Brown. ""Other forms of journalism are more hurtful. The raw materials of journalism can hurt people a lot more. The act of printing is the original hurt and the gags come later. I used to worry if the targets liked or disliked them -- now it doesn't matter. Now it doesn't matter if they like it or not."" Brown admires satirists that reduce things ""to the essence of itself."" He's keeping an eye on new Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who will present different challenges from Blair: ""I think Gordon Brown has an anger in him. Everyone says how awkward and controlling he is -- it will surface soon."" And the satire won't be too far behind.

"(CNN) -- The world's top-ranked women's tennis players, Caroline Wozniacki and Vera Zvonareva, have crashed out of the Australian Open warm-up event in Sydney in their opening matches. After receiving a bye in the first round, Danish top seed Wozniacki won just six games as her Slovakian opponent Dominika Cibulkova cruised to a straight-sets 6-3 6-3 win on Tuesday. Russian second seed Zvonareva -- winner of last week's Hong Kong Classic exhibition event -- put up more of a fight in her first match against Italy's Flavia Pennetta, but eventually succumbed 7-5 7-5 to the world number 24. The results are a blow to both players' preparations for the Australian Open, the first grand slam of this year beginning in Melbourne on January 17. Poland-born Wozniacki had won her last nine sets against Cibulkova, but the world number 32 made a quick start, breaking serve in the opening game before taking the first set. After trailing 2-3 in the second, she took four straight games to secure her first win over Wozniacki, who is attempting to cement her place as the world's best player with her first grand slam victory in 2011. She lost in the fourth round in Melbourne last year. ""At the start of the new season you need to get into match play. I didn't feel I was playing great tennis out there,"" the 20-year-old Wozniacki told the official WTA Tour website. ""Now I just need to get some training matches, head to Melbourne and get ready for the Australian Open. Last year I had the same start, so hopefully slow start, good finish."" Wimbledon and U.S. Open finalist Zvonareva could now drop a place in the rankings next week after her defeat by former top-10 player Pennetta. Belgian third seed Kim Clijsters, who booked her place in the quarterfinals with a straight-sets win over the Czech Republic's Barbora Zahlavova Strycova, would replace Zvonareva as world number two if she progresses further in the tournament. The triple U.S. Open champion next faces seventh seed Victoria Azarenka, following the Belarusian's 7-5 6-3 triumph over Israel's Shahar Peer. In the other women's second-round matches completed on Tuesday, China's Li Na battled past French qualifier Virginie Razzano 6-4 1-6 6-4. The eighth seed set up a third-round meeting with Russia's former world number two Svetlana Kuznetsova, who upset home favorite and fourth seed Sam Stosur in three sets. In the men's draw, past Sydney finalist and former top-20 player Juan Ignacio Chela recorded his first win at the event in eight years beating Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic in three sets. The Argentine's next opponent will be France's Richard Gasquet after the fifth seed claimed a late-night straight sets victory over Australia's Matthew Ebden. In other completed first round matches, number seven seed Guillermo Garcia-Lopez of Spain beat home favorite Chris Guccione. And Italy's Potito Starace and Andreas Seppi defeated Julien Benneteau of France Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan respectively. On Monday, former world number five Juan Martin Del Potro returned to winning ways with a first-round win. The Argentine overcame Spanish sixth seed Feliciano Lopez in three tie break sets to book a second round tie with Germany's Florian Mayer. At the ATP event in Auckland, New Zealand on Tuesday, Argentine former world number three David Nalbandian beat Italy's Fabio Fognini in straight sets to get his 2011 campaign off to a winning start.

"ANTIOCH, California (CNN) -- Phillip Garrido and his wife, Nancy, will face 29 felony counts after being accused of kidnapping Jaycee Lee Dugard when she was 11 and keeping her in their backyard since 1991, the district attorney of El Dorado County, California, said Friday. Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender, was arraigned in California on Friday. The Garridos are each facing charges of kidnapping someone under 14 years of age, kidnapping for sexual purposes, forcible rape and forcible lewd acts on a child. The maximum penalty for both defendants would be life imprisonment. Authorities are looking into Garrido's possible connection to other crimes.  Hear interview with Garrido » . A search warrant was issued for Garrido's home in connection with killings that occurred in the 1990s, a spokesman for the Contra Costa Sheriff's Department said Friday. Pittsburg, California, police obtained the search warrant, said the spokesman, Jimmy Lee. Earlier Friday, a California sheriff also admitted that his organization ""missed an opportunity"" nearly three years ago to find Dugard. Someone called 911 on November 30, 2006, to say that a woman and young children were living in tents in the backyard of Phillip Garrido, said Sheriff Warren E. Rupf of Contra Costa County, California, on Friday. ""This is not an acceptable outcome,"" he said.  Watch Rupf talk about the 'missed opportunity' » . The responding sheriff's deputy spoke with Garrido, a registered sex offender, in the front yard of his house. ""None of us, particularly law enforcement, should believe a word that one of these animals utters,"" Rupf said when asked about the lessons learned from the missed opportunity. ""If there's a sophistication [about sex offenders] in any regard, it's in misrepresenting who they are and what motivates them. ""We took things he said obviously at face value and did not properly brand him."" Rupf also said that ""to the best of his knowledge,"" the deputy didn't know that Garrido was a sex offender. The deputy determined that no crime had been committed even though he did not enter or ask to enter the backyard, the sheriff said. ""We should have been more inquisitive, more curious, and turned over a rock or two,"" the sheriff said. ""We missed an opportunity to bring earlier closure to this situation."" Dugard lived for 18 years in a shed and other outbuildings behind her abductor's house, where she gave birth to two girls whom he fathered; the girls are now 11 and 15, police said. CNN policy is not to publish the names of victims when there are allegations of sexual assault. In this case, Dugard has been the subject of a 20-year public search and her image and name have been widely disseminated, making protection of her identity virtually impossible. Dugard was kidnapped in 1991 as her stepfather watched, helpless, in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe, California.  Learn about some missing children who have been found alive » . Investigators arrested Garrido on charges of kidnapping and abusing her after police discovered Dugard on Wednesday. ""The last 18 years have been rough, but the last two days have been pretty good,"" her stepfather, Carl Probyn, told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Friday.  Watch Probyn describe getting the news » . Phillip Garrido, 58, and 54-year-old Nancy Garrido were arraigned Friday in Placerville Superior Court in Placerville, California. They pleaded not guilty Friday. During their time living in Garrido's backyard, Dugard and her two children apparently rarely ventured out of their compound, investigators said. Dugard ""was in good health, but living in a backyard for the past 18 years does take its toll,"" El Dorado County Undersheriff Fred Kollar said. He described her as ""relatively cooperative, relatively forthcoming"" in discussions with detectives. She was ""in relatively good condition,"" neither obviously abused nor malnourished, he added. ""There are no known attempts by her to outreach to anybody."" The children didn't go to school or to the doctor's office. Now they and their mother are being thrust into a strange new world. On Friday, Dugard began the long process of reuniting with her family.  Watch about recovering from captivity » . Terry Probyn, who is separated from Carl, spoke with her daughter Thursday and learned that she had two daughters of her own, he said. Carl Probyn said he expects Dugard and her two children to come back to Southern California, since ""that's where we all live."" Garrido apparently maintained a blog in which he claimed to control sound with his mind. The blog now has numerous profanity-laced responses from people outraged over his alleged actions. In a rambling telephone interview from jail, Garrido told CNN affiliate KCRA of Sacramento that he was relieved at being caught. ""I feel much better now,"" he said. ""This is a process that needed to take place."" The investigation went years without apparent progress until Tuesday, when Garrido showed up on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley with his two daughters and tried to get permission to hand out literature and speak, Kollar said. He did not know the subject of either the literature or the planned talk. Police officers ""thought the interaction between the older male and the two young females was rather suspicious,"" so they confronted them and performed a background check on him, Kollar said. That check revealed that Garrido was on federal parole for a 1971 conviction for rape and kidnapping, for which he had served time in the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. The two female police officers contacted Garrido's parole officer, who requested that he appear Wednesday at the parole office.  Watch police talk about why they arrested Garrido » . Garrido did just that, accompanied by his wife ""and a female named Allissa,"" Kollar said. The presence of Allissa and the two children surprised the parole officer, who had never seen them during visits to Garrido's house, Kollar said. ""Ultimately, Allissa was identified as Dugard,"" Kollar said. Scott Kernan, undersecretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said Garrido admitted having abducted Dugard. Dugard's presence behind Garrido's home since apparently went unnoticed in the neighborhood, where homes on one-fourth to one-half-acre lots typically sell for less than $200,000, said Kathy Russo, whose father has lived two houses away from the Garridos for 33 years.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A meeting between the leaders of Pakistan and Afghanistan was canceled Friday when bad weather prevented Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari from traveling to the Afghan capital, Kabul. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari (pictured) has met Afghan counterpart Hamid Karzai before. An official in Pakistan's Foreign Office said the meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and top government officials will be rescheduled for the near future. The visit was to have taken place amid ongoing warfare and tension along the Afghan-Pakistan border and was to have focused on the nations cooperating in the fight against terror. Some of the Taliban militants conducting attacks in Afghanistan have been based in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province and nearby tribal regions. The group's resurgence has prompted U.S. commanders and the incoming Barack Obama administration to put more of a focus on confronting militants along the volatile border. In the past, Afghan and Pakistani leaders have blamed the other for the security problems in the region. Zardari was to have been accompanied on the trip by the governor of North West Frontier Province, as well as his foreign minister and adviser on internal affairs. The two presidents also planned to discuss the expansion of bilateral relations and trade. Both men have met before, when Karzai visited Pakistan in September to attend Zardari's swearing-in ceremony.","Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari due to meet Afghan President Hamid Karzai .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Two Egyptians allegedly tried to set themselves on fire but security guards stopped them from carrying out the acts, an Egyptian Interior Ministry official confirmed to CNN Wednesday. The incidents occurred in Cairo Tuesday, and both men were arrested on suspicion of trying to burn themselves. Sayed Ali Sayed, a 65-year-old retired accountant, was stopped outside the Egyptian parliament building by guards who found him carrying gas canisters, said the official, who wants to remain anonymous because he's not authorized to speak to the media. Sayed's motives are not known. Mohamed Ashour Mohamed, a 53-year-old former EgyptAir employee, attempted to set himself ablaze in protest to being fired three years ago. The man said a court order to give him his job back was never enforced, the official said. The men's attempts are the latest in a series of self-immolation incidents that began last month in restive Tunisia, when Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old unemployed college graduate, set himself on fire after police took away his fruit cart. Since then, more such incidents are being reported from other countries such as Egypt, Algeria and Mauritania -- where other people are turning to self-immolation, some for apparent social and personal reasons. In an incident Monday night, Ahmed Hashem Sayed, a 25-year-old unemployed construction worker in Alexandria, Egypt, slashed his wrists, set himself on fire, and died of his injuries, the Egyptian Interior Ministry official said. Two others in Egypt were injured in self-immolation attempts, one on Tuesday and the other on Monday. News reports from Mauritania say a man set himself on fire Monday in front of the presidential palace. In Algeria, security officials said Sunday that three people set themselves on fire. Riots and demonstrations have erupted in Algeria in recent weeks due to the rising cost of food, unemployment and housing issues.","Both incidents occurred Tuesday in Cairo .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As the lights went down in the theater the low murmur built to a thunderous ovation as the odd-looking man in the crumpled suit and bowler hat took to the stage. Tom Waits in Paris on the European leg of his tour. The excitement that greeted the eccentric American singer songwriter Tom Waits' appearance in Edinburgh last month may come as a surprise to the many, who have never heard of him. The 58-year-old has stayed for most of his four-decade career on the edge of the music mainstream. This is despite a showering of critical acclaim and a host of high-profile fans including the movie star Scarlett Johansson, who recently recorded an album of Waits covers. Waits' position on the periphery of pop music (he admits that the 60s scene largely passed him by), may be because he belongs to a bigger historical tradition -- that of the singer-storyteller that has its origin in folk music. His music comes from a different place from most artists. A laconic, bar room philosopher with a wry sense of humor, Waits is an avowed fan of the Beat generation writer Jack Kerouac and the author and poet Charles Bukowski. Many of his songs are stories containing a cast of characters from America's underbelly: the drunks and disenfranchised, the lost souls hiding out from life in seedy night spots. It is the same world that Kerouac chronicled in his writings, including his most famous work ""On the Road,"" which describes a journey across America in the late fifties. Waits, who is notoriously interview-shy, acknowledged his debt to the author in a promotional interview to accompany the release of his 1974 album ""The Heart of Saturday Night."" He said the record was a search for the ""center of Saturday night,"" a quest he said that Kerouac himself had ""relentlessly chased from one end of this country to the other, and I've attempted to scoop up a few diamonds of this magic that I see."" Waits' place in the folk tradition is something he has acknowledged, consciously or otherwise, in his music. In 1990, he wrote the music and lyrics for ""The Black Rider: The Casting of the Magic Bullets,"" a theatrical collaboration with the American writer William Burroughs based on a German folktale. Like all great writers, Waits is a conscientious observer of people and their strange foibles. Born in Pomona, CA. he moved to Los Angeles in the late sixties to pursue his music career, finding work as a doorman at an LA nightspot. It was at this time that he honed his skills as a storyteller, eavesdropping on the lives of others. ""I was picking up people's conversations in all-night coffee shops - ambulance drivers, cabdrivers, street sweepers,"" he said in an interview with The New Yorker. ""I did research there as an evening curator, and I started writing gingerly. I thought at some point I'd like to forge it all into something meaningful, and give it dignity."" The results of this labor are songs like ""Frank's Wild Years,"" a hilarious and sinister tale of a man -- Frank -- trapped in suburbia with a wife and pet dog that has a skin disease. The song is spoken in a lounge room style over a soft jazz accompaniment, and like much of Waits' work it drips irony: ""They had a thoroughly modern kitchen/ Self-cleaning oven (the whole bit)/ Frank drove a little sedan/ They were so happy."" In a 1983 promotional interview published by his then record company Island, Waits credits a short story by Bukowski with giving him some of the inspiration for the song. ""Bukowski had a story that essentially was saying that it's the little things that drive men mad,"" Waits said. ""It's not World War II. It's the broken shoe lace when there is no time left that sends men completely out of their minds. ""I think there is a little bit of Frank in everybody."" In the song, Frank eventually runs amok, setting fire to the family home and blazing a trail up the Hollywood freeway because, as Waits quips in the pay-off ""he never could stand that dog."" This taste for the absurd carried into his recent live show with the set for the ""Glitter and Doom"" tour decked in a bizarre array of old speaker cones. Waits took to the stage dressed in a Chaplinesque suit, delivering his set from a slightly raised platform that gave up a cloud of dust each time he bashed his feet into it. In spite of the entreaties from the crowd he kept quiet between songs at first. Eventually after a few numbers he broke his silence. ""This is a lopsided love song,"" he rasped, introducing the next track. ""By that I mean the person doing it is lopsided, not the song itself."" Lopsided or not, it's an authentic voice we could surely do with hearing more from.","Singer songwriter Tom Waits has won critical acclaim for his music .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- A man named Ernesto pressed an old-fashioned radio to his ear, listening to a baseball game roughly 5,000 miles away. Ernesto listens to the Baseball World Cup gold medal game by radio in Havana. The U.S. beat Cuba 10-5. ""Oh, it's already over,"" he groaned, listening to the staccato play-by-play of Sunday's Baseball World Cup championship. In the gold-medal game, played in Nettuno, Italy, team USA defeated Cuba, 10-5, to wrap up the World Cup played this year throughout Europe. In the winning country, that news likely was overshadowed in most places by Major League Baseball, professional football, or dozens of other sports stories that developed on Sunday. But in Cuba, where baseball is as much a source of national pride as it is a game, the Baseball World Cup was big news. Reverberations of that last out in Italy could be felt as far away as Havana's central park, where a daily gaggle of baseball fans often provide for the country's liveliest debate. ""The American pitching was strong,"" said Ernesto, still listening to the crackle and pop of his radio. ""But Cuban batters were not as good,"" he added. For the widely anticipated match-up, Havana residents holed up in their homes Sunday afternoon to watch their national team take on their northern neighbor on TV. Those without televisions huddled around a small radio in the capital's central park, appearing to hang on every broadcasted pitch. ""Strike three!"" the radio sputtered as another Cuban batter was retired by U.S. starter Cory Luebke, who tallied seven strike-outs in four-and-a-third innings. He prompted a near-unison groan among the group. The United States, led by Los Angeles Dodgers prospect Lucas May, scored early and often as May put the Americans ahead with a second inning three-run home run. The Cubans refused to go quietly, rallying in the fourth inning and scoring two runs on three singles. A two-run blast by Cuban first baseman Ariel Borrero in the sixth inning tied the game at 4-4 before a salvo of U.S. hits in the seventh drove in six runs, enough  to secure the American win. For team USA, the contest capped a 14-game winning streak that began after a first-round loss to Venezuela. Sunday's win is only the fourth U.S. championship in World Cup competition, with Americans having previously earned gold in 1973, 1974 and 2007. For the Cubans, whose teams have brought home gold in 25 of the last 30 Baseball World Cup championships their country has played in, it was time to start looking ahead in quintessential baseball philosophy. ""They won it this year, but we will win it the next,"" said one Havana resident who declined to give his name. Long a baseball powerhouse, Cuba has never finished out of the top three in World Cup competition, according to International Baseball Federation spokesman Jake Fehling. But million-dollar contracts in professional baseball often have lured away top Cuban prospects and depleted national team talent, pulling star athletes such as Orlando ""El Duque"" Hernandez and Jose Contreras away from state salaries at home. Cuban pitcher Ardoldis Chapman, who defected in July during a national trip to the Netherlands, is the latest example of top Cuban players seeking the bigger payoffs of major-league salaries. Chapman, a lefty who reportedly throws over 100 mph, has sparked rumors of a potential bidding war among top major-league franchises. Residents in Havana's central park, however, were unwilling Sunday to say more than a few words about the loss of star talent. ""If they leave, they leave,"" Ernesto said, still clinging to his radio. Players come and go, but in Cuba, baseball -- and baseball talk -- is one steadying constant. And in Havana's central park, the talk of Sunday's game -- the talk of baseball -- buzzed on, long after the last pitch was thrown.","Havana residents flock to radios, TV to watch Baseball World Cup title game .

"(CNN) -- Issam Al-Chalabi worked as Iraqi oil minister from March of 1987 to October 1990. He left Iraq shortly after the invasion by Saddam Hussein of Kuwait in August 1990 and retired from government service in 1991. Since then he has been working as a consultant in Amman, Jordan. John Defterios caught up with Mr Chalabi at the Oil and Money Conference in London this week to ask him about what's driving surging oil prices, the future of the Iraq Oil Industry, and tensions in the region. Issam Al-Chalabi: None of us had expected that £93 would be reached so quickly. There had been some speculation that maybe $100 is achievable but I think it has happened too fast within the past few weeks. It is related to so many factors, so many elements and so many reasons. You cannot just say that it is a result of the value of the dollar. Definitely it is one hell of a factor because the value of the dollar has depreciated compared with six major currencies in the world. John Defterios: But let's take a look first at demand here. Some economists are scaling down their expectations for growth in the U.S. and in Europe. Is the demand outside of the G8 strong enough to underpin the prices that we see today? IC: Yes of course, everybody now is talking about the increasing quantities and demand from China and India. China will certainly consume as much oil as the United States, maybe in 2020. The same thing with India. The rate of growth is increasing tremendously. And there is going to be a strong demand in general, maybe not as much from Europe and the G8 countries, but definitely from the new giants. JD: What is your biggest concern politically in the region right now? We're talking about tensions between Turkey and Northern Iraq and the Kurdish region. And you say there is not a lot of production coming out of that area, but the tensions could overspill into Iran. What's the potential down for here? IC: I don't think that the tension between Turkey and the Kurds will have much influence on the price of oil. But Iran, with the question of the nuclear file and the possibility of the U.S. taking military action against Iran, that is a possibility. Why? Because you have about 18 to 20 million barrels a day that are being exported through the Gulf. And whether Iran blocks the Strait of Hormuz or they retaliate by attacking some oil installations in the region, then you have 18 or 20 million barrels a day off the market. If this happens, don't be surprised if you reach $150 or even $200. JD: In Iraq right now, they're talking about a national oil law. That's in draft form. Will that actually be the subject that breaks Iraq apart? IC: Oil certainly could be one major element. If the politicians who are running the country now go ahead and try to divide the oil wealth among various regions as they had drafted in the revenue-sharing law, then I would say that is going to lead to the break up of the country. JD: Meanwhile we have different regions like the Kurdish region signing contracts with U.S. and European oil companies for production agreements. Will these contracts be recognized in the next year as valid? IC: They started, or in fact they never stopped, negotiations with a number of companies. So within the last four or five weeks, they have signed five different contracts. One of them is American, and that's the one that made the news, and that is Hunt Oil. And all these contracts, according to the central government, are illegal. This is because they have not been done with the blessing of the central government.

"(CNN) -- The Jonas Brothers have canceled a planned concert in Monterrey, Mexico, they announced Thursday, following an outbreak of drug-related violence there. The pop trio said they were saddened not to be going through with the show, scheduled for October 21. ""While they wish to apologize to everyone who planned to attend the concert, this difficult decision was made out of their great affection and concern for their loyal fans in the region,"" their management said in a statement. The Disney-backed boy band will go ahead with concerts in Guadalajara on October 23 and Mexico City the following day, the statement said. Monterrey tickets can be exchanged for tickets to those concerts or refunded at the place of purchase. Moneterrey has seen a wave of violence as rival drug gangs battle each other and the police. There have been at least three grenade attacks this month. One was thrown at a police station on October 10, wounding four police officers. Fourteen people, including eight children, were injured when a grenade was thrown in a public square in front of a city hall on October 3, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing local officials. At least three grenades were thrown in the vicinity of the U.S. consulate in Monterrey late on October 1, a consulate employee told CNN the next morning. The consulate does not appear to have been the target. A local newspaper reported that a guard at a local courthouse was injured by shrapnel in that incident. Monterrey is one of Mexico's leading business centers. It is the capital of the state of Nuevo Leon, which has witnessed much violence as rival drug cartels fight with each other over lucrative smuggling routes and with the federal authorities.","Monterrey, Mexico, has seen at least three grenade attacks this month .

"(CNN) -- Longtime film critic Roger Ebert, who lost much of his jaw to thyroid cancer, will show off his new face -- thanks to a prosthesis -- when his PBS show debuts this weekend. The creators of the prosthesis ""did a pretty wonderful damn job,"" Ebert wrote in his online blog, which provided a few photos. ""I like my new prosthesis and know from observation their work was painstaking and done with love and care."" The process of crafting the silicone prosthesis and matching it to his face and features took about two years, Ebert said. The effort was led by Dr. David J. Reisberg. Since the cancer, Chicago-based Ebert, 68, has been unable to speak or eat conventionally. He has used various text-to-speech technologies to provide a voice. According to ""Entertainment Tonight,"" the Chicago Sun-Times critic is producing and will appear in brief segments in his new show ""Roger Ebert Presents At the Movies,"" which launches on PBS stations nationwide. ""I will wear the prosthesis on the new television show,"" Ebert wrote in a Wednesday evening post entitled ""Leading with my chin."" ""That's not to fool anyone, because my appearance is widely known,"" said Ebert, who appeared with the late Gene Siskel on a movie review show for more than 20 years. ""It will be used in a medium shot of me working in my office, and will be a pleasant reminder of the person I was for 64 years."" Ebert wrote he initially assumed he would wear the prosthesis all the time when he leaves the house. But his thoughts have changed, in part because people know what he looks like beneath the feature. ""And something else has happened since that day in the hospital: I accept the way I look. Lord knows I paid the dues.""","Longtime film critic lost part of jaw to cancer .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich returned to the top of the Bundesliga for the first time since May 2008 with a 2-0 victory at home to Hoffenheim on Friday night in the first match after the German winter break. Louis van Gaal's team climbed a point above halfway leaders Bayer Leverkusen, who host Mainz on Saturday. Third-placed Schalke can also move above Bayern with victory at home to second-bottom Nuremberg on Sunday. Van Gaal was again without the services of playmaker Franck Ribery, who is expected to return from injury in the trip to Werder Bremen next weekend, but the club insisted before the match that all efforts will be made to keep the France star, a reported target of Real Madrid and Chelsea. But Dutch forward Arjen Robben was fit to start as 21-time league champions Bayern continued the form that saw them win six consecutive matches at the end of last year, while captain Mark Van Bommel returned from suspension in front of a capacity 69,000 crowd at the Allianz Arena. Argentina defender Martin Demichelis opened the scoring in the 35th minute, with the center-back stabbing home from close range after Hoffenheim's Josip Simunic headed a cross from Bastian Schweinsteiger into his path. Germany striker Miroslav Klose came off the bench to replace the injured Ivica Olic and score his first league goal in nine months. With four minutes of regulation time remaining, he guided a speculative shot from Van Bommel into the net after the midfielder was set up by Robben. Mario Gomez, who started up front with Olic, had a miserable match as he hit the post in stoppage time to add to four earlier misses. Hoffenheim, who topped the table 12 months ago before an alarming slump in form that saw them miss out on a place in Europe, were left in seventh place with 25 points from 18 matches -- 11 adrift of Bayern.","Bayern Munich return to the top of Bundesliga table for first time since May 2008 .

"(CNN) -- The Venezuelan government initiated a new charge against a private television broadcaster and said that 29 additional radio stations would soon be closed, the latest move in what critics call a crackdown on freedom of expression. Demonstrators hold up a picture of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at a pro-Chavez rally on Saturday. The Saturday announcement by Minister of Public Works and Housing Diosdado Cabello, who oversees the state telecommunications regulator, came at a counter-rally to marches protesting the hardline tactics of President Hugo Chavez. Friday's marches against Chavez were in part to protest the government's closure of 32 radio stations and two television broadcasters last month. The government said the stations were shut down for violations relating to their broadcast licenses. Critics say the president was clamping down on critical press. ""There are 29 [radio stations] that will be off the air shortly,"" Cabello said at Saturday's pro-Chavez rally. Cabello also announced a new legal complaint against television broadcaster Globovision as a sanction for allegedly calling for a coup against Chavez during its coverage of Friday's rallies. Globovision carried text messages from viewers on a ticker on the bottom of the screen during the anti-Chavez protests that called for an overthrow of the government, Cabello said. ""If you call for a coup, if you call for assassination, assume your responsibility,"" he said. The government has already initiated a number of charges against Globovision. The station, known for being critical of Chavez, is being investigated for breaking a law on ""social responsibility"" on some programs on certain dates. The station violated a statute that makes it illegal to utilize telecommunication channels to further criminal acts, the government alleges. Venezuelan authorities had also opened an investigation into whether Globovision broke the law May 4 when it reported about an earthquake before an official report had been issued on the matter. Two other investigations had previously been launched against the station. The relationship between privately-owned media in Venezuela and the leftist Chavez have never been rosy. Chavez has accused private television stations of supporting his brief ouster in 2002, and the president was a driving force behind denying a license renewal in 2007 to one broadcaster he said cooperated with the opposition.","Venezuela says 29 more radio stations to be closed; 32 already shut down .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Iraq's parliament has passed a $58.8 billion budget for 2009 after cutting $3.2 billion from government spending because of weak oil prices, a Iraqi lawmaker said. The Iraqi presidential council, including Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, still must approve the spending plan. The three-member Iraqi presidential council, including Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and his two deputies, still needs to approve the spending plan. The budget, adopted Thursday, was calculated based on $50 a barrel, said Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman. Crude oil currently is trading around $44 a barrel, and Iraq's oil-dominated economy has taken a beating due to the world financial downturn. According to the Iraqi parliament Web site, Iraq still would expect to run up a deficit in 2009 of about $15 billion. The original budget proposals made in July totaled $79 billion. As a part of the trimming of government spending, Othman said that the Iraqi parliament voted to reduce the salaries of key officials by 20 percent. Those affected include members of the presidential council, including the speaker of the parliament and his two deputies, the Iraqi president and his two vice presidents, the prime minister and his two deputies and the chairman of the judiciary council and his two deputies.

"(CNN) -- Italian teenager Federico Macheda enjoyed a remarkable debut to English football as he curled home an injury-time winner that sent Manchester United back to the top of the Premier League with a thrilling 3-2 home win over Aston Villa. Macheda receives a hug from manager Sir Alex Ferguson after scoring Manchester United's last-gasp winner. It seemed United would have to settle for a point after Cristiano Ronaldo's double had only proved enough to keep United level against a Villa side that thoroughly deserved a lead provided by John Carew and Gabriel Agbonlahor. But 17-year-old substitute Macheda, a former member of the Lazio academy who arrived at Old Trafford in 2007, was to have the last word. Who is Federico Macheda? At exactly the same moment as Yossi Benayoun struck for Liverpool at Fulham on Saturday, Macheda turned onto Ryan Giggs' low pass before unleashing a stunning shot that curled past Brad Friedel and sent Old Trafford into ecstasy. United, missing a host of players including Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes, started poorly against an out-of-form Villa side who had gone eight matches without victory. However, a stunning piece of skill from Cristiano Ronaldo gave them a 14th- minute lead. James Milner and Friedel got themselves into a muddle, forcing the Villa keeper to handle a back pass. The resulting free-kick saw Ryan Giggs brush the ball to Ronaldo, who sent a fierce shot over the wall and into the roof of Friedel's net in a flash. Villa were not to be denied and they drew level when Gareth Barry wriggled his way into space by the touchline and Carew crept between Gary Neville and John O'Shea to steer a deft header into the bottom corner of the net. The visitors then took a deserved lead on the hour mark when Ronaldo gifted possession to Stiliyan Petrov, who swept upfield unopposed. He found Carew, whose perfect cross was headed home by Agbonlahor. The goal stung United into life and they levelled with 13 minutes remaining when Michael Carrick exchanged first-time passes with Giggs on the edge of the Villa box, before presenting Ronaldo with a lay-off. The world player of the year did not have a lot to aim at but he found the one small gap Friedel was unable to cover. A draw would have been a fair result, but United poured forward and in the third minute of five added on minutes at the end of the match, Macheda delivered the killer blow to leave the defending champions a point clear of Liverpool at the top with a game in hand. Meanwhile, in the day's other match, Everton moved to within one point of Villa in sixth position after a comfortable 4-0 victory over Wigan, courtesy of a double from on-loan Manchester City striker Jo.","Federico Macheda scores an injury-time winner as Manchester defeat Villa 3-2 .

"RITTMAN, Ohio (CNN) -- Donna Zovko walks to her son's grave. Tears stream down her face and she begins trembling amid a steady rain. She kisses her right hand and with it strokes her boy's headstone. Donna Zovko stands next to her son's headstone. A wreath with 36 roses marks Jerry Zovko's birthday. Three and a half years ago, she watched on TV as the bodies of her oldest son, Jerry Zovko, and three of his Blackwater colleagues were dragged through the streets of the Iraqi city of Falluja, burned and mutilated. As horrifying as the pictures are, Donna Zovko -- a Catholic -- finds comfort in an image of her son's body before the mobs got to him. His eyes were closed, his mouth open, as if he were calling God ""to take his soul."" ""I just hope that he was referring to the Holy Mother or calling God to help him,"" she says, just steps from where her son is buried.  Watch remembering ""my Jerry"" » . Donna Zovko also hopes that she will get some answers as to how -- and why -- her son died. Blackwater officials have not been forthcoming, she says. After seeing Donna Zovko's story on CNN, Blackwater Chairman Erik Prince said of her: ""I would be willing to meet with her without media present, out of fear of it becoming a media circus."" Donna Zovko would welcome such a meeting. ""I would like that. It would be one of my prayers answered. Maybe he'll tell me the truth,"" she says. Then, she adds: ""Why does it have to be 44 months before they tell us anything?""  Watch a mom's message to Erik Prince: ""Tell the truth"" » . Two weeks ago, on October 26, Donna Zovko was at the Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery to celebrate her son's birthday. A wreath adorned with 36 white roses -- 32 for his years alive and four for the birthdays he's missed -- stood next to the grave. Three yellow roses sat next to the headstone with a hand-written note: ""Happy Birthday Jerry."" ""I miss him more today than yesterday. But I love being here,"" his mother said. Jerry Zovko, a former Army Ranger, had gone to Iraq as a security contractor to train Iraqi soldiers. When that contract ended in late 2003, he signed on with a different company, Blackwater, according to his mother. On the mission in Falluja, he and his comrades Scott Helvenston, Mike Teague and Wesley Batalona were killed when they were ambushed in their two vehicles as they escorted three empty flatbed trucks. It was the death of Zovko and his comrades that led to the first major U.S. offensive in Falluja, lasting three weeks, and killing 36 U.S. servicemen. Donna Zovko, a Croatian immigrant whose original name is Danica, told CNN.com that Blackwater chief Prince paid a personal visit to her to inform her of her son's death. He also attended the funeral, and the company held a memorial service for her son and the other slain guards. After that ceremony, she said, she and her family were taken to a private room where they pressed for more details about the events surrounding her son's death. She said she didn't get answers. A congressional committee had a similar complaint about Blackwater not being forthcoming. In late September, the House Oversight Committee released a report on the deaths of Zovko and his three colleagues, saying Blackwater had ""delayed and impeded"" its investigation of the killings. ""Blackwater agreed to the Falluja mission before its contract officially began, ignored multiple warnings about the risks involved and did not provide its team with adequate equipment, intelligence or directions,"" the report said. ""Mistake apparently compounded mistake."" Blackwater has taken issue with the House report. The incident in Falluja ""was a tragedy in which no one -- but the terrorists -- are to blame,"" the company said in a recent statement. Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said Donna Zovko is ""a grieving mother, understandably so, and our thoughts remain with her and her entire family.""  Watch Donna Zovko's quest » . Today, Blackwater's Prince added this: ""I was communicating with her all the way up until the time the lawsuit was filed."" The Zovko family disputes that claim. The company, which provides security across the globe, has come under intense scrutiny since its employees were accused of killing 17 Iraqi civilians and wounding 27 others on September 16 of this year in a hail of gunfire in Baghdad. Donna Zovko and the three other families who lost their relatives in the Falluja ambush have sued Blackwater, alleging the company failed to provide their loved ones with adequate gear, weaponry and support. Blackwater has denied the allegations and argued the men agreed to assume the risks of working in a war zone. As for those who murdered her son, Donna Zovko said: ""It's not mine to judge and I don't want to judge them. But it would be nice to know what happened to those people that celebrated the deaths of my son, Mike, Wes and Scotty. It would be nice to know if they had to answer to anyone besides God."" One day, she hopes to visit that site on Highway 10 in Falluja where the killings occurred to build a monument to those who died. ""They can knock it down and I'll just build it back up,"" she said. This mother -- who arrived in the United States when she was 15, three years to the day before her son was born -- then walked over to Jerry's grave and said the Lord's Prayer. ""I'll see you Sunday,"" she said, rubbing the headstone. She met Pope John Paul II in August 2004 after her son was killed and he told her ""God has accepted Jerry's soul"" -- comforting words that still give her peace.  Watch why she would ""give back"" pope meeting » . ""It was a big gift for me to see the Holy Father and to meet the Holy Father, but for the truth of my Jerry's death, I'd give it back,"" she said, choking back tears. ""I'd say, 'No, I want Blackwater to tell me everything.'"" Later that day, the tight-knit family gathered at a Croatian community center for dinner. Afterward, Jerry Zovko's brother, Tommy, watched his mom and dad walk through the darkness to their car as rain poured down. ""We try to live a normal life,"" he said. ""But it's anything but normal."" E-mail to a friend .","Mom says she'd trade meeting the pope to meet with Blackwater's chairman .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo has escaped punishment over the car smash earlier this year that saw his Ferrari written off. Ronaldo's Ferrari was a complete write-off after his accident on the way to training. The Manchester United star, who is set to move to Real Madrid for a world record fee, demolished the front of his high-performance sports car after he hit a roadside barrier in a tunnel on a freeway in the north-west of England city. No other vehicle was involved and Ronaldo escaped injury. He spoke to police officers at the scene and was also later interviewed as well as giving a written statement. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman told Press Association Tuesday. ""No further action will be taken against the driver of a Ferrari 599 GTB, which collided with a wall on the A538 Wilmslow Road on Thursday, January 8. ""No-one was injured and no other vehicles were involved in the incident."" It was reported that the Portuguese star had only owned the top-of-the-range sports car for just a few days before the accident. The impact of the crash saw one of the Ferrari's wheels come off and end up 200 meters away, with skid marks on the road clearly prominent. The FIFA World Player of the Year walked away from the smash and was given a lift to training that morning by then Manchester United teammate Edwin van der Sar who had been driving along the same stretch of road behind him. Dutchman Van de Sar also provided a statement to police about the incident. Real Madrid and Manchester United confirmed last week that they had reached a deal to send Ronaldo to the Bernabeu, but it has still to be officially sealed.","Manchester police will not take action over Cristiano Ronaldo car crash .

"(CNN) -- The international governing body for athletics urged caution Friday after reports that the world-champion South African runner Caster Semenya has both male and female organs. The front cover of You magazine shows Semenya after a recent makeover. The Sydney Morning Herald in Australia and The Sun newspaper in Britain reported that gender tests ordered by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) show the 18-year-old is a hermaphrodite. Neither paper named the source of their information. IAAF spokesman Nick Davies would not discuss the findings with CNN. ""I simply haven't seen the results,"" Davies said. ""We have received the results from Germany, but they now need to be examined by a group of experts and we will not be in a position to speak to the athlete about them for at least a few weeks. ""After that, depending on the results, we will meet privately with the athlete to discuss further action."" Has Semenya been treated fairly? The IAAF issued a statement, saying no decision on the case will be announced until the experts can look at the results. A final decision regarding the case is not expected before the IAAF Council meets in late November in Monaco, the IAAF said. Davies also said the news reports should be treated with caution. The newspapers said extensive physical examinations of Semenya show she has no ovaries, but rather has internal testes, which are producing large amounts of testosterone. What is intersexuality? Semenya won the women's 800-meters gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin last month. She crushed her rivals by streaking away to secure victory in 1 minute, 55.45 seconds -- the best women's time in the world this year. Defending champion Janeth Jepkosgei of Kenya took the silver and Jennifer Meadows of Britain claimed bronze. The IAAF said it was seeking tests on Semenya's gender even before that race. Davies said questions about her were first raised after her astonishing displays at the African junior championships in July, with her masculine build and surprising performance fueling the rumors. South Africans reacted angrily to Friday's reports, with one newspaper headline declaring ""outrage."" Sport and Recreation Minister Makhenkesi Stofile said he was ""shocked and disgusted"" at the treatment that Semenya has received from the media, the IAAF, and the world. ""She may be a hermaphrodite, but so what? She is still a girl,"" Stofile told a news conference in Pretoria. Even if Semenya has an unfortunate ""proportion of hormones,"" he said, she is still ""a young girl enjoying growing up."" Stofile said he believes the teenager's human rights have been violated and that she was not given a chance to understand what the gender testing was all about. South Africa will fight back if Semenya is excluded from further competition, Stofile said, adding, ""It will be a third world war."" All indications were Friday that, at the very least, Semenya may be able to keep the gold medal she won in Berlin. ""Our legal advice is that, if she proves to have an advantage because of the male hormones, then it will be extremely difficult to strip the medal off her, since she has not cheated,"" Davies told CNN. Semenya's countrymen -- including her father and the South Africa team manager -- have maintained that Semenya is a female. Thousands of supporters crammed the airport in Johannesburg when she returned from Berlin last month. And this week, the athlete appeared on the cover of a South African magazine wearing makeup, jewelry and a glamorous dress. Under IAAF rules, any time there is suspicion about an athlete's gender, the athlete can be asked to attend a medical evaluation before a panel consisting of a gynecologist, an endocrinologist, a psychologist, an internal medicine specialist and an expert on gender issues. There are chromosome tests and scans of the athlete's body, Davies has said. He called gender verification -- which is generally required only for female athletes -- ""an extremely complex procedure."" The process of gender verification has undergone big changes since it was first introduced for international competition in the 1960s, the IAAF said. The first mechanism involved ""rather crude and perhaps humiliating physical examinations,"" which soon gave way to mouth swabs to collect chromosomes, the IAAF said. There were too many uncertainties regarding the mouth swabs, so the IAAF abandoned them in 1991 and the International Olympic Committee discontinued them in 2000, the IAAF said. A proper test has yet to be found, the IAAF said, and the current round of tests is considered a good interim solution.","South African Sports Minister ""shocked and disgusted"" at Semenya treatment .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Co-workers are always a great topic of conversation. You never run out of things to say when it comes to talking about the different types of people you work with, what you love, what you hate and how you deal with it all. We thought we'd do a little research into some of the best co-workers out there. Not just the different personality types, but real people, who do real good things. What we found found is that many workers out there are generous, kind people who put their colleagues' lives before their own without hesitation. Here are 5 of the most heroic co-workers people encountered this year. The heroes . 1. Co-worker helps to save a fellow employee's life . Claude Marlowe, a diabetic, went to work one morning like any other day. When he went to shake a colleague's hand, he had a heart attack and dropped dead -- literally. That's when Debi Coffman and another co-worker, Larry Garrett, realized that this wasn't a diabetic episode; Marlowe had no pulse. The two performed CPR and chest compressions and revived Marlowe three times before emergency crews arrived. He suffered five heart attacks and was brain dead for at least two hours. He would not be alive had his co-workers not known what to do. (Nascar.com) 2. Chandler worker helps colleague get new artificial leg . For 30 years, Gregory Lewis, a retail maintenance worker, walked with the same prosthetic device on his left leg. As the years wore on, so did his artificial leg. One day, he lifted his foot off the ground to get into his car, and the artificial leg fell off. Lewis had no health insurance and didn't have money for a new prosthesis, which cost more than $10,000. Daniel Anderson, a code enforcement officer who moonlights as a Dillard's security guard, knew about his co-worker's struggle, and was determined to help. Thanks to friends and family, Anderson raised $1,000 and earned the rest of the money with the help of Dillard's and a local prosthetic company to buy Lewis a new leg. (The Arizona Republic) 3. Houston transit worker helps fallen woman on Metro tracks . When Eliot Swainson, a Houston Transit Authority employee, was volunteering for the Metro in Washington, D.C., he didn't expect to come home a hero. But that's just what Swainson became when he directed a woman who had fallen on the tracks to safety. Swainson was giving directions to other passengers when Metro patrons began yelling that someone had fallen on the tracks. He and another person unsuccessfully tried to remove the woman from the tracks. Swainson was left with one option: direct the woman to safety while the train passed overhead. He told the woman to stay as close to the edge of the track as possible, under the overhang next to the tracks to avoid getting hit. After the train passed, they cut power to the tracks and got the woman to safety. (dcist.com/) 4. Hair stylist saves coworker . Carol Morgan, a 68-year-old hair stylist, helped resuscitate co-worker who suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Sue Flood, 64, had just finished eating lunch and was washing her dishes in the sink when she collapsed. As another colleague screamed for help, Morgan ran to Flood, who had no pulse. She immediately began chest compressions and CPR. When emergency crews arrived, Flood had just started to breathe and have some movement. Morgan says that she has known CPR for 15 to 20 years but never had to use it until that day. (Pryor Daily Times) 5. Hero died saving co-worker . Earl Ramersad was a supervisor at Delta Glass, a Canadian company, for more than 10 years. He died a hero when he pushed a co-worker out of harm's way by absorbing the full impact of glass panes that fell while workers were off-loading it from a container. Colleagues said Ramersad went to help his crew when the accident happened and ended up saving someone's life instead. (Trinidad & Tobago Express) &copy CareerBuilder.com 2010. All rights reserved.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva rejected protesters' demands Monday that he call an early election and dissolve parliament, saying on national television that he would listen to the protesters but would not be forced to accede to their demands. The rejection came after another largely peaceful day of demonstration during which thousands of red-shirted protesters called for a blood bath of sorts -- organizing a blood drive and threatening to spatter hundreds of liters of donated blood over government buildings and the prime minister's residence. Abhisit spent much of Monday morning holed up in a safe house in a military compound, which was surrounded by protesters. He left by helicopter in order to survey the situation, after which the protesters left the site. The protests, which were expected to continue Tuesday, have hurt the economy. The nation's tourism minister estimated the demonstrations might have resulted in a 20 percent drop in tourists. The impact on Chinese visitors appears to have been greater, with the Chinese Chamber of Commerce reporting a 50 percent cancellation rate. ""Red shirts"" rally in Bangkok: Share your photos . The protesters, who are trying to bring down the prime minister's administration, announced the blood drive an hour after Abhisit ignored a demand by the ""red shirts"" -- named for their clothing -- to dissolve parliament by noon Monday. Nattawut Saikua -- one of the leaders of the anti-government United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship -- said the protesters will collect 1,000 liters (1 million cubic centimeters) of blood Tuesday and then throw it on the grounds of the Government House, which houses ministerial offices. If Abhisit still refuses to dissolve parliament, the demonstrators said, they will collect another 1,000 liters of blood the next day and splash it on the headquarters of the ruling party. The next day, they will collect 1,000 more liters and target the prime minister's residence, the demonstrators said. The anti-government demonstrations began Friday. By Sunday, tens of thousands of protesters had poured into the center of Bangkok. The rallies have been largely peaceful. Abhisit said Monday that his government will not use force to quell the demonstrations. Army Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd said a number of grenades were tossed from a side street into the 11th Infantry headquarters, where the Center for the Administration of Peace and Order is coordinating the government response to the protests. Two soldiers were hurt, the colonel said. The protesters are supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. Thaksin was the only Thai prime minister to serve a full term and remains hugely popular. He fled the country in 2008 while facing trial on corruption charges that he says were politically motivated. The protesters say Abhisit was not democratically elected and have demanded that he call new elections. About 50,000 security forces were mobilized ahead of the protests and additional soldiers were guarding Abhisit. Since Thaksin's ouster, Thailand has endured widespread political unrest that has pitted Thaksin loyalists against Abhisit supporters. Two people were killed and at least 135 wounded in riots in April 2009 when protesters clashed with demonstrators supporting the government. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report .","PM Abhisit Vejjajiva says he will listen to protesters but not accede to their demands .

"(CNN) -- Detroit police have arrested a man suspected to be the rapist who ""terrorized"" women on the city's Northeast side, the police chief said Monday. Raynard Coleman, 31, was taken into custody without incident last Wednesday, after DNA evidence tied him to six of seven assaults that have taken place in the city since January 1, Chief Ralph Godbee said. Police believe the suspect targeted the females, ages 17 to 33, as they waited at or were walking near bus stops. The victims were taken to nearby vacant buildings and assaulted, according to the chief. Detroit police set up a 24-hour operational command post, which was manned by a specialized joint task force, to receive tips about the attacks, Godbee said. Tips also came in on Facebook, he said. The police chief credited teamwork from people in the community and the combined efforts of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies for helping in the search for the rapist. ""Every person in this department, community, outside of the community, they were extremely engaged in this process,"" the chief said. ""There is no person in the Detroit metro area that this didn't touch."" Godbee also recognized the victims for coming forth to report the crimes. Without their descriptions, he said, police would not have been able to release a composite sketch to the public. The charges against Coleman, who has no history of sexual crimes, include kidnapping, aggravated assault, criminal sexual conduct, armed robbery and felony with a firearm, according to Jerry Dorsey IV, with the Wayne County prosecutor's office. If convicted, Coleman could be sentenced to life in prison, Dorsey said.","Raynard Coleman, 31, is accused in six assaults in Detroit, the police chief says .

"(CNN) -- In most places, when 16 people are gunned down, the local media reports the incident without missing a beat. But when the massacre described above happened last weekend in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, the editors of the city's largest daily newspaper had to have a long discussion before deciding to cover and investigate the story. As drug cartel violence continues unabated throughout Mexico, journalists find themselves walking a thin line between covering the story and becoming part of it. Already this year, three journalists have been killed in Mexico, reaffirming the country's place as one of the most dangerous in the world for journalists. The drug violence ""generates fear, even if you don't like to admit it,"" Pedro Torres, deputy editor of El Diario de Juarez told CNN. Drug cartels have targeted reporters and editors who report on their activities, something that gives editors pause before reporting on incidents likely linked to the cartels. After discussion, the Juarez newspaper decided to investigate the gruesome slayings that happened over the weekend, but are aware of what that means. ""We are always trying to investigate, but when you get too deep you draw a reaction,"" Torres said, referring to threats from drug traffickers. ""In this case, we are trying to dig as deep as possible."" However, if the paper's efforts are met with ""reactions,"" they will have to back down, he said. It is a form of self-censorship that many media outlets in Mexico have accepted out of concern for the safety of their staffs. Sometimes, cartel members will call the newspaper to try to get reporters to not write about certain incidents; other times they push for certain stories to be included. ""There's pressure from all sides,"" Torres said. In January, a crime reporter for the Zocalo newspaper in Saltillo, Mexico -- Valentin Valdes Espinosa -- was kidnapped. He was found dead shortly after, his body showing signs of torture and with several bullet wounds.. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Valdes Espinosa was found with a message that read: ""This is going to happen to those who don't understand. The message is for everyone."" Less than two weeks later, authorities in the state of Sinaloa found the body of another journalist who was kidnapped in December. Jose Luis Romero's body also showed signs of torture, CPJ reported. The most recent victim was Jorge Ochoa Martinez, a Mexican editor and publisher of two papers in the western state of Guerrero who died last week after being shot in the face, according to local media. The state attorney general's office told CNN Wednesday that there were two leads in the investigation, but that authorities were not ready to talk about them publicly yet. ""Obviously, for this year, it's already an alarming figure,"" Anthony Mills, press freedom manager for the International Press Institute in Vienna, Austria, told CNN. ""There appears to be no end in sight."" ""Although journalists continue bravely to do their jobs, the fact of the matter is that the systematic killing of journalists is going to have an effect on the job that journalists do,"" Mills added. Compounding the problem, Mills said, is either the inability or unwillingness of Mexican authorities to investigate violence against journalists. The Juarez paper had a reporter killed in 2008. Federal and local authorities visited the newspaper office and vowed to bring the killers to justice, ""but in the end, nothing happens,"" Torres said. The case of the Juarez reporter, Armando Rodriguez, remains unsolved. Agustin Lozano, editor-in-chief of El Bravo newspaper in Matamoros, Mexico, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, said excessive caution has become the norm for reporting crime. ""I don't want heroes here at my newspaper because it could be dangerous,"" Lozano told CNN. ""We are reporters, we are not police."" Matamoros has not seen as much violence as other border cities, but it is the home of the Gulf cartel. Out of an abundance of caution, Lozano's newspaper reports only on incidents that the police department gives news conferences or press releases about. Lozano said journalists are just the messengers who are getting caught in the middle of a conflict that is international in scope. Mexico, as a transport country for drugs, and the United States, as a consumer of drugs, have to work together to resolve the trafficking problem before journalists and others can be safe, he said. In the meantime, ""there is no security, no guarantees."" Despite the challenges and dangerous environment, Torres, the editor in Juarez, remains hopeful. ""Our goal is to return to doing the type of journalism we were doing two years ago,"" before the violence there escalated, he said.","Three Mexican journalists have been killed so far in 2010 .
