But unless you’re very, very brave, the chances of smiling when you come off it seem remote. Alton Towers’s latest rollercoaster cost £18million and has entered the Guinness Book of Records for being the ride with the most loops – 14. The Smiler, which opens this month,  has drops of 98ft, reaches speeds of up to 52mph and was designed with the help of psychologists and scientists for maximum thrills. A spokesman for the Staffordshire theme park said: ‘We want people to get off the ride and not know what is real.’ Scroll down for video . Dizzying: The Smiler is the world's first 14-loop rollercoaster - setting a new Guinness World Record for the most inversions. The new ride at Alton Towers in Staffordshire sends thrillseekers off at top speeds of 53mph and well as plunging them by up to 98ft . Alton Tower's £18million record-breaking ride, which includes plunging 30 metre drops, is the biggest in the theme park's history . It beat the 10-loop Colossus in Thorpe Park, Surrey, and another 10-loop ride in China to become the rollercoaster with the most loops. Katherine Duckworth, one of the team who came up with the concept for the ride, said: 'This ride will put not just your body but also your mind through its paces. 'There are five different mind effects, which are all designed to mess with your head. You shoot towards giant syringes, spinning hypnotic wheels, and flashing lights, among other things.' The ride blasts towards huge needles and what looks like a drive-through car wash but, of course, the threat they present is only in the mind. The Smiler is twice the size of Nemesis and lasts two minutes and 45 seconds . Fear factory: The ride also uses psychological techniques to disorient thrill-seekers . 'There is more track per square metre than any other ride in the world,' adds Katherine. 'It is twice the size of Nemesis and each ride lasts two minutes and 45 seconds. This is a very big roller coaster ride. When you get off, you wont know what is real.' Researchers from New Scientist magazine were involved in Smiler's design. They found anticipation is a key factor in ensuring a thrill and that they worked best when presented as stories or narratives. New Scientist editor Jeremy Webb said: 'All the experiences we use to generate thrill involve an element of fear.

'The emotion is triggered by either something physical, such as pain, or a mental one - most commonly the anticipation of danger. 'Thrill is a combination of fear and the euphoria we experience after everything has ended. 'It is like a good play or horror movie when the excitement builds and your heart starts pumping and then everything is OK at the end. John Wardley, a ride consultant at Alton Towers, said: 'The Smiler is set to be one of the most thrilling rides in the world. 'To heighten the feeling of excitement we needed a ride with a variety of mental cues. 'The Smiler will be different from other traditional rollercoasters in that it will combine intense physical effects along with unique mental elements.'

The majestic moons and rings of Saturn are thought to hold the key to understanding the origins of the universe. And now Nasa has been able to capture the planet’s dazzling rings in unprecedented detail, along with its 'Death Star' moon seen glowing in the distance. The space agency’s Cassini probe took this image on October 22, 2013, when it was about 1.6 million miles (2.6 million km) from Saturn. Among the interplay of Saturn's shadow and rings, Mimas, which appears in the lower-right corner of the image, orbits Saturn as a set of the ever-intriguing spokes appear in the B ring (just to the right of centre) The planet’s moon Mimas, also known as the ‘Death Star’ because of its resemblance to the space station, is visible as a pin prick of light at the bottom right. The image also shows the mysterious ‘spokes’ in Saturn's B ring, just to the right of centre. What creates these spokes is still a mystery, but scientists do know that the spokes no longer appear when the sun is higher in Saturn's sky. ‘It is believed that this has to do with the ability of micron-sized ring grains to maintain an electrical charge and levitate above the rings, forming spokes,’ Nasa said. Saturn's moon Mimas, also known as the ‘Death Star’ can be seen as a pin prick of light (circled in red) in the right image. The left image highlights the 'mysterious 'spokes' on the planet's rings .

The mysterious object, which was located at the right edge of Saturn's A ring, has been named 'Peggy' after Professor Murray's mother-in-law . Launched in 1997, Cassini has been exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004. On . Saturn, a full year is the equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning . Cassini has only been able to observe a third of a Saturn year. Since 2004, Saturn and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer. Cassini . has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving . there in 2004, also observing Jupiter, the heliosphere, and testing the . theory of relativity. Cassini is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter orbit. Mimas is an inner moon of Saturn and averages 246 miles (396 km) in diameter.  Mimas and another Saturn moon, Rhea, have been called ‘the most heavily cratered body in the solar system.’ Based on data gathered from the Cassini spacecraft, scientists last year estimated that Saturn’s rings date back more than four billion years. Its images have provided some surprises for scientists in the past few years. For instance in a talk at American Geophysical Union in December, Professor Carl Murray of Queen Mary University of London said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft. The mysterious object, which was located at the right edge of Saturn’s A ring, has been named ‘Peggy’ after Professor Murray’s mother-in-law. Peggy is thought to be about a 0.6 miles (1km) in diameter, which experts claim is too small for it to be a moon. It could, however, be the build-up of ring material that has collapsed gravitationally under its own weight. Some of Saturn’s moons, particularly those orbiting near the rings, are thought to have formed in this way, creating a ring of dust then collecting more material to grow. The planet is known to have of 53 natural rings with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings. Some moons, such as Prometheus and Pandora, interact with ring material, shepherding the ring in its orbit. Scientists have used this image to analyse mysterious propeller shapes which frequently appear within the rings. Based on data gathered from the Cassini spacecraft, scientists last year estimated that Saturn¿s rings date back more than four billion years . This image was released by Nasa in 2012.

An 81-year-old great-grandmother from Maryland has been placed behind bars for a minor pet violation committed almost a year ago. Last May, a neighbor snapped pictures of Mary Magdalene Root's small dogs running down the street and she was reported to Animal Control. It landed her with a $7,000 fine or up to a year in jail. Arrested: An 81-year-old great-grandmother, Mary Magdalene Root, was placed behind bars for a minor pet violation committed nearly a year ago. The Maryland woman says she tried paying thousands of dollars in fines but couldn¿t afford them . Mary Magdalene Root, 81, who lives near Havre de Grace, was jailed on $2,500 bail on seven counts of allegedly letting her dogs run at-large a year ago . The dogs ran out of her home last year and she gave chase but it was to no avail . The Harford County woman says she tried paying thousands of dollars in fines but couldn’t afford them. 'I’ve never had a crime. Never. Not even a traffic ticket,' Ms Root told CBS Baltimore. 'I’m struggling to pay my house taxes. I couldn’t pay it. It’s a different thing when you leave your dogs out and you don’t care. But I do care,' Root said. She failed to show up at court to argue her case under doctors orders. Root is charged with failing to pay seven $75 civil citations for three incidents on Feb. 13, 2013, March 1, 2013 and March 10, 2013 in which her dogs ¿ a tan terrier mix and a black and tan Chihuahua ¿ were loose near her home, according to charging documents . Root has lived in Maryland her entire life and at her current residence on Oak Drive for 40 years. She also has no prior convitions . According to court records, the county issued a warrant for Root's arrest on February 12th after she failed to appear for a court hearing last November to address the civil citations. Upon finding out about that she was a wanted woman, . she was admitted to Harford Memorial Hospital on Valentine's Day. It was then a judge had her arrested. She was booked, fingerprinted and made to wear a jumpsuit like any other prisoner.

After paying the bond she was ordered barred from keeping animals on her property. Root says she was taking care of her daughter’s four dogs at the time of her arrest. The dogs, a tan terrier mix and a black and tan Chihu, were on the loose near her home. 'I feel like I’m a criminal, but yet I don’t feel like I’ve done anything,' Root said . Incredibly, a stranger and Good Samaritan ended up paying her bond. Mary Magdalene Root¿s small dogs are her constant companions. So much so that the 81-year-old widow spent two nights in the Harford County Detention Center fighting to keep them . Root¿s defense attorneys asked the judge to let the senior citizen go. She had no previous criminal history and she was in failing health. The judge said no . 'There are very nice people out there. But then there are some people who are so struck on the strictness of the law. I don’t know whether maybe that needs to be looked at,' Root said. She has been told that she is unable to return to her home of 44 years and live with the dogs, but she says she can't simply get rid of them. She is now living with her daughter, but the dogs have been taken away, and Ms. Root is now a broken woman. 'I love them,' she said. 'I was planning on coming down on the dogs. But my dogs, they keep my company and I love them.' The judge ordered her to pay a $2,500 bail. And if she was able to pay it and get out, then no animals would be allowed back on her property . the 81-year-old cancer survivor receive the convictions more than a year ago but never bothered to pay the fines . Her daughter told the Baltimore Sun that her mother is just an animal lover who has owned several animals including dogs, an iguana and snakes over the years. 'She's very passionate about her animals,' Vantina Gifford, 52, said following the hearing. 'They do get out, but they don't hurt anybody. They have never attacked, never bitten, tore up property or defecated on anyone's property.' Ms Root says she has received a lot of support from the community and there is now a petition asking lawmakers to show leniency when they involve senior citizens. “I don’t know if I’ll ever be the same. I can’t pull myself back,' Root said. According to Root's daughter, her mother is just an animal lover. She said her mom has owned several animals including dogs, an iguana and snakes over the years . Ms. Root says that without her dogs she does know now what she is going to do.

Storm: David Silvester caused outrage by saying gay marriage had caused an Old Testament style flood . A local politician who claimed Britain was flooded because the nation legalised gay marriage is being investigated over claims he broke his council's code of conduct. David Silvester, 73, was thrown out of the UK Independence Party and had his house egged after he made the claim in a letter to his local newspaper in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. Protesters attached a rainbow banner to his home and more than 25,000 people signed an online petition calling for him to resign. Now it has emerged officials are investigating him after 12 people lodged formal complaints of councillor misconduct. They claimed the Henley-on-Thames town councillor broke a 19-point code of conduct, which includes a clause that says councillors must treat other people with respect. The investigation has been elevated to South Oxfordshire District Council - but if officials do decide he broke the code, the strongest punishment they can issue is a reprimand. Councillor misconduct is an internal issue, not a criminal one, and they have no powers to suspend Cllr Silvester or remove him from office. A spokesman for South Oxfordshire District Council said the investigation would take a minimum of a month and begin by the end of March. 'The investigator will judge the case against the precedents to consider whether the code of conduct applies in this case,' he added. 'If the code is deemed to have applied, the investigation will judge whether the councillor breached it.' In the aftermath of the row in January, Henley-on-Thames council clerk Mike Kennedy issued a strongly-worded statement denying the council's involvement. 'The use of the council's name] has caused many residents of Henley and indeed further afield to conclude that the personal opinions expressed by Councillor Silvester in his letter are somehow associated with the views of Henley-on-Thames Town Council,' he said. 'This is not the case and the Town Council strongly refutes any suggestion to the contrary.' Unrepentant: The 73-year-old would not apologise for his views and received 12 formal complaints . Ukip leader Nigel Farage was forced to intervene - expelling Cllr Silvester but defending his right to hold what he called 'barmy' views - after the party initially refused to take action. The row was sparked after the 73-year-old wrote: 'The scriptures make it abundantly clear that a Christian nation that abandons its faith and acts contrary to the Gospel (and in naked breach of a coronation oath) will be beset by natural disasters such as storms, disease, pestilence and war. Anger: The letter appeared in the Henley Standard . 'I wrote to David Cameron in April 2012 to warn him that disasters would accompany the passage of his same-sex marriage bill. 'But he went ahead despite a 600,000-signature petition by concerned Christians and more than half of his own parliamentary party saying that he should not do so. 'It is his fault that large swathes of the nation have been afflicted by storms and floods. 'He has arrogantly acted against the Gospel that once made Britain ""great"" and the lesson surely to be learned is that no man or men, however powerful, can mess with Almighty God with impunity and get away with it for everything a nation does is weighed on the scaled of divine approval or disapproval.' Speaking to MailOnline in January Cllr Silvester said he had quit the Tories over gay marriage. He said: 'The Conservatives are known as the party of the Queen. The Queen in her coronation oath promised to only to pass those laws that are consistent with the Christian gospel. 'There is a command to love all men, and I hope I love all men, but we are also taught to love the person but hate the sin.' When told hundreds of people thought he was crazy, he said: 'That may be so if you are not a person of prayer. I am a person of prayer. I pray for each member of the Cabinet every day and each member of the Royal family every day.' Cllr Silvester remains on the town council as an independent member. At a extraordinary meeting last month, he refused to apologise for his comments but did say he was was sorry for upsetting the gay community.","David Silvester, 73, sparked row by writing a letter to the Henley Standard .

A one-day-old Paul Fronczak was abducted from his mother’s arms at Michael Reese Hospital in April 1964 by a woman posing as a nurse. The . FBI interviewed hundreds of suspects and examined 10,000 babies in . their hunt for the infant. Did she do it? New clues in the 1964 abduction of infant Paul Fronczak (right) suggest that Linda Taylor, America's reviled 'welfare queen' (left), may have been the kidnapper who snatched the child from his mother . Dora Fronczak breaks down during a 1964 press conference with her husband, Chester Fronczak, as they talk about their missing baby, at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago . A year later, a boy found abandoned in a stroller on a street corner in . Newark, New Jersey, was returned to Chester and Dora Fronczak, who were . told by the FBI that it was their kidnapped son. The . agents didn't have much to go on at the time - there was only one . photograph of the one-day-old Paul before he was kidnapped and . DNA comparison was not yet available. However, . the federal agents drew their conclusion from the fact the New Jersey . boy's ears looked the same as the snatched Fronczak baby. It . was good enough for Chester and Dora. According to news . reports from the time, Dora Fronczak took one look at the child and . said: 'That's my baby.' But 50 years later, DNA tests found that the child the Fronczak couple had raised as their own was not their biological son. The story of the infamous kidnapping case, and the subsequent revelations made possible by modern technology, has been widely covered in the media. Last November, ABC's '20/20' aired a special report focusing on the search for 49-year-old Paul Fronczaks' birth parents - and on the quest to find the family's biological son who vanished without a trace half a century ago. The episode revived the public’s interest in the cold case, with hundreds of people from around the world calling ABC with tips - among them Johnnie Harbaugh. The 64-year-old Chicago resident said that he is the son of Linda Taylor, who gained the status of a public enemy after President Reagan mentioned in a speech that she had been accused of committing countless crimes using 100 aliases and 50 fake addresses. Discovered: This is a picture of Paul Fronczak being held by a New Jersey nurse after he was found abandoned on the street and made a ward of the state . Dora and Chester Fronczak leave Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago days after their baby Paul was abducted in 1964 . ‘My mother was capable of anything. Not only stealing a baby, but she could steal you,’ Harbaugh said in an interview to be aired Saturday on ABC News ‘20/20’. ‘She was just that kind of woman. You know, she done whatever it took for her to survive.’ After being shown a photo of the one-day-old Paul Fronczak, Harbaugh claimed that he saw the baby for the first time when his mother brought him to their house one day in 1964. Harbaugh recalled that he used to play with the infant, who got the nickname 'Tiger.’ Taylor, who died 12 years ago from a heart attack, was known as a master of disguise. Born Martha Miller or Martha Louise White, the brunette woman with a slightly dark complexion could pass off as Caucasian, Jewish, African-American, Asian or Puerto Rican. Although Reagan used Taylor's example to illustrate the abuses of the welfare system in the United State, it is generally believed that the scope of her criminal activity was much broader, encompasing assault, theft, bigamy, and possibly even murder. According to her son, the woman often described as a 'chameleon' had a room in their home dedicated entirely to her wigs and disguises, including nurse and doctor outfits. Son's confession: Linda Taylor's son Johnnie Harbaugh, 64, said that one day in 1964, his mother showed up at the house with an infant that looked exactly like Paul Fronczak in his first photographer taken when he was one day old . Mistress of disguise: Harbaugh said that his 'welfare queen' mother, pictured here around the time of her welfare fraud trial in 1977, had an entire room dedicated to her wigs and nurse outfits . In 1977, Taylor’s schemes and lies had . finally caught up with her when she was found guilty of multiple counts . of welfare fraud and sentenced to two to six years for claiming public . assistance, Social Security and veteran's benefits  by using fake identities. It was during the trial that she first became a suspect in the abduction of Paul Fronczak. According . to a newspaper report, one of Taylor's ex-husbands said that she showed up one day in the early 60s with a newborn baby boy. Taylor never admitted to the kidnapping and never faced charges in connection to the Fronczak case. Speaking . to ABC, Taylor's son said that he came home from school one day and . found that the infant dubbed 'Tiger' was gone. His mother offered him no . explanation regarding his whereabouts. Looking back on the ordeal, Harbaugh said his mother most likely handed baby Paul to one of her boyfriends from Tennessee. It . remains unknown what happened to the man or the child. The FBI told . ABC's ‘20/20’ that they are looking into Taylor's possible involvement . in the kidnapping. The Paul Fronczak . found in New Jersey has said that his adoptive parents support his quest . to discover his identity and find out what happened to their biological . child. Ripped from the headlines: The 1964 kidnapping from Paul Fronczak, who was taken from his mother's arms one day after he was born, made international news . As their own: Dora Fronczak reportedly said 'That's my baby' when she saw Paul. Nearly five decades later, it was revealed that Paul belongs to a different family . 'I think that the perfect ending would be to find the real Paul, see that he's doing well and then on the same day find my real family. It would also be nice to have an actual birth date that I could believe in, he told the Chicago Tribune. Chameleon: Born Martha Miller or Martha Louise White, the brunette woman with a somewhat dark complexion could pass off as Caucasian, Jewish, black, Asian or Puerto Rican . The amazing story was the subject of a '20/20' prime-time special with Barbara Walters on ABC last fall. In the wake of the screening, four men put themselves forward as . possible candidates for being Paul. One, from Kansa, has offered to participate in a DNA test. Paul Fronczak told ABC News: 'I would want nothing more than to . have them be able to meet or at least know what happened to their real . child before they're gone.' The news of the mismatched DNA has turned the Fronczak . family upside down long after the kidnapped was supposedly solved. It . has also raised a host of chilling, new questions. Paul says he has caught himself wondering how old he actually is, why his birth parents abandoned him, what is birth name was. Chester . and Dora never told Paul about his turbulent history. He only learned . about the kidnapping when he found a box of newspaper clippings when he . got older. When he confronted his parents they told him, 'You don’t need to see that. You are our son.’ Years . later, Paul moved from Chicago to Henderson, Nevada, outside Las Vegas. He started a family of his own with wife Michelle and daughter Emma. Life-changing: Paul Fronczak learned from a DNA test that he is not the baby snatched from parents' arms - even though they raised him thinking he was their own son since he was found in New Jersey in 1965 . But questions had nagged at him ever since he found the box of newspaper articles. He didn't look Polish and Croatian like his parents. Police at the time had also expressed doubts about whether the boy from Newark was really Paul Fronczak. They made Chester and Dora go through the adoption process because there was no proof the child was really theirs. One night, when his parents were visiting from Chicago, Paul bought a drug store DNA kit. He told KLAS last month: 'I said, ""Hey, have you guys ever wondered if I was yours?"" You know, making a joke out of it. I said, ""Hold on,"" I went and got the DNA kit, broke it out, and five minutes later, we were swabbing away.'","Linda Taylor, who died in 2002, was sentenced in 1977 for large-scale welfare fraud .

A former trainee teacher who turned his flat into a prison for children and tried to snatch two little girls has been jailed. George Richards, 29, blacked out all his windows and placed bolts high on the doors so youngsters would not be able to escape. He then tried to abduct a 10-year-old girl on a footbridge on September 12 last year but fled after being shouted at by an off-duty police officer. The following Monday, he went to a cul-de-sac and grabbed a five year old girl from her doorstep before running off when her mother intervened. Officers found him nearby and when they approached he held a fake gun at them, but was eventually arrested. Richards, who is from Ware, Hertfordshire, was found with a kitchen knife, tape and two lengths of string on him. Officers also found a newspaper clipping of murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler at his flat. Richards pleaded guilty to two counts of child abduction, using an imitation firearm and possessing a knife on January 23. He was sentenced to life and given a minimum term of seven years in jail at St Albans Crown Court on Friday. Passing sentence, Judge John Plumstead said: 'The level of danger you represent to the public is enormous. 'I am perfectly sure you were intent on abducting and sexually assaulting, or worse, helpless children, but you lost your nerve.' Richards was jailed for three years at the Old Bailey under the name Luke Sadowski in 2003. He had arranged to buy a child from Eastern Europe for £250 from FBI officers in a sting operation at a London hotel. Richards was sentenced to life and given a minimum term of seven years in jail at St Albans Crown Court . A search of his university room that year found a safe full of handcuffs, leg shackles and a gun, amongst other paraphernalia. Dante Leccacorvi, defending, said Richards was trying to 'goad' police, saying he was concerned he was being followed by authorities.

The 26-year-old singer has clearly enjoyed her foray into the fashion world revealing that she has hopes of designing her own range one day. Speaking to MailOnline, the Maybelline Better Skin foundation ambassador said: 'I love doing the modelling I’m really . enjoying it and learning lots from working with different photographers. Dressed to impress: Mollie King showcased her . incredible figure in form-fitting double denim as she posed up a storm . in a positively flawless shoot for Maybelline cosmetics . 'However my priorities for this year are with the band and with Oasis as . I have another collection coming out with them in April.' Mollie's . 'Loved By Mollie' AW13 collection for Oasis - a 45-piece capsule range . handpicked by the . well-dressed singer - went on to become one of their best-selling of all time - and fashion fans will be pleased to hear that The Saturday's star is considering turning her hand to designing. 'I would like to design, yes. Hopefully in the future. 'I've learnt . so much from doing the campaign it’s been a really nice introduction . for me because you don’t realise how much there is to learn so I’m . really pleased I’ve done it this way round first and then would like to . do into designing at some point,' she told us. Fashion fan: Mollie hand-picked an edit for Oasis and has revealed that she will be back for round two - she even has hopes of designing her own collection one day . For now, however, Mollie is focusing on her duties as ambassador for Maybelline and, naturally, she's a big fan of the brand. 'Being part of a band I worry about foundation clogging my skin and I know with Better Skin that it’s good for the appearance of my skin day-by-day and is non-clogging whilst giving a dewy finish.' Mollie maintains that her beauty regime is pretty minimal - she uses L’Oréal Paris Skin Perfection 15 Second Cleansing Oil twice a day and some Carita products on her skin. Speaking about her closeness to her fellow Saturdays band members, Mollie said: 'We love to have girly chats about make-up and hair and we love to do things like watch an award ceremony and then discuss people's make-up and hair.' Priorities: Mollie says she loved doing the modelling and has been learning lots from working with different photographers but her priorities lie with the band and her fashion duties . Despite spending a lot of time stateside and holding up fort on the front row, Mollie hasn't caught the juicing bug like her fellow celebrity friends. 'I take daily multivitamins but that’s it really,' she said of her health regime. 'I'm not a big fan of juices and I've never done a juice diet because I really like munching on my food and so don't really like the consistency of soups or smoothies. I would rather actually eat the fruit.' While most women could only dream of having Mollie's toned figure, she recently insisted she just has to work with what she's got, and she wishes that she had a more curvaceous body. Best seller: Mollie's 'Loved By Mollie' AW13 collection for Oasis - a 45-piece capsule range handpicked by the well-dressed singer - went on to become one of their best-selling of all time . She said in an interview with the March 2014 edition of Cosmopolitan magazine: 'I don’t have a Kim Kardashian bum unfortunately, and I don’t have massive boobs either. 'You have to work with the bits you’re most proud of, so if I’m going out I always think, ""Right, Molls, your legs are better than your cleavage, so go work those"". 'I’m not that curvy, so I like to wear things that give me more shape than I’ve got. Everyone has their body hang-ups; I think, ""Oh, I could tone that,"" or, ""I wish I could change that."" 'But as much as you can tone bits or add bits, you’re born with your body.' Mollie King is the ambassador for Maybelline Better Skin foundation.

Profits at the fashion chain Next are set to overtake Marks & Spencer for the first time in a  milestone for the chain and the high street. A successful Christmas means it is on course to announce a rise of at least 12 per cent for 2013, which would take the figure to around £700million. This puts it on course to make more money than M&S, which is predicted to see underlying annual pre-tax profits fall to £628million. Profits booming: The latest financial figures from Next represent a remarkable rise for the 34-year-old chain . The figures represent a remarkable . rise for a fashion chain that began only 34 years ago, compared to . M&S’s 210-year history. Marks . & Spencer has failed to win back customers, with the clothes in its . Leading Ladies ad campaign – featuring the likes of Dame Helen Mirren . and Darcey Bussell – criticised for lacking glamour, while its spring . collection was said to be unappealing to its core market. That . is in direct contrast to Next, which is lauded for giving customers . what they want, and appears prepared to embrace high-end fashion – using . top models and taking inspiration from  leading designers. The Next . Directory catalogue and online store have been central to its success . amid a remarkable rise in the number of people buying fashion on the . internet. Christmas shoppers in York city centre as a spate of early discounting from Next helped the retailer attract business . At one time, the . idea of buying clothes on the web without trying them on first seemed . ridiculous, but this is now the fastest growing of all internet sales. Some 21.2 per cent of all clothes and 26.3 per cent of shoes are now bought through online stores. Marks . & Spencer has recently re-launched its own website – a . multi-million-pound make-over including catwalk videos and mix and match . outfit suggestions – in a bid to cash in on the shift in shopping . habits. Next had a . particularly good Christmas, in contrast to M&S and the rest of the . high street. Sales were up 11.9 per cent in the eight weeks before . Christmas compared to the year before. Profits down: Customers walk near a Marks and Spencer shop in the City . The online only fashion store ASOS has taken a huge bite out of the sales of bricks and mortar chains . The . company managed to hold its shelf prices while many other big stores, . including M&S, were running promotions to get people through the . door. Sales via its directory and online division rose by 21 per cent in . the festive trading period. Analysts say Next’s sales figures were driven by areas such as knitwear and sleepwear, as well as strong growth in homeware. It . overtook M&S in terms of stock market value in 2012 and it now sits . at some £10.2billion compared to £7.5billion for M&S. Next, . which has around 500 stores, plans to expand its retail space by 4 per . cent during 2014, while also increasing its online business in the UK . and overseas. It plans to launch a site in China this year. The . shift to the web is also likely to be reflected in strong figures this . week from online fashion store ASOS, which has taken a huge bite out of . high street sales. The group . achieved sales of £335.7million in the four months to December 31. The . figure  from the UK alone rose 37 per cent, while sales overseas were up . by 38 per cent. ASOS, which . stands for As Seen on Screen, is aimed at ‘fashion forward . twenty-somethings’, and has steadily expanded around the world. It recently launched in China and is expected to hit its target of £1billion in total sales this financial year. Sharp: A jacket from Next's 2014 collection . It's no surprise that Next has finally overtaken ailing M&S. Both stores have long been trying to throw off their reputation of selling slightly dowdy workwear and frumpy casual clothes. M&S hired fashion guru Belinda Earl to revamp its collections, but went off-mark with its Leading Ladies ad campaign, which was derided for looking dowdy despite its celebrity cast. Worse, the spring collection, which was filled with crop tops and acid floral prints, was panned for being unlikely to appeal to its core market of middle-aged women. Next has been far more savvy, and listened to customers. The key message seems to have been that they were prepared to pay more for quality classics inspired by the catwalk. On the Next website you’ll find neat office dresses that are dead ringers for Roland Mouret designs and cost £35. The designs are carefully cut and conscious of what older women want: there’s plenty of sleeves, nipped-in waists, control slips and flattering cuts in classic colours. Better yet, alongside its own collections, Next has started selling brands such as Ultimo, Hobbs and Diesel. Not only does this make its own clothes seem more desirable, but gives customers an added incentive to buy from them. Next has also stuck with its Directory (every woman was on the mailing list in the Eighties), but added a day delivery service that gives you the option to shop until 10pm and still receive your outfit the following day. Lastly, in contrast to M&S, Next has returned to using top models. The Directory of the Eighties featured Linda Evangelista and Yasmin Le Bon on its cover, and the current one has new face Bette Franke doing the same job – making their high street clothes look like haute couture. No wonder women are flocking back.","Successful Christmas means chain's profits rise at least 12 per cent .

Kiannah, 2, of Fairwater, Cardiff, keeps saying 'F***' after watching an episode of Peppa Pig in which one of the characters appears to say 'f****** gazelles' Like most little girls her age, Kiannah Cox loves everything to do with Peppa Pig. So her mother, Natalie, 30, thought there was no harm in indulging her daughter by letting her watch the cartoon each day. But when Kiannah, two, began regularly using the F-word she was horrified to learn the tot had picked it up from her favourite Peppa DVD. Miss Cox had bought her daughter the cartoon for Christmas, but it wasn't until Kiannah's older brother sat down to watch the DVD with her last month that she realised the youngster had copied the bad language from the television. In the episode, named End of Term Party, Grandpa Rabbit is telling Daddy Pig about Peppa's school teacher Madame Gazelle, who used to play in a pop group. He says the name of the rock band, which is supposed to be the 'Rocking Gazelles,' but Miss Cox claims it sounds like he is saying the 'F-ing Gazelles.' Last night Miss Cox demanded the DVD be pulled from sale until the mistake could be rectified. 'My childminder came home from shopping with Kiannah one day and told me that had been saying 'F-ing' when she saw Peppa toys in a shop,' Miss Cox said. 'I'm a responsible parent and never swear in front of my kids, so I couldn't understand where it had come from. 'Then, a few days later my boy, Isaac, was watching Peppa with Kiannah and came running down the stairs to tell me he had heard it on her DVD. 'I was shocked. We watched it again and I was mortified. 'We realised she was just copying what she had seen on the television.' Scroll down for video . Astley Baker Davies, creator of Peppa Pig, said any misunderstanding was unintentional . Miss Cox said the DVD was obviously not properly scrutinised before going on sale. 'The damage has been done,' Miss Cox, a mother-of-four, from Cardiff, added. 'I don't really care what Grandpa Rabbit is meant to be saying, to anyone who is watching it sounds like F-ing. Peppa Pig is immensely popular with young children, with the series spawning toys, clothes, DVDs and other commodities . 'It has caused me a lot of embarrassment. Kiannah can only say a handful of words, so it was all the more shocking that one of her first was the F-word. 'You don't expect language like that in a Peppa Pig DVD, it's disgusting. 'Nice things are supposed to come out of children's mouths, not that. 'I've tried not to make a big deal of it and now she knows that it is naughty. But I feel like she is being punished for something that's not her fault. I feel bad because I gave her the DVD to watch but I've had to tell her off because of it.' Miss Cox said that Kiannah, and her twin sister, Ebony, who suffers from cerebral palsy, were both born severely premature, at just 26 weeks, so when she decided to move them into their own bedroom just before Christmas it was a 'big deal.' 'We decided to decorate their room with everything Peppa Pig because it was a big deal them being in a bedroom,' she added. 'Now I just want it all gone, I don't want Peppa, she's got to go.' No-one from Entertainment One was available last night for comment.","Kiannah Cox from Cardiff regularly started using the F-word at the age of 2 .

"Judith O'Reilly, 48, decided to do a good deed every day in 2011 . Deeds ranged from making tea for other people's builders to persuading a millionaire to hold a collection for the homeless . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 10:49 EST, 31 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:52 EST, 3 January 2013 . As we prepare to ring 2013 this evening, the thoughts of many of us will already be turning to our New Year's resolution. From diets to exercise regimes or hunting for new jobs, the intention is often there - but in reality, most vows soon fall by the wayside. Not so for one woman though - who at the start of 2011 vowed to carry out a good deed for every single day of the coming year. A full 365 days later, she has succeeded in her mission. Judith O'Reilly, 48, has done a grand total of 365 good deeds last year, from picking up litter on the beach to making cups of tea for other people's builders. Good deeds: Author Judith O'Reilly from has written a book about doing one good deed every day such as making her elderly blind mother Veronica  a cup of tea . As her deeds started to mount up, Judith decided to record them and has now written a book about her challenge: A Year of Doing Good. 'I didn't realise when I made the resolution that New Year what I was taking on,' she says in the epilogue to her book. 'I'd made resolutions before... but the idea of doing one good deed a day morphed into something else again. 'This year made me question what a good life is, how we give our lives meaning, and what it is to love. 'It also taught me that people don't always want the good you want to do, and that doing good - believe you me - is harder than it looks.' O'Reilley goes onto say that the year of doing good is really an admission of her own failings. 'My parents are saints, and it is tough being the parents of saints,' she jokes. 'People feel sorry for the children of murderers, because they think it must be hard worrying whether you've inherited a genetic predisposition to kill as well as those long-lobed ears. 'It is worse when you're brought up by those who are good. Really good.' She calls 2011 the year that for her part, she 'tried to be good'. 'When I can't remember something by name or that shoes should match, I know I'll still remember these years, and that for a year at least, I tried to be good,' she writes. All in a year's work: From picking up litter on the beach to helping out at a local farm, Judith completed one good deed every day in 2011 . A Year Of Doing Good is writer and journalist Judith's third book - her first, Wife In The North, was a bestseller; her second she says is 'living in a drawer' - and this one, her third, she says it is the one she wanted to write in order to help make her a better person. After seeing all the good that her parents and other people had done, she wanted 2011 to be the year of her doing good. Reflecting on her past year, Judith from Alnwick, Northumberland, humorously concluded there were both good and bad things. One such bad thing, she writes, is: 'I am still writing a bloody novel, and everyone who reads it says it is pants.' Charitable: Judith threw herself into plenty of charity work too and even started a jam jar collection where she and others raised £26,000 . Judith's comical tone continues throughout the book and has been highly commended by critics and readers alike. She even makes tongue-in-cheek digs at her husband throughout the book, writing: 'My other New Year's resolution is to stay married. If at all possible'. Each chapter is dedicated to a resolution and they range from tidying a vase of flowers that had fallen over at a child's grave to giving the Queen some blooms when she visited a nearby town. Author: The journalist and author has already written two books, one of which was a bestseller . Her charity work was extensive too. She became a companion for cancer patients, taught mentally disabled children to write and worked with Operation Christmas Child packing shoe boxes. She even set up her own charity collection called the Jam Jar Army whereby she put any loose change into a jam jar. Thousands of people joined her and raised an amazing £26,000 for a variety of good causes. A year of good deeds: Journalist and writer Judith has now published a book of all her good deeds which has been met with rave reviews . The whimsical yet sentimental book has been met with critical acclaim. Stephen G. Post, Phd, Author Of The Hidden Gifts of Helping wrote: 'A Year of Doing Good inspires the reader with the day-to-day journey of meaning, gratification and joy that comes from contributing to the lives of others in so many creative ways. 'For those who want to put ""do unto others"" in the centre of their lives and reap the unexpected benefits of happiness and health, this is the book for you. 'Elegantly written, the words jump off the page,' he said. Jenny Colgan, author of Amanda's Wedding on Wife in the North, said: 'I howled with laughter, tears of recognition at every bloody page. 'My only problem with this book was choosing who to pass it on to first.' Amazon readers were most impressed and touched by the book too with one user writing: 'Beautifully written; a book you won't be able to put down. 'Judith's ability to charm her readers with yet another expertly crafted account of her life as mum, wife, daughter, friend and all round decent human being, continues to embrace and pull at heart-strings. 'I simply love her style of writing; the wit, the humour, the sadness, it's all there - thought provoking and inspirational.' Claire Thorburn wrote: 'Who could have imagined good deeds to fellow men could garner such twists, emotions and ponderings? 'Wife in the North meets Mother Teresa in this beautifully crafted book with its gritty quick-fire wit. It had me alternatively chortling, sniffling and questioning.

These incredible pictures show thirsty white-gaped honeyeater drinking water droplets falling from a tap. Taken by photographer Steve Wilson, 59, from western Australia, these inventive birds can be seen catching the drops before they hit the ground in Purnululu National Park. The honeyeater is a bird indigenous to . Australia, well known for their diversity and their peculiar 'brush . tipped tongue' which they use to take nectar from flowers. A brown honeyeater catching a water droplet falling from a tap . Photographer Steve Wilson, 59, took the pictures in Purnululu National Park in western Australia . The bids are similar to the American Hummingbird, but they lack the evolutionary biology that the hummingbird has, preventing them from having consistent hovering flight. Most honeyeaters eat nectar, but many also feast on insects, with some eating more insects than nectar depending on their whereabouts in the country. Many also feed on the pollen, berries and sap of plants as well as the sugary secretions of plant bugs. Many honeyeaters are very territorial, with larger types often fighting it out with smaller species for the largest and most nectar-filled flowers . Many of the birds move around a lot, searching out different sources of nectar, such as flowering eucalyptus. Other types are more sedentary, and some species are strongly territorial. While several different species of honeyeater often compete for the same resources in the same area, the larger species tend to win the battles for access to flowers, because they can fight off the smaller ones. However, some smaller species can coexist with the large species because they don't need as much food and can sneak into flowering plants if there is enough foliage cover for them to hide from the larger birds. The honeyeater diet is distinctly diverse, and this has caused a rapid differentiation in the amount of species, some focusing on pollen and others focusing on insects . The birds are somewhat similar to the hummingbird, but they lack the biological adaptations necessary for extended hovering flight . Because gardeners tend to grow plants with large floral displays, urban areas can give lots of food for honeyeaters, meaning that they tend to congregate in towns and cities. However, the small honeyeaters often find it hard to compete in these areas, because there is not enough foliage to provide cover for them to hide from the larger species.","Pictures were taken in a national park in western Australia .

Close: Stella McCartney and Cara Delevingne share a hug backstage at the show. Cara, who is currently prioritising her acting career, only walked in a few shows this season and Stella was one of her top picks, as well as Burberry and Giles . Best buddies: While Rihanna and Cara haven't been spotted hanging out a lot lately, the duo were reunited at the show in the French capital today . Continuing the sports luxe love-in, the 42-year-old designer served up little evening dresses with a sporty edge and sporty sweats with zip embellishment. Attention to detail didn't go amiss by Paul McCartney's daughter with hairy textures and silky tassels decorating her garments, plus splashes of tie-dye emblazoned on silky trousers and T-shirts (bound to be a wardrobe staple of Cara's next season). It was a case of 'the bigger the better' when it came to parkas and anoraks, which came complete with mountaineering toggles and digital prints. McCartney, who took a bow with her children at the end of the show, was possibly revisiting the raving youth of the Noughties - also seen at Topshop Unique - and who better to show it off than the ultimate wild child, Cara D?

The White House doesn't like it, and neither does a prominent Senate Republican, but Olympic athletes who win medals in Sochi will have to pay federal income taxes on their cash bonuses. The U.S. Olympic Committee awards $25,000 for each gold medal, $15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze. But top athletes who are in the top income tax bracket , 39.6 per cent, will have to fork over as much as $9,900 of a gold medal payout. Competitors in Sochi, Russia will be able to deduct their expenses that aren't covered by the Olympic Committee or their others sponsors, but there may be additional taxes levied by states and cities on top of what Uncle Sam takes. And adding insult to injury, any precious metals in their medals will also be taxed. The Sochi gold medals will be worth $566, and contain mostly silver. The could drive the total federal tax liability for a gold medal winner north of $10,000. All hail the Olympic taxpayers! Any valuable Americans win in Sochi, and the cash bonuses that come with them, will be subject to hefty federal income taxes . Magic: The Sochi Winter Olympics are underway, and as the u.S. medal count rises, so will Uncle Sam's take of the proceeds . In 2012 Florida Senator Marco Rubio introduced legislation that would exempt Olympic athletes from paying income taxes on their bonuses. The White House said at the time that President Obama supported the measure. 'Our tax code is a complicated and burdensome mess that too often punishes success, and the tax imposed on Olympic medal winners is a classic example of this madness,' said Rubio when he introduced the Olympic Tax Elimination Act. 'Athletes representing our nation overseas in the Olympics shouldn’t have to worry about an extra tax bill waiting for them back home.' A Rubio spokesman told MailOnline that the Republican lawmaker hasn't reintroduced the bill since the end of the last Congress. But some House Republicans, led by Texas Rep. Blake Fahrenthold, have launched a similar effort, he said, and 'we’re seeing how the effort proceeds in that chamber.' Fahrenthold filed his bill on Wednesday, saying that 'this needless tax illustrates how complicated and burdensome our tax code has become. We need a fairer system for all, and eliminating this unnecessary tax burden on our athletes is a good way to start.' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney signaled the president's enthusiasm for Rubio's measure in August 2012 when a reporter asked about it. 'The president believes that we should support efforts – like, I think, the bill you’re referencing – to ensure that we are doing everything we can to honor and support our Olympic athletes who have volunteered to represent our nation at the Olympic Games. So he supports that bill. If it were to get to his desk, he would support it.' Smile: You're not American: British cyclists won gold in London, but they'd be faced with a big tax bill if they were part of Team USA . Not that kind of ring, so no new taxes: The presentation of the Olympic rings was part of the opening ceremony in Sochi, Russia on Friday -- but the fifth ring failed to light up . Americans for Tax Reform, an anti-tax crusader group in Washington led by conservative firebrand Grover Norquist, publicized the Olympic medal taxes on Friday with the suggestion that the U.S. should stop taxing all money earned overseas. 'Because the U.S. is one of only a handful of developed countries that tax income earned abroad, it is likely America's competitors will not be subject to such a tax,' the group said in a statement.' 'Taken together – the tax on Olympic athletes and the tax on income earned abroad – it can be said the U.S. has officially ""earned the Gold"" for having one of the most backwards and illogical tax codes in the world.' Adam Radman, the group's spokesman, told MailOnline that 'it's bad enough that the toilets don't work in Sochi. Now our athletes are going to have to flush their hard-earned prize money down the IRS commode.' The nonpartisan Tax Foundation agrees the the U.S. should adopt a so-called 'territorial' tax system that would allow Americans to bring their overseas earnings back home without fear of hefty taxes. Much of that income has already been taxed in the countries where it was earned. 'There is no reason to privilege the winnings of American Olympians over the income earned by any other hardworking citizen,' the group said.","The U.S. Olympic Committee awards $25,000 for a gold medal, $15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze .
The United States is one of the few countries that taxes money earned outside its borders, at rates as high as 39.6 per cent .
The Olympic medal tax also applies to the value of the base metal in each medal – and gold is currently trading at $1,260 per ounce .
Athletes who excel in Sochi will have to treat their prize money as though it were earned in the U.S., even though they'll be competing in Russia .
House Republicans have a bill that would exempt Olympic athletes from taxes on their medal bonuses, and the White House has expressed support ."

A group of hockey fans in Boise, Idaho, are suing their local arena after it emerged that patrons have been duped into thinking that a $7 beer contains more brew than a $4 beer for the past five years. The lawsuit states that CenturyLink Arena, home of the Idaho Steelheads hockey team, defrauded customers by charging $3 more for a tall, narrow cup advertised as a ‘large’ that actually holds the same amount of beer as the shorter, wider cup described as a ‘small.’ Four fans filed the suit on Tuesday in Boise's 4th District Court against Block 22 LLC, which trades as CenturyLink Arena. Brady Peck, Michele Bonds and William and Brittany Graham are seeking $10,000 in damages. Scroll down for video . Hockey fans Gwen Gibbs and Heath Forsey's YouTube video showed a green liquid being transferred from the large 20oz cup to the regular-sized 16-oz cup and found that the same amount fitted equally into both cups . Gwen Gibbs and Heath Forsey brought the issue to people's attention after posting a YouTube video showing that the cups held exactly the same amount . In the lawsuit, Peck says he's attended at least 30 events over the past three years at the arena, including a hockey game on March 5, and that he's purchased beer each time. The other three plaintiffs say they have been attending sporting events at the venue for five years and that they bought at least one large $7 beer at each event. ‘While different shapes, both cup sizes hold substantially the same amount of liquid and are not large versus small in actual capacity,’ the group's attorney, Wyatt Johnson, wrote in the lawsuit. ‘Defendants knowingly sold each of their beers in a similar manner at each event held at the arena where beer was sold for at least the last five years.’ Video by Gwen Gibbs and Heath Forsey . Ripped-off!

The CenturyLink Arena in Boise, Idaho, has been charging $3 more for a large beer - yet the two cups hold exactly the same amount of beer . The lawsuit was filed just two days after another hockey fan posted a video on YouTube of a beer purchased at CenturyLink Arena on March 8. That video shows a patron holding a large cup of beer and pouring it into an empty small cup. In both cups, the beer reaches nearly to the brim. Gwen Gibbs, who posted the video, told the Idaho Statesman that she was annoyed when she saw her boyfriend, Heath Forsey, pour the large beer into the smaller cup. Angered at the fact that CenturyLink was so brazenly ripping off fans, she uploaded the video on Sunday and the public outcry was immediate - to date it has been watched more than 500,000 times. CenturyLink officials quickly announced . that the company would purchase new cups for the large beers that would . hold 24 ounces instead of the previous 20 ounces for a bigger difference . in size.

Eric Trapp, the president of the Idaho Steelheads hockey team and CenturyLink Arena, denied that his company had been deliberately misleading fans and claimed they didn’t realize that the 16-ounce and 20-ounce cups actually held the same amount.

'As we do every off-season, we’ll evaluate our entire concessions menu for next season over the summer.’ Gibbs – who isn’t suing and just happy that the company had acted so quickly – jokingly told the newspaper that she hoped CenturyLink would rename the 24-ounce cups the ‘Heath and Gwen size.’ ‘It's amazing what can be done with one little video and the power of social media,’ she said.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . PUBLISHED: . 13:49 EST, 3 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:15 EST, 4 March 2014 . Each morning residents of the east India state of Assam watch the sun rise more than 90 minutes earlier than the west of the country. This is because time on the clocks across India are set to be exactly the same in each of its states and provinces, regardless of location. The result is a huge discrepancy between the time shown on the clock and where the sun is in the sky – a problem that this map reveals is widespread throughout the world. Click on the the image to enlarge it... This map shows the difference between clock time and 'solar time'. The 'late' places are shown in red, the 'early' places in green. The deeper the shade, the more out of sync time is . The map, created by Google engineer Stefano Maggiolo, highlights the huge differences between solar time and clock-time in large parts of our planet. Mr Maggiolo said that the map was inspired by a trip to Spain, whose time zone means that Madrid's sunset is more than an hour later than that of Naples. This is because of the latitude and Earth’s tilt as it moves around the sun causing solar daysto  vary throughout the year. ‘The modern calendar compensates by letting midday oscillate a bit around the year,’ explains Mr Maggiolo, in his blog. Large parts of the U.S. and Canada have a discrepancy of around an hour between solar time and clock time . Mr Maggiolo said that the map was inspired by a trip to Spain, whose time zone means that Madrid's sunset is more than an hour later than that of Naples . A solar day is the length of time between the sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times. The length of a solar day varies . throughout the year, and the accumulated effect of these variations . produces seasonal deviations of up to 16 minutes. This is because of Earth's tilt and its elliptical orbit as it moves around the sun. The Earth moves fastest when it is closest to the sun  and slowest when it is furthest away. This 'unequal motion' causes variations in the length of the solar day and in the times of sunrise and sunset. For example, midday in Naples goes from 11:47 in early November to 12:17 in early February. The map reveals that the sun rises and sets later in the day than it should in a larger part of the world, with the late places shown in red and the early places in green. Most of Russia is heavily red, but mostly in zones with very scarce population. The exception is St. Petersburg, with a discrepancy of two hours. ‘It seems strange that time systems with such a huge problem had ever been practical,’ notes Mr Maggiolo. ‘But in the pre-industrial-revolution world travels were so uncommon and slow that this problem was no more than a minor annoyance.’ The change from solar time, where all days have different lengths, to solar meantime, where midday wanders around 12:00, came about due to the increase in mechanical clocks in the 19th century. The development of rapid railway systems and the consequent confusion of schedules that used scores of different local times led to the introduction of time zones as we know them. ‘Indeed, if we acknowledge that the two problems must be solved, the natural result is the current time zone system,’ said Mr Maggiolo. The sun rises earlier in some parts of western Australia as shown by the green in this map. This is because the length of a solar day varies throughout the year, and the accumulated effect of these variations  produces seasonal deviations of up to 16 minutes . This might go some way to explain why people in Spain tend to stay up later. The country’s time zone puts it an hour ahead of the UK despite being on the same longitude . ‘The immediate consequence is that in the western part of the time zone the sun rises and sets later than in the eastern part,’ said Mr Maggiolo. ‘Normally, these differences amount to at most half an hour in either direction, but human geography sometime forces greater differences.’ Politics also comes into play for some of the discrepancies seen in the map. For instance, in China all the clocks are set to Beijing time. This means in the western part of the country, marked in deep red on the map, solar noon takes place at three in the afternoon. In Xinjiang province, the Uighur minority makes a point of observing its own time and not that of local Han Chinese. Politics also comes into play for some of the discrepancies seen in the map. For instance, in China all the clocks are set to Beijing time.

"PUBLISHED: . 17:45 EST, 3 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:01 EST, 3 January 2014 . Third-round weekend. Just saying those words takes me back to childhood and triggers the excitement I had for the FA Cup. What a competition it used to be. From the start of the season to the beginning of December, I would regularly think about which team Everton would get drawn against on the first Saturday in January. The excitement and anticipation was massive because everyone was dreaming about Wembley. I still remember the buzz of the build-up to the third round, taking in all the unusual stories in the papers, on the radio and TV about little-known players who had dreams of becoming household names. Third-round day itself was mixed with nerves and excitement. If I wasn't at the game, I'd be sat in front of the TV, glued to Grandstand. Party time: Jamie Carragher with Jam Kromkamp, Jerzy Dudek and Pepe Reina after winning the FA Cup in 2006 . Reflective: Carragher, pictured with the FA Cup in 2001 (right) and 2006 reckons replays should be abolished . We take it for granted now that goal updates come through immediately on websites, Soccer Saturday or to your phone but 25 years ago, you would pray for good news to flash up on the vidiprinter at the bottom of the screen. Back in the 1980s, if you asked fans in August which trophy they would prefer to win, either the League Championship or the FA Cup, it would come down to the toss of a coin. That's how big it was: if a side's form in the league had tailed off by Christmas, the crowds would flock back for the third round. I loved it when I was a kid and I loved it when I was a player, too. I cherish the two medals I won in 2001 and 2006, after Liverpool's victories against Arsenal and West Ham at the Millennium Stadium. In 2001, as we chased an unprecedented cup treble, Gerard Houllier would regularly tell us the UEFA Cup would be the pinnacle of that campaign. In many respects he was right: you don't get the chance to win a European trophy every season. But for the English players in the dressing room, we were desperate to get our hands on the FA Cup. Now, though, its appeal is on the wane and Paul Lambert's alarming comments about it being a commitment that Aston Villa could do without have illustrated where clubs see their priorities. The Barclays Premier League has become the be-all and end-all; such is the intensity of the competition and the excitement generated, every Saturday feels like third-round weekend once did. That competition dominates to such an extent that if you ask fans now which they would prefer - to win the FA Cup or finish in the top four - the vast majority would pick the latter. In the spotlight: Villa boss Paul Lambert sparked controversy when he questioned the importance of the FA Cup . I understand the finances involved, but isn't football all about savouring the magical days when you get to celebrate a piece of silverware? As a fan, I'd rather be in Wigan's situation of last season. Those supporters will have memories to take to the grave. Nobody remembers mid-table mediocrity. The major thing I would do to revive it would be to abolish replays - all ties would have to reach a conclusion on the same day. I'd even be tempted to do away with extra-time and go straight to a penalty shootout if it was a draw at 90 minutes. Replays are a waste of time. You rarely, if ever, see capacity crowds for replays now and it is embarrassing when games are staged with rows of empty seats in the background. That shows what fans think of them. They also put an unnecessary strain on players in terms of fitness and create fixture congestion. Sight for sore eyes: There were plenty of empty seats at last season's replay between West Brom and QPR . Few and far between: Fans didn't turn out in force for Wigan's FA Cup visit to the Stadium of Light in 2008 . If you scrapped replays, you could move a round of league fixtures from the festive period, when players are vulnerable to muscle problems, back to a later date. Playing twice in three days at Christmas is ridiculous. A win-or-bust situation would also leave managers thinking twice about making significant changes; plus, with rounds three, four and five being on weekends when no league games are scheduled, there would be no need to rest players if you knew there would be no replay looming. Some will say that axeing replays would deprive lower division clubs of the chance to get a payday but what would be more special for them - the chance to dramatically claim a huge scalp or just going somewhere for a day out with no realistic chance of winning? Another thing I would do is stage semi-finals at neutral venues. I played in semi-finals at Villa Park, Old Trafford and Wembley. While the one at Wembley was one of the best days of my career - we came from behind to beat Everton - the national stadium should be for one-off matches. Wembley should always feel special. Day to remember: Wigan sprung a huge surprise when they beat Manchester City in last season's final . Time to celebrate: Carragher with team-mate Steven Gerrard in 2006 . You would rather win the FA Cup than the Capital One Cup, but it feels as if the FA Cup is playing second fiddle at the minute. The League Cup has all the drama, the games are staged under lights, while the final itself stands alone in February, unlike the FA Cup, which competes with the climax of the Premier League and Champions League. In 2011, remember, there was the ludicrous situation where Manchester City won the FA Cup on the same day Manchester United won the title. What the League Cup has done is move with the times, as have the Premier League and the Champions League. They have evolved and are miles better than they were 20 years ago but, sadly, you can't say that about the FA Cup. People like its tradition but life moves at a different pace now and there is no place for watching the Cup final on TV from 9am, as we used to. Some broadcasters tried that recently and it doesn't work. So while the FA Cup is not on its last legs, I believe these small changes would make a difference. For a tournament that has given such joy to so many, it deserves to be helped. It has been good to see Joe Hart remind people over Christmas what a top goalkeeper he is. He was man of the match when Manchester City beat Liverpool, got a black eye for his efforts against Crystal Palace and showed he has benefited from being taken out of the firing line by Manuel Pellegrini. It is often said quality keepers are worth 10-12 points during a season and Hart has made a difference to City over the festive period. His saves against Liverpool and Palace turned two draws into wins. Back in action: Joe Hart has been restored to the Manchester City first team after his spell on the bench . I admire Pellegrini for being so bold. Hart is a far better keeper than Costel Pantilimon and was always going to get his place back but many other managers might have ducked the issue. The most impressive thing, however, was Hart's reaction. He could not have dealt with it any better; he kept his thoughts to himself, he never went running to the press or created any tension. I know how it feels to be out of the team when you think you should be playing. The only thing you can do, though, is take your medicine, keep your dignity and grab your chance when it comes along. Hart's done all those things and is getting his just rewards. I outlined . my hopes for the coming 12 months in last week's column, but now is the . time to make a few predictions. There are five major trophies up for . grabs between now and the end of the season and here's who I think will . lift them. 1 PREMIER LEAGUE: Chelsea - They were my tip at the start of . the season and I'm not deserting them. Manchester City have been the . most impressive team so far but Jose Mourinho is the best manager in the . league and could prove decisive. 2 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE: Real Madrid - It . is about time they won it again. Cristiano Ronaldo deserves it for the . way he has performed but the big thing in Madrid's favour is they have a . kind draw. They can come out on top in the Lisbon final. Blue moon: Chelsea and Real Madrid are Carragher's favourites to win the Premier League and European Cup . 3 FA CUP: . Liverpool - Teams who do not have Europe on their schedule, such as . Everton and Newcastle, will be looking to target this trophy but . Liverpool are enjoying a great season and have the weapons to beat . anyone on their day. 4 CAPITAL ONE CUP: Manchester City - It looks like . it will be an all-Manchester affair at Wembley on March 2 and after . their game at the Etihad this season, a 4-1 City win, you would have to . favour Manuel Pellegrini's men to come out on top. 5 EUROPA LEAGUE: . Napoli - They were unlucky not to make the Champions League knockout . stages. But, having spent heavily last summer, they are one of the best . teams in the Europa League and, in Rafa Benitez, they have the manager . who won it last season. Kop idol: Could Luis Suarez inspire Liverpool to FA Cup glory this term?","Replays are a waste of time and put an unnecessary strain on the players .
Semi-final clashes must be played at a neutral venue with Wembley saved for the showpiece .
The Champions League, Premier League and League Cup have evolved over the last 20 years - the FA Cup hasn't .
Joe Hart has proved he is a class act for Manchester City and England ."

When Doug Ibbs and Deni Daniel appeared on Grand Designs back in 2004 after buying an enormous ruin in rural France, a sceptical Kevin McCloud proclaimed they’d got ‘carried away with the romance of it all’ – and wasn’t  at all sure they’d ‘thought it through’. The couple, both divorcees who had met five years previously, bought the tumble-down 19th Century manor house on  a whim after stumbling across an advert for it online. The odds didn’t look good – neither of them spoke French, they had no experience with building work and they hadn’t even been intending to move overseas when they bought the house just two days after spotting it. They sold their Dorset home and gave up steady jobs in Britain (Doug was an engineer and Deni worked in sales and marketing.) Scroll down for video . Transformed: The five-storey property in the Limousin region in central France appeared on Grand Designs in 2004 and is now on the market for £495,000 . The five-storey property in the department of Creuse in the Limousin region in central France had been the headquarters of the local Resistance movement during the war. It was discovered and burnt down by the Germans in 1944, and since then it had not been touched. But just a few months after first seeing  the property, Kevin was forced to eat his words. ‘Every time I’ve visited I’ve been more and more blown away by Doug and Deni,’ he said on the show. ‘They’ve proved that through sheer dogged optimism, it’s possible to tackle almost anything.’ Fourteen months after buying the manor house, the couple, who lived in a caravan in the garden while the work was being done, opened their doors to paying guests. Dilapidated: This is what the mansion looked like before the restoration 11 years ago, having not been touched since the German army destroyed it in 1944 . Pride and glory: The property was the headquarters of the local Resistance movement during World War II and was left untouched for nearly 60 years . Big project: Doug Ibbs and Deni Daniel appeared on Grand Designs back in 2004 after buying the enormous ruin in rural France . Now, ten years after the show aired on Channel 4, they have put the property on the market for €599,960 – about £495,000. Both 64, they are keen to retire and spend more time with their children and grandchildren (they have five children and four grandchildren between them.) Their pensions won’t allow them to maintain a large property like Chez Jallot, which comes with four acres of land, without keeping it running as a business. ‘It breaks our hearts to have to sell and we’re doing so with a lot of regret,’ says  Doug. ‘But it’s an experience we can look back on and say, wow, we did that.’ Something about the intrepid pair must have struck a chord with Grand Designs viewers. Since Chez Jallot opened its doors in November 2004, they have been inundated with bookings from viewers charmed by the couple’s French dream. Some guests have been from as far as Australia, where the show aired a couple of years after it did in Britain. Converted: Kevin McCloud initially told the couple they had gotten 'carried away with the romance of it all' but was forced to eat his words . ‘In the first few years all our guests were viewers of the show,’ says Deni. ‘We haven’t had to spend any money on marketing at all. Now we get a lot of word-of-mouth bookings and return visitors and people who’ve read the reviews online.’ Doug adds: ‘We’ve met people from every continent in the world. The international gatherings around our dining tables in the evenings have been really great.’ He says the couple often have house-hunters staying with them – perhaps hoping they’ll be able to pick up some advice. The Limousin region has about 10,000 British residents and attractions include Lake Vassivière, France’s largest man-made lake (a 15-minute drive from Chez Jallot). Since the show, the couple have carried  on building. When they started having guests, only the first two storeys were habitable. They completed the rest of the house, which now has seven en suite bedrooms, in 2006. In 2009 they converted the derelict barn into two self-catering gites. Doug and Deni bought Chez Jallot for £36,000 in 2003 and although they originally earmarked about £100,000 for doing it up,  like most Grand Designers they far exceeded their budget. ‘The total must be about half a million euros,’  admits Deni. The couple aren’t selling Chez Jallot as a business as they would have to pay capital gains tax, although they are happy to offer advice to buyers who want to run a similar concern. They plan to stay in the area and buy or even build something smaller. According to Paul Haskett of Legget estate agents, who are selling the property, now is  a tricky time to be selling as the market is depressed in France. Prices in the Limousin dropped by almost 16 per cent last year, compared to three to four per cent in the rest of France, and many homeowners are in negative equity. ‘Prices are set to drop further this year. So it’s definitely a buyers’ market,’ says Paul. The French Resistance was a collection of movements that fought against the Nazi occupation of France and against the collaborationist Vichy régime during World War II. Résistance cells were small groups of men and women who carried out guerrilla warfare that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines. The men and women of the Résistance came from all economic levels and political leanings of French society, including conservatives, liberals, anarchists, and communists.

It's hard not to think anxiously about last year's bombings as the Boston Marathon approaches next month. To help Bostonians deal with difficult and perhaps unexpected emotions, therapists will be stationed along the sidelines of the marathon route to talk to those who are suffering. Dr. Chris Carter of Spaulding Rehab Hospital in Boston believes that people may feel uneasy during the festivities. 'They may be feeling a little more on edge. A little more tearful perhaps or a little more irritable and less patient,' he told CBS. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Last year's Boston marathon was tragic after terrorists set off bombs at the finish line . Dr. Chris Carter will be at the Boston Marathon this year to support the runners raising money for his rehab center . Carter also explains how people may experience negative emotions at the time of the marathon without realizing what they are linked to. People who did not participate in the race may be overwhelmed even though they did not experience the trauma directly. Not only is grieving necessary says Carter, so is looking back at how far Boston has come as a community. 'The progress these guys have been able to make is largely because of the generosity of strangers. In the midst of the horror and all the evil that was there, look at the good thatâ€™s been coming out,' he said. Carter will be in Hopkinton on Marathon Monday to support the runners raising money for his rehab. He spoke of the importance of coming together to help one another after the tragic event. Carter has helped many survivors come to terms with their fear and anger but says it is really the community that must help one another cope with overcoming obstacles. 'The progress these guys have been able to make is largely because of the generosity of strangers. In the midst of the horror and all the evil that was there, look at the good thatâ€™s been coming out,' he said. Being, or more appropriately the mantra 'Boston Strong,' doesn't have to do with being happy all the time. All people should expect to feel anxious sometimes, because overcoming adversity makes people stronger and brings them together. Carter stressed that recovery has very much to do with help from the Boston community at large .

A woman's mummified body has been discovered in her car inside her garage and investigators believe that she has been dead for several years.

The body was discovered on Wednesday when a contractor went into the house because it is going into foreclosure. Scroll down for video . Crime scene? A woman was found mummified in the backseat of her Jeep inside the garage of her Detroit home and she may have been there for upwards of three years . Local station WXYZ reports that the contractor found the woman, who is said to be in her 40s, in the backseat of her Jeep Liberty. The woman was German and worked at one of the 'Big Three' car companies- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler- who all have their headquarters in the region. She was also thought to have a son, but his age and whereabouts remain a mystery. Neighbors on Savannah Road in the Pontiac neighborhood said that the woman kept to herself and travelled often so it was not unusual to not see her for long periods of time. Investigation: The body was found when a contractor went into the home because it is going into foreclosure . No activity: Neighbors said the owner, who was a German woman in her 40s, traveled extensively for work and was gone for long periods of time . One neighbor said that the last time they saw any activity at the home was three years ago, while another last remembers seeing the woman six years ago. 'She didn’t really talk to anyone.  I’m sure she was a nice lady. She really kept to herself.  We never really heard anything from her,' neighbor Caitlyn Talbot told WXYZ. 'She was probably there for a couple of days, then she’d leave for a week, then she’d come back.  Then she’d leave for a month and come back. 'You’d think because of her job, and we heard she had a son, so you’d think someone would’ve come looking for her.'

A man who tried to evade Colorado cops by allegedly carjacking three cars - including one with a four-year-old boy inside - has been captured following a 75-mile high speed chase. Ryan Stone, a 29-year-old who was wanted in a drug case, caused multiple pile ups on Wednesday and then tried to out-run police on foot but eventually surrendered when he could not climb a fence. Dramatic helicopter footage captured the chase that was televised live during the morning rush hour. A state trooper was injured after being struck by Stone while putting down stop sticks in a bid to stop him, but it is not clear if this was intentional. The little boy in the carjacked vehicle was not harmed. Start of the chase: Ryan Stone, 29, drives an allegedly stolen red SUV, left, with a boy inside on Wednesday . Second car: Footage shows Stone leaving the red SUV with the child and carjacking another vehicle . Aggressive: He then allegedly stole a gray minivan and rammed another car on the road . Violent: He then hit another vehicle, pictured, and pulled its driver from inside and then her to the ground . Longmont Police Department spokesman . Jeff Satur said a warrant had been issued for Stone after he failed to . appear in court March 4 on a 'dangerous drug' charge. Stone . was with his girlfriend when she was stopped in an apparently stolen . car in Longmont Tuesday night, he said. Stone was not picked up then, . but it's not clear why. Then . at 6am on Wednesday, Stone allegedly stole a sport utility vehicle with . four-year-old Allen Chavarria-Rodriquez inside from a gas station in . Longmont, north of Denver. The boy's mother had left the car with the boy in it as she went inside the gas station, and the suspect jumped . into the vehicle and sped south on Interstate 70. Caught: Then at an intersection 75 miles from the start of the chase, police caught up with him . Desperate: He jumped from the car and tried to make a run from it as police circled him . Making a run for it: Stone, who was wanted for drug offenses, ran through the snow to escape . Stopped: But he had trouble climbing a fence and police caught up with him and he was arrested . An Amber Alert was released to locate the boy and a surveillance image of Stone was released. At 7.15am, a State Patrol . officer spotted the vehicle in the Thornton area. After about a half hour, Stone . stopped and carjacked a minivan and took off in it the wrong direction . on the highway. He eventually got into the right lane before rear-ending another car. After the smash caused the minivan to lose a tire, he hit another vehicle . and threw the female driver out of the car and jumped behind the wheel, leaving her screaming at the side of the road. For most of the time, police appeared to hang back, even after the suspect abandoned the SUV stolen with the boy in it. In custody: Ryan Stone, left, was arrested and four-year-old Allen Chavarria-Rodriguez, who had been inside one of the stolen cars, was returned safely to his family. He was shaken up but otherwise unharmed . Safe: His mother, pictured, left him in the car while she went to the gas station but left to find him missing . Search: After Stone took off with the boy, authorities released this photo of him to track him down . As he neared an intersection, he collided with another vehicle and was surrounded by police. Cornered, he jumped out and tried to escape on foot. He . ran off, crossing the parking lot of a business and running so wildly . he lost his jacket.

'Holy [expletive] I found my sisters Rosie Briggs Franklin and Dollie Conant,' she wrote on March 11. The story soon spread far enough to reach the women. 'Here was my sister that I had no idea she was even . alive, holding a picture with my mom's name and ""I am . looking for my family"",' Franklin said. 'I was just shocked. I just sat . there for a minute and looked at it like, ""is this for real?""' Found: After their meeting, Oliver, right, and Franklin, left, drove to see their other sister, Dollie Conant, center. The women said they didn't know their sister's real name or if she was even alive . Happy: The women live in different states but said they have the rest of their lives to make up for lost time . Franklin . and Conant, who had grown up together, knew their mother had given birth to . another girl, but they knew her as 'Jenni' and thought she had died or suffered serious problems because of their mother's addiction. Franklin said that she would never have known the truth had it not been for Oliver's plea because they had the wrong name. After the emotional meeting between Franklin and Oliver, they drove to Lima to see Conant. The women shared photos of the three of them together on their Facebook profiles.

A woman living next-door to a gigantic sinkhole said she complained her house was sinking dangerously six weeks ago - but her housing association landlords told her 'everything was all right'. Call centre worker Carla Rance, 35, had her entire porch demolished after it sank 'five or six inches' - but claimed her landlords only sent round specialist insurance assessors after she phoned her MP. The 35ft wide sinkhole opened up in a suburban cul-de-sac in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, at 7.30am today, forcing 17 houses to be evacuated and leaving one teetering over a 20ft drop. Two of the houses could have to be demolished. Scroll down for video . Teetering: The corner of a house has been left dangling perilously over a 20ft sinkhole in Hemel Hempstead . Carla Rance (left) said she warned her housing association about the sink hole, saying: 'I was ringing them on a daily basis in tears' Mother-of-three Ms Rance told MailOnline: 'They came and chucked me out in my pyjamas - I just had time to shove on a pair of jeans and a jumper. I was shaking. 'My children had their onesies on and my daughter has a kidney problem - I had to persuade the police to get her medicine from the fridge. My purse is sitting on my kitchen table with all my money in it.' Ms Rance, who lives in the house next-door to the one over the sinkhole with her sons Connor, 14, and Taylor, 11, daughter Lexi, seven, and boyfriend Ross Miller, 30, will be in a hotel until at least Monday. She said she first rang her housing association's out-of-hours hotline on January 4 when her house 'sank overnight' but a full day later they had sent no one. Furious, she contacted the local council, which immediately cordoned off her porch and had it demolished after telling her it collapse at any moment, she said. Dramatic: 17 houses have been evacuated in from the quiet suburban cul-de-sac in Hertfordshire . 'It's over there': Police and structural and gas engineers point to the massive sinkhole outside the home . 'I was furious,' she said. 'They told me they thought there might be some sort of water leak that had softened the foundations of the house. It's in a shocking state but they were telling me it was normal. 'I was ringing them on a daily basis in tears because last week I couldn't even open my front door. The man from the housing association told me to wiggle the handle. 'They told me repeatedly everything was all right... They've not been interested in me at all.' Ms Rance said she then involved Hemel Hempstead MP Mike Penning - and only after that her landlords sent round insurance assessors, 10 days ago, who spent two and a half hours examining her house. Two days ago they told her they would be coming round to dig an exploratory trench - but the sinkhole opened up before they had the chance. Ms Rance said: 'The MP rang me this afternoon from Venice, bless him. He said he was furious.' MailOnline contacted the housing association, Hightown Homes, for comment and had not yet received a reply. My porch! Carla Rance, 35, had her sinking porch demolished six weeks ago . Authorities are looking into it: The sinkhole is the latest in a string of landslips caused by extreme weather . Lucky chance: Andrew Abbott, pictured, moved out of the house over the sinkhole last night after his tenancy ended. It's thought three people were still living there but did not even wake up when it appeared . The house over the sinkhole is believed to have been occupied by three people, including lodgers. One lodger, Andrew Abbott, had moved out by coincidence only last night after his tenancy ended. Neighbours on the estate - built just six years ago - said they have been told two houses will have to be demolished. Dacorum Borough Councillor Graham Adshead inspected the hole this morning and said: 'If the house is not pulled down, it will fall down. There is nothing underneath it. The entire corner of the house is unsupported. The road is basically a bridge and the house has nothing supporting it. 'The rumour is that there were lime kilns here in the past, before my time. There were holes underground and they have got bigger with all the heavy rain. 'This isn't the first sink hole in the area. They have been trying to fill one in down the road for years' - Taxi driver Jeff Bray, 58 . 'The rain is the hair that broke the camel's back, and that the hole has got bigger and bigger with the heavy rain. Taxi driver Jeff Bray, 58, whose flat overlooks the hole, said: 'The police knocked on my door at 7.45 this morning to say the houses were being evacuated. It was quite a shock, but this isn't the first sink hole in the area. They have been trying to fill one in down the road for years. One of the residents evacuated was a heavily-pregnant woman. Her partner was briefly allowed back into their semi-detached home to collected items needed for the birth. A Hertfordshire police spokesman said: 'The hole, which is in a residential cul de sac, has mainly affected the road. 'However, 17 properties have been evacuated for the safety of residents in the area. 'The hole is approximately 35ft wide and 20ft deep. 'Police are working with partner agencies, including Dacorum Borough Council, specialist structural engineers and utilities companies to assess the situation. 'The road, and surrounding roads, have been closed for the safety of residents and whilst agencies work at the scene.' The house could be seen being held up by triangular struts as dozens of police officers and utility workers gathered around it. Police officers secured the scene while gas and electric engineers acted to cut off local supply. The alarm was raised around 7am when a builder who was driving down the road stopped and noticed the huge crater at the side of the house. He knocked on neighbours' doors before calling the police. Evacuated: The crater opened up in a quiet suburb of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire . Destroyed: The hole was littered with what looked like pipework and fencing. Police are investigating . Investigation: Police have been at the scene since the sinkhole suddenly opened up at 7.30am today . Police: A spokesman said the force was working with 'Dacorum Borough Council, specialist structural engineers and utilities companies to assess the situation' Hole: At first glance the sinkhole appears like an ordinary flower bed - but it is some 20ft deep, said police . Urban sinkholes are more common after heavy rain, because they are caused by water flowing through channels below ground and eroding away soil or soft rock like limestone. As the earth is carried into other parts of the ground large caverns can open up, usually unknown to the authorities or the people living above them . Once the cavern cannot support the weight of the topsoil above it, it collapses into the ground. One of the world's largest sinkholes, the Xiaozhai Tiankeng in China, is more than 2,000ft deep. An Affinity Water spokesman said: 'Affinity Water was called by the Police at 8.20am and a team arrived on site shortly after. 'Water was leaking outside one home due to a dislodged supply pipe, so the supply to that property was turned off at the boundary supply stop tap. 'The road has been closed and we are awaiting further instructions from the structural engineers in attendance on when we can return to site.' It comes after a 15ft-deep hole appeared on the central reservation of the M2 near Sittingbourne, Kent, on Tuesday. Initially . thought by the authorities to be a sinkhole, it was revealed to be a . chalk well called a Dene hole, a structure made up of several . underground caves accessed by a vertical shaft. Hertfordshire, the site of today's . hole, has a history of chalk mining dating back to Roman times. Chalk was used since the Medieval period as a building material. Hemel Hempstead was largely built in a chalk stone valley where the River Gade meets the River Bulbourne. The modern housing estate was built in 2008. It was believed the homes were constructed on former industrial estate land, or what is known as a brownfield site. There . are more than 100 historic mines known throughout the county but when . the mining stopped, the entrances to their vertical shafts were not . recorded properly and can cause nasty surprises for homeowners later on. About 100 years ago 'chalk-drawers' worked throughout the Chiltern Hills, mining chalk from shafts up to 30ft deep which have since caused countless small collapses in fields, according to the Hertfordshire Geological Society. Good as new: Zoe Smith, 19, with her new car after her local council filled in a 30ft hole with concrete . Dude, where's my car? Zoe's Volkswagen Lupo vanished into this hole on her parents' drive . Huge: This 15ft-deep hole on the central reservation of the M2 in Kent was discovered to be a chalk well . Earlier this month, a sinkhole . measuring 30ft deep swallowed up a car after opening up on the driveway . of Phil and Liz Conran's home in High Wycombe. Nobody was inside the Volkswagen Lupo - owned by their devastated daughter Zoe, 19 - when the ground gave way underneath it. The family said there was no indication that the sinkhole would appear on February 2. Mrs . Conran, a 51-year-old school bursar, said at the time: 'The actual size . of it is what I think has taken us most by surprise - it's just . swallowed the car whole.' Zoe . expressed her delight after motoring website Auto Trader bought her a . new car this week after the council plugged the hole with concrete. She had gone into hysterics after . discovering her prized car had disappeared into the 30ft crater and was . barely visible beneath mounds of earth.

A member of Jodi Arias' legal team has been banned from visiting her in jail after she was caught bringing a piece of the convicted murderer's art out of the Arizona facility. Maria De La Rosa, a mitigation specialist who is trying to build a case that will humanize Arias and help convince a jury not to sentence her to death, was found carrying one of Arias' drawings out of the Maricopa County jail in late February. De La Rosa and the rest of Arias' legal team argued that the artwork is part of her defense case, and they planned to display it to the jury when her sentencing trial begins on September 8. Ban: Maria De La Rosa, seen right next to Jodi Arias after her guilty verdict was handed down in May, was found bringing one of Arias' drawings out of prison and is no longer allowed to visit as a result . The sheriff's office was concerned that she was carrying the drawing- which showed a multi-color drawing of a pinwheel- on behalf of Arias in order to deliver it to someone on the outside. 'The only material provided to Maria was legal material, and I find what the jail is doing is outrageous,' Ms De La Rosa's attorney Dan Raynak told The Arizona Republic. 'I personally find it outrageous, because Maria is beyond reproach and is one of the finest mitigation specialists I've worked with.' One of Arias' lawyers from her murder trial confirmed that they regularly brought her artwork out of prison because they presented some of it during the five-month trial that started on January 2, 2013 and ended on May 8 after the jury reached a guilty verdict following 15 hours of deliberation. Color work: Jodi Arias has been producing drawings while in prison as she waits to have a new jury determine whether she will face the death penalty or life in jail . Arias, who murdered her boyfriend Travis Alexander, is in jail awaiting a second round in court where a new jury will determine whether or not she should be sentenced to the death penalty or life in prison. The sentencing trial is set for September 8 after rounds of delays. Arias, a photographer by trade, has been working actively on her drawing skills and  used it as a form of income during her trial by selling off works that she made from behind bars. Supporters have maintained a website where her work is available for sale. Waiting for the next step: Arias' lawyers also put in a motion to have the possibility of the death penalty taken out of the jury's range of options but no verdict has been handed down on that . Her rates have gone down dramatically since her guilty verdict was handed down in May, however. Her drawings were being sold for thousands at the peak of the trial- like one of Grace Kelly that went for $3,050- as opposed to the two drawings currently available on the site. Both pieces- one of a sailboat at sunset and another of a vase of calla lillies- are on sale for $39. The Arizona Republic reports that Arias' legal team submitted multiple motions to Judge Sherry Stephens on Monday including one to allow Ms De La Rosa to be able to visit the county jails both for Arias and her other death row clients. Another motion pushed for the death penalty to be removed from the list of options that will be presented to the new jury.","Maria De La Rosa, a mitigation specialist working with Arias' legal team, has been caught bringing one of the murderer's drawings out of prison .

Two fishing boat workers are suspected of stabbing to death a 45-year-old father of two whose body was discovered at a Bahamas resort this weekend. Carl Yerger of Ruscombmanor Township, Pennsylvania was in the Bahamas on a business trip when his body was discovered with several stab wounds on the grounds of the Bimini Big Game Club Resort & Marina early Friday morning. Two men working on a boat docked at the resort's marina were arrested in connection with Yerger's death and arraigned on manslaughter charges Tuesday in Nassau, though those charges could be upgraded to murder after authorities finish their investigation. Gaylordsville, Connecticut-native Robert Schwartz, 62, and 19-year-old Tyler Valles, of Key Largo, Florida, were 'subdued' and 'quiet' as they were lead into court handcuffed together, a journalist for ZNS-TV reported. The attorney representing the two suspects said Yerger was killed in an accident, after the milling-company owner wandered drunk onto their boat. Valles and Schwartz say Yerger came on the boat earlier that day and had been told to leave. An intoxicated Yerger later returned to the boat and a 'struggle' ensued between the three men. Initially four men were arrested in connection to Yerger's killing, but two were released pending the investigation.

She says he was visitng the island for business but planned to do some fishing as well. He was staying at the same resort where his body was found. Bimini is a popular destination for deep-sea fishing and is located approximately 50 miles off the Florida coast. Piecing together the mystery: The manslaughter charges against Valles and Schwartz could be upgraded to murder pending the investigation. Above, another picture of Valles from his Facebook . In addition to running his milling business, Yerger volunteered as the president of the Oley Valley Youth Sports League. The league issued a statement following news of Yerger's passing, saying he 'inspired everyone he met and energized the small but tight-knit sports community of Oley'.

Toyota and the federal government reportedly are about to announce a settlement to the tune of $1 billion following a Justice Department probe of how the automaker handled customer complaints about unintended acceleration the company at one point attributed to faulty floor mats. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's office began investigating allegations that the Japanese automaker misled federal authorities in 2009, after complaints about the unintended acceleration became a source of controversy. The agreement allows Toyota to avoid any potential criminal charges that could be brought against employees in the future, and requires the company to shell out a $1 billion fine. Unintended acceleration: Toyota initially tried to resolve the issues with the cheap fix of replacing floor mats . Deal: U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has slapped Toyota with a $1 billion fine for its handling of acceleration issues in some of its most popular vehicles . The agreement was first reported by CNN. 'Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney's office in this matter for more than four years,' a Toyota spokeswoman told the cable news network. 'During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.' Bharara's office and the Justice Department declined to comment on what for now is only a planned announcement. For years, Toyota responded to complaints about acceleration issues in some of its most popular models by doing little more than changing floor mats. Recall: Toyota was forced in 2009 to issue a massive recall of some of its most popular vehicles . In 2009-10, the car company was forced to recall millions of vehicles after it became clear that floor mats were not the main cause of the many cases of unintended acceleration problems. In addition to Toyota, motor vehicle regulators were criticized for how they responded to the acceleration issues the company was having leading up to the massive recall. Following the recall, Toyota executives were forced to appear in two Congressional hearings, at which lawmakers criticized their response to complaints regarding acceleration issues with some of the company's top-selling models. Next: Bharara also is investigating similar claims made against General Motors . In addition to the agreement with the Justice Department, Toyota has agreed to similar settlements with state governments, as well as car owners. The settlement with Toyota comes as the Justice Department begins a probe into safety issues with General Motors vehicles. According to CNN, GM has recalled 1.6 million vehicles across the globe over a faulty ignition switch. The probe is into whether GM engineers knew about the problems years ago, but only issued a recall last month.","The deal protects Toyota executives from criminal prosecution .

Water-carved rocks high on a Martian mountain have revealed that Nasa's Curiosity rover could actually be driving through a giant dried up lake bed. The new finding comes from Gale Crater, where NASA's Curiosity rover landed in 2012.

The signs of a giant lake: The boxwork structures on Mount Sharp are shown in red (upper left inset map, Gale Crater). Lower right inset shows detail of boxwork formation (scale bar represents 50¿meters).  Gale crater is 155¿km in diameter for scale. Researchers believe the telltale patterns could only have been made by water - meaning the mountain was once surrounded by a giant lake. 'Detailed mapping of the filled fracture network on Mount Sharp indicates that this sedimentary layer most likely represents large-scale boxwork fabricsm' they say in the journal Journal of Geological Research: Planets. 'These deposits provide evidence for extensive and relatively rapid cement formation, which could be beneficial to the preservation of organic compounds, 1050 m above the current floor of Gale Crater.' By studying images of the surface, the team were even able to estimate how big the giant lake was. 'Volumes of diagenetic cements can be measured from orbital imagery, and based on these measurements and an assumed chemistry, the minimum volume of water required to form the cements measured was calculated to be about 0.4 km3.' Spread around Mount Sharp, that would translate to roughly the amount of water in Boston Harbor. The researchers say they have the perfect opportunity to study the area, thanks to the Curiosity rover, and say it could still hold organic compounds from the ancient lake. The possible ancient configurations of Mount Sharp that would allow sufficient groundwater flow to form the boxwork structures spotted . 'The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover is capable of driving to the boxwork layer from its landing site on the floor of Gale Crater and investigating the chemical composition and textures of these deposits from the surface. 'This site is a possible target for investigation by Curiosity as a location where a series of postdepositional water-based processes are interpreted that left extensive exposed diagenetic cements, which are indicative of possibly favorable conditions for preservation of organic compounds.'","Signs of water found 1km up Mount Sharp .

The asteroid, named P/2013 R3, was first spotted by the Catalina and Pan-STARRS sky survey in September . An asteroid breaking up in space has been filmed for the first time. Extraordinary images of the giant rock self-destructing over a period of several months were captured by astronomers. It smashed into ten smaller pieces which will eventually disintegrate into fragments, a few of which will one day reach Earth's atmosphere as meteors and burn up in the sky. Up to 365 metres wide, each with 'tails' caused by dust lifted from their surfaces and pushed back by the pressure of sunlight, they are drifting apart slowly ruling out a spectacular collision with another asteroid. Analysis of the pictures taken by Hubble's Wide-Field Camera 3 suggests the space rock may be spinning fast enough to burst apart. Professor David Jewitt, of the University of California, Los Angeles, said: 'Seeing this rock fall apart before our eyes is pretty amazing.' The crumbling asteroid, named P/2013 R3, was first spotted by the Catalina and Pan-STARRS sky survey telescopes last 15 September and regarded as an unusual, fuzzy looking object. Two weeks later it was spotted by the Keck telescope on Hawaii revealed three bodies moving together embedded in a dusty envelope almost as wide as Earth. Professor Jewitt said: 'The Keck telescope showed us this asteroid was worth looking at with Hubble.' Its superior resolution revealed there were really 10 embedded objects, each with comet-like dust tails. The four largest rocky fragments are up to 365 metres wide. Scroll down for video... The rocky asteroid was one of the innumerable objects populating the crowded asteroid belt located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, roughly three times further away from the sun than Earth. This picture was taken in October 2013 . Scientists do not think the asteroid was destroyed in a collision with another object because the way it is breaking apart. They also think it is unlikely the asteroid fell to pieces due to pressure of interior ice warming. Instead, they said the break-up was probably the result of the effect of sunlight over many years causing the asteroid to spin until it became unstable and ruptured. This phenomenon, known as the YORP effect, has been debated by scientists, but never previously observed. The Hubble data published in Astrophysical Journal Letters found the fragments are drifting away from each other at just a mile an hour - less than walking pace. The asteroid began disintegrating early last year, but new pieces continue to emerge. It is unlikely to have been hit by another asteroid because the impact would have been much more violent. The most likely explanation for its breakup is the effect of sunlight, which increases the rotation rate causing centrifugal force to pull the asteroid apart. This possibility, known as 'YORP torque' has been discussed by scientists for several years but, so far, never reliably observed. The asteroid began disintegrating last year, but new pieces continue to emerge. It's unlikely to have been hit by another asteroid because the impact would have been more violent. Here is it is pictured  on 15 November . The most likely explanation for its breakup is the effect of sunlight, which increases the rotation rate causing centrifugal force to pull the asteroid apart. The the asteroid is pictured on 13 December . For this to happen, P/2013 R3 must have a weak, fractured interior, probably as the result of a number of ancient but non-destructive collisions with other asteroids. Most small asteroids, in fact, are thought to have been severely damaged in this way, giving them a 'rubble pile' internal structure. P/2013 R3 itself is probably the product of collisional shattering of a bigger body some time in the last billion years. The asteroid's remnant debris, weighing in at 200,000 tons, in the future will provide a rich source of meteoroids. Most will eventually plunge into the sun, but a small fraction of the debris may one day enter the Earth's atmosphere to blaze across the sky as meteors. here is is pictured on 14 January . With Hubble's recent discovery of another active asteroid spouting six tails, astronomers are seeing more circumstantial evidence the pressure of sunlight may be the primary force that disintegrates small asteroids less than a mile across in the solar system.

Professor Jewitt co-discovered the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune in 1993. The area, which contains more than a billion objects and was once believed to be empty space, has fundamentally changed the modern perception of the solar system.","The asteroid, named P/2013 R3, broke up over a period of several months .

There were at least six aftershocks in the hours that immediately followed the 6:25 a.m. earthquake, with the largest was a magnitude 2.7 earthquake that struck five miles northwest of Westwood. U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Robert Graves told reporters on Monday morning that there was a possibility that the quake was just a prelude to an equal or stronger one. ‘There’s always the possibility that it’s a foreshock,’ said Graves. About five percent of earthquakes are followed by an equal or larger shake which, if it does happen, typically occurs within the next couple of hours.

Startling: The quake was clearly felt quite strongly in the Hollywood KTLA studios, but no damage was reported . Los Angeles police and fire officials said there were no immediate reports of damage. Broadcasters . live on the air immediately announced that an earthquake was occurring. Anchors at KTLA-TV took cover underneath their desk before quickly . resuming the broadcast by seeking USGS information.

'It . was a definite jolt, just one single jolt and I haven't seen the . magnitude,' said Eric Spillman. 'But it definitely something we could . feel here in downtown.' Seismologists . at the USGS have not yet determined exactly what fault this earthquake . was on and Graves also said ‘we’re continuing to analyze the data, but . at this point, this seems to be what I would call a rather typical . earthquake.’ Exactly what they're supposed to do: When experiencing an earthquake while indoors, experts recommend you get under a desk or table if at all possible. If there is no available desk or table, you should stand against an interior wall . Still rolling: The earth shook for several moments as cameras rolled in the KTLA studio . It was one of the largest to hit Los . Angeles since the 6.7-magnitude Northridge quake killed several dozen . people and caused $25 billion in damage two decades ago, USGS . seismologist Lucy Jones told KABC-TV. 'It's . not that large by California terms. It's the size of earthquake we have . across the state once every couple of months,' Jones said. 'But we . haven't had one like this in LA for quite a while.' The quake was centered 15 miles west-northwest of the downtown civic center and occurred at a depth of about 5 miles. 'It . felt like a bomb going off underneath our house,' said George McQuade, a . West Hills resident. 'Nothing was damaged, but it sure woke everyone . up. It was an eye-opener.' The epicenter was 6 miles from Beverly Hills, 7 miles from Universal City and 7 miles from Santa Monica, the USGS said. Did you feel it?

After 54-years, Federal scientists have said they have recovered one of the last bottle's set adrift by the government to track ocean currents. Keith Moreis discovered the clear glass soda bottle containing a pink sheet that reads 'Break This Bottle' while walking in West Tisbury on Martha's Vineyard on December 22, 2013. The bottle contained a postcard with a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey stamp dated September 19, 1959 with instructions on how to return it to authorities if found. Recovered: This is the bottle found on the beach at Martha's Vineyard that was set adrift in an experiment more than 54-years ago . Keeping the bottle till February 20, Moreis was able to remove the stopper - thereby ensuring that the bottle remained intact. He took it to the Woods Hole Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who explained to Moreis that the bottle was the last of series of bottles released between 1958 and 1966 to chart ocean currents. Drift bottles have been in use to track ocean currents since 1846. 'The postcard had both stamped and handwritten information on the top: U.S.C.&G.S. HYDROGRAPHER was stamped on the left corner, and September 19, 1959 on the right corner, with the day handwritten. 'In the middle, just above the printed words “FINDER OF THIS BOTTLE” and instructions below, was the handwritten number 279B, written twice,' said a report in the Northeast Fisheries Science Center. Experiment: It is probable that it was launched from either the vessel Explorer or Pathfinder in the 1950's or 1960's. It is remarkable that the bottle survived for close to fifty years. Historic: These are the leaflets left inside the bottle set adrift more than 50-years ago in New England . More than 50-years floating: While the NOAA do not know the precise movements of the bottle - they know it was set adrift from Nomans Land in 1959 and washed up at West Tisbury in 2013 . USCGS refers to the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, which was created in 1807 as the Survey of the Coast and expanded as the United State expanded westward. The agency was renamed in 1878 and is currently part of NOAA. Archived documents revealed that in September and October of 1959, the USC&GS Ship Hydrographer conducted environmental studies in three areas off the New England Coast: 16 miles northeast of Cape Cod Light, just south of Nomans Land, and 36 miles south of Gay Head on Martha’s Vineyard. Records from March 1960 indicated that four of the six bottles numbered 279B released south of Nomans Land were recovered within two months of their September 19, 1959 release. Another one after 2 days, another after 4 days, and a third after 7 days. All three were found on Martha’s Vineyard. The fourth was found after 55 days on Nantucket. This means that the December 2013 bottle is one of the last two bottles dropped into the sea from those six. But, just like the others it was recovered near to where it was released - in this case more than 54-years later. 'Finding the bottle was exciting,' Moreis told the Northeast Fisheries Science Center. 'Learning more about it and its history has been a rewarding experience, to say the least. I never expected to find something like this, but then again, you never know what you will find on the beach.'","Bottle set adrift from vessel in New England in September 1959 .

Residents in the quiet New York City suburb of Hastings-on-Hudson are angered about the ostentatious $40million mansion being built in their hamlet by a billionaire hedge fund founder. David E Shaw and his journalist-wife Beth Kobliner purchased three adjoining Hudson-view properties in recent years, and merged them to form an expansive 4.5 acre lot on which to build their 30,000-square-foot modern mansion. As construction wraps up on the home designed by famous architect Steven Holl, residents in the small town aren't too excited to welcome their new neighbors. The village eyesore: Residents of New York City suburb Hastings-on-Hudson are not happy about a new $40million home being constructed in their small town. Above, a picture of the construction site . Getting ready to move in: Construction is nearly finished on the David E Shaw (left) and wife Beth Kobliner's (right) 30,000-square-foot Hastings home . Peter Disolfi, an architect who lives in Hastings, told the New York Times he was 'deeply saddened' that three prewar homes were torn down and replaced by Shaw's mismatched mansion. 'A village is a collection of buildings that relate to each other and to the landscape,' Mr Disolfi, an architecture professor at City College, said. 'Steven Holl is a significant architect and I respect what he does. But it's usually one-off, and relates to itself.' Holl is famous for his futuristic designs, and recently completed Columbia University's new Campbell Sports Center in Manhattan. Contemporary tastes: The couple's home is being designed by architect Steven Voll who recently built Columbia University's new sports complex (above) Plans submitted to the Hastings Building Department prove that the home will indeed stick out like a sore thumb in the town with mostly Tudor and and Colonial-style homes. For starters, the main home will have two dozen sides with a master bedroom shaped like a pentagon. Other features of the estate include the main home's three exercise rooms, a large underground garage, a reading room, an elevator, a pool house, tennis courts and a separate guest house that will cost $7.9million on its own. To put the guest house in context, the most expensive home currently listed in the village has an asking price of $1.3million on less than a quarter of an acre. 'It's totally out of character with what Hastings is all about,' said Mark David, a resident of the town for more than 22 years. The population-8,000 town has become a popular place for young Brooklynites to settle down in recent years, earning it the nickname 'Hipsturbia' in a profile by the Times last year. 'Hipsturbia': The population-8,000 town has become a haven for Brooklynites looking to settle down in the suburbs . Despite their ridiculous wealth, the billionaire couple seem to share certain liberal sensibilities with the townspeople of Hastings. Shaw and his wife are big donors to the Democratic Party. And Shaw, a computer scientist who once taught at Columbia University, serves on President Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Kobliner, a personal finance journalist, also advises the president as a member of the Advisory Council on Financial Capability. But some residents are happy to welcome Shaw, who is worth 3.6billion according to Forbes, for all the tax revenue he will bring in. Shaw will have to pay more than a million dollars a year in property taxes and three quarters of that bill will go to the school district. The average property tax bill in Hastings is $19,000 making Shaw's contribution the equivalent of 50 new houses.","David E Shaw and his journalist-wife Beth Kobliner are building a 30,000-square-foot mansion in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York .

Discount chains Aldi and Lidl have claimed a new scalp following revelations that Sainsbury’s has suffered its first fall in sales for nine years. Same store sales slumped by 3.1per cent in the 10 weeks to March 15 compared to a year ago, which was worse than City analysts expected. The figures are a blow to the reputation of the chief executive Justin King, who is leaving the business later this year and had hoped to maintain his record of success. Sainsbury's saw a 3.1 per cent fall in sales in the 10 weeks to March 15 which was bigger than predicted . Last week, Morrisons signalled a supermarket price war with cuts worth at least £1billion over the next three years in a response to the challenge posed by Aldi and Lidl. Billions of pounds were wiped off the share values of all the leading chains, including Sainsbury’s, amid predictions that they will have to cut prices and profit margins to compete. Sainsbury’s likes to see itself as being a cut above the mainstream supermarkets in terms of quality on its own label ranges which, in theory, justifies higher prices. However, it has been forced to slash the price of milk, bread and eggs in recent days to prevent customers deserting to cheaper rivals. At the same time, a succession of independent taste tests have shown that the quality of own label foods from Aldi and Lidl regularly beats the mainstream supermarkets, including Sainsbury’s. Just last week, Lidl won the own brand range of the year at the Oracle Retail Week Awards, while Aldi was named retailer of the year. Aldi has been blamed in part for the fall, with their own-brand products consistently beating the likes of bigger chains in blind taste tests, with discount store Lidl also putting pressure on established brands . Both the German-owned chains have made a concerted effort to target Middle Britain shoppers with fresh produce, . Aberdeen Angus fillet steaks at £5 each, lobsters, caviar and award-winning wines, coffee and Continental cheeses. Unlike the mainstream supermarkets they have much smaller ranges of each product, whether it is tinned tomatoes or breakfast cereal, which allows them to keep prices down. The boss of Morrisons, Dalton Philips, says that high streets are undergoing the biggest structural change since the 1950s because of the cost of living squeeze and a permanent switch to using budget stores. High street expert, Natalie Berg, Global Research Director, Planet Retail, said Sainsbury’s faces a huge challenge to hang on to customers. ‘Today’s results show that even the darling of the grocery sector is no longer insulated from the discount threat,’ she said. The news will be a blow to Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King who leaves the company this year and will have hoped to continue his run of positive results . ‘Aldi and Lidl are morphing into credible grocery players by expanding their ranges and opening in more attractive locations, placing them in an enviable position when it comes to top-up shopping.’ Lidl, for example, has plans to open a store within 100 yards of Richmond Bridge in south west London, which is one of the wealthiest boroughs in the UK. Mss Berg said: ‘Shoppers don’t want to trawl through 13 varieties of tomatoes and they don’t want to bring a calculator to work out if they’re getting a genuine deal. They want convenience, simplicity of choice and honest prices. ‘The challenge for Sainsbury’s will be regaining lost market share. Once a shopper tries Aldi or Lidl, they tend to stick with them.’ Planet Retail expects sales through discount stores to rise by 64per cent - £8billion – by 2020 to some £20billion a year. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: ‘The march of the discount supermarkets continues to threaten prospects. ‘Last week’s Morrison-induced share price tumble has contributed to a 21per cent decline in the share price over the last six months alone.’ The Sainsbury’s chief executive played down the challenge posed by Aldi and Lidl and the move by Morrisons to reset its prices to a new lower level. Mr King said: ‘The discounters have been around for years - they’re not a new phenomenon.’ He was dismissive of a price war, claiming it was all part of the ‘cut and thrust’ of the market, adding: ‘We should all be pleased with lower prices and in the long run that’s good for the market.’ Sainsbury’s highlighted the value for money of its popular own-brand ranges, claiming they are 20per cent cheaper than branded equivalents. They now make up 51per cent of all products going through tills. It also put faith in its growing clothing ranges, boosted by a collaboration with designer Gok Wan, convenience stores and internet grocery delivery service. Morrisons sparked another price war last week after announcing cuts worth £1billion over three years . Sales through its big box supermarkets are down, however those through convenience outlets are up 15per cent. Experts at Shore Capital Stockbrokers slashed full-year profit forecasts for Sainsbury’s as they said the sales slide was slightly worse than already- downbeat expectations. They said: ‘We will be interested to see how Sainsbury’s approaches the greater discount challenge. Whilst it is not losing out to the same extent as its peers, we do not believe that Sainsbury’s is blind to the challenge.’","Sainsbury's announces fall in sales of 3.1 per cent in 10 weeks to March 15 .

If a grey squirrel is quietly foraging in your garden, you may, unknowingly, have broken the law. Ministers have conceded defeat in the battle against grey by scrapping a little-known piece of legislation which makes it an offence not to alert the authorities if you find one on your land. Enacted in 1937 in an effort to halt the advance of the invasive creature, it attached a stiff penalty of £5 - £295 in today’s money - for failure to ‘give notice to the relevant department’. That way, a man from the ministry could turn up and dispatch the alien grey pest in order to protect the native red squirrel population. There are now fewer than 15,000 red squirrels in England, compared to more than 3 million grey squirrels . Perhaps not surprisingly, the Environment Department (Defra) admits it has not taken any calls in recent years - and with numbers of grey squirrels now in the millions, it now has been announced the law will be taken off the statute books. Groups dedicated to protecting the British red squirrel oppose scrapping the law - saying ministers should not admit defeat in the battle against the grey squirrel. It is some 140 years since wealthy Victorians released the greys, imported from America as a curiosity, onto their estates and unwittingly let them spread like an epidemic across Britain. The grey carries a virus, which does not affect them but kills native red squirrels. There are now just 10,000-15,000 reds in England, (120,000 including Scotland) but around three million greys. Solicitor-General Oliver Heald told a committee of MPs: ‘The order requires occupiers to report the presence of grey squirrels on their land to facilitate the eradication of that species’. ‘However, it is no longer considered feasible to eradicate grey squirrels, so the requirement to report their presence on one’s land is no longer useful or observed...people will no longer be required to report sightings of grey squirrels on their land.’ Solicitor-General Oliver Heald argued for the removal of the law from the statute books . The Grey Squirrels (Prohibition of Importation and Keeping) Order 1937 was proposed by Conservative MP for Lancaster Herwald Ramsbotham who told MPs at the time: ‘There is a very formidable indictment against this animal... The cost of harbouring such an undesirable alien has already been considerable, and is likely to increase, unless we do something about it.’ Janet Wickens of the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, a charity which protects the threatened British variety said she felt ‘uncomfortable’ about scrapping the law. ‘It is nonsense now because who do you report it to, and what do you expect to happen?’, she said. ‘But while I can see the sense of getting rid of it, we said we would prefer it to stay on the books. We didn’t feel comfortable supporting this move because it’s one step closer to accepting an invasive non-native species and giving it the right to live here. ‘If it comes to the point that we are able to reintroduce the red squirrel to certain areas, it would be useful because it would put an onus on landowners to be aware of the need to remove grey squirrels. Once a law is off the statute books, it’s very difficult to get it back on again.’ Chi Onwurah, the Labour MP for Newcastle Central, told Mr Heald: ‘I want the Minister to recognise the fact that red squirrels are still present in Northumberland - I understand that it is the only English county in which there are still red squirrels in significant numbers.’ Yesterday David Bullock, head of nature conservative at the National Trust, said the law had already been superseded by a more recent one - the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 - which lists the grey squirrel as a pest, so it can be culled by someone with a licence and it is illegal to let a captive one loose. Mr Bullock added: ‘They are technically a pest and have to be dispatched, like Muntjac deer and Japanese knotweed. So that’s more powerful than anything from 1937. But in practice we would not expect someone to get rid of one themselves, as grey squirrels bite and spread disease - so it’s best to call the local authority for advice.’","Law was designed to help eradicate grey squirrels .

He told the inquest into his sister’s death yesterday: ‘Buffy was a bit scared but we talked and she calmed down. I told her it would be OK. ‘After a while it became apparent we could not keep being battered by the waves. ‘We had a mobile phone with us in a waterproof bag so we tried to dial 999 but there was no reception. We looked to swim out of the cave but every time we saw an opportunity another big wave came crashing in. ‘It appeared the only option was for one of us to swim outside to get help. ‘I decided to swim out of the cave.

Her body has never been recovered. Mr Furness-Smith was plucked out of the sea by a coastguard helicopter at 3pm on November 2 last year, while a lifeboat crew tried to reach the entrance to  the cave but was beaten back by the waves. Andrew Bugler, station officer for St Albans Coastguard, was part of the team who attempted the rescue. Rescue attempt: Her brother, Alex, left her trapped in the cave while he called for the Coastguard. They rushed to the scene, but could not save her in time . He said: ‘They were shouting down every three to four minutes. I could hear her screaming back, “Get me out of here”. She sounded terrified.’ Russell Thompson, an expert in coasteering who runs guided tours along the Dorset coast, told the inquest that conditions on November 2 were too dangerous to consider going in the water. He said: ‘We would have never have even thought about getting into the water that day.’ Miss Furness-Smith, a maths teacher from Bristol, had travelled to the Dorset coast with her brother to go kite-surfing but it was too windy so they decided to go coasteering at Tilly Whim Caves near Swanage. They put on wetsuits, buoyancy aids and helmets before clambering down the cliff onto a ledge and jumped in at 1.30pm. As they swam past the cave entrance they were hit by a 15ft sea swell whipped up by gale-force winds and were swept into it. Charlotte Furness-Smith's mother, Patricia, arrived at Bournemouth Coroner's Court to hear the evidence .

They appeared to be unhappy that certain witnesses they wanted to ask questions of were not at the inquest, although it was not made clear who they were referring to. The inquest continues. Aftermath: In the hours after the horrifying incident, rescuers had to retrieve her body from the tiny inlet. Today, Alex, 31, told an inquest she screamed for help while she was trapped in the small cave . Tide: A lifeboat crew tried to reach the 5ft entrance to the cave but was beaten back by the waves.

A former Florida mayor is accused of major tax evasion and newly unsealed documents revealed Monday that the politician, whose wife is facing charges along with him, allegedly used illicit funds to keep a mistress. Julio Robaina was once top dog at the city of Hialeah, Florida's sixth largest, but now faces possible jail time in part for allegedly loaning his convicted Ponzi schemer friend $850,000 and then taking over $300,000 in secret cash interest payments with no cut for Uncle Sam. And no cut for his wife Raiza Villacis-Robaina, it appears, though she's remained by her husband's side nonetheless. She stayed with him: The ex-mayor of one of Florida's biggest cities, Hialeah in Miami-Dade County, is on trial with his wife for alleged tax evasion. But Julio Robaina, left, may have been hiding money from his wife Raize Villacis Robaina (right) in order to pay to keep a mistress . It's just part of what prosecutors say was over $1 million in 'shadow banking' profits delivered to Robaina. And while the state attorneys have urged Villacis-Robaina-- who they don't believe was a direct recipient of the untaxed cash--to get her own attorney, she has refused. Which comes as a surprise after the Miami Herald revealed Monday that Robaina was spending the money on a mistress and needed to keep it below board so his wife wouldn't find out. 'The government expects its evidence to show that the cash interest payments were delivered to defendant Julio Robaina, rather than defendant Raiza Robaina,' read the newly unsealed documents. Dirt deeds? Robaina and his wife are accused of hiding $1 million from the government. Documents unsealed Monday reveal Robaina is accused of taking cash from his debtors in order to keep a mistress and hide it from his wife . This fresh twist in the Robaina's saga revolves around their alleged involvement with Luis Felipe Perez, who's now serving 10 years after pleading guilty to running a $45 million jewelry investment Ponzi scheme. According to the Herald, prosecutors say Perez agreed to pay the couple 18 percent interest on over $850,000. But they say the arrangement was with he former mayor and not his wife, because the $300,000 or so he made from Perez helped him keep an unnamed mistress on the side. Meanwhile, it's Mrs. Villacis-Robaina who'll be standing alonside her husband at the April 10 trial. 'We feel an obligation to notify the court and defense counsel of this difference between the two defendants,' the prosecutor said in a closed-door hearing in February. Despite urgings from the prosecutors over her conflict of interest, Villacis-Robaina continues to retain the same attorney as her husband in the case. Meanwhile, the alleged dealings with Perez aren't the only misdeeds the couple is accused of. The May 2013 indictment alleges that Robaina and his wife avoided paying their full share of taxes and instead used the money to purchase two Miami beach condominiums and a Ferrari sports car. The Newark, New Jersey-born Robaina, a Republican, was first elected mayor of Hialeah in 2005 and elected to a second term in 2009. He stepped down in 2011 to launch a losing bid for mayor of Miami-Dade County, a year after the IRS had begun investigating his personal finances. Hialeah, a blue-collar and predominantly Cuban-American district, is better known for its ubiquitous warehouses than for its once regal Hialeah Park race track. One of Florida's biggest cities, it has a long history of graft and corruption and former Mayor Henry Milander, who died in office in 1974 after 27 years in power, survived numerous scandals, including a grand larceny conviction. More recently, in the 1980s and '90s, Cuban-born Raul Martinez, a longtime Hialeah mayor, won re-election despite a federal influence-peddling indictment and two hung juries.","Prosecutors allege former Hialeah, Florida mayor Julio Robaina accepted some $300,000 under the table from his now-jailed friend Luis Felipe .

Convert: Rebekah Dawson, 22, who refused to remove her niqab full face veil in court has been jailed for a further six months . A Muslim convert who refused to remove her niqab in court was jailed for six months today after she terrorised a mosque security guard because he allowed non-Muslim women inside without veils. Last week Rebekah Dawson, 22, was sentenced to 20 months at the Old Bailey for making three videos glorifying the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby while her husband Royal Barnes, 23, was jailed for five years and four months. However, today she was sentenced to a further six months after admitting to threatening and intimidating Daudi Yusuf at Finsbury Park Mosque in north London. Dawson . had initially denied a single charge of intimidating a witness but, in a bizarre twist, changed her . plea to guilty in January after the jury failed to reach a verdict . against her and her brother Matthias Dawson, 32. She had tried to stop Mr Yusuf from testifying against Barnes, who had assaulted him. Barnes had angrily confronted Mr Yusuf after they took offence when he let three Portuguese women tourists tour the mosque without wearing headscarves on June 10 last year. She later returned to Mr Yusuf’s office and confronted him about . letting non-Muslims into the mosque asking him 'Why are you inviting . naked women in the mosque.' Dawson then ran off and her husband attacked Mr Yusuf who then reported it to the police. Two weeks later, on June 23, Dawson returned to the mosque in an attempt to stop Mr Yusuf from giving evidence. She told the frightened security guard: ‘Now I’ve seen your face you’re finished - you’re not safe’. Barnes was found guilty of assault and harassment at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in December 2013. Mr Yusuf said he was left feeling 'worried' about another attack because he did not know what Dawson looked like due to her having her face covered. A defence statement previously made to the court said: 'She attended on June 23 to ask him why he was lying. Row: Dawson admitted to threatening and intimidating Daudi Yusuf at Finsbury Park Mosque in north London in a row over non-Muslim women being allowed inside without wearing veils . 'She did not threaten him or do anything to interfere with him being a witness in other proceedings.' During her trial Dawson had to remove her veil for a female police officer who then verified that she was the defendant at the start of every court session. During her trial at Blackfriars Crown Court she refused to remove her niqab - which leaves only the eyes on show. She claimed her religion prevented her . removing the veil in the presence of men but Judge Peter Murphy ruled . it was of ‘cardinal importance’ that a jury could see her face while she . gave evidence. In his . original ruling Judge Murphy said that Dawson could not expect the court . to ‘set aside its established procedure’ to accommodate a ‘particular . religious practice’. Write caption here . Video nasty: Barnes was filmed by his wife laughing hysterically as he drove past the scene of the attack near Woolwich Barracks last May . Susan Meek, defending, today told the court that Dawson, of Stroud Green, north London, has suffered ‘great intrusion into her life’ due to ‘unprecedented media interest’ for her wearing of the niqab. She also said that Dawson’s dreams of becoming an English . teacher were now in “tatters” and that she wanted to get on with her . life being a law abiding citizen. But Judge Murphy said the court must show that witness intimidation was not acceptable. Shocking: In the video clips Barnes described the day Fusilier Lee Rigby (pictured) was murdered as 'brilliant' He . said: 'I have given a great deal of thought to this case. Mr Daudi . Yusuf was doing his job. Obviously there was a difference of opinion but . it did not justify the offence committed against him.' The . judge jailed Dawson for an extra six months for intimidating Mr Yusuf, . to run consecutively to her current term of imprisonment, and also . handed her a five-year restraining order banning her  from contacting Mr . Yusuf, going within 500 meters of Finsbury Park . Mosque and from entering the Muslim Welfare Centre.. 'Your . brother said that your husband Royal Barnes had changed your life . considerably for the worse - I’m sure you don’t agree with that', he . said. 'I have to say I find . his evidence compelling and whether you wish me to or not I’m going to . take into account my own belief that this offence was committed by you . at least partly under your husband’s influence.' He added: 'It was not a systematic campaign but took place on one occasion and no . violence was used but the threats were obviously very real.' Dawson, who refused to stand in court, bowed her head as she received her latest prison sentence. Last week Dawson and her husband were jailed at the Old Bailey after she filmed Barnes - a Muslim extremist with links to one of Lee Rigby's killers Michael Adebowale - as . he glorified the Woolwich killing in a series of YouTube videos. Barnes was filmed by his veiled wife laughing hysterically as he drove past the scene of the attack near Woolwich Barracks last May. The couple ridiculed the memorial flowers left by friends, family, and members of the public for Drummer Rigby and Barnes described the murder as ‘absolutely brilliant’ on videos uploaded on to YouTube. In the clip shot as the pair drove close to tributes left to Drummer Rigby, Dawson asked her husband to drive around again as he said: 'These kuffar, they fail to realise . that their foreign policy is the reason why this Lee Rigby is no . more...he got chopped up in Woolwich...'

'The vast majority of . city-centre residents have no garden and live in purpose-built or converted . flats. For them, public parks are the only open space they have access to.

'No person shall, after being . requested to desist by any other person in the ground, make or permit to be . made any noise which is continuous or repeated.' The proposals would also ban . skateboarding deemed to 'cause danger or give reasonable grounds for . annoyance'. Bristol City Council and the . police received more than 3,000 complaints about anti-social behaviour in open . spaces over the last two years. Park: Any child or adult caught breaking the law in Brandon Hill Park could be fined £500 . The fines would be dished out . by police officers, PCSOs and dog wardens and have come about after a public . consultation of almost 1,000 people.

Clubbers fell through the floor after the toilet collapsed in a Salford nightclub, which miraculously didn't leave anyone injured . Greater Manchester Police attended the incident and a building control officer was called to secure the scene and investigate.

A man who dragged a cardboard cut-out of a policeman onto a petrol station forecourt and kicked it to pieces in full view of CCTV has been fined £90. Police tracked down the 23-year-old after the bizarre attack at a Tesco petrol station in Pitsea, Essex, where the two-dimensional officer was supposedly being used to deter shoplifters. They used his car numberplate to trace him to his home in nearby Basildon and issued him with the fine for criminal damage. Lifelike: A 23-year-old man has been fined for kicking a cardboard policeman similar to the one pictured . Crime fighters: The £100 cut-outs were introduced in a trial by Essex police in 2009 and scrapped the next year. Some have since been reintroduced. Pictured left: PCSOs Helen Calver and Sgt Steve Scott (file photo) Police viewed footage of the incident, which happened in broad daylight on March 1, and attended the man's home on Tuesday last week where he admitted the attack. Sgt Simon Gray, . from the Basildon Retail Crime Unit, said: 'This man obviously thought . it would be funny to take this cut-out to the forecourt and kick it to . pieces. Essex Police spent £760 on eight so-called 'cardboard cops' for a trial in 2009, where they were put at petrol stations to deter fuel thieves. The trial was abandoned a year later after the force admitted they were not having the desired effect - and some were being stolen. Amid headlines the force removed the effigies from forecourts, shops and supermarkets. But the two-dimensional crime fighters were recently reintroduced at supermarkets and petrol stations around Basildon, paid for jointly by Basildon Council and Essex Police. The destroyed cardboard policeman has not yet been replaced at the Tesco petrol station. It is not the first bizarre crime at the Pitsea branch of Tesco. Last August, a brazen thief stole a Thomas the Tank Engine children's ride from outside the shop in broad daylight. 'Whatever he may have thought, this cutout was there for a reason. 'We did manage to track down this man using CCTV and he was dealt with by way of a £90 fine.' Essex Police would not name the man because he was not charged with a criminal offence. Fixed penalty notices are used to punish low-level crime to avoid giving an offender a criminal record. For criminal damage cases, a fixed penalty notice can be given at an . officer's discretion if the value of the damage was less than £300 and . the victim knows they will not receive compensation. Essex Police introduced the cardboard crime fighters in a 2009 trial supposedly to deter shoplifters. But some of the £100 life-size cut-outs became victims of crime themselves, being stolen by pranksters, youths or criminals. The official trial was scrapped in 2010 with police in Essex admitting the cardboard figures failed to reduce crime. But new cut-outs were funded recently by the local Retail Crime Unit, which works in partnership with the council. They . have been used in several areas including Berkshire, Hull and Gwent, . where the Welsh force alone spent £13,260 in two years on 52 cutouts . costing £255 each. Sgt Gray added: 'These cardboard cut-outs have received some bad press in the past. 'We do not use them to replace officers, instead they are a tool that we use to deter shoplifters. 'We have seen a reduction in shoplifting offences at the stores where these cut outs are located.' Crime scene: The attack was caught on CCTV at this Tesco petrol station in Pitsea, Essex .

A school reunion had to be broken up by police after former pupils started scrawling graffiti on the walls and smoking in the toilets. Orwell High School in Felixstowe, Suffolk, last night held an event for alumni before it is due to close next month. But the party spiralled out of control when attendees - some in their 40s and 50s - began vandalising the building. The school blamed a 'small minority' of the visitors for the damage, which prompted a clean-up operation this morning. Carnage: A reunion at Orwell High School in Felixstowe had to be shut down thanks to ex-pupils' behaviour . The former pupils repeatedly set off the fire alarm when they refused to stop smoking in the toilets while drunk. They also drew lewd pictures on the wall, and damaged current students' work which was on display. After police and firefighters were called to the scene, the revellers were told to go home early. Former pupil Jaimielee Rendall, who left the school in 2005, said: 'I've heard various stories that people were walking around drunk and didn't know what they were doing. 'A few of the walls had graffiti on them, which is a shame because children now have to go to school this morning with their school emblazoned with graffiti. It's sad it got out of control.' The school is set to merge with the nearby Deben High School to create Felixstowe Academy. A similar reunion set to take place at Deben High was cancelled after the carnage at Orwell. A spokesman for the academy said: 'Unfortunately the evening had to be brought to a close earlier than planned due to health and safety concerns. 'Sadly a very small minority of adult visitors took it upon themselves to smoke within the building and write graffiti on the walls, causing vandalism to an operating school.' Police said they were first called to the school to respond to issues over parking, but are now hoping to interview one of the visitors on suspicion of criminal damage.","Orwell High School in Felixstowe held a party because it is set to close .

But that didn't stop 17 teenagers from Cheltenham Girls High in Sydney from shaving off their hair this morning - all in the name of charity. And as if the task wasn't daunting enough - they even signed up to complete the challenge live on television, raising more than $30,000 (£16,480) for the Leukaemia Foundation. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Brave: 17 students from Cheltenham Girls shaved off their hair on live TV and raised more than $30,000 for the Leukaemia Foundation . Lifesavers: The money raised from this fundraising event will help people with blood cancer, Australia's second most common cause of cancer-related deaths . A Channel 9 spokeswoman said one of the girls burst into tears during the shave and had to be consoled by her parents afterwards. 'We actually had more of the parents crying than the girls themselves,' she said. The annual World's Greatest Shave raises money for people with blood cancer. Blood cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in Australia, with one person losing their life every two hours from the disease. Mornings host Sonia Kruger said all the girls were extremely brave for raising funds and awareness in this way. When Kruger asked 14-year-old Angela Tung if she was nervous about having her hair shaved off, she replied: 'Yeah a little bit, but there are plus sides so it's OK.' Those said advantages included not accidentally getting her hair in her mouth anymore. Kruger was then coerced by her co-host David Campbell to pick up the scissors and cut Angela's hair. 'There's so much hair!' she exclaimed, before handing the student her ponytail. All in the name of charity: The girls and their principal posed with Mornings host Sonia Kruger and David Campbell after completing the shave . The teenager said the process was a lot easier knowing she had so much support around her. 'When I walked into class this morning everyone stood up and started clapping and cheering. It was really nice,' Angela said. 'Quite a few people have said it looks really good and hopefully I've inspired a few others to do the same next year because it's such a great cause.' Angela alone raised $3,000 - well over what she was expecting from her family and friends.. 'I was expecting a couple hundred at the most,' she said. 'Dad's workmates all chipped in so it was good.' Cheltenham Girls High principal Susan Bridge said she was very proud of her students.

'They are so brave and they are so strong,' she said. 'They're such wonderful young women and they are doing it for such a wonderful cause. All of the girls have volunteered to have this done today in order to raise money for the Leukaemia Foundation. Before going on air, the girls had raised $28,000 between them until Campbell announced Mornings and Boost Media would kick in an additional $2000.

Next time someone criticises you for playing too much Candy Crush, you can tell them you’re actually solving a complex mathematical problem. Australian researcher Toby Walsh wanted to test whether the game was what’s called NP-hard - or difficult to solve without a computer. To test this theory, he constructed a theoretical board of candies and was able to turn it into a logical math puzzle - meaning the strategy could be classified alongside other complex problems, confirming it is NP. Scroll down for video . Australian Toby Walsh wanted to test whether Candy Crush was NP-complete, or difficult to solve without a computer. To test this theory, he constructed a theoretical board of candies and turned it into a logic puzzle. The high number of possible outcomes he uncovered proves the games complexity . Put simply, if a starting board of . candies has two instances where a row of three can be made, the player . has to decide which row to complete first. Once they have selected this row, it sets off a chain reaction and directly influences which candies fall where as the game continues. Once . the game is solved, the player would need to start again, but this time . choose the other row option, to determine which route scored the highest . points. To make an . informed, mathematical decision about which row to choose, however, . requires knowing what candies will appear once the row has been . completed. Each time candies fall, they create a number of new row options, increasing the number of possible outcomes. To . check the best score, the player would have to go back over each . possible outcome, and the rows that follow - producing a puzzle that . can’t be solved manually. Candy Crush Saga is a hugely popular game in which players move different coloured candies around a board to create lines of three in a row. Once a line of three matching candies is completed, they disappear and candies drop from the top of the screen to fill the gaps. Early rounds involve making a number of swaps in a set timeframe, or to achieve a minimum score. Due to the large number of variables, Toby Walsh from NICTA and University of New South Wales, wanted to see whether the game was a P math problem, or an NP problem. P problems are puzzles that are easy to solve, while NP problems are much more difficult and can only be solved by a computer because of the large amount of data produced. To test this theory, Walsh constructed a theoretical board of candies, in which the size of the board was unrestricted. He then tested whether it was possible to create a sequence of swaps (k) that obtained a specific score (s). If a board of candies has two instances where a row of three can be made, the player has to decide which row to complete first. This sets off a chain reaction and directly influences future moves. Once the game is solved, the player must start again numerous times to try all the possible swap options . This turned the game into a mathematical problem. In the process of trying to solve this formula, Walsh concluded the variables and possible outcomes for each level were so high only a computer would be able to process the information – making the puzzle not only NP, but NP-complete. NP-complete puzzles have solutions that can be applied to all other NP problems, but finding that one solution is difficult. For example, if Walsh found the solution to the Candy Crush problem, in theory, this same solution could be applied to other puzzles with large number of variables and outcomes. The same strategy was also used to prove games including Super Mario Brothers and Zelda are also NP-hard. 'Part of its addictiveness may be that Candy Crush is a computationally hard puzzle to solve,' concluded Walsh.","Candy Crush Saga involves swapping candies to make rows of three .

A police force has been criticised for sending an officer dressed in a fluffy taxpayer-funded wolf costume to try and break into homes as part of a security campaign. Badsey the Wolf was deployed by Suffolk Police to patrol the streets of the Babergh area and shock villagers into realising how easy it would be for a thief to break into a home or car. However, out of the 92 properties visited by the character in Long Melford and Lavenham he was able to break into just a handful, including one shed - where Badsey posed with the owner's fishing rod which had been left inside. Outfit: Suffolk Police sent an officer dressed in a fluffy Badsey the Wolf costume to try to break into homes and cats for a security campaign . Fishing for trouble: Badsey posed up with fishing equipment left inside the owner's unlocked shed . And the campaign was criticised by locals who took to the Force's Facebook page to ask why resources were not being put into increasing police patrols in the area. 'No amount of ""securing"" cannot be undone by readily available . tools, bolt croppers and portable disc cutters are both very cheap,' wrote Kyle Smith. 'We . need police, on patrol at night, and perhaps some streetlights again?' Alexander Mednick added: 'The issue isn't that people don't secure their . sheds.

Kevin Seggie asked: 'There are no police on the beat, crimes are being . committed on a regular basis in the same areas, why on earth don't the police patrol these areas?' And Martin Sawyer said: 'Is our police force policing Suffolk or a Kindergarten?' Badsey was first introduced in September last year as part of a crime prevention took to highlight insecurities in areas hit by break-ins.

Over the course of two days, Tuesday, January 28 and Wednesday, February 5, police in Babergh visited a total of 92 homes to highlight insecurities in people's homes and vehicles. Some 40 properties were visited in Laverham, including the unlocked shed where the fishing equipment was discovered. Keys to a property were also found left in an insecure utitlity room, and at another home keys could be seen in the inside lock of a back door. In Long Melford officers visited 52 properties where they found windows open at houses with no one at home and insecure garden gates leading to concealed gardens and outbuildings. Fourteen vehicles were also checked, but these were all were found to be secure. 'Suffolk Police take burglary very serious as we know the devastating effect it can have on people and the feelings of violation that it can leave behind,' said a police spokesman. Cop in wolf's clothing: A member of the local Safer Neighbourhood Team, either a police officer or police community support officer will wear the Badsey outfit . 'With this in mind we will do whatever we can to stop people from becoming a victim. 'Badsey the Wolf is a crime prevention tool used to raise awareness among residents of how leaving your property insecure can make it all too easy for a thief to enter. Since the initiative began we have visited over 130 properties and are sure that residents would prefer a police officer enter their home than a burglar. 'Despite our best efforts in the past to highlight the dangers of leaving property insecure it still occurs throughout the county and therefore we have to come up with new ways of raising awareness. If the initiative is now gaining media interest we would suggest it is working. 'Officers will always knock on the door of a property first and await a response. If there is no response then a uniformed officer will try the door to see if it is insecure. If this is the case they will enter, make sure no one is inside of the property before leaving a leaflet to explain that we have been and why.' The spokesman added that there were no immediate plans for Badsey to make a return. 'I don't think there are any plans at the moment, we do it if we have a particular spate of burglaries,' she said.","Badsey sent to homes to show how easy it would be for a thief to break in .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:49 EST, 7 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:38 EST, 7 March 2014 . The dating app Tinder has come under fire over a ‘slut-shaming’ safe sex ad that is appearing in fictitious female profiles. The campaign, created by the AIDS Task Force, suggests to male users that they may catch an STD from hooking up with female Tinder users with the tagline: 'You're probably not her only match. Use a condom.' Responses to the ad have been vitriolic, with Twitter users calling it ‘disgusting’. The campaign: Tinder has been accused of slut-shaming for a campaign created by the AIDS Task Force . One, Hayley Burrows wrote: 'This actually makes me sick.’ Another, . Elise Garofalo, responded: ‘Two steps forward, one step back...’ and . Audrey Blake, said that ‘slut-shaming just needs to stop.’ According . to a video about the campaign, published by the Israeli advertising . firm behind it, GREAT Interactive, Tinder's male users reach the message . through fake female profiles. Each shows photos of an attractive woman . posing suggestively alongside multiple partners. The last photo in the fictitious profile’s slideshow reveals the app's controversial message. A . representative for Tinder told MailOnline that it was ‘not involved . with this AIDS project in any way’ – and indeed it does seem that the app . is simply being used as a platform for the AIDS Task Force message. The . Daily Dot, which initially noticed the ad, argues that the AIDS Task . Force campaign is still effective, despite the anger surrounding it. ‘To . be fair, the campaign is clever—what better way to spread a positive . social message than to broadcast it on an app used by millions every . day?’ writes reporter EJ Dickson. ‘And it’s never a bad idea to advocate . for safer sex practices, especially on a platform that’s implicitly, if . not explicitly, used primarily to find casual sex partners.’ Tagline: The campaign has been named The Tinder AIDS Project, but Tinder has denied involvement in its creation . How it works: The app has installed multiple fake profiles that feature attractive people posing with multiple partners of the opposite sex, telling men to use protection to protect against STDs . The site concurs with critics, however, that the ‘social message is compromised by blatant slut-shaming.’ But . while GREAT Interactive’s video tells us that ‘having a one-night-stand . has never been easier,’ Tinder’s 27-year-old creator insists otherwise. Justin Mateen told the Huffington Post in December that Tinder isn’t a hook-up app, ‘because women aren’t wired that way.’ Tinder . does not reveal how many users it has, but recently disclosed that it . facilitates around 750million profile ratings per day, leading to more . than 5million matches.

Then the new Insanity classes rolling out across British gyms could be for you. The hardcore American workout practised by Demi Lovato is focussed on high-intensity interval training (HIIT). She famously tweeted: 'Just did the #Insanity workout DVD... Amazing.. So intense but I loved it!' Insanity is usually practiced at home on DVD, but for British gym bunnies lacking discipline,  a 45-minute gym class has launched where you're put through your paces with the promise of a possible 1,000-calorie burn. To put that into perspective, a spinning class burns just 331 in the same amount of time. Group Exercise manager at the Reebok Sports Club, Tanya Camilleri, demonstrates from acrobatics . The cardio-based, total-body conditioning programme and is based on 'max . interval training', supposedly a faster way of burning calories. Traditional . HIIT workouts, which can burn up to 750 calories in 45 minutes, feature short . bursts of maximum intensity with longer periods of . rest. But Insanity flips that formula upside-down by combining . lengthier periods of high intensity exercise with shorter cool downs. And now, developers Beachbody have . taken the principles of the successful Insanity home DVD to create the . 'ultimate HIIT class', available at select gyms across Britain including . the swanky Reebok Sports Club and thirtysevendegrees Olympia, from April onwards. Taking place in studios with an instructor, the equipment-free classes involve non-stop strenuous stamina training and claim to improve fitness in 60 days, if practiced weekly. Insanity classes target the entire . body, beginning with an accelerated warmup and moving into three intense . blocks of work, each one targeting a different element of fitness. First is plyometrics and endurance - . essentially 'jump training' where muscles exert maximum force in as . short a time as possible. Then the class moves on to strength and . balance before the final section on agility and co-ordination. You . finish with eight minutes of functional core work and a stretch. I headed to the Reebok gym full of enthusiasm after having recently vowing to start working out three times a week to improve my fitness. I'd heard it was one of the hardest workouts out there and although I was a little intimidated, I was keen to get stuck in. Once we got going I found it very hard and very quick. The moves were faster than any speed I'm comfortable moving at (a bit like when Spinning instructors tell you to sprint when you're knackered). Lots of floor work, burpees, jumps, lunges - everything in max-impact mode. No easing you in. I found myself slipping over once in a while and also taking the low-impact option on a few occasions. Everyone else in the class, though, was committed to the workout and pushed themselves to the max. The class was held in a giant gleaming studio and once we got going I found it very jumpy and quick . After the shakes and exhaustion surpassed, the workout was ultimately satisfying. If I kept it up, I could surely get up to the level of my fellow gym-goers. As long as your health is good don't be afraid to push yourself for real results. An instructor will always ask if you have any injuries and advise on low-impact variations to suit, but, generally, we can achieve more than we think we're capable of, and Insanity's the proof. At least in the gym. Would I go back? Were I a member of Reebok, yes, for sure. I'd do this once a week as I think variety is key, and this class seems like a golden addition to any fitness regime. That bit you dread but the push you need. DENI KIRKOVA . Participants work out at the very limits of their capability for three to four minute bursts of intense, dynamic exercises, which are spaced with rests or 'cools down' for . about 30 seconds, before the whole process is repeated. Instructors provide low-impact options for each move so the class is accessible to all fitness levels. Watch full video on YouTube here. 'Adding high-intensity exercise . forces the body to use fast-twitch muscle fibers not normally engaged in . cardio exercise,' explains a spokesperson for Insanity. 'These . fast-twitch fibers continue burning fuel even during lower-intensity . exercise. Insanity's high-intensity activity forces the body to work for . longer periods of time at a higher capacity than traditional workouts. 'People experience faster . increases in cardiovascular fitness, and burn carbohydrates and fat . more efficiently - as much as 1,000 calories per hour, with the enhanced . calorie burn lasting anywhere from three to 24 hours after completion of the . workout.' As a result, the workout, developed by personal trainer Shaun T. in 2009, claims to be the most effective workout programmes around.

David McGowan, 28, from Cottingham, near Hull, set up a fake profile in Rebecca Millward’s name on a 'hook-up' website and directed strangers wanting a casual fling to turn up at her home in Brighton unannounced. He used photographs he'd taken of the 25-year-old nurse during their relationship to create the profile before, pretending to be her, sending out her address inviting men to her flat. David McGowan, 28, posed as his ex, Rebecca Millward, 25, on casual sex websites and invited men to her flat . Miss Millward told Beverley Magistrates' Court she became too 'scared' to answer the door, and worried that the photographs of her would be found by colleagues and patients. In a statement read out in court, Miss Millward said: 'I am worried about the photos that were put on the website. 'I have just qualified as a nurse, and I am worried patients and colleagues can see them and that it looks unprofessional. 'Whenever the phone goes or someone knocks on my door during the day, I worry.  When men were arriving at my home, I felt unsafe, and I don’t want to be home alone.' The court heard that Miss Millward ended the nine-month, long-distance relationship with McGowan last September. On New Year’s Eve, McGowan, a consultant in the asbestos industry, was given a harassment order after bombarding her with emails, texts and Facebook messages, and received a police caution for setting up a fake profile on the 'hook-up' site.

He said McGowan, who got rid of the profile by contacting the website, could not remember sending the email, believed he was drunk when he did so, and that Miss Millward did not answer the Skype call.

With its castellated turrets, grey stone ramparts and sweeping views over the grounds, Bellister Castle is without doubt a desirable residence. And this imposing seven-bedroom pile can be yours if you have £1,750 a month to spend on renting a home - the same amount as it would cost to rent a small terraced house in south London. Let's just hope the previous tenants take their washing in before the new ones move in. Bellister Castle can be yours for the same rent as a two-bedroomed terraced house in south London . Ancient ruins: The castle is attached to a 14th century tower - just the spot for your rotary clothes dryer . Standing on raised ground overlooking the South Tyne Valley in Northumberland, Bellister Castle was built in the 19th century and therefore boasts more modern comforts than the 14th century ruins it is attached to. Owned by the National Trust since 1976, it is available to rent for a 10-year period, and compared to what the same figure buys you in London, tenants will get a lot for their money. The castle, which lies just outside the village of Haltwhistle, is approached along a tree-lined drive and is surrounded by mature grounds including a walled garden, lawns, stables and an orchard. With grand reception rooms featuring wood-burning stoves and intricate ceiling mouldings, the castle has a wide oak staircase leading up to seven bedrooms, three bathrooms and an additional attic room. There is also a grand piano which the previous tenants are offering for sale. Not all of the current inhabitants are moving out, however.  Bellister Castle is said to be haunted by the 'Grey Man', the ghost of a minstrel who, having been unjustly accused of being a spy was savaged to death by hounds as he fled the castle. With its grand stone fireplaces, wooden floors and oak staircase, Bellister Castle offers space and history . The castle, which dates back to 1669 and was remodelled in the 19th century, is attached to 14th century ruins . The Northumbrian castle boasts intricate ceiling mouldings, open fires and grand reception rooms . Bellister Castle in Northumberland boasts seven bedrooms and a ghost, and is to let for £1,750 a month . The property is part of the Bellister Estate, which was owned by Robert de Ros and his descendants form 1191 to 1295. The castle is attached to the ruins of his property, and dates back to 1669, though it was substantially remodelled by famous Newcastle architect John Dobson in 1841. Julia Curry, rural surveyor for the National Trust said: 'Bellister Castle is one of the most unique places we let out to residential tenants and offers an exciting opportunity for somebody.

Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers executive director Richard Masten was ordered Friday to hand an anonymous tip about a drug suspect over to the court but instead gobbled it down – and now he faces up to two weeks in jail for being in contempt of court. Masten told NBC Miami he snacked on the paper instead of handing it over because doing so would reveal the name of a source. Crime Stoppers organizations around the country are able to collect tips due to promised anonymity. Snack time: Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers executive director Richard Masten ate a tip sheet instead of handing it over to the court . Back for seconds: He then crumpled up another sheet and ate that one as well . ‘We promise the people who give us information to solve murders, serious violent crimes in this community [and] nothing about them or their information would ever be compromised,’ he told the station outside the courtroom. Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers has received tens of thousands of tips that have led to thousands of arrests since its 1983 inception, the station noted. ‘The case today started creeping into that... it’s not going to happen on my watch and I understood the consequences,’ he added. The judge ordered him to share the tip in a case where a woman was charged with cocaine possession after her defense attorney asked to see it. Not on my watch: Masten said outside the courtroom that handing the sheet over would set a dangerous precedent . Delicious: Masten gobbled down a paper similar to this one . The attorney insisted he had no intention of revealing the source’s name. ‘There’s absolutely no information that I am looking for that has to do with the name or the identity of a tipster,’ lawyer Jean-Michel D’Escoubet said. ‘It's only the evidence that would be used in trial against her that the tip provided.’ Masten argued that handing over the tip sheet would set a bad precedent. ‘If you do it in this case, the question comes down the road, well you did it in that case why not this case,’ he said. ‘Well, I’m not going to do it in this case.’ Masten was immediately found in contempt of court and ordered to return this week for sentencing, but he said he’d be ready. ‘I’ll bring a toothbrush and some pajamas in case I do.’","Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers executive director Richard Masten ate an anonymous tip sheet instead of agreeing to an order to hand it over .

"By . Jimmy Perry . PUBLISHED: . 20:51 EST, 17 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 05:51 EST, 18 March 2014 . Here’s a funny thing, though it might not make you laugh. Dad’s Army, the show I created and co-wrote with David Croft, is repeated every Saturday and gets audiences of 2.2 million. But my favourite sitcom of all, the one that recaptures the most extraordinary era of my life, will never be screened again. Classic: The It Ain't Half Hot Mum cast with Michael Bates in make-up as Rangi, centre front . It Ain’t Half Hot Mum has been deemed by the BBC too politically incorrect and even racist to be repeated. I believe it’s equally as funny as Dad’s Army, and full of characters just as memorable — the blustering sergeant-major, the camp drag artiste and the Indian orderly who was more British than the Brits. The comedy — about a Royal Artillery concert party stationed in India in the last months of World War II — was ribald and often farcical, but anyone who has served in the Armed Forces knows that is exactly what it’s like. Like all the shows David Croft and I wrote together — including Hi-de-Hi!, set in a Fifties holiday camp, and the upstairs downstairs comedy You Rang, M’Lord? — this was deeply rooted in reality. And that’s the problem. Too many executives at the BBC have rather too little idea what reality looks like. They are Oxbridge graduates trained by other Oxbridge graduates who learnt what they know from still more Oxbridge graduates. The real world doesn’t get a look-in at today’s BBC. I’m 90 and my generation, by contrast, had about as much reality as anyone could wish for. During World War II, I joined the Home Guard: it was 1941 and I was the 16-year-old original of Private Pike. Two years later, I was conscripted into the Royal Artillery as a gunner. In 1944, I was sent to Burma, where I spent four months manning a gun battery, before I was sent to Deolali, near Mumbai, and joined the concert party. We didn’t call it Deolali in those days — it was Doolally! Like the characters in our sitcom, I was a gunner, and the standing joke was that maybe one day we were ‘gunner get home’. They didn’t tell us until the war was over that there was no chance of that happening any time soon: with millions of troops in India and south-east Asia, and only a small fleet of troopships, getting back to Blighty was a long, slow business. Jimmy Perry (right) created Dad's Army with David Croft (left) but his other comedy was his real hit, he says . David and I wrote that into one episode. When the colonel tells the gang show performers that Japan has surrendered, Gloria — the mincing little star of the show, played by Melvyn Hayes — trots off the parade ground to pack a suitcase. The sergeant-major is apoplectic. ‘Where do you think you’re going?’ he bellows. A simple line, and it got one of the biggest laughs I’ve ever heard from a studio audience. David and I didn’t write jokes, we wrote situations, so the comedy required great actors — and we had one in Windsor Davies, with his bulging eyes, needletip moustaches and booming Welsh roar. The conscripts did think they were going home, and the sergeant-majors knew only too well that, when the men were demobbed, their empires would be over. Another empire ended at the same time, of course — Britain’s. I was in India during the switch to independence, and for a lad from Barnes in London it was a strange experience. But I soaked all of it up, and any writer will tell you that such powerful impressions are bound to fuel your imagination in later life. The BBC youngsters can't accept the world was a very different place then. To pretend otherwise would be lying. India fascinated me. The languages, the smells, the great beauty, the immense poverty — the truth is, I was sad to leave. We toured for two years, as our signature tune said, ‘From Bangalore to Singapore, from Rangoon to Bombay...and if you really liked our show, we’ll come again another day’. We even found ourselves on the north-west frontier, which was ruled by bandit tribes. Our bearer was always with us, an educated and marvellously efficient man who went to extraordinary lengths for us. Before an inspection, he would work furiously to make every bit of leather and brass shine, before picking us up and carrying us on his back to the parade ground. He did it to keep the dust off us: in that heat the earth was as dry as ash. Once we were in position, he’d give our boots one final rub with his cloth. It’s bizarre to look back on that and realise that it once seemed normal — that’s how the Army worked almost 70 years ago. And that’s what the BBC youngsters cannot accept. The world was a very different place then. We can’t pretend otherwise. It would be lying. It might seem outrageous, even decadent, that a bunch of song-and-dance conscripts had to be carried around a parade ground, but that’s because we’re looking back from a 21st-century perspective. Dad's Army captured life in the army, but India fascinated Perry, and anyone who went there knows It Ain't Half Hot Mum gets it . The bearers saw their duties as deeply honourable, and took pride in performing them to the highest standard. When I finally boarded for home in 1946, my bearer asked me, with a lump in his throat: ‘Can I come home to Blighty with you, sahib?’ His name was Rangi Ram, and we kept that name for the character who narrated It Ain’t Half Hot Mum. He always talked of ‘We British’ and he had two lovely catchphrases, when he was berating his juniors, which will be familiar to viewers with long memories — ‘Damn natives!’ and ‘Don’t be such a clever dickie!’ When a British officer corrected him, he would scold himself: ‘Sahib righty, Rangi wrongy!’ At the end of every episode, Rangi delivered some piece of spurious wisdom, with the words: ‘There is an old Hindu proverb . . .’ And then he would tell us a bit of nonsense, such as: ‘When you have cholera and Delhi belly, it does not stop your house from catching fire.’ Our lead actor, Michael Bates, was born in India, spoke Urdu and Hindi. He loved India, and so did I. To play a character who meant so much to me, we needed a special actor. And we found one in the great Michael Bates. He was born to British parents in India, the son of an Empire civil servant. He spoke Urdu and Hindi fluently, and sometimes he and I would talk in the pidgin Urdu that I had picked up in the Forces. Like most children of Empire, he’d had an Indian nurse, an ‘ayah’, who taught him the best of her own culture. He never lost the ability to squat on his haunches — a great relaxation trick. He died tragically young of cancer in 1978, aged 57. Michael loved India, and so did I. That shines through in every episode of It Ain’t Half Hot Mum, and we made nearly 60. But because he is a white man wearing a turban and playing a native Indian, we are accused of racism. People claim Michael was ‘blacking up’, which is simply not true. He just needed a little make-up to tan his skin, a trick that every newsreader uses these days. We would have been delighted to use Indian actors, if we could have found any. This was the first BBC sitcom even to be set outside Britain, and we did not live in a multicultural society in the Seventies (the series ran from 1974 to 1981). It was considered normal for Larry Olivier or Donald Sinden to ‘black up’ when they played Othello — today, that would be wrong, but those were different times. We did get an excellent Bangladeshi actor to play the ‘char wallah’, the boy who brings the tea urn round. His name was Dino Shafeek, and if I remember correctly he was working in a restaurant as a waiter when he first auditioned. It frustrates me that television today is run by people who don’t know their history. They don’t want to face the fact that, within my lifetime, Britain ruled a third of the world’s population — so they ignore it. It’s such a waste: vintage comedy is a wonderful tool to help a new generation understand the past. Many people in the industry will agree with me but can’t speak up because they might lose their jobs. I have the advantage of being 90, so I can say what I like. It takes courage to face the past and confront sensitive issues. Sadly, by banning It Ain’t Half Hot Mum from our screens, the BBC is taking the cowardly way out.","It Ain't Half Hot Mum deemed politically incorrect by Corporation .

Strolling down the sunny Californian streets, Connor Cruise and his friend Alanna Masters look like two average all-American kids. But as the son of Tom Cruise, arguably Scientology’s most esteemed member, Connor, 18, is the ‘worst person’ for  Alanna to become close to, according to her father. Joe Reaiche, 55, who has not seen his two children for the past nine years since being ex-communicated from the church, told MailOnline: ‘If there is any chance that Alanna is connected to Connor, he is the worst person for her to be around. The more she’s around him, the deeper into the church she goes. Warning: Alanna Masterson's estranged father Joe Reaiche has said he thinks it is dangerous for her to be too close with Connor Cruise, the son of Scientology bigwig Tom Cruise . Buddies: Connor Cruise and Alanna Masterson pose for a cheeky photo alongside a friend. The striking brunette is believed to be dating DJ Jesse Marco . Hanging out: Alanna Masterson joins pals including Connor Cruise at a fairground . The former Australian rugby league player joined Scientology in 1978 and left in 2005 – and has since then been an outspoken critic of the mysterious religion. And he said he was wary of A list star Tom mainly because of his close friendship to Scientology leader David Miscavige, adding: ‘Tom and David are like twins – they’re like two peas in a pod. 'I think Tom he has turned a blind eye to issues with his church. And they have been very careful not to show him the dark side.’ Joe was a professional footballer and almost 20 when he joined Scientology after he believed the church had healed a long-running groin injury. He married fellow Scientologist Carol Masterson in 1985, the mother of actors Danny and Christopher Masterson, and the couple went on to have a son Jordan, now 27, and Alanna, now 25. 'Tom Cruise and David Miscavige are like twins - they're like two peas in a pod...I think Tom has turned a blind eye to issues with his church' Following the breakdown of his marriage, Joe, a plain-speaking Aussie who now lives in Long Island, New York, started to question the church and the religion that had been part of his life for so long. After '18 years of constant learning and exorbitant costs’, Joe estimates he had paid out to ‘close to $400,000’ on Scientology services and sources for him and his wife. Joe told how the couple were invited to an event in Clearwater in 1996 by David Miscaviage where he alleges they were informed the church had developed a ‘more exact approach to the Spritual Bridge of Total Freedom and corrected the system, therefore all prior spiritual services or courses that were done by you over the last 18 years was incorrect and hindered your results. ‘ . This new system was called The Golden Age of technology and would cost another $20,000 for Joe and Carol to correct the past. The tipping point came, said Joe, when he was on business in Atlanta and was called by one of the Church’s executives in New York’s ‘Justice Division’ and ordered to arrive in New York within 24 hours – or he would be considered a Supressive Person for non-compliance. This, Joe said, he simply did not want to comply to – and was indeed told to leave. 'No religion has the right to ruin you and split up your family': Furious Joe Reaiche hits out as he reveals he has not been able to speak to his two children for the past nine years after being ex-communicated from the church of Scientology . Siblings: That Seventies Show star Danny Masterson with his sister Alanna and brothers Christopher and Jordan at a Scientology Christmas event in Hollywood, CA, in 2006 .

Alanna, now a striking brunette who has most recently been dating DJ Jesse Marco, and her siblings were educated within Scientology, as were Connor and his sister Isabella. And and records show she – alongside her mother and brothers – have each donated $35,000 of their own money to the church to reach Cornerstone status within the past few years. Being shut out of the church in 2005 meant that Joe has not seen his children – including the step-sons he helped raise – for the past nine years. Indeed, he only found out about his daughter’s friendship with Connor Cruise after following her on Twitter. 'If my daughter has a brain, she . should say ‘how can my father be an evil person?' Is Leah Remini evil? Come on! Could all of these people be lying about the church?' ‘I have to follow my kids on Twitter because all my photos are with my ex-wife, I never thought I would have to be digging for photos of them online,’ said Joe. ‘And then someone contacted me to let me know a picture had gone viral of her with Connor Cruise. ‘If Alanna is hanging around with someone like Connor, it will be very hard to realise what is wrong with the church – and want to leave.’ Joe, who last week told Scientology blogger Tony Ortega: ‘ I call Tom the Prince of Darkness — he’s got a warped view of Scientology and I don’t want my daughter anywhere near him’ – said he had been prompted to speak out in the wake of Leah Remini’s departure from Scientology last week. Hugs: Alanna Masterson cuddles up to Connor Cruise and a friend during a night out . He said: ‘Leah is a strong girl with a ton of money, I knew her when she was 17 and she’s  a b***h on wheels if you p**s her off! ‘I’m in the position now where I have to keep a Google alert for my children, they won’t take my phone calls, they won’t accept cards. ‘If my daughter has a brain, she should say ‘how can my father be an evil person? Is Leah Remini evil? Come on! Could all of these people be lying about the church? ‘Her mother is a staunch supporter and once they have their hooks in you, there’s no remorse.’ ‘I’m not perfect’, admitted Joe, who has remained single since his divorce, ‘I did mistakes, but does that make me evil?

The clip portrays the pilot as a 'loving, reflective, generous, cool, sporting, intelligent, supportive...' man. The family then pleads: 'Come home, we miss you'. One key focus of the investigation into Captain Zaharie and his co-pilot, Fariq Ab Hamid, is the make-shift home flight simulator built by Zaharie to mirror the set-up of the Boeing 777-200 he was flying with MH370. US aviation expert John Nance has told ABC News that the simulator, which features three wide-screen monitors and an overheard panel, will be inspected to see if it may have helped plot the disappearance of MH370.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:17 EST, 17 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:37 EST, 17 March 2014 . Researchers have revealed that earlier reports of a massive drop in preschoolers’ obesity rates were overstated and based on skewed data. To many in the field, a study was published in late February in the Journal of the American Medical Association seemed too good to be true- and now they believe it was. In fact, based on the researchers' own data, the obesity rate may have even risen rather than declined. No one had a ready explanation for that astounding finding by researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: anti-obesity campaigners credited everything from changes to the federal nutrition program for low-income women and children to the elimination of trans-fats from fast food, more physical activity in child-care programs and declining consumption of sugary drinks. False start: An earlier study has been re-examined after making major claims about improved health of children ages 2 to 5 years and now it is believed the obesity rate either stayed the same or increased . First Lady Michelle Obama and others seized on the finding as a sign that efforts to combat the national obesity epidemic were paying off. But as obesity specialists take a closer look at the data, some are questioning the 43 per cent claim, suggesting that it may be a statistical fluke and pointing out that similar studies find no such decrease in obesity among preschoolers. 'You need to have a healthy degree of skepticism about the validity of this finding,' said Dr. Lee Kaplan, director of the weight center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Targeting kids: Michelle Obama is dedicated to her healthy eating and active lifestyle initiative which strives to make American children healthier . No evidence of the kinds of major shifts in the behavior among preschoolers aged 2 to 5 exists which would explain a 43 per cent drop in their obesity rates, he said. The latest study is based a well-respected data set taken from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES, which has been conducted annually since the 1960s and involves in-person interviews and physical exams. The CDC defines obesity in adults as having a body mass index - a ratio of weight to height - above 30, but in children it is defined by where the individual falls on age- and sex-specific growth charts. The 2011-2012 version of the survey included 9,120 people; 871 of them were 2 to 5 years old. In some research 871 would be considered a large number. But when the obesity rate is fairly low, having a sample of a few hundred makes it easier for errors to creep in through random chance. 'In small samples like this, you are going to have chance fluctuations,' said epidemiologist Geoffrey Kabat of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. The CDC scientists were aware of the statistical limitations of their data, and their paper clearly stated that the findings were imprecise. The 43 per cent headline figure refers to the drop from the 13.9 per cent rate in 2003-04 to the 8.4 per cent rate in 2011-2012. Questioning the numbers: This graph shows the data from the February report which has now been questioned because this group used too small a sample size . The change of 5.5 points represents a decline of 40 per cent from the original 13.9 per cent. (The 43 per cent trumpeted by a CDC press release comes from rounding those numbers to 14 and 8, respectively.) The 13.9 per cent obesity rate among preschoolers reported for 2003-2004 had a large enough margin of error that the actual rate could range between 10.8 per cent and 17.6 per cent, the CDC authors acknowledged. The 8.4 per cent rate in 2011-2012 reported could range from 5.9 per cent and 11.6 per cent. Since the range for 2003-2004 overlaps with that of 2011-2012, Kabat said, 'that's another way of saying there might have been no change' in preschoolers' obesity rate. Even an increase is a statistical possibility. Indeed, the CDC scientists' conclusion is that 'there have been no significant changes in obesity prevalence in youth or adults between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012.' Even so, a CDC press release trumpeted in its first sentence 'a significant decline in obesity among children aged 2 to 5 years,' with obesity prevalence for this group showing 'a decline of 43 per cent.' No drastic changes for decades: Researchers now believe that the true findings prove there has not been a dramatic drop in recent years . In addition, claiming a 43 per cent plunge in preschooler obesity 'isn't really properly descriptive of the trend,' because the rates have bounced around over the last decade, the spokeswoman, Corey Slavitt, said. A study of preschoolers in the federal WIC (Women, Infants and Children) program, which provides food vouchers, nutrition classes and counseling to low-income families, found virtually no change in obesity rates. Rather than reducing the prevalence of obesity among 3-and-4-year olds in the WIC program in California's Los Angeles County, researchers found that the problem worsened from 2003 to 2011. Obesity rose to 20.4 per cent from about 17 per cent, the researchers reported in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in 2013. In New York, the WIC study found that obesity rates fell to 15.5 per cent in 2011 from about 19.5 per cent in 2003, a much less dramatic drop than the 40 per cent decline. 'We agree there is a slight downward trend in obesity among 2-to-5-year olds,' said Shannon Whaley, a co-author of the WIC study. An earlier weigh in: The obesity rate for younger Americans took a significant dive over the past ten years . But a 43 per cent drop is absolutely not what we're seeing.' The WIC study included more than 200,000 children, while the CDC researchers 'looked at just a small population of 2-to-5-year olds,' said Whaley, who serves as director of research and evaluation at the Public Health Enterprises Foundation. For obesity rates to drop, researchers reckon, young children have to eat differently and become more active. But research shows little sign of such changes among 2-to-5-year olds, casting more doubt on the 43 per cent claim. Such a decline would require changes in exercise, food consumption and sleep patterns, said Mass General's Kaplan 'There is no evidence of that,' he said. In 2010 Whaley and her colleagues examined the effectiveness of WIC classes and counseling to encourage healthy eating and activities for women and children in the program. Their findings were discouraging: Television watching and consumption of sweet or salty snacks actually rose, while fruit and vegetable consumption fell - changes that could lead to weight gain.

Two boxers stunned their girlfriends by getting down on one knee and proposing to both of them, moments after finishing a gruelling fight. Adrian Firkins, 44, and Ricky Welsby, 24, may not see eye to eye in the ring but the pair made the perfect team when it came to proposing to their partners on Friday night. The pair had exchanged blows for three rounds after going toe-to-toe in the semi-pro BBU welterweight fight at the Copthorne Hotel, Merry Hill, in the West Midlands. Debbie Tyler, 41, and Nikki Vyse, 22, were called into the ring for what they believed to be post-match photos . Both of the women accepted their boyfriends' proposals: Debbie (pictured left, in the foreground) says yes to Adrian Firkins, while Nikki Vyse (pictured right) also gets down on one knee as boyfriend Ricky Welsby pops the question . After the contest, promoter Peter Jackson called Debbie Tyler, 41 (Adrian's girlfriend) and Nikki Vyse, 22 (Ricky's girlfriend) into the ring for what they believed to be post-match promotional photos with their partners. But the bruised and battered pair then shocked their other halves by dropping to one knee - after managing to stay on their feet for the entire fight - in order to pop the question. To their delight both the women said yes before they received a standing ovation from the hundreds of fans watching. Both boxers joked it was lucky that they didn't knock each other out during the fight and agreed a draw was a fitting result before their big moment. Adrian (left) and Ricky (right) planned their proposals so that they would follow their fight in the ring . Both boxers agreed that they were far more nervous about the proposal than the fight, which concluded in a draw . The fight came to a draw which both boxers agreed was a fitting result for the occasion . Father-of-two Adrian, from Halesowen, West Midlands, said: 'I'm glad I got through it and didn't get knocked out, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to propose to Debbie.' It was upon hearing that his opponent, Ricky, was planning to propose to his girlfriend that Adrian decided it ought to be a joint effort. 'I was speaking to Pete Jackson and he told me that my opponent was thinking about proposing to his missus before the fight. 'I had been thinking about doing the same so I told him, he spoke to Ricky and we decided to do it together.' He added that having his opponent there with him gave him the added confidence to get through with the public proposal.

Adrian Firkins with fiancee Debbie Tyler - the couple have been together for over 16 years . 'I think it took a bit of pressure off knowing someone else was next to me on one knee. I spoke to Ricky before the fight and we both agreed how we were going to do it. 'I think we were both more nervous about the proposal than the fight. 'Once the result was read out we got the girls in the ring, Pete gave us the engagement rings and we both got on one knee at the same time.' Not only was the proposal a shock for Debbie but also for the bystanders of the match who had no idea that the proposal was going ahead. 'Debbie was so shocked, she really couldn't believe it, so were my family and friends in the crowd, I hadn't told any of them so it came completely out of the blue for them. 'I'm happy she said yes and a bit . relieved, it would have been pretty embarrassing if I would have been . rejected in the middle of the ring in front of everyone.' Debbie, a housekeeper, who has been . with Adrian for 16 years, added: 'I know it happened on Friday but I . think I am still in shock. I just really didn't expect him to do something like that. The girlfriends weren't the only ones in shock, no one in the crowd was aware of the planned proposal . Boxers Adrian Firkins (silver & black shorts) and Ricky Welsby (black and gold shorts) pictured as they pop the question to their girlfriends . 'When he went down on one knee I still had no clue what he was doing and when I saw the ring I was gobsmacked. 'Me and Nikki thought we were just going to have a picture for the promotion so we both had no clue. 'I am over the moon with the proposal, I just can't believe he managed to keep it secret for so long.' Ricky, a warehouse worker from Cradley Heath, West Midlands, added: 'Everything went perfectly, it really couldn't have gone any better, a draw was a fair result and both the girls said yes, it was just brilliant. 'Nikki was so shocked when she saw me . on one knee with the ring, I had been planning it for months but she . didn't have a clue, she was shaking and I was so happy she said yes. 'Everyone in my family and her family knew about it, I don't know how we managed to keep it from her but we did. Ricky, who is used to public appearances in the ring, added that he had never been so nervous in his life. Boxers Adrian Firkins (silver & black shorts) and Ricky Welsby (black and gold shorts) place the rings on the fingers of their partners after proposing to them at a charity boxing event . 'It is probably the most nerve-wracking thing I have had to do in my life, especially in front of that many people.' Nikki, a full-time carer, said that she doesn't usually appreciate being put in the limelight but says she is very happy to be engaged. 'I don't usually like to be the centre of attention, I was so shocked and didn't know what he was doing on one knee. I can't believe they managed to keep it from me but it was great and I was so happy. 'We are just looking forward to the future now' Promoter Pete Jackson, a former boxer of 15-years, said it is the first time in his career he had ever seen a proposal in the ring. 'I have been promoting fights for the past eight years and I currently manage 40 fighters, but I have never in my time seen anything like this. 'People were choked up in the crowd, it was a special moment and I don't expect to see something like that again.

The annual Football Money League by Deloitte, published on Thursday, sees Bayern Munich overtake the Premier League champions in earning power too. United actually made more money in 2012/13 than in the previous season but dropped from third to fourth because of the remarkable gains made by the German treble-winners. United fell out of the top three for the first time in the publication’s 17-year history. They are expected to rise next year, despite their struggles on the pitch, because of the new Premier League broadcast rights. Drop: Man United slipped out of the top three of the Football Money League for the first time in the publication's 17-year history . Celebrations: Bayern Munich, Champions League winners in 2013, jumped to third in the football rich list . Rich list: The annual Football Money League by Deloitte sees Real Madrid top the overall standings . The money table has been compiled by Deloitte since 1997, and for the first eight years United were the biggest-earning club in the world only to be overtaken by first Real Madrid, then Barcelona and now Bayern. United's fall will concern the club's shareholders the most, especially since shares on the New York stock exchange are down just above the 15-dollar mark from an annual high of more than 19 dollars. Real Madrid stretched their lead at the top, turning over £444.7million (€518.9m) last season, compared to second-place Barcelona’s £413.6m (€482.6m). Bayern made £369.6m (€431.2m), just ahead of United’s £363.2m (€423.8m). Top of the league: Lionel Messi's Barcelona (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid (right) top the rich list . Manchester City marked their emergence onto the global scene by beating domestic rivals Chelsea and Arsenal for the first time, largely thanks to a growth in commercial revenues. City came sixth overall with £271m (€316.2m), Chelsea seventh with £260m (€303.4m) and Arsenal £243.6m (€284.3m). City’s revenues rose by just under £40m and it appears as though they will scrape through UEFA’s Financial Fair Play test. Official financial figures for 2012/13 are yet to be released, but that increase should be enough to meet the requirements and avoid the threat of a Champions League ban. Climb: Manchester City beat Arsenal and Chelsea for the first time and moved up to sixth in the table . Seventh heaven: Chelsea are sandwiched between Man City and Arsenal with £260m worth of revenue . Flying high: Arsenal currently top the Premier League table but are eighth in Deloitte's Money League . 4. Manchester United £363.2m . 6. Manchester City £271m . 7. Chelsea £260m . 8. Arsenal £243.6m . 12. Liverpool £206m . 14. Tottenham £147.4m . 25. Newcastle United £91.5m . 29. West Ham United £85.7m . Questions over matchday income were aired after figures showed it has doubled in one year – from around £20m to £39.6m. Ed Thompson, the FFP commentator and analyst, said: ‘It could be that they have taken out a mortgage against one year’s advance match day income. It is certainly a baffling figure.’ The Deloitte report said: ‘The overall revenue increase is driven largely by a growth in commercial revenue as the club expand into new markets and seek to develop its brand internationally. The agreement with Etihad Airways is the centre piece of the club’s commercial success.’ Growth: The Deloitte report said Manchester City's partnership with Etihad Airways is the 'centre piece of the club's commercial success' Meanwhile, the Money League also illustrates how . clubs which are taken over by super-rich owners can swiftly see huge . increases in revenue. In 2009, Manchester City and PSG were 20th and . 21st in the table but have seen significant growth, notably in terms of . commercial income. Paris Saint-Germain rocketed into the top five after a huge 81 per cent increase on turnover to £341.8m (€398.8), partly down to the arrival of David Beckham. The . report said: ‘Since Qatar Sports Investments acquired a controlling . stake in the club in June 2011, PSG’s revenue has almost quadrupled. The . club has rapidly expanded its commercial portfolio over the last two . seasons, whilst the high-profile signing of David Beckham in the second . half of the 2012/13 season only served to enhance the club’s worldwide . profile.’ Money magnet: Paris Saint-Germain rocketed into the top five, partly down to the signing of David Beckham . Like Man City, the French champions also benefited from a major sponsorship deal related to the club's owners. PSG's Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorhsip, which will net the French club £160m annually until 2016, has eclipsed City's £400m-plus Etihad deal which is over 10 years. All such related sponsorship deals will be studied by UEFA as part of the European governing body's financial fair play rules to ensure they are of 'fair market value'. Liverpool have dropped out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999 - the Reds are in 12th spot with revenue of £206m (€240.6m)  behind Juventus, AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund, while Tottenham are in 14th place with earnings of £147.4m (€172m).

Michelle Obama has told how she tries to encourage healthy eating habits for her teenage girls without getting into the potentially tense conversations about weight gain or looks. 'We don't talk about weight. We don't talk about physical appearance. We talk about health. We talk about what's on the inside, so we keep our messages really simple and practical,' the First Lady said in an interview that aired Friday on The Today Show. 'I want my girls to grow up to be strong, healthy young women who aren't afraid to exercise and they see it as fun. Scroll down for video . Tense talk: Rather than potentially harm her daughter's self confidence, Mrs Obama told how she focuses conversations around internal health and wellness rather than physical appearance . Growing girls: Sasha (holding her mother's hand) and Malia (holding her father's hand, seen in October) are 12 and 15 years old respectively and have grown dramatically since their father took office in 2008 . 'All I think about is whether my kids are happy and safe and if they're growing up and learning values.' While she may try to shield Sasha and Malia from the glare of the spotlight, she is subject to the scrutiny of the White House. Mrs Obama was interviewed by Today Show correspondent and former First Daughter Jenna Bush Hager, who said that she was well versed in what it was like to be a teenage girl that called 1600 Pennsylvania home. They talked about how the attention paid to Mrs Obama's clothes or looks can be both annoying and useful, and has been something that she needed to embrace. Enjoying the workout: This week marked the fourth anniversary of the First Lady's Let's Move campaign . Protective: Mrs Obama said that her first priority has always been her daughter's safety and well being . 'It's always there. I'm not the first one to go through it. Your mom, you know, it was the same thing for her. I still know what dresses she wore for state dinners,' Mrs Obama said. 'My philosophy has been, okay, if you're looking at me for whatever reason, let me make sure I'm standing in front of something really important so while you're seeing my shoes, you may also see these kids jumping around in this preschool. So as long as the outcome is substantive, I'm okay with the means to the end.' This week marked the fourth anniversary of her Let's Move healthy eating initiative and she celebrated with a series of events up and down the east coast. Mrs Obama said that the initiative came out of a cultural shift in the way that American families are eating. Cultural shift: Mrs Obama said that she thinks the initiative was needed because when she was growing up (seen here as a baby), families didn't eat dinner at fast food restaurants and always had a vegetable in their meals . 'When we were growing up it wasn't an issue because our natural existence was fairly healthy. Rarely did you go out to eat in fast food restaurants. My mom cooked dinner, we always had a vegetable,' she said. 'That's one the reasons why I've been so passionate about this with Let's move because we know how to do this. We just sort of lost our way as a society and as parents and if we give parents the information we can get them back on track, I know we can.' Known for her early morning work outs and vegetable-heavy meals, Mrs Obama said that she does her part to try to lead the way for both the girls and the country at large. 'I try to model the behavior that we talk about all the time,' she said. That behavior includes regular dancing spoof videos, like the one that aired on Jimmy Fallon's show earlier this week. 'You know, fortunately they weren't too horrified,' about the skit with Fallon and Will Farrell dressed in drag. 'I think that they're used to me doing really silly things to get people engaged and laughing.'","Mrs Obama said that her conversations with Sasha and Malia are focused on their nutrition in terms of how healthy they feel .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . PUBLISHED: . 11:05 EST, 11 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:32 EST, 11 March 2014 . A militant Islamist website has created a series of posters calling for attacks on France and for the assassination of President Francois Hollande in reprisal for the country's policies in Mali and the Central African Republic. In addition to assisting Mali in its war against Islamists, France sent troops four months ago to the majority Christian Central African Republic, where predominantly Muslim 'Seleka' rebels seized power a year ago. The Seleka have since been pushed back by Christian 'anti-balaka' - known as 'anti-machete' in the local language - militia. Francois Hollande (pictured giving a speech today) has been threatened with assassination by Islamic extremists after sending troops into the Central African Republic to help fight Muslim rebels . The al Minbar Jihadi Media Network, a well-known Islamist website, created six posters as part of a campaign it dubbed 'We will not be silent, O France,' according to the SITE monitoring service. The forum's 'Media soldiers for the support of Islam' designed the posters, which can be downloaded and printed by visitors to the site. France's troops in the Central African Republic, around 2,000 soldiers, are supporting a 6,000-strong African Union peacekeeping mission. 'To our lone-wolves in France, assassinate the president of disbelief and criminality, terrify his cursed government, and bomb them and scare them as a support to the vulnerable in the Central African Republic,' one of the posters said. War against Islam: A French sniper holds his rifle in Bangui, Central African Republic, where Hollande sent troops four months ago after Muslim rebels seized power a year ago . Asked about the threat today, Hollande said: 'We are extremely vigilant' but noted 'it's not the first time there are threats.' Hollande has said his troops would work to stop the Central African Republic splitting in two and to disarm rival fighters. A source in the French president's office said that while the government was very alert to the threat of attacks, they were not a new phenomenon. 'This is not the first time there have been threats,' the source said. 'There were others during the Mali intervention and even before, so we took precautionary measures. 'Just because they (threats) are being publicised does not mean that they are new... Sometimes they are more dangerous when they are not publicised.' A French-led offensive in January 2013 (above) drove out Islamist militants who seized control of northern Mali . Al Minbar Jihadi Media Network publishes news for various Al Qaeda affiliates and other jihadists and has had an online magazine since July last year. A French-led offensive in January 2013 drove out Islamist militants who had seized control of northern Mali. Small groups of fighters loyal to Islamist groups including the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa and al Qaeda in the Maghreb still operate in the desert region, carrying out periodic attacks. Kidnappings and killing of French nationals has since then taken place as a form of reprisal. Two French journalists were abducted and killed in Northern Mali in November, with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claiming responsibility.","Militant website has produced posters calling for attacks on France .

Her father served as a High Priest and Bishop for the church. The dark-haired beauty stood out in the small town after shooting up to 6ft by the age of 12. She eventually grew to 6ft 3in with 42 inch legs, raven hair and porcelain skin. Her lofty stature at such a young age . also helped sew the seeds for her success as a stylist and designer in . later life.

She told the . paper: ‘'I remember finding a black silk 1950s dress, taking it home and . unpicking the waistband and the seams, then sewing it together again, . so that it would fit me.' Her glamor did not go unnoticed and after graduating high school in 1985 aged 17, a chance meeting led to her being spotted by celebrity photographer Bruce Weber. On Weber’s advice she avoided going to New York where ‘they wouldn’t get her’ and bought a one-way plane ticket to Paris. Despite knowing no one and not speaking the language, she paid the fare using her savings from babysitting jobs and launched herself on the European fashion scene. It was then that she changed her name to L’Wren Scott. Young beauty: L'Wren with her mother Lula at the family home in   Roy, Utah in 1991 .

The soon-to-be fashion model grew to 6ft by the time she was 12 . L'Wren Scott married property entrepreneur, Anthony Brand (pictured) in 1993. They divorced after just three years of marriage . She reportedly had the longest legs . that designers had ever seen which quickly landed a succession of . high-profile modeling gigs for Chanel and Thierry Mugler. Her . 42-inch legs were stars of an iconic Pretty Polly stockings ad shot by . David Bailey. However she admitted: 'I wasn't good at being objectified. I was always a very behind-the scenes person.' She dated wealthy, London-based property . developer Andrew Ladsky, who is related to the Boucheron jewellery . dynasty. But their three-year relationship ended acrimoniously in 1991 . in a row about the ownership of a sheepskin coat and two pictures. In 1994, tiring of Paris, Scott reinvented herself again and moved to Los Angeles to head up PR for Prada. It was then she began work as a celebrity stylist, working with celebrity photographer Herb Ritts. She soon became the go to dresser for stars including Nicole Kidman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Ellen Barkin and Julianne Moore. In 2000, she was the named the official stylist of the Oscars. She married another property entrepreneur, Anthony Brand. But they divorced after just three years of marriage in 1996. In 2001, she began dating Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger after meeting at a photo-shoot in Paris where she had been hired as a stylist. They made for an unusual coupling, as she stood head and shoulders above his 5ft 8inch frame and was 23 years his junior. However they were together for 13 years, longer than Jagger's marriages to Bianca Jagger and Jerry Hall. L'Wren's mother Lula told a newspaper in 2003: 'L'Wren is very independent and would not take any nonsense from anyone no matter how famous they were. 'She usually knows what she wants and she gets it. It doesn't surprise me at all that she's tamed Mick. She is very much her own woman and it would be my guess that is why this Mick Jagger likes her.' Despite being a rock star’s girlfriend she was by no means a fawning groupie. In fact she once admitted, when asked about her love of Rolling Stones songs: 'I loved Motown, and blues, and classical music, but never rock 'n' roll.' The late L'Wren Scott became an internationally recognized fashion designer and the girlfriend of Rolling Stones legend Mick Jagger. She is pictured as a young girl at her Utah home in 1977 .

The young Luann, pictured right in 1967 with her parents and siblings was adopted by Mormon couple Ivan and Lula soon after she was born . In 2006, Scott finally decided to launch (with Jagger's help) her own line of clothing and has since launched many collections that have won the praise of the A-List. Sarah Jessica Parker once said: 'I think L'Wren has an extraordinary ability to make dresses that genuinely flatter a woman. She makes an unbelievably contemporary dress in a remarkably old-fashioned way for all sorts of women and body types.' She also designed lines for Barney’s in New York and Banana Republic. Her first handbag line she named Lula after her mother 'who always carried a bag with her to work every day'. Though she based her showroom in Paris, Scott spent her time shuttling between the $10million  London home that Jagger had bought for them in 2007 and her $5.6million New York City apartment. Scott made the surprise announcement last month that she was canceling her London Fashion Week show reportedly due to production delays with some key pieces in her collection.

"FA Cup in 2005 was the last trophy won by Arsene Wenger's side . Chief executive Ivan Gazidis tells AGM Arsenal will thrive under Financial Fair Play . The Gunners are already 10 points off the pace in the Premier League . Gazidis defended Wenger's record against big-spending rivals . By . Sami Mokbel . PUBLISHED: . 06:20 EST, 25 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:41 EST, 25 October 2012 . Stan Kroenke leaped to the defence of his Arsenal regime in the face of a fierce attack from club shareholders. The Gunners board, including majority . shareholder Kroenke, chief executive Ivan Gazidis and chairman Peter . Hill-Wood, came under scathing criticism from supporters at the annual . general meeting. Testing times: Arsene Wenger spoke at the AGM - less than 24 hours after Arsenal's home defeat to Schalke . Big blow: Arsenal were beaten at home by Schalke in the Champions League on Wednesday night . Supporters are disillusioned with the perceived lack of investment in the playing squad and the cost of tickets. Kroenke said: ‘I am ambitious for the club. We have an exciting future and our goal is to win trophies.’ Not even the silver-tongued Arsene Wenger could keep the heat off Arsenal’s board at Thursday's stormy AGM. The manager did his best to placate irate fans who arrived intent on venting their anger at the top table. Heated: Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis had to call for order at the AGM . But no amount of smooth talking was going to prevent the Gunners’ supporters from making their feelings clear. Majority shareholder Stan Kroenke was . roundly jeered by shareholders when refusing to provide a definitive . answer on whether he has plans to take a dividend percentage out of the . club coffers. Similar treatment was dished out to . chief executive Ivan Gazidis as he reeled off reasons why Arsenal will . be in a financial position to compete in the transfer market for the . world’s best players in two years. Serious business: Majority shareholder Stan Kroenke (left), chairman Peter Hill -Wood and and Gazidis . ‘We’ve heard it all before,’ yelled  shareholders as Gazidis spelt out . why the club’s self-sustaining financial model means on-the-pitch . success will follow in the not-too-distant future. It’s hard not to have a degree of  sympathy with Arsenal supporters. No . trophy since 2005, two successive summers of losing their best players . and a team 10 points adrift of Premier League leaders Chelsea. And if the heckling was not enough, there were even boos for the club’s . 76-year-old chairman Peter Hill-Wood, whose patronising behaviour . towards supporters angered shareholders. Unpleasant viewing: Wenger (left) and Stan Kroenke (right) at the Schalke game on Wednesday night . As ever, Wenger tried his best but even the Frenchman could not ignore . the fact divisions are starting to appear, particularly among the club’s . fan base. ‘There seems to be a lot of dissatisfaction, I can understand that,’ said Wenger. ‘But we have to be united. I accept every different opinion . but it looks to me like the modern world produces little groups of . little opinion. ‘The little communities need to live together for the common strength of . our club, for the good of Arsenal. Sometimes you can forget that. But . if everybody is devastated when we finish third in the league, I promise . I won’t be here when we finish 15th in the league. 'Players ask: are you in the Champions League? A new player doesn't want to know if you have won the League Cup.'

A Philadelphia college student died of the same type of meningitis that caused an outbreak at Princeton University in New Jersey, suggesting the strain might still exist on the Ivy League campus despite a massive vaccination effort, federal health officials said Tuesday. Stephanie Ross, a Drexel University sophomore from Pittsburgh, had been in close contact with Princeton students about a week before getting sick, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She died March 10. More than 5,000 members of the Princeton community, mostly undergraduate students, received inoculations for the meningitis B strain, but vaccinated individuals can still carry the bacteria in their throats and transmit it to others, the CDC said in a statement. The agency urged vigilance in preventing new cases. Spreading: Stephanie Ross (left) was found unresponsive in her room earlier this month by her Drexel University sorority sisters and officials now say she had the same strain of Meningitis B as an outbreak at Princeton . The outbreak at Princeton has infected eight this year, prompting the school's administration to vaccinate the university community of 5,000. Officials say the case at Drexel doesn't mean it will spread more at the other campus . 'Although transmission is from person-to-person, this organism is not highly contagious and requires sharing respiratory and oral secretions to spread,' the statement said. The CDC said there is no outbreak at Drexel, which is about 40 miles from Princeton. Meningitis causes swelling of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord and is fairly rare in the U.S. But the illness develops quickly and, left untreated, can be fatal within a couple of days. Symptoms include a stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity and confusion. Drexel officials said they have provided preventive antibiotics to everyone who came into close contact with Ross, a mechanical engineering major who was found unresponsive at her sorority house. Tragic loss: Ross (left) was loved by her teachers and her fellow students . The New York Daily News reports that Ross was a popular student who majored in mechanical engineering and played for her college's softball team. She was a stand-out student in both high school and college. 'Stephanie was an outstanding young woman who exemplified the values we have for students at Upper St. Clair in terms of academics, extra-curricular activities and community involvement. At USC, Stephanie was a National Merit Scholar, softball player, and volunteer,' said her High School's Superintendent Patrick O'Toole in a statement to WTAE. Ross was just as loved at her college as she was at her high school. Facebook shows numerous photos of her and her sorority sisters having fun at parties and college events. Ross was a charitable girl and her last post on facebook announced that she planned to donate eight inches of her hair to a charity that provides wigs to children with cancer. Stephanie Ross' unfortunate case of meningitis may seem like a freak incident, but meningitis at college campuses is on the rise. The Princeton outbreak began in March 2013 and sickened seven students and a campus visitor. All have recovered. The most recent case was identified on November 21. The university offered the B strain vaccine to eligible members of the campus community a couple of weeks later, and about 5,300 students and staff got the first of two shots. The second dose was administered last month. A statement from Princeton released Tuesday urged people not share drinking glasses, eating utensils, smoking materials and other items. New Jersey health officials have said there is no need to cancel any school events or activities. Stopping the outbreak: Ross (left) died suddenly and all students who came into contact with her are urged to take antibiotics . College life cut short: Ross (left) only made it to her Sophomore year at Drexel University . The vaccine, Bexsero, made by Switzerland-based Novartis, is approved for use in Europe, Australia and Canada but not yet for general use in the United States. The CDC recommended the unusual step of allowing Princeton to offer it, a move approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Federal officials also permitted the University of California in Santa Barbara to hold a vaccination clinic with Bexsero in February. Four students at UC Santa Barbara fell ill in November with a form of bacterial meningitis similar to the Princeton cases. Three recovered and the fourth had both feet amputated.","An outbreak of rare Meningitis B has infected eight students at the Ivy League college last year .

A gas main leak has been found at the site of the explosion that killed eight people and leveled two Manhattan buildings, federal investigators said Tuesday but cautioned that they're still a long way from determining what caused the blast. The leaking gas main was adjacent to 1646 Park Avenue, one of the buildings destroyed in the March 12 blast, the National Transportation Safety Board said. According to the NTSB, the leak was detected during a pressure test on the 8-inch main beneath Park Avenue. A tracer gas escaped under normal operating pressure, investigators said. Break in gas main: NTSB officials say they've found a leak in the gas main at the site of last week's deadly Harlem apartment building explosion . Authorities have said the blast erupted about 15 minutes after someone from a neighboring building reported smelling gas. And the NTSB said Friday that that underground tests conducted in the hours after the explosion registered high concentrations of natural gas. However, board spokesman Eric Weiss said investigators were far from deciding what caused the explosion. 'We don't determine the probable cause until the very, very end,' he said. The NTSB said it will excavate the area near the leak to expose the gas main, parts of which are made of cast iron and date back to 1887. Positive ID: Hunter College identified Sgt .

A camera probe will be run inside both the gas main and a damaged water main on Park Avenue and the resulting video will be examined, the board said. The NTSB has said it was unclear if the broken water main somehow contributed to the explosion or was caused by it. The water main dates back to 1897. The board also said segments of the gas service lines into the two buildings have been recovered from the basements and will be shipped to the NTSB lab in Washington for tests. A cracked segment of the water main will also be sent to the lab.

The tiny reptile is called the Fantastic, or the Satanic leaf tailed, gecko due to its point raised 'brow ridges'. In the wild they are masters of camouflage and mimic dead leaves and twigs. The Fantastic, or the Satanic leaf tailed, gecko is so small it can sit on the head of a pencil . Their legs look like little branches and their tails look just like dead leaves – all the way down to having veins and raggedy edges. It was born at Houston Zoo in Texas, USA, last month and will soon be on display once it grows a bit bigger. A zoo spokesman said: ‘Leaf-tailed geckos are found only on Madagascar where populations are decreasing mainly due to habitat loss caused by logging, agriculture and cattle grazing. The Gecko is so small that sometimes staff at the zoo have difficulty finding it . The Fantastic, or Satanic leaf tailed, gecko is native to Madagascar and was first described in 1888 by George Albert Boulenger (1858-1937), a British zoologist, who said it was ‘mythical’ because of its unique look. Its scientific name is Uroplatus phantasticus – meaning imaginary flat tail. Geckos have no eyelids and so they use their long, mobile tongues to wipe away any dust or debris that gets into the eye. It is a nocturnal animal feeding on insects such as crickets and moths.. When faced with a predator, it flattens its body to reduce its shadow, shows off its red mouth or sheds its tail. ‘They are active at night and eat mostly insects. ‘The females lay two eggs at a time – as an adult these animals will be between four and six inches in length. Right now he's about the same size as a pencil eraser. ‘We're often hard pressed to find them in their enclosure – sometimes you're looking right at them and don't even know it.’ The Satanic gecko will voluntarily lose its tail if threatened by a predator .","First described in 1888 and gets name from its point raised 'brow ridges'

Four veterans who served for years in the U.S. military have been grounded after their names were among those of 13 Americans believed to have been added to the government's no-fly list. The group, who have found themselves barred from flying to the U.S., are suing the government over claims that the list denies them the right to due process. For many, including Raymond Earl Knaeble IV, who converted to Islam after serving in the Army, the first sign they have of being on the list is when they are stopped from boarding flights back to their homes in the U.S. Denied: Raymond Knaeble, left, and Abe Mashal, right, are included in a lawsuit suing over the no-fly list . Knaeble served in the Army from 1999 to 2003 and, after his honorable discharge, began work for a private company in Kuwait. He later converted to Islam and joined an anti-war group but, according to his father, Knaeble is a loyal American. He first discovered he was on the no-fly list in 2010, when he tried to board a flight to Colombia after getting married. The bar meant that in order to return home to the U.S. he had to travel by bus from Panama, through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico before reaching the U.S. His father told Fox News: 'It’s affected him immensely. He can’t travel unless it’s by car or by . foot. And he has the FBI following his every move, 24/7.' Knaeble, like the others on the list, has no way of finding out why he has been barred from flights. When he was barred from boarding the plane in Colombia he was told to visit the nearest Embassy, where his passport was taken from him but no answers were given. The government has refused to confirm or deny if those bringing the case are on the no-fly list. Solution: District judge Anna Brown says officials need to find a way to let those on the list know why they have been blocked . In 2010, Mr Knaeble, who now lives in Chicago, wrote in a blogpost that he cooperated with officials, handing over his cell phone SIM card and a list of contacts in the Middle East. He claims that he has been 'interrogated day in and day out by the FBI' despite not being given a reason for why his name is on the list. The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing them, said the process used by the FBI's terrorist screening center, is unconstitutional . because those on the list have no way of knowing what caused them to be . added, and therefore are not able to contest it. According to AP, in 2012 the federal no-fly list included about 21,000 people, including 500 Americans. The 13 Americans bringing the lawsuit over their inclusion on the list have been barred from domestic flights and those flying to and from the U.S. Their names were added between 2009 and 2012. One of the other veterans suing under the lawsuit is Abe Mashal, who was trying to fly from Chicago to Washington state when he first realized he was on the no-fly list. The former Marine said the ban has caused him to miss key family events, including weddings and funerals, and said it has led to a loss for his dog-training business. According to the Huffington Post, he was added to the list after sending emails to a Muslim cleric the FBI was watching, and then refusing to hand over information about fellow Muslims. Mashal and Knaebie's cases illustrate the personal restrictions being on the no-fly list cause. A federal judge has rejected claims by the Justice Department that the list does not lead to a bar on travel by other means. In August U.S. District Judge Anna Brown rejected claims that the no-fly list does not deprive citizens of their civil liberties. She demanded a solution for those on the list to find out why they were added and to be able to maintain their right to due process. Government lawyers this week however said national security issues limited a person's rights to a hearing about their no-fly status. They warned Brown against taking over policy making if she rules the current system is unfair. In August the circuit court of appeals gave Brown responsibility for the lawsuit, which was launched in 2010. The Oregon judge has not said when she expects to make a decision in the case. Attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, Hina Shamsi, has said the current system denies Americans the right to contest the evidence that led to them being on the no-fly list. 'When . the government deprives people of those rights, it must provide them . notice and a meaningful opportunity to clear their names,' Shamsi told Fox News. Currently, those barred from boarding a flight to the U.S. can try to contest it with the Department of Homeland Security. If they are then unhappy with the department's ruling they can apply for a judicial review bit not a hearing, where evidence against them would be presented. For Knaeble and the others fighting their inclusion on the no-fly list, the travel limbo has left them in despair. 'I am a veteran of the U.S. armed forces and I have no criminal record. I am no threat to national security and have been charged with no crime,' Knaeble wrote in 2010. 'The FBI put me on a list that turned my life upside-down and there is no process in place to make them tell me why, or let me respond to any accusations they may have against me.'","Lawsuit claims those barred from flying are being denied their right to due process .

Women who use surrogate mothers to have a child do not have a legal right to maternity leave when the baby is born, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled on Tuesday. The 1992 law governing who does get maternity leave states that it must be granted to a woman ‘who has been pregnant and who has given birth to a child,’ it noted. This means that under EU law even if the birth mother gives the baby away, she still retains the right to maternity leave. The European Union's highest court said . EU ‘law does not establish a right to paid leave equal to maternity . leave or adoption leave’ for women having a child by a surrogate. Ruling: The European Court of Justice has denied two women who became parents through a surrogate mother the right to maternity leave (file picture) At present a British employer does not have to give paid maternity leave to someone who has a baby through a surrogate arrangement and the EU ruling backed this up. The ECJ stated that there is no law governing this aspect of maternity leave - but left the door open for member states to address this loophole. The UK government is doing just that by modifying the Children & Families Act. As Emma Burrows, Head of Employment at law firm Trowers & Hamlins, said, 'surrogacy arrangements are already on the cards', with intended parents in surrogacy arrangements becoming entitled to flexible parental leave and pay when reforms come in in spring 2015. She added that 'the rights to adoption leave and pay mirror those of maternity leave and pay'. However, from next April, UK mothers who . have children through surrogacy will be able to claim broadly . equivalent maternity leave, despite the ECJ's ruling. The ruling highlights a loophole in maternity laws that EU countries are free to address. The ECJ said that member states are 'free to apply more favourable rules for the benefit of commissioning mothers' - and the UK's Children & Families Act is being modified from April 2015 so that those who 'commission' a birth have the same maternity rights as the birth mother. Karen Bexley, Legal Director of Employment at Millbank Edge, told MailOnline that UK laws can differ from EU laws, as long as they meet the minimum standard set out by European judges. She said: ‘The UK government implements European laws with its own UK legislation, which should be no less favourable than an individual’s European employment rights. The UK often “gold-plates” European employment rights by going beyond the European minimum requirements. In such cases an individual would rely on their more generous UK rights and seek enforcement of such rights within UK courts. ‘The UK government, within the Children’s And Families Act from April 2015, is trying to address loopholes such as the rights of parents in surrogacy arrangements, as well as making changes to the law to recognise modern day family relationships for example the introduction of shared parental leave.’ The ECJ was considering two cases: one of a British woman who worked for an NHS Foundation trust, Ms D, who could not get pregnant and had a child, fathered by her husband but carried by another woman and using another woman's egg. Flexible: From next April, UK mothers who have children through surrogacy will be able to claim maternity leave . The husband and wife were subsequently given full parental rights over the child with the consent of the surrogate mother. She initially took her case to a tribunal in Newcastle upon Tyne, claiming discrimination under the Equality Act 2010, but that ruled in 2011 that the birth mother has the right to maternity leave, not her. In the second case, a teacher in Ireland, Ms Z, who was fertile but had no uterus, used a surrogate mother in California. She and her husband were the child's full biological parents and recognised as such under US law. In both cases, however, when the women asked for maternity leave so as to look after their babies, their employers turned them down on the grounds that neither had gone through a pregnancy or adopted their children. Reviewing the cases against EU legislation on conditions for working mothers, fair treatment and physical handicap, the court said it could find no grounds to say that such a refusal of maternity leave breached EU law. Marian Bloodworth, an employment partner at Berwin Leighton Paisner, told The Guardian: ‘The ECJ's narrow interpretation that only birth mothers get maternity leave goes counter to the prevailing trend in the UK, which is to recognise the importance of intended mothers, whether through surrogacy or adoption, to have time off from work in order to allow them to bond with their new baby or child.' Vanessa Hogan, an employment lawyer at Hogan Lovell, said that advances in medical technology mean surrogacy is more common than ever, but that the law hasn’t moved with the times. The rights to adoption leave mirror those of maternity leave.","European Court of Justice says maternity leave must go to birth mother .

Despite backing from Levy in the highly-charged meeting, they are short-term guarantees and Villas-Boas knows he could be sacked at a moment's notice. The Spurs chairman is already sounding out potential replacements.

Fabio Capello, who was at White Hart Lane on Sunday performing TV . duties, out-of-work Gus Hiddink and Glenn Hoddle and three high-profile . names in the frame. However, Villas-Boas pledged not to resign, despite admitting he has never faced a . worse home loss in his career than the drubbing at the hands of Brendan Rodgers' rampant Reds. Liverpool captain Luis Suarez ran wild at White Hart Lane, scoring twice and having a hand in the goals for Jordan Henderson, John Flanagan and Raheem Sterling. And the Portuguese refused to give up on a top-four Premier League finish. Asked how much time he would be given at Spurs, Villas-Boas said: 'That's the only thing I can't control, it's not my call so I can't say anything else. 'I have to get down to work, that's the only thing I can focus on. 'The call to make that decision is not mine, because obviously I won't resign and I'm not a quitter.

'And because of the expressive result it makes it even more difficult for us to bounce back.' Villas-Boas . offered no argument with defeat, but felt Paulinho's second-half red . card allowed Liverpool to pile on the goals, and the misery. Confirming he would try to appeal that red card, Villas-Boas labelled the decision 'an extremely poor call'. He said: 'I think it was a bit harsh because I don't think there was intention to hurt Suarez. 'His . foot was high, definitely a yellow card, but a straight red I think is a . bit too much, because Paulinho is not that type of player. 'I think it was an extremely poor call that has an influence, not on the victory of Liverpool but on the expressive result.

'He was great in the changing room, I told him a few days back I wanted him to lead this club and that it was an honour for him. 'I think he enjoyed it and today you've seen his performance level.' Hailing his side's dominance in every area, Rodgers said: 'I loved their arrogance with the ball today. 'They were a real threat with the ball all day.

Nathan Baxendale was shamed into turning himself in - less than 48 hours after pulling off the bank raid . A bank robber has been jailed after his poorly planned caper turned him into an online laughing stock and forced him to turn himself in. Nathan Baxendale, 21, surrendered to police less than 48 hours after pulling off the bank job because his failure to wear a disguise while committing the crime made evading capture impossible. Baxendale strode into a branch of the Co-op bank in Bury, Greater Manchester, last month and handed staff a note saying: 'Give me your money, I have a gun.' Hailing a taxi to make his getaway with £2,000 in cash, Baxendale thought he had escaped cleanly. However, by not concealing his identity, the hapless criminal made it easy for police to obtain clear pictures of him from the bank's high quality CCTV system. Only hours later, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) had Baxendale's identity after Facebook users recognised him from the CCTV images, posted by the force on the social networking site. Comments written below the photos were less than kind to Baxendale, branding him an 'idiot', a 'plonker', and a 'fool'. Officers turned up at Baxendale's mother's house and, while he was not home, he handed himself in the very next day - less than 48 hours after the bank raid had taken place. He later admitted to committing the crime to pay drug debts and buy clothes. He appeared at Bolton Crown Court on Monday admitting to robbery and was sentenced to three years and four months behind bars. Detective Sargent Ian Partington said: 'This was an extremely bizarre incident for which there was only ever going to be one outcome. By failing to hide his identity, Baxendale made it very easy for police to trace him using CCTV footage . 'Baxendale . walked into the bank bold as brass, made no attempt to conceal his . identity and made what the cashier believed was a credible and . terrifying threat.

'I would also like to thank the public for their assistance in identifying Baxendale and helping us to expedite our inquiries. 'Since . the appeal was issued on social networking sites, we had an . overwhelming response and as a result of comments and information left . on GMP’s Facebook site, we made an arrest.

In the Channel 4 documentary, Undercover Doctor: Cure Me I’m Gay, openly gay Dr Jessen explores the various controversial methods being deployed in the UK and US to ‘cure’ gay patients. These include 'aversion therapy' in UK and 'gay rehab' in the US. Scroll down for video .

Dr Jessen is shown pictures of naked men whilst being given syrup to make him vomit, shown in C4's Cure Me I'm Gay . Dr Jessen is seen vomiting after during his 'Aversion Therapy' in C4#s documentary, Cure Me I'm Gay . We see Dr Jessen given bottle of ipecac syrup to drink, to make him vomit for hours while looking at pictures of naked men and listening to tapes telling him he is ‘worthless,’ that being gay was evil and that he should want to have sex with women. This ‘shock therapy’ used to be deployed by doctors for treating homosexuality, ‘since probably the 1920s, 30, 40s and going on well into the 1970s and 80s,’ Dr Jessen tells Mail Online. Patients were given injections every two hours which would make them vomit and have diarrhoea. The theory was that, afterwards, seeing images of naked men or having homosexual thoughts, would cause a physical reaction. No patients claimed to be cured by this method. ‘I can’t believe that people like me – a doctor – would actually prescribe this to people like me – gay,’ Dr Jessen told This Morning. The documentary then shows Dr Jessen visit the southern states of America, known as the Bible Belt.

Some in these deeply religious areas believe that being gay is a state of mind - one that can be treated. ‘The most shocking thing, was that these religious leaders do not believe we were born gay, but that  it’s a condition caused by childhood trauma,’ says Dr Jessen in the documentary. Worried about how these views would affect young people, Dr Jessen contacted many Evangelistic churches within the Bible Belt, but they refused to grant him interviews. Instead, he spoke to young church-goers outside the building to ask their views. We see him speak to various teenagers, who stated that being gay is a ‘state of mind.’ Two teenage girls, aged 16 and 20, explain that being gay ‘happens when bad spirits are inside you. Demons.’ Dr Jessen is visibly upset by this. ‘Imagine being gay and being told that?’ he says, before crying in frustration. ‘I think you should get me out of here, I’ve had enough,’ he says to the camera crew before walking away. ‘I’d . been doing reasonably well before then, keeping myself together and . regarding all of this as just nonsense,’ Dr Jessen tell Mail Online. ‘Rather stupidly, I thought younger people must share different views and I hoped to see some open-mindedness. ‘It saddened me deeply that this wasn’t the case. ‘They don’t come up with these ideas themselves, they are taught them, and that’s incredibly worrying. ‘They go to schools where creationism is taught over evolution, it’s unbelievable.’ During ‘right brain therapy,’ Dr Jessen went undercover, posing as ‘Adrian’, a . gay man who wanted to be cured. He visited Jerry Mungadze, an ex-church pastor, who claims to be a doctor. However, as Dr Jessen found out, . Mungadze has no medical qualifications beyond a minor degree in psychology. His . ‘right brain therapy,’ which costs $250, claims to spot how gay the . patient actually is, and why, by getting them to colour in a drawing of a . brain. Jerry Mungadze, an ex-church pastor, claims to be a doctor but, as Dr Jessen found out, has no medical qualifications beyond a minor degree in psychology. Dr Jessen watches videos of Jerry Mungadze, amazed at his 'Right Brain Therapy' theories which he deems as 'nonsense' Posing as ‘Adrian,’ Dr Jessen did this, with no prior medical consultation from Mungadze, who even admitted to being colour blind. ‘Adrian’ had to describe which part of the drawing he had filled in which colour. ‘He told me the parts I’d drawn in black symbolised all the abuse I’d had as a child,’ says Dr Jessen. ‘Which is odd because I had a happy childhood and a lovely relationship with my parents.’ Unbelievably, we see Mungadze tell ‘Adrian’ that the thyroid gland (the gland located in your neck) and the adrenal gland (located above the kidney) are both located in the brain. ‘What a load of absolute nonsense,’ says Dr Jessen. ‘It’s damaging because people watch his videos and actually think you can retrain the brain.’ Dr Jessen also investigated ‘gay rehab.’ Dr Jessen visits John Smid, who is now openly gay, but for years was married and living in denial. Smid used to run a rehabilitation programme for gay men before he accepted his sexuality and retired in 2007. 'As with drug or alcohol rehabilitation, the rehab attempts to completely isolate the patient from his addiction,’ explains Dr Jessen. In C4's documentary Undercover Doctor: Cure Me I'm Gay, Dr Jessen is tested at Cornell University in New York to confirm that he is, in fact, '100% gay.' Wires are connected to Dr Jessen during an experiment at Cornell University in New York to test his levels of homosexuality . For $3,000 a month, Smid’s three-month Love In Action programme would ‘take the patient away from anything he deemed gay,’ such as clothes and music. Smid then talks Dr Jessen through 'gay rehab', as if he were still conducting the course, rifling through his suitcase and discarding anything that might 'cause us to feel sensual or sexual.' Sorting through Dr Jessen’s CDs, Smid claims that music ‘rises up the senses,’ so he should only listen to ‘Christian music.’ Smid says his Mozart CD would be identified as ‘not Christian,’ and his Adele CD would be seen as equally inappropriate, as the singer is popular within the gay community. Smid himself now admits: 'I’ve never met a man who experienced a change from homosexual to heterosexual.' Dr Jessen says that he hopes the documentary raises awareness and helps the gay community feel more assured. ‘I hope young, vulnerable people who perhaps may have considered these therapies will watch the programme and realise it’s all nonsense and they have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of,’ he says. Undercover Doctor: Cure Me I’m Gay is on Channel 4 tonight at 10pm .","Embarrassing Bodies Dr Jessen goes undercover in C4 documentary .

Councils should charge residents for bin collections and other services - even if it is ‘painful’ for them, a Government minster suggested yesterday. Education minister David Laws insisted local authorities should be encouraged to ‘take responsibility for themselves’ and ensure they are less dependent on funding from central government. A third of councils in England now charge to collect garden waste - with one of the highest fees found in Kingston-upon-Thames, south-west London, where it is £75 a year for green wheelie bins. Charge for bin collections: Education minister David Laws insisted local authorities should be encouraged to 'take responsibility for themselves' and ensure they are less dependent on funding from central government . According to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Laws told MPs on the public administration select committee: ‘There are some local authorities that, because the central government grant has been cut or frozen, are seeking to raise more money from those areas that are more under their control locally.’ The Liberal Democrat added: ‘I'm sure that's not the vision that every local authority would want because that involves some painful decisions for them locally which are not always popular. ‘But it seems to me that type of trend through whichever route is one which we ought to be seeking to encourage in future, so that local authorities can take a degree of responsibility for themselves rather than constantly looking to central government.’ It comes after the Mail revealed on Monday how Eric Pickles had threatened to introduce new laws forcing councils to bring back weekly bin collections after admitting the Government’s previous efforts have done no more than slow the decline. Bin men at work: A third of councils across England now charge to collect garden waste (file picture) The Communities Secretary said it had taken Labour ten years to ‘destroy’ the traditional weekly service and suggested it would take as long to restore it. Councils should also be forced to publicise when long-running contracts with waste firms are up for renewal, giving voters a chance to demand a return to a weekly service, he said. A BBC survey in July 2012 found a third of England's councils charge to collect garden waste. That followed a Mail survey in June 2011 that found nearly one in four councils was charging to collect garden waste. Of 267 councils that responded to a poll, 64 charged for a collection service. As well as Kingston-upon-Thames, other councils who have introduced charges for collecting bins include Wokingham in Berkshire, South Kesteven in Lincolnshire and Kirklees in West Yorkshire.","David Laws: Local authorities should 'take responsibility for themselves'

A high-profile bank boss has been cleared of killing a van driver in a head-on crash after he fell asleep at the wheel and drifted into oncoming traffic. Gordon Soutar, 50, an operations director at Virgin Money, was yesterday cleared of causing death by dangerous driving and the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving at Newcastle Crown Court. Mr Soutar told jurors he had been suffering from undiagnosed sleep apnoea at the time of the collision and must have been having a ‘micro sleep’ while at the wheel - causing the crash. Cleared: Virgin Money operations director Gordon Soutar was cleared of causing the death of a van driver in a head-on crash in Northumberland . The accident took place on the A1 Felton bypass on the single-carriageway section in Northumberland at 7.30am on November 12, 2012. Eyewitnesses said that Mr Soutar’s white BMW 520 - which costs around £32,000 brand new and had its own personalised numberplate - drifted into oncoming traffic on a single carriageway stretch of the road, colliding with Nigel Sowerby 37, who was driving a VW caddy van. Mr Sowerby from Cleckheaton in West Yorkshire was airlifted to Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary by Great North Air Ambulance but died as a result of his injuries. During the trial, Mr Soutar said he could not remember anything about the accident and  tests after the fatal crash revealed he had the sleeping condition. The court also heard from Dr Tom Mackay, a sleep specialist and director of the sleep centre at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, who first saw Mr Soutar in January 2013. He said that he had diagnosed the bank boss with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in April 2013. The sleep disorder involves the person involuntarily holding their breath for a number of seconds at a time while asleep before the brain realises and sparks the breathing process again. It prevents the sufferer from being able to reach the crucial stages of deep sleep. The condition can lead to micro-sleeps, when the person undergoes short periods of inattention – from fragments of a second to about ten seconds – and it is this that Soutar claims was happening to him on the morning of his crash. Jurors took 90 minutes to acquit the Virgin Money boss of any wrongdoing after a week-long trial at Newcastle Crown Court. Mr Soutar expressed his regret over the accident and told the court he prays for his alleged victim’s family every day. Turning . to face Mr Sowerby’s family he said: ‘If I could address the family. It . has been 16 months since that very tragic accident and there has not . been a day that has passed when I have not thought about the family. Crash site: The accident took place on the A1 Felton bypass on the single-carriageway in Northumberland . ‘I pray for them every day. Whatever happens after this they will always be in my thoughts.’ Mr Soutar, a married father-of-three and grandfather started off as an office junior with Bank of Scotland then worked his way up the ranks to senior management level. He said he had been head-hunted by RBS and also worked for Capita before joining Virgin Money in April 2012. Driving: Mr Soutar's white  BMW 520, (which was similar to this one) costs around £32,000 brand new . At the time of the accident he had 640 people working for him in Newcastle, Edinburgh and Norwich. He was doing his usual Monday morning commute in his BMW from his home in Scotland to Virgin Money’s office Gosforth in November 2012. Mr Soutar said his last memory of the journey was passing a supermarket in Berwick and the next thing he remembers is coming round in the car after the crash, himself seriously injured. He told how since the accident he had been getting the train to work in Newcastle and now does limited driving and always with his wife beside him. He said: ‘I always have my wife in the car now for comfort. It may be a confidence thing. It’s a big shock and a big scare to be involved in such a serious accident.’ The bank boss, of Cairneyhill, Dunfermline, was heading south while Mr Sowerby, from West Yorkshire, was in his works van with his colleague going north. Mr . Sowerby’s family laid him to rest at All Saints’ Church, Misterton on . Tuesday 27th November at 12.00 noon in what was described as a . ‘celebration of his life.’ He . left behind his mother Carol, father Phillip, sister Jo and brother in . law Harvey.

Getting more parents out to work with up to £2,000 a year in childcare subsidies for every child will be ‘good for the economy’, David Cameron said last night. The Prime Minister said the scheme, details of which will be confirmed in today’s Budget, was not about ‘pushing people into a particular choice’. His comments came after some Tory MPs complained the handout will only be available to couples in which both parents work, discriminating against stay-at-home mothers and fathers. Boost? David Cameron, pictured at a nursery school yesterday announcing the policy, said the scheme will be 'good for the economy' But Mr Cameron suggested there was an economic reason for targeting two-earner families, saying: ‘I think it’ll make a big difference to families across the country, it’ll be good for them and good for the economy too.’ Under the scheme, couples will be able to open new online ‘tax-free childcare’ accounts, to be run by HM Revenue & Customs, and National Savings & Investments. Any money paid in to them will attract a 20 per cent subsidy from the Government. The accounts can then be used to pay any registered childcarer. It is not technically tax relief, because people will pay in using taxed income and it is not administered through the tax system. But the 20 per cent top-up means that effectively, participants will have their basic rate tax refunded, and this is why Treasury has called the scheme ‘tax-free childcare’. Labour branded the scheme ‘an au pair subsidy’, because it will be available to families earning as much as £300,000 a year. The inclusion of couples earning up to the top 45p tax band – £150,000 each – is seen as an attempt to assuage Tory MPs calling for action on the 40p tax band to help squeezed middle-class professionals. Working parents: David and Samantha Cameron won't qualify for the new subsidy . The Prime Minister insisted other measures were being brought in to help stay-at-home parents, including 15 hours of free childcare for three- and four-year-olds. But former Conservative children’s minister Tim Loughton said further measures would be necessary to avoid penalising stay-at-home parents. ‘One-earner married couples make great sacrifices to save the state the cost of bringing up their own children and deserve a level playing field,’ he said. There were also doubts about the administration of the scheme, which will open in autumn next year and benefit an estimated 1.9million families. Last night the Institute for Fiscal Studies expressed concern about how officials will police a system in which one member of a couple only has to earn £50 a week in order to qualify. It said it appeared people would ‘only need to self-certify that they are earning more than £50 a week’. ‘There will be a very large incentive for some second earners to claim they are earning that much: it could be worth thousands of pounds in childcare subsidy,’ it said. Critics also questioned the coherence of removing child benefit from higher earners, only to give them similar sums back in the form of childcare tax breaks. Lucy Powell, Labour’s childcare spokesman, said: ‘The Government is implying everyone will be £2,000 a year better off. But for the average family it will be less than £500. It will be only those with the highest childcare costs, like expensive nannies, who will get the full amount.’ Mr Cameron said: ‘We chose the cut-off point at the higher rate of tax, because if you set these schemes at different levels, it becomes more form-filling, more complications. This is targeted at couples when they’re working hard and struggling to pay childcare bills.’ He and Mr Clegg indicated they would not claim the allowance. It is thought their family incomes are likely to breach the earnings threshold. Anand Shukla, of the Family and Childcare Trust, welcomed the move, saying: ‘An investment in childcare is an investment both in our economy and in our future.’ A Treasury spokesman insisted the system would not be abused: ‘The tax-free childcare registration process includes checks to ensure that parents are eligible and further checks will be made on their quarterly updates.’","David Cameron said new policy will help get parents into work .

Neil Carmichael has criticised the 'unacceptable' figures, saying they should be a 'cause for alarm' Too many people are undergoing 'unnecessary' leg amputations due to a lack of proper treatment, MPs and peers have warned. A new report revealed a postcode lottery in the number of people losing legs for diseases including diabetes, with amputation twice as likely for those in the south west compared to those in London. In 2012/2013, there were almost 12,000 lower limb amputations in England, a figure the report said remains 'stubbornly high'. The new study from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Vascular Disease is based on Freedom of Information requests to NHS trusts and NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). It argued there is a lack of planning of how to treat patients at risk of lower limb disease, with CCGs in areas without a dedicated patient pathway - a treatment plan agreed between departments - having 11 per cent more amputations on average than those with one. Almost a third of NHS trusts handling vascular and diabetes patients did not have multi-disciplinary teams to manage care, despite evidence they produce better results. Some 28 per cent of trusts also lacked the teams for peripheral arterial disease, a common condition in which fatty deposits in the arteries stop blood getting to leg muscles. Tory MP Neil Carmichael said: 'Too many patients aren't getting the treatment they need to avoid losing their legs.

'For someone with diabetes, getting the right foot care is essential. This includes having an annual foot check and being referred to a foot protection service if you are at increased risk of a foot attack. 'Up to 80% of amputations are avoidable with good preventative footcare in the community and fast access to a specialist multidisciplinary team when needed. 'Diabetes UK is calling on the NHS to ensure that people with diabetes and health care professionals recognise the importance of addressing acute foot care problems quickly and that there are services in place to ensure that people can access the right care at the right time.'","Report shows there were 12,000 NHS lower limb amputations in 2012/13 .

A woman, aged 29, was arrested and questioned by police who arrived at the scene, but has now been released on bail. Police say there are currently treating the death as 'unexplained' and the boy's heartbroken family are being supported by a specialist team. Woodmansey Parish Council chairman Councillor Kerri Harold said: 'This will shock everyone. It is a close-knit community and I'm sure everyone will be devastated.

A notorious Mafia fugitive who has been on the run from Italian justice for two decades let his mask slip yesterday as he attended a London police station. On Monday, Domenico 'The Professor' Rancadore, 65, who has been on Italy's most-wanted list since 1994, won his fight to avoid extradition after a judge ruled that overcrowded jails there would breach his human rights. Rancadore, who fled Italy, where he ran a powerful, armed branch of the Mafia, for the west London suburb of Uxbridge, covered his face when he left court afterwards. Domenico Rancadore, 65, showed his face when he reported to Uxbridge police station with his wife yesterday . But yesterday he let his guard slip as he reported to a police station near his house, showing his face in public for the first time. Despite pulling his anorak hood around his face on the bright spring day, his face and instantly recognisable large nose were clearly visible as he walked out arm in arm with his wife, Anne. The father of two, who lives in a modest bungalow and is known to neighbours as Marc Skinner, was known as a mob godfather in his native Italy, where he ran one of the most dangerous factions of the Mafia. According to former prison chaplain Father Gino Sacchetti, Rancadore’s Cosa Nostra mob in Palermo's Trabia district was responsible for a series of a sickening attacks in a campaign of intimidation including nailing a dead lamb to his front door, firebombing his car and posting bullets to him. Fearing the net was closing in after his accomplices were arrested, Rancadore fled to London for a new life in 1994 where he set himself up as a chauffeur driving celebrities in expensive cars. He lived there quietly with his wife, adopting her English mother's surname Skinner, and their children Giuseppe, 36, and Daniela, 33. Under wraps: Rancadore and his wife, Anne, covered their faces with scarves when they left court on Monday . Hiding: The once-feared Mafia boss went to great lengths to disguise his identity outside court on Monday . But despite 20 years of living under the radar, he was arrested by Scotland Yard last August and taken to Westminster Magistrates' Court, where a lawyer for the Italian government called for him to be extradited to serve the prison sentence he was given in his absence in 1999. On Monday, however, Senior District Judge Howard Riddle ruled that Rancadore could not be extradited because cramped prison conditions would breach his human rights. The judge's hands were tied by a High Court ruling last week when judges decided a Somalian businessman accused of unauthorised financial activity could not be sent to Italy due to a Strasbourg judgement that Italian prisons violated Article 3 of the Human Rights Act that prevents torture, inhuman or degrading treatment.

Diddy, Tupac and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, but the majority of guests at this ‘Manhattan hot spot’ are not dropping in voluntarily, and there certainly is no VIP section. As well as Rockefeller Center, The Empire State Building and Central Park, New York City tourists are now adding Manhattan Criminal Court to their must-see list. The ‘night court’ is a chance for tourists to see real life U.S. law-and-order in action, portrayed in numerous television shows and films. Tourist attraction: Visitors are flocking to to Manhattan Criminal Court in New York to see law-and-order in action during the 5pm to 1am night session in the court . Famous bookings: Both former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn (left) and rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs (right)  have appeared at Manhattan Criminal Court - Combs in 1999 and Strauss-Kahn in 2011 . The court on lower Manhattan handles dozens of cases in the late hours, a practice which is attracting a rising number of tourists. Manhattan Criminal Court handles more than 100,000 arrests a year, averaging about 70 to 90 cases during the 5pm-1am night session. It is one of New York's more peculiar and paradoxical tourist traditions, a place visitors extol on travel websites while many residents hope never to wind up there. To travelers, it is a form of gritty entertainment, hard-knocks education or at least a chance to experience real-life law and order on a New York scale. Dozens of jurisdictions nationwide hold nightly court sessions, but thanks to television series such as Law & Order and Night Court, as well as arraignments of real-life celebrities, from rapper Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs to former child actress Amanda Bynes, Manhattan Criminal has become famous in its own right. No model behaviour: Supermodel Naomi Campbell is escorted from Manhattan Criminal Court in 2007 after pleading guilty to assaulting her housekeeper with a mobile phone . Hairspray-ed: Actress Amanda Bynes made some interesting sartorial choices for her court appearance on on reckless endangerment charges . 'It's very interesting to hear real cases,’ Jenny Baumann, a 26-year-old tourist from Munich, Germany, said as she watched judge decide whether to set bail for people facing charges ranging from choking a girlfriend to stealing a six-pack of beer. Each case is handled in a matter of minutes amid a hive of clerks shuffling paperwork, police taking retinal scans, defendants and lawyers conferring in a confessional-sized glass booth and court officers occasionally bellowing, ‘Quiet, please!’ Established in 1907, Manhattan night court once attracted such spectators as John D. Rockefeller and the then-Duke of Manchester. More recently, it's been noted in tour books, including a mention in the off-the-beaten-path Lonely Planet guide. ‘This is something that feels really underground and unique,’ said Regis St. Louis, author of the current Lonely Planet New York book. Night court is so popular that veteran clerk Robert Smith has become an impromptu tour guide for school groups from as far away as Denmark, judges from Japan and individual sightseers he spots in the audience. ‘I try to make it informative’ by explaining the process, he says. ‘It is a ""just-off-Broadway show"" with a cast of thousands, ever-changing story lines ... real drama, as well as occasional comic relief,’ said Edward McCarthy, who oversees the Legal Aid Society's defense work there. But if it can be entertaining to watch, it's fraught and serious work,acting State Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson, the Criminal Court's supervising judge from 2008 through 2012 says. ‘From the judge's perspective and all of the attorneys' who work so hard, there's nothing amusing about it,’ she said. ‘And the stakes are very high.’ Some court tourists are legal workers or law students seeking to educate themselves about New York's justice system, or parents or who want to teach their children about it. Adam Jory Waxman and his wife took their 16-year-old son there last month while visiting from the Atlanta area, hoping it would be a lesson in choices and consequences. And it was. ‘He saw that people got themselves in trouble and that there wasn't anything they could do about it until a judge made a decision,’ Waxman said. After two hours in Manhattan night court, Baumann came away determined to observe a court back in Germany. As she left, Holly Young was in the midst of her own first visit to the Manhattan court, waiting for a friend's arraignment. Go there for fun? She shook her head. ‘That's not something I would want to do,’ she said. ‘I don't think this is cool at all.’","Tourists are flocking to Manhattan Criminal Court in New York .

Jack Warner, the former vice-president of the governing body, was reportedly paid £720,000 from a company run by an ex-Qatari football official weeks after the winner was announced. Mr Warner was one of 22 people who decided to award the World Cup finals to Qatar . His sons - Daryll and Daryan - also received payments totalling £450,000, while one of his employees was paid a further £240,000, according to documents seen by the Daily Telegraph. The payments to Mr Warner appear to come from a company called Kemco which is owned by Mohamed Bin Hammam, an ex-member of Qatar's Fifa committee. Allegations: Former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner (left) was reportedly paid £720,000 by a firm run by ex-Qatari football official Mohamed Bin Hammam (right) shortly after the country's successful World Cup bid . Claims: Mr Warner had allegedly requested the £720,000 payment for work carried out between 2005 and 2010 in a note dated December 15, 2010 - two weeks after Qatar won the World Cup bid . Well connected: Warner sits next to Fifa President Michel Platini during the 2022 World Cup announcement. Mr Warner was one of 22 people who decided to award the World Cup to Qatar .

The crimes of North Korea’s regime are as chilling as those of the Nazis, claims the head of a UN inquiry. In a report based on testimony from hundreds of victims and defectors, investigators said North Korean security chiefs and even Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un should face international justice. The use of systematic torture, starvation, and killings is akin to punishments ordered under Adolf Hitler, the report stated. Scroll down for video . Condemnation: Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un should face international justice, the UN report's author said . However, China has rubbished the report, sparking fears that the nation's veto could derail attempts to tackle the crisis. Launching the scathing 400-page report in Geneva today, chief author and former judge Michael Kirby told a UN forum: 'Contending . with the scourges of Nazism, apartheid, the Khmer Rouge and other . affronts required courage by great nations and ordinary human beings . alike. 'It is now your solemn duty to address the scourge . of human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic . People's Republic of Korea.' He . demanded closure of political prison camps believed to hold up to . 120,000 people, and action by the International Criminal Court (ICC). But Chen Chuandong, a counsellor at China's mission in Geneva, told the U.N. Human Rights Council that the independent commission of inquiry had made unfounded accusations and recommendations that were 'divorced from reality'. 'The inability of the commission to get support and cooperation from the country concerned makes it impossible for the commission to carry out its mandate in an impartial, objective and effective manner,' Chen said. China, as a member of the U.N. Security Council, would have the power to veto any move to refer North Korea to the Hague-based ICC. The report blasts the nation's use of systematic torture as akin to Nazism, apartheid and the Khmer Rouge . Diplomats had already warned China was likely to object to the report, which also criticised Beijing for its treatment of North Korean defectors. Despite the setback, Mr Kirby said he was convinced North Korea's leadership would eventually face the ICC for crimes documented in the commission's archives, which hold the testimonies of hundreds of witnesses. 'I have lived long enough to see things that looked impossible come to full fruit,' Kirby told a news conference. 'The independence of East Timor, the independence of the Baltic states and other steps following the fall of the Berlin Wall are all indications that things can happen that don't look certain now. 'They won't meet media deadlines but they will occur.' The forum, which commissioned the unprecedented investigation a year ago, will decide on how to handle North Korea at a session lasting until March 28. Setback: China, which was also condemned in the report, rubbished the findings as 'divorced from reality' Campaigners have hailed the report, and urged international leaders to take action. 'The fact that these violations are now deemed to be crimes against humanity triggers the responsibility of the international community to respond,' said Julie de Rivero of Human Rights Watch. 'It might be a long route but steps need to be taken.' So far, the U.N. Security Council has focused only on North Korea's nuclear weapons and proliferation threat, she added. 'We are advocating that the Security Council needs to deal with crimes in North Korea.' Roseann Rife of Amnesty International said in a statement: 'This is the first real test of the international community to show it is serious about acting on the Commission of Inquiry's chilling findings. 'There needs to a concerted effort to ratchet up the pressure on the North Korean government to address these systematic, widespread and grave human rights violations.'","Chief author blasted nation's torture 'contending with scourges of Nazism'

A seaside 'land train' run by the same family for 46 years has been scrapped by a local council, so it can instead put its own trains on the route. The novelty attraction near Bournemouth - thought to be the first of its kind in the country - was hand-built in 1968 by Roger Faris and is still run by his 88-year-old widow Joyce. But more than 17,000 people have protested after Bournemouth Borough Council told the pensioner it would not renew her licence for the three motorised trains in November. Outrage: Joyce Faris, 88 (pictured) has been told she will no longer be able to run the 'land trains' introduced by her late husband 46 years ago - so Bournemouth Borough Council can run its own service instead . Hitting the buffers: The council told Mrs Faris its decision is final despite a petition signed by thousands . Popular: The train runs every hour at Mudeford beach, pictured, which has 350 upmarket beach huts . All aboard: Mrs Faris employs five drivers and a mechanic on her set of three novelty land trains . Instead the council will run its own 'land trains' on the one-and-a-half mile path from Hengistbury Head to Mudeford beach in Dorset. The council claims its trains will be better because they will have 50 per cent more seats, disabled access and modern engines with lower emissions. They will also eventually run directly along a six-mile route from the beauty spot to Bournemouth seafront, once they link up with the trains the council already runs. But fans of the current trains, which have eight carriages each, criticised the 'insensitive' news - which was delivered to Mrs Faris on the same day her grandson died. A petition calling on the council to keep the current service, which locals affectionately nicknamed the Noddy train in 1960s as an adaptation of its original name of 'toy town train', has gained more than 17,000 signatures in a few days. It was also given a mention by BBC breakfast radio presenter Chris Evans today, who said: 'I just feel sorry for the Noddy Train and the people that run it and the kids that enjoy it.' History: Joyce Faris with her late husband Roger with one of their trains in the 1970s. She said the train was her 'life' and she runs it more as a hobby than to turn any profit. There are fears that fares could go up . The first train, pictured when it launched, was built by Mr Faris with the help of driver Robert Jowitt, pictured. Cheery: The hand-built trains, pictured in 1977, were thought to be the first of their kind in the country . The good old days: An early version of the train when its engine more resembled a ride-on lawnmower . Despite the council promising to freeze fares at their current level for the next year, day trippers . fear they will then rise sharply so the authority can turn a profit. Mrs Faris - who employs five drivers and a mechanic - said she makes almost no money from the trains, which she runs every half hour charging £1.20 for an adult one-way ticket. A full-day fare on the council's . trains costs £5 or £18 for a family. However, a spokesman said a one-way . ticket on the same route would be frozen for a year. Support: BBC breakfast radio presenter Chris Evans said he felt sorry for the train staff . Mrs Faris said: 'I had no idea they were planning this. I thought the council were going to renew the contract like they do every year. 'I wasn’t in a very good state at the time because I found out my grandson had died and I told the people from the council that but they went ahead with the meeting. 'I couldn’t take it in at and I wasn’t ready for it and just agreed with them. 'I don’t have the words to describe how I am feeling. Really it’s just disgraceful and a total shock. 'The train is my life and I have run it more as a hobby than a business. 'The current profit margins are such that you would have to have another job because you can’t make a living out of it.' Alan Barnard, 51, who has been the . land train mechanic for 22 years, said: 'If the council aren’t shamed by . this they ought to be. I feel we have been stabbed in the back. 'Someone who has spent 45 years working with them deserves more respect than has been shown here.' He said Mrs Faris had continued investing in the trains, replacing the carriages and buying new parts as recently as last year. 'The . council say they'll offer us a transfer but I'll refuse out of . principle,' he told MailOnline. 'They can offer me whatever they want . but I'm not joining them. 'It's . fantastic that we've had so much support but I don't think the council . will change their mind. They've done things despite public protests . before.' Iconic: The train has been a Bournemouth tourist attraction for 46 years and features in postcards . Scenic: Another postcard shows the train on a summer's day while holidaymakers ride animals alongside . Affectionate: The origins of the Noddy train's nickname came when it was originally named a 'toy town train'. Its official name is the Hengistbury Head land train . Scenic: The train carries passengers to the pedestrian-only beach at Mudeford Spit, pictured . Devoted: Mrs Faris still runs the service along this stretch of coastline 364 days a year at the age of 88 . Mr Faris built the train after the . council called on people to find an alternative way of travelling to the . beauty spot, which was overrun with cars. His construction was believed to have been the first novelty land train in the country. The . engineer was granted a one year trial and the service was deemed so . successful he continued running it until his death in 1980. Mrs Faris then took over the running and still works in the office today. The train also takes visitors and the owners of 350 exclusive beach huts to the Mudeford sandbank. One resident posted on an internet forum: 'My family have been using the train for years. My mum went on it as a girl, I did and now my children. It is more valuable than numbers on a spreadsheet. 'It is also very disrespectful to the lady who has dedicated her life to running it. Where is the morality in this decision, some things are more important than money.' Happy memories: Roger and Joyce Faris, together far right, with staff members in the 1970s . On track: The train had a party to mark its 40th anniversary in 2008. Right, Mr and Mrs Faris in the 1970s . Derailed: Mrs Faris said she received the shocking news shortly after discovering her grandson had died . Bournemouth council's cabinet member . for tourism, Lawrence Williams, claimed Mrs Faris had agreed to the . closure and derided the online petition because those signing it had not . given their addresses. He told the Daily Echo: 'If they want us to take the petition . seriously, they should take the names and addresses of people who live . in Bournemouth, as we do not know where these people are from.' The council also denied its 5.5ft-wide trains will struggle to pass each other on the 10ft-wide path, and said rumours that the train will be branded by Disney are untrue. In a statement, he added: 'The existing land train service at . Hengistbury Head has served the area well for a number of years and I . would like to thank Mrs Faris for her dedicated work during this time. 'With . the current licence set to expire and after much consideration we feel . that the time is right for the council to take ownership of the . service.'","Roger Faris hand-built a 'land train' at Dorset's Mudeford beach in 1968 .

M.I.A.’s . legal team has responded to the demands by calling it an attempt to . ‘bully’ the artist, and accuse the sports organisation of ‘making an . example of her for daring to challenge the NFL’. Rude: The singer flipped her middle finger and mouthed 'I don't give a s***' at a cameraman during her appearance with Madonna . and Nicki Minaj at the 2012 sporting event . ‘The claim for restitution lacks any basis in law, fact, or logic,' the performer's response papers read. '[The] . continued pursuit of this proceeding is transparently an exercise by . the NFL intended solely to bully and make an example of Respondents for . daring to challenge NFL.' 1993 - The first controversial performance involving a Jackson sees The King of Pop stand motionless on stage for a full one minute and 13 seconds. 2004 - Now known as 'Nipplegate', the half-time show saw Michael's sister Janet suffer an infamous 'wardrobe malfunction' as she was performing with Justin Timberlake. Timberlake was supposed to rip off a part of Jackson's leather bustier to expose a red bra - but ended up showing the world Janet's naked breast for 9/16ths of a second. For this, CBS was fined $550,000 by the Federal Communications Commission. 2009 - Bruce Springsteen and the E Street band performs in Tampa, and The Boss crotch-slams a TV camera. 2013 - The New Orleans' Mercedes-Benz Superdome suffers a blackout after Beyonce's half-time performance when she reunited Destiny's Child. M.I.A. - real name Maya Arulpragasam - wasn't paid for her performance at the . 2012 event, but did have to enter an agreement acknowledging 'the great . value of the goodwill associated with the NFL and the tremendous public . respect and reputation for wholesomeness enjoyed by the NFL.' The . contract added 'all elements of performance, including without . limitation wardrobe, shall be consistent with such goodwill and . reputation.' The NFL filed . their complaint with the American Arbitration Association in March 2012, . despite broadcaster NBC and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) both saying they would take no further action. The . complaint calls the middle-finger an 'offensive gesture' which is 'in . flagrant disregard for the values that form the cornerstone of the NFL . brand and the Super Bowl.' The . singer - best known for the hit song Paper Planes - flipped her middle . finger and swore into the camera during her rap solo as over 100 million . fans around the world watched the performance. While . all eyes were on Madonna during the now infamous performance back in . 2012, broadcasters were caught by surprise by the singer and scrambled . to obscure the gesture in time. The screen briefly went blurry in . what seemed like a late attempt to cut out the camera shot and Madonna, . who at this point was lying on her back behind the rapper, appearing . blissfully unaware of the controversial move. The NFL, which produces the show, and the broadcaster, NBC, both apologised immediately but blamed each other for the incident. Fighting back: M.I.A's lawyer, Howard King, last week said that his client was planning to fight back against the NFL who imposed the fine . Brian McCarthy, the league's vice president of communications, said: 'There was a failure in NBC's delay system. 'The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans.' NBC's spokesperson countered: 'The NFL hired the talent and produced the half-time show. 'Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers.' Shortly after the performance, a source inside M.I.A.'s camp claimed the rapper was struck with 'a case of adrenaline and nerves.' 'She wasn't thinking,' said the source, who requested anonymity but was with the artist at Lucas Oil Stadium. 'It wasn't any kind of statement. 'She was caught in the moment and she's incredibly sorry.' The controversy mirrors that caused by Janet Jackson's 'wardrobe malfunction' during the 2004 show, which put CBS in hot water with the Federal Communications Commission. The singer was performing with Justin Timberlake when he ripped open her costume to expose her breast for nine-sixteenths of a second, a moment for which CBS was fined $550,000 by the FCC.","British artist M.I.A. raised her middle finger during 2012 Super Bowl show .

A Hollywood-style sign on a hillside overlooking Bristol which read 'BRISTOLAND' has been removed - after jokers re-arranged it to read 'IT'S BLAND'. The original sign - seen as a good advert for the area - mysteriously appeared overnight on the side of the picturesque Avon Gorge in January. But on Sunday night, jokers accessed the site and removed some letters before adding an apostrophe to produce the sign 'IT'S BLAND'. The original Hollywood-style sign became popular with locals after it appeared on the slopes in January . But the new feature has been removed after jokers rearranged the letters to spell out IT'S BLAND . The National Trust, which owns the site, then stepped in and removed all the letters on Monday because the new wording was considered 'inappropriate'. Head warden Bill Morris said: 'We can see the funny side of Bristoland, but we always said the sign had a finite life and the change to It's Bland was the point to remove it.' It is still not known who created the original sign or the altered one. Mr Morris added: 'I certainly wouldn't have liked to have put them up - it's a pretty steep slope so it would have been a difficult job. 'It was fun while it lasted and I hope they can come up with something new.' The original sign appeared on the slopes of the pretty Avon Gorge near Bristol in January . The original sign was hailed by organisers of the local arts festival, Upfest, after it mysteriously appeared on the hillside earlier this year. People in Bristol have hit back at claims their local area is boring. They proudly boast their city is 'the street . party capital of the UK' and was named one of the world’s top 10 cities to visit . according DK Eyewitness guides. Top attractions include Isambard . Kingdom Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, popular theatre the Hippodrome, . and the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The city has a history of guerilla public art - and is peppered with works by world-famous artist Banksy. Other well-known former residents include illusionist Derren Brown, model Sophie Anderton and TV chef Keith Floyd (above). It was fixed to mesh fencing halfway up a . rock face and the 8ft high letters became a familiar site to commuters . on the busy A4 Portway into the city. Upfest's Stephen Hayles, who was sent images of the original letters by street artists shortly after the word first appeared, hoped the sign would become permanent. He told MailOnline: 'I'm a little bit sad that it's gone, but that's the nature of art like this I suppose. 'Fair play to whoever got up there, as I'd have thought it was no mean feat. And fair play for putting the apostrophe in. 'I don't know what they were trying to say, whether they thought the original wording was bland or something else, because Bristol is definitely not a bland place.' The famous Hollywood sign in California was unveiled in 1923 and originally spelled out 'Hollywoodland', the name of a nearby housing development. Mr Hayles said his group are hoping to meet the National Trust to arrange a longer-lasting feature on the hillside site.","White-lettered 'BRISTOLAND' sign put up above Avon Gorge in January .

Passenger planes could soon be equipped with Star Wars-style lasers which would shoot down a terrorist's missiles. Israel's Ministry of Defence has announced that the SkyShield system developed by defence contractor Elbit Systems had successfully completed tests and has been certified for commercial use. SkyShield uses laser technology and a thermal camera to deflect incoming missiles - after a threat is detected it fires a laser to disrupt the missile's navigation system, taking it off course and detonating a safe distance from the aircraft. Scroll down for video . The SkyShield system (pictured) is based on advanced laser technology that deflects missiles fired at aircrafts . After detecting incoming missiles with an infrared sensor, it fires a laser that disrupts the missile's navigation system . It also operates completely automatically. The futuristic defence was first ordered in 2002 by the-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon after two shoulder-launched missiles were fired at an Israeli Boeing 757 as it took off from Moi International Airport in Mombassa, Kenya. The missiles both missed their target and none of the 250 passengers were hurt but the development of SkyShield was ordered as a direct result of the incident. The project was delayed for several years because of . infighting among defense firms and government agencies over . which one would foot the bill. The SkyShield system that protects passenger aircraft against shoulder-fired artillery (file photo) The SkyShield system was developed by Israeli defence contractor Elbit Systems to protect commercial airliners from surface-to-air missiles (file photo) Once the contract was awarded to Elbit . Systems, the project was completed in just three years. 'SkyShield has been validated under the . most complex and sophisticated testing conditions ever conducted in . Israel and is now ready to protect Israeli airlines,' Israel Air . Force Brigadier General Eitan Eshel, told wired.com. The system will now be installed on all El Al airliners but Elbit says it also has contracts with several other countries around the world. The approval of SkyShield comes just six weeks after another Israeli arms company revealed details of a ground-based laser defense system which can shoot missiles from the sky with a pulse of energy. State-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems said the futuristic military hardware called Iron Beam was almost ready for deployment. The futuristic defence was first ordered in 2002 by the-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon (pictured) after two shoulder-launched missiles were fired at an Israeli Boeing 757 as it took off from Moi International Airport in Mombassa, Kenya . It works by firing a focused laser at targets which are heated so rapidly they disintegrate in an instant. The arms maker publicised specifications of its High Energy Laser (HEL) at this week's Singapore Airshow, which is Asia's largest aerospace and defense exhibition. 'It's exactly like what you see in Star Wars,' said company spokesman Amit Zimmer. 'You see the lasers go up so quickly like a flash and the target is finished.' Countries are vying to weaponise laser technology. The U.S. Navy announced last year that it will attach a prototype of its Laser Weapons System (LaWS) to USS Ponce and send the amphibious transport docking ship to the Middle East in 2014. This will be the first time a laser weapon is used in active service. The blast of infrared energy it delivers can disable a small boat or even take down a drone from above as an impressive Navy video shows. Navy researchers told reporters that the laser gun, or a 'directed energy pulse weapon' as the military call it, destroyed its targets 100 per cent of the time in testing. 'It operates much like a blowtorch... with an unlimited magazine,' a Navy official said. The solid-state laser prototype doesn't use up expensive ammunition so is cheap to operate. 'Its weapon round costs about $1 to shoot,' said Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder, a Navy researcher. However, LaWS costs more to build in the first place - at around $32 million per unit.","SkyShield was approved for commercial use by Israel's Ministry of Defence .

Attempting to land on a rotating comet racing through the solar system at 150,000 mph is no easy feat. But why bother trying, when you can just fire off a harpoon to collect samples at a safe distance with surgical precision? That’s exactly what Nasa is attempting to do with its prototype designs of a space harpoon which it hopes will return rock samples that could reveal the origins of planets. Scroll down for video . Nasa is developing prototype designs of a space harpoon. Pictured is an artist's concept of a tethered 'penetrator' heading toward a celestial body to take a sample . ‘This technology will be able for the first time to pull samples of the order of a few kilograms from depths of a few metres, which could greatly enhance our knowledge of solar system objects,’ Robert Winglee of the University of Washington wrote in a Nasa report. ‘Moreover, it offers the opportunity to take multiple samples at little extra cost so that it will provide much greater flexibility and greatly enhance the science return for any given mission,’ he added. The conventional way to do a robotic sample-return mission is to perform a soft landing on a celestial object, collect small amounts of material and then return it to Earth. The technology will be able, for the first time, to pull samples of the order of a few kilograms from depths of a few metres from celestial objects such as comets . While Nasa is looking at the use of harpoons to collect samples for celestial bodies, British engineers believe similar technology could be used to clear up space junk. Stevenage-based Astrium has plans to develop 'chase' satellite fitted with five or more harpoons which can fire at a moving target. Using laser and radar guidance systems, a piece of space junk would be targeted, and then captured with a gas-propelled harpoon on a tether. Once the space junk is secured, a smaller sub-satellite detaches from the chase satellite and pulls the junk downwards to burn up as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. Then the chase satellite would search out another target. Experts hope the system could remove around five pieces of space debris a year. This is what the Rosetta probe is planning to do in August when it reaches the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko– one of the most risky parts of its mission. ‘We're not talking about doing that,’ Professor Winglee said earlier this month, according to a report in Space.com. ‘We're talking about using the kinetic energy of the spacecraft as it's moving past the object, and we're not asking the system to brake, so you save energy.’ The team's design currently uses a sample-return spacecraft to carry six, rocket-shaped penetrators, which would be fired down at the celestial body during a flyby. The penetrators, attached to a tether, would hit at a high speed of up to 2,240 mph (3,605 km/h, or 1 km/sec) and go deep beneath the surface. Several pounds of material would then be collected in a tube, which would be reeled back in to send back to Earth. Researchers have been testing the equipment by firing test harpoons into a 55-gallon drum full of cometary simulant - sand, salt, pebbles or a mixture of each. The bow string is pulled back by an electric winch to generate a precise level of force, up to 1,000 pounds, firing the harpoon at 70mph. The team's design currently uses a sample-return spacecraft to carry six, rocket-shaped penetrators, which would be fired down at the celestial body during a flyby. A demonstration of the sample collection chamber is pictured . Lead engineer Donald Wegel said: ‘We had to bolt it to the floor, because the recoil made the whole testbed jump after every shot. 'We're not sure what we'll encounter on the comet – the surface could be soft and fluffy, mostly made up of dust, or it could be ice mixed with pebbles, or even solid rock. 'Most likely, there will be areas with different compositions, so we need to design a harpoon that's capable of penetrating a reasonable range of materials.’ Comets are frozen chunks of ice and dust left over from our solar system's formation. As such, scientists want a closer look at them for clues to the origin of planets and ultimately, how life formed on Earth. The technology could be used to collect samples from comets that could reveal how life forms on other planets.

Federal Judge William Pauley III said . the allegations against Van Hise represented ‘really shocking, . depraved and violent conduct.’ Michael Van Hise (left) and . 'Cannibal Cop' Gilberto Valle (right) meet via a fetish website. Van Hise is charged with offering Valle $5,000 to kidnap a woman for him to rape and murder . ‘The conduct is so far beyond the pale, and presents such a great danger to the community, that there is no set of conditions the court can conceive of that could be set for bail for the defendant,' he said. Defense lawyer Alice Fontier had attempted to explain away Van Hise's online conversations as pure fantasy and not something he ever intended to act upon, reports the New York Post. Fontier told the judge on that Van Hise didn't mean anything he wrote on the darkfetishnet.com website that he frequently visited. She also noted that after signing up to the website, which has more than 37,000 members, she had received a barrage of emails from people ‘offering to hang me, torture me, rape me, eat me.’ It was unclear if the child allegedly discussed during the chat was one of Van Hise's own. He and his wife, Bolice, have a 2-year-old son and a daughter born last month. Van Hise is charged with offering . NYPD cop Gilberto Valle $5,000 to kidnap a woman so he could rape and . murder her after they met on the site. A federal judge has denied Van Hise (pictured with wife Bolise) bail after hearing allegations that he discussed raping an infant during an online chat . Valle, 28, was denied bail by a federal appeals court on Tuesday. Charged with conspiring to rape, kill and eat women, he is now set for trial next month. Further gruesome details about Van Hise's plans were revealed at a magistrates hearing earlier this month. U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman heard how Van Hise had sent a photo of his wife’s seven-year-old niece to two people in an internet chat room, offering her and her nine-year-old sister for rape. Prosecutor Assistant U.S. Attorney Randall Jackson alleged that Van Hise had similar plans for his own stepdaughter, whose identity has not been revealed for legal reasons. Referring to the online message, posted on Yahoo.com, Jackson said: 'The three-year-old (stepdaughter) he wants to keep as his sex slave.' 'Cannibal cop' Gilberto Valle was denied bail by a federal appeals court on Tuesday and is now set for trial next month . He allegedly also posted the street in Hamilton, New Jersey, on which the girls live, adding: 'We can engage in other activities [with them]', the court was told. Jackson said Van Hise told an FBI agent that he and Valle were 'serious' about their plans to kidnap and rape a woman before admitting he was sexually aroused around children. Van Hise's estranged wife, Bolise, 22, defended him as a 'big teddy bear', adding: 'They make him out to be a monster. He’s not. He’s as hard-core as a baby.' The alleged plot was unearthed after Valle's estranged wife Kathleen Mangan, 28, tipped off police when she found sick internet messages detailing plans to abduct, rape, cook and eat 100 female victims. The alleged plot was unearthed after Valle's estranged wife Kathleen Mangan (pictured together) tipped off police when she found sick internet messages detailing plans to abduct, rape, cook and eat 100 female victims . Files found on the father of one’s computer included one titled: ‘Abducting and Cooking Victim I: A Blueprint’. It listed materials required including chloroform and rope as well as chronicling the practicalities of fitting a victim into an oven – her legs, he noted, would have to be bent. Valle also expressed a desire to cook one particular victim slowly – ‘tying her onto some form of apparatus’ and trying to ‘keep her alive as long as possible’. In a particularly chilling section of the internet transcripts read out in Manhattan Federal Court during his bail hearing, Valle shared his hunger for ‘girl meat’ on Thanksgiving in an email exchange with an alleged co-conspirator. His defense maintain these were nothing but fantasies and have pointed out that no women were hurt, although among his named ‘victims’ are women whom the FBI have established did indeed know Valle. Two of them claim to have been ‘stalked in an intimidating way’ by the police officer, who served in Harlem for six years. Valle plead not guilty to all charges, including illegally accessing the National Criminal Database to search out potential victims. He has been held without bail and if convicted faces life imprisonment.","Michael Van Hise has been denied bail in federal court .

Hair of the dog has been long touted as a cure for blistering hangovers, but for one very lucky puppy the headache was well worth it after a two-day vodka binge saved his life. Maltese terrier Charlie was just hours from certain death after licking coolant, a very sweet product often used in radiator and brake fluids, off a garage floor near Melbourne, Australia. But thanks to a quick-thinking vet at Animal Accident and Emergency hospital, it was recognised that the puppy had ethylene glycol poisoning. If untreated, the poisoning can cause kidney failure and death within a day. Scroll down for video . Life saving: After it was confirmed Charlie the Maltese terrier had ethylene glycol poisoning, vodka was used to to counteract the effects and save his life . The solution was to get the dog drunk over 48 hours using a bottle of vodka for successive doses to counteract the poising. As part of the life saving procedure, 700ml of vodka was fed intravenously into Charlie through a tube in his nose through to his stomach. The alcohol is able to change the chemical reaction, stop kidney failure and ultimately death. The Herald Sun reported Charlie's owner Jacinta Roseware said she was surprised by the effects the procedure had on her pet. 'He was definitely drunk,' she said. 'He was stumbling around, Iâ€™d go to pat him and heâ€™d push me away like a normal drunk person, he was vomiting a little, whining like a drunk.' Lucky! After the two-day procedure Charlie made a full recovery to return to full health . Love: Charlie pictured with his owner Jacinta Roseware after the ordeal, which nearly cost the puppy his life . 'I thought it was hilarious ... It was distressing but funny at the same time.' But just as it does in humans, Ms Roseware suspects the puppy struggled with an almighty hangover the following day. 'He just slept and slept and slept,' she said. 'I tried to take him for a walk ... but he just sat down after 50 metres ... I had to pick him up and carry him home.' Hangover: Ms Roseware said Charlie was not his usual self while dealing with the effects of a massive hangover . In an Animal Accident and Emergency blog, a post confirmed Charlie was feeling the effects of being drunk during treatment in the hospital's intensive care unit. 'In fact for the whole weekend, Charlie had a huge party with us in the Pet ICU,' the post said. 'The vodka sedated Charlie and while undergoing therapy, we needed to monitor Charlie.' The hospital treats two to three cases of ethylene glycol a year, with vodka the easiest form of treatment. Happy ending: The animal hospital where Charlie was treated said they treat up to three ethylene glycol poisoning a year .","Maltese terrier puppy Charlie was poisoned after licking toxic engine coolant from a garage floor .

Pablo Zabaleta was left raging after some 'shocking decisions' from referee Stephane Lannoy in their Champions League clash with Barcelona. Manchester City were knocked out in the last 16 thanks to goals from Lionel Messi and Dani Alves, but Zabaleta, who was sent off, says three key decisions did not go his side's way. Zabaleta felt that there was a foul in . the build up to Barcelona's first goal, that City deserved a penalty and . he insists he should not have been dismissed. Off you go: Pablo Zabaleta was sent off for a second booking for disputing a penalty appeal with the referee . 'It was very clear - Pique came from behind and made the tackle on Edin Dzeko, and the referee was only two metres away. He saw that very clearly,' said Zabaleta. 'It was also a foul against Dzeko just before Barcelona’s first goal. He held the ball and turned, and Pique had hold of his shirt, and the ref gave a free-kick to Barcelona. 'Sometimes in the game you are nervous . because you are trying to get the result, and sometimes shocking . decisions by the ref make you a bit angry. 'I . don’t know why I got a red card because I went to him to talk in a good . way. I was a little bit angry to him because he didn’t give the penalty . but I was always respectful to him. 'I am very frustrated at the decision . because it was a shocking decision. I am disappointed but also very . proud of the team because I think we played a fantastic game.' Frustration: Zabaleta reacts after Lionel Messi's opening goal at the Nou Camp . In the middle: Lannoy (right) made a number of poor decisions on both sides on Wednesday night . Appeal: Lescott looked to have brought Messi down inside the area after eight minutes . Lannoy also missed what should have been a penalty for Barcelona, when Joleon Lescott fouled Messi in the first half. The officials also wrongly judged Jordi Alba to be offside and subsequently ruled out Neymar's goal from his cut-back. In . the first leg there was controversy when Jonas Eriksson awarded . Barcelona a penalty even though Martin Demichelis seemed to foul Messi . just outside the box. Ruben . Cousillas was on the touchline for City on Wednesday night, after .

Blackwell has been sentenced to death for the murder of 8-year-old Heather Brooke Center . Ricky Lee Blackwell, Sr. talks with his attorneys during the sentencing phase on Sunday, March, 16, 2014 . The jury, consisting of five women and seven men, deliberated for more than five hours. Blackwell's execution is set for June 14 but is expected to be delayed as the case is appealed. Solicitor Barry Barnette told jurors that Center's parents would miss multiple memories with their daughter. 'They’ll never see her go on her first date,' he reportedly said during closing arguments. 'They won’t see her go to her first prom. They won’t see her graduate from high school. How much would they pay to have one phone call, to send a piece of mail to her?' Heather Brooke Center, pictured, was killed by Blackwell in 2009 . Center, pictured, was only 8 years old at the time of her death . Barnette also argued that Blackwell is not mentally retarded -- something the defense had claimed. Barnette, the paper reports, said the forensic psychologist who testified was not 'credible.' Two other psychologists did not find Blackwell to be intellectually disabled. Barnette, the paper adds, also said that Blackwell's suicide attempts -- including when he shot himself in the stomach after officers arrived responding to the 2009 shooting -- were grabs for attention.

Apple's iPhone may be preventing you from typing certain words in your messages without you realising. Analysis from news website Daily Beast has discovered that iPhone handsets running Apple's latest software - iOS 6 - will not suggest corrections for words considered to be sensitive or provocative. Researchers used the built-in spell checker in the iOS API developer platform to test more than 250,000 words and discovered that suggestions do not apply for words including 'abortion', 'bullet', 'suicide' and 'pornography' when they have been mistyped. Analysis from news website Daily Beast has discovered that iPhones running Apple's latest software - iOS 6 - will not suggest corrections for words considered to be sensitive or provocative, such as suicide, pictured . Daily Beast took the 250,000 words from the built-in Mac OS X dictionary and the Wordnet corpus online dictionary. The researchers then wrote a script that generated three misspellings for each of these words. The misspelled words were run through Apple's iOS 6 spell checker. The results were analysed and any misspelled words that were offered suggestions were removed. The remaining 20,000 words were run through the spell checker again. Another script was written that automatically double-tapped a suggestion if it appeared. This left 14,000 words that are not offered suggestions using the iOS 6 spell checker. When a word is misspelled on an iOS . device including iPhones and iPads the incorrect word is highlighted in red. This word can be double-tapped to open a menu that lets users pick from suggestions the phone believes the user was trying to type. This fix works for the vast majority of words, but a few have been found to not have any suggestions, even if the mistake was by only one character. The software used in the Daily Beast test is different from . autocorrect, which attempts to guess a word and corrects it automatically. According to the Daily Beast analysis, iPhones on iOS 6 will not suggest corrections for even 'slight misspellings of words such as 'abortion,' 'rape,' 'ammo,' and 'bullet.' If a user types 'abortiom' with an 'm' instead of an 'n,' the software will highlight the word in red but when it is tapped a message saying 'No replacements found' appears. The analysis states that there are over 150,000 words that are corrected automatically on the iPhone. It adds that many 'modern spell-check and predictive text engines understand that the 'n' is located next to 'm' on a standard keyboard, so replacing it with its neighbor is the low-hanging fruit of the correction world.' When a word is misspelled on an iOS 6 device the word is highlighted in red and suggestions for alternative spellings are given. This fix works for the vast majority of words, but a few, such as 'abortion', pictured, have been found to not have any suggestions, even if the mistake was by only one character . This finding didn't just apply to provocative words, either. Daily Beast also found that 14,000 words which are recognised as words when spelled accurately, aren't given suggestions. This included technical words such as: 'nephrotoxin,' 'sempstress,' 'sheepshank,' or 'Aesopian,' to name a few. Among this list were also more frequently used words such as 'drunken,' 'drunkard,' 'Aryan,' 'murder,' and 'virginity.' In total, the analysis found words were not identified as jargon or technical words but were not given corrections, including 'bigot,' 'cuckold,' 'deflower,' 'homoerotic,' and 'marijuana.' The iPhones used for testing were all restored to factory settings and had no usage history. All new iOS phones and tablets, as well as those that have been updated, run on iOS 6 with spell check built-in.

Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation told Daily Beast: 'I  hate to say it, but I don’t think this should surprise anyone. 'Apple is one of the most censorious companies out there.' She cited the company’s history of censoring products in its App Store as an example of this.

Frail: Warren Jeffs, pictured here in 2011, was recently described as looking frail and he was hospitalized over the weekend . Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs has been hospitalized as he serves life in prison. Jeffs, 58, is now listed as being treated in a hospital by the Texas Department of Justice's website but no further details about his condition have been reported. He has been transferred to a hospital in Galveston, Texas, and the update in the online registry was made Sunday. This is the second time that he has been hospitalized since his 2011 sentencing. The first time he was a result of lengthy hunger strikes that left him in a medically induced coma. The last-known interview with Jeffs came last month during a deposition in a child custody case and he was described as looking ill during that interaction. The Salt Lake Tribune reported that a lawyer at the deposition described Jeffs as 'frail and pathetic' as he sat in a cage during the session. Jeffs is in jail after being convicted on two counts of the sexual assault of two girls- ages 12 and 15- who he claimed were his spiritual wives. After the jury deliberated for 30 minutes in the case, he was sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years which will be served consecutively. He will be eligible for parole in 2038. The deposition comes in connection to a child custody case filed by a former member of The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the group that Jeffs founded. Taken for examination: What caused the hospitalization in Galveston, Texas has not been announced but his status was updated on the online Texas prison registry over the weekend . Changing looks: Jeffs, seen here in a 2007 court appearance, is the founder of the undamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints . Lorin Holm has filed the suit because when he left the sect in 2011- which he described as a voluntary move but is also believed to have been encouraged and forced by Jeffs- Mr Holm's minor children were left in the care of Jeffs. Mr Holm fears that his children are at risk of being sexually assaulted by the group's leaders and he is now fighting to be given custody. In spite of his frail condition, Jeffs was accused of still being the de-facto leader of his controversial sect. The Department of Justice filed a civil-rights motion in November against Colorado City and Hildale, Utah, which claims that the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, of which Jeffs is the president, runs both town's and not the elected leaders. As part of the lawsuit, fawning letters sent by Colorado City Mayor George M. Allred to Jeffs, 57, were filed that claim to reveal how the shamed polygamous religious leader was asked for advice on who to appoint as new police chief for the town and is even assumed to have a supernatural ability to speak to God.","Jeffs, 58, was hospitalized in 2011 after hunger strikes left him frail and in a medically-induced coma .

Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the Tsarnaev brothers lived prior to their terror attack at the Boston Marathon, has announced they will not allow dead suspect Tamerlan's body to be buried there, it was revealed Sunday. City manager Robert Healy said Tsarnaev's body was not welcomed in one of its cemeteries. 'I have determined that it is not in the best interest of peace within the city to execute a cemetery deed for a plot within the Cambridge Cemetery for the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev,' Healey said. The news comes as Tsarnaev's uncle,  Ruslan Tsarni, arrived in the Bay State to claim his nephew's body and prepare for a funeral. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Worcester, Massachusetts funeral home . owner Peter Stefan said dozens of protesters have gathered outside his . business, upset with his decision to handle the service. ‘My . problem here is trying to find a gravesite. A lot of people don't want . to do it. They don't want to be involved with this,’ Stefan said. ‘I . keep bringing up the point of Lee Harvey Oswald, Timothy McVeigh or Ted . Bundy. Somebody had to do those, too.’ Every cemetery in Massachusetts has turned down the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Stefan told Fox News, but he remains insistent that this death be handled like any other. It is also understood that Stefan has reached out unsuccessfully to cemeteries in New Jersey and Connecticut. Stefan firmly intended to provide Tsarnaev with tradition Muslim funeral rites, which some protestors take issue with. It was unclear who, if any, among the deceased's family would step in to ensure the rites—such as the ritual bathing and shrouding of the body—were undertaken according to the religion's traditions. Tsarni chose to step in, he said, because 'no one wants to associate their names with such evil events' and because religion and tradition call for his nephew to be buried. Dealing:Tsarni and Stefan walk toward reporters. Tsarni arrived Sunday saying 'I'm dealing with logistics. A dead person must be buried.' 'I'm dealing with logistics,' he said. 'A dead person must be buried.' Tsarni and three of his friends met with the Stefan Sunday afternoon. Some picketers believe the bombing suspect should be buried at sea, similar to what was done with the body of Osama bin Laden. Other protestors simply did not want Tsarnaev's remains in their town, like retired firefighter Ronald Wahlers. 'It’s going to give this neighborhood a bad name,' Wahlers, who has lived in Worcester for a year and a half, told the Boston Globe. 'This guy doesn’t belong here.' Stefan disagrees. ‘I can’t control the circumstances of somebody’s death, or what they’ve done, or how they’ve died,’ he said. ‘In this country, we bury the dead.’ He's back: Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan's uncompromising manner won him brief internet fame.

The certificate lists the time of his death as 1:35 a.m. on April 19, four days after the deadly bombing, Stefan said. Tsarnaev died after a gunfight with authorities who had launched a massive manhunt for him and his brother, ethnic Chechens from Russia who came to the United States about a decade ago. Police have said he ran out of ammunition before his younger brother dragged his body under a vehicle while fleeing. Tsarnaev's family was making arrangements Friday for his funeral as investigators searched the woods near a college attended by 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was captured less than a day after his brother's death. Body: Tsarvaev's body is now at Graham Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester, waiting to be buried . The body was released by the state medical examiner Thursday. It initially was taken to a North Attleborough funeral home, where it was greeted by about 20 protesters, before being taken to Stefan's Graham Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlors, which is familiar with Muslim services. Meanwhile, two U.S. officials said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told interrogators that he and his brother initially considered setting off their bombs on July Fourth. Boston police said they planned to review security procedures for the Independence Day Boston Pops concert and fireworks display, which draws a crowd of more than 500,000 annually and is broadcast to a national TV audience. Authorities plan to look at security procedures for large events held in other cities, notably the massive New Year's Eve celebration held each year in New York City's Times Square, Massachusetts state police spokesman David Procopio said. Gov. Deval Patrick said everything possible will be done to assure a safe event. As part of the bombing investigation, federal, state and local authorities were searching the woods near the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth campus, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student. Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, could not say what investigators were looking for but said residents should know there is no threat to public safety. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found . hiding in a tarp-covered boat in a backyard in Watertown, a Boston . suburb, faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. Three of his college classmates were arrested Wednesday and accused of . helping after the bombing to remove a laptop and backpack from his . dormitory room before the FBI searched it. The . April 15 bombing, which used pressure cookers packed with explosives, . nails, ball bearings and metal shards, killed three people and injured . more than 260 others near the marathon's finish line. Angry: Dozens of protestors have begun picketing Stefan's business, like Scott Schaeffer-Duffy, pictured, who crossed the Boston marathon finish line minutes before the bombs detonated . The brothers decided to carry out the attack before Independence Day when they finished assembling the bombs, the surviving suspect told interrogators after he was arrested, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation. Investigators believe some of the explosives used in the attack were assembled in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's home, though there may have been some assembly elsewhere, one of the officials said. It does not appear that the brothers ever had big, definitive plans, the official said. The brothers' mother insists the allegations against them are lies. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security ordered border agents to immediately begin verifying that every international student who arrives in the U.S. has a valid student visa, according to an internal memorandum obtained Friday by The Associated Press. The new procedure is the government's first security change directly related to the Boston bombings. The order from a senior official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, David J. Murphy, was circulated Thursday and came one day after President Barack Obama's administration acknowledged that one of the students accused of hiding evidence, Azamat Tazhayakov, of Kazakhstan, was allowed to return to the U.S. in January without a valid student visa. Tazhayakov's lawyer has said he had nothing to do with the bombing and was shocked by it.

Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay has been arrested on suspicion of intoxicated driving, authorities said Monday. Irsay, 54, was arrested Sunday night in the northern Indianapolis suburb of Carmel on preliminary charges of driving while intoxicated and possession of a controlled substance, Hamilton County Sheriff's Department Deputy Bryant Orem said. The billionaire has been in and out of rehab over the years and has said he kicked his addiction to prescription painkillers - but sources close to the businessman say otherwise. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . James Irsay, owner of the NFL's Indianapolis Colts, was jailed early March 17 . Friends say Irsay has been battling his drug problem for some time, and that his arrest could be a blessing in disguise. 'He's a sick, sick man,' one source told the Indy Star. 'He desperately needs help.' According to the Indy Star Irsay's recent dramatic weight loss - he went from 235lb to 165lb - has raised red flags among his friends and acquaintances. Irsay drove at a slow rate of speed, stopped in the roadway and failed to signal a turn before police stopped him, Lieutenant Joe Bickel of the Carmel Police Department said in a release. Teetotal: Irsay told Twitter followers that he hasn't had an alcoholic drink in 15 years last October . Jailed: Attorney James Voyles (left) and Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay leave the Hamilton County Jail in Indianapolis, Monday after Irsay was detained overnight . 'During the course of the investigation, Irsay subsequently failed several roadside field sobriety tests,' Bickel said. Myra Borshoff Cook, a spokeswoman for Irsay, declined to comment early Monday on his arrest. In an inventory of Irsay's vehicle, 'multiple prescription drugs were discovered in pill bottles,' police said. 'These Schedule IV prescription drugs were not associated with any prescription bottles found in the vehicle.' Irsay, who frequently interacts with fans of the NFL team on Twitter, wrote an October 2013 tweet saying 'I don't drink...haven't in over 15 years.' Irsay acknowledged in 2002 that he had become dependent on painkillers after several years of orthopedic operations but said he had overcome the problem after undergoing treatment. Marion County prosecutors said the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigated how Irsay obtained the painkillers. Federal authorities wouldn't confirm any investigation was taking place. Prosecutors at the time said they saw no reason to charge Irsay. A plastic surgeon who wrote painkiller prescriptions for Irsay later surrendered his federal permit to prescribe narcotic drugs. League spokesman Greg Aiello said in an e-mail to USA Today Sports that Irsay, if found guilty, would be subject to league discipline, the same as a player would. Weight loss: A fuller-looking Jim Irsay addresses media about his team the Colts in 2012 . Drug charges: Irsay (pictured in October 2013) now faces four felony charges relating to drug and intoxicated driving . 'The league's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all NFL personnel,' Aiello said. Irsay, who lives in Carmel, became the Colts owner in 1997 after the death of his father, Robert Irsay and a lengthy legal battle with his father's second wife. Along the way, Jim Irsay held virtually every job from ball boy to general manager. Forbes magazine estimated Irsay's net worth at $1.6 billion. Meg Irsay filed in November for divorce from her husband of 33 years, citing an 'irretrievable breakdown' of the marriage. A joint statement issued by the couple said Jim Irsay would retain full ownership of the Colts and his other business interests.  The couple, who married in 1980, have been separated for a decade and are the parents of three adult daughters. Since taking ownership of the team, Jim Irsay has made a reputation for himself by buying the scroll manuscript of Jack Kerouac's beat poem 'On the Road. 'for $2.43 million and often takes to Twitter to post comments ranging from the Colts' inner workings, popular music, and idle thoughts.","Jim Irsay, 54, owner of the Indianapolis Colts, was arrested Sunday night for DUI and possession of a controlled substance .

A gold medalist Canadian freestyle skier had only one person that he wanted to celebrate with after completing his near-perfect run in Sochi: his disabled brother. Alex Bilodeau has spoken countless times about how he is so close with his brother Frederic, who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at a young age and told he would not be able to walk beyond the age of 12, yet more than 15 years later he is still able to do so. When 26-year-old Alex made the final stop at the end of the mountain on Monday night, he immediately ran over to his brother and pulled him over the barrier so that they could celebrate together. New record: Alex Bilodeau (left) became the first moguls skier to win two Olympic golds in freestyle skiing . Inspiration: Alex Bilodeau (left) says that his brother Frederic (right) is his everyday inspiration because of the challenges that he has moving . Together: As soon as he finished the run, Alex ran over to his brother and lifted him from behind the security barrier so that they could celebrate together . Shot to fame: Alex's first gold came in 2010 and his brother Frederic has become something of a celebrity in the disabled community in Canada because of the awareness he has raised . 'Just like you or I, he has dreams and most of them are not realisable to him but he does dream about it, he talks about it and he never complains that it's not realistic to him,’ Alex said of his brother. 'Every day I feel very lucky to be a normal person that has the chance to go after his dreams, and he doesn't have that chance. So out of respect to him, I need to go after that and with his motivation he would be four-time Olympic champion. 'It's crazy the motivation that he takes and every step is very hard for him. In life, I have an easy path and I need to go out there and do the best I can just out of respect to him. 'He lives his dreams through me. (Two gold medals) is the least I can do, he's my every day inspiration.' Big deal: Monday night¿s gold means that Bilodeau has become the first moguls skier with multiple Olympic medals as well as three world championship golds in dual moguls . Going for it: Bilodeau is seen here during his last jump in the run on Monday night . Strong showing: Bilodeau won and his close competitor and fellow Canadian Mikael Kingsbury came in second while Russia's Alexandr Smyshlyaev came in third . Although Frederic briefly slipped over, his brother lifted him back onto his feet. The freestyle skiing was a clean sweep for Bilodeau’s homeland, with two of the three top spots going to Canadians with his frequent competitor Mikael Kingsbury who came in second. 'When I'm on the hill (Kingsbury) is in my mind and he's pushing me to be a better skier, but outside of the hill, whether I'm in university or training or whatever I do in life, my brother is my every day inspiration,' Bilodeau said. Monday night’s gold means that Bilodeau has become the first moguls skier with multiple Olympic medals as well as three world championship golds in dual moguls- though he was never able to become individual champion, settling twice for silver. He previously announced that he would retire at the end of the World Cup season and predicted Kingsbury would take over his mantle once he's gone. So happy: His girlfriend Sabrina Bizier also greeted him at the finish line .

A family turned a run-of-the mill Victorian painting into a valuable masterpiece from the Crimean war – after the detail of a woman’s shoe caught their eye. For although Christie’s in London once assessed the work as being by an unknown artist, closer examination of the shoe of a maid in the picture suggested the hand of an acclaimed painter who had depicted very similar footwear before. Buoyed by the shoe clue, Gary and Helen Sutcliffe and their son Jonathan then scoured galleries across the world, before poring over the wooden frame of the picture. The shoes in the work, now known to be by Barrett, right, are very similar to those in his other paintings, left . They were delighted to confirm their hunch was right by discovering their chief suspect’s signature tucked away out of sight. Now the painting – by Jerry Barrett, who famously depicted Florence Nightingale at work during the Crimean war – is on sale for £180,000. The ‘Shoedunnit’ case began when the Sutcliffe family, who own a gallery in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, two years ago snapped up the dirt-covered picture of an elegant English lady being dressed by two servants in Turkey, for £9,000. The oil painting had some years before been described by a Christie’s expert as merely ‘circle of John Callcot Horsley’, meaning it was believed to be by a student or imitator of the British painter best known as the designer of the first Christmas card. But the Sutcliffes had a hunch the apparently unsigned picture was the work of another Victorian painter, Jerry Barrett, whose most notable painting, Nightingale receiving the Wounded at Scutari, depicts Florence Nightingale in the field hospital at Scutari during the Crimean War. Gary Sutcliffe thought the shoe on the protruding and ‘slightly stumpy’ left foot of the maid on the right of the picture looked familiar. And painstaking research revealed that, as the Sutcliffes had vaguely recalled, Barrett had used a strikingly similar design, and shape of shoe in at least one other painting. They decided the clincher was the shoe in Barrett’s ‘Sheridan assisting Miss Linley on her flight from Bath’. Jonathan Sutcliffe said: ‘It was the . same type of shoe, with an unusual rosette decoration, as in another of . Barrett’s paintings.’ That . confirmation of the shoe clue was giant step in the right direction - . but it took another six months of detective work, mainly by Jonathan . Sutcliffe, to get the case nailed down. When the painting was taken to Christie's, it was attributed to an unknown artist and valued at £9,000 . The research involved the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the National Portrait Gallery and Victoria and Albert Museum in London,  and Barrett’s home town of Brighton to make absolutely sure. Ultimately, the Sutcliffes were delighted to discover the clincher had been there unnoticed all the time. Finally they found Barrett’s signature hidden out of sight under the frame at the back - and it matched a similarly hidden signature on a Barrett painting kept, but not displayed, in Hove Museum and Art Gallery. This was the final proof - the picture was Barrett’s long-lost work Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in Turkey, based on the artist’s visit to Scutari when he prepared sketches for his Florence Nightingale oil and also Queen Victoria’s First Visit to her Wounded Soldiers, now both in the National Portrait Gallery. Lady Mary is  remembered for her 18th century letters, particularly from Turkey, where she was wife to the British ambassador, and also as a pioneer of inoculation against smallpox, of which she had been a victim. The cleaned-up canvas will next week be on sale at the prestigious Chelsea Antiques and Fine Art Fair in London, which starts on Wednesday (March 19),  with an enhanced price tag of £180,000. The long-lost painting was exhibited at the National Gallery in 1858 and the elderly woman whose family had owned it for decades took it to Christie’s for appraisal in 1990 when it was attributed to ‘circle of Horsley’. But thanks to the low price suggested was not put up for sale in 2012, attributed as Christie’s had suggested earlier, and was duly bought by the Sutcliffes for £9,000. Jonathan Sutcliffe said: ‘It is every art dealer’s dream to come across something like this . ‘It didn’t look much in the saleroom but there were tell-tale signs it was the missing part of Barrett’s trilogy -  and we were proved right.’","Family found painting worth 20 times what they thought .

Andy Murray received mixed blessings in the draw for the Australian Open, and it is likely to require a monumental effort if he is to reach what would be a fourth final in Melbourne. On the encouraging side he gets a relatively benign introduction to the tournament, crucial as he tries to get match tight after the long layoff following back surgery. More problematically he will need to discover his best form for a second week that could see him having to beat Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in succession to win the first Grand Slam of the season.

Tough start: Laura Robson opens against Belgian No 18 seed Kirsten Flipkens . Then . comes potentially the mother of all hat-tricks, but nothing can be . guaranteed in the second week. That is especially the case as Nadal, on . his return to Melbourne Park after missing last year, has been placed in . a fiendishly difficult part of the draw. His . first round looks a real blockbuster, against Australian anti-hero .

The alleged victim of a racist attack by the father of Chelsea captain John Terry denies making up the abuse so he could sell it to the papers, the Old Bailey has heard. Ted Terry, 59, is accused of headbutting Amarjit Talafair and calling him a ‘f****** P***’ after a drunken row over a cigarette. Mr Talafair, who works in customer service for train operator C2C, went to police after recognising his attacker from a photograph on the internet, the court heard. Trial: Amarjit Talafair has accused the father of John Terry, Ted (right), of racist abuse and of headbutting him . He admitted he knew about the allegations John Terry racially abused another player during a football match but denied suggestions he only went to police because of Ted Terry’s celebrity status. Ted Terry’s barrister, Alexia Power, said: ‘You only chose to go to police when you found out that Mr Terry was a celebrity, the father of a footballer.’ Mr Talafair replied: ‘That doesn’t bother me at all. If someone was assaulting, racially abusing me I would have gone to police anyway.’ He admitted he asked police once about going to the newspapers with the story but was advised it would ruin the investigation. Miss Power said: ‘That’s what this is all about, isn’t it?’ Accused: The court heard that Mr Talafair made up the abuse to try and sell his story to the papers . Mr Talafair replied: ‘No it’s not. He racially abused me and I don’t want him to get away with it.’ Miss Power continued: ‘You embellished what happened with racist abuse purely because of who Mr Terry is. You want to sell your story.’ Terry is standing trial for the racist attack at the Old Bailey alongside his friends Tudor Musteata, a 47-year-old Moldovan, and Stephen Niland, 36. Mr Talafair claimed the attack started when he refused to give Ted Terry a cigarette outside the Windsor Pub near Fenchurch Street station in central London on 22 March last year. Also accused: Stephen Niland (left) and Tudor Musteata (below) are also standing trial . He told jurors: 'They put on a fake . Eastern European accent and said ""Can I have a cigarette."" I said no I . don’t have any cigarettes. They got aggressive, started swearing at us . and they started racially abusing me. Incident: The incident took place at The Windsor Pub near Fenchurch Street station, London, last March . 'They started saying “f****** p*****”, then “f****** c****”, then after that they got racial and were calling me “f****** P***”.' Mr Talafair said he walked off with a friend towards New London House but were followed by the three men. 'As the third male [Ted Terry] walked past me he said something to me, took two or three steps twoards me and tried to headbutt me. He put his head towards me but I moved my head back.' Miss Power suggested that Terry ‘put his forehead to your mouth, stopping you shouting’. Mr Talafair replied: ‘No, if I wasn’t able to move back he probably would have broken my nose or something.’ Terry denies using racist language during the confrontation. Jurors have heard Terry also racially abused a black cleaner at Fenchurch Street station, calling him a ‘black c***’. Terry denies racially aggravated common assault and racially aggravated fear or provocation of violence. Niland and Musteata deny racially aggravated fear or provocation of violence. The trial continues.

A mother has spoken of her anger as police continue to hold on to her teenage daughter's remains - more than one year after her body was found. Hailey Darlene Dunn, 13, went missing from her home in Colorado City, West Texas, in December 2010. Her remains were discovered in March 2013 - more than two years later - near a lake about 20 miles away. Anger: Billie Jean Dunn (centre), pictured with her boyfriend (right) and daughter Hailey (left), has spoken of her anger as police continue to hold on to her daughter's remains - more than one year after her body was found . Victim: Hailey Darlene Dunn, 13, disappeared from her home in Colorado City, West Texas, in December 2010 . No arrests have yet been made, while the cheerleader's remains are still being held by police. Now, Hailey's mother, Billie Jean Dunn, has said she is going through 'pure hell' as she waits for officers to release what is left of her daughter's body. '[It's] hell, just pure hell,' the 37-year-old told The Huffington Post. 'At first I didn’t want to push for her remains back because I . wanted them to get every bit of evidence they needed, but it has been a . year and we want her home.' Home: Ms Dunn reported the cheerleader missing from her house (pictured) on the morning of December 28 . Discovery: Hailey's remains were discovered in March 2013 - more than two years later - near Lake Thomas (pictured) in Scurry County. No arrests have yet been made and the remains are still being held by police . Ms Dunn reported her daughter missing from her home, about 250 miles west of Dallas, on the morning of December 28, 2010. The Colorado City Middle School student's remains were found on March 16, 2013 - more than two years later - near Lake Thomas in Scurry County. They were positively identified through DNA as belonging to the teenager - and since then, have reportedly been held in an evidence locker at the University of North Texas. One month after Hailey's disappearance, Ms Dunn's then-boyfriend, Shawn Adkins was named a person of interest by police. Arrest: Ms Dun, pictured at Mitchell County Sheriff's Office, was arrested by police in March 2011 after falsely telling officers that her then-boyfriend, Shawn Adkins, had been at her home on the night of December 27. She later pleaded no contest to a charge of making a false report and was sentenced to one year's probation . Tributes: Dozens of cuddly toys hang on a bridge in Hailey's hometown of Colorado City on March 18, 2011 . He allegedly told officers the teenager had spent . the night of December 27 with a friend - only for that friend to later . uncover his remarks as false. He also reportedly failed a polygraph test and gave inconsistencies to police in statements about his job and whereabouts on the night in question. However, Adkins, who split from Ms Dunn in 2012, has continued to deny any involvement in Hailey's disappearance or murder and has never been charged. Ms Dunn herself was arrested by police in March 2011 and charged with falsely telling officers that her boyfriend had . been at her home on December 27. In memory: Ms Dunn (right) is pictured at a public memorial service at Colorado Middle School in May last year . Grieving: The investigation into her 13-year-old daughter's death is believed to be active and ongoing . She later pleaded no contest to a charge of making a false report to authorities and was sentenced to one year's probation, according to local media reports. Meanwhile, other charges against her, including those of misdemeanor, hindering prosecution and possessing a dangerous drug, were dropped as part of a plea agreement. Today, Ms Dunn said the past 12 months had been 'very hard' to deal with - particularly because of the lack of suspects or arrests. 'It is hard waking up in the morning when the first thing you think is, ""we . don't have our daughter anymore"", and then going to sleep at night and . having it be the last thing on your mind,' she said. Sad: Tracy Hopper comforts her daughter, Maci, 13, as they remember Hailey Dunn during the memorial service . She . added that she 'won't have full closure' until arrests are made - and . plans to cremate Hailey's remains once they are turned over to the . family. 'I am very disappointed. It has been a whole year and nothing has changed,' she said. Ms Dunn said she had launched a petition urging Scurry County Sheriff, Trey Wilson, to call for a review of both the case and the release of Hailey's remains.

The FA were are considering appealing against an independent disciplinary commission for the second time in a week after Newcastle manager Alan Pardew escaped with a seven-match ban for butting Hull’s David Meyler. The punishment, made up of a three-match stadium ban and a four-game touchline suspension, is a record for a Premier League manager but it is sufficiently lenient to spare Pardew further censure from Newcastle amid fears that he was in danger of being sacked by owner Mike Ashley. But any sense of relief could soon disappear if the FA choose to appeal when they receive the written reasons for a judgement that has left Wembley officials slightly baffled; not least the decision to split the suspension between a stadium ban and a touchline one. VIDEO Scroll down to see Alan Pardew and Steve Bruce's comments after the headbutt . Appeal: The FA are considering appealing against Alan Pardew's seven-match ban for headbutting Hull's David Meyler . Clashing point: David Meyler had to restrained by fellow player Hull City player Ahmed Elmohamady . Anger: Meyler was seen pushing Pardew as the pair clashed when a stray ball went out of play . Fulham (A) - Sat 15 Mar (stadium ban) Crystal Palace (H) - Sat 22 Mar (stadium ban) Everton (H) - Tue 25 Mar (stadium ban) Southampton (A) - Sat 29 Mar (touchline ban) Man United (H) - Sat 5 Apr (touchline ban) Stoke (A) - Sat 12 Apr (touchline ban) Swansea (H) - Sat 19 Apr (touchline ban) Arsenal (A) - Mon 28 Apr . Cardiff (H) - Sat 3 May . Liverpool (A) - Sun 11 May . Those written reasons are expected on Friday from a so-far-unnamed panel, and while the case underlines the independence of these disciplinary commissions the FA have yet again been left frustrated by their own disciplinary process. Only last week it emerged that the FA wanted to see West Brom’s Nicolas Anelka suspended for double the five-match ban he received for his ‘quenelle’ goal celebration in a game against West Ham in December. The FA are considering an appeal against that judgement as well, with an announcement anticipated Thursday. Clearly, the FA thought Pardew deserved a harsher punishment for his attack on Meyler during a game his team were winning comfortably. In the wake of Paul Ince’s five-match stadium ban for a physical confrontation with a fourth official in the tunnel earlier this season, a stadium ban as long as 10 matches was thought to be possible. Revisited: The FA were left frustrated last week when Nicolas Anelka only received a five-match ban for his 'quenelle' gesture . Clash: Paul Ince was handed a five-match ban when he clashed with the fourth offical while manager of Blackpool . Clash: Pardew reacted in unprecedented fashion to being barged by the Ireland international . Scuffle: The incident started after Meyler pushed Pardew out of the way with the ball rolling towards him . Off you go: Pardew is sent to the stands by referee Kevin Friend . Newcastle United are disappointed with the actions of its manager Alan Pardew this afternoon (Saturday, 1st March). His behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of Newcastle United. It is most disappointing that this incident has taken the focus away from what was a fantastic performance by the team and an excellent result away from home which leaves the club in eighth place in the Barclays Premier League. Sadly, the headlines tomorrow will not be focused on the result or the efforts of the players, but instead on the actions of our manager. Alan unreservedly apologised immediately following the game to the player, to Hull City Football Club and its fans, and to the fans of Newcastle United. We have held discussions this evening with Alan who has offered his sincere apologies to the Club and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions. Alan has accepted a formal warning from the Club in relation to his behaviour today and also a Club fine of £100,000. The Club is now drawing a line under this matter and will be making no further comment. As things stand Pardew will not return to the Newcastle dug-out until the final three games of the season, at the end of April. Pardew attended the two-hour hearing at Wembley and an admission of guilt, as well as the mitigation he offered, was clearly well-received by the commission. Nevertheless he will not be present for Newcastle’s visit to Fulham on Saturday. He will also miss home clashes with Crystal Palace and Everton, handing control to assistant John Carver before returning to the stands for the visit to Southampton. Then he misses home games against Manchester United and Swansea City and the trip to Stoke City. He will return for the Arsenal game at the Emirates on April 29. Pardew has also been fined £60,000, on top of the £100,000 fine he received from Newcastle immediately after the incident. Pardew said: ‘As I have made clear, I deeply regret the incident and again wholeheartedly apologise to all parties for my conduct, which I understand was not acceptable. ‘I will accept the punishment handed down by the FA today. My focus now turns to preparing the team for this weekend’s game against Fulham and finishing the season as strongly as possible.’ After the FA announced its decision, Newcastle issued a statement confirming their manager’s punishment. From above: Pardew (centre) looks on from the stands as Newcastle secured a 4-1 win . Opinionated: Alan Shearer, who managed Newcastle in 2009, slammed Pardew for his headbutt . It read: ‘Newcastle United can confirm that manager Alan Pardew will serve a seven-match suspension with immediate effect after admitting an FA misconduct charge following an incident with a Hull City player in the 72nd minute of the Barclays Premier League fixture on Saturday, 1st March. ‘An Independent Regulatory Commission today (Tuesday, 11th March) ruled the first three-matches imposed are a stadium ban with the remaining four a touchline ban. ‘Pardew was also fined £60,000 and warned as to his future conduct. The Club and Pardew have accepted the decision and now wish to draw a line under the matter.’ Bittersweet: Souness also laid into Pardew for his actions as Newcastle ran out 4-1 winners . Hot water: Pardew called Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini a 'f****** old c***' in January . Spitting feathers: Pardew was banned for two matches after pushing a linesman against Tottenham in 2012 . Room with a view: The Newcastle boss was banished to the St James' Park stands after the push . Heated: Martin O'Neill took exception to Pardew's over-zealous celebrations in the 2011 Tyne-Wear derby . November 2006: Pardew had earlier in the year criticised Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger for failing to field an English player in the Champions League match against Real Madrid and matters came to a head in West Ham's 1-0 win over Arsenal. Then West Ham boss Pardew's enthusiastic celebrations appeared to irritate Wenger, who claimed he was 'provoked in a disrespectful way', with the pair having to be kept apart by the fourth official. On this occasion, it was the Gunners boss who was fined by the Football Association, with Pardew cleared of all charges. March 2012: In a Tyne-Wear derby, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the tension boiled over, with Pardew, now Newcastle boss, clashing with Martin O'Neill following his celebration to Shola Ameobi's late equaliser in a heated match. Both managers pledged afterwards to keep their emotions in check in future. August 2012: Pardew came under severe criticism and then afterwards labelled his behaviour 'ridiculous' when he shoved linesman Peter Kirkup in the Magpies' season opener against Tottenham after disagreeing with the official's decision to award Spurs a throw-in. Pardew once again apologised for his actions but the Football Association took a dim view and hit him with a two-match touchline ban and a £20,000 fine. January 2014: Pardew became involved in another touchline row, less than a month after having heated words with Southampton boss Pochettino, with Manchester City manager Pellegrini. Television cameras clearly showed the Newcastle boss launching an expletive-laden volley at the Chilean. Pardew was spared punishment but said later: 'It was a heat of the moment thing, words we always have as managers, to a degree. I've apologised and I'm fortunate that he's accepted that.'","The Football Association are considering an appeal after Alan Pardew was given a seven-match ban for headbutting Hull's David Meyler .

Bayern Munich star Arjen Robben told Arsene Wenger he should act with more class after being described as a 'great diver' by the Arsenal boss. The Holland international hit back at the Gunners boss in the wake of the German club's 3-1 Champions League victory at the Allianz Arena, in which Robben won a late penalty. The spot kick was saved by Lukasz Fabianksi, but Wenger waded in after the match, prompting a robust response from the Dutchman. VIDEO Scroll to the bottom to see Robben's recent Bundesliga hat-trick against Schalke . Making his point: Arjen Robben told Arsene Wenger to act with more class following the Frenchman's comments . Unimpressed: Arsenal boss Wenger described Bayern winger Robben as being a 'great diver' Down: Robben won a late penalty for Bayern after going down under the challenge of Laurent Koscielny . Robben said: 'I always say if you are a big manager then take your loss… if you win be happy, enjoy, but if you lose don't complain about silly things. 'It was two penalties but I don't want to defend myself. 'From a big manager you expect a little bit more.' Despite Arsenal’s spirited performance, Wenger had complained that Robben, who won a penalty at the Emirates when Wojciech Szczesny was sent off, dived again in the 52nd minute after a challenge by Santi Cazorla. Wenger said: ‘He is a very good diver, but that is the way it goes. It is the referee - Robben is a fantastic player, but he doesn’t need to do it. He gets in front of the player, he goes down. We spoke about this yesterday. If the referee gives him a yellow card he will not do it again.’ Wenger remains convinced that Szczesny’s dismissal was the reason Bayern progressed to the quarter-finals. Not this time: Referee Svein Oddvar Moen waved away Robben's appeals during the opening stages of the second half after the Dutchman went down under the challenge of Santi Cazorla . The Arsenal chief added: ‘We had a good chance to win the game. I believe that in the second half the opportunities were there but overall over the two games I feel the major decision was the one to send our keeper off. ‘Good luck to Bayern because they are a good side but this season they were more vulnerable. We have regrets. In the last five years we have twice played Barcelona, twice Bayern and they are at the top of their game every time. ‘Every time in the last two years at home we have been very harshly done by. Away from home we have not lost for a long time in Germany but at home we have been caught. Just in time: Lukas Fabianski saved Thomas Muller's injury-time penalty before denying the German the chance to score from the rebound . Wenger also confirmed that the club made an administrative error and were forced to name only six substitutes after realising Ryo Miyaichi was ineligible. Miyaichi was taken out of the Champions League squad when Arsenal signed Kim Kallstrom in the January transfer window in the mistaken belief that he was registered on the ‘B’ list. Wenger added: ‘We discovered too late he couldn’t play. I don’t think it would have made a difference.’ Error: Arsenal were forced to name only six substitutes after realising midfielder Ryo Miyaichi was ineligible . Mesut Ozil put in another dreadful display, then limped out of the action at half-time. The Germany midfielder suffered a hamstring injury and looks sure to miss a series of crucial Barclays Premier League matches, starting with Sunday’s north London derby against Tottenham. He was treated by Bayern and Germany doctor Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt at the break and will have a scan on Wednesday. Bastian Schweinsteiger put Bayern in front but Arsenal equalised when Lukas Podolski rifled an effort beyond Manuel Neuer. Lukasz Fabianski saved a late penalty from Thomas Muller to earn Arsenal a draw but they lost the tie 3-1 on aggregate. Despair: Arsenal's German international Mesut Ozil barely got into the game before limping off at half-time . Ozil was replaced by Tomas Rosicky at half-time and Wenger said: ‘He’s out for a few weeks. It is a hamstring injury and it looks quite serious. I don’t know how long and we hope it’s not so bad.’ In the half that he was on the pitch, Ozil had just 21 touches of the ball. To put that into perspective Thiago Alcantara, in the heart of Bayern’s midfield, had 66. Want more? Bastian Schweinsteiger 47, Arjen Robben 33, Franck Ribery 33. The exuberance has deserted him just when his team-mates are looking to the former Real Madrid ace for inspiration. The days when he drifted in and out of games with Real are behind him. Now he just looks like a lost soul, lazy and uninterested. Meanwhile, Chelsea target Diego Costa stayed in his rich vein of form with a double as Atletico Madrid thumped seven-times European Cup winners AC Milan 4-1 (5-1 on aggregate) to secure a place in the quarter-finals. Acrobatic: Chelsea target Diego Costa Costa gave Atletico Madrid the perfect start by scoring a volley early on .","Arsene Wenger called Arjen Robben a 'very good diver' after the 1-1 draw .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 11:17 EST, 11 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:14 EST, 11 March 2014 . Interest rates could rise in months before the general election, regeardles on the impact on voters, Mark Carney revealed today. The Bank of England governor said it would be ‘a welcome time’ when rates do rise from their record lows, but other factors would play a part in deciding when to begin an increase. Mr Carney struck an upbeat tone, claiming the ‘end of the recovery is in progress’ but Britain will continue to face ‘extraordinary times’ for many years. Bank of England governor Mark Carney told the Treasury select committee it would be a 'welcome time' when rates do rise . Bank of England interest rates have been at 0.5 per cent for more than five years as a result of the financial crash and the recession which followed. Mr Carney had set a target of unemployment falling to 7 per cent before he would consider increasing the cost of borrowing, but six months later strong jobs growth meant that figure has almost been reached already. Today he argued that the better-than-expected recovery would mean the prospect of a rise in the cost of borrowing was now a ‘welcome’ possibility. But he rejected the idea that the timing of the general electon, due on May 7, 2015, would play a part. A rise in interest rates ahead of polling day would be a boost for savers who have seen £300billion  wiped off the value of their nest eggs. There is a 'distinct possibility' that the Royal Bank of Scotland would have to move outside of Scotland if voters back independence, Mark Carney warned. MPs were also told that the rest of the UK was likely to end up bailing out Scotland in the event of a crisis if there was a currency union even if there were explicit guarantees written into an agreement ruling out such an event. European laws that require banks to have their head offices in the same member state as their registered offices would be likely to hit Scotland, the Treasury select committee heard. Asked if RBS would have to move to the remaining UK if an independent Scotland joined the EU, Mr Carney said: 'It's a distinct possibility but I shouldn't prejudge it. 'It depends on their arrangements as well, if they were to adjust more into Scotland the minor management of the institution.' It came amid claims an independent Scotland could face a deficit at least £3 billion greater than Alex Salmond has claimed. The Scottish Government has estimated that the country would have a deficit of 3.2 per cent of GDP, or £5.5 billion, but that figure is up to 2.2 per lower than projections by other organisations including think tanks, Citi Group and the Treasury. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said Mr  Salmond's position was 'bereft of any credibility' as he urged the nation not to 'walk away from one of the most successful political, economic and social unions that the world has ever seen'. But homeowners could suddenly find . themselves faced with bigger mortgage bills as they ponder whether they . want David Cameron or Ed Miliband in Number 10. Earlier . this year Martin Weale, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, . suggested it would be ‘difficult’ for rates to rise during the election . campaign. But Mr Carney . insisted the timing would not be affected by politics. He told MPs: . ‘When the time comes - a welcome time - to raise rates, we expect it to . be gradual and the degree to be limited . ‘We . will still be living in extraordinary times a few years down the road,"" he added, referring to the slow recovery in Europe, emerging market . turmoil and higher borrowing costs in financial markets.' The central bank boss told the Treasury Select Committee his flagship forward guidance policy had helped drive the bounce back in the economy, despite having to abandon linking rates to unemployment after just six months. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said the Bank appeared to be ‘back to where it started’ with rate-setting based on a variety of economic indicators, as it was before forward guidance was first introduced last August. The pledge to link rates to unemployment had been well understood by businesses, giving them confidence to make hiring and spending decisions, which has in turn boosted the recovery, he said. Mr Carney added: ‘We are moving to a period where the end of the recovery is in progress and the start of expansion should happen this year and we are moving to a period where the more conventional operation of monetary policy is a possibility, which is welcome.’ He admitted the Bank's forecasts had been woefully wrong, having first predicted unemployment would not reach 7 per cent until 2016 - a threshold that is set to be hit within months. It has been holding an internal review of its forecasting capability and is set to report the findings next week, he said. The Bank last week held rates once more, marking the five-year anniversary of its decision to slash rates to the historic low of 0.5 per cent. But members of the MPC have repeatedly signalled that rates may rise next year as the economic recovery picks up pace, with the market expecting a hike at the start of the second quarter. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls warned that Mr Carney may be forced to raise interest rates earlier than he wishes by the ‘lopsided’ housing market, which has seen prices rise much faster in London and the South East than in other parts of the country. Mr Balls urged the Government to build more houses to bring demand for homes more in line with supply. And he called for a cut in the £600,000 limit for support under the Help to Buy scheme.","Bank of England Governor says it will be a 'welcome time' when rates rise .

Warning: Mark Carney told the Treasury Select Committee a 'Yes' vote could have a major impact on RBS . Royal Bank of Scotland could be forced to move to England if voters north of the border back independence, Mark Carney said yesterday. The Bank of England Governor told MPs there is a ‘distinct possibility’ that RBS would have to leave an independent Scotland. He also said taxpayers in the rest of the UK would be forced to bail out Scotland in the event of crisis if it was allowed to keep the pound. The comments were a further setback for Alex Salmond and the ‘Yes’ campaign ahead of the referendum in September. Mr Salmond, First Minister of the Scottish Government and leader of the Scottish National Party, wants to create a ‘sterling zone’ with the rest of the UK if the country goes it alone. But Chancellor George Osborne has already ruled out a currency union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK in a move backed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. And firms including Standard Life and Alliance Trust have warned that they may move south of the border if Scotland votes to go it alone. Giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee yesterday, Mr Carney raised the prospect of Scotland’s biggest bank deserting the country after independence. Asked if RBS would have to move, the central bank chief said: ‘It is a distinct possibility.’ European law dictates that banks have their headquarters in states where they do most of their business and have the most customers. But both RBS and Lloyds do more business in England than in Scotland - raising the prospect that they will have to move if Scotland declares independence. Mr Carney also told MPs that any ‘informal adoption of sterling’ by an independent Scotland without an agreed currency union would mean the Bank of England could no longer stand behind its banks. And he suggested the rest of the UK could end up bailing out Scotland if it was hit by a financial crisis. European law dictates that banks have their headquarters in states where they do most business . He said ‘when push came to shove’ stricken countries in the eurozone had to be rescued despite a ‘no-bailout clause’. The Canadian said: ‘Would it be credible to stand by if an independent Scotland were to be in fiscal difficulties?’ But Mr Carney dismissed claims that he thought a currency union was a bad idea for the UK. ‘I have been absolutely clear and I will continue to be clear that what I have tried to do, what the Bank has tried to do, and what we will continue to do is to draw attention to economic issues which the interested parties can address and then others can make the judgments,’ he told MPs. ‘At no time have I said, or will I say, that I do not support or that I advocate a currency union, either side of the debate.’ The move would be a blow for Alex Salmond who wants to create a 'sterling zone' A spokesman for the pro-union Better Together campaign said: ‘This is an important contribution from the Bank of England Governor. 'What people in Scotland need is clarity from Alex Salmond about his Plan B for what would replace the pound. Would we have to sign up to the euro, as Mark Carney said, or would we set up an unproven separate currency? ‘No doubt Alex Salmond’s response will be the same as every other time an expert has questioned his plans - Mark Carney is wrong and only the First Minister is right. It simply isn’t credible.’ SNP MP Stewart Hosie, the party’s Treasury spokesman and a member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘I am pleased that the Governor took this opportunity to confirm the Bank of England’s neutrality on the issue of Scottish independence.’","European law dictates bank must be based in state it does most business .

Abby Putterill, 16, whose parents run an animal sanctuary 40km from the capital Harare, says Hammy, a mopane squirrel, climbed into her tied-up hair one day and decided to stay. The schoolgirl and her furry companion have been together for two months - and he is thriving. Abby Putterill shows how her furry friend Hammy has made a home for himself in her hair . Hammy was just days old when he was found on the cold office floor of the Bally Vaughan Wildlife Sanctuary. Abby's mother Debbie Putterill, who co-owns the park with husband Gordon, took the baby back to her home. To the amazement of the family, Hammy made for her daughter, climbed on to her head and snuggled in to her hair. Abby wears her hair in a loose ponytail which she usually has tied up at the back, making a wonderful home-from-home for Hammy. Hammy was severely injured when he was found at the Bally Vaughan Wildlife Sanctuary near Harare . Barring sleeping and showering, the squirrel and the schoolgirl are practically inseparable. Mrs Putterill said: 'He's doing really well and is growing up so quickly. 'When we first found him he was lying on the concrete floor of the office. He must have fallen out of the thatched roof after being abandoned. 'If we hadn't taken him in he would have died because he was only around ten days old.' The youngster was nursed back to health on a diet of baby formula and cereal, regaining his strength and quickly becoming a member of the family. Abby Putterill is a keen animal lover and is inseparable from little Hammy . Mrs Putterill added: 'When he was tiny he refused to sleep anywhere else but on the palm of your hand but as he got older he started treating us like trees, burrowing under our clothes. 'But one day he was playing with Abby and he managed to crawl into her hair. He seemed to make himself at home and still does it now. 'We've never had a squirrel do this before and it's really quite funny to see but he's happy enough to lie there and watch the world go by.'

Promotions for payday loans that suggest they could fund shopping sprees, birthday celebrations or buying an engagement ring have been branded irresponsible. Citizens Advice has compiled a list of marketing initiatives that may have broken advertising rules. Alleged breaches across TV ads, texts, emails, flyers and even on a sandwich wrapper include not declaring the cost of a loan – which can top 5,000 per cent APR interest – and suggesting frivolous uses. Investigation: Wonga is one of six companies accused of 'frivolous' advertising exposed to children . The Advertising Standards Authority and Financial Conduct Authority are to investigate the claims, which involve six lenders including Wonga, PoundstoPocket and Peachy.co.uk. Firms have also been accused of trying to normalise loans through daytime TV ads when children are watching. Citizens Advice wants a ban on ads that trivialise the loans by suggesting they can be used for treats. Chief executive Gillian Guy said: ‘Animations, cheery puns and suggestions that loans could fund a shopping spree are a far cry away from the reality of payday lending many of our clients’ experience.’ A birthday email from Pounds to Pocket implied a short term loan could be used to pay for birthday celebrations. The firm KDS Finance Love2shop was issuing voucher flyers suggesting its short-term loans could be used for shopping, which Citizens Advice said was irresponsible and trivialised taking out a loan. Citizens Advice warn people are tricked into believing they can borrow money for simple treats . A TV commercial for Wonga set in a café suggested a loan could be taken out to cope with unspecified ‘financial quandaries’ and failed to show the cost of the loan. A promotional film made by the same company featuring 12 case studies of people who had borrowed from the company has also been criticised. Citizens Advice said it did not contain any details on interest rates, while it implied one of its loans was a suitable way to pay for an engagement ring. Peachy.co.uk ran adverts for its loans on sandwich wrappers. Citizens Advice said it is irresponsible to promote borrowing in this way and that the ad made unsubstantiated claims the firm’s loans were cheaper than available elsewhere. The chief executive of Citizens Advice has said that every day the charity had to help deal with the 'devastation caused by irresponsible payday lending' (file picture posed by models) A text message from loan-monarch suggested the company gives money to 98per cent of people who apply. However the firm is actually a credit broker which passes on applicants to other companies and does not provide loans directly. Similarly, a text message from spends4u.co.uk claimed a loan could be approved ‘today’, when it is also a credit broker, rather than a loans company. The message said a loan could be offered ‘no matter what your circumstances’, which was either misleading or ‘very irresponsible’. One of the key concerns about these loans is that they have been given to people who have no means of making repayments, so leaving them open to penalty charges. Miss Guy said: ‘Day in day out Citizens Advice is helping people deal with the devastation caused by irresponsible payday lending. ‘Loans taken out to cover a short-fall have turned into a long-term nightmare as people struggle to keep up with payments, and high charges increase debts further.’ She added: ‘Borrowing money is a very serious step and people need to be aware of all of the facts before they sign-up.  Consumers cannot make informed decisions if the adverts are irresponsible and misleading. ‘The complaints made today are a strong reflection on the public distaste for financial products that exploit people and drive individuals deep into debt. ‘We’d like to thank those who have taken time to make a stand against irresponsible adverts by reporting them to Citizens Advice and encourage others to tell us about other inappropriate adverts.’ 'Borrowing money is a very serious step . and people need to be aware of all of the facts before they sign-up. Consumers cannot make informed decisions if the adverts are . irresponsible and misleading' - Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy . Citizens Advice has long been calling for health warning on payday loan adverts. It also wants financial services companies to be banned from cold calling which would mean payday lenders could not text, email or ring people out of the blue offering them loans. As part of the charity’s campaign to clean-up the payday loan industry, Citizens Advice has been pressing authorities to take action on irresponsible advertising and Chief Executive Gillian Guy has spoken out about the use of celebrities, such as Kerry Katona, to endorse financial products. The ASA will take evidence from the companies to defend the promotions before it rules whether they broke industry advertising rules. The organisation has indicated it is willing to ban payday loan ads which trivialise borrowing. The firms insisted all of their marketing is checked to ensure it meets industry rules before it goes public. Wonga said: ‘As a responsible business, our advertising is rigorously checked before it is aired and we look forward to engaging with the ASA should they have concerns.’ The founder of Peachy, Kristjan Novitski, said: ‘As a company we have spent a lot of time, energy and money on ensuring we maintain rigorous standards. ‘Although we do not agree that our advert presents a casual attitude to taking out a loan, nor does it suggest that a loan with us is cheaper than elsewhere, we will look into the complaint as a matter of urgency to ensure that any future advertising does not cause similar confusion.’","Branding on TV, texts, and sandwich wrappers 'breach rules', it is claimed .

The capital of the Anglo-Saxon kings buried at Sutton Hoo may have been uncovered in farmland close to the famous burial mounds. Archaeologists believe a royal settlement once spread across more than 100 acres of what is now farmland at Naunton Hall in Rendlesham near Woodbridge, Suffolk. They say it included a wooden palace which would have been used by King Raedwald and other Anglo-Saxon rulers of Norfolk and Suffolk between the 6th and 9th Centuries. Hidden treasure: Archaeologists believe they have found an ancient royal settlement which once spread across more than 100 acres of what is now farmland at Naunton Hall in Rendlesham near Woodbridge, Suffolk . It was only discovered after the owner of the land raised the alarm when illegal treasure hunters started scouring the area under the cover of night. The site is only around four miles from the treasure-filled Sutton Hoo burial ship which is thought to be the grave of Raedwald who died in about 624 AD. Rumours of a royal settlement in Rendelsham have persisted since it was first mentioned by the Venerable Bede, an 8th century monk and historian. But it is only now that archaeologists have unearthed what they describe as 'conclusive evidence' to pinpoint the land where the settlement stood for around 300 years. A series of Anglo-Saxon coins, fragments of gold jewellery, buckles, pieces of brooches and part of a hanging bowl have been found in the fields over the past five years, indicating that a village was once there. A Visigothic gold tremissis coin from the late 6th century was also uncovered along with weights, suggesting that the site was an important base for foreign trade. Another find of an unfinished bronze buckle is being seen as evidence of a metal workshop on the site. Coins found at the Rendlesham site: Last night the National Trust confirmed in a statement that the finds represented 'conclusive evidence of the existence of the long-lost Royal settlement at Rendlesham' Suffolk County Council began investigations along with the Sutton Hoo Society and English Heritage after illicit treasure hunters with metal detectors targeted fields around Rendlesham in night-time raids in 2009. After Sir Michael Bunbury alerted the authorities to evidence of the so-called 'night hawks' targeting his land, trusted volunteers with metal detectors were allowed to scan the fields for anything of archaeological value. Over five years the search uncovered 15 silver Anglo-Saxon coins in one field, including one used as an ornament. Another two Anglo-Saxon sceattas, a type of ancient coin from the 8th century, were found in another field along with silver and copper-alloy brooch fragments. A copy of a 7th century tremissis coin and an 8th century handle-shaped brooch were found in a third area. Rich history: Rumours of a royal settlement in Rendelsham have persisted since it was mentioned by the Venerable Bede in the 8th Century . Other finds included coins from the Roman era, evidence of an Iron Age enclosure and early medieval trinkets, suggesting the site was occupied for hundreds of years before and after Anglo-Saxon times. Last night the National Trust confirmed in a statement that the finds represented 'conclusive evidence of the existence of the long-lost Royal settlement at Rendlesham'. A statement said that archaeologists had surveyed 400 acres of land in the search for the settlement. The investigation identified the 125 acre site by metal-detecting, aerial photography, chemical analysis and geophysics - a process of scanning the ground beneath the surface for evidence of buried features. The Trust said that finds included 'fragments of exquisite gold jewellery, Saxon pennies and weights associated with trade, and metal offcuts from a smith's workshop'. The Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History, which helped identify the finds, described them as 'conclusive evidence of the long-lost Anglo-Saxon royal settlement whose people buried their kings at Sutton Hoo'. A spokesman for the institute described the site as being of 'huge historical and archaeological significance'. The find has been described as possibly the most significant for Anglo-Saxon history since the 1939 discovery of the burial ship at Sutton Hoo. Investigations of the 27m long ship led . to the rewriting of Anglo-Saxon history as it emerged that craftsmen . from the era were much more advanced than previously thought. The treasures found there included included gild and gem-encrusted dress fittings, an ornate ceremonial helmet, shield and sword, as well as pieces of silver plate from Byzantium. At this new site, while the exact location of the suspected royal palace has not been pinpointed, archaeologists are convinced it would have been there. Bede wrote in his 8th-Century book, An Ecclesiastical History of the English People, that it was 'the king's country-seat of Rendlesham'. It is believed that in the 7th century the settlement would have equalled Ipswich in size before going into decline two centuries later when Ipswich became the main regional centre. Similarities: A gilded bronze mount from a harness found at Rendlesham, which is similar to an example from one of the Sutton Hoo burials. The discovery of the 27m long ship led to the rewriting of Anglo-Saxon history . Mike Argent, chairman of the Sutton Hoo Society, said archaeologists working on the project were 'very excited' about what has been unearthed. The site of two 6th- and 7th-Century cemeteries, Sutton Hoo's discovery shed light on a period of England's past on the margin between myth, legend and historical documentation. Use of the site culminated at a time when RÃ¦dwald, the ruler of the East Angles, held power among the English people and played a dynamic if ambiguous part in the establishment of Christian rulership in England. It is generally thought most likely that he is the person found in the undisturbed ship burial, that held a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artefacts. Excavated in 1939, the ship is one of the most magnificent archaeological finds in England. The investigations are expected to carry on for at least another year, with much scientific work to be done and the papers detailing the finds still to be written. Mr Argent said the finds suggested the area was a settlement, meeting place or trading station for a variety of Saxon people including those of high-status, probably kings. He said the investigations took place around the diary of the working farm, waiting until fields had been harvested, with a team of four authorised and responsible metal detector enthusiasts combing the fields. 'The finds are extremely interesting. They consist of mainly tiny pieces, not the big sparkly stuff discovered at the ship burial,' he added. 'But the finds show there has been human activity at the site over a long period, high status activity. It doesn't confirm one way or another that there was a big royal palace - it doesn't show there was and it doesn't mean there wasn't one. 'It shows there were high-status people at the site and there was trading with places that were very far away. It is fascinating and very exciting.' Archaeologists work at the Sutton Hoo site: Painstaking excavations of the burial ship led to the rewriting of Anglo-Saxon history as it emerged that craftsmen from the era were much more advanced than thought . A burial mound at Sutton Hoo: The site of two 6th- and 7th-Century cemeteries, Sutton Hoo's discovery shed light on a period of England's past on the margin between myth, legend and historical documentation. Judith Plouviez, lead archaeological officer at Suffolk County Council for the project, said there was an 'exceptional Anglo-Saxon settlement here, and that it was flourishing at the time of Raedwald'. Sir Michael Bunbury, 67, who owns the land where the settlement has been found, said: 'The area is on a number of fields which are now used for growing wheat, barley and oil seed rape. 'My understanding is that there would have been people leaving here and people of high status, like kings, would visit. It is an on-going scientific and archaeological investigation.' A map shows the relative locations of Rendlesham and the burial mounds of Sutton Hoo in Suffolk . Richard Smith, the Suffolk County Council cabinet member for Economic Development, Environment and Planning said: 'We are very grateful to Sir Michael Bunbury who alerted us to on-going illicit looting on his land and has allowed the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service and the metal detecting team regular access to his fields. 'From the start it was clear that this site produced exceptionally important finds that could relate to the royal settlement cited in Bede. 'The combination of the exemplary work by the detector users with other survey methods is allowing us to build a detailed picture of past activity, including international trade and fine metalworking.' Intricate: A helmet found at Sutton Hoo which is thought to date back to about 625 AD . Royal shoulder-clasps decorated with inlaid gold, enamel and garnet, found in the burial mounds at Sutton Hoo . Professor Christopher Scull, of Cardiff University and University College London said: 'The survey has identified a site of national and indeed international importance for the understanding of the Anglo-Saxon elite and their European connections. 'The quality of some of the metalwork leaves no doubt that it was made for and used by the highest ranks of society.

A lucky Briton could be leaving the bank with a smile on their face tomorrow after collecting a £107,932,603.20p cheque which will make them one of the richest people in the country. A person has now stepped forward to claim the EuroMillions jackpot prize and a lottery spokesperson has confirmed that the money could be withdrawn from the bank tomorrow. The identity of the ticket-holder, who scooped the first EuroMillions jackpot to be won in the UK this year, is still unknown. Scroll down for video . The lucky winner's wealth now exceeds that of musicians Robbie Williams, left, and George Michael, right, who both have reported fortunes of £105million . The Briton, who has not yet come forward, chose the winning numbers on Friday night's lottery. A National Lottery spokesman said: 'We're delighted Friday's ticket-holder has come forward to claim this . amazing prize. 'This massive win ranks fourth biggest on the National .

'With the . weather set fair for the coming week, this UK winner is set fair for the . rest of their lives having just become a multi-millionaire. ‘This single UK ticket-holder will enter the exclusive top five on the National Lottery Rich List – at No 4.’ But the mystery winner's identity is still unknown and may never be revealed. The spokesman said: 'The ticket holder can then decide whether to go public and share their news. 'There will be no information on whether it is an individual or syndicate winner, or where the ticket was purchased unless the ticket holder decides to go public.' According to the Sunday Times Rich List for 2013, their new found-fortune automatically makes them the 745th richest person in the UK. Their wealth exceeds that of musicians George Michael (£105million), Robbie Williams (£105million)  and David Bowie (£100million). The main numbers were 6, 24, 25, 27 and 30, with the lucky star numbers 5 and 9. It means they take home a princely £107,932,603. The life-changing sum could help the winner buy their own Greek island such as Omfori, currently being advertised for just over £41 million, a Lamborghini Veneno, one of the world's most expensive cars at a cost of £2.4 million, and still have plenty left to spend.

Or the winner could splash most of the money in a single purchase to buy a 21-bedroom home in London's Mayfair, which is on the market for £90 million. Top of the National Lottery Rich List are Colin and Chris Weir, who banked a £161 million EuroMillions jackpot in July 2011. In that time, 38 UK ticket-holders have matched five numbers and two Lucky Stars to win the jackpot, or a share of it. The winning ticket-holder of last night's EuroMillions has shot to sixth place on the National Lottery Rich List. So far, nobody has come forward to claim the bumper prize, Camelot said.

Walsh, 57, James Bennett, 28, Sean Connor, 32, Alex Parry, 19, Emma . Cartwright, 23, Ceri Scullion, 35, and Donna Rhodes, 39, each banked . £6.5million. Sunseeker superyacht . If a life on the ocean waves appeals then yesterday's winner should get hold of the latest Sunseeker catalogue. The Dorset company's brand new 155 model would be a ideal choice but at a cool £32million it would take a large chunk out of their new found fortune. Boasting five bedrooms, enabling then to host up to 10 guests at once, the four-deck yacht also has space for 11 members of staff. Other perks include a nightclub, day room, 'beach club' and a panoramic viewing platform - which could allow guests a perfect view of the Monaco Grand Prix if Mr Jordan decides to attend the society event. The yacht is 155ft long and weighs a total of 200 tonnes, with a maximum speed of 22 knots (25mph), and can travel 4,000 nautical miles in a single journey. Filling up the boat's 60,000-litre engine with diesel will cost £30,000 every time. Rolls Royce Phantom . Lottery winners and Rolls Royce are the perfect match and a top of the range Phantom model is easily within budget at £300,000. The Phantom is a classic choice for the super rich, and they are all assembled by hand at the Rolls-Royce factory in Goodwood, West Sussex. A-list celebrities David Beckham, Simon Cowell, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone and Eddie Murphy have all been spotted riding in the car. It is also a favourite of the royal family and heads of state worldwide – an earlier version of the Phantom was presented to the Queen as a gift on her Silver Jubilee. However, to get the full experience they would need to add a chauffeur. Private Island . Flashy cars, superyachts and private jets are all very well, but to really join ranks of the super rich you'll need a private Island. And they could do a lot worse than the stunning Greek Island of Omfori. The uninhabited island located in the Ionian Sea covers some 4 500 000 sq metres (1112 acres) and is currently up for sale for £40million. Widely considered one of the most beautiful islands in the region, it features a beautiful beach surrounded by tranquil turquoise waters. Private jet . First class just doesn't cut the mustard when you've got £100 million burning a hole in your pocket so a private jet is really the only way to fly. Learjet are the market leaders and we think their 60xr model would be the sensible choice. With a range of 2,405 nautical miles it shoud be easily capable of taking then and three passengers wherever they want to go. The cabin is decked out with leather and walnut veneer and it's easily within budget at £8million. A flat at One Hyde Park . It is the most expensive block of flats in the world with entry level apartments starting at £5million and the penthouse going for eyewatering £65million. Buyers will join a roll call of billionaire residents, including developer Christian Candy, who owns two properties at One Hyde Park. The property tycoon, who built the apartments with his brother Nick, owns two separate flats worth £31m and £26.2m on the 10th floor.Two other apartments were sold for a combined £136 million to Ukrainian mining tycoon Rinat Akhmetov, who is thought to be investing a further £50 million to knock the properties together and refit them. - Do you know the EuroMillions winner?

Looking for a tasty peanut, the squirrel buried its face into a feeder in the shape of a horse's head. But the animal did not know that he was being caught on camera by Florida photographer Jim Zielinski, 43, who had posed up the shot in his back garden. The pictures were taken by Florida photographer Jim Zielinski who planned to take the perfect picture by suspending the feeder from a string and hiding a peanut inside . This is the hilarious moment a squirrel tucked his head into a feeder - shaped like a horse's head to munch on a peanut hidden inside it . Mr Zielinski, from Florida, went to great lengths to capture the perfect shot by making holes in the horse head feeder before suspending it from the branches of a tree in his back garden in the Sunshine State. But what started out as a fun project has now become an internet sensation with Jim's pictures racking up over 1.5 million views online. He said: 'As soon as I saw the feeder online I knew I had get some photos, I started setting it up pretty much immediately after it arrived. 'We currently have about seven squirrels living near our house, I knew it wouldn't be long before one arrived because there are usually a few waiting for us to come out and toss a few peanuts. 'The branch I tied it to was right above where we feed the squirrels by hand so they are used to eating there.' Mr Zielinski quickly thought of how he could suspend the feeder from a branch and capture the hilarious scene. He said: 'I decided to put a hole in the back of the horse head and tie another line to hold it straight, by doing that I managed to suspend it in the air. The feeder looks up towards the horse's head which he knows has a tasty peanut hidden inside. Florida photographer Jim Zielinski said that the squirrels are used to being fed from this spot . Got it: The squirrel tucks into the peanut after rising to the challenge of tucking his head into a horse mask to get hold of his lunch . 'Initially, I thought of it as a gimmick and once it arrived I saw it as a challenge.' But although the photographer had taken up the challenge of getting the animal to eat from the horse head he did not think he would be able to capture the moment on camera. He said: 'I nearly fell in the pool laughing when I saw I got the shots because I honestly wasn't even sure they would ever actually go for it. 'As soon as I checked the camera I lost it, I ran into the house yelling to my fiancé 'I got the shot! He actually ate from the feeder'. 'I was completely surprised and very excited to see the image on so many of the websites I check regularly, last time I checked it had over 1.5 million views.'","A squirrel tucks his head into the feeder to get his claws on a peanut .

The teenage mother of a  one-year-old girl in foster care who went missing during a supervised visit has been arrested on suspicion of kidnap after the child was found safe and well, police said today. Little Lola Page, 13 months, was found with her mother, Stacey Ball, 18, at an address in Willenhall, near Walsall in the West Midlands at 1am today, police said.  The child had been missing since Friday lunchtime, when she disappeared during a visit by her mother to the foster family she had been living with. Officers arrested Ball and another man at the address where they found them, and a short while later arrested two more men in the village of Walsall Wood, eight miles away. Stacey Ball, 18, has been arrested after police found her with Lola, 13 months, in Willenhall, West Midlands . Ball had been visiting her daughter, who was in foster care in Willenhall, when the child went missing on Friday . Ball, from Walsall Wood, was arrested on suspicion of kidnap, and the man she was arrested with is accused of assisting an offender.  The other two men are accused of conspiracy to kidnap. All four are now in police custody and officers said they were planning to question them later today. Detective Chief Inspector Matt Markham from West Midlands CID said the police had received several calls from members of the public wanting to help them trace the missing girl. He said: 'We are pleased to say that Lola is now returned to a place of safety and she is doing well. 'We have four people in police custody, helping us with our enquiries, regarding the childâ€™s kidnap and they will be questioned later today.' Lola was in foster care because of an alleged violent relationship between Miss Ball and Lola's father . West Midlands Police said the child had been 'taken to a place of safety' when they found her this morning . A police hunt for Lola and her mother was launched on Friday after the child, who was in the care of social services, was taken from her foster family during a supervised visit from her young mother. As police appealed for help in tracing the pair, Ball's father, Ryan Price, 46, said his daughter was upset because she had been told her child would be put up for adoption. He said: 'She had her baby taken away from her nine months ago and she has seen her three times a week since. 'But . then when social services told her she was up for adoption she was . desperate. She didn't think she would see her again and no one was . listening to her. She has been doing everything that they have asked of her and she is a good mum.

Stacey Ball with her one-year-old baby daughter Lola Page, the day the child went missing from foster care . Mr Price claimed his daughter became involved with social services because of a violent relationship with the baby's father. 'She has done nothing,' he added. 'She is just a mother screaming out for help. 'We are really worried about her and the baby. She is my granddaughter.' Over the weekend Lola's . 23-year-old father Stephen Page, who admitted he had not seen his . daughter 'for about five months', denied acting violently . towards Miss Ball.

"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 20:30 EST, 17 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 05:23 EST, 18 March 2014 . Anger grew yesterday after it was revealed that a gardener who drained £200,000 from the accounts of a vulnerable elderly woman will escape punishment. The handyman used a ruling by the controversial Court of Protection to convince the confused 89-year-old to sign over control of her finances. But a judge said the Crown Prosecution Service was ‘not totally confident’ it could prove the unnamed handyman had committed a crime. A ruling by the Court of Protection allowed a gardener to take more than £200,000 from an 89-year-old woman . Legal experts yesterday described the decision not to pursue a case for theft or fraud as ‘astonishing’ and challenged the common sense of the rules that allowed him to get away scot free. MPs on both sides of the Commons also called for reforms to the Mental Capacity Act, under which the secretive court was set up. Dr David Green, a criminologist who has advised the Home Office and is director of the Civitas think-tank, said the CPS should have allowed a jury to decide whether the gardener’s behaviour was ‘acceptable’. He added: ‘This is a particularly astonishing case because on the surface it is a very clear-cut case of fraud and exploitation of a vulnerable person. ‘The most disturbing thing is that this case has not resulted in a charge in the criminal courts.’ The Mental Capacity Act was set up under Labour nine years ago to protect the elderly, sick and vulnerable. But it has come under increasing criticism. Last week peers said it had led to the wrongful imprisonment of tens of thousands of people in care homes. MPs and legal experts have blasted the court's 'astonishing' ruling and called for reforms of the court . They said it also  contained supposed safeguards which were ‘wilfully used to oppress individuals and to force decisions upon them’. The case involving the gardener was revealed in a ruling published by a judge at the Court of Protection. It said the Kent handyman acquired a Lasting Power of Attorney that enabled him to control the elderly woman’s finances, even though an NHS social worker had questioned his motives. Although he can no longer handle his employer’s money, he is estimated to have kept more than £60,000. Senior Judge Denzil Lush said the CPS felt unable to prove his guilt following a police investigation. The judge also decided not to publish the name of the gardener. Yesterday a spokesman for the judiciary at the Royal Courts of Justice defended that decision on the grounds that it protected the identify of a ‘vulnerable adult’. MPs joined criticism of the Mental Capacity Act last night. Since it was sanctioned by the Labour Government, the Court of Protection has sparked fears that mentally frail and vulnerable people will not be sufficiently protected . Senior Labour MP Jim Dobbin, who questioned the Act when it was before Parliament, said: ‘My concerns at the time were that individuals with reduced mental capacity would become victims of secret court decisions. This act needs amendment to protect vulnerable people, who must always be at the forefront of our concerns.’ Tory MP Douglas Carswell added: ‘This shows we should never trust secret courts and experts. The whole point of the Act and the Court of Protection is we should leave it to experts – and this is an example of the sort of thing that happens if you do. The Mental Capacity Act has unravelled. It was produced by a government that banged on about human rights, and then passed a law like this.’ The CPS confirmed yesterday that the Metropolitan Police had investigated the case but said it did not know how the decision not to prosecute was taken. A spokesman said: ‘We don’t have any record of who it went to at the CPS.’","He persuaded the vulnerable woman to sign over her bank accounts .

Even in death he had the last word. Yesterday a ‘beyond the grave’ interview recorded by Tony Benn was released following his death at the age of 88. In the extraordinary clip filmed 12 years ago, he thanked his family and late wife Caroline for their support, and said he always tried to speak his mind during his political career – but said he hoped that he had not caused offence. Mr Benn was interviewed by Channel 4 News in April 2002 – on the understanding that it would be broadcast after his death. He said: ‘As by definition I won’t be able to say this again, can I take this opportunity of thanking my family, my mother and father, and my two brothers, and above all Caroline who inspired me over the 50 years of our marriage and my children and grandchildren. ‘All the many, many other people who supported me, encouraged me and taught me so much. ‘And I hope that in return I encouraged them and that I didn’t give offence because I tried to speak my mind and that’s what you’ve got to do in politics. So thank you very much.’ Laughing he added: . ‘And I’ll check that on transmission’. Yesterday politicians from all sides paid tribute to the veteran Left-winger, a Labour MP for half a century who held four ministerial posts and remained a dedicated campaigner well into his 80s. Labour leader Ed Miliband praised Mr Benn as an ‘iconic figure of our age’. A critic of New Labour, Mr Benn supported the leadership of Mr Miliband. In fact, he was a regular visitor to Mr Miliband’s childhood home in Primrose Hill, North London, because he was friendly with his Marxist academic father Ralph and political activist mother Marion. In 1986, when Ed Miliband was 16, he spent his summer holiday working as an intern in Mr Benn’s basement study at his home in Holland Park. Mr Benn wrote of his young charge: ‘Very helpful. He has just taken his O-levels and is at a loose end.’ Thanks: Mr Benn delivered the message at his family. He is pictured here in the 1950s with his wife Caroline and (left to right) children Hilary, Joshua, Melissa and Stephen . He remained friendly with the Milibands over the years – although Ed and David had moved away from his ideas politically. In December 2000, Benn wrote in his diaries about ‘the boys’ living ‘entirely in the world of the prime minister’s advisers’. Ed Miliband said  yesterday: ‘Whether you agreed with him or disagreed with him, everyone knew where he stood and what he stood for.’ There were less kindly words from former foe Denis Healey, who beat Mr Benn by a tiny margin for the deputy Labour leadership in 1981. Former chancellor Lord Healey, 96, told Newsnight: ‘He was in my view an artificial Leftie. He was  trying to prove he was working class, he was very ashamed of his upper class background.’ He added: ‘There was quite a lot of bitterness because I felt he did the party enormous damage at that time, by the way he behaved, not just his views. He was extremely rude and offensive in what he said.’ Close friends: RMT leader Bob Crow (left), who also died this week, is pictured here alongside Benn. The RMT said the Labour veteran was a 'close personal friend' of Mr Crow . However, David Cameron praised Benn as a ‘magnificent writer, speaker, diarist and campaigner’. He said: ‘There was never a dull moment listening to him, even when you disagreed with every word he said.’ Gordon Brown called him a  ‘powerful, fearless, relentless  advocate for social justice and  people’s rights’. And Tony Blair said: ‘Even when I disagreed with him, I always had enormous respect for his brilliance, his passion and his commitment to the people of Britain.’ The RMT rail union said last night Mr Benn was ‘a close personal friend’ of its leader Bob Crow – who died on Tuesday – and a strong supporter of the union. Mr Benn was taken ill several weeks ago. In a statement his four children said he died at his home in Holland Park, West London, surrounded by his family. The statement added: ‘We are comforted by the memory of his long, full and inspiring life and so proud of his devotion to helping others as he sought to change the world for the better.’ His eldest son Stephen must now decide whether he wants to formally become the 3rd Viscount Stansgate, the title his father renounced. To do so he must apply to the Crown Office to be put on the Roll of Peers. However, he would have to wait for a vacancy in the House of  Lords caused by the death of one of the four remaining Labour hereditary peers. A ‘by-election’ to elect a  successor involves a vote by the remaining three. By GEOFFREY LEVY . He buried the ashes of his beloved wife Caroline under the trees in the front garden of the family home in Essex, marked with a bust of her head and a marble headstone inscribed with the words ‘Author, teacher and socialist’. Beneath the words, a space was left where his own name will now be inscribed. Behind Tony Benn’s implacable Left-wing beliefs, there was a deeply emotional family man of great tenderness and tearful sentimentality. Devoted: Tony Benn with Caroline in 1979. He proposed to her on this bench in 1949 . For example, he always sobbed at the final scene in the film The Railway Children – the moment when the engine’s steam clears to reveal the father coming home from prison and the children running towards him. Benn even persuaded Oxford City Council to sell him the wooden bench on which Caroline was sitting when he proposed to her in 1949, just nine days after they had met. He placed the seat, too, by her headstone, and would spend hours sitting there, wondering where she was and when he would join her. They had been married for 51 years and he never got over her death. ‘She was the greatest inspiration of my life,’ he said. ‘I think of her many times each day.’ ‘Love and friendship are the secret of happiness,’ he wrote. ‘When I got married, my dad’s advice was to keep a big balance of affection in the bank, because you’re going to need it.’ Long-serving: Tony and Caroline Benn campaigning in Bristol - November 1950 . Further back, in his childhood, he had sat on his grandmother’s bed when she was very ill and remembered her telling him: ‘The great thing about your last journey is that you don’t have to pack.’ He recalled Caroline’s view of death, too, as ‘a great adventure’. Her courage had a great influence on his own thinking about death, saying: ‘I’m not afraid of it – but I don’t want to go just yet.’ Caroline was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996 and died in November 2000, and the bleak emptiness Benn felt as a widower never left him. Once or twice, he admitted, his thoughts strayed to Dignitas, the Swiss-based euthanasia centre. What kept him going, though, was his four children and nine grandchildren, who he described as ‘an inspiration’. He once said: ‘My idea of a perfect day is to see all four of my children.’ They are Stephen, the eldest, who works for the Institute of Biology; Melissa, who has written novels; Joshua, who works for the homeless charity Crisis; and Hilary, Labour MP for Leeds Central and a member of the Shadow Cabinet. Political force: Benn and his wife campaigning in the 1984 Chesterfield by-election . Benn was thrilled when Hilary got a job in the Blair government as international development minister. Seeing how lost he was without Caroline, his children and their children did their best to cheer him up. There was the occasion when Melissa’s daughter, Sarah, recounted to her grandfather how he had taken her when she was much younger to watch a Harry Potter film. During a scene in which Harry opens a photo album and looks at his parents and himself as a small child, Tony Benn had burst into tears. On the way home, Sarah told him: ‘When you die, Dan-Dan, you will be in my heart, and now there is a piece of you in my heart already.’ There was never a day, either, when Caroline was not in Tony Benn’s heart and his thoughts. Now, they are together again.","Mr Benn, a Labour MP for more than 50 years, died yesterday aged 88 .

Flower thief: Wayne Mail, 49, arrives at Beverley Magistrates Court today ahead of his sentencing . Wayne Mail was proud of his garden and wanted to make it the best and brightest in the neighbourhood. Unfortunately for his neighbours, the 49-year-old found his plants by stealing from their flower beds rather than buying them from the garden centre, a court heard. He also helped himself to plants in public parks and on roundabouts. Mail lived with his poorly and widowed mother and he was determined to transform their garden to cheer her up. However, he eventually ended up in court. Marlene Stavers, a resident in the East Yorkshire village of Anlaby Common, became so concerned about her missing flowers she set mouse traps on the lawn and a CCTV camera to catch the crook. It worked and Mail was caught red-handed on camera. He was seen casually strolling into the neighbour’s garden with a bag in his hand, stooping down, scooping up handfuls of her finest plants and walking off. Police publicised the CCTV footage and Mail was quickly identified and arrested. Today he appeared before Beverley Magistrates’ Court and was sentenced to an 18 month community order with supervision and ordered to pay £85 compensation and a £60 victim surcharge. Caught on camera: Unfortunately for his neighbours, Mail found his plants by stealing from their flower beds rather than buying them from the garden centre, a court heard . Red (not green) handed: One resident in the East Yorkshire village of Anlaby Common, became so concerned about her missing flowers she set mouse traps on the lawn and a CCTV camera to catch the crook . Mail previously admitted six offences of stealing flowers, one of attempted theft and receiving stolen goods. PC Andy White, of Humberside Police, said: ‘He had a nice garden, but dozens of the plants had been stolen. 'We’ve investigated the theft of garden furniture and the odd garden ornament going missing, but this is the first time I’ve heard of plants taken like this.’ The police officer said: ‘He was stealing two or three plants at a time, usually from big displays in the hope a few missing plants wouldn’t be missed and would go unnoticed. ‘When he was arrested he was asked if there were any plants that shouldn’t be in his garden and he pulled out a box of plants.

Prince Charles claims the expense poured onto his 15-acre estate is a protest against 'fashionable vandalism' Prince Charles has admitted that critics may see his organic garden at Highgrove as an 'expensive indulgence', but insisted that it helps to heal 'damaged souls'. Launching an outspoken attack on the 'short-sighted' destruction of rare plants, fruit and vegetables, he defended the care and money he has lavished on the grounds of his country estate in Gloucestershire. Since buying Highgrove in 1980, Charles has transformed its once drab gardens by planting unusual British varieties of apples, restoring a wild flower meadow and allowing only natural fertilisers to be used. He said he saw his efforts as a reaction to the 'carnage of fashionable vandalism' that has left many once common shrubs, trees and farm animals on the endangered list. Writing in a foreword to a new book about his estate, the 65-year-old Prince said: 'In many ways the garden at Highgrove represents one very small attempt to heal the appallingly short-sighted damage done to the soil, the landscape and to our own souls. 'Some may not like it, others may scoff that it is not in the ""real world"" or is merely an expensive indulgence.' Highgrove's 15-acre grounds, which are open to visitors, also feature an 'ego garden' containing busts of Charles, a thatched tree house built for Princes William and Harry, and a 'stumpery' composed of dead trees. The new book, Highgrove: A Garden . Celebrated, by Bunny Guinness, which is published next month, reveals . that the Prince asked his gardeners to cut gaps in the yew hedges so his . security personnel could take short cuts while protecting him. The second in line to the throne has been adding rare apple trees and wild meadows to the land since 1980 . It is a 'very small attempt' to heal the damage done to our 'soil and souls', the prince writes in a new book. The young princes spent much of the year in the colourful Highgrove meadows with their parents Charles and Diana . Charles, pictured with his mother the Queen in Highgrove garden in 1998, once joked he talked to his plants . Charles famously once admitted that he talked to his plants, although last year he joked that he had changed this practice, telling an interviewer: 'Now I instruct them instead.' His criticism of trendy fads in gardening has echoes of his trenchant opposition to modern architecture, which he summed up by describing a planned extension to London's National Gallery as a 'monstrous carbuncle'.","Blasts 'carnage of fashionable vandalism' in new book about Highgrove .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:10 EST, 19 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 00:01 EST, 20 March 2014 . Texas police searching for a missing woman and her two children discovered a stash house on Wednesday, crammed full with more than 100 suspected illegal immigrants. The boarded up house in Houston was so full that the occupants were sitting on top of each other and were surrounded by trash bags filled with old clothing. It is thought many of the 108 men and women found inside the 1,500sq ft home had been brought there under a human smuggling operation. Discovery: Some of the occupants of the suspected stash house form lines outside as police investigate . The discovery was made as police . searched for a 24-year-old mother who had been reported missing along . with her seven-year-old daughter and five-year-old son. The woman's mother had contacted police after alleged people traffickers demanded more money before releasing the family, according to KHOU. When . police opened the door, they found a 'large, large group of people, . some sitting on top of one another, very confined spaces,' John Cannon, . of Houston Police Department said. Many of those found inside the filthy home, which had deadbolt locks on the doors, were dressed only in their underwear and had no shoes, possibly to make it harder for them to escape. Cannon . said the officers called out the name of the missing woman, and she . emerged with her two children. The three are said to be well. At first, officers saw only a mattress on the floor and a refrigerator in an exterior room. It was when they went further into the house that they found 94 men, 15 women and the missing family. All 108 occupants, who were crammed into several small rooms, shared one bathroom, and there was no hot water. Cramped: The men and woman found in the house claimed to have been there for days . Despair: Some of the occupants, believed to have come from Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, look dejected as police question them . Many of the women said they had been in the house for three or four days, Cannon said. One said she had been there for 15 days. All of them said they were hungry, thirsty and tired. 'It was just filth, very squalid-like conditions inside. Trash bags with clothing piled as high as you can see,' Cannon said. 'They were very surprised at the numbers of people inside. Some were just sitting on top of one another because there was just no room.' Five men have been arrested in connection with the suspected stash house. Houston police have handed the investigation over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE spokesman Greg Palmore said it has been five years since officials uncovered a house in the Houston area with this many people inside. In 2012, a house with 86 people was discovered, he said. The men and women found in the most recent case were taken into custody and will be questioned and fed, Palmore said. They were primarily from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador, he said. A pregnant woman and a man who were inside the house have been taken to a hospital for unknown treatment. Although Palmore said it was too early to say whether this was part of a human trafficking operation, he said it appeared to be that way. Houston is about seven hours from the Mexican border, making it a popular route for immigrants, Palmore said. Investigation: Police collect evidence and search some of the people found in the Houston home . Cramped conditions: A man is taken to hospital after being removed from the filthy house . 'Houston is significant for the highway corridors that make up Houston, I-45 and I-10. With those two traffic corridors you can pan out anywhere in the United States,' Palmore said. 'And it's very easy to assimilate into the communities here.' The home was found after Houston police were tipped off that the woman and children they were looking for may have been taken there. Cannon said police set up surveillance points outside the house early Wednesday and pulled over a car with two men inside for a routine traffic stop when they saw them leaving the driveway. Handguns and documents that suggested illegal activity were found in the car, leading police to detain the two men and enter the house, he said. After the people were removed and a count began, three men attempted to flee on foot, Cannon said. Those men have also been detained and are suspected of illegal activity as well. In addition, police found two coops with hundreds of chickens on the property that are part of an investigation into illegal cock-fighting, he said. Police have not identified the suspects.","Five arrested after 108 men and women are found in Houston home .

A Wall Street stockbroker and a clerk at a prominent Manhattan law firm have been charged with insider trading involving a middleman who would chew up napkins on which he passed illegal tips. Authorities say Steven Metro, 40, a managing clerk and non-practicing attorney at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, would pass tips about corporate mergers involving the firm's clients through the intermediary to Morgan Stanley stockbroker Vladimir Eydelman, 42. They allege that the four-year scheme earned the suspects more than $5.6million of illegal profit and $33million of illegal trades, with some profits being kicked back to Metro, and other profits spent by Eydelman on a home, jewelry and a $118,000 2011 Maserati GranTurismo. Financial scheme: Morgan Stanley stockbroker Vladimir Eydelman, 42, has been charged with insider trading . White-shoe law firm: Eydelman's alleged partner in crime was a managing clerk and non-practicing attorney at the prominent Manhattan law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett . The plot was uncovered after the go-between, who had become friends with Metro after meeting him in 1995 in their first year of law school, began cooperating with the FBI in December. U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman in New Jersey said transactions covered by the criminal complaint included a 2009 investment in Sirius XM Radio by Liberty Media Corp, and a 2013 merger of Office Depot Inc and OfficeMax Inc. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a related civil lawsuit against Eydelman and Metro. ‘Law firms are sanctuaries for the confidential treatment of client information,’ Daniel Hawke, chief of the SEC enforcement division's market abuse unit, said in a statement. ‘This scheme victimized not only a law firm but also its corporate clients and ultimately the investors in those companies.’ Eydelman, of Colts Neck, New Jersey, was charged with eight counts of securities fraud, and Metro, of Katonah, New York, was charged with nine counts. Each was also hit with four counts of tender offer fraud and one count of conspiracy. Morgan Stanley spokesman James Wiggins said the company has put Eydelman, formerly for Oppenheimer & Co., on leave, will cooperate with authorities, and does not tolerate insider trading. Speaking to Wall Street Journal, a representative for Simpson Thacher & Bartlett called the charges against Metro ‘deeply disturbing and unprecedented in our long history,’ adding that the law clerk has been terminated. Rendezvous: Prosecutors say the suspects'  middleman would meet Eydelman near the central clock in Grand Central Station and pass him a napkin or a Post-It bearing a stock tip . According to the complaint, Metro repeatedly accessed non-public information on Simpson Thacher's computer systems to identify documents establishing that a client of the firm was about to participate in a corporate transaction. He would then meet with the middleman, identified in court papers as a confidential witness, or ‘CW,’ in bars and cafes, and pass the information by showing it to him on his cell phone screen, Bloomberg BussinessWeek reported. Prosecutors said the middleman would in turn arrange a meeting with Eydelman near the central clock in Grand Central Station. They said the middleman would show Eydelman a napkin or piece of paper, such as a Post-It note, containing the ticker symbol of the stock that was to be purchased. Once Eydelman memorized the tip, ‘the CW then would fold up the paper or napkin with the ticker symbol(s) written on it, place it into his mouth, and chew' - and sometimes eat - the paper or napkin to destroy it as Eydelman watched, the criminal complaint said. Upscale home: Investigators said Eydelman used the illegal profits o buy a $1.8million mansion in Colts Neck, New Jersey . Authorities said the middleman this year began recording conversations with the defendants, including February 20 when Eydelman gave him a cigar box containing $7,000 meant for Metro, who wanted money to buy and renovate a home. ‘Take these cigars, put it to good use,’ Eydelman told the informant, according to the criminal complaint. According to the real estate site Trulia, in September 2009 – about six months into the alleged insider trading scheme - Eydelman purchased a 8,863-squate-foot in Colts Neck worth $1.9million. The case resembles a scheme that federal prosecutors in New Jersey said ran from 1994 to 2011, netted over $37 million of profit, and also involved a middleman who later cooperated. There, the lawyer Matthew Kluger was charged with passing merger tips to the trader Garrett Bauer, with the help of middleman Kenneth Robinson. Kluger was sentenced to 12 years in prison, Bauer to nine years, and Robinson to 2-1/4 years.","Steven Metro, 40, a law clerk at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, and Morgan Stanley stockbroker Vladimir Eydelman, 42, charged with insider trading .

On Friday night, authorities responded to a report that the child was not breathing at the couple's home in Frederick, Maryland and she was later pronounced dead in hospital. Frankie Williams, 24, told authorities he punched his daughter repeatedly while his wife was at work, according to investigators, and when his wife returned home, she did not call for help for six hours.

When she told her husband she needed to call . the doctor, 'he said no because child protective services would get . involved,' according to court documents, NBC Washington reported. A day after her death, her father was charged with child abuse resulting in death and other offenses after the little girl was allegedly found to have marks and bruises across her body. He 'stated he punched the victim hard, and his description of hard was hard enough to hurt an adult', according to court documents. He also allegedly admitted to assaulting the child in 2012, leaving her with a fractured skull and rib, and admitted to beating their other daughter, who is five months old. 'Cruel': The couple had just regained custody of their daughter following earlier claims they had abused her . Despite his alleged confession, his 21-year-old wife defended her husband as she spoke to WHAG the day after his arrest. 'Whatever was going through his mind I know he wasn't in his right mind when he was doing these things,' Stephanie Williams said. On Monday, she was charged with child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury. It comes just weeks after the child was returned to her parents, whose other child is in foster care. State's Attorney Charlie Smith told NBC that authorities had suspected the parents had beat Anayah after she was born in 2012 - leaving her with cerebral palsy - but could not prove it. Smith said doctors were 'convinced that it was no accident, but we couldn't pin it on anybody'.

Two thirds of voters want George Osborne to increase the amount people earn before paying tax, instead of a tax cut for middle and high earners, a new poll shows. Only 13 per cent of people think the Chancellor should use tomorrow’s Budget to increase the point at which workers start paying the 40p higher rate of tax. It will bolster Mr Osborne’s determination to face down calls from Tory MPs to take action to help the 1.3million extra people dragged into the 40p band. Two thirds of people back a rise in the income tax threshold over increase in the 40p rate . Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use tomorrow's Budget to increase the income tax threshold to £10,500 . The coalition parties have become bitterly divided over how to use extra cash in the Treasury coffers to cut income tax. The Lib Dems have pushed for an increase in the amount workers can earn before paying any income tax. In April it will hit £10,000 – up from £6,475 in 2010 – but Mr Osborne is expected to go further and increase it to £10,500. It will mean basic rate taxpayers will pay £800 less income tax in 2015 than in 2010. However, Mr Osborne has faced a storm of criticism from some Conservatives for freezing and lowering the higher rate of tax. In 2010 when the coalition was formed there were 3.02million people earning more than the £43,875 threshold where they started paying the higher tax rate. But this year the threshold has fallen to £41,450, which means 4.4million now pay the 40p rate.  In 1988 just 1.35million was paying that rate. According to a YouGov poll for the Sun, 66 per cent of people want Mr Osborne to use any money available for income tax cuts to increase the personal allowance. Only 13 per cent favour an increase in the 40p tax threshold, 10 per cent want neither change and 11 per cent don’t know. In a further boost for Mr Osborne, 33 per cent of people now think he is doing a ¿good job¿ as Chancellor, up from 26 per cent in December . Mr Osborne has extended his lead of Ed Balls for being the best Chancellor to 13 points, the YouGov survey for The Sun found . There has been clamour from Conservative backbenchers, backed by former chancellors Lord Lawson and Lord Lamont, for Mr Osborne to announce a significant hike in the threshold to ensure the higher rate is once again reserved for the biggest earners. But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted even those paying the 40p rate are better off as a result of increases to the tax threshold to £10,000. He told Sky News: ""There's a huge misconception about this. Yes, it is true that more people are paying the 40p rate of income tax, but no, they are not paying more income tax. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted even those paying the 40p rate of tax were better off . ‘It might sound counter-intuitive, but because we've raised the point at which you start paying income tax, finally reaching my long-cherished aim of removing income tax paid on the first £10,000 you earn as of next month, you are also better off as a 40 per cent income tax payer. ‘Far from paying any extra income tax as a 40 per cent income tax payer, you are on average about £300 better off. ‘In other words, you pay £300 less income tax than you might have done at the beginning of this Parliament.’ Asked if there would be any change in the 40p rate tomorrow, Mr Clegg . In a further boost for Mr Osborne, 33 per cent of people now think he is doing a ‘good job’ as Chancellor, up from 26 per cent in December. Some 39 per cent think he is doing a bad job, down from 46 per cent at the end of 2013. The Tory Chancellor has also extended his lead over Labour rival Ed Balls. In the latest YouGov poll 35 per cent said Mr Osborne would make the better Chancellor, compared to 22 per cent who said Mr Balls – a 13 point lead. In January last year, only 32 per cent said Mr Osborne, to Mr Balls’ 23 per cent, a 9 point lead.","Poll shows voters favour increase in the income tax threshold .

But it proved exactly the opposite when one of the pranksters was punched in the face by a passing bystander. The stunt, the latest from Jackass-style group Reckless Youth, involves a mock-mugging at an ATM. One member withdraws cash before being approached by another, balaclava-clad member who demands the money. A third member hides and films the fake robbery, and the reaction of bystanders. It was supposed to bring the Sydney-based group â€“ made up of Daniel Maran,19, and Robert Milazzo and George Proestos, both 16 â€“ online fame and notoriety. But it all went horribly wrong when one bystander, who thought he was witnessing a genuine robbery, punched Proestos in the face. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Three men attempted to stop what they believed was a robbery, only to learn afterwards that it was supposed to be a joke . The attack left the prankster covered in blood and nursing a suspected broken nose. The group uploaded the entire video, which also features several other fake thefts at Sydney ATMs, to YouTube, commenting that the purpose of the video was to see who would intervene to stop a robbery if they saw it happen right front of them. The group warned fans they got 'mixed results'. The clip has since gone viral, wracking up more than 450,000 views on YouTube. In the video's first three 'robberies', things run to plan with bystanders rushing to help Maran, who has been brought to the ground by his friend. The boys then confess the prank and nobody is hurt. One bystander who comes to help even calls out to other people to call the police before being told it was a joke. But the boys' luck soon runs out, and the last prank does not go quite as hoped. Three men can be seen trying to help Maran after Proestos pretends to rob him. A third man witnesses the scuffle, runs over and punches Proestos in the face. At that point one of the boys screams: 'It's a prank, it's a prank,' to stop the men. Proestos then screams in pain, as other passers-by run to the scene. WARNING GRAPHIC VIDEO CONTENT . Proestos can be seen running at Maran at the start of the intended stunt. The group said they were shocked at how willing the public was to intervene . Takedown: The shocked man is dragged back towards the floor before he has time to realise what is happening . Good Samaritans: Within seconds men are running towards the scene to help the victim . Not impressed by the stunt, one of the men who intervened can be heard saying in the video: 'It's not funny', followed by a 'Sorry dude'. Proestos rises from the ground and his injury is instantly clear as blood pours from his nose. He is then seen nursing his nose as blood continues to pour on the floor. With a swollen face and gash clearly visible on the left side of his nose, Proestos asks 'Is it healing up? Is it bad, bro?'. Maran said the punch broke his friend's nose, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. He also said the reaction online to the stunt was not what was expected.

The reaction from bystanders was also unexpected, with Maran saying he anticipated nobody would be injured in the prank and nor did he expect people to get involved the way they did by trying to stop the 'robbery', thus demonstrating the purpose of the video. One bystander, 35-year-old Mahendra Singh rushed to help in what he thought was a real robbery. Mr Singh said it was his natural reaction to help and he could not see what was funny about the stunt. 'The first thing I felt was very angry, and I just felt it was a very silly prank. I was worried that this person could have been hurt or I could have been hurt. I was just furious and I just walked off.' A NSW Police spokeswoman advised people not to take part in any activity that could cause harm to themselves or others. 'Such activities can be highly dangerous and easily misconstrued by members of the public. In some cases, participation may also constitute a criminal offence,' the spokeswoman said. The backlash hasn't stopped the three boys from creating new videos. Already a new clip of a fake fight has been uploaded to their YouTube channel. While not everyone may agree with the group's antics, they appear to be working, with more than 2000 subscribers to its YouTube channel and Facebook fan page.","Sydney trio filmed several fake 'robbery' pranks on passersby to 'test bystander reaction'

A transgender woman accused of shooting dead three prostitutes in 1990 has blamed the killings on her violent male persona. Donna Perry, 62, appeared in court in Spokane, Washington on Tuesday - 24 years after she allegedly murdered the women and dumped their bodies on the banks of the Spokane River. When Perry was arrested in connection with the crimes in 2012, she claimed that she had transitioned into a female in 2000 to stop her male persona - Doug Perry - from being violent. 'Douglas didn't stop, . Donna stopped it,' Perry told police about the killings, according to an affidavit filed in January. 'I'm not going to admit I killed anybody, I didn't. Donna has killed nobody.' When asked if Doug was responsible, she responded: 'I don't know if . Doug did or not, it was 20 years ago and I have no idea whether he did . or did not,' according to ABC News. In claims that experts say will only fuel misunderstandings about transgender people, Perry claimed she had the sex-change operation in Thailand - which involves removing the testicles and therefore affecting testosterone production - 'as a . permanent way to control violence'. She claimed when a person transitions from male to female, 'there's a great downturn in violence' - which experts deny. She is accused of killing Yolanda .

According to the affidavit, detectives also interviewed a woman who had shared a cell with Perry during a stint in an Oregon prison in 1998. She claimed that Perry said she had killed nine prostitutes 'because she couldn't breed and the women had the ability to have children and they were wasting it being ""pond scum"".'

'For some people, it's a metaphor: ""I was a different person before I came out"",' said Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York City psychiatrist. 'It's a certain way that they use the metaphor when transitioning for those who were very unhappy before and now are happy. But it's different when a person makes a claim that somehow they have no linkage to the person they used to be - that would be more of a disturbed presentation.' Experts also say there is no evidence that hormone therapy in gender treatments helps reduce aggression or violence.

Mystery: The case was cold for more than two decades until Perry was linked to it through DNA evidence . Jack Halberstam, a transgender professor of American and gender studies at University of Southern California, said that Perry's publicized statements are a 'weak defense'. 'Even if we as a person are less aggressive once we resolved a gender disorder, it does not absolve the responsibility of killing three women,' he said. 'As a legal defense, putting away the science, it's absolute nonsense.' He added: 'Making being transgender into a motivating factor for murder is almost like the horror film, ""Dressed to Kill"".

A pub owner has riled gun enthusiasts by putting up a sign in his window banning firearms from the establishment and calling those who carry them 'losers'. The owner of the Backstreets Pub and Deli in Clemson, South Carolina, put up his potentially provocative handmade sign around St Patrick's Day. The full notice read: 'No concealed weapons allowed. 'If you are such a loser that you feel a need to carry a gun with you when you go out, I do not want your business. D****bag.' A South Carolina bar owner put this sign up in his bar - causing outrage among gun advocates . The sign was photographed by one upset drinker who uploaded it online - and it subsequently went viral. Previously, the bar and restaurant averaged three out of five stars on Yelp. It also had mainly positive reviews on its Facebook page. But after the sign was spotted by gun advocates online, that rating has nosedived. Now the bar has over 300 reviews - it previously only had three - by people who allegedly found the pub had 'bad service' and was 'overpriced'. One of the users even posted on the pub's Facebook page claiming she: 'Threw my guts up for three days straight after eating the wings.' Another user, Bill Mallett, said: 'Not very good food... very bad service.. the kind of place you see on those restaurant fix it shows. Would not recommend. Danny Graham added: 'Get one star because it's not letting me put zero. Didn't like the bar and didn't like the sign up dogging concealed carriers and calling us D****bags.

If you feel the need to bring a gun into a college bar you are a douche bag. 'And if you're drinking than you are violating the law.' Perhaps fueling the fire, the man later wrote he himself is a gun owner who did not like 'irrational...gun nuts'. He then posted pictures of more permanent-looking signs - which were yet again blasted by users. Last month, South Carolina passed a law which allows licensed pistol owners to take concealed weapons into pubs and bars - as long as they don't drink while inside.

The Federal Bureau of Investigations must offer a federal judge a better explanation as to why it is refusing to give information to a graduate student researching an alleged plot to kill 'Occupy' leaders in Texas, the judge hearing the case ruled last week. Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the U.S. District Court for the District of . Columbia wrote in her ruling that the reason the FBI gave for denying Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate student Ryan Noah Shapiro access to key pieces of information in heavily redacted documents was not sufficient, and a better explanation must be provided if the Bureau continues to refuse to share the information. Shapiro is researching an alleged sniper plot to kill leaders of a Houston-based spin-off of the 'Occupy' movement. He sued the FBI after submitting a Freedom of Information Act request with the Bureau and getting back the heavily redacted documents. FOIA: Ryan Shapiro says the FBI is violating the Freedom of Information Act by withholding certain information he requested . The FBI claims the information Shapiro is asking for is exempt under FOIA. Shapiro disagrees, and feels the FBI is violating FOIA regulations. The plot to kill 'Occupy' leaders first was discovered in documents released to a civil rights organization in Washington D.C. as part of a separate FOIA request. The documents released by the FBI referenced a 'plan to kill the leadership via suppressed sniper rifles. It's unclear who was behind this alleged plot, and whether it was ever investigated by the FBI. The FBI is granted certain leeway under FOIA - it is allowed to withhold 'information compiled for law enforcement purposes' if disclosing it would interfere with ongoing investigations or endanger lives. Not impressed: Judge Rosemary Collyer says the FBI needs to provide more information about why it is refusing to hand over the information . According to the Washington Post, the exemption 'was repeatedly cited by FBI FOIA chief David Hardy in a filing to the . court in support of an FBI motion to dismiss Mr. Shapiro’s lawsuit. Some . information was redacted, according to Mr. Hardy’s filing, because it . involved information shared with local law enforcement agencies related . to an investigation of “potential criminal activity by protestors . involved with the Occupy movement in Houston.'” Possible crimes cited by Hardy include 'domestic terrorism' and 'advocating overthrow of the government.' That vague explanation was not enough for Judge Collyer. Occupy: The information is in regard to an alleged plot to assassinate leaders of an Occupy movement in Houston . 'At no point does Mr. Hardy supply specific facts as to the basis for . FBI’s belief that the Occupy protestors might have been engaged in . terroristic or other criminal activity,' she wrote in her ruling. 'Neither the word . ‘terrorism’ nor the phrase ""advocating the overthrow of the government"" are talismanic, especially where FBI purports to be investigating . individuals who ostensibly are engaged in protected First Amendment . activity.' Judge Collyer has given the FBI until April 9 to provide a more satisfactory explanation of its withholding of the information by April 9. Collyer is allowing the agency to file its response under seal.","The alleged plot was first disclosed in documents released by the FBI in response to a FOIA request by a civil rights organization .

"Time to deliver for Tiger Woods, Lee Westwood, Phil Mickelson, Sergio Garcia and Ian Poulter . Miguel Angel Jimenez targets Ryder Cup place . This could be comeback year for the newly engaged Rory McIlroy . By . Derek Lawrenson . PUBLISHED: . 17:40 EST, 6 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:04 EST, 6 January 2014 . For five elite golfers, this year looks particularly laden with significance. All five have reached a crossroads in their glorious careers.  What lies ahead is a season where dreams will be realised or doubts will really start to surface as to whether they will reach the summit of their ambition. Five reasons, then, why this will be another compelling year for intrigue. Straight and narrow: Tiger Woods hits a ball across the Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul, Turkey . Tiger Woods . Being generous, you could give him a free pass over the fact that he was never a contender at last year's majors. They didn't set up well for him - and he did win five other tournaments to reclaim his position as the best player in the world. This year, three of the majors are at courses where he has won in the past and the US Open takes place at Pinehurst, where he finished second in 2005. If he doesn't win this year, he will fall off the pace regarding Jack Nicklaus's all-time record haul of 18 majors for the first time. In other words, no majors this year and catching Nicklaus will recede into the realms of the outlandish. Lee Westwood . Never mind winning that elusive first major. Right now he faces a heck of a fight simply to make Europe's Ryder Cup team. The clear back-marker among the serious contenders for Gleneagles in September, the 40-year-old has slipped to 25th in the world and hasn't won a tournament for 18 months. Another season like last year and the Englishman will be struggling to stay in the top 50. A year like no other coming up, then. Let's hope it brings the best out of him. Right time: Phil Mickelson has chance to complete the career Grand Slam . Slippery slope: Lee Westwood must rediscover his form and fast . Phil Mickelson . IN 1999, the US Open was at Pinehurst and Mickelson finished second - then became a father for the first time the following day. This time, he will celebrate his 44th birthday on the day following the event in mid-June. The storied North Carolina venue could have been built with Mickelson's game in mind. And so, if he is ever to complete the career Grand Slam and win his first national title after no fewer than six runner-up finishes, it has to be this year. Sergio Garcia . The previous year ended not only in a victory in Thailand for the Spaniard but also saw him the most content he has been in ages in the arms of his new love. A big ask, we know, but can the sweet senorita who carried his clubs that week also carry off the part of psychologist and keep the moody, mercurial one in a happy place during the four majors? Born in the same year as Adam Scott and Justin Rose, this has the feel of a now-or-never year if he is to follow their recent examples. Focused: Ian Poulter believes he can win his first major this year . Happy days: It could be now or never for Sergio Garcia . Ian Poulter . The popular Englishman will celebrate his 38th birthday later this week and do so at the top of the Ryder Cup qualifying charts after his marvellous finish to last year, but he's still smarting over his failure to muster a victory in 2013. Poulter truly believes he can put that right and then some this year and win his first major - and you can see where he is coming from. The stars may never be more  perfectly aligned for him than they are in 2014. 'The world's most interesting golfer' is the accolade that a leading American website paid last week to the colourful Spaniard, Miguel Angel Jimenez. He's certainly among the most remarkable. Who gave him a prayer at his time of life of recovering fully from a serious skiing accident this time last year? Yet here he is, celebrating his 50th birthday at the European Tour's calendar year opener in South Africa this week by targeting a Ryder Cup place - and why not, having won as recently as last month in Hong Kong? He's living proof that a man who can putt will give any golfing gym rat a run for his money. Content: Rory McIlroy watches Caroline Wozniacki practice in Sydney, Australia . Rory silences sirens in his head . Three months ago, we talked about the siren voices in Rory McIlroy's head that were preventing him from playing properly. Since then, he's set about quietening them one by one. Resolving a court case with Oakley? Check. Sorting out some swing issues and restoring confidence? Check. Feeling content away from the course and shutting up those malicious Irish newspaper gossip  columnists once and for all? Check. I've written before about my belief that this will be the year of the comeback for the newly engaged McIlroy. It is one that we should all eagerly anticipate. Quote of the week . 'I mean, it's just like anyone else's grandad. Just he played golf for a living.'  Nick O'Leary, one of the stars of the Florida State Seminoles college football team, gets asked about his relative.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 14:12 EST, 19 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:54 EST, 19 March 2014 . A University of California at Irvine study shows that titanium-coated golf clubs can cause fires in course-side vegetation . Golfers are urged to swing with care after scientists proved that titanium-coated clubs can cause course-side vegetation to burst into flames. Scientists at the University of California, Irvine, proved that titanium-coated clubs can cause sparks that ignite vegetation. Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Steve Concialdi said Wednesday that the results confirm a suspicion investigators have had for years - that titanium alloy clubs were the cause of at least two blazes on area golf courses. One blaze burned 25 acres at Irvine's Shady Canyon in 2010. A second fire, sparked at Arroyo Trabuco Golf Club in Mission Viejo, burned close to homes. 'The common denominator was each golfer used a titanium club, and hit the ball just out of bounds next to dry vegetation where the ground was extremely rocky,' Concialdi said. Scientists painstakingly re-created in the lab course the conditions on the days of the fires. Using high-speed cameras and electron microscopes, they found that if hit upon a rock, clubs containing titanium can produce sparks of up to 3,000 degrees that will burn for more than a second, said James Earthman, a chemical engineering and materials science professor and an author of the study. 'And that gives the spark plenty of time' to ignite nearby foliage, he said. 'Titanium reacts violently with both oxygen and nitrogen in the air.' In contrast, when standard stainless steel clubs were used, there was no reaction. Most golf clubs have steel heads but many manufacturers also make ones with a titanium alloy component in the head. Such alloys are 40 per cent lighter, which can make the club easier to swing, researchers said. Concialdi said the Fire Authority is giving golfers using titanium clubs permission to break the rules and 'improve their lie' - that is, to move their ball away from rocks and dry vegetation. 'If they need to take a penalty, take a penalty,' he said. One blaze burned 25 acres at Irvine's Shady Canyon in 2010.

A father and his 15-year-old son who died while cave diving on Christmas Day had run out of air while descending to dangerous depths, investigators have said. The bodies of Daren Spivey, 35, and his son Dillon Sanchez were found hours after they went diving at the Eagle Nest Sink cave in Hernando County, Florida last December. A sheriff's office investigation has found that pair died accidentally after apparently losing track of time and diving to 233 feet while using just air in their tanks. Tragic: Darrin Spivey, 35, and his 15-year-old son Dillon Sanchez were found dead following a cave dive last December after they lost track of time and ran out of air, authorities concluded . The depth meant that the duo - who were not certified in cave diving - . should have used a trimix combination for their breathing instead of . just air, rescue diver Eric Deister told the Tampa Tribune. He added that they shouldn't have gone deeper than 218 feet due . to possible toxic effects. Rescuers found Spivey's body floating 120 feet below the surface with his breathing device out of his mouth - an indication that he had perhaps tried to give his son air after the teenager ran out. Rescue divers added in the report that they believe the boy then panicked and attempted to swim to the . surface because he did not have his mouthpiece intact and his mask was . around his neck. Unprepared: The duo, who were trying out new equipment, were not certified to dive in caves . The teenager's body was found 67 feet below the surface. Divers found the duo's tanks had run out of air and their light sources had run out of battery. The father and son had left home at 7am to test out new diving equipment at Buford Spring, but found that it was flooded so headed to Eagles Nest Sink, arriving at around 11am. Spivey's fiancee Holly King started to worry when the two didn't return . and she couldn't get through to Spivey on his cell phone. She called law enforcement around 3pm.

Divers concluded that the men had the proper equipment to dive, but they did not have the experience. Spivey only had a certification for open water diving, and his son had no certification. Eagle Nest Sink does not check diver certifications. On the approach to Eagles Nest Sink, there are warning signs that tell just how dangerous the diving there is. Diving site Aquaviews.net has named the Floirida cave as 'one of the top three extreme dives in the world'. Warning: There are signs at the cave warning people against diving unless they are certified . 'Only . for highly experienced cave divers and the technically sound, the . descent of Eagle's nest is similar to that of a chimney and hundreds of . feet below it opens up into a large cavern called ""the Main Ballroom"", . beyond which are longer tunnels and crannies that go even deeper,' the . website said.

Chris Christie took on a persistent health care activist Tuesday during a regularly scheduled town hall event in South River, New Jersey, fending off accusations for nearly four minutes. Maura Collinsgru, a health policy advocate with the liberal group New Jersey Citizen Action, blasted Christie during the question-and-answer event, the 114th such town hall he has held since taking office. She blamed him for meeting her fellow activists with 'silence' when they try to help poor New Jerseyans access Medicaid benefits. 'Let me ask you this: When I expanded the Medicaid program, is that silence?' retorted an annoyed Christie. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took questions during a Town Hall meeting on Tuesday, including one stemwinder from a pro-Obamacare activist . Maura Collinsgru of New Jersey Citizen Action accused Gov. Chris Christie of failing to spend enough Medicaid dollars to provide health care to 900,000 New Jerseyans . Occupy Town Hall? Additional protesters jumped up to chant anti-Christie messages about Hurricane Sandy relief. They were later identified as activists with Working Families, a group supported by public-sector labor unions. The New Jersey chief executive was among a small group of Republican governors who opted to take federal dollars provided by the Obamacare law to raise the maximum income that qualifies for free Medicaid insurance coverage. The billions of dollars are helping lower-income New Jerseyans access health care now, but in future years the financial burden will shift to the states – a reality behind most Republican governors' decisions to turn down the money from Washington. Christie has forged a middle path, taking the Medicaid dollars but refusing to spend still more state taxpayer money to expand Medicaid access even further, as many Democratic governors have done. He told Collingsru on Tuesday that his state is spending more federal and state dollars on Medicaid that it was when he became governor. 'We've expanded Medicaid,' he countered. 'We're the second most generous Medicaid program in the United States of America.' 'You're simply wrong,' Christie blasted, in the tense exchange broadcast on CNN. And he won't, he said, spend more on a 'failed federal program.' Christie stayed silent as police removed his union-backed hecklers, including the woman at far left above. Christie has held 114 Town Hall constituent meetings since becoming governor, earning a reputation for responsiveness despite occasionally being raked over the coals on subjects like Hurricane Sandy relief and the so-called 'Bridgegate' scandal . 'You believe Obamacare works, and I do not,' Christie said, becoming more agitated by the minute but earning sustained applause from his audience. 'I'm sorry. That's just the way it goes.' 'We need to do other things,' the woman insisted, sounding more like a heckler than a questioner and insisting Medicaid is 'not a cure-all.' She was likely referring to the New Jersey government's decision to opt out of creating its own Obamacare insurance exchange, forcing residents to use the federal government's problem-plagued healthcare.gov website instead. Christie was also interrupted by more than a dozen union-backed activists from the Working Families organization. They sounded more like Occupy Wall Street devotees, shouting 'Mic check!' before chanting slogans in a call-and-response fashion. 'We are here to demand that you stop your corrupt uses of Hurricane Sandy money,' they yelled. 'There are still families without homes who have received no aid.' Police ushered them out as the mostly appreciative crowd applauded. Christie, who had kept mum while the protesteres yelled, said, 'Well, congratulations. You have now seen the latest gift given to you by the public sector unions in the state of New Jersey.'","The New Jersey governor fended off rhetorical body blows for nearly four minutes as a pro-Obamacare activist jabbed him about Medicaid access .

OkCupid bills itself as 'the best free dating site on Earth' and so Michael Picciano was not wary when he received a message from 'genuineguy62' The New Yorker was excited when on February 11, 2013 he received a message from ‘genuineguy62’. Picciano said that he ‘felt safe’ and ‘trusted’ his online match, supposedly a man named Bruce Thompson, simply because ‘Thompson’ had a profile on OkCupid, which bills itself as ‘the best free dating site on Earth’, reports the New York Post. The following month, Picciano and ‘Thompson’ were in contact via phone, Skype and email. ‘Thompson’ said that since ‘they had found each other’ there was no need for them to continue on the site and they should delete their accounts – Picciano agreed. Picciano was ‘comfortable’ enough with his new love to send him $24,000 ‘for unexpected fees he incurred in his dealings setting up a new computer-parts business’. He was not suspicious when ‘Thompson’ asked for the money to be sent to ‘Dennis E. Racer’ in Addison, Texas, and ‘Edmond Thebeau’ in Canada.

Two Providence College basketball players have been accused of sexually assaulting another student on campus. An 18-year-old woman claimed she was assaulted by freshman players Rodney Bullock and Brandon Austin on November 2 and into the early hours of November 3, according to reports. The student, who knew the players, reported the incident to police on March 6. They are now investigating. However, Bullock's lawyer claims the college conducted an internal investigation when the incident first came to light in November, and cleared the men of the allegations. Accused: Brandon Austin (pictured) also allegedly assaulted a fellow student . The players were initially . suspended on November 6, shortly before the season began, on the day a complaint about the incident was lodged. They were suspended for 'not upholding their responsibilities as . student-athletes', according to the school. The school announced in December that Bullock and Austin would not be allowed to play for the entire season. Providence spokesman Steve Maurano refused to give details about the initial complaint, but said he would 'recommend . against drawing any conclusions that our (on-campus) process ended with a . finding that our student-athlete was found responsible for sexual . assault'. Bullock's lawyer, Bill Lynch, said a school investigation cleared the players of sexual assault. 'The school did an exhaustive review, interviewed all the parties including the two male students, who voluntarily participated in the process,' he said. 'There was never a finding against either of the students that there was a sexual assault.' Scene: Police are investigating an allegation that two Providence College (pictured) basketball players sexually assaulted another student on the campus grounds . Austin has since transferred to the University of Oregon. An Oregon spokesman did not immediately comment but said coach Dana Altman would be willing to address the issue at his scheduled news conference as the team prepares for its first NCAA tournament game in Milwaukee. The spokesman, Andy McNamara, said he didn't know if Austin had a lawyer. Providence is also playing in the NCAA tournament after winning the Big East Tournament for the first time in 20 years. The 11th seed Friars flew Wednesday morning to San Antonio, where they're scheduled to play North Carolina on Friday. Lynch questioned the timing of the allegations. 'Suddenly, a week before Providence is playing on the NCAA tournament, there's a complaint filed? I'm getting too old to believe in coincidences,' he said. He said his client had not yet been contacted by the police. If he is, Lynch said, 'he will do exactly as he did at the review at the school and participate 100 percent voluntarily'.","Rodney Bullock and Brandon Austin accused of sexually assaulting 18-year-old student in November .

A group of teenagers who allegedly broke into a Los Angeles mansion to host a party that caused more than $1 million in damage have been charged. The teenagers, aged between 15 and 18, are accused of breaking into the luxury La Habra Heights house while the owner, Nick Radoi, was away in November last year. More than 100 teenagers turned up for the party at the $7 million mansion, after it was advertized on social media sites including Twitter. Loot: A $250,000 stuffed snow leopard and armor were among items recovered after the party . Party: Charges have been brought against 14 teenage revelers accused of breaking into this Los Angeles mansion . The party started in the yard but the house was later broken into a number of valuable items, including medieval armor, designer suits and a stuffed snow leopard valued at $250,000, were taken. The 12 boys and two girls who are facing charges related to the party and damage have not been named. Damage: Romanian businessman Nick Radoi was away when a party was held in his $7 million home . According to investigators, revelers broke in through a window and caused about $1 million of damage inside the 90,000sq ft property. Furniture was broken and dozens of luxury items were taken, though police said much of it was later recovered. 'This is one of the most serious juvenile and adult crimes that we have come across,' Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said when the teenagers were first arrested in December last year. At the time of the party the house-owner, who made his fortune through a trucking company, was in Europe. The house was also being offered for sale at the time of the party and subsequent vandalism. Neighbors had reported seeing cars parked on the road leading up to the property, and heard noise but because the homeowner often held parties himself, they thought little of it. The teenagers suspected of causing the damage were caught after allegedly posting pictures online of them damaging the house and posing with the stolen goods. Detectives said they also found pictures allegedly showing teenagers damaging a 16ft window overlooking the pool, which was one of the most valuable features in the house, . 'There's like an underground grotto, which had like a 16ft window looking into the pool. Somebody actually broke that window and shattered it, and we're amazed that no kid got killed,' Captain Timothy Murakami, of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, told ABC 7 shortly after the party. Theft: The teenagers face burglary charges after valuable items were taken from the property . Luxury: Designer suits, above, and other items were wrecked or taken during the party, police say . Lieutenant Arthur Scott told KTLA last year: 'They just had a free-for-all once the place was broken into. Once entry was made, it was like, ""Oh, this is fun"".' Each of the 14 teenagers face one count of misdemeanor trespassing, and nine face one count of felony burglary, which has a maximum six-year prison sentence. Other charges include theft and receiving stolen property. The teenagers, who live in and around La Habra-Whittier are due to appear at juvenile court on Wednesday.","Burglary and trespass charges made against 12 boys and 2 girls .

Justin DeRyke pleaded guilty to the murder of Willow Long, his 7-year-old niece, after initially telling police that he had 'put her out of her misery' after she fell and pierced her neck . A southern Illinois man pleaded guilty on Tuesday to the first-degree murder of his seven-year-old niece. In September 2013, Justin DeRyke was accused of killing Willow Long near her home in Watson, about 100 miles northeast of St Louis. He claimed that she had fallen and pierced her neck on a brush stick so he cut her throat and then stabbed her in the heart to ‘put her out of her misery’. DeRyke was babysitting Willow and her 3-year-old brother while the children’s mother was in a bar and their grandparents at work. The 22-year-old caretaker said that he had spent the evening playing video games until 10.30pm when he went to his room to watch a porn video. Half an hour later, Willow went up to him and grabbed his hand to persuade him to watch a film. As she did so, she accidentally scratched him and he lost his temper. He yelled at her, he claimed, and she ran out of the house slipping and falling onto a pile of sharp brush sticks, one of which stabbed her in the neck. DeRyke told police that the girl was twitching and he did not want her to suffer, so he grabbed a knife from his room, slit the child’s throat and then stabbed her in the heart about five times to 'put her out of her misery'.

He played video games, watched a porn film and then murdered the girl . Victim: Seven-year-old Willow Long was murdered by her uncle after he had watched a porn video . According to court documents, DeRyke wrapped Willow’s body in several plastic bags secured with duct tape, and then disposed of her in the countryside south of Watson. Ciara DeRyke reported her daughter missing on the Sunday and around 1,000 volunteers searched for her, finding the remains the next day. Justin DeRyke went to work instead of helping with the search, raising police suspicions. Vigil: The town's people left tributes after the remains of Willow were found two days after she was murdered by her uncle . A post-mortem examination showed that besides the injuries to her throat, collarbone and chest, Willow also suffered defensive wounds to her hands, suggesting that she had fought for her life. Judge Kimberly Koester accepted DeRyke's guilty plea. As part of the plea deal, other charges against DeRyke were dismissed. ‘Justin DeRyke's plea of guilty to the offence of first-degree murder means that society will be protected and the murderer will spend the rest of his life behind bars,’ said Effingham County State's Attorney Bryan M. Kibler. ‘The sentence in this case is the maximum allowed by law. Justin DeRyke will never again pose a threat to any child.’ Willow Long's remains were wrapped in several plastic bags secured with duct tape and then dumped in the local countryside . Ciara DeRyke was charged with obstruction for lying to police investigating the girl's disappearance. She told them she had seen her daughter when the girl was already dead. She pleaded guilty in January and was sentenced to 120 days’ jail. She also received 18 months’ probation. The Illinois Department of Children and Family Service have taken Willow’s 3-year-old brother into protective custody.","Justin DeRyke, 22, was babysitting niece and her three-year-old brother while mother went out drinking .

After a four-year investigation into Toyota's disclosure of safety problems, the U.S. reached a $1.2 billion settlement with the Japanese automaker, according to a person close to the investigation. According to the source, Attorney General Eric Holder, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, were announcing the settlement Wednesday morning. The investigation focused on whether Toyota Motor Corp. was forthright in reporting problems related to unintended acceleration issues. In this November 2010, a Toyota Camry is shown after it crashed on Utah highway. Police suspect problems with the Camry's accelerator or floor mat caused the crash that left two people dead and two others injured . In a statement early on Wednesday, Toyota . said it has 'cooperated with the U.S. Attorney's office in this matter . for more than four years' and had 'made fundamental changes to become a . more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed . to continued improvements.' From 2010 to 2012, Toyota Motor Corp. paid fines of more than $66 million for delays in reporting unintended acceleration issues. In 2009, Toyota issued massive recalls in . the U.S. totaling more than 10 million vehicles for various issues . including faulty brakes, gas pedal and floor mats. Last . year, Toyota agreed to pay more than $1 billion to resolve hundreds of . lawsuits claiming owners suffered economic losses due to the recalls.

A plan to boost herds of bighorn sheep in southern Arizona has been mired in controversy after half of the animals that were relocated were devoured by mountain lions. Wildlife officials spent $150,000 taking 31 of the protected species to the Catalina Mountains, near Tucson, only for 15 of them to be eaten by predators within a few months of arriving. Now animal rights activists are calling for the conservation project to be scrapped, arguing that it cruelly exposes the sheep to unnecessary risk. Big horns: Wildlife officials spent $150,000 taking 31 of the protected species to the Catalina Mountains, near Tucson, only for 15 of them to be eaten by predators within a few months of arriving . And they have slammed plans to shoot mountain lions in transplant areas before bringing in the bighorns, saying that the big cats should not be punished for following their natural predatory instincts. Bighorn sheep once flourished across the western U.S. until a precipitous decline in their population over the past century. There are now an estimated 6,000 bighorns in the whole of Arizona. In an effort to rebuild a herd which disappeared from the Catalinas in the Nineties, Arizona's Game and Fish Department in November began a three-year plan to transplant bighorns from Yuma to the mountain range near Tucson. Hungry: Animal rights activists have slammed plans to shoot mountain lions in transplant areas before bringing in the bighorns to cut down on deaths . In the first phase of the $600,000 project, wildlife officials spent $150,000 on catching 31 sheep, fitting them with GPS tracking collars and flying them by helicopter to their new home. But just four months later, 15 of the animals had been caught, killed and eaten by mountain lions, Fox News reports. Now officials are planning to cull the big cats before executing the next stage of their conservation plan, even after the shooting of two in the aftermath of the bighorn feeding frenzy sparked protests. Jim Paxon of Arizona's Game and Fish Department told Fox News that 'in hindsight, we should have taken out some mountain lions.' 'Conservation of wildlife is never easy, never quick and is often what biology professors call messy,' he said, adding that officials are not planning a 'wholesale removal of mountain lions' from the Catalinas. 'All we’re doing is removing mountain lions that prey on bighorn sheep in the best habitat area for those sheep,' he said. The Catalinas: The plan is intended to rebuild a herd which disappeared from the Tucson range in the Nineties . Critics say that Arizona's bighorn conservation plan was badly planned from the start and should be stopped immediately. Ricardo Small of the group Friends of Wild Animals called the planned mountain lion cull 'a mistake', claiming that less competition merely leads to more cubs and 'the result is more mountain lions than were there to begin with.' 'It's a waste of bighorn sheep and a waste of mountain lion,' he added.","Animal activists argue that the project cruelly exposes sheep to predators .

Conventional wisdom has us believe that those at the lower end of the intelligence spectrum are more unguarded and trusting, but this is apparently not the case. It is those with a higher IQ who are in fact likely to be more trusting of others according to new research. And being more trusting of others not only benefits society in general, but tends to make the individual happier and healthier, researchers at the University of Oxford found. Brainy people are more likely to trust other people, maybe because they are able to better discern who will betray them . Published in the journal, PLOS ONE, the study was based on an analysis of the General Social Survey, a nationally representative public opinion survey carried out in the United States every one to two years. They found that higher IQ was linked with a greater sense of trust in others and society and suggest that intelligence may include a higher ability to judge character. This would explain the findings as those with a higher IQ would be less likely to betray people who will betray them, and so develop a greater faith in others. Many  studies have linked trust with all manner of positive traits for the individual including entrepreneurship, volunteering, self-rated health, and happiness . Lead author Noah Carl said: ‘Intelligence is shown to be linked with trusting others, even after taking into account factors like marital status, education and income. This finding supports what other researchers have argued, namely that being a good judge of character is a distinct part of human intelligence which evolved through natural selection.’ Many previous studies have linked what is termed generalised trust – a sense of confidence and belief in society and the world around you- with all manner of positive traits for the individual including entrepreneurship, volunteering, self-rated health, and happiness. The researchers also found this link, but found that trust was beneficial for people regardless of their level of intelligence. It seems that developing faith in people is likely to help you feel and do better in life, even if you’re no Einstein.","Research from University of Oxford found link between IQ and trust .

The Bactrian camel is the rarer of the two camel species (the other being the dromedary) and is recognisable by its two humps - which store large amounts of fat anabling the camel to survive for long periods without water. Bactrians are pack animals and traditionally found in dry regions. There are around two million Bactrians - most of which are domesticated, with a population of just 800 believed to be living in the wild, mostly in remote regions of Mongolia and China, migrating to rivers in Siberia during winter. Bactrians are known for their tolerance for cold, drought, and high altitudes, and although they prefer a diet of plants, the highly adaptable animals will feed on anything they can find, including bones and sometimes even rope or tents. They also eat snow to provide them with water, but beer-drinking camels are not unusual with some racing animals given it (in moderation) to make them livelier. The Grants said he was in a sorry state upon arrival but, thanks to good living on grass, horse feed plus his weekend pint, he has shot up and is now thriving. 'He was much smaller when we got him and his humps were floppy,' said Mrs Grant. 'Now they are high and firm, which mean he's in great health.'

The pets will all move with the family when they downsize, although Tom, now 26, who is moving to his own home, has now outgrown his birthday present.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported a young woman called police saying her friend had just given birth and dumped the body. Jordan-Smith was a college student, home for the holidays, when she allegedly gave birth to a girl weighing 3lbs7oz. The Soldan International Studies High School graduate initially told police she didn't know she was . pregnant. The teen has been charged with abandonment of a corpse and could face up to four years in prison if convicted. Scene: Jordan-Smith allegedly dumped the baby's body in an alley behind her apartment building on the 4200 block of Red Bud Avenue (pictured) in St. Louis, Missouri, in November . The baby’s body was not claimed by Jordan-Smith's family. St. Louis police detectives arranged to have a funeral for the baby, whom they named Raguel after the angel of justice. About a dozen police officers and some members of Jordan-Smith's family gathered at a chapel in Calvary Cemetery in January to mourn the loss of little Raguel. The memorial was organized by Garden of Innocents, a group which provides memorial services and burials for unclaimed children and infants in the St. Louis region. 'Today is not about blame,' Tonya Tanksley, a child abuse detective, told the gathering. 'It’s about compassion and honoring the life of a little person.' It was Tanksley who came up with the child's name. 'She was a beautiful baby girl. She had a full head of hair and fingernails,' she said.","Lucretia Jordan-Smith, 18, has been charged with abandonment of a corpse .

An Illinois woman who became pregnant just six months after she underwent a tubal ligation in 2008 and gave birth to a baby girl with sickle cell disease is now suing her doctor for 'wrongful pregnancy.' While a small percentage of women become pregnant after getting their tubes tied, Cynthia Williams' situation was all the more shocking because she had just a single ovary and she believes the doctor may have cauterized the wrong falopian tube. Williams was further dismayed after she experienced congestive heart failure following the pregnancy she didn't believe could happen and now the 44-year-old mother wants money for  the 'extraordinary' medical expenses she says she'll incur as she raises Kennadi, who is now 4. 'I love Kennadi with all my heart...But it¿s been a life change for everybody': Cynthia Williams (right) is suing the doctor she says fouled up her tubal ligation, leading to her pregnancy with Kennadi (left), who is now 4 and living with sickle cell disease . Williams is suing Dr. Byron A. Rosner, MD of Reproductive Health Associates for 'wrongful pregnancy' and wants damages and money for her daughter's many medical expenses . 'I was livid,' Williams recelled to ABCnews.com about the moment her pregnancy test came back positive. 'I just lost it.' Williams had several reasons to be dismayed. She and her husband had decided to stop having babies after three because they both carry the genetic trait for sickle cell and had already had one child with the full blown disease. 'I just wanted to get my tubes tied,' Williams said. And she did just that with Dr. Byron Rosner of . Reproductive Health Associates in Hazel Crest. Except she only technically needed one tube tied. Williams had her right ovary removed at the age of 12 due to a cyst. Despite that, in 2010 Williams gave birth to her daughter Kennadi. Kennadi . had sickle cell disease, but Williams was unable to take care of her . because he suffered congestive heart failure . after the little girl's birth by c-section. Tubal ligation is a permanent procedure used to prevent pregnancy. The fallopian tubes are cauterized, cut and/or tie to prevent the sperm and the egg from meeting. While rare, pregnancy can occur after the procedure. Failure occurs in between 2-10 out of every 1,000 tubal ligations . 'This is . right after I have a baby that I still can’t believe I had,' she told . ABC. 'I couldn’t be with my baby because I was too sick.' Williams spent two weeks in intensive care and missed work for a total of nine months. She . filed suit against Dr. Byron Rosner in 2010. Last month an . appellate court ruled that the state could go forward despite a move to . dismiss by Rosner's attorney's. 'Having . a baby after a sterilization procedure is something that happens,' said . Williams’ attorney, Beverly Spearman. But then Spearman learned that Williams' only had one ovary and started to see the case differently. 'When I found out more about the . whole story, I said, ""OK, let’s move forward. Let’s see where this . goes.""' According to medical records obtained by ABC, Rosner 'tied,' 'excised' and 'cauterized' Williams' right falopian tube. However, her right ovary had been removed. 'She is the absolute love of my life, but it¿s hard': Cynthia and her husband both have the sickle cell genetic train, not the disease. which means each of their children was born with a 25 percent chance of having sickle cell disease. After one of their other children ( now ages 25, 21 and 17) was born with the painful illness, they decided to stop having children...then little Kennadi came along . The records reportedly indicate that her left tube was intact and 'normal in appearance.' Rosner's . attorney Todd Stalmck told ABC that his client 'complied with the . standard of care' in performing Williams' tubal ligation. But his former patient disagrees and now wants damages for 'personal injury to her, emotional distress, and for lost wages' and medical costs from Rosner. 'It’s . not fair,' Williams said. 'She is the absolute love of my life, but . it’s hard. Sometimes people think I’m her grandmother.' A normal red blood cell (right) and a sickle cell (left) SICKLE CELL DISEASE . Sickle cell disease demands immediate treatment for babies. About 80,000 Americans have sickle cell disease, in which oxygen-carrying hemoglobin clumps inside red blood cells, turning them into a sickle shape that can't squeeze through tiny blood vessels. That causes pain, infections and eventually life-threatening organ damage. SICKLE CELL TRAIT . Sickle cell trait is different. More than 2.5 million Americans have it, meaning they carry one copy of the abnormal hemoglobin gene, not the two needed to cause full disease. Babies from couples who both have the trait, like Cynthia and Kenneth, have a 25 percent chance of having sickle cell disease. Trait carriers only occasionally experience health problems, like blood in the urine, some blood clumping at high altitudes and in athletes — in which intense exercise can cause blood cells to sickle enough to block blood flow to muscles, which rapidly break down. Sickle cell is most common in black Americans — about 10% have the trait — and also in people of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Central and South American ancestry.

She recently admitted scaling back her fashion work to spend more time campaigning on green issues. But if anyone doubted Dame Vivienne Westwood’s eco-warrior credentials, the designer has made a rather startling confession. The 72-year-old has revealed that her commitment to the environment means she doesn’t take shower every day, and even shares dirty bathwater with her husband. Scroll down for video . Vivienne Westwood has admitted to not showering every day and even using her husband's bath water . Instead, Dame Vivienne said that she simply ‘washes her bits’ each morning before dashing out of the house. The star made the comments during a new campaign video for animal rights group PETA. In the footage, she explains she has become a vegetarian in protest at how the meat industry is causing a depletion of the world’s water supplies. Despite claiming that she can take ‘guilt free’ long showers because she does not support the meat trade, she said: ‘Normally at home I’m not used to the habit of a shower. I just wash my bits and rush out in the morning and more often than not get in the bath after Andreas. She added: ‘I’m sorry but whatever you do is helpful. We have to start somewhere. ‘I know PETA because I’m a big friend of Pamela Anderson and Chrissie Hynde and they introduced me to it. That’s why I wanted to accept the invitation to do something to help stop cruelty to animals. ‘This is about how precious water is, it’s more important than the gas that the people want to dig up and we’re prepared to poison our water for that for example. Eating meat is one of the most environmentally damaging things it’s possible to do. ‘I’m a person who’s got enough money to make choices and this is my choice. We don’t need to eat animals, there’s too many of us anyway and eating animals is destroying the world. I believe that we are an endangered species and we need to think about what we’re doing. We’re probably killing our-selves through eating meat.’ The 72 year old has taken a step back from fashion designing to focus on her environmental campaigning work . The video, which also features Dame Vivienne taking a shower, is being released in advance of World Water Day on 22 March. A European study recently claimed that it takes 4m gallons of water to produce one ton of beef, but just 85,000 gallons to produce a ton of vegetables. Another UN study singles out the meat industry as one of the leading causes of climate change. Dame Vivienne is best-known for creating the punk look, with its zips, rips and chains, which was famously adopted by the Sex Pistols in the 1970s. Initially working as a primary school teacher, she and Malcolm McLaren, one-time manager of the Sex Pistols, opened a shop called Let It Rock - also known as Sex - where she began selling her outrageous outfits. The punk style included bondage gear, safety pins, razor blades, bicycle or lavatory chains and spiked dog collars. She had a brief marriage to factory apprentice Derek Westwood in the 1960s, before marrying her former fashion student Andreas Kronthaler, an Austrian who is 25 years her junior, in 1992. Earlier this year, the designer shaved off her mane of fiery red hair to help raise awareness about global warming. She has been a long-time campaigner against the unsustainable use of the planet’s resources and even attributing fashion collections to a matter she believes passionately about. Earlier this year she announced she won’t be expanding the fashion side of her business — a decision made to give the designer more time to focus on her work with Greenpeace. She has also promised to donate £1m to fund eco-friendly projects, while she is also one of the few catwalk designers who advocates ethical fashion and dismisses spending thousands of euro on clothes that will never be worn.","The 72-year-old designer admits to not showering every day .

Vice President Joe Biden has landed in Warsaw on a mission to reassure allies in eastern Europe that Washington understands their anxieties about Russia's actions in Ukraine and will protect them if needed. The countries have become increasingly nervous that they could be next in line to face aggression from Russia after President Vladimir Putin's interventions to annex Ukraine's Crimea region. Biden has said that the world has seen through Russia's actions in Crimea and will impose more sanctions on Russia. Scroll down for video . Serious show of support: Vice President Joe Biden met with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Tuesday in an effort to figure out how the U.S. can help support Russia's neighbors in case they continue their expansion . Laughing off concerns: Biden's trip comes after President Obama issued sanctions against top Putin aides for their role in actively pursuing a Crimean succession from the Ukraine . He says the U.S. joins Poland and the . international community in condemning the continuing assault on . Ukraine's sovereignty. He says it's a blatant violation of international . law. Biden says . virtually the entire world rejects the referendum in Crimea that cleared . the way for Russia to annex the peninsula in Ukraine. On . the two-day mission launched today, Biden plans to discuss ways to help . the region become less dependent on Russian oil and gas and limit . Moscow's ability to use its energy supplies for political leverage, a . senior administration official said. He will also talk about new ways NATO and the United States could support their allies. These talks build upon U.S. participation last week in war games in Poland and increased fighter jet patrols in the Baltics. 'He will be talking about further steps that the United States can take and that NATO can take as an alliance to further ensure the security of Poland and the Baltics and other NATO alliances,' the official told reporters travelling with Biden. 'They'll discuss energy security, and including in that, long-term diversification of energy supply, so that energy can't be used as a political tool,' the official said, citing shale gas and nuclear power as two areas for discussion. Helping hand: Biden, seen here with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski, is on a two-day trip in Eastern Europe . The United States is poised to become a major exporter of liquefied natural gas in coming years, making inroads into a market that Russia currently dominates. Natural gas importers from around the world have urged the Obama administration to speed up approvals of additional export facilities so they can become less reliant on Russia. On Tuesday, Biden is scheduled to meet with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Bronislaw Komorowski. He will also hold talks with Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who is in Warsaw on an official visit. Addressing the issue: Biden, sitting at right, meets with Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, left and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, third left begin talks in Warsaw about ways the U.S. can help them stand strong against Russia . On Wednesday in Vilnius, Biden will meet with Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and Latvian President Andris Berzins. NATO's top military commander Air Force General Philip Breedlove is also slated to meet with chiefs of defense in central and eastern Europe to discuss security issues this week, the official said. Biden's trip will serve to underscore to the leaders, as well as to countries like the Czech Republic and Hungary, that 'we've got their back', said Julianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to Biden, in an interview before the trip. The message is also aimed partly at Russia, warning Putin to think twice before messing with NATO allies, said Smith, now with the Center for a New American Security think-tank in Washington. Warm welcome: Biden gestures as he arrives at the Okecie military airport in Warsaw, Poland, Tuesday March 18, 2014 as part of a 'listening tour' Biden also wants to get an assessment from leaders about the impact of sanctions imposed this week by the United States and European Union, the senior administration official told Reuters. As neighbors of Russia, with close economic ties, retaliation for sanctions could be an issue. 'He's going to hear an earful,' said Heather Conley of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington. For Poland and the Baltics, which like Ukraine, were formerly part of the Soviet Union, watching the Crimean crisis unfold is a 'nightmare scenario', Conley said in an interview. Early in his presidency, Obama scaled back plans for missile defense systems based in eastern Europe, adding to anxieties for neighbors of Russia. But there is no consideration being given to changing those plans, the senior administration official told reporters.","Vice President landed in Warsaw on Tuesday as part of a two-day 'listening tour' to help show support for allies near Russia .

The 14-year-old was photographed puffing on a fag at Taru Jurug Zoo in Solo, Central Java, Indonesia. Guests are throwing pre-lit cigarette butts to the adult male known as Kirno then laughing as he smokes like a human. It is thought he learnt how to smoke by imitating zoo visitors. And it comes just two years after another of the zoo's orangutans, Tori, had to be moved to an island to quit her cigarette habit. A zoo spokesperson said: 'It is difficult to prevent the visitors from giving cigarettes to Kirno. 'Many visitors misbehave. Smoking habits in orangutans are dangerous and can lead to a lack of appetite.' The photographer Agoes Rudianto who captured the images said: 'I was photographing the animals at the zoo when I got to Kirno's cage and spotted him smoking. 'I saw there were visitors taking pictures on their phones and laughing.' Dr Grainne McEntee, head of Ooperations at Orangutan Protection Foundation, added: 'Mimicry is a well-known behavioural characteristic in primates. It is how they learn, much as human children do. 'In . a captive environment, with little to do, intelligent primates commonly . resort to mimicry to keep themselves occupied, and whilst we accept . zoos as a normal part of present day society, it is nonetheless very sad . to witness captive animals being presented with the opportunity to copy . some of the least acceptable aspects of human behaviour.'

Native to Indonesia and Malaysia, orangutans are currently found in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. They are the two exclusively Asian species of extant great apes. Orangutans spend most of their time in trees. Their hair is typically reddish-brown, instead of the brown or black hair typical of chimpanzees and gorillas. And males and females differ in size and appearance - dominant adult males have distinctive cheek pads and produce long calls that attract females and intimidate rivals. Younger males do not have these characteristics and resemble adult females. Fruit is the most important component of an orangutan's diet; however, the apes will also eat vegetation, bark, honey, insects and even bird eggs. They can live over 30 years in both the wild and captivity.","The teenager began smoking lit cigarettes thrown into his pen by zoo visitors .

Israel has accused the United States of projecting weakness internationally and said it could not rely on its main ally to take the lead in confronting Iran over its nuclear programme. Defence minister Moshe Yaalon, whose remarks were reported in the Haaretz daily, caused friction with the United States only two months ago when he described Secretary of State John Kerry's quest for Israeli-Palestinian peace as messianic and obsessive. His latest comments, confirmed by an Israeli official who was present at a lecture Mr Yaalon delivered at Tel Aviv University yesterday, displayed deep disappointment with U.S. President Barack Obama's handling of burning world issues. Disappointed: Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said he could not rely on the U.S. to help in confronting Iran over its controversial nuclear programme . 'We had thought it would be the United States that would lead the campaign against Iran,' said Yaalon, who pointed to the Ukraine crisis as an example of Washington 'showing weakness'. He added: 'If your image is feebleness, it doesn’t pay in the world. Nobody will replace the United States as global policeman. 'I hope the United States comes to its senses. If it doesn’t, it will challenge the world order, and the United States is the one that will suffer.' It was unclear from Mr Yaalon's reported remarks where he believed the United States, which on Monday imposed sanctions on two top aides to President Vladimir Putin and nine other people linked to Russia's Crimean incursion, had gone wrong on Ukraine. Iran and six world powers will try to make headway on the nuclear dispute in talks that started in Vienna today, with Western officials hoping the challenge will not be made even more difficult by the Ukraine crisis. Unrest: Members of Ukrainian self-defense forces in training on the Novi Petrivtsi shooting range near Kiev. Mr Yaalon pointed to the crisis as an example of Washington 'showing weakness' against Russia . Attempting to make headway: European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton (left) and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohamad Javad Zarif wait for the start of closed-door nuclear talks in Vienna on Tuesday . Mr Yaalon said that although 'people know Iran cheats', the United States and other nations chose to negotiate with Tehran on restricting activities they fear are aimed at developing atomic arms. 'Therefore, on this matter, we have to behave as though we have nobody to look out for us but ourselves,' Yaalon said, echoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's veiled threats of unilateral military action against Iran if diplomacy fails. 'Unfortunately, when it comes to negotiating at a Persian bazaar, the Iranians are better,' said Yaalon, a former armed forces chief and a hawkish member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party. In the Middle East, Yaalon said, he had heard 'voices of disappointment' over a lack of U.S. support for Sunni Muslim rebels in the three-year-old conflict in Syria. Attacked: Mr Yaalon criticised President Barack Obama's handling of world issues months after he described Secretary of State John Kerry's quest for Israeli-Palestinian peace as messianic and obsessive . And on a recent visit in Asia, he added, he found 'disappointment about China getting stronger and the U.S. getting weaker'. Netanyahu, whose country is widely believed to be the Middle East's only nuclear-armed nation, has denounced as a 'historic mistake' an interim deal reached with Iran in November on curbing sensitive nuclear activities in return for limited sanctions relief. He has demanded that any final accord dismantle Tehran's uranium enrichment centrifuges, a position at odds with Obama's suggestion that Iran, which says its nuclear programme is peaceful, could be allowed to enrich on a limited basis for civilian purposes. 'Comfortable Westerners prefer to put off confrontation, if possible to next year or the next leadership term. But in the end, it will blow up,' Yaalon said.","Israeli defence minister has criticised Obama's handling of world issues .

Climate change will wreak havoc on the world and its population, causing mass migration, malnutrition and war, according to a leaked official report. An official publication by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which will be made public at the end of this month, paints a bleak picture of how global warming will affect the globe. The draft report, the second of three by the IPCC, was written by hundreds of respected scientists and offers the most comprehensive look ever at the impact of climate change on the planet. A leaked UN report warns climate change will mean more devastating floods, as happened in Pakistan in 2010 . Based on thousands of studies, the paper predicts that by the end of the 21st century, 'hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding and displaced, due to land loss', it was reported today. It warns that such forced mass migration will lead to violent conflict, particularly in Asia, while the flooding will result in a two per cent drop in crop yields every decade for the rest of the century. As a result, the UN report says, millions more children under the age of five will suffer from malnutrition, while people in many regions will be at greater risk of water-borne diseases, injury or death from flooding, heatwaves or fire. The global economy will suffer, too, with global GDP predicted to drop by $1.4trn (£841billion) as a result of rising temperatures. According to a report in the Independent, the report shows that the effect of this predicted climate change on Britain will be comparatively small, and will include rising food prices, worse air pollution leading to increased asthma and hay fever.  Also under threat are some of Scotland and Ireland's rare coastal habitats and peatlands, and Britain's grouse moors. The report, by the IPCC's Working Group II, will be considered by the IPCC in Yokohama, Japan, on 25-29 March.  The first report came out last September, a third report, by Working Group III, will be published in the second week of April, and a final, sythesis report will be discussed in Copenhagen in October this year. Mass migration: Flooding will force people to migrate, leading to violent conflict, the report says (stock image) By the end of the 21st century, 'hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding and displaced, due to land loss', the report predicts.  Rising sea levels will mean coastal flooding, submergence and coastal emergence, it says, with the worst hit areas east Asia, south-east Asia, and south Asia. Existing health problems will be made worse by the changing climate until around 2050, the report says, after which people will face the threat of injury, water-borne disease, and death from flooding, heatwaves and fire. Flooding and heatwaves will lead to mass migration, a key cause in conflict.  The report says increased poverty and decreasing food supplies will increase the likelihood of violent conflicts, as will migrating fish stocks from one country's territory to another, and changes in water sources and sea ice. Air pollution, as shown in Jakarta, Indonesia, will increase as a result of climate change, the IPCC report says . The IPCC report suggests that a rise in average global temperature of 2.5C from pre-industrial levels may lead to a drastic drop in global GDP. Even small increases of around 1C will mean a reduction in yields of maize, wheat and rice in tropical and temperate regions, the report warns, with an average reduction in yields of two per cent per decade for the rest of the century.  Meanwhile global demand is set to increase. Coastal habitats in Scotland and Ireland, such as machair and peatlands, may be under threat from climate change, along with British grouse moors. The draft report says that 'freshwater-related risks of climate change increase significantly with increasing greenhouse gas emissions', and says competition for freshwater will increase as renewable ground water and surface water resources dwindle. Rare habitats, such as this machair grassy plain in Uist, Outer Hebrides, may be threatened, the report warns .","Draft report by UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change leaked .

Kate Downey, who turned 30 last month, was found dead in a Premier Inn in Newcastle on Saturday, four months after her partner, John-Paul Conley, drowned in a river on the island of Don Phon. Archaeologist Miss Downey, from Middlesbrough, was found by police and paramedics days before a tribute evening to her 35-year-old boyfriend was due to be held in the couple's home town. Kate Downey, 30, whose boyfriend John-Paul Conley, 35, died in November in Laos, has been found dead . Police say they believe no-one else was involved in her death, and a post-mortem will be scheduled to identify the cause.

George Osborne today insisted that Britain was recovering from the after-effects of the recession - and he seems to have bounced back from his own personal recession too. Observers noted that the Chancellor's hair appeared thicker than on Budget day last year, with his bald spot less obvious than it previously was. The 42-year-old is also said to have slimmed down over the past year after taking up the '5:2 Diet', cutting his calorie intake to just 500 on two days of the week. Spot the difference: George Osborne's hair appeared thinner last year, left, than it did this year, right . Slimmed down: After taking up the 5:2 diet, cutting his calorie intake to 500 for two days a week, the Chancellor has a new svelte figure to accompany his newly-full head of hair . Mr Osborne delivered a relentlessly upbeat message during today's Budget, as he announced a series of giveaways to voters a year before the next general election. However, some people were more focussed on the Chancellor's appearance than his message, pointing out the visible transformation he has undergone in recent months. Rich Morgan tweeted: 'What's going on with George Osborne's hair, it kind of looks like he's doing a big old comb-forward.' Nicola Borasinski added: 'George Osborne's hair is fooling no-one. Definitely a dye job, possibly even a toupee.' Style: The Chancellor abandoned his old hairstyle, left, in favour of a more youthful-looking cut, right . Diet: Mr Osborne adopted a new diet and fitness regime in a bid to shed the pounds . One website speculated that Mr Osborne could have started dying his hair or even undergone a hair transplant. However, others suggested that he had simply mastered the favourite trick of many middle-aged men and managed to comb his hair to make it appear thicker in strategic places. Last year he radically changed his hairstyle, adopting a 'layered' look which was widely thought to be an attempt to look younger. Tucking in: Last year, he was pictured with a Byron burger, chips and fizzy drinks to get through the Budget . Despite regular runs, he remained rotund - until taking up his new regime this year . Viewers took to Twitter to comment on the Chancellor's new, sharp look on The Andrew Marr Show last Sunday . Mr Osborne is also believed to have lost several pounds since adopting the 5:2 Diet, which involves two days of 'fasting' every week. On the popular diet, which has also . been taken up by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, followers 'fast' for two . non-consecutive days, and eat normally for the remaining five. After six weeks, they can lose up to a stone, it is claimed. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is said to be experimenting with alternatives to dairy, and Education Secretary Michael Gove has shifted two stone at a £2,500 'fat farm' retreat in Austria. But the Chancellor's personal austerity was not matched by his announcements in today's Budget, when he cut the price of beer and lowered the tax on bingo.","George Osborne's hair is looking thicker than this time last year .

"By . Laura Clark . PUBLISHED: . 19:53 EST, 19 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:53 EST, 19 March 2014 . One school playing field has been sold off every two weeks since the London 2012 Olympics, new figures have revealed. Ministers have given the nod to 26 sales since pledging to use the games to deliver a sporting legacy for children. The Coalition promised to ‘seek to protect school playing fields’ when it formed in May 2010. Official figures show that 57 disposals of school fields have been authorised since 2010, despite promises that this would not happen . But official figures show that 57 have been approved for sale since then - and the pace of sell-offs quickened in the year of the Olympics. The Government said pitches which had been approved for disposal were often unused or surplus to schools’ requirements. It said the proceeds of disposals must be reinvested in either sporting or educational facilities. The Sport and Recreation Alliance, representing more than 300 sporting organisations, said that access to decent facilities was a ‘pre-requisite to tackling the growing crisis of inactivity among young people’. The figures show that 14 sell-offs were allowed in the first year of the Coalition and 12 between May 2011 and April 2012. The following year numbers had risen to 19, and in the six months between May 2013 and October 2013 – the latest period for which figures are available – 12 had already been approved. The sites are often sold onto housing developers. Despite the pledges, the spectacle and pageantry of the 2012 London Olympics has failed to save school fields around the country . In six cases, the Government over-ruled its own advisory body to force through sales. As the country celebrated Team GB’s success in the August 2012 Olympics, David Cameron pledged to use the inspiration of the games to ‘get children playing sport more regularly’, particularly competitive sport. In that year, Education Secretary Michael Gove was forced to apologise after it emerged the number of sell-offs under the Coalition was higher than it had previously admitted. He was also criticised for rejecting the advice of the School Playing Fields Advisory Panel – a committee of independent experts which is legally bound to make recommendations on each sale application. A new report outlines disposals since May 2010 and the reasons for each. In 38 cases, schools closed or merged with others. In seven, the land was leased to other organisations, with pupils able to use it during school hours. In 12 cases, the land concerned was ‘small sections of playing field…that either isn’t used by the school for sport or is not needed due to other facilities in place’. The Department for Education said: ‘No open school has disposed of its entire playing field, and in every case all of the money made by the local authority or school from the sale will be invested in local sports or education facilities. ‘Every school must, by law, have access to enough playing field space to allow for its sports and curriculum needs to be met.’ It said the number of disposals was falling. An average of 28 applications per year were approved under the last Labour government, against an average of 16 annually under the Coalition. Sallie Barker, interim chief executive at the Sport and Recreation Alliance, said it had particular concerns about the potential for land sell-offs at newly-built academies and free schools. ‘There is no room for complacency and access to decent facilities is a pre-requisite to tackling the growing crisis of inactivity among young people.’","One school sold every two weeks since the London 2012 Olympics .

Savers have been given a vital boost with a series of radical reforms – including the creation of a ‘super Isa’ and introduction of lucrative tax breaks. From July 1, everyone can put up to £15,000 into a new, simpler type of tax-free savings account which will allow savers to put away almost three times more than they can currently in a cash Isa. In the new account, they will be able to move their money easily between the stockmarket and regular high street deals in a bid to get the best possible return from their nest eggs. From July 1, everyone can put up to £15,000 into a new, simpler type of tax-free savings account . The launch of the Money Mail campaign on September 12, 2012 . The Treasury has called these New Individual Savings Accounts, or Nisas – but yesterday they were already being dubbed the super Isa because of the lucrative perks they bring. It marks a major victory for Money Mail’s Get Britain Saving campaign, which called for one Isa allowance which allows savers to move freely between cash and shares. On top of this, the Chancellor declared . that around 1.5million with small incomes that are boosted by money they . have in a savings account will get a £1,000 tax break on their . interest. Peter and Karen Walker  (pictured with twin daughters Lucy and Sophie) were delighted with the Chancellor’s decision to raise the annual Isa allowance to £15,000. Mrs Walker, 48, shops around for the best Isa interest rates and then uses the full allowance each year whenever she can. After overcoming cancer in 2001, Mrs Walker likes to save money for family holidays so she can spend quality time with her daughters. Mrs Walker said: ‘I put anything we have to spare into savings. Now that the limit has been raised we will take advantage of that and save the full £15,000 so long as we can find a good interest rate. ‘Family holidays are really important to us. We’ll be taking the girls to Disneyworld in Florida over Easter which will be wonderful.’ Mrs Walker works as an IT project manager earning £41,768, and her husband earns £48,400 as a transport manager. They have two cash Isas at present – a Nationwide Isa with a 2.5 per cent interest rate and £5,760 in the account, and a Post Office Isa with a 2.51 per cent rate holding £3,000. As well as saving, their priority is to pay off the mortgage on their £400,000. three-bed home in Swindon. The announcements were described as a lifeline for the savings classes who have been hard hit during the recovery from the financial crisis. The prudent have seen their incomes slashed since the Bank of England reduced base rate to a historic low of 0.5 per cent in March 2009. Rates on high street accounts were cut further when the Government’s Funding for Lending Scheme was introduced in summer 2012. This gave the banks a cheap source of funds, and meant they no longer needed money from savers. Campaigner group Save Our Savers estimates savers have lost as much as £117billion in interest since the financial crisis began. Anna Bowes, director of website Savings Champion, said: ‘The prudent have been bearing the brunt of the financial meltdown, and have been for some time now. ‘Allowing people to put more into an account and giving them flexibility to move their money in and out of the stockmarket is a huge boost. This really is the most radical transformation of the way we save for decades.’ Since Isas were first introduced 15 years ago they have proved wildly popular because of the tax breaks, as you do not pay any tax on the interest or the profits you make. By the end of 2013, £443billion was held in these accounts, with just under half of this in cash. Under current rules taxpayers can put a maximum of £11,520 into an Isa every tax year. The entirety of this allowance can be put into stocks and shares, but a maximum of half – £5,760 – can be put away in cash. Savers can move money from existing cash Isa accounts into stocks and shares, but cannot transfer the other way. This means that those approaching retirement who want to protect their savings by moving them out of the stockmarket are not allowed to do so. But with the new super Isa, savers will get one allowance of £15,000 every tax year. It will be up to them how much they want to put into each type, and they will be allowed to move between shares and cash when they like. To further boost their popularity the Treasury announced that peer-to-peer lending – through so-called lend-to-save websites – would also be allowed to be held in an Isa. With these sites a saver effectively lends out their cash directly to borrowers, cutting out the bank in the middle. And in one final helping hand that will help around 1.5million savers the Chancellor also declared that those on small income should no longer have to pay tax on the first £5,000 of savings interest they make – effectively handing them a £1,000 tax break. Around 189,000 will be taken out of paying any tax altogether. Currently, poorer savers get a £279 tax break as they are given a 10p rate on the first £2,790 of interest they earn.","The new Isa will allow three times more money to be saved tax free .

A young woman left bald by a condition which compels her to tear out her hair says she will not allow the affliction to destroy her life. Ruth Walters, 22, began plucking and picking at her hair following a traumatic incident eight years ago. Since then she has pulled out clumps of hair as a way to ease anxiety in trance-like episodes which can last for hours at a time. Ruth Walters wears a wig and says she is terrified of it falling off in public and revealing her real hair . She suffers from the condition trichotillomania, which causes her to feel compelled to pull her hair out, resulting in baldness . Today, Miss Walters, of Grantham, Lincolnshire, wears a £3,000 wig to hide her baldness from strangers. She said: ‘It's my safety blanket. My hand is always close to the top of my head and I pluck hairs while I'm driving, working and eating. The only time I don't do it is when I'm fast asleep. ‘I'm determined to get the better of it. I'm sick and tired of feeling as if I'm lying to people. ‘Opening up about the condition will break down any denial I'm feeling and help me start to fight back against it.’ Miss Walters traces her compulsive behaviour to when she was 14 years old, when she believes she was involuntarily drugged on a night out with friends. She said: ‘I have patchy memories of having one drink, then leaving the pub and going to my friend's house. That's all I remember of the night. Miss Walters spends hours at a time pulling out her hair while in a trace-like state . Miss Walters (pictured at 14, just before the condition developed) believes the condition developed as a result of a traumatic experience eight years ago when she believes her drink was spiked . ‘Although I have no recollection of most of the evening I'm inclined to believe my drink was spiked by someone at the pub. That's the only explanation which makes any sense. ‘Anything could have happened to me while I was unconscious, which is an extremely frightening thought.’ As her anxiety mounted she found the most effective way to reduce her stress was to pick at stray hairs. Trichotillomania is a condition which causes a person to feel compelled to pull out their hair. They may pull it out from their head, eyebrows, eyelashes or the rest of their body. It is an impulse-control disorder which causes the sufferer to feel an intense urge to pull hair and a growing anxiety until they do so. After they have pulled out some hair they feel a sense of relief. The condition can be so severe that it causes bald patches. It can also cause feeling of guilt, embarrassment and may lead to low self-esteem and even depression. The most effective treatment is therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy. The condition is most common in teenagers and young adults and is thought to affect up to four per cent of people. It is more common in girls than boys and usually starts in the early teens. Source: NHS Choices . She said: ‘My sister noticed I had been pulling at the gap separating my fringe. She noticed the signs because she had previously done the same thing for around nine months. The behaviour is quite closely linked to genetics.’ When she was 15, Miss Walters was referred to her GP who diagnosed trichotillomania - a complex psychological disorder spanning categories of self-harm and addiction. Like many sufferers, Miss Walters became depressed when she realised what she was doing. She said: ‘When I'm doing it, I'm not aware of what's going on around me - the plucking is the only thing I'm focussed on. I'll sit there for hours doing it, not moving, not going to the toilet, not eating. ‘It's a very intense feeling which relieves something, although it's difficult to describe what. It's the equivalent of shooting up morphine to get off your face to forget about things. It serves the same purpose. ‘From the early days I was conscious of what I was doing and I knew it was out-of-the-ordinary. It's a bit difficult not to notice when half your hair is collecting on the desk in front of you. ‘It's sobering when you realise the severity of your behaviour. It can trigger a spiral into depression.’ Today she is receiving treatment through medication and cognitive behavioural therapy and is being supported by Josh, her boyfriend of three years. She said: ‘It's got worse over the last eight years. Josh doesn't care what I look like, but he cares about how I'm feeling and knows it's something I need to address on my own. If he could fix it, he would, but he knows he can't. ‘I care a lot about fashion. I always pay close attention to what I'm wearing and I'm careful to look nice. I was even approached by modelling scouts when I was younger at a fashion show in London, and then again later at university. Miss Walters (pictured wearing a wig) said: 'It's my safety blanket. My hand is always close to the top of my head and I pluck hairs while I'm driving, working and eating. The only time I don't do it is when I'm fast asleep' Miss Walters says wearing a wig makes her feel she is being dishonest to herself and to everyone else . ‘I'm known as the girl with the confidence and the great hair. But once that's all stripped away, people would realise the great hair is a wig and I'm very insecure. ‘When people say I look pretty I think, “if only you knew”. Until I can show what's going on beneath the “mask” I put on for people, I feel as if I'm being dishonest to everyone and myself.’ Miss Walters wears a high-quality wig which she ordered from America. Such hairpieces are worth thousands of pounds, but they are prone to movement, leading to embarrassing moments. Miss Walters said: ‘My worst fear is a gust of wind catching it and sending it upwards, revealing my secret. Miss Walters (pictured wearing a wig) said: 'When I'm doing it, I'm not aware of what's going on around me - the plucking is the only thing I'm focussed on. I'll sit there for hours doing it, not moving, not going to the toilet, not eating' ‘My family want to me to shave my head, but that's an option of last resort. ‘You only need to talk to chemotherapy patients to appreciate what it means to women to lose their hair. ‘My hair still feels like a huge part of my identity and to get to a point where I decide to get rid of it completely would be a massive step.’ She said a low point came shortly after she achieved her psychology degree, when she was working as a carer for people on the autistic spectrum. She said: ‘A patient grabbed my hairpiece and lifted it up, showing my real hair underneath. It was mortifying. I'd only divulged the truth to my managers, and the wig coming off showed everyone that I was dealing with issues of my own. ‘Whenever I disclose the situation to people they're very kind and promise not to be judgemental. Miss Walters (pictured wearing a wig) said: 'This is an intensely personal issue, but looking beyond my situation, I think there should be more done to raise awareness of conditions like trichotillomania' Miss Walters is having treatment and also hopes to raise awareness about anxiety disorders . ‘But the truth is people do judge you on how you look - and they judge you as a person, not just the way you appear. I wonder all the time what people's responses would be, what they would think of me.’ Miss Walters says there should be greater understanding and education about anxious disorders and how they affect young people. She said: ‘This is an intensely personal issue, but looking beyond my situation, I think there should be more done to raise awareness of conditions like trichotillomania. ‘People are suffering because the problem is often not diagnosed and treated correctly, and I don't think that should continue.’","Ruth Walters developed trichotillomania when she was 14 .

Betting machines dubbed the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling will be taxed more heavily – but  campaigners and the industry say the duty rise will not help problem gambling. In a blow for bookmakers, whose shares fell yesterday, George Osborne said Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) were ‘highly lucrative’ and he was hiking the levy on them from 20 per cent to 25 per cent. The Mail has campaigned against the machines, which are found in high street betting shops and allow users to lose up to £100 per spin. Critics say they are highly addictive and make casino-style gambling accessible on the high street. Addictive: The Mail has campaigned against the machines, dubbed the 'crack cocaine' of gambling . They have been blamed for a rise in problem gambling and account for half of bookies’ earnings. The move could wipe £79 million off the industry’s profits but campaigners say it does nothing to address the high stakes of the machines and recent proliferation of them on high streets. Adrian Parkinson, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said: ‘It may well aid the Treasury, but does little to deal with the many issues created by these machines. ‘Problem gambling research, education and treatment will not see any of this revenue, and the addictive nature of FOBTs means the bookmakers will still be raking in huge sums.’ He said ministers should focus on the ‘social and economic cost’ of problem gambling, which far outweighed the  revenue the machines generated – even at 25 per cent. ‘The Government should be dealing with the root of the rather than tax the losses of those addicted to them . . . but with only one NHS problem  gambling clinic in the UK, this seems a long way off,’ he said. Mr Osborne said: ‘Fixed-odds betting terminals have proliferated since gambling laws were liberalised almost a decade ago. These machines are highly  lucrative and therefore it’s right we now raise the duty on them to 25 per cent.’ Britain’s 33,000 FOBTs have been under mounting scrutiny in recent months – with the Mail leading campaigns to highlight their dangers. The machines allow players to stake up to £100 a time on a  20-second spin of a wheel for games such as virtual roulette. George Osborne said Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) were 'highly lucrative' and he was hiking the levy on them from 20 per cent to 25 per cent . Bookmakers are allowed a maximum four FOBTs in each of their premises. They have become so popular that it is claimed they account for up to 80 per cent of the profits in some high street betting offices. The Association of British Bookmakers said they paid £50 million tax on the machines last year and claimed this move would threaten 15,000 jobs and 3,000 betting shops. A spokesman said: ‘Thirty per cent of our shops make less than £300 profit in a week, and many are small family-run businesses. This knee-jerk and ill-considered tax raid means their futures are now on the line.’ The association also said yesterday’s move would have ‘absolutely no impact on levels of problem gambling in the UK’. The industry is working with the Government on a voluntary code to address concerns about FOBTs, and betting bosses have mounted the bizarre defence that the revenue they generate supports horse and greyhound racing. Shares in the bookmakers plunged yesterday following the announcement, wiping millions of pounds off their value. Ladbrokes, the second largest firm, saw its shares slump by 12 per cent, and William Hill, the  market leader, dropped 7 per cent.  Bookies claim the tax hike will cost the industry £79 million a year.","Campaigners and the industry say the rise will not help problem gambling .

"By . Richard Spillett . PUBLISHED: . 12:28 EST, 19 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:35 EST, 19 March 2014 . A house husband who claims he sacrificed his own ambitions to help the career of his investment banker wife has won a crucial round in the couple's £11million divorce battle. Stay-at-home father, Weng Choy, and 'breadwinner' wife, Lena Tan, lived a luxury lifestyle during their 15-year marriage, with homes in Hong Kong and Malaysia, a £1million wine collection and £4.5million apartment in Kensington. But Mr Choy filed for divorce from his working wife in January 2012, after a blazing row days earlier on New Year’s Eve proved 'the final straw'. Investment banker Lena Tan, left, and house husband Wang Choy, right, are locked in a battle over their £11million fortune after Mr Choy filed for divorce . After a legal wrangle over where their big-money divorce case should be heard, Mr Choy won a victory today, when appeal judges found he was entitled to fight his case before an English family judge. Mr Choy, 56, had filed for divorce in the English High Court, seeking a slice of marital assets valued by lawyers at £11 million. He says he abandoned his own promising banking career to care for the couple’s two sons whilst his high-flying wife went out to work. But his wife's legal team hit back - insisted that he had no right to divorce in England. Three Appeal Court judges today ruled Mr Choy could have his case heard in the UK because he had been ‘habitually resident’ in this country for a year before their split. The ruling will come as a blow to his 54-year-old wife, a leading hedge fund manager, because of a world-wide perception that English judges are generous to the partners of rich spouses. Mrs Tan's barrister, James Turner QC, had earlier told the court that, following a falling out in London’s Holland Park in September 2010, the couple’s marriage hit a 'crisis', but survived until it 'struck the rock of the row on New Year’s Eve 2011'. The couple lived a high-flying lifestyle with homes in Hong Kong (pictured), Malaysia and London's Kensington . Judges have ruled the big-money case can be heard in England because Mr Choy had lived in London for a year before filing for divorce . Her lawyers claimed that, despite over half the couple’s wealth being invested in the UK, the divorce case should be heard in Malaysia. The QC also asked the judges to consider the 'convenience' to Mrs Tan 'bearing in mind the need for her physical presence in Malaysia' - and the fact that her husband 'is not gainfully employed.' However, Timothy Bishop QC, for Mr Choy, insisted his home had been in London since 2010 and that he had been forming closer ties with the city for the last 20 years. He said: 'The judge found that they had an international marriage which, from 1998, involved them moving around the world following the wife’s work. Appeal judges at London's Royal Courts of Justice have ruled the £11million divorce case can be heard by an English court . 'They owned property, they had homes in a number of countries - England, Singapore and Malaysia...but the jewel in the crown of their assets was the South Kensington apartment, worth £4-£4.75m, never mortgaged, never let out. 'After the marriage broke down...the husband’s centre of interests ceased to be dictated by the wife’s working life'. Ruling in Mr Choy’s favour, Lady Justice Macur, sitting with Sir Brian Leveson and Lord Justice Aikens, accepted that London had been his ‘permanent and stable’ home in the crucial 12 months before he petitioned for divorce. The judges backed a family judge’s earlier ruling that an English court was the ‘appropriate forum’ for the warring ex-couple to fight it out over their assets. During the case, Mr Choy's lawyer said outside court: 'Mr Choy was also a banker, but he quit his job to look after the children and to support his wife in her career.'","House husband Weng Choy says helped his wife's career by staying at home .
