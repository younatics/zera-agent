"(CNN)This week, Republicans will take over the Senate, thanks to the American people's overwhelming support in the 2014 elections, and our first priority for the next two years will be alleviating the economic pain the American people have experienced under the Obama administration. More than five years after the recession officially ended, too many Americans are still feeling the pinch.  Wages have remained stagnant, and median household income has dropped almost $3,000 on the President's watch.  Meanwhile, prices for everything from groceries to education have risen.  And instead of helping, most of the administration's policies have had a negative impact on the economy. Just last week we learned from an employer survey that a majority of small businesses say that Obamacare has reduced their profits, causing many of them to freeze or cut workers' wages or reduce other benefits. Despite all this, this week the President will be conducting a campaign-style tour in an attempt to claim credit for the sliver of positive economic news we're finally seeing after six bleak years under his policies.  Unfortunately, the President's attempted victory lap can't disguise the fact that our economy is still nowhere near where it should be. But there is reason to be hopeful. The new Republican majority will get right to work on job-creating legislation, starting with legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which the President's own State Department has admitted will support more than 42,000 jobs during construction. Keystone XL enjoys bipartisan support in both houses of Congress, and I hope the President will finally sign off on this job-creating project. Republicans will also take up two other bipartisan jobs measures that were stuck in the Democrat-led Senate for far too long.  We are committed to repealing the job-killing Obamacare medical device tax, a tax on life-saving medical devices like pacemakers and insulin pumps. This tax has already eliminated thousands of jobs in the medical device industry, and it's on track to eliminate thousands more if it isn't repealed. Given the economic stagnation of the past six years, the last thing our economy needs is a tax that is eliminating thousands of jobs. Republicans will also work to repeal the Obamacare provision that changed the definition of full-time employment from 40 hours a week to 30 hours.  This provision has forced countless businesses to cut back on hiring or reduce workers' hours and wages, which has meant fewer jobs and opportunities for American workers.  Eliminating this provision has bipartisan support, and Republicans look forward to taking it up this year. In addition to passing job-creating legislation, Republicans will also make oversight a priority in the new Congress.  Executive branch agencies have run amok over the past few years, and it's time to rein them in.  The Obama Environmental Protection Agency, to name just one agency, has proposed regulations that would drive Americans' energy prices through the roof and result in the loss of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands,of American jobs.  It is long past time for Congress to assert its oversight authority to protect Americans, particularly those who can least afford it, from this kind of executive overreach. While we hope to work with Democrats as much as possible, the new Republican majority will not hesitate to draw bright lines between Democrat and Republican priorities.  Republicans are committed to fundamental reforms, like transforming our tax code to make it simpler and fairer, cutting job-killing regulations and passing trade promotion authority so American goods can compete on an even playing field internationally. Republicans are going to get Washington working for Americans again.  Under our control, the Senate will return to regular order, which means bills will be considered out in the open in committees before coming to the Senate floor, and all senators, regardless of party, will have a chance to propose and debate amendments. Over the past few years of Democrat control in the Senate, too often the minority party was shut out of the legislative process, leading to dysfunction and gridlock.  Under Republican control, the Senate will get back to work.  Creating jobs and encouraging economic growth should be bipartisan priorities, and we look forward to working with Democrats on everything from repealing the job-killing medical device tax to approving the job-creating Keystone XL pipeline.  We hope Democrats and the President will join us.","Sen. John Thune: New GOP majority in Senate will focus on boosting economy .

"(CNN)China's foreign ministry has lodged a diplomatic complaint to North Korea after Chinese local media reports said an army deserter killed four people near the China-North Korea border. A North Korean soldier fleeing the country shot four Chinese citizens after a robbery attempt in late December in Helong, a city near the Tumen River that divides the two countries, Chinese local media reported. China's foreign ministry spokesperson says they have ""lodged representations"" with North Korea, briefly acknowledging the incident without giving any further details. ""China's Public Security Department is now processing the case in accordance with the law,"" said Hua Chunying, spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a Monday press conference. South Korean news agency Yonhap cited an anonymous source, saying Chinese authorities have detained the man suspected of the alleged killings. There have been previous reports of runaway North Korean soldiers and citizens attempting robbery in search of food. A restaurant owner who lives in Dandong, another city bordering North Korea, recalled a harrowing incident in early 2013. ""One night, I heard a dog barking outside, so I got up to check what was going on. In the dim lighting, I saw a man dressed like a North Korean soldier stealing things from my restaurant,"" the unnamed owner was quoted in The Global Times. ""I yelled at him and he held up his gun as if he was ready to shoot. I was terrified and ran back to my room. He stole some meat and fled by speedboat."" In most cases, intruding soldiers were after food, and do not have the intention to harm people, making it rare that such violent cases would occur, reported the Chinese state-run newspaper. Thousands of North Koreans have tried to flee the country in hopes to escape the totalitarian regime. However, China has a uniform policy for sending defectors back to North Korea, ruling them as ""illegal economic migrants.""

"Cape Canaveral, Florida (CNN) -- President Obama pledged his full commitment to the space program Thursday, outlining a new strategy that ends current programs while funding new initiatives intended to propel humankind farther into the solar system. In a speech at the Kennedy Space Center, Obama outlined his proposal to pump an additional $6 billion into NASA's budget over the next five years while halting a project to resume lunar missions. The new spending would be for research on a propulsion breakthrough to travel deeper into space, as well as development of technologies to allow humans to transport necessary supplies to work and stay longer, Obama said. ""I am 100 percent committed to the mission of NASA and its future,"" Obama said to applause from the audience of space program workers. He outlined a program including a multibillion-dollar modernization of Kennedy Space Center, expansion of private-sector and commercial space industries, creation of thousands of jobs and eventually human travel to Mars. ""We will actually reach space faster and more often under this plan,"" Obama said, adding it would send more astronauts into space over the next decade than previously planned. ""By the mid-2030s I believe we can send people to orbit Mars and bring them safely back to Earth,"" Obama said. Landing on Mars will follow, and ""I expect to be around to see it,"" he said. Instead of being scrapped as originally proposed, the Orion crew capsule would be used as an emergency vehicle to reach crews at the International Space Station, Obama said. Obama noted that the Constellation Program, which had sought to send astronauts back to the moon by 2020, is behind schedule, over budget and overall less important than other space investments. The administration would instead invest in deep space exploration and scientific development, he said. ""We've been there before,"" Obama said of the moon. ""There's a lot more of space to explore and a lot more to learn when we do."" The proposal, which has not yet been approved by Congress, troubles some lawmakers from states where space centers are located. A shift in priorities means jobs are at stake. The main space centers in the United States are Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida; Marshall Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama; and Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. In an attempt to address such concerns, Obama announced a $40 million initiative to promote regional development and job creation. Allard Beutel, news chief at the Kennedy Space Center, told CNN that layoffs there will likely reach the 7,000 range with the end of NASA's space shuttle fleet and the cancellation of the Constellation program. Obama noted that the space shuttle fleet is scheduled to be retired at the end of this year under a decision made six years ago. That will leave the Russian Soyuz capsules as the only avenue into space until commercial ventures are ready to do the job, expected to be years away. The new strategy reflects a new era of international cooperation on space travel, Obama said, also noting that NASA always has collaborated with private companies on building space vehicles and other work. Leroy Chiao, a former astronaut and the current vice president of Excalibur Almaz, a private manned space flight company, said it's time to ""give the commercial guys a chance."" ""NASA's job really should be to focus on pushing outside of low-earth orbit, of either going to explore near-earth asteroids, going back to the moon to test architecture and modules and hardware, operations for an eventual visit to Mars. So, NASA really should be thinking farther,"" Chiao said, adding that private companies could serve as a ""taxi service"" for NASA. Some well-known astronauts from the Apollo program, which sent U.S. astronauts to the moon's surface from 1969 to 1972, criticized Obama's plan Wednesday, saying in a letter that ""the USA is far too likely to be on a long downhill slide to mediocrity."" ""America must decide if it wishes to remain a leader in space,"" the letter said. ""If it does, we should institute a program which will give us the very best chance of achieving that goal."" The letter was signed by the first and last men to walk on the moon -- Neil Armstrong from Apollo 11 and Eugene Cernan from Apollo 17 -- and James Lovell, who commanded the heroic Apollo 13 flight. They praised Obama's increase in total funding for space exploration, which includes money for research, the international space station and a heavy-lift rocket. However, the astronauts said the decision to cancel the Constellation program for manned space flight ""is devastating."" Armstrong's crewmate, Buzz Aldrin, supported Obama, saying NASA needs to explore new frontiers, not retrace 40-year-old footsteps. Aldrin rode on Air Force One with Obama to Cape Canaveral, but the president said Aldrin didn't seem too impressed by a plane unable to reach low-earth orbit. CNN's Ed Henry and Kristi Keck contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama outlines his proposal to pump an additional $6 billion into NASA's budget .

"Fears for the fate of more than 200 Nigerian girls turned even more nightmarish Monday when the leader of the Islamist militant group that kidnapped them announced plans to sell them. ""I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah,"" a man claiming to be Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said in a video first obtained by Agence France-Presse. ""There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women. I sell women,"" he continued, according to a CNN translation from the local Hausa language. Boko Haram is a terrorist group receiving training from al Qaeda affiliates, according to U.S. officials. Its name means ""Western education is sin.""  In his nearly hourlong, rambling video, Shekau repeatedly called for Western education to end. ""Girls, you should go and get married,"" he said. The outrageous threat means the girls' parents' worst fears could be realized. Parents have avoided speaking to the media for fear their daughters may be singled out for reprisals. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the video ""does appear legitimate."" The tape won't intimidate or deter Nigeria from efforts to save the kidnapped girls, the Nigerian government said. ""It is disheartening that someone would make such a terrible boast,"" Doyin Okupe, spokesman for President Goodluck Jonathan, said in an interview with CNN. ""It is to be expected of terrorists,"" he added.  ""No group can affect our resolve.  We will see this through to the end. We have the commitment and capacity to get this done. No matter what this takes, we will get these girls."" On Sunday, Jonathan vowed, ""Wherever these girls are, we'll get them out."" But he also criticized the girls' parents, saying they weren't cooperating fully with police. ""What we request is maximum cooperation from the guardians and the parents of these girls. Because up to this time, they have not been able to come clearly, to give the police clear identity of the girls that have yet to return,"" he said. Nigeria's finance minister responds to criticism . Weeks after the girls' April 14 kidnapping, Africa's most populous country seems to be no closer to finding them, triggering complaints of ineptitude -- some of which are expressed on Twitter with the globally trending hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. Nigeria's finance minister said Monday that her country's government remains committed to finding the girls, but should have done a better job explaining the situation to the public. ""Have we communicated what is being done properly? The answer is no, that people did not have enough information,"" Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told CNN's Richard Quest. Revealing details about the investigation is tricky, she said, ""because you are dealing with people that you don't know, and you don't know...what they might do to these girls."" On Sunday, about 100 demonstrators gathered outside the Nigerian High Commission in London, chanting, ""Bring them back!"" and ""Not for sale!"" Crowds from Los Angeles to London rallied Saturday as well. ""We need to take ownership as if this happened in Chicago or this happened in Washington, D.C. We need to be talking about this,"" Nicole Lee, outgoing president of the TransAfrica Forum, told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" ""I think people are doing that. It's catching fire."" Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed in on Twitter over the weekend. ""Access to education is a basic right & an unconscionable reason to target innocent girls,"" she wrote Sunday.  ""We must stand up to terrorism. #BringBackOurGirls."" Militants attacked school last month . According to accounts, armed members of Boko Haram overwhelmed security guards at a school last month, pulled the girls out of bed and forced them into trucks. The convoy of trucks then disappeared into the dense forest bordering Cameroon. On Friday, Nigerian authorities updated the number of girls kidnapped to 276. At least 53 of the girls escaped, leaving 223 in the hands of their captors, police said. Authorities said the number of missing girls could grow as police fill in spotty school enrollment records. Families had sent their girls to the rural school in Chibok for a desperately needed education. The northeastern town is part of Borno state, where 72% of primary-age children never attended school, according to the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria. It's even worse for girls than boys. ""In the North particularly, the gender gap remains particularly wide and the proportion of girls to boys in school ranges from 1 girl to 2 boys to 1 to 3 in some states,"" UNICEF says. Twelve northern states follow Sharia law. In recent years, Boko Haram has carried out dozens of attacks, killing thousands of people at schools, churches, police stations, government buildings and elsewhere. Targets include Christians, senior Islamic figures critical of Boko Haram and people the group believes are engaged in ""un-Islamic"" behavior, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom says. Boko Haram has gained training in weapons and communications from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in recent years. This helped it move from little-noticed attacks to more spectacular ones, including against Western targets and the Nigerian government, which it seeks to overthrow, U.S. authorities say.  In 2011, it carried out an attack with IEDs on the United Nations headquarters in Abuja. It's unclear just how big the group is. The U.S. State Department says Boko Haram's membership estimates ""range from the hundreds to a few thousand.""  A U.S. government report in December 2011 found that a ""consistent lack of reliable reporting on Boko Haram has contributed to the difficulty in assessing its size, makeup, and goals."" Crisis unfolds as Nigeria hosts World Economic Forum . Though Nigeria has Africa's largest economy, driven largely by oil, poverty remains widespread: Nearly 62% of the country's nearly 170 million people live in extreme poverty, according to the CIA World Factbook. That dichotomy takes center stage this week as a World Economic Forum meeting convenes Wednesday in Nigeria's capital of Abuja. The country ""already plays a crucial role in advancing the continent's growth; yet it is also emblematic of the challenges of converting natural wealth into solutions that address persistent social challenges,"" the World Economic Forum on Africa says on its website. Okonjo-Iweala, the finance minister, told CNN that Nigeria's intense efforts to find the girls have nothing to do with the high-profile event. ""We are doing things because we are Nigerians, and we have to solve our own problems. These are our daughters. It's like it's my daughter missing. Every single one of those girls is my daughter,"" Okonjo-Iweala said. ""I wake up in the morning depressed when I know that they have not been brought back home. The President wakes up depressed, because he came from a poor family, and without education he would never been where he is today."" Nigerian authorities, she said, are doing everything possible to find the girls -- and they're asking for help. ""Any international organization, any country that has different technology, ways of detecting, please let them help us to get these girls back,"" she said. The United States is sharing intelligence with Nigeria to help in the search, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the situation. ""We are sharing intelligence that may be relevant to this situation. You are going to see a focus on this in all three channels of government: diplomatic, intelligence and military,"" the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the information. Police vs. protesters? Police in Abuja denied having arrested a leader of a protest over the weekend that was critical of the Nigerian government's efforts. In a statement, police said they ""invited"" Nyadar Naomi Mutah, a native of Chibok, for a ""fact-finding interview."" She cooperated and ""was immediately allowed to return home to her loved ones,"" police said. But Aminu Mahmoud, a lawyer representing Mutah, said her client was arrested Sunday without charge. Fellow protest organizer Hadiza Usman said that during a session called by first lady Patience Jonathan to meet with protesters, the first lady recognized Mutah and said ""let's keep you aside for now."" It was not clear whether that had anything to do with Mutah's later going to the police station. In its statement on the matter, Abuja police also said security agencies ""are leaving no stone unturned"" in an attempt to ensure that the children are rescued.","Nigerian finance minister: Government did not communicate ""properly""

"(CNN)Ridiculously cold weather is gripping much of the country, and it's going to get worse before it gets better. In Chicago, the high temperature Wednesday will be 1 degree Fahrenheit. Yes, that's the high. And the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa will endure wind chills as low as 40 degrees below zero over the next two days. Even much of the South will be in a deep freeze by Wednesday morning. And folks from Ohio to Maryland can expect 3 to 7 inches of snow Tuesday. As of 12:30 p.m., 150 flights -- most heading to the East Coast -- were canceled at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, and passengers at Chicago Midway International Airport were experiencing 20-minute delays and a dozen cancellations, transportation officials said. Affected by winter weather? Share your images with CNN iReport . But not everyone is suffering. In fact, the brutal weather can be a financial boon. Here's a look at some of the businesses whose sales grow hot when the days get cold: . Hardware and grocery stores . Some Iowa residents are stocking up on supplies, boosting the bottom lines of area hardware and grocery stores. ""They're preparing and planning ahead, which is really good so they don't have to drive out in the streets,"" Mark Hayman, owner of Hayman's West Side Ace Hardware, told CNN affiliate KWQC. He said that sales of snow shovels and salt have doubled and that his staff is ready for the week. ""We have a lot of shovels and salt that we keep in stock year-round,"" Hayman told the affiliate. ""We store them in the warehouse and make sure we don't run out."" North Scott Foods, in Eldridge, is similarly stocked up and ready. A delivery truck that normally arrives Tuesday came earlier this week, ahead of the expected drop in temperature. ""They wanted to make sure the roads were good. We told them, 'good, come a day early; we'll need it,' "" assistant manager Jim Speirs told KWQC. Food deliveries . For those who don't stock up in time, never fear. Another type of business that sees its phones ring off the hook when the temperature drops is those specializing in deliveries. Who wants to go out on a cold day and brave the roads when there are others willing to deliver what you need? Malisha Spencer, manager at Indy All Night, which offers food delivery in Indianapolis nearly 24 hours a day, says business nearly doubles when a heavy cold front comes through. Daytime food delivery orders increase the most, she said. ""Most of our deliveries usually come at night, but when it gets colder, we get them all throughout the day,"" Spencer said. Salt sellers . Salt: It's not just for your grandma's bland casserole. Salt for highway deicing makes up 41% of total salt sales in the U.S. So you can imagine that salt sellers aren't as bummed out about the cold as regular Joes. During the snowstorms last year, Minnesota-based Cargill Inc. told The Wall Street Journal that the demand for deicing salt was ""simply unprecedented in recent memory."" Auto repair shops . Icy roads mean a big boost in business for auto repair shops. The cold makes cars more susceptible to damage. For example, a bumper that bends or dents in the summer can shatter in the winter, Brad Hamilton, manager of the Collision Center of Dayton, told CNN affiliate WDTN during last year's cold spell. Plumbers . There are lots of things homeowners can do to help avoid frozen pipes when temperatures drop. Michael Dunn, owner of M.T. Dunn Plumbing -- which services the Portland, Oregon, area -- lists some tips on his website. You can leave water dripping slowly from faucets, for example. Or set your home's thermostat above 55 degrees. But even the best-laid plans can be no match for Mother Nature, which is where plumbers such as Dunn can step in. ""It rarely gets that cold here, but when it does, it gets very hectic,"" he said. During a particularly bitter cold snap last year, Dunn remembers getting 227 calls in one night. ""It was a record,"" he said. ""It filled up my mailbox."" Winter gear makers . The Original Muck Boot Company in Rhode Island counts on the fall and winter for 70% of its sales. And it's not the only one. Brooklyn-based Pawz, which makes bright-colored rubber boots for dogs, also see sales peak in the winter. ""It's seems odd to say this, but the nasty, cold, slushy weather is core to our business. We welcome it,"" Sean O'Brien, global director of retail footwear, told CNN Money. CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri contributed to this report.","Wind chills in the upper Midwest will drop as low as 40 degrees below zero .

"Surabaya, Indonesia (CNN)AirAsia officials didn't pick up weather reports ahead of Flight QZ8501's crash in person -- something that doesn't mean the airline violated any policies but could mean it missed an opportunity for meteorologists to detail potentially dangerous conditions face-to-face, Indonesia's official weather service told CNN. Yunus Subagyo Swarinoto, deputy director for meteorology at the weather agency BMKG, said, ""Based on our records, there was no AirAsia flight operation officer that directly collected the flight document."" This practice appears to be common for AirAsia, according to BMKG Station Chief Blucher Doloksaribu. CNN did not see AirAsia listed in entries for a logbook running from December 31 to January 6, for instance. The airline doesn't dispute this, explaining it gets and distributes the same information not in person but by email. The documents are printed and brought onto the flight for pilots to see, AirAsia's Indonesia President Director Sunu Widyatmoko told CNN. One advantage of picking up such documents personally -- which in Surabaya, where Flight QZ8501 took off from December 28, would be done at the Airport Authority building -- is that it gives cockpit crew or airline operations staff a chance to review it with the meteorologist on duty, ask questions and get additional information, said BMKG forecaster Apritarum Fadianika. But AirAsia argues that the official copy actually isn't as easy to read as the electronic version, which has the same information and comes in color. ""Our dispatch mirror the dispatch practices of numerous airlines globally,"" AirAsia said in a statement. There's been no apparent change in how the airline gets copies of weather information since QZ8501 went down in the Java Sea. But there's now a change in how its staff process it: Whereas pilots briefed themselves before the crash, there's now a face-to-face briefing involving pilots and flights operations officers before each flight, AirAsia spokeswoman Audrey Petriny said. • Hayati Lutfiah Hamid . • Grayson Herbert Linaksita . • Kevin Alexander Soetjipto . • The Meiji Thejakusuma . • Hendra Gunawan Syawal . • Khairunisa Haidar Fauzi . • Jie Stevie Gunawan . • Juanita Limantara . • Wismoyo Ari Prambudi . • Tony Linaksita . • Shiane Josal . • Lim Yan Koen . • Yongki Jou . • Indra Yulianto . • Hindarto Halim . • Jou Brian Youvito . Suspension of flight route . AirAsia's handling of weather information is being investigated by Indonesia's transportation ministry, a top Indonesian aviation official told CNN on Monday. It's not the only thing. The airline's practices have already come under scrutiny, including the fact AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate didn't have a license to fly the Surabaya-to-Singapore route on the day that the plane disappeared, according to authorities. The airline was approved to fly the route four days a week but that did not include Sunday, Indonesia's Ministry of Transport said as it announced a full investigation and suspended AirAsia Indonesia flights between the two cities. AirAsia Indonesia has said it will cooperate fully with the investigation and would not be releasing any statement until the results were known, local media reported. But aviation authorities in Singapore said there was no issue on their end. The Singapore Civil Aviation Authority said it had given AirAsia permission to fly the Surabaya-to-Singapore route daily through March 28. It added that AirAsia was operating the flight four days a week, including Sundays, but that ""airlines may adjust their flight frequencies in the course of a season in response to market demand or operational requirements."" Officials reassigned . Two officials in the Surabaya airport's operations department have been reassigned, said the president director of the state-owned company that manages 13 airports in central and eastern Indonesia. Tommy Soetomo said a department head and a section head were transferred Monday at the order of the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of State Owned Operations, pending an investigation. Visibility an issue for searchers . Meanwhile, the search continues for wreckage and bodies from the Singapore-bound flight, which went down with 162 people board after its crew lost contact with air traffic controllers. The cause of the disaster is still under investigation. Big waves and visibility have been problems for searchers, according to officials. So far, 39 bodies have been found, and 16 of those have been identified publicly. Three others have been identified, but officials still needed to inform their families. The aerial search began again Wednesday morning just after dawn. The Indonesian Navy has sent special equipment to try to tackle the muddy conditions, Indonesian military chief Gen. Moeldoko said Monday. U.S. Navy divers assisting in the search have already been using side-scan sonar gear, which is designed to map the sea floor and capture accurate images for analysis. When they find submerged wreckage, divers could also face challenges like ""jagged edges, torn fuselage, things hanging all over the place,"" said Geno Gargiulo, an experienced commercial diver in the United States. ""It's going to be dark inside -- a lot of things for a diver to get snagged on, for its umbilical to get caught up on, to get disoriented,"" said Gargiulo, who says he's helped in the aftermath of recent catastrophes, including the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Highlighting the complexity of the challenge, Moeldoko said Monday that one large piece of wreckage initially believed to be part of the aircraft turned out to actually be from a ship. Objects obscured by waves . The ships and aircraft looking for remains from Flight QZ8501 have so far detected several large pieces of wreckage believed to be from the commercial jet, according to Indonesian officials. But they still haven't located the main body of the plane and the all-important flight recorders. A locator beacon in at least one of the plane's so-called black boxes was manufactured by Dukane Seacom, the same company that built the beacons on the still-missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. But the search for the AirAsia flight is markedly different than the hunt for the missing Malaysian airliner, since wreckage has already been found. Records show there are fresh batteries in at least one of the AirAsia plane's beacons, which are designed to send out pinging sounds for 30 days after a crash to help searchers find the black boxes, Dukane Seacom President Anish Patel said. Some of the bodies found over the weekend were still wearing seat-belts, search officials said. The bad weather conditions brought about by Indonesia's monsoon -- including strong winds, thick clouds, heavy rain and big waves -- have hindered the teams' efforts during nine days of searching. ""As soon as you see something in the distance, it disappears behind a wave -- and then it's very difficult to try and spot it again,"" said CNN's Paula Hancocks, who spent 15 hours out on a search vessel Sunday. How can a modern airliner vanish? David Molko reported from Surabaya, Indonesia. Josh Gaynor and Intan Hadidjah reported from Jakarta. CNN's Steve Almasy, Greg Botelho and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","Two officials at Surabaya's airport reassigned, pending investigation .

"New York (CNN)A pair of New York police officers shot and wounded while responding to an armed robbery in the Bronx were going off-duty and probably not wearing their bulletproof vests, police officials said Tuesday. In fact, Andrew Dossi, Aliro Pellerano and three other officers were changing clothes at the end of a dangerous anti-crime detail when they ran out of a Bronx station house to search for two robbery suspects, officials said. The suspects were arrested Tuesday. ""Chances are they weren't wearing their vests,"" Chief of Department James O'Neill told reporters. ""They were going home. They jumped into a car and they ended up getting into this fierce firefight."" The alleged shooter was identified as Jason Polanco, a 24-year-old boxer who was charged with five counts of attempted murder of a police officer and was said to have posted anti-police and anti-government statements on social media, police said. His alleged accomplice, Joshua Kemp, 28, was arrested on robbery charges. The wounded officers spent Tuesday at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. One of them, Dossi, who is 30 and has eight years on the job, was in stable condition following surgery after being shot in the arm and lower back, according to police. The other, Pellerano, who is 38 and has nine years as an officer, is in stable condition with gunshot wounds to the chest and arm. ""Last night a team of our officers displayed extraordinary bravery, going above and beyond the call to protect their fellow New Yorkers,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has found himself at odds with some in his police force in recent weeks, said in a statement Tuesday.  ""We thank these officers for their commitment to serving our city, including answering the call after their shift had ended. ... This incident was yet another reminder of how profoundly important the work of our police officers is, as well as the seriousness of the dangers they face every day in the line of duty."" De Blasio also thanked New Yorkers who provided more than two dozen tips that helped identify the gunman.  Police said 10 of the tipsters identified Polanco by name. Monday night, authorities located the white Camaro that two suspects carjacked a block from the shooting, as well as a .44-caliber revolver, but no one was inside the vehicle. Before Polanco was arrested, police offered a $12,000 reward for information leading to a bearded man pictured in a surveillance video from inside a take-out Chinese restaurant moments before the shooting. Police said he was the man who shot at the officers. Polanco entered the restaurant and bought a bottle of iced tea before coming out firing at the officers who stopped his alleged accomplice outside, police said. 'Extraordinarily brave' The call about an armed robbery at a Bronx grocery store came in around 10:30 p.m. Monday, as five plainclothes officers were coming off their shift. Rather than going home, the police went to look for the criminals, something de Blasio described as ""extraordinarily brave and ... part of their commitment."" The officers exchanged gunfire with Polanco, police said, but the suspects got away, fleeing on foot for one block and then carjacking the Camaro. At tense time for police in city . Sometime after the shooting, Kemp checked himself into a Manhattan hospital with a gunshot wound to the back, officials said. The man who drove him to the hospital was also taken into custody. Kemp, who has been arrested multiple times for robbery and was on parole, gave an account of how he was shot that didn't add up, police said. ""He told a story that didn't seem factual, to be honest with you,"" Robert Boyce, chief of detectives, told reporters. ""He was not credible. ... So, quickly the story didn't add up and then we saw his background, that he was a Bronx guy and we started breaking the case."" The incident happened just south of Fordham University, an area hardly unfamiliar to violent crime. John Cardillo, who patrolled the area when he was a police officer, called it ""a rough neighborhood in the '90s, and it still is today... (It had and has) armed bad guys with the propensity to shoot someone."" The shootings have gotten heightened attention given when they happened -- at a time of large-scale anti-police protests after a grand jury decided not to indict a white New York police officer in the death of Eric Garner, an African-American man. Even if it's too early to tie it to this incident, experts in the law enforcement community have expressed concerns that such sentiment -- views supported in some respects, according to some police, by de Blasio -- will encourage violence against police. That's what happened, they say, when Ismaaiyl Brinsley fatally ambushed NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu last month as they sat in their patrol car. ""When the rhetoric turns anti-police, the police are concerned that people on the street, it's going to increase the already existent lack of respect in certain segments of the society -- including armed robbers ... and other violent criminals,"" said CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director. De Blasio has become a focal point for supporters of law enforcement, with some police even turning their backs on him at Ramos' and Liu's funerals because of their perception that he has been overly supportive of protesters and critical of police. ""The relationship is toxic (and) almost irretrievable in some respects,"" CNN political commentator Errol Louis said of the mayor-police dynamic. ""This is not a good atmosphere."" On Tuesday, Patrick Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, who has accused de Blasio of having ""blood on his hands"" after the two officers were killed in December, said in a statement: ""New York City police officers, who could have closed their lockers and gone home after their shift ended, chose to respond to a robbery in progress and, sadly, were shot in the process. Our members are out there doing their jobs and putting themselves in danger to keep this city safe just as they always do.""

"Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- not Hillary Clinton -- is the top progressive choice for president in 2016, according to a new poll. In fact, Clinton doesn't even make second place. Forty two percent of respondents favor Warren, and Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders also edges out Clinton with 24% compared to her 23%, according to results from the 2016 Presidential Pulse Poll commissioned by progressive grassroots organization Democracy for America. These results come amid a groundswell of activism from the Democratic party's more liberal wing, which has called for a contested 2016 primary and has often questioned Clinton's financial ties to Wall Street. ""Elizabeth Warren won by a large margin because she inspires Democrats by valiantly fighting for populist progressive policies to address income inequality in the face of Wall Street resistance -- and because she regularly engages with the grassroots base of her party,"" said Charles Chamberlain, the group's executive director, in a release of the poll. He noted, however, that the poll's biggest finding is not that support for Warren among liberal voters is widespread, but that progressives want to make sure that the Democratic nomination process is a ""contest, not a coronation."" Vice President Joe Biden, rumored to be considering a third presidential bid, was selected by 2% of those polled. Clinton, a far-and-away frontrunner in most other polls of mainstream Democrats and American voters, is widely expected to launch a presidential bid. Whether Warren or Sanders will throw their hats in the ring is not as clear. Warren repeatedly told CNN's Gloria Borger in an interview that she has no intention of running for president. But as her clout as a progressive firebrand has grown, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid appointed her to his leadership team, a move party leaders hope will bring more left-leaning voters into the fold and increase the party's chances of winning back Senate seats in 2016. Democracy for America -- founded by former Vermont governor and former presidential candidate Howard Dean -- now boasts one million members, with nearly 165 thousand total votes cast in this poll. Since the group's founding in 2004, members have raised more than $32.7 million to support progressive candidates. Participants, surveyed between Nov. 6 and Nov. 18, were permitted to select and rank up to three total candidates they'd like to see run in 2016.","A new poll of progressives gives Sen.

"(CNN)As always, the Internet has jokes. ""Who is Paul McCartney?"" trended on Twitter this week thanks to Kanye West's collaboration with the former Beatle, ""Only One."" Apparently people were pleased that the rapper was helping shine a spotlight on a new talent. Really? Many of said tweeters have since said they were just joshing, but we see your fooleywang, people of social media, and we raise the stakes. West isn't the first to try to make this McCartney guy famous. Here are some other folks who tried to boost the fortunes of this obscure Liverpudlian. Michael Jackson . McCartney really got a boost from the superstar when the pair released ""The Girl Is Mine"" in 1982 and followed up with the single ""Say, Say, Say"" -- which hit No. 1 -- the following year. The King of Pop clearly had a soft spot for the up-and-comer, as he also purchased the rights to the Beatles catalog of music. Apparently, this McCartney fellow is a noted songwriter, too! Tracey Ullman . Ullman did her fellow countryman a solid by giving him a cameo in the 1983 music video for her single ""They Don't Know."" She went on to become pretty famous as a comedic actress. Stevie Wonder . Leave it to a legend like Wonder to help an aspiring artist. McCartney wrote this one solo, and Wonder hopped on the track in 1982. The song spent  a few weeks at the top of the pop charts. Why it  didn't put Macca on the map, well, who knows? Dave Grohl . The rocker attempted to show McCartney how it's done when they worked together on ""Cut Me Some Slack,"" which appeared on the soundtrack for Grohl's 2013 documentary ""Sound City."" The pair jammed with Pat Smear on guitar and Krist Novoselic on bass as Nirvana, one of the leading bands of the '90s, tried hard to raise McCartney's visibility. John Lennon . Though this list is not exhaustive, it wouldn't be complete without a mention of the late John Lennon. Were it not for this partnership, the world wouldn't have such classics as ""A Day in the Life"" and ""I Want to Hold Your Hand."" They met as teens in the 1950s and later were integral members of a little group you may have heard of called the Beatles. That Paul McCartney might have legs yet in the music industry.","Ex-Beatle's song with Kanye West leads to jokes about ""Who is Paul McCartney?""

"(CNN)Cameron Diaz kicked off her new year with the sound of wedding bells. According to reports, the actress married Good Charlotte musician Benji Madden in a small ceremony at the couple's home in Los Angeles. Diaz, 42, had been dating Madden, 35, since May. The couple became engaged in December and are said to have sealed the deal the evening of January 5. The guest list reportedly included celebrities like Reese Witherspoon and Gwyneth Paltrow, with Diaz's friend Drew Barrymore serving as a bridesmaid. Diaz - who has previously been linked to actor Jared Leto, singer Justin Timberlake and baseball player Alex Rodriguez - has been skeptical in the past of marriage and outspoken about the fact that she wasn't anxious to settle down. She told Maxim magazine in 2011 that she believed marriage was a ""dying institution,"" adding, ""I think we have to make our own rules. I don't think we should live our lives in relationships based off old traditions that don't suit our world any longer."" But it seems Benji Madden suits the actress just fine. Diaz's friend and Madden's sister-in-law, Nicole Richie, has previously (and perhaps jokingly) taken credit for setting the pair up. ""I approve of anything that's going to make Benj happy,"" Richie, who's married to Madden's twin brother, Joel, told Andy Cohen on ""Watch What Happens Live"" in July. ""I am a devoted sister-in-law. I am happy for anybody who's happy, and I want everybody to be surrounded with love."" If Richie did play matchmaker for Diaz and Madden, she nailed it. In a statement to People magazine the newlyweds said, ""We couldn't be happier to begin our new journey together surrounded by our closest family and friends.""","Cameron Diaz married musician Benji Madden Monday .

"Nearly 700 people have been killed in nine days of fierce clashes between an al Qaeda affiliate and other Islamist and rebel groups, activists said Sunday. Forces from the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have increasingly come into conflict with Free Syrian Army fighters and other hard-line factions opposing the Syrian regime, while ISIS attempts to impose its strict form of Islamic Sharia law on areas coming under its control in northern Syria. In the last nine days, 697 people have been killed in the fighting, activists said. The victims include 351 combatants from the Islamist and non-Islamist rebel battalions, 246 ISIS fighters, and 100 civilians, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The activist group said the deaths took place between January 3 and January 12. Among the 100 civilians killed in the clashes, 21 were executed by ISIS in the children's hospital in Qadi Askar in the northern rebel stronghold of Aleppo, the group said. CNN cannot independently verify daily death tolls, but the United Nations has said more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since 2011. Foreign ministers meet . The violence came as the ""Friends of Syria"" group of foreign ministers, including U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, convened in Paris on Sunday in a last-ditch attempt to persuade the Syrian opposition to attend a peace conference in Geneva, Switzerland, at the end of January. The Western-backed rebels are deeply divided on whether to go and will announce a decision on January 17. ""There is no military solution to the violence,"" Kerry said Sunday about a proposed new round of peace talks. ""There is no other alternative to saving the nation of Syria than negotiations."" Kerry said he has ""no expectations"" about the success of the so-called Geneva II talks, but that the sides need to enter the meetings with the goal of ""waging an even stronger effort to provide for this political solution."" ""I am confident the Syrian opposition will come to Geneva,"" Kerry said. Kerry added that Russian leaders have assured him they'll attend. In a statement, the alliance of mainly Western and Gulf Arab countries called on armed groups to ""respect democratic and pluralistic values"" and allow humanitarian access. It condemned the presence of foreign fighters in Syria, ""both those fighting with the regime such as Hezbollah and other Iranian backed forces, and those fighting within other extremist groups,"" and demanded their immediate withdrawal. It urged democratic opposition forces to keep opposing groups affiliated with al Qaeda. ""We fully support the Supreme Military Council of the Free Syrian Army and other democratic opposition forces in their action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant,"" it said. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is another name for ISIS. Uneasy alliance . For months, the rebel groups maintained an uneasy alliance as they fought to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. But now, the infighting has threatened to tip the balance among rebel forces toward militant groups and away from more secular brigades. In a statement, the opposition Syrian Coalition media office condemned ""any and all violations"" and said armed gangs were taking advantage of the infighting between ISIS and the Free Syrian Army. The statement, signed by Syrian Coalition media office director Khalid Saleh, cited these as ""illegal practices, intimidating civilians, and theft, taking place all over Syria; particularly in the northern parts of the country."" ""We call on FSA brigades to work with civil revolutionary bodies and local councils operating in those areas to address the threat of those gangs, and make sure those gangsters are hunted down and brought to justice,"" the statement said. In Iraq, where at least nine people were killed and more than 40 wounded in several car explosions on Sunday, security forces in Mosul said they have detained 137 ISIS suspects in a series of raids in the city over the past seven days. U.N. official in Damascus . On a visit to Damascus on Sunday, the United Nations humanitarian chief expressed concern for communities cut off by the months of fighting between government and rebel forces. ""I am particularly worried about the reports of starvation,"" Valerie Amos said in a statement after meeting with government officials as well as humanitarian organizations. ""The world must do more for all the people who are displaced. Many families are living in abandoned buildings, schools or in makeshift shelters, without enough food, clean water or medicine. We must help them to get through this very cold winter,"" she said after visiting a shelter in rural Damascus. Amos recognized steps taken by the government to approve visas so aid can get in. ""But we need to do more in a crisis of this magnitude,"" she said.","Kerry says he's confident Syrian opposition will attend Paris talks .

"A former Reagan administration national security adviser is suspected of having illegally represented the government of Sudan, which has been under strict U.S. government sanctions and a trade embargo for nearly 20 years for supporting terrorism and violating human rights. FBI agents searched the Watergate apartment in Washington where Robert McFarlane resides seeking evidence of his alleged connection with Sudan. Court documents show agents seized handwritten notes, computer equipment and White House documents classified up to the level of Top Secret. McFarlane, who served as President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser from 1983 to 1985, has not been charged with any crime, and the U.S. attorney in Alexandria says McFarlane is working with authorities on the case. ""Mr. McFarlane is cooperating with this ongoing investigation and through his counsel has asserted his innocence,"" said the prosecutor's spokesman Peter Carr. McFarlane's attorney, Barry Levine, said his client ""is a patriot. He is a humanitarian. He cares mightily about Darfur. And he surely violated no laws."" The story was first reported in The Washington Post. The detailed FBI affidavit in support of the search reviewed the history of McFarlane's alleged relationship with Sudanese officials. The investigation is more than two years old, and discloses that agents went through trash at a location in Virginia looking for clues to McFarlane's relationship with Sudanese officials. The FBI said they had found a series of e-mails to McFarlane which agents believed to be from someone in the Sudanese intelligence service. After reviewing 2009 e-mails FBI agent Grayden Ridd said in his court document, ""I believe these e-mails are evidence that McFarlane was entering into an agreement with the Government of Sudan to lobby the U.S. government officials on behalf of Sudan and to provide it with advice during negotiations with the United States."" The agent further said it appeared McFarlane and his Sudanese contact intended to structure the deal so it would appear McFarlane was representing Qatar, a U.S. ally. McFarlane's Sudanese contact, according to the FBI, was a diplomat named Mohammed Hassen Babiker, whom the FBI said it learned was an intelligence operative for Sudan. Babiker, the FBI says, told McFarlane the three things he was interested in discussing with the U.S. government were peace in the war-torn Darfur region of western Sudan, existing U.S. sanctions against Sudan and its inclusion on the terror list, and the role of the United States in  fostering peace and unity in Sudan. Prosecutors had no information on any legal proceedings in the case, but acknowledged they would take place in the Eastern District of Virginia.","McFarlane ""surely violated no laws,"" his attorney says .

"A last-minute enrollment surge enabled the White House to meet its original sign-up target for the Affordable Care Act, a surprising victory for the Obama administration after a rocky rollout of the program that has become a political hot potato for Democrats and a rallying cry for Republicans. President Barack Obama said on Tuesday that 7.1 million people had signed up on federal or state exchanges for coverage under the health care law now often known as Obamacare. The enrollment period began anemically in October with a faltering federal website and ended with a crush of people trying to beat Monday's deadline to get coverage. Not everyone who has selected a health plan has paid for it yet, officials said. Nevertheless, Obama claimed victory at a White House ceremony, saying the program approved by Congress in 2010 -- with no Republican support and vilified relentlessly by the GOP as government overreach -- has been a force for good. He said it wasn't perfect, acknowledging the early difficulties in selecting a policy on HealthCare.gov, and he predicted more hurdles in carrying it out. But the overall goal of starting to narrow the gap between those with health coverage and those without it has begun, and millions of Americans are embracing it, Obama said. ""That's what the (law) is all about, making sure all of us and all our fellow citizens can count on the security of health care when we get sick,"" he said, noting that the ""law is doing what it's supposed to do. It's working."" The numbers . The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office originally projected the 7 million enrollment target for the October through March period, which was adopted by the administration. Expectations plummeted throughout the fall and into this year after the early website problems, which Obama called ""several lost weeks."" But signs of a pickup began in late January and continued into February and early March despite a fierce campaign by Republicans to demonize the law as unworkable. Administration officials said an absolute crush of people pushed the program -- Obama's chief domestic accomplishment -- over the finish line at the 11th hour. More than 4.8 million visits were made to HealthCare.gov on Monday alone. Officials stressed that the 7.1 million figure represents only those who signed up for coverage. Those who came in late and encountered technical problems have until mid-April to complete the process. Private insurers are providing the coverage. Health of Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told an Oklahoma TV station on Monday that insurers were reporting that 80% to 90% had paid so far. The law also includes expanded Medicaid insurance for the poor in many states, but those participants are not part of the sign-up total. The politics . Republicans, especially in the House, have waged a nonstop campaign to repeal or roll back the Affordable Care Act, saying it was rammed through Congress without their input and now is another illustration of big government at its worst. They have made it a rallying cry of their fall campaign to expand their majority in the House and reclaim the Senate. It has energized the base, and the issue informs the commentary of potential GOP candidates for president as well. Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said in a statement that the law ""continues to harm the American people"" despite Obama's ""victory lap."" He said costs are not going down, as Obama contends, and people are losing insurance plans they preferred and small businesses are chafing under the law's requirements. ""That's why we must replace this fundamentally flawed law with patient-centered solutions that will actually lower health care costs and help create jobs,"" Steel said. Democrats on the stump, especially those who voted for it and now find themselves in tight races, have recalibrated their position with Obama's presidency not much help to them with voters overall in their states. But Obama said at the White House that the law is good for the country, regardless of politics, and that the numbers show Americans want it and that it's ""here to stay."" ""I don't get it. Why are folks working so hard for people not to have health insurance? Why are they so mad about the idea of people having health insurance?"" he asked. What people think . Americans are divided over how they view the law. Last month, 46% said they viewed it unfavorably, down 4 points since January, and 38% said they viewed it favorably, up 4 points over the same time period, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll. Those who held unfavorable views cited concerns about costs (23%), opposition to the individual mandate (17%), and concerns about government intrusion (10%). Those with favorable views cited expanded access to health care and health insurance (61%), followed by the perception that it will control health care costs and make it more affordable (10%) and that it will be good for the country (7%). The telephone survey of 1,504 adults was conducted March 11 to 17 and had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 points. Professor Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said he was not surprised at the last-minute rush to sign up. ""I think the prayer of the conservatives that this would collapse just didn't get answered,"" he told CNN. ""It fills a need."" He predicted conservatives would chip away at whatever the number proves to be. ""It's all just, some people hate Obama and anything he does,"" he said. The details . The administration did not release details about the numbers, including the number of younger Americans who signed up. That metric is crucial for making the program work economically because premiums from younger, healthier participants are needed to make the program work for older people who use the health care system more. An official briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity said insurance companies were confident the percentage of young people was sufficient for the insurance marketplaces to function properly. Obamacare's primary goal is to reduce the ranks of the 45 million uninsured. Until now, many Americans with pre-existing conditions had to pay sky-high prices for insurance, if they could get any at all. Often, insurers branded them ""uninsurable."" The surge . The administration pulled out all the stops in the final weeks of the enrollment period -- an effort one official equated to a ""get out the vote"" campaign before an election. Administration officials took to the radio airwaves by participating in 400 interviews, enlisted celebrities and athletes to promote the law, and engaged people on social media. And Obama's interview on the online comedycast ""Between Two Ferns"" resulted in the so-called Zach Galifianakis effect, resulting in 33 million views of his mock interview with the comedian. The interview with Galifianakis, along with a promotional push from Miami Heat forward LeBron James, were cited by administration officials as two of the most effective components in the push to enroll young Americans on the health care exchanges. The overall effort, the White House said, surpassed their expectations in terms of last-minute sign-ups. By the numbers: The final Obamacare push .

"Meriam Yehya Ibrahim faces a death sentence in Sudan for apostasy after a court ruled she converted from Islam. Now the 27-year-old Christian woman, a wife and mother expecting another child, embarks on a long and unpredictable legal journey. A variety of factors -- Sudan's legal system, differences between its constitution and Sharia law imposed by the sentencing judge, her pregnancy -- ensure there will no execution any time soon. Ibrahim's lawyer argues the sentence should not stand, and an international outcry could pressure Sudan's government to intervene. Even if the sentence stands, Sharia law as practiced in Sudan prohibits carrying out the death sentence on an expectant woman until two years after she gives birth. Here are some questions and answers on what happens now: . What is this all about? On Thursday, a Khartoum court convicted Ibrahim of apostasy, or the renunciation of faith, and sentenced her to death. Ibrahim was born to a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox mother. Her father left when she was 6, and she was raised by her mother as a Christian. Her lawyer, Mohamed Jar Elnabi, said the case started after Ibrahim's brother filed a complaint against her. The brother alleged Ibrahim had gone missing for several years and that her family was shocked to find she had married a Christian man. Because her father was Muslim, the Sharia law court considered her to be the same. It refused to recognize her marriage to a Christian and also convicted her of adultery, with an additional sentence of 100 lashes. Before imposing the sentence, the court gave her an opportunity to recant her Christian faith, but Elnabi said Ibrahim refused to do so, declaring: ""I am a Christian, and I will remain a Christian."" Attempts by CNN to contact Sudan's justice minister and foreign affairs minister about the case were unsuccessful. Can she appeal? Elnabi told CNN on Friday that he plans to ask an appeals court to review the sentence, and could file the request as soon as Sunday. That will begin a legal process in which the case works its way through Sudan's Supreme Court and up to the Constitutional Court, the nation's highest, he said. There was no definite timetable for the appeal process, according to Elnabi, who said any death sentence must be ratified by both the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court. What is the basis of the appeal? Elnabi argues that Sudan's constitution allows religious conversion without restriction. ""I am very much optimistic that the appeal court will reverse the death sentence issued by the primary court,"" he said. Katherine Perks of the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies agreed. She said the verdict goes against Sudan's ""own constitution and commitments made under regional and international law."" However, Sudan has a history of religious discrimination. Under President Omar al-Bashir, the African nation ""continues to engage in systematic, ongoing and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief,"" the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said in its 2014 report. The country imposes Sharia law on Muslims and non-Muslims alike and punishes acts of ""indecency"" and ""immorality"" by floggings and amputations, the commission said. ""Conversion from Islam is a crime punishable by death, suspected converts to Christianity face societal pressures, and government security personnel intimidate and sometimes torture those suspected of conversion,"" said the commission appointed by the U.S. Congress and president. Since 1999, the State Department has called Sudan one of the worst offenders of religious rights. Do her pregnancy and family situation make a difference? Ibrahim is eight months pregnant and has a 20-month-old son who stays with her in prison. Elnabi said her husband, Daniel Wani, uses a wheelchair and ""totally depends on her for all details of his life."" As practiced in Sudan, Sharia law prohibits the execution of pregnant women. Instead, the sentence is delayed until two years after lactation. In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, the Sudanese government waited until the mother weaned her child before carrying out the sentence, said Christian Solidarity Worldwide spokeswoman Kiri Kankhwende. According to Elnabi, Ibrahim is having a difficult pregnancy, but a request to send her to a private hospital was denied ""due to security measures."" Will international pressure make any difference? Human rights groups and Western governments are complaining about Ibrahim's case. ""We call upon the government of Sudan to respect the right to freedom of religion, including one's right to change one's faith or beliefs, a right which is enshrined in international human rights law as well as in Sudan's own 2005 Interim Constitution,"" said a statement by the embassies of the United States, Britain, Canada and the Netherlands. Amnesty International described Ibrahim as a prisoner of conscience. ""Adultery and apostasy are acts which should not be considered crimes at all, let alone meet the international standard of 'most serious crimes' in relation to the death penalty,"" said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher. ""It is a flagrant breach of international human rights law."" The case comes as the world focuses on more than 200 schoolgirls abducted by Islamic extremists in northern Nigeria who threaten to sell them into slavery. Whether Ibrahim's case will generate the same strong reaction as the Nigerian situation remains unclear. In the past, a forceful international outcry has influenced similar apostasy cases. In 2006, an Afghan man threatened with the death penalty for converting to Christianity was released into exile after Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai reportedly intervened at the behest of his Western backers, over the objections of the country's conservative judiciary.","Pregnant Christian woman sentenced to death for apostasy in Sudan .

"President Barack Obama canceled a campaign trip at the last minute to stay in Washington and spearhead a more aggressive national response after Ebola infected two nurses and frightened Americans with the prospect that their health system is not equipped to handle a catastrophic medical event. Obama said Wednesday that monitoring of Ebola must be done in a ""much more aggressive way."" He continued, according to the pool report, to say that as soon as someone is diagnosed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must have a rapid response team immediately on site. The White House is taking this very seriously at the highest levels. The President made the comments after a special meeting of his Cabinet that was convened to address Ebola and came as one of the infected nurses in Texas was transported to special hospital facilities in Georgia for care. Get up to speed on Ebola developments . Obama said the CDC would deploy new SWAT teams within 24 hours to any hospital with an infected patient. He also promised that the federal government would review contacts made by infected people before they showed symptoms. But he urged calm, repeating that Ebola is not easily spread if someone is not showing symptoms. ""Here's what we know about Ebola. It's not like the flu. It's not airborne,"" the President said, adding that he had met, hugged and even kissed health care workers at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta who had treated Ebola patients. The White House announced Wednesday that it was postponing Obama's campaign trip -- which included stops in Connecticut and New Jersey -- in order for the president to meet with ""Cabinet agencies coordinating the government's response to the Ebola outbreak."" With the potency of his last years in office on the line, Obama was expected to cautiously step back on to the campaign trail Wednesday, rallying Democrats in dyed-blue Connecticut working to keep the governor there in office. But the President still will continue to mostly avoid campaigning in Senate contests, sticking to the gubernatorial campaign trail in three visits over the next week and four more planned trips in the final week of the 2014 season. Only one of those trips -- in Michigan -- is set to involve Democrat's Senate nominee. Vulnerable candidates in places such as Kentucky, North Carolina, Arkansas and Louisiana have been loathe to invite Obama to rally for them in their own states, spooked by his low approval ratings and the unpopular policy initiatives they helped move through Congress. That's left Obama relegated to the role of chief fund-raiser, jetting to wealthy enclaves across the country to try and keep donors encouraged enough about Democrats' chances to keep writing checks. It's been a tough sell recently, with Republicans almost certain to retain control of the U.S. House and models giving the GOP an edge to take the Senate. White House: No Holder replacement until after midterms . In Connecticut, where Obama had been scheduled to speak Wednesday, Gov. Dannel Malloy is tied with Republican rival Tom Foley, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Ireland from 2006-2009. A CBS/New York Times poll had both men at 41% among likely voters in a survey taken the last week of September. A White House official had said earlier Obama would also campaign with two Democratic gubernatorial candidates on Sunday: Anthony Brown in Maryland and Pat Quinn in Illinois. Both have slight edges over their Republican rivals, and will depend on high turnout among African-Americans, one group with which Obama still has sway. Obama's midterm malaise . Connecticut and Maryland are both deep blue, swinging in Obama's direction by wide margins in both 2008 and 2012. In Connecticut, voters have been more willing to send Republicans to the State House -- when Malloy took office in 2011 he succeeded two GOP governors. And Obama will use the final week of the campaign season crisscrossing the country to boost gubernatorial candidates in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Maine and Michigan. White House aims to show Obama at work . In states with tight Senate races that are either Republican-leaning or true battlegrounds, Democrats have gone to sometimes extreme lengths to avoid Obama's drag. Alison Lundergan Grimes, challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, wouldn't even say whether she voted for Obama in the last election. The White House, while defending Obama's economic record, says issues such as Ebola and combating ISIS have occupied the bulk of his time. But they say he'll do what he can for Democrats ahead of November 4. ""The President obviously has got a few things on his plate these days, but (he) is looking forward to the opportunity to campaign with other candidates in advance of the midterms,"" press secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday.","Obama wants to see more aggressive approach .

"Hollywood  actors Cherie Johnson and Dennis White say they were improperly stopped by police, put in handcuffs and harshly questioned during a recent weekend getaway in South Carolina. They claim the incident took place because of their race. ""It hurts me more that telling the story, other people are not surprised,"" Johnson said in an interview on HLN's"" Showbiz Tonight"" on Monday.  ""They're not shocked about what we went through.  So many people have gone through it, too.  I don't understand how come they haven't fought it and how come they just let it go."" Johnson, best known for her roles in TV shows ""Punky Brewster"" and ""Family Matters,"" and White, from the movie ""Notorious,"" are speaking out about their treatment by a Marion County sheriff's deputy on September 22. ""I've been stopped by the police before, but I've never been fearful for my life,"" Johnson said on Sunday. ""They need some kind of sensitivity training."" The Marion County sheriff issued a statement on Monday promising to investigate the allegations of racial profiling. The couple, who were in the area after conducting an acting workshop in North Carolina, shared White's account with freelance writer Krystol Diggs, who posted it to CNN iReport. CNN could not independently verify their account but spoke directly to Johnson and Diggs about the incident. Johnson and White say they were on their way to Myrtle Beach for a quick romantic getaway when they pulled off the rural highway and parked by a cotton field. Johnson said she had never seen cotton before and told White she wanted to take a picture. As the couple walked back to the car, they said, they noticed a police car with its lights on parked behind theirs. White and Johnson, who are both African-American, say the white officer harshly questioned them about drugs -- he found none -- and the cash he found in their bags. Johnson was the national cheer representative for the Just Say No to Drugs campaign in the '80s. According to White's account, Officer Shad Barfield told Johnson there was a warrant for her arrest, which she disputed, and the officer later recanted. He handcuffed White and then Johnson but did not arrest them. ""After he told me that I did not have a warrant for my arrest, and he started asking me about drugs for the third time, I said, 'Are you doing this because we're black?'"" Johnson told HLN.  ""And that was when everything took a turn for the worst. He patted the car, he walked back to his car, he put on gloves. The next thing I knew, he was handcuffing Dennis."" ""He told me ... I was being detained for his safety because he didn't know me,"" Johnson said. ""At this time I became distraught,"" White wrote in his account of the incident. ""I have been racially profiled several times in my lifetime but it touched my core when my woman was included."" Marion County Sheriff Mark Richardson issued a statement on Monday in regard to the actors' claims: ""Discrimination in any form, including racial profiling, is strictly prohibited by this department and as Sheriff of Marion County SC, I can assure you I will take immediate and appropriate action to investigate the allegations of racial profiling made by Mr. White and Ms. Johnson. This matter will be dealt with by an internal investigation within the department and I will also ask the State Law Enforcement Division to review the allegation made against Deputy Barfield."" It was Johnson's first experience being handcuffed. Several of her family members work in law enforcement, Johnson said, adding that she's ""never been afraid of cops or had bad opinions of them."" This time was different. After thoroughly searching the car, the officer removed the handcuffs and let the couple go. ""No apology, no nothing,"" White wrote. White says he won't stop talking about the incident until ""that racist cop"" is reprimanded and punished. ""We've been conditioned to just think that it's OK -- that we have to just sweep it under the rug,"" White told HLN.  ""But we're not doing that no more.  We're fighting."" By Monday morning, the story had received nearly 700,000 views -- making it the fourth most-viewed iReport of all time -- and hundreds of comments about racial profiling and law enforcement in South Carolina and elsewhere. Many readers said they had experienced similar situations. Actress Kinnik Sky was among those who shared the story on her Facebook page. Sky, who was born and raised in Columbia, South Carolina, said she knew White and Johnson's account ""to be absolutely true."" ""I was like, 'Wow, boy can I relate,' because I am fearful of the cops as a whole, especially in South Carolina. My experiences have always been horrible."" The former ""American Idol"" finalist said whenever she returns from Los Angeles to her hometown she gets stopped by police ""80% of the time"" and questioned about drugs. On a recent trip she was ""stopped, pulled over and questioned about every drug known to man,"" she said. What's your reaction to White and Johnson's story? Sound off on iReport . Her account is strikingly similar to what Johnson and White said they experienced. Johnson said she contacted Marion County for an incident report but was told that one was never filed. In the meantime, she's voicing her views on Twitter and Facebook so others can know what she and White went through. ""I've always been a fan of speaking up and sharing your story,"" Johnson said. ""We're way more powerful in numbers than we are alone.""","Cherie Johnson and Dennis White say they were hassled by police because of their race .

"Police in Georgia defended their decision Tuesday to handcuff and arrest a 6-year-old elementary student after the school called to report a juvenile had assaulted a principal and was damaging school property. Milledgeville police said they were called to Creekside Elementary School on Friday for an unruly juvenile, who was allegedly throwing a tantrum. According to their report, when the officer arrived, he observed kindergartner Salecia Johnson on the floor of the principal's office screaming and crying. The officer stated in the report that he noticed damage to school property and tried numerous times to calm the girl, who eventually ""pulled away and began actively resisting and fighting with me."" ""The child was then placed in handcuffs for her safety and the officer proceeded to bring her down to the police station,"" said Chief Dray Swicord. Despite the girl's behavior, her family said police should not have been involved. ""I don't think she misbehaved to the point where she should have been handcuffed and taken downtown to the police department,""  Johnson's aunt, Candace Ruff, told CNN affiliate WMAZ. The girl was released to Ruff after numerous attempts to reach her parents failed, the police report said. Swicord said his department still has not heard from the girl's mother or father. But the parents have spoken to reporters. ""Call the police? Is that the first step?"" Johnson's mother, Constance Ruff, asked. Johnson's mother said she wondered if there was ""any other kind of intervention"" the school could have used to help her daughter. ""They don't have no business calling the police and handcuffing my child,"" said Salecia's father, Earnest Johnson. Regardless of age, said Swicord, ""When a person is put in handcuffs it's for their safety, it's not a punishment."" According to the police report, Johnson's combative behavior included throwing furniture, including a small shelf, which struck the principal on the leg. The child was also observed ""biting the doorknob of the office and jumping on the paper shredder."" The report stated Johnson also ""attempted to break a glass frame above the shredder."" ""I noticed the damage to school property and possible assault of other students and staff,"" the responding officer said in the report. CNN reached out to Creekside Elementary for comment but was told the principal is assisting with statewide testing and was unable to respond. Johnson's mother said her daughter was suspended and cannot return to school until August. The 6-year-old was initially charged as a juvenile with simple battery of a schoolteacher and criminal damage to property, but the police chief said at a news conference Tuesday the girl would not be charged because of her age. ""The student was never placed in a holding cell, or jail cell, and the student's safety was the utmost importance,"" Swicord said. He added she will be monitored by social agencies. Police notified the Department of Family and Children's Services about the incident, which is not the first of its kind in recent memory. In 2005, video of police in St. Petersburg, Florida handcuffing an unruly 5-year-old girl made headlines. In that case, the child could be seen pulling items form a bookcase, tearing papers from a bulletin board, climbing on a table and hitting a school official. The child appeared to have calmed down by the time police officers arrive, but began screaming as two officers, a man and a woman, stood her up, leaned her toward a table and handcuffed her. She was later turned over to her mother, who came to the school.","The episode recalls a 2005 incident in which a 5-year-old girl was handcuffed in Florida .

"One of the most prominent developers of the plan that could shut the government down is a little-known congressman who has been in office only eight months. This newly elected tea party aligned lawmaker downplays his position, saying he has relatively little influence. But in reality, his efforts have pushed Washington to the brink. At issue is the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Some Republicans are demanding that it be dismantled -- or at the very least delayed - and they think the best way to do that is attach it to a must-pass bill to fund the government. The idea has rankled Washington for more than a week and exposed fissures in the Republican Party. So who is the lawmaker quietly influencing the debate? Sen. Ted Cruz, who staged a 21-hour talk-a-thon on the Senate floor disparaging Obamacare, would be a good guess. But it would be wrong. The persuasive . The answer? Mark Meadows, who represents the western part of North Carolina and has wielded his influence behind the bright lights of the television cameras and the hot microphones. In August, while lawmakers spent time in their districts, Meadows wrote a letter to his Republican leaders suggesting they tie the dismantling of Obamacare to the bill that funds the government for the next year. The letter read: ""James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 58 that 'the power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon... for obtaining a redress of every grievance...'"" Meadows successfully convinced 79 of his colleagues to sign on to his letter.  And he went further, leading a group of 40 lawmakers to demand that the continuing resolution, or the short-term government funding bill at issue, zeroes out funding for President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement so far. Republican divisions force delay in Boehner's debt strategy . In a lengthy interview with CNN, Meadows explained his case. ""Our intent has never been to shut down the government,"" Meadows said. ""It's to stop the [health care] law."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called those advocating for such a plan ""anarchists."" A ""bad day for government is a good day for the tea party,"" Reid said on the Senate floor last week. Meadows vs. the GOP . Republican leaders in the House were reluctant and dismissed the plan -- at first. Speaker John Boehner and many Republicans believed the strategy could lead to shutdown as the Democratic-led Senate would never agree to such a plan. Additionally, leaders believed that Republicans would be blamed for a shut down. Polling backs up their concern. A recent CNN/ORC International Poll indicated that 51% of respondents would blame Republicans. That's a political risk that leadership didn't want to risk. Even though Meadows' letter doesn't represent a majority of the caucus, it was a factor in persuading Boehner to reverse course and put forward a plan that funds the government but defunds Obamacare. Running against politics . Meadows said he understands that ""leadership has a different responsibility."" And that leadership is responsible for thinking about the party. ""This type of vote could potentially hurt our long term goals. I understand that,"" he said. But he said that's not his concern. ""My job first is to make sure I represent the people back home,"" Meadows said. ""I don't believe that when I get here that people expect me to look at the political implications. That's for somebody else to focus on."" For him, getting rid of Obamacare is priority No. 1. ""[T]o ignore that would be to ignore our duty to represent the people back home,"" he said. 'Persona non grata' ""For me it's about representing the 749,000 people I was elected to represent,"" Meadows told CNN in his small Capitol Hill office. He said his constituents want him to fight against Obamacare ""regardless of consequences."" Meadows represents a conservative constituency. He was elected in 2012 and succeeded Democrat Heath Shuler, who decided not to run for reelection after the latest round of redistricting made the district swing heavily Republican. Meadows won by 15 percentage points. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney won the district with 61% of the vote, an impressive outcome in a state he won by 1 point. Exclusive: Romney disagrees with House GOP 'tactics' on Obamacare . But there's more to the story. Meadows works very closely with the tea party groups and he is a conduit to their agenda. In fact, his catapult from local businessman to elected official was launched with the help of local tea party groups. He underwent a vigorous interview process with the North Carolina-aligned tea party groups that included an intense vetting and interviewing process. Jane Bilello, head of the Asheville, North Carolina, tea party group and its separate political action committee, said it is to ensure candidates ""truly represents who we are and what we want them to do."" Bilello is pleased with Meadows' job performance so far. She said Meadows is ""turning out to be our poster boy."" On the issue of Obamacare, ""he truly represents us,"" Bilello said. Well-funded national tea party-aligned organizations, such Freedom Works, are also watching closely. Like Bilello's organization, they hold lawmakers accountable. Not only do they keep scorecards of how lawmakers vote on legislation, they are keeping track of what letters they sign on to and their role in every step of the legislative process. Republican leaders are well aware of the influence of these organizations. Republican Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska, who was elected in 1998 and finds himself between the new generation of tea party-aligned groups and the more traditional Republican leadership, said the tea party groups ""impacts everybody."" Billelo said that Meadows hosts conference calls with the groups' members to explain what's happening in Congress, including the challenges that he faces promoting their agenda. She said he told them he's ""persona non grata"" around the halls of Congress. Bilello said she and her members remind him: ""They don't elect you. We do."" They also offer assurance: ""We have your back. We will support you,"" Bilello said she tells him. Meadows relayed a similar sentiment. ""There's nobody in Washington, D.C., who ever voted for me and there's no one in Washington, D.C., who will ever vote for me,"" Meadows said. ""So it's about representing the people back home."" The non-leadership leader . ""I think everybody wants me to pick a fight with leadership,"" Meadows said. But he contended that he isn't about playing the rebel, but finding results. Are his tactics working? Meadows said yes. ""The Senate for the first time is having to vote ... on Obamacare,"" Meadows said. ""That's why we had to do this."" The House has now voted 42 times on either defunding or repealing all or parts of Obamacare. Many Republicans in the Senate thought the idea was a lost cause, including Texas Republican John Cornyn, who said Friday that the strategy ""won't work."" The Senate eliminated the health care portion of the bill on Friday before sending a revised spending plan back to the House for consideration over the weekend. A shutdown would occur Tuesday, if there is no spending plan in place. But Meadows successfully convinced a reluctant Boehner to go along with his plan. And then after it became clear the Senate wasn't going to play ball, the speaker hoped to move past the fight and pass a funding bill that would be able to pass the Senate, meaning it wouldn't defund health care. But Boehner's Republican caucus, once again with Meadows in the forefront, rejected that plan. Boehner's now working on a plan that will appease members such as Meadows. What do shutdown and debt limit have to do with Obamacare? Meanwhile, Meadows vowed to hold his ground. ""If there is a real plan to make sure we can accomplish it through some other means, I'm willing to look at that,"" he said. But he said it must involve ""at least delaying"" the implementation of Obamacare. If it doesn't, he is willing to buck his leadership and oppose any bill he doesn't think goes far enough. He admits some will have to take ""some tough votes"" to take. But for him he's right where his constituents want him to be. ""It's a safe place for me to be,"" Meadows said. Polarizing Washington . Meadows rejected the idea that he is adding to the gridlock in Washington. He said Washington politicians have lost their way, but it's not because of their inability to compromise. ""Pragmatism has been at the cost of principle and principle has been at the cost of pragmatism,"" he said. Still, Meadows asserted that he is willing to compromise with the Democrats. ""My ultimate success will be viewed by whether there is something we can accomplish,"" he said.","A little-known, freshman congressman is flexing his legislative muscle in Congress .

"Whew, it's all over, folks -- the twin crises of government shutdown and national default countdown. At least for now. This one wasn't easy. And we'll be talking about it for a while. That's just one of the four lessons we take away from this calamity in our capital. A walk in the park . We love our parks. Boy, do we love our national parks. That was evident in a public outcry, on social media and elsewhere. Isn't it nice that in our deprivation, we found something to appreciate? The shuttered national parks didn't stop some visitors from trying to sneak onto back roads or lookout points to steal a quiet view of nature. However, armed park rangers who were mandated to work during the shutdown thwarted many motorists by swinging the road gates closed. 9 things we missed during the shutdown . The Grand Old Party isn't so grand . It's a great thing to have conservatives and liberals giving us different viewpoints on how to run the country, but the Republican Party -- the party of President Lincoln -- now seems a house divided. Cruz won't rule out another shutdown . McConnell: Further shutdowns 'off the table' Can the GOP heal an internal rift between establishment conservatives and the new conservatives of the tea party? For the moment, the Republicans are cited as the top cause for the shutdown, evidenced by a CNN/ORC poll showing the GOP is the biggest target of American anger, with 63% of respondents venting their ire at them. Democrats fared only slightly better, however, with 58% expressing anger at them, too. And 53% were angry at President Barack Obama. Winners and losers from the shutdown crisis . Economic damage . For a country fresh out of a great recession, the 16-day shutdown was costly: It took $24 billion out of the economy, Standard & Poor's says. As a result, the United States will grow 2.4% -- instead of 3% -- this quarter, meaning there won't be as many new jobs that many American families desperately need in the post-recession era. A sequel . As difficult as this drama was, there will be a Part II. The Hollywood horror genre doesn't have anything over Washington. The government is funded until January 15 -- meaning Americans will be forced to witness another round of Democrat-Republican budget negotiations. It gets better, or worse, depending on your viewpoint: The debt ceiling will have to be revisited, too, by February 7. All this makes some economists worry that Americans will now be afraid to invest, create jobs, and go shopping this holiday season. Perhaps John Chambers, managing director of Standard and Poor's rating service, put it best: . ""We think that we'll be back here in January debating the same issues,"" Chambers said. ""This is, I fear, a permanent feature of our budgetary process."" Playing nice: Budget talks may start with an extra-friendly tone .","Amid our deprivations during the shutdown, we appreciate our national parks .
The party of Lincoln seems to be a house divided .
Ouch, the U.S. economy lost $24 billion .
Like a Hollywood horror film, there's going to be a sequel ."
"Former Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill said in an interview with The Washington Post that he was the one who fired the final shot to kill Osama bin Laden in 2011. The 38-year-old Montanan also said that other SEAL team members were involved in the raid, including Matt Bissonnette, who detailed the group's experiences in his memoir, ""No Easy Day."" O'Neill, who had been serving as a SEAL for 15 years at the time of the bin Laden raid, had participated in other missions before -- but he said he feared this mission would be his most difficult. ""I didn't think I would survive,"" he told the Post. He said it was clear that Bin Laden had been killed and not merely injured from his shot when he fell to the floor with a split skull. Before he was shot, bin Laden ""had his hands on a woman's shoulders pushing her ahead,"" O'Neill recounts, likely to deflect the attack. CNN's Barbara Starr confirmed from a U.S. official that O'Neill was on the raid. Two Special Operations sources confirmed to CNN's National Security analyst Peter Bergen that O'Neill was one of the shooters in bin Laden's room -- but others in the military community have wondered whether he can claim to kill bin Laden since there were at least two others in the room who fired weapons. Did Robert O'Neill really kill bin Laden? The Navy SEAL had previously revealed details of the mission to Esquire magazine. But he was hesitant to attach his name to the account until his identity was linked to the story on a military blog earlier this week without his consent. O'Neill also said his secret was known by members of Congress and some news organizations. He also told the Post that he received a positive response from the families of 9/11 victims when he identified himself as bin Laden's killer to them. ""The families told me it helped bring them some closure,"" he said. SEAL commander to SEALs: Seal it . O'Neill's move to go public is a controversial one, as it violates an unspoken military rule: Don't seek attention for your service. ""We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety or financial gain,"" said an Oct. 31 letter to the Naval Special Warfare ranks from commanding officer B.L. Losey and force master sergeant M.L. Margaraci. CNN has reached out to O'Neill but has not received a response.","Former Navy SEAL says he shot and killed Osama bin Laden .

"(CNN) -- The prominent man had an altercation with his wife at a hotel. He beat her up. There's even a recording of it. And what happened? A plea deal so generous that the abuser's arrest record will be expunged -- totally clean, as if the whole thing had never happened -- if he receives some counseling in the next few months. Ray Rice? Yes. But Rice's case is strikingly similar to that of Mark Fuller, a sitting federal judge in Alabama. On August 9, Fuller's wife called 911 from a hotel room in Atlanta, according to news reports. The woman identified as Kelli Fuller said her drunk husband was assaulting her. ""He's beating on me. Please help me,"" she said. About a minute into the call, as dispatchers summon help, Kelli Fuller is heard saying ""I hate you, I hate you."" A male voice responds: ""I hate you too,"" followed by dull noises in the background. According to police, Kelli Fuller had cuts to her mouth and forehead and she told them her husband had thrown her to the ground, pulled her hair and kicked her after she confronted him over an alleged affair with a law clerk. Last week, the whole matter was swept discreetly under the rug. Mark Fuller accepted ""pretrial diversion"" offered by Atlanta prosecutors. Under the deal, the judge has to have a drug and alcohol evaluation -- which, according to his lawyer, he doesn't need. ""He doesn't have a drug or alcohol problem and never has,"" Barry Ragsdale, Fuller's attorney, told al.com. Then, Fuller will have to undergo a once-a-week family and domestic violence program for 24 weeks. The judge can undergo that counseling at a location close to home in Alabama. What happens after Fuller completes counseling? He plans to return to the bench, to pass judgment on others. As Fuller put it, ""I also look forward to ... returning to full, active status in the Middle District of Alabama."" (His cases have been temporarily reassigned. Taxpayers are paying him his full salary in the meantime.) The parallels between the Rice and Fuller cases extend further. In both cases, the couples stayed together. After Ray beat his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer, unconscious in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the couple married. Janay Rice attended the July meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that led to his appallingly lenient two-game suspension from the Baltimore Ravens. NFL toughens domestic violence policy with six-game bans . After TMZ released the video of the elevator assault, Janay Rice released a statement of support for her husband, on Instagram. ""To take something away from the man I love that he has worked for all his life just to gain ratings is horrific,"" she wrote, ""If your intentions were to hurt us, embarrass us, make us feel alone, take our happiness away, you've succeeded on so many levels. Just know we will continue to grow & show the world what love is."" Fuller is also attempting, apparently successfully, to repair the breach with his wife. ""This incident has been very embarrassing to me, my family, friends and the court,"" he said in his statement, ""I deeply regret this incident and look forward to working to resolve these difficulties with my family, where they should be resolved."" Consider that last line: ""my family, where they should be resolved."" This is precisely wrong, and it contributes to a fundamental misunderstanding about domestic violence. When husbands beat up their wives, that is not a matter that should be resolved within the family. It is a crime to be resolved by the legal system. In cases of domestic violence, the question is often raised whether the victim will ""press charges."" But it's not victims who press charges in this country, it's the state. Ray Rice video prompts stories of #WhyIStayed, #WhyILeft . It's not up to victims to decide whether their husbands should be prosecuted. Abusers damage the community, not just the women they assault. Whether the Rices and Fullers stay married is their business; but whether Ray Rice and Judge Mark Fuller committed crimes should be a question for prosecutors, and ultimately, juries to decide. Unfortunately, it looks like the prosecutors failed in Atlantic City and Atlanta. The sweet deals for these two prominent defendants cannot be undone; the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution forbids it. All the rest of us can do is hope that the next prominent man who beats up his wife doesn't get off as easy.","Jeffrey Toobin: Ray Rice case mirrors Alabama judge's case; both got plea deals .

"Morgan City, Louisiana (CNN) -- Residents in Louisiana's Atchafalaya River basin packed up treasured possessions and scrambled to build makeshift levees Monday as federal authorities diverted more water their way from the swollen Mississippi. ""We just moved in here, and now we're in the process of moving everything out,"" said Jake Nolan, of the town of Krotz Springs. But he added, ""I have no choice. If not, I'm going to lose everything."" Krotz Springs, with a population of about 1,300, is now in the path of hundreds of thousands of gallons of water now entering the Atchafalaya basin every second since the weekend opening of the Mississippi's Morganza Spillway. The controlled release succeeded in dropping projected flood levels for New Orleans and Baton Rouge -- but that was little consolation to those living along the Atchafalaya, which parallels the Mississippi through southern Louisiana. ""Hope you appreciate this Baton Rouge. You're welcome,"" read one sign posted outside a home in the path of the flooding. Signs of resilience in flooded lowlands . In Krotz Springs, about 20 miles from the spillway, Mayor Carroll Snyder told CNN that workers are scrambling to put together a temporary levee to protect about 240 homes on the south side of town. ""They're not happy with it, but it's something that we've been knowing for quite some time -- that it was inevitable, that it would have to be opened,"" Snyder said. ""They've come to deal with it."" And in Butte La Rose, about 20 miles further south, St. Martin Parish President Guy Cormier said about three-quarters of his constituents' homes are expected to suffer water damage after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened the spillway on Saturday. ""It's a slow, painful rise, but it is rising just a little bit every night,"" Cormier told CNN. The diversion will drain water from the Mississippi through the Atchafalaya basin to the Gulf of Mexico at Morgan City. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal offered at least a ray of hope to his state's residents on Monday, saying the decision to open the spillway has lowered crest projections in parts of the state. Scared evacuees flee homes . Just as important, river observations now suggest the Corps may need to divert less water from the spillway than initially thought, he said. But based on historical estimates, damages to agriculture alone in Louisiana could total $300 million, Jindal said. The Corps of Engineers opened two gates in the Morganza Spillway on Saturday, the first release from the facility since 1973. By Monday night, 15 of the structure's 125 bays had been opened, divertnig about 102,000 cubic feet (763,000 gallons) of water per second, Corps spokeswoman Rachel Rodi told CNN. The plan is eventually to open about a quarter of the spillway, according to the agency. In Morgan City, the rising Atchafalaya was already lapping at a downtown riverwalk Monday evening. Mike Stack, a Corps of Engineers spokesman, told CNN's ""John King USA"" that 20,000 to 25,000 homes could be flooded, but the agency and Louisiana authorities are working to limit the damage. ""The system is under tremendous pressure, and it will be for a long time, so our key concern is making sure that we're vigilant,"" Stack said. ""We're out there on the system, making sure the system stays intact while we're still working with the communities to try to help with the flooding."" Your guide to flooding terms . Officials say the spillway's gates are likely to be open for weeks, and it will be weeks before the river falls below flood stage and those who have evacuated can safely return. The flood is the most significant to hit the lower Mississippi River valley since at least 1937 and has so far affected nine states: Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Across the South and lower Midwest, floodwaters have already covered about 3 million acres of farmland, eroding for many farmers what could have been a profitable year for corn, wheat, rice and cotton, officials said. As many as 22 cities and communities where river levels are monitored by the U.S. government remain flooded, some of them weeks after both the Mississippi and Ohio rivers climbed out of their banks. A near-record crest on the Mississippi is forecast in Greenville, Mississippi, early Tuesday, followed through the weekend by record crests in Vicksburg and Natchez, Mississippi; Red River Landing, Louisiana, and Baton Rouge, according to the National Weather Service. In Greenville, more than 200 miles north of the spillway, the river was just short of its projected crest of 64.3 feet at noon Monday, according to the Weather Service. That was more than 16 feet over flood stage and less than a foot below the peak of the historic flood of 1927. In Natchez, the river is expected to rise five feet above the 1927 record of 58 feet, weather service forecasts show. The predicted crest is 15 feet above flood stage, and the Coast Guard has closed the river to navigation along a 15-mile stretch near the city, Cmdr. Mark Moland said Monday. High water has already chased members of the U.S. Coast Guard stationed in Natchez from their offices, Chief Boatswain's Mate Bo Smith said. The 16 people stationed there are currently working aboard the USCG Cutter Greenbriar, Smith said. The weather service predicted the Mississippi River will crest at 45 feet in Baton Rouge, the Louisiana capital, on Tuesday. That is 2.5 feet lower and six days earlier than the weather service had forecast prior to the opening of the Morganza spillway. On Monday, it was 44.6 feet. In New Orleans, the river on Monday was already cresting at 17 feet, one week earlier and more than two feet lower than previously projected by the National Weather Service. It is also four feet lower than the historic level recorded in New Orleans in 1922. But six days after the Mississippi River crested at Memphis, Tennessee, the water remains 11 feet above flood stage, according to the National Weather Service. President Barack Obama spent about 35 minutes privately speaking with flood victims and responders during a visit to Memphis on Monday, according to Press Secretary Jay Carney. CNN's Ed Lavandera, Martin Savidge, Justin Lear, Jacqui Jeras, Mary Grace Lucas, Ashley Hayes and Ben Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: 15 of 125 Morganza Spillway gates are now open .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- At least 45 people, most of them voodoo priests, have been lynched in Haiti since the beginning of the cholera epidemic by angry mobs blaming them for the spread of the disease, officials said. ""People who practice voodoo have nothing to do with the cholera epidemic,"" said Max Beauvoir, the head of a voodoo organization in the Caribbean country. Beauvoir said Thursday that he has appealed to authorities to help before the situation gets worse. Some of the victims were killed with machetes, others were burned alive by mobs that added tires and gasoline to stoke the fires. The cholera outbreak started in October. Forty of the victims were found in a southwest area of Haiti called Grand Anse, said Moise Fritz Evens, a communications ministry official. The victims have been targeted because of ""misinformation"" that had been circulating in the community that voodoo practitioners were spreading cholera by using witchcraft, according to communications Minister Marie-Laurence Lassegue. ""It was necessary to increase awareness of the disease and educate the population countrywide instead of getting into a religious war that has no ending,"" Lassegue said. The killings add to ongoing woes that have hit the island after the devastating earthquake in January. About 220,000 people were killed in the earthquake, and countless others left homeless. A cholera outbreak after the earthquake has killed more than 2,000 people, health officials said.","40 of the victims were found in one area in southwest Haiti .

"Standing side-by-side behind the front window of their home, Lenora Hunter and her husband, Wayne, shot videos of the powerful tornado barreling toward this southern Indiana town. The images and sound of the couple talking with each other have taken on a decidedly tragic air since the March 2 EF4 twister -- with sustained winds of between 166 mph and 200 mph -- moved through Clark County. ""It was my last time with him,"" Lenora Hunter told CNN. Wayne Hunter, 62, did not survive the storm. He was among 39 killed, 13 of them in Indiana, by a powerful Midwest and Southern storm system. Amazingly, the Hunters' cameras survived the powerful winds that flattened their home. Lenora Hunter shared the dramatic footage publicly for the first time with CNN. ""I always wanted to see a tornado, but not like that. That was huge, huge,"" she said. Indiana mom loses legs saving kids from tornado . Wayne wasn't particularly a fan of storms, but Lenora, 59, was. ""We watched 'Twister' (the movie) quite a bit,"" she said. ""I could quote practically all of it."" But this twister was the real thing. The Hunters, married 41 years, are heard on the video describing the tornado heading their way. Lenora Hunter says it wasn't clear at first that it would stay on course toward their home. Then things changed. ""It looks like it's heading right toward us,"" Wayne Hunter is heard telling his wife. ""Maybe we should get away from the window,"" she replies. Her husband utters an expletive under his breath and laughs nervously as they describe the tornado's funnel changing colors and picking up more debris. ""We'll need to close the window. I've got to close the door,"" Lenora Hunter says. ""Oh my gosh,"" she says breathlessly. The tape on her camera then cuts off. At that point, Hunter said, the couple ran to the center of their single-story home, which had no basement. ""It was time."" Her husband grabbed his wallet and she grabbed her purse. ""They're going to know who I am,"" she recalled thinking. ""I was still cracking jokes. We were going to be OK. I kept telling him we'll be fine."" ""We hunkered down. Put the blanket over us. We had arms around each other,"" Lenora Hunter said Friday, her voice breaking, as she showed CNN how the couple crouched and held each other tightly. ""He said 'I love you.' I said, 'I love you, too.'"" They were the couple's last words to each other. Lenora Hunter describes hearing a roar and her ears popping. Then she blacked out. ""I remember waking up and yelling, screaming, 'Help us!'"" she said. ""I mean my whole body, it was like I was just crushed. And I couldn't see anything,"" says Hunter. Neighbors Cole Belcher and Michael Sipe heard sounds like a baby crying. They found Lenora Hunter. ""All you could see was her head and a bunch of blood,"" said Belcher. The woman was badly bruised, but suffered no broken bones. ""We just knew we needed to get her out of there somehow,"" Sipe said. But, first, they found Wayne Hunter. He was lying next to his wife, covered by a refrigerator. ""I remember shaking his arm saying, 'Wayne, Wayne,' and he never responded,"" Belcher said. 'I said, 'Is he (Wayne) OK?,"" Lenora Hunter recalled. ""He (Belcher) said, 'No, ma'am,' which was the perfect answer, because I wouldn't have wanted someone to say, 'Well, I think he'll be OK.'  I saw him. And I knew."" As softball-sized hail landed, Sipe took Lenora Hunter by the hand, covered her head with a roasting pan, and led her to safety. While sitting on the concrete steps that used to lead to her front door, Hunter cried softly as she recalled another section of their final home videos. On the tape, Lenora initially sounds excited as the tornado approaches. ""I have never seen one. I finally get to see one,"" she tells Wayne. ""Maybe the last one I see,"" she tells him. Wayne laughs and replies, ""That's true."" As she recalled those recorded words, Lenora buried her head in her hands and cried. ""It was. It was for Wayne."" Wayne Hunter, a retired emergency room nurse, served in the Army and was stationed in Korea during the Vietnam War, according to his son, Rodney. Wayne's widow intends to rebuild in the same spot where their home once stood and where the couple planned to enjoy the rest of their retirement. The residence will include a basement. ""This is our home. And it will be my home forever,"" Lenora Hunter told CNN. She has the support of her two grown children and grandchildren -- and says her faith will pull her through. ""I will make it. Sometimes it's hard, but I'm going to be OK."" Lenora Hunter dabs her eyes. ""I'm gonna miss him. A whole lot.""","A powerful tornado struck the town of Henryville in southern Indiana .

"Guy, Arkansas (CNN) -- Things are still shaking in Arkansas. More than 500 measurable earthquakes have been reported in central Arkansas since September 20, ranging in magnitude from a barely noticeable 1.8 to a very noticeable 4.0 (recorded on October 11), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Geologists can't say whether they'll stop anytime soon. Steve Wilson is looking forward to the quakes going away, he said. ""In the beginning, it was fun, it was neat, it was a cool thing to experience. But now we're wanting it to go away,"" said Wilson, assistant superintendent at Woolly Hallow State Park. ""We've had all the fun we want."" Although drilling for natural gas has been ruled out as a cause for the quakes, experts want to continue looking at salt water disposal wells, said Scott Ausbrooks, geohazards supervisor for the Geological Survey. Disposal wells occur when drilling waster is injected back into the earth after drilling. Earlier this month, the Arkansas Oil and Gas  commission issued an emergency moratorium on permits for new disposal wells. The commission will ask for a six-month extension for the moratorium at a January regulatory meeting. The state also will soon become one of a few to require companies to disclose the chemicals used in fracking fluid, the water-and-chemical solution used in high-pressure drilling operations, said Shane Khoury, deputy director and general counsel for the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission. ""I think everyone recognizes that there is an increased number of seismic events occurring in and around this area. If you look at the maps, at least circumstantially, there appears to be evidence that they may be related to disposal operations,"" said Khoury. ""But we also know that this is an area that is historically active."" Meanwhile, Sam Higdon, the mayor of Guy, says the quakes' novelty is worn out. ""I think everyone just kind of figures maybe it'll just go away,"" he said. ""And that's what we're all hoping.""","More than 500 earthquakes have been recorded in Arkansas in the past few weeks .

"(CNN)Wednesday's attack in Paris was not the first attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo, nor the first terror attack planned against a European publication. But it was by far the most lethal act of terrorism to target the media  in modern Europe. It raises many troubling questions for the future of a free press, unhindered in its reporting by fear. And it will reopen the debate on where freedom of speech becomes incitement and where restraint equals self-censorship. Charlie Hebdo has published many cartoons lampooning Islamist extremism and, more recently, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. One recent cartoon featured ISIS' leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Under editor Stephane Charbonnier, who was among those killed Wednesday, it has been one of several European publications to make a point of taking on extremism and religious intolerance -- knowing it risked deadly consequences. Even when these publications have come under attack, they have continued plowing a lonely and provocative furrow. Charlie Hebdo's offices were destroyed by a gasoline bomb in 2011 after the magazine carried a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed on the cover, saying ""100 lashes if you are not dying of laughter."" A cartoon inside showed the prophet with a clown's nose. It also announced he would be editor-in-chief of the next edition. No one was hurt in that attack. Depiction of the prophet is prohibited in Islam and, along with desecration of the Quran, enrages jihadists even more than images of prison abuse or airstrikes -- precisely because it is aimed directly at the prophet and the holy book. Charbonnier said at the time of the 2011 attack that it was the work of ""idiot extremists"" and insisted the magazine had the right to poke fun at anything. And then-French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said at the time: ""Freedom of expression is an inalienable right in our democracy and all attacks on the freedom of the press must be condemned with the greatest firmness."" But Wednesday's attack shows that condemnation and round-the-clock protection of the media are two entirely different things. There was a regular police presence at the offices of Charlie Hebdo, but the  officers appear to have been as much a target as the journalists -- an easy, static target for a well-organized attack. And what organizations merit protection? In the aftermath of Wednesday's attack, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced that ""media organizations, major stores, religious places and public transport (in the Paris area) will be provided with reinforced security."" It is the obvious response, but some would argue that this is just what terrorists want: a climate of fear. In February 2006, Charlie Hebdo reprinted cartoons of the prophet that had first appeared in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, itself the target of several plots by Islamist extremists. The magazine said it was reprinting the cartoons in support of press freedom, but then-French President Jacques Chirac criticized the decision as ""overt provocation."" The editor of another French newspaper was fired for reprinting the cartoons. Charlie Hebdo was also taken to court by two Islamic groups in France but acquitted of incitement to racism. The court decided there had been no ""deliberate intention of directly and gratuitously offending the Muslim community."" Charlie Hebdo: Satirical magazine is no stranger to controversy . That case encapsulated the dilemma for governments and the media in Europe. When does the exercise of free speech become incitement, provocation or an act of racism? And is self-censorship necessary in a multicultural society where restraint helps social peace and provocation can bring violence? The original publication of the cartoons in Jyllands-Posten in September 2005 caused riots across the Muslim world in which an estimated 130 people were killed. The newspaper received more than 100 death threats. Flemming Rose, the culture editor of the newspaper, later published an article in The Washington Post entitled ""Why I Published Those Cartoons,"" which is worth quoting at length: . ""I commissioned the cartoons in response to several incidents of self-censorship in Europe caused by widening fears and feelings of intimidation in dealing with issues related to Islam. ... The idea wasn't to provoke gratuitously -- and we certainly didn't intend to trigger violent demonstrations throughout the Muslim world. Our goal was simply to push back self-imposed limits on expression that seemed to be closing in tighter."" He gave an example, saying one Danish comedian had told Jyllands-Posten that he had no problem urinating on the Bible in front of a camera, but he dared not do the same thing with the Quran. The Tate Gallery in London had confronted the same dilemma -- withdrawing a work called ""God is Great"" by John Latham which depicted torn images of the Bible, the Quran and the Talmud. The Tate said that in the wake of the July 2005 bombings, displaying the work would ""not be appropriate."" Some have argued that restraint shows respect and is not cowing to extremism. As Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams argued in 2008 for stronger measures against incitement of religious hatred, saying that the ""sound of a prosperous and socially secure voice claiming unlimited freedom both to define and to condemn the beliefs of a minority grates on the ear."" There are also some who see the publication of provocative images as a cheap way to publicity. The critic Michael Kimmelman wrote in The New York Times at the height of the cartoon controversy that ""modern artists and their promoters forever pander to a like-minded audience by goading obvious targets, hoping to incite reactions that pass for political point-scoring."" If anything, the atmosphere in Europe is now more combustible than it was in 2006. Recession has brought unemployment -- in France it is rising fast -- and with it, less tolerance for immigration and minorities, even when they are well established. The anti-immigrant National Front in France topped the poll in last year's elections to the European Parliament. In the UK, the anti-Europe and anti-immigration party UKIP has made spectacular gains in by-elections. And in Germany, a group calling itself Pegida -- Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West -- drew nearly 20,000 people to a recent rally in Dresden. Despite condemnation from Chancellor Angela Merkel as well as German business and labor unions, Pegida continues undaunted to challenge the establishment. At the same time, the rise of Islamist militancy has seeped into many of the Muslim immigrant communities that have grown across Europe in the last generation. Younger Muslims, with few prospects and often alienated by what they perceive as victimization by police, are vulnerable to recruitment by extremists. Several thousand from across Europe have already gone to Syria and Iraq, many to fight for jihadist groups such as ISIS and al Nusra. The French Interior Ministry estimates that hundreds of French citizens have left or plan to leave to join the ranks of jihadist groups in Syria or Iraq. A video released by ISIS in November showed three French jihadists calling on other French Muslims to join the fight or carry out attacks in France. One of the fighters said: ""Terrorize them and do not allow them to sleep due to fear and horror. There are weapons and cars available and targets ready to be hit. Even poison is available, so poison the water and food of at least one of the enemies of Allah. Kill them and spit in their faces and run over them with your cars."" Others have already come back from Syria and Iraq. One was arrested and charged in the gun attack on a Jewish museum in Brussels last year; another was detained in the south of France after bomb-making equipment was found in his apartment. France and Britain have introduced tougher anti-terrorism laws that allow for the confiscation of passports of those suspected of intending to travel to Syria and Iraq to join militant groups. But a free society doesn't have the resources, the laws or even perhaps the will to track all such individuals. Ultimately, journalists who want to publish material that's clearly offensive or inflammatory to some will have to accept the inherent risks in this new environment. Some, like Flemming Rose at Jyllands-Posten, accept that. ""If a believer demands that I, as a nonbeliever, observe his taboos in the public domain, he is not asking for my respect, but for my submission. And that is incompatible with a secular democracy,"" he wrote.","Gunmen kill journalists at magazine that lampooned Islamic extremism, ISIS .

"(CNN)Ever since musician Eduardo Miranda met a patient with locked in syndrome 11 years ago, he has been on a mission to create a way for the paralyzed to make music. His latest invention is the brain computer music interface (BCMI) which allows people to create music using just their eyes. How it works . By connecting electrodes to the back of the head, the system can tell where you're looking by monitoring brain activity. Flashing icons representing different snippets of music appear on screen and you can make a selection, just by staring at one. In real time, a musician plays a score generated from the user's selections. ""Our brain is producing electricity all the time,"" says Miranda, head of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research at Plymouth University. ""These are very faint electrical signals but we can amplify and analyze them. Let's say you have two icons on the computer screen: one flashing at 10 hertz and the other flashing at 15 hertz. If you look at the one flashing at 15 hertz, we can detect it."" ""We can detect up to eight different frequencies at the moment,"" explains Eduardo Miranda who is helped by a team of doctoral students and research assistants at his lab. ""My latest composition is for a string quartet. It's an interaction between eight people, four of them generating music and the others playing the music as its being generated. ""The score for the quartet is a computer monitor rather than sheet music so the musicians have to be quite skilled and perform the piece as it's generated."" Listen to Miranda's string quartet playing using the BCMI. Motivation . Speaking of his inspiration for the project, Miranda says: ""I wanted to create something to enable people with severe disabilities to make music. I was struck by an encounter I had once with a man who had had a stroke and was paralyzed completely from the neck down. ""That had a profound impact on me and I thought, as a musician, how I could provide a voice for him -- that's where this research began."" He adds: ""A few years ago I tested a prototype with a paralyzed patient in a hospital in London he was able to play music by looking as these icons. The nurses and carers there told me that one of the things that these patients really miss is interaction with other people, not with machines. That's how this system was created."" Funding . It has been 11 years since Miranda started his lab, with financial support from Plymouth University as well as securing funding throughout the years. He has also been successful in securing funding from engineering organizations such as the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. ""It was very difficult at the beginning to convince people that this research could work and produce something useful. It sounded like science fiction to begin with, people didn't believe it. But as I began to produce results, papers and scientific journals, it became easier to put the arguments on paper."" Future plans . Miranda is now working on making the system more robust and user-friendly. But it might be a while before his technology hits the shops, not least because it costs around £10,000 (around $15,600). ""I don't think I would sell the BCMI, the problem is that the hardware is very expensive ... all the electrodes you need we have to buy ourselves. ""I would be quite happy to give away the software to people who really need it, provided they are able to buy the hardware."" ""We have seen companies selling equipment (at) a tenth of the price of ours promising a lot of things, but when you really test them they don't compare to ours. ""It's going to take a long time for this to become cheap,"" he says. But you may soon be able to try out the software in your local ""brain booth."" ""We are working on a project, which will allow the public to use the system in a 'brain booth' and download the music they create from the internet afterward. ""You don't need musical talent to use the system, but the more you understand music the easier it is for you -- if you understand for example that crochets are quicker than semi-quavers you have an idea of what you're selecting -- but after 10 seconds you hear the snippet of music you chose being played by the string quartet, so you learn quickly."" Julie Tugwell, from the Queen Elizabeth's Foundation for Disabled People, who was involved with a similar project, thinks the technology could have wider applications. ""It was amazing to explore how technology can help to unleash the creativity within people that they may find difficulty expressing through traditional methods."" ""We're also looking forward to seeing how brain-wave technology might, in the near future, be able to control other types of equipment such as wheelchairs or computers,"" she says.","Eduardo Miranda has created a system which allows people to make music using their eyes .
The system uses electrodes and was inspired by people suffering from paralysis .

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- The United States has concluded Syria carried out chemical weapons attacks against its people, President Barack Obama said Wednesday, a claim that comes amid a looming diplomatic showdown over whether to strike against Bashar al-Assad's military. Obama's declaration to ""PBS NewsHour"" came at the end of a day that saw Russia and China walk out of a U.N. Security Council meeting as word surfaced Britain planned to pursue a resolution to authorize the use of force against Syria, even as United Nations weapons inspectors were in Syria assessing whether chemical weapons have been used. ""We do not believe that, given the delivery systems, using rockets, that the opposition could have carried out these attacks. We have concluded that the Syrian government in fact carried these out,"" Obama told ""NewsHour."" ""And if that's so, then there need to be international consequences,"" the president added. Obama said that he has ""not made a decision"" about whether to conduct a military strike in Syria. Allegations of a chemical weapons attack carried out by al-Assad's forces in a Damascus suburb last week triggered the international machinations, which have been growing as body counts on both sides in the more-than-2-year-old civil war have increased. Those who claimed to have survived the alleged chemical weapons attack described a horrific scene in the town of Zamalka. ""After the chemicals, they woke us up and told us to put masks on,"" a 6-year-old boy said, describing the alleged attack. ""I told my dad I can't breathe. My father then fainted and I fainted right after that, but we were found and taken to the emergency room."" CNN obtained video of the boy and others who made the claims to a journalist in the area. Al-Assad's government has blamed rebels for carrying out the attack, a claim that Obama told PBS was impossible. ""We have looked at all the evidence, and we do not believe the opposition possessed ... chemical weapons of that sort,"" he said. ""We do not believe that, given the delivery systems, using rockets, that the opposition could have carried out these attacks."" In the video obtained by CNN, one man claimed he evacuated two dead bodies during the attack. ""Then there was another explosion. I couldn't breathe, I had cramps and I couldn't see. The doctors helped me."" The horror of the attack on civilians has jolted the world into potential action on a crisis that has killed more than 100,000 people, according to the United Nations. Last week was not the first time chemical weapons are believed to have been used in the conflict. But it was by far the worst. 'Red line' debate: Chemical weapons worse than attacks? ""Syria is now undoubtedly the most serious crisis facing the international community,"" Lakhdar Brahimi, U.N. and Arab League special envoy to Syria, said Wednesday in Geneva. ""It does seem that some kind of substance was used that killed a lot of people,"" he said. The death toll could be in the hundreds, or possibly more than a thousand, he said. Brahimi said the crisis in Syria shows how important it is ""for the Syrians and the international community to really develop the political will to address this issue seriously and look for solutions for it."" NATO also followed suit with a warning of its own Wednesday. ""The Syrian regime maintains custody of stockpiles of chemical weapons. Information available from a wide variety of sources points to the Syrian regime as responsible for the use of chemical weapons in these attacks. This is a clear breach of long-standing international norms and practice. ""Any use of such weapons is unacceptable and cannot go unanswered. Those responsible must be held accountable. We consider the use of chemical weapons as a threat to international peace and security,"" NATO said in a statement. Some Syrians have told CNN they doubt their government used chemical weapons. 'Not warmongers' Syrian Ambassador to the United Nations Bashar Jaafari lashed out Wednesday at the warnings and threats. ""We are not warmongers. We are a peaceful nation seeking stability in the area because instability would serve the Israeli interests,"" he told reporters at the U.N. headquarters in New York. ""We are in a state of war,"" and preparing for the possibility of such a scenario, he said. ""The Syrian government is looking for stability."" Jaafari accused rebels of obtaining material to produce chemical weapons ""from outside powers -- mainly speaking, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar."" Intervening in Middle East turmoil: Mission impossible? In a letter to the United Nations, Syria asked for the U.N. weapons inspectors to stay in the country beyond their weekend deadline, Jaafari said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon did not address the letter directly but seemed to ask for a reprieve Wednesday for the sake of the inspectors. ""The team needs time to do its job,"" he said from The Hague, where he visited the International Criminal Court. He said the inspectors had already collected valuable evidence. 'Groundless excuses' Russia, a close ally of Syria, is expected to use its veto power to block a resolution, setting up a possible diplomatic showdown. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov insists there is no proof yet Syria's government is behind the chemical weapons attack. The ministry accused Washington of trying to ""create artificial groundless excuses for military intervention."" ""The West handles the Islamic world the way a monkey handles a grenade,"" Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin tweeted. Missile strikes on Syria likely response to chemical attack . China, which also has a permanent seat on the council, would also probably object to military measures. ""It's time that the United Nations Security Council shouldered its responsibilities on Syria, which for the past two and a half years it's failed to do,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Wednesday. He added that even if China and Russia veto a resolution, ""We and other nations still have a responsibility"" to act. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, meanwhile, warned of ""graver conditions"" if strikes are carried out against Syria. ""If any country attacks another when it wants, that is like the Middle Ages,"" he said. Who wants what after chemical weapons horror . Syria: Chemical weapons -- how did we get here? U.S. ruled out ground troops . For almost two years, Obama has avoided direct military involvement in Syria's bloody civil war as the death toll skyrocketed to more than 100,000, according to U.N. estimates. But Obama had warned that a chemical attack would cross a ""red line."" The White House previously ruled out sending ground troops to Syria or implementing a no-fly zone to blunt al-Assad's aerial superiority over rebels. Syria strikes could worsen war, analysts say . Brahimi said international law requires that that the Security Council approve military action. ""I do know that President Obama and the American administration are not known to be trigger-happy,"" he said. ""What they will decide I don't know."" Outside of the United Nations, a military coalition is taking shape among Western powers. France has also signaled it would join Western military intervention against forces supporting al-Assad. President Francois Hollande said France is ""ready to punish those who made the decision to gas these innocent people."" The French Parliament will hold a session next week to debate the situation in Syria. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron spoke by telephone Wednesday about the crisis. ""Both agreed that comprehensive use of poisoned gas against the Syrian civil population has now been proven sufficiently and that the Syrian regime has these corresponding poisons, the know-how for their use and the carriers to deploy them,"" according to a statement released by German spokesman Steffen Seibert. ""Both agreed this is a break in the already long ongoing internal conflict and that it cannot continue unpunished therefore an international reaction is inevitable. Both hope no member of the Security Council will close their eyes to this crime against humanity and that the corresponding consequences will be decided."" Britain's Parliament, meanwhile, is voting on a motion Thursday that would rule out any consideration of possible military action until the United Nations chemical weapons inspectors explain their findings to the U.N. Security Council. After the inspectors have made their findings, members of Parliament would be required to take another vote, according to the motion being put forward. Meanwhile, Iran is sending a delegation to Syria on Saturday to ""study the latest developments,"" the semi-official Fars News Agency reported Wednesday, citing a senior parliamentary lawmaker. The visit will examine ""Syria's conditions and showing support for the Syrian government and nation after the recent US threats,"" Seyed Hossein Naqavi Hosseini, parliament's national security and foreign policy commissioner, told the news agency.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN)   -- The sudden end to a legal battle between dethroned Miss California USA Carrie Prejean and pageant officials was prompted by the revelation of a ""sex tape,"" according to a source familiar with the lawsuits' settlement. Prejean was fired in June after lingerie-modeling photos of her emerged that pageant officials said were a breach of her contract. Prejean sued the pageant in August, arguing her firing was religious discrimination because of her opposition to same-sex marriage. Pageant officials countersued last month, demanding their former beauty queen repay $5,200 in pageant money spent for her breast implants and give them all proceeds from a book she's written. A settlement of both lawsuits was signed in New York Tuesday, but no details were made public. Lawyers and parties for each side were bound by a confidentiality pledge, according to the source. The veil of secrecy was partially lifted Wednesday after celebrity gossip Web site TMZ reported the deal was sealed after pageant lawyers presented an ""extremely graphic"" home video involving Prejean. TMZ Managing Editor Harvey Levin said during a webcast Wednesday that he obtained the Prejean video during the summer, but found it ""too racy"" to post on his site. He indicated Prejean was alone in the video. The source with knowledge of the settlement talks told CNN those details were accurate. Prejean's lawyer, Charles LiMandri, responded with a short statement issued through an employee at his law office. ""It's a confidential settlement, and he can't discuss it,"" the statement said. Several calls and e-mail to Prejean's publicist were not returned Wednesday. Prejean's tell-all book hits bookstores next week, and she is scheduled for media interviews to promote it. Pageant spokesman Kenn Henman said Tuesday the settlement means all lawsuit demands are dropped. The pageant had claimed that the contract she signed when she entered their competition last year gave the pageant the rights to anything she wrote. The settlement ended that claim. Pageant officials also dropped their attempt to be repaid for her breast enhancement, which was done before she represented California in the Miss USA competition, according to Henman. Prejean, in exchange, withdrew her suit accusing the pageant of violating her privacy by confirming to reporters that her breasts were enhanced, Henman said. ""We are moving forward from the past and looking towards the crowning of two winners and the new look of the upcoming Miss California USA pageant, telecast live on November 22,"" pageant Executive Director Keith Lewis said Tuesday. ""We're back in the business of beauty,"" he told CNN. There was nothing pretty about the public fight that began in April when Prejean, 22, stepped into controversy by declaring her opposition to same-sex marriage while answering a judge's question at the Miss USA pageant. Prejean finished as first runner-up. While state and national pageant officials publicly supported her initially, their opinions eventually changed after she continued to make public statements about same-sex marriage. She held onto her crown through May, despite a series of questionable photos that emerged on gossip Web sites. Those images showed a topless Prejean, photographed from behind. She was dethroned in June by Miss USA pageant owner Donald Trump amid growing complaints by state officials that she was uncooperative and not meeting her contractual obligations. Prejean filed her lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court in August, claiming that her firing was religious discrimination because of her stand against same-sex marriage. The pageant's countercomplaint said what it called Prejean's belligerent behavior, lack of cooperation and contract breaches caused her firing, not her opposition to same-sex marriage.","Carrie Prejean was dethroned as Miss California USA and sued pageant .

"The element of surprise was lost in a failed U.S. military raid to rescue two hostages being held by al Qaeda militants in Yemen, a senior Defense Department official said Saturday. American photojournalist Luke Somers and South African Pierre Korkie, a ""respected teacher"" who was to be released on Sunday, were fatally shot in the compound by a terrorist as the secret mission unfolded, a U.S. official said. The relief group Gift of the Givers, which was helping secure Korkie's release, had recently informed his wife that ""the waiting is almost over."" ""Three days ago, we told her 'Pierre will be home for Christmas,'"" said the group, which identified the South African hostage as Korkie. ""We certainly did not mean it in the manner it has unfolded."" He was an ""innocent man, a respected teacher,"" Korkie's wife, Yolande, said in a video made before his death. U.S. President Barack Obama ordered Friday's mission because ""there were compelling reasons to believe Mr. Somers' life was in imminent danger,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said. A video of Somers pleading for his life was released earlier this week by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. AQAP gave the U.S. three days to comply with unspecified demands. Time was running out. Arrangements for Korkie's release may have been missed by the White House. The Obama administration assessed that there were two individuals at the location but did not know one was South African or that negotiations were under way for his release, a senior State Department official told CNN. Korkie and his wife were abducted in May of last year, but AQAP subsequently let his wife go. On Friday, a team of local leaders was finalizing arrangements to reunite Korkie with his wife and children, the relief group said in a statement. Obama's decision . The President condemned AQAP's killing of the two hostages and explained his decision to authorize the rescue attempt. ""Earlier this week, a video released by his terrorist captors announced that Luke would be killed within 72 hours,"" Obama said in a statement. ""I also authorized the rescue of any other hostages held in the same location as Luke."" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement that the President had received a recommendation to authorize the operation. Obama offered his condolences to Somers' family. ""I also offer my thoughts and prayers to the family of a non-U.S. citizen hostage who was also murdered by these terrorists during the rescue operation,"" the statement read. ""Their despair and sorrow at this time are beyond words."" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation expressed its ""deepest condolences to the family and friends of Mr Korkie for their loss. Condolences are also conveyed to the family and loved ones of the deceased American hostage."" 'They lost the element of surprise' The operation took place Friday at 5 p.m. ET, a U.S. official told CNN. On Thursday, the Defense Department became aware of enough new intelligence about the location of the hostages to stage a rescue mission, the official said. A senior Defense Department official traveling with Hagel in Afghanistan said that the operation was accelerated because there was intelligence that Somers would be killed on Saturday morning, Eastern time. Obama and Hagel were briefed the next day. Two Osprey aircraft transported a team of about three dozen U.S. Navy SEALs, mainly from SEAL Team 6, and a combat medical team near the captives' location. There were no Yemeni forces with the U.S. commandos. The official traveling with Hagel said that once the Ospreys landed, the team had to trek about 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the compound. They were discovered about 100 meters from the location where Korkie and Somers were being held, according to that official. The main part of the assault lasted five to 10 minutes. ""They lost the element of surprise at the last minute as they approached the compound,"" the official said. It was not clear where the kidnappers were when the firefight started, but the official said that the U.S. is certain that someone ran back inside the compound and shot Korkie and Somers after the battle broke out. The official would not specify how it could be certain of that detail. Difficult, 'precision' mission . U.S. forces were on the ground for about 30 minutes, an official told CNN. They stayed for that length of time because the combat medical team was trying to stabilize the two wounded hostages. According to another official, the hostages were loaded onto a plane and flown to a nearby U.S. ship. One of the hostages died before reaching the ship. The other died afterward. Drones and fighter jets patrolled overhead during the mission. The U.S. forces that carried out the mission are safe, a U.S. defense official said. Both the President and Kerry praised their valor. The hostages were being kept at a location close to one where U.S. and Yemeni forces had carried out a previous raid. This rescue mission was particularly difficult, due in part to Yemen's sparse population, retired Lt. Col. James Reese, global affairs analyst for CNN, said Saturday. Reese noted that it would have been difficult for the military to travel a significant distance by air and still maintain the element of surprise in a rescue operation. ""It has to take precision,"" he said. ""This is like brain surgery."" A previous attempt . It was the second such attempt by U.S. forces in two weeks. In the first attempt, in November, U.S. and Yemeni special forces outfitted with night visors embarked on the mission about a few miles from a cave where AQAP was holding hostages. A gunbattle ensued, and the special forces killed all seven abductors and freed eight hostages. But the militants had separated Somers and four more hostages from the group and moved them to another location two days before the raid. This week, AQAP released a video threatening to kill Somers and showing the American photojournalist pleading for his life. A spokesman read a statement saying Somers would be killed if Washington did not meet the terror group's demands. The spokesman did not name the demands but said the U.S. government knew what they were. Pleading for his life . Somers' brother and mother posted a response video to YouTube in which they pleaded with the militants to spare him. ""He is not responsible for any actions that the U.S. government has taken. Please understand that we had no prior knowledge of the rescue attempt for Luke, and we mean no harm to anyone,"" Jordan Somers said. Paula Somers thanked his captors for taking good care of him, but also asked her son be returned to her alive. ""Please show mercy and give us an opportunity to see our Luke again. He is all that we have,"" she said. Tik Root, a former freelance journalist, met Luke Somers when they were both in Yemen. ""Of all the people I met in Yemen, Luke is certainly not the person that should have happened to,"" Root told CNN. ""He was passionate about the country, its people, and he was just a very thoughtful, quirky guy."" Root is now a desk assistant for PBS NewsHour, and he wrote about Somers on Saturday morning on NewsHour's website. ""I didn't know him particularly well but we did cross paths about a dozen times,"" Root said. ""He was really dedicated to Yemen.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lenny Dykstra, a three-time major league All-Star outfielder who played for the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies, was indicted Friday for bankruptcy fraud for allegedly selling items from his $18 million mansion in Ventura County, a federal prosecutor said. Lenny Kyle Dykstra, 48, of Murrieta, California, was charged with 13 counts: bankruptcy fraud, obstruction of justice, four counts of concealing property from the bankruptcy estate, three counts of embezzlement from the bankruptcy estate, and four counts of making false declarations to bankruptcy court, according to a statement from spokesman Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles. Last month, Dykstra was arrested and charged with bankruptcy fraud, and he was released on $150,000 bond and ordered to seek outpatient substance abuse treatment. The indictment is the result of conduct Dykstra allegedly engaged in after filing a bankruptcy case on July 7, 2009, Mrozek said. If convicted on all charges, Dkystra could face up to 80 years in prison, Mrozek said. After filing for bankruptcy protection, Dykstra allegedly ""looted"" his Sherwood Estates mansion in Thousand Oaks, California, lied about who stripped the mansion, and denied receiving money for having sold items that were owned by the bankruptcy estate, Mrozek said. According to court documents, an attorney hired by the bankruptcy trustee estimates that Dykstra stole and destroyed more than $400,000 worth of property in the estate. Among the property that Dykstra allegedly stole were silver- and gold-plated door knobs, gold fixtures, a grandfather clock, two desks, a chair, a Maitland-Smith dresser, chandeliers, electronic equipment, artwork, a stove and a framed piece of sports memorabilia about him, according to the indictment. The former member of a New York Mets World Series champion team was arrested last month on what police said was suspicion of fraudulent auto purchases. His attorney, Mark Werksman, characterized the case last month as ""a scorched-earth bankruptcy proceeding"" and blamed the auto-related accusations as a ""vendetta"" by former caretakers. But the U.S. bankruptcy trustee for the central district of California, Peter C. Anderson, described the allegations in Dykstra's case as ""egregious."" ""The bankruptcy-related conduct charged in the indictment constitutes an egregious abuse of the bankruptcy system and will not be tolerated,"" Anderson said in a statement. The 13-count indictment supersedes a criminal complaint filed last month, officials said. In the bankruptcy filing, Dykstra listed assets of $24.6 million and overall debts of $37.1 million. Among the assets he listed are two residences: a Ventura County mansion in Lake Sherwood Estates that he purchased from Janet and Wayne Gretzky, which he estimated was worth $18.5 million; and a home in Westlake Village that he estimated was worth $5.4 million. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, the residences and Dykstra's personal property became part of the bankruptcy estate that would be used to pay off creditors. Even though Dykstra was prohibited from liquidating any part of the estate, authorities alleged last month that he admitted in a bankruptcy hearing that he arranged the sale of sports memorabilia and furniture that were part of the estate. Dykstra's professional baseball career began in 1985 when he was drafted by the New York Mets at the age of 22. A year later, Dykstra hit a lead-off home run in Game 3 of the World Series at Boston's Fenway Park, after the Mets had lost the first two games. That spark rallied the Mets to a seven-game Series victory over the Boston Red Sox. He was traded in 1989 to Philadelphia, where the rest of his career was marked by successes as well as injuries, brawls and allegations of steroid use that he has denied. He earned the nickname ""Nails"" for his tenacity and confrontations on the field. By the time he retired, Dykstra had earned $36.5 million from major league baseball, according to the website baseball-reference.com. After retirement, Dykstra moved to California and started a profitable luxury car wash that he called The Taj Mahal. He expanded the business throughout Southern California and in 2007 sold it to investors, according to bankruptcy filings. As a self-taught financial analyst, Dykstra proclaimed himself a financial guru and began writing a stock-picking website column. His prominence soared as a sports celebrity, entrepreneur and popular guest on numerous financial news broadcasts. In 2008, Dykstra began publishing the Players Club, a glossy financial advice magazine exclusively for pro athletes to help them with wealth management and investment banking. His purchase of the palatial Gretzy estate in 2007 for $14 million occurred a few months before the mortgage market collapsed. By the time Dykstra filed for bankruptcy in July 2009, he had accumulated loans totaling $21 million, bankruptcy records show. The bankruptcy case is still ongoing. Dykstra has listed his only income as a $5,700 monthly pension from Major League Baseball, records show.","Lenny Dykstra was a three-time major league All-Star outfielder .

"(CNN)Despite all the difficulties facing the eurozone in 2015 -- slow growth, increasing debt and high unemployment to name a few -- small but lively Lithuania has taken the plunge and adopted the euro, swapping its lita for the single European currency at the stroke of midnight on January 1. The rebellious former Soviet republic was the first to declare independence from Moscow 25 years ago and hasn't looked back since. Now the country is a vibrant mix of east and west Europe. So what are some of the best ways to keep that new currency from burning a hole in your pocket? We've compiled a list of 11 ways to spend it. Littera Book Store at Vilnius University . With its baroque arches and frescoed ceilings, the Littera Book Store looks more like the Bodleian Library than Barnes and Noble. Never judge a bookshop by its cover. Despite its grand location within the 16th-century Faculty of Philology, the interiors are actually very modern. The seemingly ancient artwork was actually painted in 1978 by graphic artist Antanas Kmieliauskas. Entry to the university costs one euro but the fee is normally waived for anyone intending to visit the book store. Good buys include ""Joseph and His Brothers,"" Thomas Mann's four-part masterpiece written from his summer house in Nida, which is now a museum dedicated to the writer. Cost: Approximately 25 euros . Littera Book Store, Universiteto gatve 5, Vilnius; +370 5 263 8877 . Rental bike tour of Vilnius old town . As winter turns to spring, flocks of bright orange bicycles not seen since fall return to line the streets of the capital. At just 3 euros for a two-hour ride, the city's bike-sharing plan is the best way to explore in the warmer months. Cathedral Square, under the gaze of Gediminas' Tower and the ivory belfry of Vilnius Cathedral, is a good place to start. There's a cycle path that follows the beautiful Pilies Street and heads through the old town, a UNESCO World Heritage site, before crossing the Neris River to explore the surrounding green hills. Cost: 3 euros for a two-hour ride . CycloCity Vilnius; +370  8 800 22008 . Museum of Ethno-Cosmology . Ethno-cosmology is all about understanding humankind's place in the universe. Depending on point of view, it's either a holistic approach to stargazing or a newfangled form of astrology. Unsurprisingly, this is the first museum of its kind and even for ethno-cosmology skeptics the extraordinary observatory, which looks like something dreamed up by H.G. Wells, is worth the visit. The quality of the stargazing experience depends on the weather, but having one of the largest public telescopes in Europe on hand certainly helps. Cost: Admission 2-7 euros . Museum of Ethno-Cosmology, Kulionys, Ciulenai eldership, Moletai district; +370 383 45424 . Hot air balloon ride over Vilnius . Ballooning is popular in Lithuania and a spectacular way to experience the country's landscape, from the lakes of Trakai to the dunes of the Curonian Spit on the Baltic coast. Vilnius itself is one of the few major cities in the world that allows balloons to fly over it. Balloons depart from the banks of the Neris in time for sunset over the red-roofed city. Cost:  85-110 euros per person . Balloon Tours: +370 652 00510 . Curonian Spit National Park . Neringa is a quasi-mythical place where the Baltic Sea coast meets the Russian border. The giantess who gave her name to the region is also credited with creating its most recognizable feature, the Curonian Spit. This wall of sand dunes is Lithuania's other UNESCO World Heritage site and traces a 98-kilometer arc from Klaipeda to Malinovka in Kaliningrad Oblast. The spit was actually formed 5,000 years ago by a retreating glacier that left a ridge of debris in its wake and sealed off the lagoon behind it. While wandering the windswept headlands, visitors should keep an eye out for chunks of raw amber, which regularly wash up on the Baltic seaside. Cost: 100 euros (approximately) for a private day trip from Vilnius . Curonian Spit National Park, Klaipeda Region . Ice-Blokart Sailing . The marriage of sled and sail has been popular in Lithuania since the 1930s. Border guards used them during the Cold War to move quickly and stealthily across frozen territory. Also known as ice yachts, these wind-powered sleds are capable of reaching speeds of 100 kmh thanks to low friction between runner and ice. Ice sailing is easier to master than its summer counterpart, so it's great for children and absolute beginners. During winter, tour parties run frequently across the frozen Curonian Lagoon from Nida to Vente Ragas. Cost: Blokart rental from 40 euros per hour in Nida . Baltic Adventure; +370 5 250 5831 . Trakai Island Castle . This iconic island castle was once the seat of power for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, at the time the largest state in Europe, which stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Grand Duke Vytautas completed the stone foundations, still visible today, at the turn of the 15th century in defiance of the Teutonic Knights. Long left in ruins, the castle was finally restored following WWII with the help of Soviet money -- normally hard to come by -- after once more defying a German invasion. Only half-an-hour's drive from the capital, the 200 surrounding lakes and 21 islands make Trakai the perfect lakeside retreat for Vilnians. Cost: Entry 6 euros . Trakai Castle; +370 528 53946 . Karaite culture and cuisine at Kybynlar . As Vytautas expanded the Grand Duchy, a back flow of people introduced new religions and cultures to the state, which was markedly tolerant for its time. The 383 Karaite families brought back from Crimea at the end of 14th century founded a small but significant community around Trakai. A branch of Turkic Judaism, only 60 followers are still local to Trakai, but their culture and cuisine has miraculously survived. The famous Kybyn savory pastries served at Kybynlar restaurant on the banks of Lake Galves are sought-after delicacies, as authentically Lithuanian as any Baltic fare. Canach, a pastry-topped broth in an intricate ceramic pot, is worth trying. Cost: 2 euros for Kybyn pastry, 6 euros for Canach . Kybynlar Restaurant, Karaimu str. 29, Trakai; +370 698 06320 . 'Lithuanian gold' Many legends surround Lithuania's most famous export. The most popular tells of the goddess Jurate who lived in a golden palace under the sea. Tragically, her home was destroyed by the gods after she fell in love with an ordinary fisherman, but the remains were washed ashore as golden gems of amber. Chunks of the fossilized resin typically formed 30 million years ago and can be crafted into everything from chess sets to violins, or sold as found. Amber is credited with healing the sick and warding off evil. Cost: Varies, anything up to 100,000 euros . Amber, Latviu str. 7, Vilnius; +370 5 272 4090 . Druskininkai Ski Arena . For a country with winters that last from November to March you'd think they'd have had enough of snow come April -- but for ski and snowboarding fanatics there's nothing worse than end of season slush. The solution -- build a massive indoor ski park. The Snow Arena opened in 2011 with three slopes catering to beginners and experts, and 2.5 hectares of runs kept at -2 Celsius all year round, making it one of the biggest in the world. And it's cheap. Cost: Day passes start at 16 euros for adults, 14 euros for under 18s. Druskininkai Snow Arena, Nemunas road 2, Village of Mizarai, Druskininkai municipality; +370 313 69699 . Basketball . Lithuanians like to joke that basketball isn't just their national sport but their nation's religion. Four of their countrymen dominated the USSR team that beat USA to gold at the 1988 Olympics and helped the newly independent national side ('the other dream team"") to an emotional bronze medal, four years later, against a Unified Team of former USSR states. Their fans are perhaps the most passionate for any sports team in the world. During world tournaments statues are dressed in replica uniforms; basketballs and hoops adorn every billboard and shop front in the country. Watching Lithuania play at home is an incredible spectator experience. The best place to see a game is Zalgiris Arena, Kaunas. Cost: Tickets range from 10 to 30 euros .

"(CNN)Journalist Martin Boudot was frighteningly close when terrorists stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo. ""At first, we just heard shots. We heard screams,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Boudot and his colleagues made a mad dash for the roof. They didn't know what to do. ""We knew that there were victims a few meters away from us, but there might be, you know, some explosives somewhere or maybe a third guy,"" Boudot said. They made their way to the offices of the satirical magazine once the shooting stopped. ""It was a slaughter. It was like a massacre,"" said Boudot. He saw the bodies of those killed in a meeting room. In total, 12 people were shot dead in Wednesday's attack, including a building worker, two police officers, eight journalists and a guest of the magazine. Those who survived were shell-shocked. ""They were just standing like, not zombies, but you know they were like standing and they didn't do anything,"" Boudot said. The journalist described the gunmen as professional, people who knew their way around weapons. It was a sentiment echoed by a doctor who helped treat the wounded and spoke with survivors of the attack. Dr. Gerald Kierzek said the gunmen divided the men from the women before opening fire. The shooting was not a random spray of bullets, he said, but more of a precision execution. The gunmen asked for specific people by name before killing them, the doctor said. French police were still looking for at least two suspects Wednesday night: Cherif Kouachi and Said Kouachi. Both are potentially armed and dangerous. Citing sources, the Agence France Presse news agency reported that a third suspect had surrendered to police. CNN has not independently confirmed whether that is true. Paul Moreira, another witness to the attack, knew many of the victims. ""The stairways were full of blood, and I saw heavily injured people,"" he told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront,"" including a friend he's known for more than 20 years who was shot in the legs. He also saw the doorman. ""The man that I would see every morning -- this grumpy guy that we liked and appreciated -- he was lying down in his blood. He was dead. ""They (the gunmen) wanted to go inside as quick as possible. He wasn't fast enough to open the door of the building and they shot him,"" Moreira said.","Journalist Martin Boudot, colleagues ran to roof when shooting started .

"Washington (CNN)The tea party's latest failed revolt against House Speaker John Boehner underscored one of the movement's biggest problems heading into the new Congress. They are rebels with no clear cause. It's an issue that's bedeviled the tea party since its inception in 2010: They lack a central planning organization, a structure and a long-term strategic vision. And Boehner, with a shrewd command of all three, was already flexing those muscles Tuesday, doling out early retribution to two lawmakers that opposed him by removing them from committee spots. Meanwhile, Rep. Tim Huelskamp speculated he wasn't awarded a subcommittee chairmanship because of his vote. Boehner signaled Wednesday that he could mend fences, by saying he's starting ""a family conversation"" with his critics. But the issue remains. Conservative lawmakers admitted after Tuesday's vote that they had no clear plan going forward. ""There's going to be a fight"" in response to Boehner's acts of retribution, promised Rep. Louie Gohmert in the halls of the Capitol Tuesday. RELATED: Boehner plans 'family conversation' with GOP foes . Gohmert had offered himself up as an alternative to Boehner for speaker. But when pressed on details, he said only: ""You don't win a fight by telling your game plan ahead of time."" Conservatives are still fuming that leadership has offered them no clear plan to tackle Obama's executive action on deportations or Obamacare. House leadership passed a spending bill last month that tackled neither, promising to address the immigration problem in February when funding for the Department of Homeland Security runs out. ""You know, the speaker said he was going to fight tooth and nail against the amnesty — are they really going to do that?"" Huelskamp wondered on Tuesday. But asked whether there may be another showdown between conservatives and leadership when DHS funding hits that deadline, conservatives were unclear. ""We'll have to see what's next,"" Huelskamp said. ""I don't know how [the DHS funding fight] is going to go down,"" said Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky conservative who voted for the second time against Boehner as Speaker. Although the coup attempt managed to organize the greatest opposition to a speaker seen in more than 150 years, its failure underscored the problems plaguing the party's conservative wing. It made clear they, too, are fractured, squabbling over best tactics and strategies. RELATED: Paris attack quickly becomes Washington funding fight . House conservative aides and strategists for outside groups that had been whipping votes against Boehner say the vote came apart at the last minute, was hastily planned and had no clear leader or purpose. In a scathing statement, South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, considered by many conservatives to be an easy vote against Boehner who ultimately in fact supported him, denounced the lack of organization behind the attempt. ""This was an effort driven as much by talk radio as by a thoughtful and principled effort to make a change. It was poorly considered and poorly executed, and I learned first-hand that is no way to fight a battle,"" he said. ""This coup today was bound to fail."" He and other conservatives who supported Boehner, in their explanations, indicated conservatives are coming around to the Washington way of giving a little to get a lot. ""I am all for fighting, but I am more interested in fighting and winning than I am fighting an unwinnable battle,"" Mulvaney said in his statement. House conservative Rep. Raul Labrador also seemed amenable to working with Boehner, rather than against him, in the new Congress. ""I think it is unwise to marginalize yourself when there is no chance of victory, which was the case today,"" he said. He added that Boehner ""assured me that he wants to change the way the House is run"" and ""asked for my help moving the House in a more conservative direction."" But others are pledging even fiercer fights to come. Indeed, many conservatives are still claiming Tuesday as a victory, certain that it's not only wounded Boehner but will turn up the heat on conservatives who unexpectedly supported him to stand strong on their values and commitments to voters in the next fight. Outside groups named more than a dozen lawmakers, including constant conservative stalwarts like Rep. Jeb Hensarling and some freshmen, like Georgia Rep. Barry Loudermilk, who campaigned on opposing Boehner as particular disappointments. But as conservative strategist Daniel Horowitz put it, they believe those conservatives' defections on the speaker vote means they won't have room to compromise on their values in the future. ""This improves our chances for wins in upcoming legislative fights, because now conservatives have no option but to fall in line,"" he said. RELATED: Another test for John Boehner .","Conservatives are being punished for their failed plot to oust John Boehner as speaker .
They're promising a fight, but have no clear plan for how to move forward .
Others are showing a new willingness to work with the Speaker ."
"For 67 years, the Virgin Mary Church has been a peaceful refuge for Shenouda El Sayeh, much like the Giza province village of Kafr Hakim where it rests and where he has lived all those years. But, as he swept its floors on Thursday, it was painfully obvious things had changed. The night before, a mob -- chanting against Coptic Christians such as El Sayeh and calling for Egypt to become an ""Islamic state"" -- had torched and looted the Virgin Mary Church. ""I didn't expect this to happen,"" El Sayeh said. He's not alone. Christians all around Egypt are cleaning up in the aftermath of a spate of attacks, which came on the country's deadliest day since the 2011 revolution that overthrew longtime President Hosni Mubarak. Bishop Angaelos, the Cairo-born head of the Coptic Orthodox Church in the United Kingdom, said he was told by colleagues in Egypt that 52 churches were attacked in a 24-hour span that started Wednesday, as well as numerous Christians' homes and businesses. Ishak Ibrahim, a researcher with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, told CNN he had confirmed attacks on at least 30 churches so far, in addition to the targeting of church-related facilities, including schools and cultural centers. Those churches reportedly set ablaze Wednesday included St. George Church in Sohag, a city south of Cairo on the Nile River. And the new day brought new attacks. Prince Tadros Church in Fayoum, which is southwest of Cairo, was stormed and burned Thursday night, according to the official Middle East News Agency. This and other attacks have been blamed by some on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement which backs recently deposed President Mohamed Morsy. Government efforts to clear the group's Cairo protest camps resulted in gruesome scenes in the capital: Egypt's health ministry says that at least 580 people were killed and more than 4,000 injured amid clashes involving security forces and Morsy supporters. Against this backdrop, it may be some time before it's established what group, if any, is behind the church attacks, and how coordinated this violence has been. Until then, Christians in Egypt are left to try to put things back together, as well as to attempt to make sense of what's transpired. As Dalia Ziada of the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies, told CNN: ""This is horrible to happen in only one day."" 'A very dangerous game to play' Egypt will have much to deal with if, and when, things do settle down. Once that happens, Angaelos says that a proper investigation of the church attacks should follow -- especially since, he feels, the sheer scale of incidents suggests they were orchestrated, rather than a byproduct of chaotic unrest. ""We would want the people who have done it to be brought to justice because I think they are trying to do something which is much more dangerous,"" he said. ""It's not just about burning churches, it's about burning churches to initiate a response that then spirals into even greater violence -- and that is a very, very dangerous game to play."" The targeting of churches and Christian properties was not unexpected, Angaelos said, given the tensions in Cairo and elsewhere and in light of escalating attacks on Coptic Christians in recent weeks. The growing threat led him last week to issue a statement warning of ""a very real risk upon the life of every Christian."" Pope Tawadros II, the church's leader in Egypt, also suspended weekly public events for fear of attacks on Christian congregations. But the warnings didn't prevent the violence, nor did security efforts to protect churches and Christian communities, according to Ibrahim. Said Angaelos, ""The ferocity and the speed with which it all happened ... was quite surprising."" Burning of books . A Bible Society of Egypt statement posted online Wednesday reported the ""complete burning and destruction"" of its bookshops in the cities of Assiut and Minia, in southern Egypt. ""Fortunately we were closed today, fearing such an attack, so none of our staff were injured,"" wrote Ramez Atallah, the society's general director. ""The attackers demolished the metal doors protecting the bookshops, broke the store windows behind them and set the bookshops on fire."" Other stores and parked cars on those streets were also destroyed, he said. ""It is important to underline that -- while some Christian properties have been the victim of this violence -- they are by no means the only ones targeted,"" Atallah said. ""This is an attack against the state by a violent minority in an attempt to destabilize the nation."" CNN iReporter Amir Beshay, from Cairo, helped draw up a list of Christian churches and properties reportedly targeted. On it are sites in Alexandria, Arish, Assiut, Beni Suef, Cairo, Fayoum, Gharbiya, Giza, Minya, Qena, Sohag and Suez. They include churches and schools, as well as homes and businesses belonging to Coptic Christians. CNN has not been able independently to verify the reports. Asked about the attacks on churches Wednesday, U.S. State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf said the United States was deeply concerned. ""We will continue speaking out against this and continue talking to all parties and all sides about renouncing this violence, about moving forward with a democratic process."" Daniel Sinclair, director of communications at Christian Solidarity Worldwide, said the group was ""deeply concerned at the unwarranted and continuing targeting of the Coptic community. We urge the government to ensure comprehensive security to all Egyptians, regardless of their religion."" Long history in Egypt . Egypt's Christian minority has been the target of a number of attacks in recent years. The bombing of a major church in Alexandria in January 2011 killed 21 people and sparked worldwide condemnation. The situation has only become worse since Egypt's popular revolution overthrew former President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, said Angaelos. ""In the past two-and-a-half years, we've had more deaths of people just because they are Christians than in the last 20 years,"" he said, adding that this had not triggered violent retaliation. He hopes for forgiveness and reconciliation among all Egyptians going forward, to help build a unified country. Christians have been in Egypt since the 1st century and were, for centuries, the majority. Some 90% of Coptic Christians still live in the country, he said, making up the largest Christian community in the Middle East. Angaelos puts the proportion of Christians in Egypt at 15 to 20% of the population. The CIA World Factbook says 10% of Egypt's population is Christian, while the Pew Research Center, which says firm numbers are hard to come by, puts the figure at about 5%. Back in Kafr Hakim, Atia Ghattas told CNN his family's houses were attacked on the same night the church was looted. There was incitement against the Coptic community through the mosques in the area, he said. Father Boktor Saad, of Kafr Hakim's Virgin Mary Church, said he believes that a small group of extremists were responsible for inciting groups to attack his church. But, he and other church staff said, not everyone participated, and some non-Christians prevented the situation in that village from getting worse. They credited moderate Muslims with putting out the fire at Virgin Mary, and halting further attacks on Coptic Christians' homes and shops.","A Christian church southwest of Cairo is attacked, state news says .

"(CNN) -- One day after joining more than a score of other women accusing Bill Cosby, famed model Beverly Johnson told CNN that the legendary comedian's reputation for such acts was a secret in Hollywood -- one she only wished she knew about 30 years ago. Johnson detailed her own story about Cosby in Vanity Fair on Thursday, claiming he drugged her during a meeting at his Manhattan residence in the 1980s. She said in that article -- and again Friday on CNN's ""New Day"" -- that she doesn't believe he sexually assaulted her then, but she yelled obscenities at him before he dragged her outside and put her into a taxi. As more women have come out against Cosby in recent weeks, many of whom say the comedian did rape them, Johnson said she began talking to people in the entertainment business about her own story. ""The response was, 'Oh yeah, we know he has been doing that for quite a while.' It was like, everyone knew,"" Johnson said. ""But people like myself, I most certainly wouldn't have gone to Bill Cosby's brownstone if I knew the reputation he had with assaulting women."" Bill Cosby facing litany of allegations . Including Johnson, at least 23 women have spoken out to various media outlets with accusations against Cosby. This number includes 20 who have spoken with CNN, spoken on camera about their allegations or been the subject of responses from Cosby's attorneys. CNN has reached out to Cosby's attorney Martin Singer about Johnson's allegation, but has not heard back yet. But overall, the comedian's camp has strongly and persistently denied these allegations. Johnson: All of American was a Cosby fan . Johnson burst onto the scene as a model in 1970s, becoming the first African-American woman to appear on the cover of American Vogue. But she was in a rough patch in mid-'80s, coming off a rough divorce that included a difficult custody battle, when her agent called to say that Cosby wanted her to audition for ""The Cosby Show."" Johnson said that -- as someone trying to get more roles as an actress -- she was ""very excited"" by the prospect of appearing on TV's No. 1 show headlined by one of the nation's most revered figures. ""There wasn't a bigger figure in the entertainment industry than Bill Cosby and I was a big fan,"" she said. ""I don't know anyone in white America or black America that was not a fan of Bill Cosby and 'The Cosby Show.'"" Johnson met up with Cosby, including one meeting in which she took her young daughter to Cosby's brownstone. ""He was very charming, very nice to my daughter and I,"" she recalled. ""He suggested that I come back in a couple of days to rehearse the scene in 'The Cosby Show.'"" Claims she cursed comedian . So Johnson did go back, this time alone. As she recalled to CNN, Cosby offered her a cappuccino and was ""very insistent"" she take it, promising that it would ""be the best coffee that I've ever had."" ""The first sensation was a little woozy, and so then I took another sip,"" Johnson said. ""After that second sip, I knew I had been drugged. It was very powerful, it came on very quickly. The room started to spin. My speech was slurred."" Steadying herself on Cosby, Johnson claimed she ""just kind of cocked my head, because at that point I knew that he had drugged me,"" and told him, ""You are a (motherf*****), aren't you?"" ""I knew that he had drugged me, and I wanted him to know that he had drugged me,"" she said. ""And the only word I could get out was (that expletive), and I kept saying it to him louder and louder."" Johnson admits her recollection at this point were hazy, though she remembered Cosby becoming angry, grabbing her by one arm, dragging her outside and flagging down a taxi for her. ""All I remember after I got into that taxi cab, and somehow telling (the driver) my address (was) saying, 'Did I just call Bill Cosby an MF?' I was concerned about him, rather than me."" Cosby a 'powerful man' in the industry . In the Vanity Fair article, Johnson wrote that she tried a few days later to call Cosby on a private number so he could ""come clean and explain why he'd done what he had."" Cosby's wife, Camille, answered the phone. When Johnson asked to speak to Cosby, Camille told her it was late and they were in bed. Johnson said she'd call back, but never did. Talking to CNN about why she didn't go public then with her story, Johnson explained that she was drugged but didn't think she was sexually assaulted and also spoke of beinging ashamed of speaking out. The fact the man she'd be accusing was Bill Cosby also factored in. ""(He was a) powerful man in an industry that I would like to be a part of,"" she said. ""That went through my mind."" In her live interview with CNN, Johnson said she didn't ""want to see anything happen to Bill Cosby"" by sharing her story. What she does want -- besides showing solidarity with other Cosby accusers, like her longtime friend Janice Dickinson -- is for her speaking out to encourage others who have been the victims of sexual assault by any perpetrator to speak up. ""This, to me, is not about Bill Cosby. This, to me, is about violence against women,"" Johnson said. ""... What I want to see happen is that women come out and speak their truth.""","NEW: Johnson: Everyone in ""white America"" and ""black America"" were Cosby fans .

"Paris (CNN)Marchers raised pens skyward. They lit candles in the dark. They wrote ""liberty"" and ""free expression"" on placards in rallies that came hours after a terror attack killed 12 people Wednesday in Paris. As the initial shock wore off, the grand boulevards in most of France's major cities became scenes of mourning and solemn demonstrations, with crowds declaring themselves unbowed by the gunmen's assault on the offices of the magazine Charlie Hebdo. Four of its cartoonists were among those killed in the gunfire. ""The world has become so sick that (being a humorist or cartoonist) has become a dangerous profession!"" said a poster carried by one woman in a mass of protesters in Paris' Place de la Republique. One mourner, Corentin Vacheret, described the slain cartoonists as journalists who ""are famous in France, especially among people who value the liberty of expression."" ""The fact that they were killed in the most insane circumstances is just sickening,"" Vacheret said. ""I am not a fan of big protests, but I wanted to express that we are not afraid, that this is not going to make us renounce our liberty of expression."" Rallies also unfolded Wednesday night in Tours, Toulouse, Brest, Lyon, Rennes and Poitiers, among other cities in France, long regarded as a cradle of democracy and liberty. They were joined by demonstrations elsewhere in Europe, including London, Barcelona, Berlin and Rome. The most immediate rallying cry against the attack was ""Je Suis Charlie,"" or ""I Am Charlie,"" in reference to the weekly satirical magazine's title, Charlie Hebdo. Another sign at the rally in Place de la Republique declared: ""I stand up and I express myself with words because they are still the most beautiful weapon!"" According to Le Monde newspaper, French police said as many as 15,000 people gathered in the Place de la Republique, which was closed to traffic. Demonstrators' candles glowed in the darkness. Marchers were mostly silent for the first hour, Le Monde reporter Maxime Goldbaum tweeted, but then began chanting, ""Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!"" and ""We are Charlie!"" At another point, the chant became a play on words: ""Charlie-Charlie-Charliberte!"" One student held a sign at the Paris rally saying, ""Long live liberty! Long live France! Long live Charlie!"" Another student, Sacha, told Le Monde newspaper, ""We didn't just come here because of the emotion, but because of the principle. Liberty must be defended."" Sruthi Gottipati of Paris posted a photograph on her Twitter page of someone lighting a flare at the foot of the monument at Place de la Republique, becoming a mirror image of the nearby statues holding torches. Another photograph showed several people in the crowd holding aloft a series of illuminated letters in the darkness that stated in English: ""NOT AFRAID."" Just a few feet away from the main demonstration, the gathering took a more sombre tone. Dozens of people created a shrine of pens and pencils on the paving stones, encircled by tealights and candles. Many visitors -- some in tears -- stood or sat quietly, with heads bowed, appearing as if they were trying to understand what happened in an office a few streets away. Faycal Haddad, a Muslim, carried a homemade sign stating ""not in my name, not in the name of my religion."" ""I don't want anyone to say that my kids, someone from my family, is involved -- this is not Islam,"" Haddad said. ""If I thought that this was what Islam was about, I would not be part of it. No religion in the world can authorize anyone to kill. ""We need to unite against these few people, they are a bacteria, a virus, and we need to find a solution,"" Haddad added. He joined the public outpouring on the spur of the moment, straight from work, without telling his wife or kids, he added. ""I felt it was my job to be here,"" he said. He was planning to bring his family to the protest planned for Saturday in Paris, he said. Luc Lemoine carried a cartoon of his own making showing a dramatic faceoff between two characters: a masked terrorist with a gun and a balding man with a pencil. ""The drawings never killed anybody,"" Lemoine said of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists. ""Like everybody, I was shocked about what happened. Everybody here grew up with Charlie Hebdo. It is part of French culture and has been for many years, so I felt it was important to be here,"" Lemoine said. Emmanuel Leger brought his son Binhkim, 15, to a vigil where both held burning candles. ""I think today is the day everything changed,"" the father said. ""I am an artist, I draw, but just for pleasure, and sometimes my drawings are not politically correct,"" Leger added. ""I wanted my son with me, even if he didn't want to come, I'm sure in several years he will remember this time."" Parisians used social media to urge people to attend the Place de la Republique vigil, which drew a crowd whose numbers reached several thousand. At times, the gathering was silent, but at other moments, many individuals chanted ""freedom of expression"" loudly. Participants laid down flowers and lit candles in the cold night. By 10 p.m., the crowds began to thin. In London, about 700 people gathered at Trafalgar Square in an evening vigil for the French victims. Many condemned the attackers. ""Shame on you, pens versus gun? There's no competition, is there. Shame on you, shame on you,"" said one man attending the London event. ""It's the most cowardly thing you can do."" CNN's Bryony Jones and Fred Pleitgen contributed from Paris. Michael Martinez wrote this report from Los Angeles.","Slain cartoonists are called famous journalists in France .

"(CNN) -- The United States has adopted numerous measures to make itself safer since al Qaeda slammed planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Hundreds of billions of dollars spent to improve security and strengthen intelligence capabilities. More security for travelers. After nearly a decade, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden is dead, killed early Monday in Pakistan by U.S. special forces, officials said. But is the United States any safer today than it was on September 10, 2001? Experts mostly believe -- some strongly, some tentatively -- it is. But, they caution, by no means is it time for the nation to relax its guard. ""I think it's a mixed bag,"" said Amy Zegart, an associate professor at UCLA's School of Public Affairs who served on the National Security Council under President Bill Clinton in 1993. ""... We're never safe. The question is, are we moving in the right direction? The answer is yes, but we have a long way to go."" ""There's no question about that -- much safer,"" said Thomas Kean, former New Jersey governor and chair of the 9/11 commission, which investigated the attack and issued recommendations. ""But not safe enough. We've still got some work to do. There are new threats. We need to adjust to those threats."" There has not been a large-scale terror attack on the United States since 9/11. There have, however, been some foiled attacks -- the attempted bombing in Times Square last year, for instance, or the attempted Christmas Day 2009 bombing on a flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit. There also have been successful attacks, such as the November 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, in which 13 people were killed and dozens of others wounded. Two U.S. senators found that FBI and Army officials repeatedly ignored multiple warning signs, including the suspect's ""radicalization to violent Islamist extremism"" and his reported communications with a suspected terrorist, according to a February report. The alleged gunman, Army psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Hasan, reportedly communicated via e-mail with radical Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. ""I think we're safer in terms of al Qaeda central,"" said Tom Fuentes, a CNN contributor and former FBI assistant director. U.S. military actions in Afghanistan forced al Qaeda to go further underground, he said, and reduced both bin Laden's and al Qaeda's effectiveness in carrying out ""the big attacks."" ""You've had instead the splinter groups start doing the other types of attacks,"" he said, eventually getting to the point where ""they'll do anything they can do"" -- attacks like the Times Square plot, for instance, which aim to kill one to 100 people rather than thousands. But, he said, Americans are vulnerable to those smaller attacks. ""You're always going to have the lone wolf, the psychopath, whether it be al Qaeda or others,"" Fuentes said. Faisal Shahzad, the would-be Times Square bomber, was linked to the Pakistani Taliban. But John Brennan, assistant to the president for counterterrorism and homeland security, said at the time of Shahzad's arrest that group, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban, or TTP -- is ""closely allied with al Qaeda."" While the United States has made strides in preventing a would-be terrorist from coming into the country, homegrown terrorism remains one of the biggest threats the nation faces, Kean said. ""We have to have a mechanism to deal with that,"" he said. ""I think we're absolutely safer, but it's more than just the killing of bin Laden, "" said Frances Fragos Townsend, CNN national security contributor and homeland security advisor under President George W. Bush. While ""nothing is perfect,"" the United States has closed many of its vulnerabilities, she said. Even something as simple as buying large amounts of fertilizer now raises red flags, making it much more difficult for would-be terrorists. In addition, law enforcement and surveillance authorities are more aggressive and able to uncover plots much earlier, she said. Without question, the nation's security and intelligence capabilities are much stronger than they were before the 9/11 attacks, and have effectively prevented such an attack from happening again, said Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst. The 9/11 conspirators, he pointed out, would never be able to conduct the same kinds of actions today as they did pre-9/11 -- getting into the United States, taking flight lessons, wiring money overseas -- without catching authorities' attention. Their command and control centers -- in Germany, where a cell in Hamburg is believed to have planned the 9/11 attacks, as well as Afghanistan and Pakistan -- either no longer exist or have been severely crippled. ""Their ability to do that kind of attack is close to zero,"" Bergen said. ""... These groups retain some capability, but they're under tremendous pressure."" At the time of the 9/11 attacks, 16 people were on the U.S. no-fly list, Bergen said. That number is now in the thousands. Air travelers face increased security and scrutiny at airport checkpoints, and must remove their shoes at the checkpoints because of another failed bombing attempt, in December 2001. Before 9/11, the FBI and CIA didn't share information regularly, and the United States did not focus on overseas intelligence cooperation as it does today, Bergen said. The CIA's budget has doubled, Townsend said, and the number of case officers increased. The United States' intelligence relationship with Saudi Arabia, for instance, is ""as productive and as strong as our relationship with the British, which was not the case 10 years ago,"" Townsend said. Those countries understand our enemies better than we do, culturally and operationally, as they live in the same neighborhood, she added. Kean said, ""We're talking to each other now much more."" The nation's 17 intelligence agencies were ""silos"" before 9/11, he said. ""Our targets are certainly harder than they were before,"" Zegart said. ""Intelligence is better coordinated."" But, she points out, that bar was low before 9/11. ""We were caught flat-footed. ... We had nowhere to go but up."" One of the most dangerous issues still facing the United States is the fact that a common radio frequency has not been set up for first responders, Kean said. On 9/11, as the World Trade Center towers began collapsing while New York firefighters were inside trying to save people, police had no way to warn them, he said. The same thing was seen during Hurricane Katrina, when ""people in the boats couldn't talk to people in the helicopters."" He said it's hard for him to believe that, nearly a decade after 9/11, a communications spectrum for first responders does not exist. In a sense, al Qaeda has also contributed to its own downfall, Fuentes said. ""Between 80 and 90% of the people who have been killed by al Qaeda are Muslims. That's really caused them to lose a lot of support in Muslim countries themselves."" In addition, nations like Saudi Arabia and Yemen have lost any tolerance they may have had for al Qaeda and are not offering them anything resembling a safe haven, he said. The to-do list for the United States remains long, Zegart said. On it are tasks such as defining the role -- and the power -- of the director of national intelligence, as well as those of the so-called ""fusion centers,"" aimed at coordinating federal, state and local law enforcement. ""We've got to carry the ball forward. We cannot think that the threat is gone."" ""I think this is a critical juncture,"" she said. ""It was before Osama bin Laden's death and even more so today."" Figures like al-Awlaki continue to pose a threat, she said. Also, there is still no proper oversight of intelligence agencies, Kean said. Some 80 congressional committees oversee the Department of Homeland Security, he said, and ""instead of protecting us, (officials are) always testifying."" ""The killing of bin Laden, yes, it makes us safer,"" Townsend said. ""We've denied our enemy the inspirational leadership, the architect of the doctorate of al Qaeda. ... Does it mean the war's over? No. Does it mean there's still a threat? Absolutely. But it's a crippling blow.""","Experts believe the U.S. is safer today than before September 11, 2001 .
But they say the nation still faces threats that are very real .
Much remains to be done, says a former National Security Council member ."

"When Guy Scott takes the reins in Zambia, he'll become the first white African President in sub-Saharan Africa since apartheid. Scott became vice president  three years ago. His boss, President Michael Sata, died Tuesday while undergoing treatment for an unknown illness in London. Zambia's constitution requires fresh elections within 90 days. Until then, Scott, who is of Scottish descent, assumes interim presidency. It's unclear, however, whether he can run for President in the elections.  The nation's constitution says a candidate's parents must have been born in Zambia; his were not. Scott makes history . Scott was born in 1944 in Livingstone, Northern Rhodesia, which later became Zambia after independence from Britain. Shortly after his graduation from Cambridge University and University of Sussex with a degree in economics and a doctorate in cognitive science, he returned home and worked for the finance ministry. He later took a break from the ministry and ventured into wheat and strawberry farming.  But politics wooed him back in in 1990, when he was elected to chair the nation's agriculture committee. ""Dr Scott's participation in Zambian politics was inspired by his late father, who was an ally of Zambian nationalists and a founder of anti-colonial government newspapers including the African Mail, now the Zambia Daily Mail,"" a profile on his party website says. His father was a member of parliament for the capital of Lusaka before independence. Before joining Sata's opposition party, which became the ruling party three years ago, he briefly left politics to focus on his agricultural business. His new position will put him in the history books. South African President Frederik de Klerk was the continent's last white President. His party lost to Nelson Mandela's African National Congress in South Africa's first multiracial, fully democratic elections in 1994. De Klerk took a deputy position in the new government for two years.","Guy Scott will be first white African President in sub-Saharan Africa since apartheid .

"(Budget Travel) -- Holiday travelers are filling up flights, and flu season is in full swing, so it's more important than ever to protect yourself against illness. We dug deep to identify the major germ zones on planes (and tips to avoid them). No, you're not likely to contract meningitis, but better safe than sorry, right? GERM ZONE: Water   FOR: E. coli, a common culprit behind stomach cramps . Your plane reaches 30,000 feet, the fasten-seat-belt sign switches off, and the flight attendant comes by to take your drink order: Coffee or tea? Ice water? They seem like innocent offers -- until you consider that airplane water has been under review by the EPA for traces of E. coli for six years. A random sampling of 327 unnamed domestic and international aircraft caused a stir in 2004 when some water samples tested positive for E. coli, one strain of which is the leading cause of food poisoning in the U.S. Coffee and tea are brewed on board with such water and don't typically reach hot enough temperatures to kill E. coli. When bottled water runs out, some planes have been known to fill fliers' glasses from the tank. One British Airways crew member confessed to the London-based Times that, in those cases, the crew first has to wait for any cloudy ""floating stuff"" to settle out. And onboard tanks are small to limit their weight, so planes sometimes refill at foreign airports, where water standards can be questionable. The encouraging news is that water quality and control are improving: From 2005 to 2008, only 3.6 percent of samples tested positive for coliform bacteria, of which only a small fraction tested positive for E. coli. And in October 2011, the EPA's Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, with more standardized, stringent disinfection and inspection regulations, will go into effect. TIP: Once you clear the security checkpoint, purchase a bottle of water to bring on board. When the flight attendant comes to take your order, stick to soda, juice and other prepackaged liquids, minus the ice. While ice cubes are usually supplied by an outside vendor, some large planes may have their own ice-making capabilities -- reliant on tank water. Budget Travel: 10 scenic airport landings . GERM ZONE: Seat Pocket  FOR: Cold and influenza A, B, and C viruses . There's a familiar routine to settling in on a plane: Store your luggage in the overhead bin and deposit any personal items you want to be readily available in your seat pocket. But reaching into that pocket is akin to putting your hand in someone else's purse and rummaging among their used tissues and gum wrappers. Toenail clippings and mushy old French fries are even nastier surprises that have been found in seat pockets. Consider that cold and influenza viruses can survive for hours on fabric and tissues, and even longer (up to 48 hours) on nonporous surfaces like plastic and metal -- and you realize that you might pick up more than that glossy flight magazine when you reach inside. TIP: Bring a small, easily accessible carry-on bag so that you can avoid stashing things in the seat pocket. If you must use it, keep magazines and other items within a plastic bag for protection. GERM ZONE: Tray Table  FOR: MRSA, a deadly superbug . Flight attendants have witnessed many repulsive misuses of the tray table, from parents changing dirty diapers to kids sticking their boogers underneath. Research confirms that the handy tray table is a petri dish for all kinds of health hazards, including the superbug Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), which is often fatal once contracted. It kills an estimated 20,000 Americans annually. In 2007, University of Arizona researcher Jonathan Sexton tested tray tables from three major airliners, and an alarming 60 percent tested positive for the superbug. That's quite a revelation considering only 11 percent of his samples from the New York subway found traces of the bug. TIP: Bring disinfectant wipes to clean off your tray table before and after use, and never eat directly off the surface. CDC guidelines tell you what to look for in a disinfectant and recommend checking a product's label to see if MRSA is on the list of bacteria it kills; Lysol disinfecting wipes is one reliable choice. And be sure to protect any cuts with Band-Aids -- the most common way of contracting an MRSA infection is through open skin. Budget Travel: The coolest gifts for every traveler . GERM ZONE: Airplane Meal  FOR: Listeria, a microbe known to cause gastrointestinal illness and meningitis . In-flight meals have long had a bad reputation for consisting of bland, barely identifiable dishes. Then, in 2009, the meals made headlines when FDA inspections of the Denver location of LSG Sky Chefs -- the world's largest airplane caterer with clients including American Airlines, Delta and United -- found the kitchens crawling with roaches too numerous to count and employees handling the food with bare hands or unwashed gloves. Test samples from the food preparation area also found traces of Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause gastrointestinal illness and meningitis, as well as cervical infection in pregnant women. Your likelihood of contracting illness from the microbe is very low, though it should be noted that one fifth of the 2,500 annual cases are fatal. LSG Sky Chefs, to its credit, responded accordingly after the news broke and passed the FDA's follow-up inspection in January 2010. TIP: It sounds like LSG has cleaned up its act, but you'll never really know where your meal has been. If you're concerned, eat beforehand and bring your own snacks onto the plane. Check out our article on how to make a sandwich that will still be appetizing once you're in the air. For starters, choose a well-cured meat like prosciutto or salami. GERM ZONE: Airplane Pillow and Blankets  FOR: Germs like Aspergillus niger that cause pneumonia and infections . Talk about sleeping with the enemy. You're snuggling with a blanket and pillow that have likely been used by many drowsy, drooling passengers before you. Unless visibly soiled, pillows and blankets are often reissued because of the frequency of flights. A 2007 investigation by The Wall Street Journal revealed that airlines cleaned their blankets every five to 30 days. And don't assume your blanket is new just because it's wrapped in plastic. The Union of Needletrades, Industrial, and Textile Employees made a big stink in 2000 when it accused Royal Airline Laundry -- which supplies pillows and blankets to clients like American, United and US Airways -- of repackaging pillows and blankets without cleaning them properly. Its research found blankets with traces of Pseudomonas paucimobilis, known for causing lung and eye infections, and pillowcases with Aspergillus niger, which can lead to pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleeding. In the decade since, airlines like Southwest and Alaska Airlines have removed pillows and blankets completely, while JetBlue, US Airways and American now charge for them. TIP: There have been no documented reports linking airlines to these infections. But if you're worried about staying warm -- and want to avoid potential germs and airline fees -- wear layers and thick socks, and consider bringing Grabber Warmers, small disposable hand and foot warmers. A travel pillow and compact blanket will help you sleep in comfort. Budget Travel: See the pyramids . GERM ZONE: Airplane Lavatory  FOR: A smorgasbord of threats like E. coli or fecal bacteria . After a mid-flight nap, you wake up to nature's call and must face the airplane's biggest germ zone: the lavatory. With hundreds of people using the commode daily, the small boxy space is a natural haven for all kinds of germs and viruses, especially on the door handle (do you really think every passenger washes his or her hands?). And that thunderous volcanic toilet flush doesn't exactly help the situation, spraying water and releasing potential germs into the air every which way. The CDC cited the lavatory as a major danger area for the spread of disease during the H1N1 flu and SARS epidemics. TIP: Use a paper towel to close the toilet lid before flushing -- and then leave without washing your hands. Remember that cloudy tank water we described above? The sink water comes from the same source. You'll come away cleaner if you skip the sink and reach for hand sanitizer instead. Get the best travel deals and tips emailed to you FREE - CLICK HERE!

"Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told a CNN reporting team Friday that it could continue reporting in the South American country, a day after the government revoked or denied press credentials for CNN journalists. Earlier, Maduro had said he would expel CNN if it did not ""rectify"" its coverage of anti-government protests. During a news conference aired live on state-run TV, Maduro reversed his early position, saying CNN could stay. Following the more than two-hour news conference, officials told CNN that its journalists would be issued credentials to report within the country. It was a bizarre end to the news conference that saw Maduro call out CNN, Fox News and other U.S.-based media, claiming they encouraged opposition forces against the government. ""Where is CNN en Español. There they are. ...They do not talk about anything except Venezuela. One hundred percent of the programming until today has been Venezuela. No other Latin American news but Venezuela,"" Maduro said. ""...They're calling for civil war, hatred and are lying to the world about what is happening in Venezuela. This comes back to the owner of CNN. He is the one who sets the guidelines. And they work with the State Department, and from there they use that network to foment a pretend war among Venezuelans and to say internationally there should be intervention in Venezuela."" Maduro called on CNN to rectify its reporting. ""I know they want to stay in Venezuela. Do it. Cover Venezuela. Cover it in a balanced way. When they call you and say report THIS, find a balance,"" he said. ""A balance based on respect for Venezuelan laws. He who does not respect the laws will not be on Venezuelan airwaves."" CNN correspondents Rafael Romo and Karl Penhaul, and CNN en Español's Osmary Hernandez were often shown prominently in cutaway shots during the state TV broadcast. During the broadcast, Maduro invited a question from Penhaul, who asked about the status of an investigation into the theft of CNN's television equipment at gunpoint this week. The crew had been covering an anti-government protest when they were robbed. Maduro assured Penhaul the incident was being investigated. ""We expect that you will be able to go with the loss recovered,"" Maduro said. Anti-government protests have become a daily occurrence in the country, and clashes with security forces or pro-government supporters have resulted in at least eight deaths, officials said. In a televised speech on Thursday, Maduro said CNN was not showing ""the people working, studying, building the homeland."" ""Enough war propaganda. I do not accept war propaganda against Venezuela. If they do not rectify things, get out of Venezuela, CNN, get out,"" Maduro said, to applause from his pro-government audience. ""Fuera! Fuera!"" people in the crowd shouted -- ""Out! Out!"" Hours later, government officials notified seven journalists for CNN International and CNN en Español that their press accreditation had been denied or revoked. CNN teams from outside Venezuela were told to book flights back to their home countries. Maduro described CNN's journalists with some of the same adjectives he uses for his political opponents. ""A group of fascists with their aggressions want to take us away from peace,"" Maduro said. ""They are not going to do that. And we are going to show them."" When members of the CNN International team were told their credentials were denied, they were asked several times when they would be leaving the country. While the journalists were asked to leave, CNN International and CNN en Español continue to broadcast in Venezuela. CNN has repeatedly asked for a meeting with officials. ""CNN has reported both sides of the tense situation in Venezuela, even with very limited access to government officials,"" CNN said in a statement, adding that at the time its credentials were revoked, CNN was seeking an interview with the president. ""We hope the government will reconsider its decision. Meanwhile, we will continue reporting on Venezuela in the fair, accurate and balanced manner we are known for."" A top legislative leader for the ruling party said the government will investigate the allegations against CNN, and will not ""tremble in acting against those who make an attempt against the motherland."" The move to revoke CNN's press credentials comes after weeks of protests that mark the largest demonstrations Maduro has faced in his 11 months in power following the death of President Hugo Chavez. Government authorities and opposition leaders have blamed each other for deaths resulting from the violence. Leopoldo Lopez, an opposition leader in Venezuela, faces arson and conspiracy charges in connection with the unrest. Lopez, who has denied the charges, is being held in a military prison outside Caracas. Venezuela also expelled three U.S. diplomats this week, accusing them of conspiring to bring down the government -- an accusation that the State Department has repeatedly denied.","President Nicolas Maduro says CNN can stay in the country and report .

"(CNN)Nicole Kidman appeared on ""The Tonight Show"" on Tuesday with a story so awkward, it made Jimmy Fallon hide under his desk. It turns out that Kidman and Fallon had met once before years ago but haven't seen one another since. As these things go, the two of them have totally different memories about what happened during their meeting: Kidman thought she was going to ""hang"" with the star, but Fallon was totally oblivious. ""I don't know if you remember this, but we met before,"" Fallon told Kidman. ""Oh, I remember,"" Kidman replied. ""Yeah, you tell your version (of the story)."" Fallon remembers walking around New York when he got a call from a friend named Rick, who tells him that Nicole Kidman wants to meet him. ""Maybe to be in 'Bewitched' or something like that,"" Fallon recalls. But according to Kidman, their meeting had nothing to do with a movie. ""I just remember that I liked you,"" she tells a bewildered Fallon. ""Rick, our mutual friend, says, 'oh, Jimmy wants to meet you, and you can go over to his apartment. ...' And I'm single, and I'm like, 'OK, yeah, cool.' "" Apparently, Fallon had no idea that this was supposed to be a romantic setup. ""What? Did I date Nicole Kidman?!"" Fallon asked. If he did, he didn't do it well. Kidman made her way to Fallon's apartment, only to find the comedian in ""a baseball cap and, like, nothing."" ""You wouldn't talk,"" Kidman went on. ""And then you put on a video game or something, and I was like, 'this is so bad.' "" At that point in Kidman's story, Fallon fled for cover under his desk. But Kidman wasn't done: ""After about an hour and a half, I thought, 'He has no interest. This is so embarrassing. And then I left and (thought), 'OK, no chemistry. Maybe he's gay?' "" she said with a laugh. Fallon swears he had ""no clue at all"" that he could've dated Kidman, but as the Australian actress says, it just wasn't meant to be. Kidman went on to marry country star Keith Urban in 2006, and Fallon wed movie producer Nancy Juvonen in 2007. Both stars now have kids. ""I can't believe I dated Nicole Kidman!"" Fallon said. ""This is one of the most awkward moments ever.""","Nicole Kidman revealed that she and Fallon had met before .

"(CNN)Whether they're hanging inside prestigious art hotspots, such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, or in the houses of Elton John and Richard Branson, the thought-provoking creations of Kudzanai Chiurai have captivated audiences across the world. Aged just 31, Zimbabwean-born Chiurai is one of the fastest-rising talents in the contemporary African art scene. His arresting body of work is increasingly defined by the use of mixed media, as Chiurai combines paintings and drawings with videos and photographs to address issues such as democracy and xenophobia. But for some, Chiurai is much more than an artist. He has been described as a poet, an activist and a cultural philosopher who uses his striking -- and at times dark -- creations to tackle the political and social issues that are close to his heart. ""You can't escape politics,"" explains Chiurai, who lives and works in South Africa. ""Everything's political in the sense like how we're socialized."" Read more: Africa's answer to the New Yorker . A trained painter, Chiurai was the first black student to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in fine art from South Africa's University of Pretoria. He started his career painting landscapes and portraits but his activism soon started appearing in his work. He stirred up controversy during the build-up to Zimbabwe's violent and disputed 2008 elections with a series of controversial depictions of president Robert Mugabe. Chiurai's posters, which showed Mugabe in flames with horns on his head, raised the ire of Zimbabwe's ruling elite and got Chiurai into trouble. The young artist says he was threatened with arrest and has been living in self-imposed exile ever since. Although he knew the implications of criticizing one of Africa's most feared strongmen, Chiurai remained unfazed. He describes the hardships that many of his countrymen were suffering amid a deepening economic crisis in the once-prosperous southern African country. ""Art has always played an important role in telling these stories,"" he explains. ""Whether it's through painting or posters; whether it mirrors a thought or it mirrors an idea; whether it mirrors a conversation that should be had. I thought that, in that instance, it was possible to do that in one image."" The series of posters galvanized Zimbabweans living in South Africa to speak out against what was happening in their country. Inspired by British street artist Banksy, Chiurai also used stencils and spray paint to create outdoor murals depicting the fear of elections in Zimbabwe and xenophobic attacks in South Africa. Read more: Graffiti art targets Kenyan 'vultures' Chiurai's work about the political situation in Zimbabwe turned him into a poster boy for the country's new struggle, while some compared him to Chinese artist Ai Weiwei for daring to stand up his country's leadership. ""With every generation you always want to be the generation that contributed something,"" he says. ""I always say if there's a vacancy in history, you should apply for it ... So for me it was that -- the poster boy thing sort of came as a result of that but then for me it was like I wanted to do something, I thought that was important."" But the recent defacing of a controversial painting of South African president Jacob Zuma and violent demonstrations in Tunisia over what some have branded religiously offensive art have many questioning whether artistic expression is being suppressed in parts of the continent. Chiurai sees it as the re-emergence of artistic activism. He says that this is something the world needs more of. ""It is very important for the average person to have a voice out there,"" he says. ""So it's more important now than ever."" Chiurai's latest installation, ""Conflict Resolution,"" is currently being shown in one of the world's most esteemed art displays: the Documenta 13 in Kassel, Germany. For ""Conflict Resolution,"" he combined a series of narrative mediums to make art accessible to a new generation of Africans -- a group he says no one tries to talk to. ""We're almost kind of left to our own devices and we're raised by YouTube, or we're raised by DStv"" he says. ""They are like our pseudo family, these sort of multimedia spaces, like bloggers have become brothers and sisters to random people."" Through his art, Chiurai says, he wants to spark a conversation with the youth of the continent. ""Being able to find a way to communicate with people -- and beyond just writing within a blog space or within live TV -- if it's in some way engaging to them, I think you have sort of started a conversation with them because it's within a language they understand. So it makes the communication easier."" Being born a year after Zimbabwe's independence, Chiurai is part of what is known as the ""Born-Free generation"" on the African continent. He says that some young Africans are beginning to realize the influence and power they hold. ""They underestimate their capabilities and abilities to be able participants in change and the direction of politics,"" he says. ""Some are starting to see that and acknowledge that. We are in a position where we can change or contribute something. We are in a position where, as a 'Born-Free generation,' we won't be forgotten.""

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's supreme leader is attempting to extinguish an annual event celebrating the last days of winter and the Persian calendar year, and the government is strengthening its security presence in the days leading up to a major holiday, Iranian media reported. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday urged Iranians to dismiss the ancient practice of fire jumping and feasting on Chaharshanbe Soori, a festival held on the eve of the last Wednesday before spring -- this year, March 16. The activities date back thousands of years. The festivities have no basis in Islam, and can cause ""harm and corruption,"" Khamenei said in a statement published by Iranian news sites. ""It is appropriate to avoid it,"" he said. The celebrations lead up to Norooz, the holiday that marks the first day of spring and the Persian new year. Norooz falls on Saturday this year. Iran is beefing up security to ensure ""order and calm"" during the two-week period celebrating Norooz, stationing 200,000 security personnel across the Islamic republic, according to Raja news, the official new site of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In the eastern city of Mashad, the chief prosecutor said those who engage in ""disruptive behavior"" during Chaharshanbe Soori would face ""strong consequences."" It's a precaution that's become increasingly commonplace in Iran, especially in advance of holidays, as the government continues to warn against political demonstrations that have emerged since last summer's disputed presidential elections. Most recently, the Iranian government quashed anti-government protests that brewed in February as the nation commemorated the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, which marked the end of the country's Western-backed monarchy and the start of an Islamic republic. In the days that led up to the February 11 holiday, the government mobilized security forces and heightened its warnings, saying it would arrest protesters and hold them until the April 9 end of Norooz. Six protesters who were arrested in December on the Muslim holiday of Ashura were sentenced to death on Monday, the day before Chaharshanbe Soori, the semi-official Fars news agency reported Monday. Their sentences are being reviewed by an appeals court, Fars said. And some 350 inmates at Evin prison have gone on hunger strike to demand that their cases be examined before Norooz, saying their ward is so overcrowded with recent political arrestees that prisoners are in poor health, according to the Committee of Human Rights Reporters, an Iranian group. There were also reports that opposition leader Mehdi Karrubi's home was vandalized. Karrubi's Eetemade-Melli (National Trust) party's Web site, called Saham News, said a group had gathered in front of his house and tossed red paint on the walls of the apartment building. Two weeks earlier, a similar group threw tomatoes and eggs at the building, the Web site said. A video identifying a vandalized apartment building as Karrubi's was posted on YouTube Monday, showing exterior walls scrawled with the last names of Karrubi, fellow opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi and former President Mohammad Khatami -- all reformists. In some areas, the black spray paint read ""death to Karrubi"" and ""death to Khatami."" Anti-government demonstrations began after the disputed June 12 presidential vote, which re-elected hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over main opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi. Eyewitnesses in Iran said thousands of riot police and security officers lined the streets of the capital, Tehran, and patrolled major intersections on motorcycles and on foot Monday night. Beginning Saturday, police also set up checkpoints along major roads in Tehran, and vehicles have been stopped and searched from late at night into the early morning hours, witnesses said.

"(CNN) -- MGM Resorts defended its safety practices Wednesday after amateur video surfaced showing a lion attacking its trainer inside its habitat at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada, as horrified visitors to the hotel looked on. The trainer was treated and released from the hospital after the incident earlier this month, MGM Resorts spokesman Gordon Absher said in a statement Wednesday. The video shows two trainers along with a lion and a lioness inside the habitat -- a popular attraction at the hotel that opened more than 13 years ago. At first, the lions appear relaxed, lying down as the trainers stand nearby. The male lion then shifts his body weight and looks at the trainer nearest to him before the camera turns its focus to the other lion and second trainer. Gasps are then heard from onlookers and the video reveals the male lion wrestling with the trainer closest to him. With help from the other trainer, the man gets away, even as the lion appears to continue to stalk him. Dave Salmoni, a big cat expert for Animal Planet, told CNN's ""Rick's List"" on Wednesday that the lion appeared to try to show his dominance over the trainer after the man ""stiffened"" when the animal turned his gaze on him. ""What that tells the lion is: that guy's nervous,"" Salmoni said, adding that the lion interprets that nervousness into a need to dominate. ""He went over and was doing what I would consider to be like a teenager testing his boundaries,"" he said of the lion. ""He went in and said, 'I know I'm not allowed to bite people but I'm going to bite you and see what you can do back to me.'"" ""It was definitely him saying, 'I'm the boss here,'"" added Salmoni, who survived a similar attack by a lion. MGM's Absher defended the lion habitat in his statement Wednesday, saying the handlers ""uphold the highest safety standards at all times."" The lions are provided to the hotel by Keith Evans, a contracted animal expert, and live at an off-site ""desert compound,"" according to Absher. ""The animals are displayed on rotating shifts at the habitat, just one day per week,"" he said. ""Incidents where animal handlers are bitten are very rare,"" Absher said, adding that the trainer ""is in good health and anxious to return to work.""","A trainer was bitten in the leg by a lion at the MGM Grand exhibit .

"Who is Kenneth Bae? And why is he being held by North Korea? Those are the questions for many following the combative exchange Tuesday between Dennis Rodman and Chris Cuomo on CNN's ""New Day,"" who asked whether the former NBA player was planning to inquire about Bae, a U.S. citizen sentenced to 15 years in a North Korean labor camp. In response, Rodman, who is in North Korea with a team of fellow former NBA players, suggested the Korean-American had done something wrong, but did not specify what. ""Do you understand what he did in this country?"" Rodman asked Cuomo. ""No, no, no, you tell me, you tell me. Why is he held captive here in this country, why?"" Here's a look at the case: . Who is Bae? Born in South Korea, Bae immigrated at age 16 to the United States with his parents, his mother told CNN. The 44-year-old Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, moved to China in 2005. A year later he established ""Nations Tour,"" a China-based tour company that specialized in tours of North Korea, according to his family and freekennow.com, a website established by friends to promote his release. Described by his sister, Terri Chung, as a devout Christian, Bae is married and the father of three children. ""Several years ago, Kenneth saw an opportunity that combined his entrepreneurial spirit with his personal convictions as a Christian,"" the website said. ""He believed in showing compassion to the North Korean people by contributing to their economy in the form of tourism."" Bae had guided at least 15 tour groups, mostly made up of Americans and Canadians, into North Korea at the time of his arrest, his family has said. What happened? This much everybody appears to agree on: Bae was on the first day of a five-day tour when he was arrested November 3, 2012, in Rason, an area along the northeastern coast of North Korea that has been established by Pyongyang as a special economic zone to promote trade and investment. U.S. officials have struggled to establish how exactly Bae ran afoul of North Korean authorities. Word of Bae's arrest first surfaced in South Korea media reports days after he was detained, with the United States later confirming it. Nearly two weeks after detaining Bae, North Korea's official news agency confirmed his arrest, saying only he was picked up for a crime against the state. According to the state-run Korean Central News Agency, KCNA, there was evidence uncovered that proved he had committed a crime against the country. Among the allegations: Bae was setting up bases in China to topple the North Korean government;  he was encouraging North Korean citizens to bring down the government; and he was conducting a ""malignant smear campaign."" In May, the government also accused Bae of planning a ""Jericho operation"" to bring down the government through religious activities. The American confessed to the offenses, the government said. What did he do? There has been speculation the evidence North Korea cites may in fact have been something Bae was carrying with him, perhaps a Bible or some other religious literature. His mother, Myunghee Bae, who visited her son in North Korea in October, told CNN that her son was a devout Christian who had not understood the North Korean system. North Korea is officially an atheist state. Bae's health . North Korea is considered to have one of the most repressive penal systems in the world. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 200,000 people are being held in a network of prison camps that the regime is believed to use to crush political dissent. His mother and sister have told CNN that more than 10 months into Bae's sentence, his health is failing. In a prison interview with Choson Sinbo, a pro-North Korean group based in Tokyo, Bae had spoken of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver and a back problem. He looked noticeably thinner and wore a blue prison garment streaked with sweat and dirt. ""Although my health is not good, I am being patient and coping well,"" he said at the time. ""And I hope that with the help of the North Korean government and the United States, I will be released soon."" Bae was moved to a hospital for serious health problems, his sister told CNN in August. In previous interviews, Chung has said that her brother suffers from health problems including severe back and leg pain, kidney stones, dizziness, blurred vision and loss of vision. He was already dealing with diabetes. His family says he has lost more than 50 pounds. Bargaining chip? The timing of Bae's conviction has raised questions about whether Pyongyang is using him as a bargaining chip in efforts to jump-start negotiations to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program. Washington has previously accused North Korea of doing so to try to gain concessions. Bae's conviction followed North Korea's testing of a long-range rocket and an underground nuclear test, moves that resulted in tougher U.N. sanctions. Tensions between North Korea and the United States have eased somewhat since the spring, when Pyongyang unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats as U.S. and South Korean troops carried out large-scale military exercises in the region. U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korea to release Bae. In August, the two countries appeared close, but North Korea rescinded an invitation to a U.S. envoy. Ambassador Robert King, President Barack Obama's special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, had been expected to fly to Pyongyang to try to win Bae's freedom. In previous instances, North Korea has released Americans in its custody after a visit by some U.S. dignitary -- in recent cases, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. But efforts by Bill Richardson, the former ambassador to the United Nations, were unsuccessful in winning Bae's release during a visit to North Korea last year. Even Rodman, at one point, called on North Korea's Kim Jong Un to release Bae. ""I'm calling on the Supreme Leader of North Korea or as I call him ""Kim,"" to do me a solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose,"" Rodman said in a May 7 post to his Twitter account. Rodman's rant . Rodman's rant garnered swift reaction, with Richardson telling CNN the basketball player ""crossed a line this morning by implying that Kenneth Bae might be guilty, by suggesting there was a crime."" White House spokesman Jay Carney said he had heard about Rodman's outburst. ""I did not see some of the comments that Mr. Rodman made, but I am not going to dignify that outburst with a response,"" Carney said. But the harshest criticism of Rodman came from Bae's sister, Chung. ""We couldn't believe our ears. He was in a position to do some good and help advocate for Kenneth, and refused to do so,"" Chung said on AC360. ""But then instead he has chosen to hurl these outrageous accusations against Kenneth. He clearly doesn't know anything about Kenneth, about his case. And so we were appalled by that.""","Kenneth Bae's sister says Rodman was in a position to do some good and refused .

"(CNN)A brutal attack Wednesday on the offices of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo -- famous for its blistering cartoons -- left 12 people dead. In the aftermath of such cowardice, we in free Western societies have to ask ourselves: What kind of world are we going to live in? And will we allow these intolerant radical Islamic bullies to decide for us what we can read and what we can't? As an editorial cartoonist working in a small Southern town in America, it might have been easy for me to feel insulated from attacks thousands of miles away. But we live in a global society, and this attack hit me on a very personal level. I was fortunate enough this past fall to travel to Paris, and also to a little town called St.-Just-le-Martel in the countryside, where locals throw an annual bash celebrating France's long love affair with the art of cartooning, illustration and caricature. It's a wonderful event, and it's clear that the French love their cartoonists and their art. They crowd in by the hundreds to meet the artists and to maybe get their caricatures drawn. It was there that I met one of the victims in Wednesday's attack, cartoonist Georges Wolinski. From what I gathered, he was something of a rock star in France. Like all the artists there, he was funny, pleasant and gracious with his time, and his death, along with 11 others, is beyond appalling. The reality is that this is not just an attack on Charlie Hebdo, but an attack on all of us who hold dear freedom of expression, no matter where we live. Charlie Hebdo is irreverent, anti-religious and occasionally vulgar. The writers and cartoonists routinely anger many of its readers. Back in 2007, for example, it reprinted the Prophet Mohammed cartoons that were first published in a Danish newspaper, illustrations that had outraged the Muslim community. And in 2011, Charlie Hebdo ""invited"" Mohammed to be guest editor and showcased a caricature of him on the cover. Since then, it has been reported that several of the editors and cartoonists have lived under the constant threat of death. Yet for every cartoonist I have ever met, the occupation is more than a job: It is a lifelong obsession. And while I have never considered this obsession that I share to be a life-threatening career, it is hard to escape the fact that this is now the world we live in, one where hooded gunmen kill journalists and cartoonists in cold blood because they are angered by printed words and drawings. So, how do we respond? It would be much easier -- and safer -- to simply shut up, put the pen down and walk away. The editors and cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo certainly could have done that at the first sign of trouble. Stephane Charbonnier, the editorial director and one of the cartoonists, for example, was under special high-profile protection, according to The Daily Telegraph, which quoted the publication's attorney as saying, ""The threats were constant. It was frightening."" Yet Charbonnier persisted, refusing to give in to fear. And in the end it cost him his life. Opinion: Cartoonists, killed for their art, and humanity . How that can be so is bewildering. We should be focusing on issues like beating hunger and poverty. Yet despite the remarkable technological advances of Western civilization, we find ourselves engaged in a clash with extremists stuck in the seventh century, bent on oppressing women and imposing suffocating religious views on the rest of the globe. Our freedoms are at risk, plain and simple, and we must all decide how we will respond. For my part, I will go back to my drawing board and try to make sense of this ridiculous, senseless and vicious assault on my friends and colleagues an ocean away. Under constant threat of death, Charbonnier was quoted in the French newspaper Le Monde as saying, ""I would rather die standing than live on my knees."" That seems like a good place to start.","Rick McKee: As a cartoonist, the Paris attack hurt on a personal level .

"(CNN)If the King had lived, he would have been 80 on Thursday. For Henrik Knudsen, this year brings another significant anniversary worth celebrating. Twenty-five years ago, he decided to quit his job selling power tools to become Denmark's only professional Elvis Presley fan. ""I was a sales agent for a long time and I decided I didn't want to be that anymore. I thought, imagine if I could be a full-time Elvis fan,"" he says. ""I knew it was a big leap but I felt like I just had to do it. And a few years later I was."" Even by the obsessive levels of fandom still inspired by the defining entertainer of the 20th century nearly four decades after his death, Knudsen takes his duties seriously. He's sitting in a diner booth in the replica of Elvis Presley's Graceland mansion he's built on the outskirts of his hometown of Randers in central Jutland. ""We get a lot of Norwegians stopping off. If not for the memorabilia, then for the food,"" says Knudsen. Elvis sandwiches . There are not, it has to be said, too many other dining options for the bequiffed Nordic trucker with a penchant for blue suede shoes, fresh off the ferry from Stavanger and hungering for a peanut butter, jam, banana and bacon sandwich -- the diner's tribute in cholesterol to its hero's all-American appetite. Like the ebullient Knudsen, Graceland Randers is larger than life. From outside, the neo-classical entrance, guarded by stone lions, and green shutters are unmistakable, but it's twice the size of the Memphis original where Elvis lived from 1957 until his death in 1977. As well as the diner, the mansion houses Knudsen's $1.6 million-valued collection of memorabilia -- instruments and outfits, plus more idiosyncratic items such as cufflinks given to Elvis by U.S. President Richard Nixon, and a baseball glove he used while serving as a soldier in Germany. The collection also features a photo of Denmark's current Queen Margrethe and other Scandinavian royals meeting Elvis during a visit to Hollywood in 1960. ""That's a great piece, because you can talk about it to Danes, who are very proud of their queen, and to Americans because they like royalty,"" Knudsen says. The shop is a treasure trove for vinyl collectors. A casual browse uncovers exotic albums from the former Yugoslavia, India and Japan, and a Dutch rarity featuring alternate tracks by Elvis and swivel-hipped 1980s Welsh wonder Shakin' Stevens. 'All in good taste' Downstairs in the museum, ""Aloha from Hawaii"" -- Elvis's seminal satellite broadcast from 1973 -- plays on a perpetual loop, while Graceland Randers also broadcasts ""Always Elvis,"" a 24-7 radio station available via a smartphone app astutely summed up by one reviewer as ""brilliant if you like Elvis."" Knudsen's personally led tours and boundless enthusiasm are a big part of the attraction. ""In 1972 I became an Elvis fan, and I was 13 when he died,"" he says. ""For me it started with the music. It's hard to explain. I listened to all kinds of music back then and still today but there is nothing that catches my interest like Elvis."" Disappointingly for more morbid-minded Elvis obsessives, there's no replica of the upstairs bathroom suite where he famously left the building for the final time, with the first floor instead serving as a function room. ""We realize we are on a thin line here,"" explains Knudsen. ""Is it tacky? Is it cool? Is it a joke? Most people who come here get it. We think we have done this in good taste."" Knudsen hit on the idea of building a Danish Graceland in 2006 when he saw a replica of Sun Studio during a visit to Nashville. By then he'd been successfully staging exhibitions since 1993 and was looking for a permanent home for his expanding collection. ""I wondered how much it would be, and thought maybe five million kroner ($822,000). I contacted an architect -- I knew his wife was an Elvis fan and that was why I dared even call him. ""We went to Memphis to see the real thing. And when we came home he did some drawings and said 'It's not five million kroner, it's 20 million.'"" Birthday treat . Backed by local business and civic leaders, the house opened at an eventual cost of 26 million kroner ($4.27m) in 2011 and now draws almost 120,000 visitors a year.

"(CNN)A woman who accused college football star Jameis Winston of raping her in 2012 filed suit Wednesday against Florida State University, alleging the school violated her rights under Title IX. The woman, under the name Jane Doe, alleges the school ""in concert with Tallahassee Police, took steps to ensure that Winston's rape of plaintiff would not be investigated either by the university or law enforcement."" FSU also failed to adequately respond when she became the target of harassment and hostility, she says. ""FSU's responses to the harassment were clearly unreasonable,"" says the suit, which doesn't specify damages the woman is seeking from the school's board of trustees. Florida State President John Thrasher said in a written statement that the university never shirked its responsibilities. He called the lawsuit without merit. ""In all, the university asked the plaintiff or her attorneys at least nine times over nearly 20 months to give a statement that would enable a Title IX investigation,"" he said. ""FSU's handling of this matter was driven by the plaintiff's deliberate and informed choice on how to proceed, not by athletics."" Winston, the 2013 Heisman Trophy winner as the best collegiate football player that season, was not arrested after a criminal investigation by Tallahassee Police and a state prosecutor. He was also cleared during an FSU hearing last month into whether he violated the student conduct code. The case began in December 2012 when the woman, then a student at the Tallahassee university, reported she had been sexually assaulted. A month later she accused Winston, whom she recognized in one of her classes, of rape. Winston has said the sex was consensual. Winston isn't named as a defendant in the latest legal maneuver. On Wednesday, he announced he will leave the FSU football team early and make himself available for the NFL draft, where he is expected to be a top pick. Bleacher Report predicted Winston will be the second selection overall. The woman still has the option to file a civil suit against Winston. In her suit against the university, she alleges that for 11 months the school did ""nothing to investigate the plaintiff report of rape while the FSU Athletics Department continued to keep the incident a secret."" The court document says the school talked to Winston about the allegation for the first time after Florida State won the national championship game in January 2014. It says: ""Winston refused to answer any questions and FSU again let the matter drop."" Title IX requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual assault, even if criminal charges are not filed. FSU said in October that Winston informed the athletics department of the allegation after he was contacted by a Tallahassee Police detective a month after the incident. The university said the athletics department did not initially file a report with the school's Title IX administrator because no charges were filed and because other players who were with Winston said there was no sexual assault. It also said in a letter to the FSU community that since the incident happened in an off-campus apartment, the Tallahassee Police had jurisdiction. ""The university takes sexual assault very seriously. The university is also cooperating fully with the U.S. Department of Education investigation into this matter,"" FSU said in its letter. The woman asks in her suit for a trial by jury.","Winston says the sex was consensual; woman says she was raped .
She claims university tried to stifle any investigation into football player's actions .

"Dozens of residents in northeastern Nigeria have been killed in two separate attacks launched by Boko Haram Islamists, according to officials and residents. Scored of Islamist insurgents dressed in military uniforms stormed the Christian farming village of Izghe, in Borno state, late Saturday and opened sporadic fire on residents, killing at least 106 people in an attack specifically targeted at male residents. The gunmen, who arrived in the village riding in trucks and on several motorcycles, opened fire and hacked male residents they had assembled in the village square. They moved door to door in search of male residents who were hiding. The attack prompted an exodus of hundreds of panic-stricken residents of nearby villages to the neighboring Madagali district in Adamawa state. ""We suspect that the gunmen were members of Boko Haram. They have taken over the village,"" said Madagali local government chairman, Maina Ularamu.. The attackers looted businesses and food stores ""and loaded all their spoils into vehicles owned by residents and fled into the bush,"" said Ularamu. A survivor of the attack, farmer Barnabas Idi, said he scaled the fence of his house and crawled for about 40 minutes to safety. Idi said that security agents were not present during the attack. In the second attack early Saturday, suspected Boko Haram gunmen opened fire on Doron Baga, a fishing village along Lake Chad. ""They opened fire from all directions, forcing residents to jump into the lake in a bid to escape, and many drowned while others were gunned down,"" said Babagana Gwoni, a survivor of the attack. The gunmen looted fish and foodstuffs before setting houses on fire, Gwoni said. Lt. Col. Mohammed Dole, a military spokesman, confirmed the Doron Baga attack but declined to give details. ""We received report of the attack on Doron Baga, but we don't have details because the area falls under the operational jurisdiction of the Multinational Joint Task Force,"" Dole said. The Multinational Joint task Force comprises troops from Nigeria, Niger and Chad and was set up in 1998 primarily to fight light weapons proliferation. Its mandate has been expanded to include combating the Boko Haram insurgency.","Boko Haram kills at least 106 people in an attack targeted at males, officials, residents say .

"Nigeria defended its response to the kidnapping of hundreds of schoolgirls by the terror group Boko Haram, even as details emerged Tuesday about a second mass abduction, adding to a growing global outrage over the fate of the children. President Goodluck Jonathan has been under fire over accusations the government initially ignored and then later downplayed the abduction of the girls, who have become the focal point of a social media campaign demanding their safe return. ""The President and the government (are) not taking this as easy as people all over the world think,"" Doyin Okupe, a spokesman for Jonathan told CNN. ""We've done a lot  -- but we are not talking about it. We're not Americans. We're not showing people, you know, but it does not mean that we are not doing something."" In detailing the government's response, two special battalions have been devoted to the search for the missing girls, Okupe said. That includes 250 locations that have been searched by helicopters and airplanes. It was unclear whether these were additional troops being dispatched or were forces already in place. More troops, he said, are also on the way. But the father of two of the schoolgirls taken by Boko Haram told CNN there has been no sign of the military in the days and weeks following the abduction. He accused the government of ""playing"" with the parents of the missing girls, treating them as ""fools."" ""Had there been these military men who went into the bush to rescue our daughters, we would have seen them,"" said the father, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals by the government and the terror group. ""...We have never seen any military man there."" U.S. offer of military help . In a sign that Nigeria may be bowing to international pressure and outrage, the government announced the creation of an information center dedicated to answering questions and providing daily updates about rescue efforts, Okupe said. Nigeria's President also accepted an offer of U.S. military support in the search for the girls. ""So what we've done is — we have offered, and it's been accepted — help from our military and our law enforcement officials,"" U.S. President Barack Obama told NBC News on Tuesday. ""We're going to do everything we can to provide assistance to them."" That help includes the creation of a ""coordination cell"" to provide intelligence, investigations and hostage negotiation expertise, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. The cell will include U.S. military personnel, she said. The joint coordination cell will be established at the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Abuja, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the work is expected to begin immediately. But even as the help was offered to Jonathan, new details were emerging about the abduction of at least eight girls between the ages of 12 and 15, who were snatched Sunday night from the village of Warabe. The village is located in the rural northeast, near the border of Cameroon, an area considered a stronghold for Boko Haram, a group that U.S. officials say has received training from al Qaeda affiliates. Villagers in Warabe told CNN that gunmen moved from door-to-door late Sunday, snatching the girls and beating anybody who tried to stop them. The latest abductions come amid international outcry over the April 14 kidnapping of more than 200 girls. According to accounts, armed members of Boko Haram overpowered security guards at an all-girls school in Chibok, yanked the girls out of bed and forced them into trucks. The convoy of trucks then disappeared into the dense forest bordering Cameroon. Boko Haram: A bloody insurgency, a growing challenge . 'Western education is sin' Boko Haram translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language, and the group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. The United States has branded Boko Haram a terror organization and has put a $7 million bounty on the group's elusive leader, Abubakar Shekau. In recent years, the group has stepped up its attacks, bombing schools, churches and mosques. But it is the abductions of girls that has spawned the biggest outrage, with a #BringBackOurGirls campaign that initially began on Twitter and then quickly spread with demonstrators taking to the streets over the weekend in major cities around the world to demand action. 6 reasons why the world should demand action . On Tuesday, the United Nations human rights chief blasted Boko Haram, saying the group's claim of slavery and sexual slavery of girls are ""crimes against humanity."" ""The girls must be immediately returned, unharmed, to their families,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a news release. 'I abducted your girls' A man claiming to be Shekau appeared in a video announcing he would sell his victims. The video was first obtained Monday by Agence-France Presse. ""I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah,"" he said, according to a CNN translation from the local Hausa language. ""There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women. I sell women."" In the nearly hourlong, rambling video, Shekau repeatedly called for an end to Western education. ""Girls, you should go and get married,"" he said. Pillay, along with three other African United Nations women leaders, sent a letter reminding the Nigerian government of its ""legal responsibility to ensure that girls and boys have the fundamental right to education and to be protected from violence, persecution and intimidation,"" according to her statement. In the United States, all 20 women serving in the Senate signed a bipartisan letter calling on Obama to take action. ""More can be done by this administration. I would like to see special forces deployed to help rescue these young girls. Some of these girls are as young as nine years old,"" Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told CNN. ""...They're being sold into slavery, forced into marriages, required to convert. This is just horrible."" More than 355,000 people, including celebrities and lawmakers, to date have signed a change.org petition that calls upon the world to act to save the girls. The petition calls on Jonathan and the government ""to ensure all schools are safe places to learn, protected from attack."" 'You can never rule out surprise' Nigerian Minister of Information Labaran Maku told CNN that despite international reaction and media reports, there have been some successes in combating Boko Haram. But when asked about bombings in Abuja, which came the same day as the mass abduction of schoolgirls, he said: ""In the case of insurgency and guerrilla warfare, you can never rule out surprise here and there."" He also declined to agree that misinformation released by the military in the aftermath of the April kidnapping added to the growing outrage. First, the military said all the girls had been released or rescued. But after the girls' families began asking where their daughters were, the military retracted the statement. ""When they made that statement, it was based on a report they received,"" the minister said. Nigeria's finance minister said Monday that her country's government remains committed to finding the girls but should have done a better job explaining the situation to the public. ""Have we communicated what is being done properly? The answer is no, that people did not have enough information,"" Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told CNN's Richard Quest.

"(CNN)Facebook has reunited siblings separated at birth, rekindled old romantic relationships and helped countless people find someone who understands what they are going through. And now, the social media platform has helped one Tennessee family find a home for their unused embryos, according to CNN affiliate WSMV. Angel and Jeff Watts of Mount Juliet, Tennessee struggled to conceive and turned to in vitro fertilization, which they say blessed them with two sets of twins, ages 3 years old and 16 months. The couple was then left with six unused frozen embryos, which they decided to donate and place with the National Embryo Donation Center in Knoxville, WSMV reported. Separated at birth, reunited on Facebook . But two years later, the embryos were still unused and being housed at the donation center. ""What I didn't realize is that there's a lot of competition out there,"" Angel Watts told WSMV in an interview. ""That center has over 300 sets"" of embryos, she said. Each set could be anywhere from one embryo to 24 embryos per donor, said Stephanie Wood-Moyers, marketing and public relations manager for the National Embryo Donation Center. ""The more restrictions, stipulations that the donors place on the recipients, the longer it's going to take to find a match,"" she said. The average wait time for open communications arrangements such as the one Watts was seeking, where the donor has contact with the recipient, could be anywhere from six months to four years, she said. Frustrated and eager to find a home for her embryos, Watts went an unconventional route. She placed a post on Facebook, and detailed the kind of family she and her husband were looking for: married several years, in a steady loving relationship, strong Christian background, roots in Tennessee. ""And I made sure I let people know, you know, this is not a gimmick, no games,"" said Watts. ""I'm not getting any money for this."" The Watts received hundreds of responses, and in less than three weeks settled on a family: Rayn and Richard Galloway of Cookeville, Tennessee. ""We don't look like what people would statistically say 'Oh those people are infertile.' We just look like a happy, young married couple,"" said Rayn Galloway in an interview with WSMV. Don't believe this Facebook hoax . Rayn said she stumbled upon the post and jumped at the possibility. She recently visited with Angel Watts and her family. ""Meeting them and seeing their children and seeing how they interact as a family, their interests, just their personalities as a whole, is very similar to my husband and I,"" she told WSMV. Angel Watts said she wants her kids to know the Galloway family because they will be genetically connected forever. ""We'll be meeting them all along so they'll know us but they won't know us as parents,"" said Watts. Rayn, who plans to have two transfers of three embryos each, with the first transfer possibly by May, said she agrees with Watts on the importance of an open relationship. ""Those are her babies, and she is giving me that gift,"" said Galloway. ""The least that I can do is let her have a relationship, see those children and have a relationship for her own children's sake."" After IVF shock, mom gives birth to two sets of identical twins . Wood-Moyers of the National Embryo Donation Center said there are few laws in most states in the entire country that cover embryo donations in any form. ""It's a little bit of uncharted territory,"" she said. That is why fertility doctors say counseling for anyone going through open donations is crucial so that both families can share their needs, wants and expectations. ""If it works and people are careful, it will work well,"" Dr. Glenn Weitzman of the Nashville Fertility Center told WSMV regarding this unorthodox path of embryo donation. ""That's part of our generation and our new age, our ability to communicate and communicate with a wide range of people on our own without having to go through what might be considered normal channels."" Do you think using Facebook to find a home for unused embryos is a good idea?

"(CNN)Iron Man, step aside. Captain America, take a breather. Women are taking over. Tuesday night's premiere of ""Marvel's Agent Carter,"" which drew ecstatic reactions on social media, is just the latest example of more action series and films featuring women. In years past, we had shows such as ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" and ""Alias,"" but lately it seems like female action heroes are popping up more than ever. Between ""Guardians of the Galaxy's"" Gamora, Scarlett Johansson's roles as Black Widow and ""Lucy"" (and soon to come, ""Ghost in the Shell"") and upcoming movies based on ""Wonder Woman"" and ""Captain Marvel,"" it has been a great time to see women have a chance to kick butt and take names. ""Agent Carter"" is a special example, a spinoff of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" following the continuing adventures of Cap's World War II girlfriend after the war was over and she believed him to be dead. Peggy Carter runs up against sexism in her office, where she's relegated to fetching coffee and answering phones, but she goes on her own rogue action-packed missions, uncovering perhaps more than she bargained for. ""She's capable and strong, but what we haven't seen are the emotional and psychological consequences of losing the love of her life, of living in a male-dominated environment, of being a triple spy and making sure that people around her don't know who she really is,"" star Hayley Atwell said. ""That creates feelings of isolation in her."" Atwell commented on where a lot of the strides for women in action roles have come from. ""It feels like we have great roles in Black Widow and Pepper Potts, and Marvel is leading the way for more female characters,"" she said. ""The fans want to see it, and they're exceeding their expectations."" Just like everything with Marvel, it can all be traced back to the comic books. 2014 was a banner year for female characters, with new series for the aforementioned ""Captain Marvel,"" as well as ""She-Hulk,"" ""Ms. Marvel"" and ""Angela: Asgard's Assassin."" Perhaps most significantly, the mighty Thor is now a woman. Not to be outdone, DC Comics (owned by Time Warner, as is CNN) revamped Batgirl and launched a new ""Sensation Comics"" series featuring Wonder Woman, and a ""Harley Quinn"" series. ""This is a ground-up phenomenon,"" explained ""Ms. Marvel"" writer G. Willow Wilson. ""This began with the fans. Part of it is because there's gender parity of who goes to (comic book) conventions. It used to be overwhelmingly male. Now at New York Comic Con for example, it's 50/50 men and women. As you bring in more female readers into the medium, they're going to want to spend their money on stories they think are worth reading."" ""Five or six years ago, we probably had one female-led series on the stands,"" pointed out Marvel editor Sana Amanat, who has made it her mission to make comics for women and other underserved demographics. ""When we came back with 'Captain Marvel' a few years ago, the response was almost cult-like from the reactions we've had from fans. The way we revamped the character resonated with a lot of the audience, especially female readers."" And Marvel is no stranger to pushing past the norm in comics. ""Marvel had 'X-Men's' Storm -- at that time, you would be hard-pressed to find a woman of color in a position of leadership,"" Wilson noted. ""Now there's much more freedom to tell authentic experiences that women readers will recognize."" ""Captain Marvel"" writer Kelly Sue DeConnick writes stories about women she recognizes as well, whether they have superpowers or not. ""Carol (Danvers) is a woman who is very aware of her flaws,"" DeConnick said of the Captain's popularity (the fanbase is called the ""Carol Corps""). ""She's not perfect. She doesn't pretend to be. She's always trying to do a little better. She attracts people who have that same quality. Yes, Carol is short-tempered and can be very self-centered. But there are others who do the same."" Giving female characters flaws in comic books was tough in years past, according to ""Angela"" writer Marguerite Bennett. ""There was an undercurrent of pressure to make (every lead female character) a role model,"" she said. ""So often, you saw female characters written poorly. But if you write a character who always makes the right decision, it becomes very tedious very quickly.  It's great to have a character who can really screw up and make terrible choices."" Amanat has been very sensitive about how women are written in comics. ""The one way you can get women to read comics is to not talk down to them and to see representations of women that are strong and beautiful at the same time without being overly sexualized,"" she said. ""They want to see themselves as sexy and beautiful, but they don't want to be exploited."" And characters such as Agent Carter show how things have changed in portraying heroic women. ""There's nothing inherently masculine about heroism,"" said DeConnick. ""Female heroism has been underplayed because it doesn't serve the default narrative. There's nothing inherently masculine about telling stories with pictures, or wish fulfillment or even power fantasies. I'm a 5-foot woman who's always looked like a child; I can teach any man in any room about power fantasies."" Who better to discuss the importance of heroic female characters than one of the first? Before Wonder Woman (and certainly before Captain Marvel or Agent Carter), there was Batgirl, as portrayed by Yvonne Craig on the ""Batman"" TV series in 1967 and '68. ""Women would see me at conventions and say 'When I was a little girl, I saw that girls could kick butt just as well as guys if they wanted to, and it was that character that made that apparent to me,' "" Craig said. ""Men would say, 'I married my wife because of that character; she showed me women could be so much more than we were conditioned to believe in those days.' "" Nearly 50 years after Craig's Batgirl, we're seeing how female heroes can inspire people in a much bigger way.","""Agent Carter"" is the latest action series or film featuring a woman .

"It's tense in Thailand, where violence has spilled into the streets, people have died or been injured, and the army declared martial law Tuesday. Underscoring the instability, the army's decision to take control of the country came as a surprise to acting Prime Minister Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan, an aide to the leader told CNN. The army ""took this action unilaterally,"" said the aide, who did not wish to be named. The person described the action as ""half a coup d'etat."" Lt. Gen. Nipat Thonglek said the move was not a coup. ""The army aims to maintain peace, order and public safety for all groups and all parties,"" a ticker running on the army's television channel said. ""People are urged not to panic, and can carry on their business as usual,"" he said. The people of Thailand are all too familiar with coups. There have been at least 18 actual and attempted military takeovers since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, through a spokesman, issued a statement about the imposition of martial law, saying that he has consistently called on all sides to work together. He is quoted in the statement as saying peace in Thailand can only come about if the people have respect ""for democratic principles and engagement in democratic processes."" The secretary-general urged all sides to exercise ""utmost restraint, refrain from any violence and fully respect human rights,"" according to the statement. Boiling point . The current turmoil in Thailand has been building for some time. On May 7, Yingluck Shinawatra was removed from government after the Thai Constitutional Court ruled that she was guilty of violating the constitution. The charges against her were brought in a lawsuit that anti-government senators filed. They accused her of abusing her power by unlawfully transferring National Security Council chief Thawil Pliensri from his role in September 2011, alleging the move was intended to benefit her Puea Thai Party and a family member. ""I didn't do anything against the law,"" Yingluck insisted in court. ""I have performed my duty in the administration with the intention of benefiting the country."" Her ascension to power -- in a caretaker role -- came about because of more instability. She dissolved parliament in December, ahead of a general election in February that was disrupted by anti-government protesters. The Constitutional Court subsequently ruled the election invalid. In November, protesters had taken to the streets against the government's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have made it possible for Yingluck's brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, to return to power. The communications tycoon was ousted in a coup in 2006 and has been living in self-imposed exile in Dubai. Much of the tension between protesters in Thailand, who have clashed violently in recent years, centers on Thaksin. There are those who vehemently oppose him and those who want him back in power. Many of Yingluck Shinawatra's opponents say her brother is calling the shots in Thailand through her. READ MORE: Thailand wakes to martial law: What it means . Martial law helping or hurting? It's too soon to tell whether the military's declaration of martial law will ease tensions or heighten them, analysts said. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political science professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, described the situation as ""very volatile."" ""This is a precarious time now for the army,"" he said. ""They have to be evenhanded."" ""If it's seen as favoring one side or the other side, then we could see more violence and turmoil against the military."" Paul Quaglia, director at Bangkok-based risk assessment firm PQA Associates, described the situation as ""martial law lite."" ""Right now, the military has deployed troops around key intersections of the city. Traffic is a real mess here at the moment, but there's no violence,"" he said. ""I think what the military is trying to do with this ... is to convince protesters to go home. They're trying to dial down the tensions here as well as preempt several large rallies and strikes that were scheduled for later this week."" Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher on Thailand in Human Rights Watch's Asia division, said declaring martial law is a serious step away from democracy. ""With the enforcement of martial law, the army is one step closer to taking over power completely from civilian administration,"" he said. ""There is no check and balance; there is no safeguards against rights violations."" Guarding the media . As the sun came up Tuesday, the military was guarding all Thai TV stations, Thai public television announced, showing pictures of soldiers and armored vehicles taking positions outside broadcast facilities in the country's capital. In a statement read on Thai television, the military declared that all of the country's radio and television stations must suspend their normal programs ""when it is needed."" The dramatic announcements come days after the head of the army issued a stern warning after political violence had surged in the country's capital. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok alerted American citizens in the country that martial law had been imposed. It warned them to pay attention to media coverage of Thailand and avoid protests and public gatherings, cautioning that peaceful events could turn violent. Journalists inside the country posted on Twitter that some of their social media accounts were being blocked. Command and control . The military has established a security task force called the Peace Keeping Command Center, which is headed by army Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha and operates from the Thai Army Club in Bangkok. The task force has ordered officials to appear before it. Local and international journalists formed a crowd outside the building waiting for Prayuth to speak. At a news conference, the general said he wanted ""all political parties"" to start a dialogue aimed at ending the political crisis in Thailand, saying the military ""won't allow any bloodshed."" ""We cannot keep having"" conflict, Prayuth said. He apologized for banning some TV broadcasts, justifying the measure for reasons of national security. He would not say when martial law would end but indicated he did not foresee it lasting for three to six months. Going forward . What happens next will depend on how protesters react, Quaglia said. ""The military is taking a step-by-step, gentle approach to see if they can get things to improve,"" he said. ""If not, they'll of course have to ratchet up their actions."" Nipat, the lieutenant general, said the precise restrictions of martial law were being worked out. Members of the government's ""red shirt"" support base, many of whom hail from the country's rural north and northeast, view Yingluck Shinawatra's ouster as a ""judicial coup"" and have been protesting what they consider an unfair bias by many of the country's institutions against their side. Anti-government protesters are seeking a new government -- but not through elections, which members of the opposition Democrat Party has boycotted, arguing the alleged corruption of their political rivals makes widespread reform necessary before any meaningful vote can be held. Increased government efforts to improve security are a positive step, Quaglia said. ""That being said, martial law will not solve the political problems that continue to haunt this country,"" he said. ""The differences are stark, and I don't think the military can step in and by force fix the political issues."" Army declares martial law, government wasn't informed .

"Paris (CNN)A picture of French journalists on the roof of Charlie Hebdo's offices sounded the first alarm. They had taken shelter from three armed men who had just opened fire against their colleagues during the weekly satirical newspaper's editorial committee. Events unfolded very rapidly from then on. French President François Hollande was very quick on the scene, the terrorist nature of the events was confirmed almost immediately and so was the shocking number of casualties: 12 dead and 11 injured, some critically. The operation appeared to have been prepared in a military style with weapons of war. What can cartoonists with their pen and paper do against killers with automatic weapons? The news spread fast, sending tremors through France. Then the dead were given names, this is probably when the news really sank in. The cartoonists with the noms de plume Charb, Cabu, Wolinski and Tignous, known to millions in France, had been assassinated, at point blank range. Cabu and Wolinski, in particular, both in their late 70s, have accompanied generations of French people and made them laugh every week, in many different publications, on radio and on television, for over 50 years. I heard people unable to finish their sentences, forced to hang up the phone on learning the news -- too moved to speak. I saw shoppers stopping in their tracks, sinking lost onto benches, others in tears when learning the news from a friend's call. As U.S. Secretary John Kerry later commented, both in French and English, from Washington: France gave democracy to the world and knows better than most the price of Liberty. The French have been shockingly reminded that Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité -- values they fought hard to see every day on the frontispiece of their schools and public buildings -- are threatened by terrorists. While their identities have not yet been confirmed, France, with the largest Muslim community in the Western world (around 6 million out of a population of 66 million) has always been a prime target for Islamist extremists. In 1995, Paris reeled from a wave of terrorist attacks by the Algerian GIA, which killed a total of 12 people. In 1986, the Hezbollah had carried another deadly attack, bombing the grand magasin Tati, and killing 8 passers-by. French secret services were notoriously good at preventing such plots and President Hollande today revealed that many planned attacks had been very recently foiled. There will be a lot of soul searching in the next weeks and months within the French and President Hollande is facing difficult questions and an enormous task. With the far right of Marine Le Pen blowing the flames of national divisions and blaming immigration for France's many social and economic problems, and the left trying very hard not to stigmatize its Muslim citizens, there is little space left for a robust and calm public debate. The news that the French writer Michel Houellebecq, is now under police protection, as a result of today's attack on Charlie Hebdo, means that the French Interior ministry takes no chances with terrorism, but it also shows the depth of the malaise at the heart of French society. Houellebecq's latest novel takes place in 2022 during the presidential elections. After a second round between the far right and a French Islamist, the Islamists are rise to victory with the help of the liberal left -- and France is refounded as an Islamic State. Today, a French imam called the dead journalists and cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo ""martyrs of freedom."" But France may have also discovered the price of its complacency and learned that such Fraternité should never be taken for granted.

"(CNN)The man who stars as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in ""Selma"" seems as divinely appointed to the role as the leader he portrays was to the civil rights movement. David Oyelowo said it was seven years ago when he read the script for the film about the marches in the Alabama city and the fight to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He so felt God telling him the role of King was meant for him that he wrote the date down to remember it. But it was a long road for the British actor who was faced with everything from being little known beyond small parts in films like ""The Last King of Scotland"" to those connected to the film having a different vision for who should star. Yet Oyelowo never lost faith. He told CNN that he took  the challenge of playing one of history's giants very seriously. ""Doubt ... never really beset me,"" he said. ""What did hit me were moments of feeling the weight ... and the responsibility to get it right."" How do you pronounce 'Oyelowo'? Brad Pitt offers a singalong guide . The film focuses on three months in Selma, Alabama, in 1965 when nonviolent protesters held civil rights marches including ""Bloody Sunday,"" when law enforcement clashed with demonstrators using billy clubs and tear gas on Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge. Some lost their lives in the midst of the tension over the protests and Oyelowo said that in studying King he learned a great deal about how conflicted the leader felt during that time. ""The thing that really struck me was the weight and the guilt he felt about the people who were killed,"" the actor said. Time magazine has called ""Selma"" ""the film of the year"" and noted that ""This solid, expertly managed drama, with its stark images of good men standing up to entrenched government evil, has earned critical hosannahs and could be the breakout favorite among year-end contenders for the Academy Award."" Oyelowo's performance has been hailed for embracing both King the legend and the man. ""Oyelowo is superb in the central role of King, capturing his famous cadences without ever descending into mimicry,"" Christopher Orr wriote for The Atlantic. ""This is a life-sized portrait of a larger-than-life figure, and never more so than in the scenes between King and his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo), their marriage strained not only by the ever-present threat of violence but also by his own serial infidelities, which the movie handles with tact but does not shy away from."" The star is not the only one who sees a greater hand in the project. Oprah Winfrey served as one of the producers on the film and has a small role. She told Variety she believes it's not accidental that the film, which will open nationwide on January 9, is being released at a time when the nation is once again focused on race in the wake of the controversial deaths of black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City. ""Divine timing is what it is,"" said Winfrey, who also co-starred with Oyelowo in ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" and has become his mentor. Oscar buzz is ever present for the movie in every category from best picture to best director for Ava DuVernay, who could become the first African-American woman nominated in the category. In addition to Winfrey, Brad Pitt also played a producing role, and the film festival circuit seems to have fallen in love with the movie. Filming, which happened in Alabama and Atlanta, was intense, Oyelowo said, especially filming King's speech at the state capital in Montgomery. (The speeches in the film are approximations, because the King family reportedly blocked using the actual speeches.) Oyelowo said he had an eerie feeling in the days leading up to it. ""I felt this bizarre feeling of death around me,"" he said. ""He had consistently been told not to make that speech as there was a real fear of possible assassination. At the end of the day I felt almost surprised that I would be alive. I know that sounds strange, but I feel like I had so deeply entrenched myself that I could feel some of the fears he must have felt."" Oyelowo prepped meticulously for the role: shaving his hairline back, gaining weight, losing his British accent, reading and studying film of  King. He's humble about a possible best actor Oscar nod (he's already been nominated for several other awards, including a Golden Globe and a Critics Choice Award), but said he is beyond satisfied with his performance. ""I know I gave it everything I possibly could,"" he said. ""I am my own worst critic and the point beyond which I am happy to leave it alone is knowing there wasn't one single thing I could do differently.""","The British actor is winning raves for his performance .
He has a spiritual connection to the role .

"(CNN)Yesterday, members of the 114th Congress took the oath of office and ushered in a new Republican majority. It's a fresh beginning for our country, and I'm optimistic. A lot can be achieved if President Obama and his party work with us to advance common-sense jobs ideas for the middle class. In the Senate, we welcome many new senators determined to achieve serious results. These men and women share my party's resolve to end Washington's dysfunction and get things done for the middle class again. The truth is, the American people no longer trust Washington to do the right thing. For many, it's never seemed harder just to get by. Many faced the reality of losing their health plan after being told they could keep it. Many continue to struggle with rising medical costs that the president and his allies in Congress repeatedly told us would fall. Confidence in the American Dream wanes at home, while the world seems filled with chaos overseas. Americans are rightly concerned. And yet, for years Washington has seemed uninterested or incapable of addressing their concerns; for years, Washington seemed to be working for itself instead of for them. That changes today. Because the message voters sent in November was clear. They want the administration to change course and move to the middle, and they want dysfunction in the Senate to come to an end. The American people didn't ask for a government that tries to do everything and they didn't ask for a government that aims to do nothing. They want a government that works again. They want us to focus on more jobs, more opportunity, and more flexibility for a middle class that feels squeezed. Jobs ideas with strong bipartisan support -- like simplifying our broken tax system, opening more markets to American-made products, and approving bipartisan infrastructure projects like the Keystone Pipeline -- provide a strong foundation for success. We plan to work to send that kind of common-sense legislation to the president for his signature. But to ensure the best outcome, two things will be needed. First, we need a Congress that functions again. Having an effective Congress will help us move beyond an age of government by crisis. But it's going to take significant changes to the way the Senate's been operating. The era we've just been through -- with bipartisan jobs bills sent over from the House routinely killed, and senators' serious jobs ideas regularly silenced — has to change. Second, both parties need to make divided government work. This is where President Obama really comes in. His recent actions, including threatening to veto a bipartisan jobs project like the Keystone XL pipeline within minutes of the new Congress being sworn in, have been anything but productive. The President himself has noted that the American people are counting on him to work with the Congress they elected to get things accomplished. Now it's time to show he meant it I hope he will. As we've seen in the past, divided government isn't a reason to do nothing; it's often been a spur to achieve big things. Reagan worked with Democratic leaders to pass bold reforms to taxes and Social Security. A Republican Congress worked with Clinton to pass groundbreaking welfare reform. And if President Obama is interested in historic achievement, this can be his time, too. But bipartisan progress can only be achieved if President Obama is interested in it. He's the only one who can bring his party on board or sign what Congress passes. It won't be easy for him. The president's supporters are pressing for militancy, not compromise. But they need to understand that democracy isn't about what you can get away with, it's about what you can achieve together. Whatever the president decides, this Congress is going to function again. It's going to legislate again for the people we were sent here to serve. Some of the things we pass may seem significant; some may seem more modest. That's okay. And while we're always going to be looking for areas where we can agree, it's also okay if the president doesn't love every bill Congress passes. Few presidents do. The point is, our job is not to protect the President from good ideas. Our job is to get the Senate back to work. Our job is to focus on serious ideas designed to boost the middle class and help restore our nation's promise for future generations. And that's just what we plan to do.","Mitch McConnell: Americans expect Washington to work for them .

"(CNN) -- Washington isn't listening. The disconnect between the American people and the agenda being advanced in Washington is growing by the day. When Americans have spoken up, their voices have fallen on deaf ears. Political expedience and partisan allegiances have repeatedly trumped the priorities of the American people. Americans wanted jobs, but instead Washington passed a ""stimulus"" that has failed to keep unemployment below 8 percent as promised -- while producing countless instances of government waste. Americans wanted lower health care costs, but instead Washington passed a health care law that will actually increase costs and hurt our economy. Americans want common-sense fiscal discipline, but Washington continues to spend money we don't have and pile debt on future generations. The current approach in Washington is failing the American people, who deserve a Congress and a government that puts their priorities and everyday concerns first. It's not enough, however, for Republicans to simply state our principled opposition to the current agenda. We must also offer the American people a clear set of solutions they can expect us to fight for, a project that House Republican Leader John Boehner has tasked me to lead. Shortly after beginning this important work, we realized that distrust in government runs too deep to simply hand down a policy plan from Washington. More than just new policy, we also need to change the way Washington sets its policy. That notion is the driving force behind America Speaking Out, an unprecedented initiative designed to engage the public in a discussion of your priorities for America. Read more about the GOP's plan . Beginning next week, House Republicans will be setting out across the country to hold America Speaking Out town halls, where we will seek your input on creating a new policy agenda. At the same time, we will be using all the technological tools available to us, such as phone apps and telephone town halls, to listen to the priorities of the American people. This effort includes a new interactive website -- AmericaSpeakingOut.com -- that will allow anyone, regardless of party, to submit what he or she believes should be a part of this new plan. We have developed this site to be the home for an online conversation between members of Congress and those they are elected to represent. These ideas and exchanges will serve as the building blocks for the governing agenda we will present to the American people later this year. Of course, this will be a Republican agenda, so this project is designed to take core common-sense, conservative principles -- whether it's building a smaller, more accountable government, economic freedom and lower taxes, or providing for a strong national defense -- and discuss how they can be applied to America's priorities. Rather than a listening tour, we are seeking a robust debate about the challenges we face and the solutions that should be pursued. Leadership is about laying out clear solutions to the challenges we face, just as we have offered positive alternatives to Democratic policies with which we disagree. But leadership today also requires a humility that appreciates that Americans are really in charge of Congress. America Speaking Out recognizes that the wisdom and will of the American people are the only things strong enough to change the course our nation is on. Building a new agenda for our nation starts today, and we hope all Americans will join us in the process. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin McCarthy.","Rep.

"A previously secret document found at Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan sets out a detailed al Qaeda strategy for attacking targets in Europe and the United States. The document -- a letter written to bin Laden in March 2010 by a senior operational figure in the terror group -- reveals that tunnels, bridges, dams, undersea pipelines and internet cables were among the targets. It was written by Younis al-Mauretani, a senior al Qaeda planner thought to have been behind an ambitious plan to hit ""soft"" targets in Europe in the fall of 2010. The U.S. Department of Justice passed the letter to German prosecutors last year for use in an ongoing trial in Dusseldorf because it possibly refers to one of the defendants, according to the German newspaper Die Zeit, which first broke the story. CNN has obtained details of the document from sources briefed on its contents. The 17-page letter is in Arabic. Al-Mauretani proposed that al Qaeda recruits take jobs with companies transporting gasoline and and other sensitive companies in the West,  and await the right moment to strike. He said targets should include tunnels, airports and even ""Love Parades"" -- gay and lesbian events held every summer in Germany. He said recruits should infiltrate university courses in the West in key subjects useful to the group including physics and chemistry, so that they could later be re-activated and help the group, according to Die Zeit. He also suggested attaching mines to undersea pipelines using mini-submarines -- and appears to have researched ways to circumvent safety valves on such pipelines. Al Mauretani also proposed that al Qaeda attack financial centers and think-tanks -- specifically mentioning the RAND Corporation, whose headquarters are in California. Asked if it was aware of the threat, a spokesman for RAND told CNN that ""as a matter of policy, the RAND Corporation does not comment on specific security issues or potential threats."" Yassin Musharbash, an investigative reporter with Die Zeit in Berlin, says the document seems ""to support information gleaned from other terror trials that Al Qaeda in 2010 was trying to plan a comprehensive plot against the West,"" and al-Mauretani appears to have been bent on  ""hitting Europe and the U.S. by targeting critical infrastructure and economic targets."" Some of al-Mauretani's ideas may seem far-fetched, but they underline al Qaeda's continuing fascination with bringing down airliners. He proposed that men recruited into the Yemeni al Qaeda affiliate AQAP become pilots with airlines, and then drug their co-pilots before flying the plane into a target. One target he identified was the massive petrochemical facility at Abqaiq in Saudi Arabia. Al Mauretani suggested that Osama bin Laden signal the go-ahead for attacks in Europe with a public message that al Qaeda's patience with Europe had run out. And he had a clear sense of how to finance attacks, saying that al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)  had ""millions"" and its leaders trusted him, according to Die Zeit. Mauretani himself was originally from Mauritania in north-west Africa. Sources briefed on the contents of the letter told CNN that al-Mauretani wrote that al Qaeda Central in Pakistan could only cover the starting costs of the operation against Europe and additional costs would have to be covered by AQIM and others. Analysts tell CNN al-Mauretani's call for  the various nodes of al Qaeda  to work together was emblemmatic of a shift within the terrorist network towards greater coordination and pooling of resources. Phone call links Benghazi attack to al Qaeda commander . Al-Mauretani added that AQIM had a ""great deal of trust"" in him, according to the sources. According to analysts the North African operative paved the way for direct cooperation between AQIM and al Qaeda's senior leadership in the late 2000s after he travelled to Pakistan. In late 2011 Moktar Belmoktar, then a senior figure in AQIM, told a Mauritanian journalist that al-Mauretani was the ""first direct contact between us and our brothers in Al-Qaeda."" Bin Laden appears to have liked the ideas in al-Mauretani's letter, and assigned them high priority. Other documents found at his Pakistani compound in Abbottabad suggest he forwarded it to at least one other senior figure in al Qaeda. In around June 2010, bin Laden wrote to senior Libyan operative Atiyah abd al Rahman, then al Qaeda's head of operations in Waziristan, instructing him to tell the leaders of the al Qaeda affiliates AQIM in North Africa and AQAP in Yemen to ""put forward their best in cooperating"" with al-Mauretani ""in whatever he asks of them."" ""Hint to the brothers in the Islamic Maghreb that they provide him with the financial support that he might need in the next six months, to the tune of approximately 200,000 euros,"" bin Laden wrote. CNN has learned the document was sent to German prosecutors by the Justice Department after they had asked for any information the United States might have about three men from the Dusseldorf area charged with planning an attack in Germany on behalf of al Qaeda in April 2011. CNN asked the Justice Department about the document but has so far received no comment. According to Die Zeit, the reason the letter was relayed to the Germans was because al-Mauretani mentions a Moroccan in the document with exactly the same date of birth as Abdeladim el-K, who prosecutors claim was the ringleader of the alleged Dusseldorf cell and trained with al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2010. Sources briefed on the contents of the document told CNN that al-Mauretani appears to suggest the Moroccan should travel to join up with militants in Somalia if his mission failed. Sources say three FBI officials will testify at the trial in Dusseldorf Wednesday on the authenticity of the document. Defense lawyers say they have ""fundamental doubts"" about  the document. As for al-Mauretani, he is unlikely to have any role in bringing his terror plans to fruition. He was picked up by Pakistani police in Quetta in August 2011 and remains in detention. Pakistani authorities appear to have uncovered some of his terror plans. In announcing his arrest a month later, they stated:  al-Mauretani ""was tasked personally by Osama bin Laden to focus on hitting  targets of economical importance in United States of America, Europe and  Australia, including gas pipelines, power generating dams and oil tankers."" Several of al-Mauretani's western recruits -- trained in the tribal territories of Pakistan -- have been arrested on their return home. American al Qaeda recruit Bryant Neal Vinas testified at his trial that that he had drawn a map for al-Mauretani in mid-2008, showing Long Island Railroad lines. Al-Mauretani had decided the best scheme would be to launch a suicide bombing on a train as it entered a tunnel. And he told Vinas that preferably a white operative with Western travel documents would be tasked to carry out the attack. In 2010, al-Mauretani was seen as the mastermind of planned attacks in Europe.  Fears that such attacks would materialize led the U.S. State Department to issue a travel alert in October 2010. Sources briefed on the letter told CNN that al-Mauretani requested bin Laden issue a statement saying al Qaeda's patience with Europe had run out following the al Qaeda leader's previous offering of a conditional truce, and that his statement needed to be choreographed with an attack shortly afterwards. ""We ask you undertake certain steps in order to threaten Europe before the attacks happen. And these steps should be in synch with the preparations of those attacks. Inform Europe that patience has come to an end, as has our hope that they end their campaign against us. Also [make clear] that they have not understood our message thus far. One or two weeks after that we will strike ... and then we will threaten them again. After we hit Europe we will hit America, so we isolate the Americans,""  the sources said al-Mauretani wrote in the letter. Die Zeit's Musharbash says al-Mauretani's blueprint ""has very likely little operational value now. But certain ideas may have trickled down and may still be alive elsewhere in the network.""

"(CNN)Enjoy it while you can, but remember it won't last forever. That was President Barack Obama's message to American consumers on Tuesday as he discussed near six year-low gas prices in an interview with The Detroit News ahead of a visit to Michigan on Wednesday to tout the recovery of the auto industry and the growth of American manufacturing. ""I would strongly advise American consumers to continue to think about how you save money at the pump because it is good for the environment, it's good for family pocketbooks and if you go back to old habits and suddenly gas is back at $3.50, you are going to not be real happy,"" Obama said. The nationwide average is sitting just below $2.20 a gallon and many gas stations around the country are advertising gas prices below $2 a gallon. But instead of returning to ""old habits,"" Obama advised Americans to save their money, ""or better yet"" use the savings to buy a new car, for example. He said Americans should ""not believe that"" gas prices won't rise again, explaining that demand for oil in booming countries like China and India will continue to rise, kicking costs back up. Oil prices have dropped more than 50% in recent months, falling below $50 a barrel for the first time since 2009 on Monday. Many members of Congress are counting on gas prices to remain low, however, as they hope to use the low prices as an opportunity to increase the gas tax for the first time in more than two decades. As he touts the results of his bailout of the auto industry on Wednesday, Obama will also promote fuel efficiency at the Ford plant he is set to visit, which produces alternative fuel vehicles and small cars, The News reported. Obama gave the newspaper a preview of his speech Wednesday, in which he is expected to tout the resurgence of the auto industry and the boom of American manufacturing -- two key points of his plan for economic recovery, and elements he hopes will become a part of his legacy as president. ""The auto industry has led a resurgence of manufacturing in America,"" Obama said. ""The quality of the cars has gotten so much better that we are competitive â€” not just in SUVs â€” but up and down the line. The branding of American cars is back to where it should be.

"(CNN)Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker will launch a new political organization in the coming weeks and has tapped a national political strategist to serve as his campaign manager should he decide to run for president, multiple GOP sources told CNN. Walker, who was sworn in to a second term in Madison this week, quietly brought on Rick Wiley, a former Republican National Committee political director and veteran of multiple presidential campaigns, about a month ago to build a political operation in advance of the 2016 race, the sources said. Walker's moves are the latest in a swirl of recent activity from big-name Republicans eyeing a  White House bid. Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum have all maneuvered quickly since the New Year to hire staff, court donors and remove potential obstacles to running. Wiley, who declined to comment on the job, has been aggressively reaching out to potential staffers in recent weeks. And Walker himself will attend the RNC's winter meeting in San Diego next week to meet with committee members, including delegations from the early primary and caucus states that kick off the presidential nominating process. One source close to Walker told CNN that the governor has no timeline for announcing a presidential bid but will be forming ""some kind of entity in the coming weeks to lend itself as a vehicle"" -- likely a leadership PAC -- before moving forward with a full-blown campaign. Walker and his aides have said that he will not announce his intentions until after the Wisconsin legislative session concludes this year. A native midwesterner who once worked for the Wisconsin Republican Party, Wiley advised several gubernatorial campaigns, including Walker's, during the 2014 election cycle. He was RNC political director in 2012 and previously worked on the presidential campaigns of Rudy Giuliani in 2008 and George W. Bush's re-election in 2004. Wiley had also been mentioned a possible campaign manager for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Wiley works at the same consulting firm, Mercury LLC, as a Christie's chief political guru Michael DuHaime. ""The governor is definitely committed to putting a great team around him,"" the source close to the Walker said. Walker has demonstrated his political toughness with three statewide victories in four years â€” his 2010 election, a 2012 recall attempt after a bruising fight with Democrats and organized labor, and his 2014 re-election â€” and has a tightly-knit crew of aides and loyalists in Wisconsin. But some conservatives writers and even members of his own team have said the governor needs to bring on more advisers with national experience if he hopes to win the GOP nomination in 2016.","Wisconsin Gov.

"(CNN) -- African ministers and health experts are meeting in Ghana with one thing on their minds: how to stop the biggest ever outbreak of the Ebola virus from extending its deadly reach still further. The World Health Organization has warned that ""drastic action"" is needed to halt the killer in its tracks. It reports there have been 759 cases, including 467 deaths, in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia as of June 30. The outbreak began in March. This makes it the ""largest in terms of the number of cases and deaths as well as geographical spread,"" said WHO. Not only is it uncontained, but this strain of the Ebola virus can kill up to 90% of those infected. READ MORE: What you need to know about Ebola . The scientist who first discovered the Ebola virus in the 1970s, Dr. Peter Piot, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the situation is ""unprecedented."" ""One, [this is] the first time in West Africa that we have such an outbreak,"" he said. ""Secondly, it is the first time that three countries are involved. And thirdly it's the first time that we have outbreaks in capitals, in capital cities."" The looming threat has brought together the health ministers of 11 African nations -- the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Uganda -- as well as health experts, Ebola survivors, and WHO representatives. Also present at the two-day summit in Accra, Ghana, are the representatives of airlines and mining companies, as well as donor nations helping to fund efforts to combat the virus. New cases of the virus continue to be reported. Between June 25 and 30, 22 new cases of the virus were reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, WHO said. Of those, 14 died. Exposure to body fluids . Ebola is a violent killer. The symptoms, at first, mimic the flu: headache, fever, fatigue. What comes next sounds like something out of a horror movie: significant diarrhea and vomiting, while the virus shuts off the blood's ability to clot. As a result, patients often suffer internal and external hemorrhaging. Many die in an average of 10 days. People are traveling without realizing they're carrying the deadly virus. It can take between two and 21 days after exposure for someone to feel sick. The good news is that Ebola isn't as easily spread as one may think. A patient isn't contagious -- meaning they can't spread the virus to other people -- until they are already showing symptoms. Then, the disease is transmitted by direct contact with the blood and body fluids of infected animals or people, according to WHO. In April, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta traveled to Conakry, Guinea, to report on what was being done to treat patients and contain the outbreak. ""It took only moments to feel the impact of what was happening here,"" Gupta wrote after landing in Conakry. ""There is a lot we know about Ebola, and it scares us almost as much as what we don't know."" Fighting an epidemic . Doctors Without Borders, also known as MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res, has been working to fight the epidemic since March. But it warned in a news release last week that a ""massive deployment of resources"" is needed by West African nations and other organizations, saying it has reached the limit of what its teams can do. Ebola outbreaks usually are confined to remote areas, making the disease easier to contain. But this outbreak is different; patients have been identified in 60 locations in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. ""The epidemic is out of control,"" says Dr. Bart Janssens, MSF director of operations. ""With the appearance of new sites in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, there is a real risk of it spreading to other areas."" Officials believe the wide footprint of this outbreak is partly because of the proximity between the jungle where the virus was first identified and cities such as Conakry. The capital of Guinea has a population of 2 million and an international airport. Complicating matters, the countries hit hardest by the epidemic have major medical infrastructure challenges. There is also a real sense of mistrust toward health workers from communities. In Sierra Leone and Guinea, WHO has said that community members have thrown stones at health care workers trying to investigate the outbreak. MSF has treated 470 people, it said last week, of which 215 were confirmed cases. However, it is now ""having difficulty responding to the large number of new cases and locations,"" it said. While public anxiety is high, the statement said, governments and civil society groups are doing too little to acknowledge the scale of the epidemic or educate people about how to stop the spread of the disease. Another organization helping victims is Samaritan's Purse, an international Christian aid group. It has doctors in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, and near the border with Guinea. Virus 'should be easy to stop' There is no cure for Ebola, but in theory the disease should be easy to fight, Piot told CNN. ""You need really close contact to become infected. So just being on the bus with someone with Ebola, that's not a problem."" Simple hygienic measures like washing with soap and water, not re-using syringes, and avoiding contact with infected corpses are sufficient to stop spread of the disease, Piot said. ""This is an epidemic of dysfunctional health systems,"" he added. ""Fear of the virus, and the lack of trust in government, in the health system, is as bad as the actual virus.""

"(CNN)The videos taken by citizens of Paris during Wednesday's attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo indicate significant training on the part of terrorists. Here are some things any military professional would observe: . • The uniform: All the attackers are uniform in appearance. All have vests capable of holding multiple magazines of ammunition for their weapons, and perhaps grenades.  Additionally, they are all wearing what appear to be heavy coats. That could indicate either body armor or possibly suicide vests underneath to be detonated if captured.  Some experts are suggesting ""they came to kill, not to die,"" but those of us with experience in these kinds of encounters might suggest they came to kill until they are trapped -- then they will willingly die if they can kill more by detonating a suicide vest as a last resort. • Use of weapons: The terrorists were wielding AK-47s, according to police spokesman Xavier Castaing, but at least one of them also appeared to have a military 3-point sling attached to the weapon (the white strap going over the shoulder).  These slings are used in close-in attacks.  The driver does not appear to have this strap, which allows for freedom in the car. The attackers appear to be good marksmen, as evidenced by the tight shot of a group of bullets that riddled the windshield of a French police car, shown in several photographs at the scene. Additionally, the attackers have their weapons on semi-automatic (single shot) versus full automatic. Many terrorists use what U.S. soldiers derisively call the ""pray and spray"" method.  That is, they point their weapons on full automatic, scream a religious slogan and let loose with a stream of bullets -- most of which don't hit the targets.  These terrorists appear well-trained, with aimed fire, single shots and controlled targeting. • Fire and maneuver: These terrorists appear to have been trained in movement techniques: They use cover (parked automobiles, or an open car door) and aim fire while their terrorist ""buddy"" maneuvers to a new firing location.  At that point, the moving terrorist aims and fires, while the previously covering terrorist moves to join him. • Reconnaissance: The attack occurred at noon in busy Paris, yet there was no traffic on the side streets where the citizens' filming took place. Additionally, initial reports indicate that an editors' meeting was occurring at that time, with all the subjects in one room. That indicates there was intelligence, route planning and then individual requirements for the members of the terrorist team. • Speed: They moved fast, knew where they are going, did their job, and then they were gone. Again, that's indicative of rehearsals but also single-mindedness of mission. • Selection of target: This was a follow-on attack. The offices of Charlie Hebdo had been previously firebombed, but that attack was not successful. Much like the initial World Trade Center bombing in 1993 that was followed by the 2001 attack, these terrorists were again going after the same target. Usually, terrorists film their attacks for future information operations and social media use.  They may have had terrorist videographers in specific locations for that purpose during this attack as well. Those videos may appear in the future, but until then French citizens posting YouTube videos contribute to the terrorists' information campaign. In the next few hours and days, other countries of Europe -- especially Germany and Italy -- will be interested in sharing information from this attack, as they face similar threats from Muslim extremists. France, the European Union and Interpol will share information, and given the ability of the terrorists to move freely through Europe, this passing of information will be critical. The passport-free Schengen Area allows for movement through 26 countries in Europe on the motorways and autobahns, so while initially this is an attack on France, these terrorists are a threat to all of Europe.","Videos show speed, preparation by terrorists in Paris attack, Mark Hertling says .

"(CNN)The Baltimore Police Department is warning law enforcement agencies along the East Coast to take extra precautions in protecting their officers after a man carrying a .22 caliber handgun walked into one of the city's police stations Tuesday morning on orders from the street gang Black Guerilla Family. Jason Armstrong, 29, told officers the gang ordered him into the station to test the security there, police said. Officers smelled marijuana on him and noticed him acting strangely, so they approached him, Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts said. The Black Guerilla Family is a gang with ties to violence and drug trafficking in the Baltimore area, police said. Officers searched Armstrong and found the handgun, with a round loaded in the chamber. The man also had cocaine and marijuana, Batts said. ""We are really lucky, for a person walking into a police station fully armed and loaded with guns on him, that it did not end up in a terrible situation,"" said Batts. Police charged Armstrong with various weapons and narcotics violations. ""An organized gang in the city of Baltimore sent an armed suspect into our building to see our security, to test our security. That is alarming to us,"" Batts said. ""In light of other incidents that have occurred in other cities, it has raised our level of concern."" Batts said he is calling a meeting with federal agencies including the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Drug Enforcement Administration and has already sent an alert to other law enforcement agencies. ""We're not going to cower, we're not going to back down, we're not going to shy away from tough situations,"" he said.  ""We are going to be a Constitutional police department while we keep this city safe and continue to patrol the streets of the City of Baltimore."" Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriquez said, ""This person did not go in there on his own free will. This person had very little option, according to his statement, which lends credibility to what a dire situation this was."" FBI spokesperson Minique Crump said the bureau is in communication with Baltimore police, but at this point it is a local matter being handled by Baltimore. Crump said the case is not related to a joint FBI-DHS bulletin sent in October warning law enforcement agencies across the country about potential attacks against police officers. The bulletin was sent after intelligence officials picked up chatter from ISIS members urging attacks against government officials, including law enforcement and military personnel.

"(CNN)A member of the grand jury that declined to bring charges in the August 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown is suing the St. Louis County prosecutor to be allowed to speak on the case, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri said Monday. The unnamed juror ""would like to talk about the experience of serving on a grand jury, the evidence presented and the investigation in a way that could contribute to the public dialogue concerning race relations,"" but is barred from doing so by state law that requires secrecy about grand jury deliberations, the ACLU said in a statement. The grand jury decided in November that it would not indict Officer Darren Wilson in the August 9, 2014, shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teen whose death sparked nationwide calls for police reform. Wilson told investigators Brown charged him and he feared for his life, but Brown's family and supporters accused the officer of needlessly killing the 18-year-old. Protests and riots followed the grand jury's decision. The juror, referred to by the ACLU as ""Grand Juror Doe"" is suing Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch because he would be responsible for bringing charges against the grand juror for speaking out, the ACLU said. The organization said it would be wrong for the state to impose a ""lifetime gag order"" on the grand juror. ""The Supreme Court has said that grand jury secrecy must be weighed against the juror's First Amendment rights on a case-by-case basis. The rules of secrecy must yield because this is a highly unusual circumstance,"" ACLU legal director Tony Rothert said.","The unnamed grand juror wants to talk in ""a way that could contribute to the public dialogue concerning race relations,"" ACLU says .

"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama strongly condemned what he called a ""cowardly, evil"" terror attack in Paris on Wednesday that claimed 12 lives and praised France for standing ""shoulder to shoulder"" in the fight against terrorism. Obama said Wednesday that he had ""reached out"" to French President Francois Hollande and pledged to offer ""every bit of assistance"" to help France, a country he praised as ""America's oldest ally."" Three gunmen burst into the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo's headquarters on Wednesday morning and also fired at police officers in the streets outside while shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" -- God is Great in Arabic. ""They have been with us at every moment when we've -- from 9/11 on -- in dealing with the sort of terrorist organizations around the world that threaten us,"" Obama said. ""For us to see the kind of cowardly, evil attacks that took place today, reinforces once again why it's so important for us to stand in solidarity with them just as they stand in solidarity with us."" Sitting in the Oval Office alongside Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, Obama also stressed that the U.S. would work to ensure the safety of Americans living around the world because ""these kinds of attacks can happen anywhere in the world,"" he said. Obama focused also focused on the target of the attack, emphasizing that the assailants were striking at the ""universal belief in freedom of expression."" ""The fact that this was an attack on journalists, an attack on our free press also underscores the degree to which these terrorists fear freedom -- of speech and freedom of the press,"" Obama said. Speaking to CNN's Wolf Blitzer Wednesday night,Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said he was ""confident that these...killers will be brought to justice."" He declined, however, to confirm comments from House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul that the U.S. government was aware of the names of the three attackers, or reports that they may have been apprehended, stating only that ""events are unfolding rapidly."" But he did indicate the U.S. is doing ""a number of things to support the French government in this manhunt and this investigation,"" and suggested under typical protocol, the U.S. Would use all its available national security resources to try to track down the origin and motivation of the attackers. Johnson said while ""this was very definitely a very sophisticated, precise and lethal operation,"" it was still unclear what motivated the attackers. ""We don't know yet exactly what motivated these people, whether they received direct orders from a terrorist org or whether they were inspired by something they saw and read,"" he said. Secretary of State John Kerry earlier in the day addressed the French people directly -- in both English and French -- expressing American solidarity in the face of the attacks. ""We stand with you in solidarity and in commitment both to the cause of confronting extremism and in the cause which the extremists fear so much and which has always united our two countries: freedom,"" Kerry said in a press conference. ""No country knows better than France, that freedom has a price because France gave birth to democracy itself."" Kerry made similar remarks in French, proclaiming that terrorists who claim the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo is dead, are wrong. ""Le pouvoir de la libertÃ© d'expression vainquera dans la lutte contre l'obscurantisme,"" he said, meaning ""The power of freedom of expression will be victorious in the fight against darkness."" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest also pointed to France as a ""stalwart ally"" in the fight against ISIS. France is a member of the U.S.-led coalition that has carried out attacks against ISIS, and Earnest said that the U.S. is ""keenly aware"" of the ""risk associated with that."" He added that U.S. is still ""trying to determine what happened,"" but did point out that the U.S. and its allies are aware of the threat that foreign fighters joining ISIS in the Middle East could pose if they  return to their home countries and carry out attacks using ""that training, use that equipment."" Earnest added that top national security officials have been in touch with their counterparts in France and that the U.S. will provide resources to investigate the attack. ""We are confident that the people of France are not going to be cowed by this threat,"" Earnest said. Earnest also highlighted the need for ""leaders in the Muslim community"" to stand up and proclaim the peaceful nature of their religion. National Security officials monitoring, investigating . The Department of Homeland Security is ""closely monitoring"" the situation in Paris, a senior official from the department said in a statement. ""DHS will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people,"" the official said. ""We also encourage the public that ""If You See Something, Say Something"" and to report any suspicious activity in their communities to the appropriate law enforcement authorities."" Johnson, speaking earlier in the day, would not say whether he is considering raising the terror threat level in the U.S., but highlighted the increasingly complex terror threat the world faces -- with more terror groups, but also ""lone wolf"" actors. ""[These are] actors who may lurk within our society, that could strike with little notice, commit an act of violence because they have been inspired by things they have seen on the internet, social media, in literature, without accepting a direct order...from a terrorist organization,"" Johnson said. He added that investigators are still trying to determine the exact ""nature"" of the attack. The U.S. Embassy in Paris said on Twitter it has ""no plans to close or limit access"" to the embassy or other diplomatic facilities in France. The embassy also changed its Twitter profile picture to the ""Je suis Charlie"" (I am Charlie) image circulating in France in the wake of the attack. U.S. national security and intelligence agencies are rushing to see if they ""missed any signs"" or warnings of a terrorist attack against France, a senior U.S. official told CNN. For now, officials have found ""nothing that matches."" The official said the U.S. does not believe the attack suggests further attacks against Americans the U.S. ""Our major concern is to quickly identify the individuals involved,"" in the attack the official said. U.S. officials also pointed out that the attackers were wearing masks, contradicting reports that ISIS leadership told adherents to show their faces when carrying out attacks. A U.S. official told CNN that French authorities are rapidly trying to find the alleged gunmen. ""If they can't find these guys right away, then they will quickly be sharing any profile information or details with us,"" the official said. White House questioned Charlie Hebdo in 2012 . The attack Wednesday was not the first time the satirical publication Charlie Hebdo apparently drew the ire of Islamists. Its headquarters were firebombed in 2011 the day after it published a satirical cartoon of the Prophet Muhammed. And when the magazine published more satirical cartoons mocking the Prophet in 2012, the White House questioned the magazine's ""judgment"" in September 2012. ""Obviously, we have questions about the judgment of publishing something like this. We know that these images will be deeply offensive to many and have the potential to be inflammatory,"" then-White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. ""But we've spoken repeatedly about the importance of upholding the freedom of expression that is enshrined in our Constitution."" Carney went on to say that the White House didn't question the magazine's right to publish the cartoons, but just ""the judgment behind the decision to publish it."" ""Now it has to be said, and I'll say it again, that no matter how offensive something like this is, it is not in any way justification for violence,"" Carney said at the same briefing. Paris attack quickly becomes Washington funding fight . Lawmakers react . Members of Congress also woke up to reports of the terror attack and some took to Twitter to condemn the attack. One of the only two Muslim members of Congress Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minnesota) condemned the attack and called for unity in the face of violence. ""I condemn the attack in Paris today. My thoughts are with the families of those killed. I urge swift justice for the people responsible,"" Rep. Keith Ellison tweeted. ""The goal of terror is to stoke hatred and division. We must stand united against people who choose violence."" The New York Police Department boosted security measures in New York City, Republican Congressman from New York Peter King told CNN. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia) called the attack a ""horrific situation"" and said the U.S. needs to be ""very vigilant"" on MSNBC. ""There wont be another day in our life that we wont have to be vigilant about terrorist attacks in any place,"" he said. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Florida) called the attackers ""murderous extremists"" on Twitter and Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois also took to Twitter. ""Americans stand united with those around the world who value freedom of speech in mourning the victims of terrorism in Paris today,"" Kirk said. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut) tweeted that he was ""appalled by the attack."" ""My heart goes out to the victims & their families,"" he wrote. And in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) condemned the attacks and pointed to the shared values between the U.S. and France.""Even though it's in France, it's an attack on us,"" Graham said. CNN's Barbara Starr and Alexandra Jaffe contributed to this report.","President Barack Obama addressed the attack, from the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon .

"(CNN)What do you get when you combine Japanese culture, rock and musical theater? Chaos. Or more precisely KAO=S -- a band of spellbinding musicians presenting vivid visual performances unlike anything you may have ever seen. Following the devastating tsunami in 2011, the trio came together with the mission of creating something beautiful out of the turmoil. The result is an unusual musical style that blends the vocals and raw acoustic guitar of frontman Shuji Yamagiri with traditional Japanese instruments like the three-string Tsugaru-shamisen played by a musician known as Jack. The two instrumentalists are accompanied by powerful sword dancing from ""Lady Samurai,"" aka Kaori Kawabuchi. ""Music gives me imagination or inspiration by just listening to it. It's like I tell a story by using my body,"" Kawabuchi says of dancing with a samurai sword known as a katana. ""I get an image from the sound by the (band) members under the conditions on that day, energy given by the audience, and the atmosphere."" Kawabuchi's energetic sword dancing is a fluid, swift selection of movements that translate the musicians' deeply personal sound into a visual spectacle for the band's growing international audience. Since their conception, the band has played several high-profile gigs outside of Japan,  including at the venerated annual SXSW music and media festival in Austin, Texas. They've also completed a tour of the United States as well as performed for fans at festivals in Germany and England. Band leader Yamagiri adds: ""A strength and characteristic of our band is, we have [Kawabuchi] between us, and through her movement, she expresses the feeling of sadness and delight that we try to express in our play, using her body. ""I think it makes it easier for an overseas audience to understand. She can deliver feminine delicacy and tenderness, and also intensity, which is even stronger than men.""

"When I first poked my head inside Virgin Galactic's newest spaceship, I felt a little like I was getting a front-row seat to space history. The company, led by billionaire Richard Branson, allowed CNN unprecedented access to a ""SpaceShipTwo, Serial Two"" spacecraft which was being carefully assembled by workers at a secure facility in the high desert north of Los Angeles. This invention spun from carbon fiber and imagination is designed to fly tourists some 60 miles high to the edge of space. In 2008, Branson predicted the company would be launching paying passengers by 2010. Obviously that hasn't happened yet. Meanwhile, more than 700 people -- reportedly including astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, Justin Bieber and Ashton Kutcher -- are awaiting to gain official status as Space Cowboys. The latest word: Virgin Galactic says it's on track to begin commercial service by the end of this year. ""Rome wasn't built in a day,"" Branson tweeted in January. The spaceship I boarded isn't expected to fly until 2015. I was asked not to take photos or video. From the inside, it looks bigger than you'd expect after seeing its 60-foot-long exterior. For some reason I expected more machinery during assembly. Standing inside the cabin's shell, I found four technicians working away with precision and TLC. There were no furnishings installed yet, so I tried to imagine which of the six seats in the spacecraft would be my choice --  if I could afford a $250,000 ticket. The cabin is dotted with so many windows it blew me away -- a side window and a ceiling window for every passenger. I imagined myself in the front row. Right side. Stepping carefully to the window, I remembered what space travelers have said about the power of seeing the awe-inspiring curvature of the Earth and what a life-changing experience that is. I was sort of projecting that as I stood inside the spaceship. Here's how Virgin Galactic's space tours are supposed to work: Six passengers and two pilots will board a SpaceShipTwo -- a combination rocket and glider. The ship is attached to a powerful airplane, called a WhiteKnightTwo. That plane flies the rocket/gilder up to about 50,000 feet. Then the real fun starts. The pilots separate the spacecraft from the plane. They ignite the spacecraft's rocket engine, creating G-forces that pin passengers back in their seats, according to Virgin Galactic. They'll experience ""eye-watering acceleration"" to nearly 2,500 mph, more than three times the speed of sound. As the ship reaches higher and higher, the cobalt blue sky turns to black. Then: engines off. Silence. Passengers will be allowed out of their seats -- to feel that weightlessness we've all heard so much about. It will be interesting to learn what really happens during the six minutes of weightlessness that Virgin Galactic says passengers will get on each flight. Imagine all six passengers inside this cabin as they're dying to get that space-faring-selfie they can post online for the rest of their lives. I'm wondering: What are the rules in space to get those photos? How is that going to work? Is everyone going to be bumping into each other while they're floating around the cabin? There were four workers in the ship's cabin with me, and I could imagine us all bumping into each other -- accidentally throwing an elbow while we tried to maintain balance and control in zero-G. After the weightless portion of the flight -- if all goes according to plan -- passengers will strap themselves back into their seats before the spacecraft yields to the forces of gravity and begins its glide downward toward sweet Mother Earth. Related: What does a Virgin Galactic ticket get you? Perhaps the real, lasting value of this experience will be what passengers bring back with them. Will it change the way they live here on Earth? Virgin Galactic says its primary goal isn't about pushing the boundaries of space exploration. It's about offering people a chance to gain a new perspective on the world -- literally and figuratively. Will seeing the beauty of the planet shift the way passengers interact with the environment? Will it trigger people to embrace more environmentally sustainable lifestyles and technologies? Whatever the case, the Virgin Galactic website promises: ""Life will never quite be the same again."" As anticipation builds towards the maiden passenger flight, here are seven things about the program you may not know: . 1. Can we call them astronauts? Virgin Galactic refers to its space tourists as ""passenger astronauts."" But Buzz Aldrin doesn't like it. ""I don't think they should be called astronauts,"" Aldrin told CNN in 2010. ""That term was created by the U.S. military. My suggestions would be star-traveler or starflyer."" Aldrin knows from astronauts. Let's not forget he was the the second astronaut to walk on the moon. 2. Chinese nationals are banned from flights . U.S. anti-espionage laws require Virgin Galactic to ban Chinese nationals from its flights, according to the South China Morning Post. Why? Because rocket engines on the Virgin Galactic vessels reportedly are considered military-grade technology under U.S. arms trafficking laws established during the Cold War. The legislation was designed to prevent certain foreign powers, such as China, from getting hold of U.S. military tech secrets. 3. Virgin Galactic accepts Bitcoin . For the unaware: Bitcoin is an experimental form of money that exists only online. It's not regulated by any central authorty. About 12 million Bitcoins have entered circulation. Branson told CNNMoney last January that a ""future astronaut, a female flight attendant from Hawaii, has already purchased her Virgin Galactic ticket using Bitcoins."" 4. Look who's hitching a ride: NASA . As everyone knows, NASA figured out how to go to the moon long ago. Now, after the death of the shuttle program, the legendary space agency is relying on others for transportation. Virgin Galactic has agreed to carry a dozen NASA technology experiments on its first commercial research flight. 5. Should Virgin Galactic partner with Google? Doug Messier, managing editor of the space news site parabolicarc.com, speculates that Virgin Galactic and Google might make a good match to help Google gain a foothold in space. Google already is developing flying wind-turbine technology. 6. DiCaprio's secret seat-mate . At a charity auction last year in France, an anonymous bidder won a Virgin Galactic seat next to actor Leonardo DiCaprio, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Winning bid: $1.5 million. 7. Breakfast in London, lunch in LA . Branson is said to be looking down the road to even more space ventures, including high-speed, point-to-point travel on Earth. Imagine traveling by rocket-plane from London to Singapore in an hour -- or from London to Los Angeles in a couple of hours. With every delay, the global attention on Virgin Galactic intensifies to prove that it will accomplish what it set out to do years ago. I can't wait to see what happens next. We'll keep you posted.","Virgin Galactic space tourism flights are scheduled to begin this year .

"Trust the British to get it right -- in the end.  When it comes to taking stock on London 2012, I believe the London Games will be regarded as having brought the Olympics concept home. Britain has brought the Olympics back to what they have been and should always be. And we did it with that unique common sense for which my country is known. To be sure, the London Games were not as spectacular as, say Beijing. Nor did they have the exotic ""new world"" quality of Sydney so wonderfully laced with Australian freshness. They haven't been the biggest, the brightest, the tallest, the largest, the (you add your own superlative here). Instead, they have been what they were always meant to be -- a celebration of athletic prowess infused with a tremendous sense of fun and good spirit emanating from the host nation's culture. Everything that has been bad about games in recent years was slowly, carefully addressed and ultimately dealt with in London. The opening ceremony set the tone. With its green fields and satanic mills, to the self-deprecating humor from the Monarch herself, London sent the not-so-subtle message: This wasn't going to be ""Olympics as usual."" The Games' big budgets . Montreal finally finished off paying for the 1976 games 30 years later in November 2006.  Athens was twice over budget. And of course, we will never know how much the Beijing games truly cost. In London an original, fictional bid-budget of £2.7 billion ($4.2 billion) was quickly abandoned in 2007 in favor of a realistic, £9.3 billion ($14.6 billion) with a huge contingency for unforeseen costs such as security. To those who criticize the three-times bid-budget, there is one crucial fact to bear in mind. In 2008, like other countries in recession, Britain embarked on stimulus spending. We were fortunate that we actually had real projects and purpose upon which to spend the cash, rather than the bridges and roads to nowhere of other countries.  We didn't have to invent places to spend the money because the Olympics was waiting.  If there was ever a time to have the Olympics, this was it -- when the expenditure was economically needed. In fact, the contingency money allocated has proved to be more than enough. A political row is about to break out over what to do with the £300 million under-spend and whether it should just be handed back to the cash-strapped UK Treasury.  My own view is some of it should be used for a tourism campaign next year to help bring those guests who stayed away fearing the crowds. The Olympic legacy . Olympics today are all about legacy. It was the prospect of regenerating London's derelict East End which helped win the games. Since then billions of pounds have been spent, not just on the facilities per se, but on the infrastructure around them.  And in the city, those of us who live here and have suffered years of weekend closure of tube lines for ""scheduled maintenance"" and ""replacing signals"" can be in no doubt we will reap the benefits once everyone has gone home.  We have a regenerated subway that is once again world-class. So when the IOC President Jacques Rogge said, ""London has created a legacy blueprint"" and ""has raised the bar on how to deliver a lasting legacy,"" we can neatly tick that one off as a rousing success from which other cities can learn. Organizational triumph . From day one, Britain was determined not to have another Wembley fiasco, or Millennium Dome disaster, where it seemed every major construction project ended up delayed, over budget and in acrimony (incidentally the Dome is now the most successful concert venue in Europe as the O2 arena -- so there!) With the Olympics, we simply got on with it. The Aquatics Centre, designed by Zaha Hadid, was completed and tested a year before the games began. The Olympic Stadium had the lights switched on by the Prime Minister back in December and its final test was four months before the opening ceremony. In fact the IOC never did doubt everything would be ready. London has conclusively shown that by being more realistic in ambition, everything can be done without the heartache and angst of previous games. For the British people themselves, there has been a renewed pride in the country -- helped of course by record gold medals.  I accept this might be a mile wide but an inch deep, but I cannot recall the last time I have seen so many people proudly walking the streets with the Union Jack flag wrapped around their shoulders. The legacy of confidence means it is the challenge of politicians and civic leaders to foster that spirit so it doesn't disappear along with the fleeting summer sun. Every time London has hosted the games it has done so in testing times. In 1908 London rescued the Olympics after Mount Vesuvius volcano erupted, causing the selected city of Rome to pull out.  In 1948 London hosted the so-called ""Austerity Games"" three years after the end of WWII. They were the first Olympics in 12 years. So re-establishing the Olympics is something of a tradition here.  To this we now add 2012, where I gently suggest London has subtly re-established the Olympic tradition by bringing back a dose of sanity. We have proved, firstly, that the Olympics are manageable, and affordable, if done right. We have proved they can be fun for everyone (even the people who live in the city). London will probably never host the games again. I was proud to be in the stadium on Saturday night singing our national anthem  after Mo Farah won his second gold medal. Just as I have been proud to be here, in my capital city, to see us get it right and leave a legacy for the city, the country and the games themselves.","Quest: Britain has brought the Olympics Games back a dose of sanity .

"(CNN) -- The Twitter-verse has spoken. 2014 has officially been declared the year of the selfie. According to Twitter's top trends of 2014, that is. The term ""selfie"" has been mentioned more than 92 million times on Twitter -- a 500% increase on 2013, when ""selfie"" was named Oxford Dictionary's word of the year, according to Twitter. Television show host, Ellen Degeneres' star-studded Oscar selfie, dubbed as the ""Golden Tweet,"" was retweeted more than 3 million times, making it the most shared message ever on Twitter.

"I have often thought of European officials as the proverbial ""plate spinners"" from the circus. Those talented artists who balance spinning plates on sticks, ever increasing the number of sticks, rushing from one to the other, giving them a tug and pull to keep them moving, always aware that if they are too slow or too fast, one of the plates will crash to the ground. That is exactly what we have in Europe today. Only the artists are European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, Eurogroup head Jean-Claude Juncker, European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso et al, while the plates are Greece, Spanish banks, Italian deficits, eurobonds and German chancellor Angela Merkel. Two weeks ago it was the Spanish banks which were wobbling -- but a quick tug and push worth €100 billion kept the plate moving. Before that it was the Irish referendum on the fiscal compact.....then it was the Greek election....and the artists now have to stand ready to renegotiate the bailout terms to give Greece breathing room (after giving a tug to the Merkel plate to prevent her falling off in pique). Germany: Is it really the villain? There are some plates that are always spinning: Getting the fiscal compact ratified; the size and strength of the eurozone firewall; the ever present problem of countries in recession. These plates always need attention. But then they are often joined by more plates: The Irish referendum on the compact; the Greek de facto election on the euro. And then there are the plates that suddenly and urgently require immediate attention to prevent a spill. Spanish bond yields are giving great cause for concern. Oh, and don't  forget Italian bond yields. And the European bailout fund needs some attention -- there -- and while you are over there put another plate on a stick, this time call it banking union and get that moving. Family tragedy tells country's story . Sometimes there are so many plates spinning it is difficult to see which one requires the most immediate attention. Is it Spain's banks which have just been promised a huge wodge of cash? Or the French and German banks which will suffer losses if Spanish banks fail? Perhaps it is the German government's intransigence? Of course, what is really important is neither the number nor nature of the plates that are spinning, but rather the competence and ability of the plate spinner. When you watch at the circus, you are not watching the plates, but the artist who is rushing from one to the other -- wondering if they will make it in time to avert a crash. Human cost of Greek crisis . The artists are the European leaders, both at national and European Union level. How good are Messrs Van Rompuy, European council president, and his fellow spinners Barroso, Draghi and Juncker at keeping things going -- along with help from Christine Lagarde, at the International Monetary Fund, and others? The spinners have given us some heart stopping moments, such as when it looked like they would stare down Greece into leaving the euro, or in midnight summits when they seemed unlikely to reach a deal. But the sad fact is that while they are keeping the plates spinning, they are doing very little to actually safely remove any of the plates from the stick and bring the act to a close. Rise and fall of euro . Daily it seems there are more plates spinning, and the antics of the spinners becomes more frantic as they rush from one to the other, ever proclaiming that the act is coming to a close. Unfortunately that is not the case. The plate spinning is likely to continue for some time to come. We all need to hope that this is one act that has the stamina and ability to get to the end.","CNN's Richard Quest: I often think of European officials as the proverbial ""plate spinners""

"Two of the four inmates who escaped through the ceiling in the shower of the Caddo County Jail in Anadarko, Oklahoma, this weekend have been captured, Caddo County Sheriff Gene Cain told CNN on Monday. The two men, Dylan Ray Three Irons, 21, and Prime Brown, 23, were taken into custody in Chickasha, Oklahoma, the sheriff said, less than 20 miles away from the jail. The men were spotted by Grady County District Attorney investigators as they were walking to a convenience store. Both men ""appeared very wet and dirty,"" according to the Grady County Sheriff's Office. The four inmates made a clean getaway Sunday after prying open a maintenance hatch in their shower -- the first escape from the 2-year-old Caddo County jail, Cain said. They broke a lock on the hatch above the shower head, Cain told CNN affiliate KFOR-TV, and then moved through a crawl space until they reached a wall, where they knocked out concrete block or two. That got them to an unlocked door outside the jail area, Cain explained. They apparently kept their clothes on in the shower. Four orange inmate uniforms were found outside the jail, CNN affiliate KOCO-TV reported. Three of the men -- Three Irons, Brown and Anthony James Mendonca, 24 -- had been convicted of methamphetamine offenses and were awaiting transfer to a state prison. The fourth escapee, 32-year-old Triston Cheadle, was awaiting trial on a federal gun charge, KOCO-TV reported. Cheadle and Mendonca remain at large and are considered armed and dangerous.","Both men captured were ""very wet and dirty,"" sheriff says .

"(CNN)Last year, Kim Jong Un received a surreal, breathy birthday serenade. Dennis Rodman belted out ""Happy Birthday"" -- not far from Marilyn Monroe's rendition -- as the Pyongyang crowd clapped in unison during a basketball game. This year's birthday affairs are less likely to be bizarre -- Rodman is not in town. Kim's birthday is believed to fall on January 8, but like most affairs of North Korea, his personal details are opaque. North Korean state media has not acknowledged the exact date of Kim's birth in either of its Korean and English-language archives. ""There is a lot of debate about the year he was born,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute, a Korean think tank. ""Some say it is 1984 while others say is '83 or '82."" In previous years, Kim has distributed sweets to children on January 7 which was a tradition held by his grandfather and father during their birthdays. The birthday of Kim Il Sung, the founder of the country, is considered the Day of the Sun and falls on April 15.  Kim Jong Il's birthday, on February 16,  is known as the Day of the Shining Star. These are the days when residents received goods from the state and children got sweets. The days are marked with pomp and circumstance, including military parades, patriotic chants and oaths of loyalty to the leaders. But the current leader Kim's birthday has been decidedly more low-key during his three years in power. ""There's a lot of speculation why that's the case,"" said Lee Jung Hoon, professor of international relations at Yonsei University in South Korea.  ""Kim could be trying to put out this image as a humble guy, that he's not extravagant. Then there's sort of negative take on this issue, as to he's still very young,  29, 30 or 31. When you start marking his birthday, then the whole North Korean people will start to wonder, then what's his age?"" And revealing his age raises questions about experience. ""It could be because he is a young leader. Being young could have its advantage and disadvantage, but it appears as though he doesn't want to make it public yet,"" said Cheong. Unlike his predecessors, there's little sign that Kim's birthday is a major national holiday. The Kyodo News reported last year that the current North Korean leader's birthday is not likely to be celebrated as a national holiday this year, after it reviewed five North Korean calendars for 2015. And North Korean workers at the joint Kaesong Industrial Complex never have asked for a holiday on January 8 in the past two years, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry, the agency which handles North Korean affairs. His birth date was first revealed by Kenji Fujimoto, the former sushi chef of Kim's father, Kim Jong Il. ""The date is known as accurate, but North Korea never officially confirmed it,"" said Cheong. The Unification Ministry recorded Kim's birthday as January 8, although the exact year of birth is marked as 1982, 1983 or 1984. In Kim's three years in power, he's largely followed the legacies of his father and grandfather, said Lee. A South Korean report that released this week indicated that North Korea could be closer to miniaturizing a nuclear warhead indicating that Kim has continued with the focus on nuclear weapons. And his regime has also been marked by the purge of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who was executed after being branded a traitor in December 2013. ""Unfortunately, there were some hopes because he was educated in Switzerland and that he's young, people hoped that there might be some change. None of that has happened. It might be worse, because he's less experienced than his father and grandfather, and very rash and impatient as we've seen with the cyberattacks,"" Lee said, referring to a Sony hacking scandal in which the FBI blamed North Korea. KJ Kwon reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Madison Park reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","Kim Jong Un's birthday is believed to be January 8 .

"After months of delays, a ""Geneva II"" conference meant to broker an end to the Syrian civil war has been scheduled to begin on January 22 in Geneva, Switzerland, the United Nations said Monday morning. ""At long last and for the first time, the Syrian government and opposition will meet at the negotiation table rather than the battlefield,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a news conference. He added that the goal of the conference includes ""the establishment, based on mutual consent, of a transitional governing body with full executive powers, including over military and security entities."" While he dubbed the U.N.-brokered meeting a ""mission of hope"" and called on both sides to cease violence and release detainees in preparation for the talks, he did not say which parties will attend -- a subject that helped push back the conference for months. Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N. and Arab League special envoy to Syria, echoed Ban's sentiments in a later statement to reporters in Geneva. In regard to the release of detainees, Brahimi specifically mentioned two bishops who were abducted earlier this year, asking, ""Why are they still kept?"" Youhanna Ibrahim, the Syriac Orthodox bishop of Aleppo, and Boulos al-Yaziji, the Greek orthodox metropolitan of Aleppo and Iskenderun, were abducted at gunpoint in April while en route to Aleppo, the National Catholic Reporter says. While Ban declined to answer questions regarding his statement or elaborate on which opposition groups would attend, Brahimi said later that the government and rebels have been asked to name their delegations by the end of the year. In response to questions, Brahimi said Iran and Saudi Arabia could be ""possible participants"" at Geneva II. Pressed more specifically on Iran, he said, ""I don't think I can comment on that. I think we said several times that the secretary general of the United Nations and the secretary general of the Arab League are in favor of inviting Iran."" He added, ""Not all the people who want to come to Geneva will be able to come, but they should know this is not an event. This is a process. And in this process, I'm sure that everybody who wants to participate in rebuilding what I call the new republic of Syria will be able to do so in the course of the process."" The conference would bring representatives from Syria's government and elements of the opposition to negotiate an end to the fighting that has wracked Syria since March 2011. Yet the opposition is hardly a single group; it consists of numerous factions that often oppose each other. The al Qaeda-linked groups Islamic State in Iraq and Jabhat al-Nusra have made substantial gains in Syria in recent months, especially in the north, tilting the balance away from more moderate factions of the rebel Free Syrian Army. Syria's brutal war within a war gains momentum . The conference had been held up in part because many branches of the Syrian opposition said they wouldn't attend, or wouldn't participate without preconditions. Nineteen largely Islamist rebel groups, for example, last month flatly rejected participating. Some groups wanted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down before talks. ""The conflict in Syria has raged for too long. It would be unforgivable not to seize this opportunity to bring an end to the suffering and destruction it has caused,"" the United Nations said in an online statement Monday morning. Al Qaeda advancing in Syria, one town at a time . Martin Nesirky, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, declined to say Monday who has guaranteed they will attend. But he said: ""Given how long it has taken to get to this point,"" just the setting of a date ""is a good sign."" Geneva II is a successor to Geneva I, a June 2012 meeting in which international parties laid out a peace plan for Syria that calls for a transitional governing body. It left open the question of whether al-Assad must leave power. The United States and Russia announced in May that they would try to bring the warring parties to a second conference in Geneva to implement the plan. But the second Geneva conference was delayed several times. In November, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported that Syrian government officials would attend the conference without preconditions and with the goal of stopping violence in the country. The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement. It is now a full-blown civil war. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict, and another 9 million have been displaced. International inspectors, meanwhile, are trying to ensure that Syria eliminates its chemical weapons stockpile by the middle of 2014. Syria agreed to do so under international pressure earlier this year. More than 11,000 Syrian children killed in civil war .

"An unlikely group helped Sen. Thad Cochran capture the Republican nomination in a hotly contested primary runoff, but the strategy that propelled him to victory is unlikely to make it into the GOP playbook. In the final weeks of the election, Cochran's campaign and allies turned to African-Americans and Democrats to carry the incumbent senator past his tea party challenger. Turnout shot up in counties with the highest African-American populations, but Cochran's success with turning out an unlikely demographic will be hard to replicate elsewhere, several Republican strategists said. CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Kevin Madden emphasized that each election should be treated as an independent race with its own strategy. ""I think it would be hard to say this is a sign of something that could be replicated in congressional districts or in races around the country,"" Madden, a former adviser to 2012 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said. A unique scenario played out in Mississippi: Because of the state's open primary system, Democrats were able to help elect the Republican nominee, who is all but certain to win the general election in the solidly Republican state. The contentious race between an incumbent with a pipeline to federal funds and a more conservative challenger with tea party backing jolted blacks into action -- 88% of whom voted for the Democratic nominee in the state's last Senate race in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Lifelong Democrats mobilized for Cochran . States in which the same scenario could play out ""are few and far between,"" GOP strategist and CNN political commentator Alex Castellanos said. ""Until we find such a rare state, it will do a Republican no good to promise more federal spending and benefits to minority voters."" Bringing home the pork . Throughout the campaign, Cochran consistently pointed out his position on the  Senate Appropriations Committee and the multimillion-dollar projects he has funded in Mississippi, some of which bear his name, like the University of Southern Mississippi's Thad Cochran Center. Jackson, Mississippi, also boasts the Jackson Medical Mall Thad Cochran Center -- a formerly run-down mall that an African-American doctor converted into a medical center with Cochran's support, said D'Andra Orey, political science professor at Jackson State University. ""He's done some things that are not black-specific, but things that blacks benefit from,"" Orey said. Many credited Cochran's success at the ballot box to his ability to funnel federal dollars into his state -- the poorest in the country. Henry Barbour, who steered the pro-Cochran super PAC Mississippi Conservatives, said that Cochran's long-standing relationships with the African-American community and ability to meet ""the needs of all the Mississippians"" helped Cochran win. ""It only worked because they had confidence in Sen. Cochran, whether it was a Republican voter we were talking to, an independent voter we were talking to, or even a Democratic voter,"" Barbour acknowledged. But still, Barbour said he does not ""think there's any question"" that the strategy can be applied on a national level. ""We've got to genuinely go into the minority communities and communicate our message and explain to them why it's good for them,"" Barbour said. Barbour called the election an impressive feat given the state's violent history of race relations. Turnout spiked in Hinds County, which is 70% African-American and saw about 7,000 more voters for Cochran in the runoff than in the primary. While boasting a similar share of Cochran supporters, neighboring Madison County -- which is 38% African-American -- delivered much smaller gains for Cochran in the runoff. George Flaggs Jr., the mayor of Vicksburg, backed Cochran and encouraged other Democrats to support him at the polls, largely because his city's economy is anchored in government-funded projects. ""(Sen. Cochran) is a person that demonstrates leadership in terms of helping with jobs and job creation,"" Flaggs said. ""I'm a black Democrat, but I try to be responsive to the needs of the city and the state."" He added that Mississippi would be unable to compete for federal funds with states like New York or California without Cochran's seniority in the Senate. Barbour said he was ""damned proud"" to ask African-Americans and Democrats for their support. ""One of the highlights of the runoff was working with African-Americans in a shared interest in our state,"" Barbour said. ""This is how you grow the party."" Conservative activists slam Cochran for courting Democrats . Is the African-American vote up for grabs? ConservativeBlackChick.com's Crystal Wright said the Mississippi race showed that neither party should take the black vote for granted. ""We don't go out and earn the black vote,"" Wright said of the GOP. ""The only time the Republican Party is serious about going after the black vote is -- it's like the vote of last resort. Blacks have become the vote of last resort and we need to say no more."" Republicans could actually make inroads with African-Americans in the rural and suburban communities of the South, said Ravi K. Perry, a political science professor at Mississippi State University. Perry, who has written extensively about race in politics, said Cochran's outreach to blacks is ""obviously a winning strategy"" and that the runoff showed that there is interest in the African-American community to have an impact on the political process. ""It's not going to be a strategy that you're going to throw away,"" Perry said. He added that many African-Americans are socially conservative and may find Republican candidates appealing, particularly if they can bring home federal dollars for the agriculture industry, which relies on subsidies. ""Democrats should not rest on their laurels and assume that the African-American vote is theirs and the GOP should not assume that it is out of their reach,"" Perry said. Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator Donna Brazile dispelled the idea that Democrats take the African-American vote for granted and said that Democrats are working to recruit and turn out more every election cycle. ""The only legitimate criticism ... is that we wait until the last minute to encourage African-Americans to vote,"" Brazile said. ""But when it comes to encouraging African-Americans to run for office, we're at the table."" But Brazile said the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is making an ""aggressive effort"" to recruit and register African-Americans and other minorities in key states this cycle . DSCC National Press Secretary Justin Barasky said the group is already spending to raise turnout in battleground states to near-2012 levels and will be ""making an unprecedented investment"" to keep the Senate in Democratic hands. Registering and turning out African-Americans will be a key part of this strategy, particularly in Georgia, South Carolina and Louisiana, Barasky said. Forming a more inclusive party . Danny Vargas, former chairman of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly, was wary to draw any broader conclusions from the unique Mississippi runoff, but said the race is a reminder the GOP needs to cast a wider net. ""Nationally, if we ever hope to win back the White House, we need to have an approach that's inclusive of every segment of society,"" Vargas, who is also president of VARCom Solutions, said. ""The poor of our country are not the problem, they're the ones most in need of our solutions."" Vargas suggested the GOP should show how its market-oriented solutions can empower all types of communities. ""You just need to show up. You need to be willing to go to Hispanic bodegas, black churches or mosques,"" he said. Beyond African-Americans, Republicans will also need to draw Hispanic voters to remain a viable party as that population is projected to triple by 2050. John Bruce, chair of the University of Mississippi's political science department, called the runoff an ""exceptional"" case and said no one should expect any significant shifts in racial partisanship. But Cochran's strategy of courting the African-American vote proved successful -- whether because of his record of funding projects in Mississippi or the fear of being represented by someone like McDaniel. ""Anytime something works in politics, someone else will try to copy it,"" Bruce said. McDaniel says 'hundreds' of irregularities found in Mississippi race .

"(CNN)Don't call it a comeback, yet. But if the Texas Knights, a branch of the Ku Klux Klan based in East Texas, get way their way, you could call it that. One recruiter, who asked to be called Henry, says there is a concerted effort to increase their membership. ""There are flier drives, word of mouth, people meeting each other, we reach out to political meetings, to tea party meetings, conservative organizations, everything,""  Henry told CNN. Henry says that in the last few months, he has personally recruited over 40 new members to the Texas Knights. ""Our government considers us domestic terrorists, they consider us right-wing extremists. Because of that ... we wear the robe, the hood, to protect our identities and not to make us a bull's-eye or target from FBI."" Experts who monitor hate groups like the KKK say the results of their efforts yield little fruit, as their ranks are as thin as they've ever been. However, they warn that they still have dangerous potential. ""Just because the Klan's numbers are very small, and their activities have primarily been limited to an occasional gathering or leafleting, doesn't mean that individuals who have been in their orbit can't act violently and commit an attack within the United States. That is the biggest threat now from groups like the Klan,"" said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino. This push for new members has reached far beyond Texas. Recently, from New Jersey to Indiana to California, white supremacists have left literature at the homes of potential sympathizers. In the town of Harrison, Arkansas, the local KKK chapter sponsored a billboard directing the right listeners to tune in to ""White Pride Radio."" As far as racial pride is concerned, KKK recruiter Henry says that ""for me, I love my own people ... there is nothing wrong with blacks (or) African-Americans having their pride; Hispanics have their pride, Orientals. ..."" Despite the scent of equality in his statement, in the same breath, he slams other races as ""lesser people."" Those who monitor these types of extremist groups say their numbers are nowhere near where they were in their heyday in the 1920s, when they boasted nearly 5 million members. Levin says the Klan has a membership of about 5,000. The Southern Poverty Law Center gives a lower estimate of around 3,000. Henry claims that's exactly what he and his compatriots want outsiders to believe. ""We want the public to see us as a shadow, not to know where we are. That's how it should be.""

"""Very busy lately, huh?"" Lao Liu greets me one morning on my way to work. ""What's going on with this Chen Guangcheng guy?"" My friend, who works for a multinational company, had heard chatter about Chen and wanted to find out more. I was in a rush so I told him quickly about Chen, the blind activist from a rural town in Shandong who has been mistreated for years by local officials, and how he had slipped into the U.S. embassy in Beijing creating a diplomatic spat with China. Lao Liu is not alone. Many ordinary Chinese have been in the dark about Chen's dramatic escape. China: Chen can apply to study in U.S. On May 2, six days after Chen had slipped into the U.S. embassy, the state-run Xinhua news agency declared China was demanding an apology from the U.S. for giving refuge to a Chinese citizen ""via abnormal means."" During a regular press briefing, foreign ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said the Chinese side was ""strongly dissatisfied with the move."" U.S. officials 'exploring all options' He added: ""What the U.S. side has done has interfered in the domestic affairs of China and the Chinese side will never accept it."" But many Chinese were baffled by Liu's protests because they knew very little about Chen and his story. For days Chinese censors have blocked online posts that mention Chen's name, or words related to the lawyer like ""blind."" They have also ordered the Chinese media to stay away from Chen's story and have selectively blacked out international reports about Chen from networks such as CNN. Lawyer, friend: Chen wants his rights . ""Who is this person?"" asked netizen Leo Liu Ying on Weibo, one of China's Twitter-like social networking sites. ""We want the real story!"" Netizens demanded to know what Chen did, why he wanted to go to the U.S. embassy and how he got there. Postings on Weibo are eventually scrubbed, but the few we read show a range of opinions. Some supported the official line. ""China's internal affairs should be solved by Chinese ourselves, no need to have Americans worry about these,"" said Yutou0001. Others were more circumspect. ""One should not engage in activities incompatible with one's job,"" wrote Fuguideshi. ""But basic humanitarianism and universal human rights have no borders."" U.S. 'mission impossible' diplomacy . But a post from ""GhostInTheHell"" was scathingly sarcastic. ""May I ask the spokesman of the nation of rule of law: what is the legal basis of deleting posts of Mr. Chen? ""What is the legal basis of putting him on house arrest for years, for beating him up, for harassing his family, for preventing him to get medical treatment, for allowing his daughter to go to school?"" A few netizens were dismissive of Chen's move. ""Chinese who have grievances towards the government may now go into the embassy and throw themselves into the arms of the Yankees,"" wrote Hacken. But for many people, Chen had single-handedly hijacked the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (SED), a two-day meeting that ended Friday. The SED brings together top officials from both countries, including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her Chinese counterpart, Dai Bingguo. They discuss a range of complex bilateral issues, including trade and investment, cross-border crime, military and strategic concerns, as well as global issues like North Korea, Syria, and Iran. This year's SED is particularly important, just months away from a presidential election in the U.S. and a once-in-a-decade change of leadership in China, when ""stability and smooth transition are the watchwords,"" according to Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a corporate strategist and author of ""How China's Leaders Think"". ""Although the SED dealt with the most sensitive military and security matters, it was largely ignored by the world's media because of the solitary acts of a blind human rights activist,"" Kuhn said. The Chen story has shone a bright light on China's repressive practices. Yet Beijing is asking for an apology from Washington. ""They are likely asking for an apology because it diverts attention from their obvious embarrassment and shows strength in the face of severe American criticism over human rights,"" said Kuhn. ""Yet the fact that Chen is now contradicting U.S. officials -- such that, red-faced, they are having to justify their actions in releasing him -- works to reduce China's embarrassment."" This strange turn of events has raised all sorts of unpleasant questions about the way U.S. officials have handled the affair. The Obama administration risks accusations that it is kowtowing to a repressive Chinese government at a time when democratic reform and regime change has taken place across much of the world in the last year. Washington is also vulnerable to criticism that it is furthering strategic and economic interests in China to the detriment of America's broader goal of supporting democracy and freedom overseas. China watchers expect a brief diplomatic standoff. U.S. officials, they say, will continue to criticize ""Chinese human rights"" as judged by American values, and their Chinese counterparts will continue to condemn ""American interference in China's internal affairs,"" as judged by China's sense of sovereignty. ""Yet both sides will continue to reach beyond the rhetoric and deal with international stability and economic growth,"" said Kuhn. Beijing and Washington, after all, have resolved serious diplomatic crises in the past two decades. These include the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999, and the spy plane collision in 2001. During these crises, American and Chinese diplomats worked out carefully worded agreements that would allow leeway for each side to ""explain"" the resolution in terms that would be acceptable to their own people. Clinton's forceful statements about protecting human rights and China's unequivocal assertions about protecting Chinese sovereignty illustrate this point. Observers regard such tough talk as a prerequisite toward a compromise solution, which could see Chen seeking further medical treatment in the U.S. -- a ""face-saving"" way to allow the blind activist and family to leave China, as he now says he wishes.","Many ordinary Chinese have been in the dark about Chen Guangcheng's dramatic escape .

"Washington (CNN) -- Massachusetts Sen.-elect Scott Brown arrived on Capitol Hill on Thursday, two days after pulling off a once-unthinkable victory that has bolstered Republicans nationwide and reformulated the political calculus in Washington. Brown was scheduled to meet with several senior Republican and Democratic senators. During his visit, he took on the aura of a virtual celebrity, surrounded by dozens of reporters, aides, and well-wishers. Brown, a state senator who defeated Democratic state Attorney General Martha Coakley on Tuesday, is the first Massachusetts Republican to win a U.S. Senate race since 1972. His win stripped Democrats of their filibuster-proof 60-seat Senate supermajority and has forced the Obama White House to reconsider its options for passing a health care bill. One of the problems with Washington is that ""there seems to be no transparency"" on health care negotiations and other issues, Brown told reporters. ""People are outraged by that. Just do everything aboveboard. That's what this place is about. This is the best place in the world when it comes to solving problems, and we've kind of lost our way,"" he added. Brown's first meeting was with Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, was an early backer of Brown's bid to fill the last three years of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy's term. McCain, through his ""Country First"" political action committee, has called on Democrats to seat Brown immediately. Brown represents ""the dreams and the hopes and the frustrations that Americans feel today,"" McCain said. ""They want the kind of leadership that the commonwealth of Massachusetts just sent us."" Brown also met with John Kerry, the senior senator from Massachusetts. In the last week of the heated campaign, Kerry, the Democrats' 2004 presidential nominee, accused Brown supporters of ""bullying and threats"" and urged Brown to speak out and get his supporters under control. The two senators had a friendlier exchange Thursday, however, with Kerry expressing hope that Brown will be seated soon. ""I think seating Scott Brown as expeditiously as possible is important. We want to respect the election results,"" Kerry said. Asked when he expects to take office, Brown said he is ""anticipating sometime next week."" WCVB:  Brown 'excited, ready' to hit Washington . Brown was also slated to meet with both Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. ""It's safe to say on behalf of the Republican conference we are really, really happy to have him here,"" McConnell said. ""He's ready to get to work and we're ready to help him get started."" Also on Brown's schedule: a meeting with interim Massachusetts Sen. Paul Kirk, the man Brown will replace. Kirk, a longtime friend and trusted aide to Kennedy, was tapped to temporarily replace the late senator. Kirk has said he hopes to make the transition as smooth as possible. Asked for his views Thursday on the suddenly-reeling health care reform legislation, Brown promised to ""look at every bill and make a rational decision."" Watch Brown talk to CNN about his thoughts on health care . Brown said that while ""everybody deserves some form of coverage,"" he's ""not in favor of the one-size-fits-all"" plan. ""I'm more of a states' rights person,"" he said. The plan being pushed by Democrats before his election wasn't good for his home state, Brown argued. Massachusetts residents shouldn't ""pay higher taxes and have half a trillion in [Medicare] cuts and basically be subsidizing places like Nebraska when we already have 98 percent of our people insured,"" he said. ""We have a very good plan. It didn't make sense."" Massachusetts implemented its own health care reform bill in 2006.

"(CNN) -- At least two confirmed tornadoes descended upon towns in western Massachusetts on Wednesday, leaving at least four dead and smashing homes and buildings across a 40-mile stretch, state officials and witnesses reported. One person was killed in Springfield, two in nearby Westfield and one in Brimfield, about 20 miles east, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick told reporters Wednesday night. The storms struck shortly after 4 p.m. in Springfield, about 90 miles west of Boston. Dylan McDonald told CNN he watched the tornado knock down trees and scatter debris across town as he was driving with a co-worker. ""As the light turned green, a tree fell and everything took off,"" McDonald said. ""We saw a roof fly off an apartment building. The car was tilting, but didn't turn over."" As many as 19 communities reported tornado damage Wednesday evening, Patrick said. The governor declared a state of emergency as the storm system that spawned those twisters moved east, with watches posted all the way to the Atlantic coast until late Wednesday. ""It's been particularly devastating in downtown Springfield,"" Patrick said. And he said a local official told him, ""You have to see Monson to believe it."" Monson resident Dolly Opper said state police were setting up roadblocks around the town, and a neighbor described the town's center as ""war zone."" ""I haven't been home,"" she said. ""The steeple's off the church across the street. It's lying right in the front yard."" At J.T.'s Sports Pub, on Springfield's Main Street, owner Keith Makarowski said he and the 10 or so patrons intially went outside to watch the darkening skies -- then retreated as the storm blew into downtown. ""There was a ton of debris flying around, lots of roof shingles and random siding,"" Makarowski said. Several century-old buildings were damaged -- ""roofs torn off, facades ravaged, trees uprooted"" -- and a woman across the street was blown up against a building after being caught outside. ""Luckily, two people from inside the building were able to pull her in, and she seemed like she was OK,"" Makarowski said. Massachusetts State Police Sgt. Michael Popovics said Springfield, Monson, Westfield and seven other towns -- Agawam, Charlton, Oxford, Palmer, Sturbridge, West Springfield and Wilbraham -- reported severe damage. Sandra Ahearn, a spokeswoman for the Western Massachusetts Electric Co., said 12,000 customers were without power in the utility's service area and that hard-hit areas might not have electricity until the end of the week. Patrick said he has mobilized 1,000 National Guard troops to assist with cleanup and search-and-rescue operations. The Massachusetts State Police said it had activated dog teams to look for people in damaged buildings and described many streets in Springfield as ""impassable"" due to fallen power lines and trees. The damage came amid a wave of heavy thunderstorms that moved through the Northeast on Wednesday afternoon. Tornado watches were also issued for northern Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Maine until 11 p.m. Wednesday. Though not as tornado-prone as much of the Midwest or South, Massachusetts has averaged two to three twisters per year since 1950, according to figures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In 1953, a massive tornado that struck Worcester and nearby towns killed 90 people, according to NOAA; the last tornado to hit the state was in 2008. CNN's Jennifer Westhoven, Anna Gonzalez, Matt Smith, Leigh Remizowski, Julia Talanova and Sean Morris contributed to this report.","NEW: ""There was a ton of debris flying around,"" a witness says .

"(CNN)The FBI is investigating an explosion outside a local NAACP chapter in Colorado. A makeshift bomb, or improvised explosive device, detonated Tuesday morning but failed to ignite a gasoline can placed alongside it. No one was injured, but the incident left some shaken in Colorado Springs. ""All of a sudden I heard this big boom,"" one witness told CNN affiliate KDVR-TV in Denver. ""There was smoke everywhere; the building on the side was burnt."" The witness continued:  ""Whoever did it took off right away though. That's all I heard and it was scary."" The FBI's Denver office said it's looking for a balding man, about 40, who was seen leaving the scene in a white pickup with a missing or covered license plate. Another witness, Julie Skufca, told KDVR that she stared at a man as he drove away calmly. ""(It) kind of made your heart stop, especially when you have kids,"" she told the station. ""He was a heavier white man with what looked like a (Carhartt jacket)"" she added. ""Just driving normal like it was a normal day."" The FBI has not said if the NAACP was targeted. But some pointed out that the other building tenant, Mr. G's Hair Design Studios, likely was not. ""Who would want to bomb a beauty salon?"" one member of the local NAACP chapter told CNN affiliate KCNC-TV in Denver. Henry D. Allen Jr., the branch's president, also raised the specter of a targeted attack, telling KCNC, ""Apparently, we're doing something correct. Apparently, we have gotten someone's attention that we are working toward civil rights for all. That is making some people uncomfortable."" The NAACP is the nation's oldest civil rights organization. The group's national office says it is looking forward to a ""thorough investigation"" into the explosion by national and local authorities. The FBI has asked that anyone with information call its Denver tip line at 303-435-7787.

"(CNN)A deadly gun attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo has shocked France. And while no one has yet claimed responsibility, a history of threats over the magazine's controversial coverage of Islam fueled immediate speculation that Islamic extremists were to blame. Adding weight to that suspicion is video taken by a journalist for the Premieres Lignes news agency which showed the gunmen shouting ""Allahu Akbar!"" (Arabic for ""God is great!"") as they began the attack. They also shouted, in French, that they were avenging the prophet, according to Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins. If the attackers are confirmed as Islamist extremists, it will be the latest tragic example of the growing threat posed by radical Islam in Europe. France, which has the largest Muslim population in Western Europe and an interventionist foreign policy, has already been at the sharp end of such violence. Just last month, two attacks were carried out in the space of a weekend, apparently motivated by Islamist extremism. In one, a 20-year-old French-Burundian posted the ISIS flag on his Facebook page, then entered a police station in the Tours suburbs, shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" and wounded three police officers before a fourth shot him dead. A day later, a 40-year-old French-North African with a long history of psychiatric problems shouted the same words as he plowed into pedestrians in Dijon, injuring 11 people before being arrested after a police chase. The deceased Tours knife attacker -- a convert named Bertrand Nzohabonayo -- appears to have been a lone wolf inspired by but not directly connected to ISIS. According to French media reports, his brother had been on the radar screen of French security services, suspected of wanting to wage jihad in Syria. In March 2012, Mohammed Merah, a self-styled al Qaeda jihadist, killed seven people -- including soldiers and Jewish children -- in a series of attacks in the southwestern city of Toulouse. French extremists have also been active beyond their country's borders. Mehdi Nemmouche, a Frenchman accused of the deadly shooting at Belgium's Jewish Museum in May, recently spent a year in Syria and is a radicalized Islamist, according to French officials. Prosecutors say that when police arrested Nemmouche in France, they also seized a Kalashnikov rifle wrapped in a flag bearing the ISIS insignia. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said last month that his country had never faced a greater terrorist threat. Nearly 400 French extremists are fighting alongside jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq, according to French officials last month, with more on their way. Meanwhile, 234 have left the conflict zone, with 185 now back in France. French police say they have thwarted five terror plots since the summer of 2013. European officials say the threat of terrorist attack in the European Union is greater than at any time since 9/11 because of the emergence of jihadist safe havens in Syria and Iraq, according to CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. But no country faces a greater terrorist threat than France, he said, with support for ISIS running deep among disenfranchised immigrant communities in the run-down, crime-ridden banlieues, or suburbs, that surround many French towns. Adding fuel to the fire, France joined the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS last year. The French military is also involved in fighting Islamist extremists in the African nation of Mali. Following the expansion of the coalition bombing campaign into Syria, a senior ISIS leader for the first time called for attacks against Western citizens. He specifically urged lone-wolf attacks in the United States and France -- two countries that had already been conducting airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. And the group singled out what it called ""the spiteful and filthy French"" for punishment. Alisa Lockwood, head of Europe analysis at IHS Country Risk, said that while it was too early to be sure who was behind Wednesday's attack, the range of potential suspects is limited. ""Neither anarchists nor the extreme right would have an obvious motive to target the magazine, and intimidation or extortion by organised crime would be highly unlikely to take the form of such an attack,"" she wrote in an analysis. ""On the other hand, Islamic State has explicitly threatened to attack French citizens and Al-Qaeda may also have the motivation."" The risk of such an attack has increased since France joined the coalition against ISIS, she wrote, adding: ""France has a long history of jihadist militancy, while exclusion of migrants, French foreign policy and domestic secularism are all drivers of radicalisation."" A U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN that U.S. counterterrorism agencies are looking at a number of groups as possibly being responsible, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, ISIS, and core al Qaeda. Britain has also been a target in recent years of violent attacks by Islamist extremists. In May 2013, a soldier was killed in the street in southeast London in a bloody attack by two converts to Islam who ran him down with a car before attacking him with a machete. They are both now serving long prison sentences. Cell phone footage replayed in court showed one, Michael Adebolajo, still clutching a meat cleaver in his bloody hands, ranting that the killing was ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" for British soldiers killing Muslims overseas. Britain raised its terror threat level to severe last summer. And UK Home Secretary Theresa May, outlining new counterextremism policies in November, highlighted the threat posed by extremists returning from Iraq and Syria. More than 500 have traveled there from Britain, she said, joining ""thousands"" from other European and Western nations. ""When the security and intelligence agencies tell us that the threat we face is now more dangerous than at any time before or since 9/11, we should take notice,"" she said. Going farther back in time, the July 2005 bomb attacks on London's public transit network left more than 50 people dead and hundreds more injured. The four men who carried out the attack were Muslims, one a convert. Spain's public transit system, too, has been in the sights of suspected Islamist extremists. In 2004, the bombings of commuter trains killed 191 people and injured 1,800. Islamic militants with possible ties to al Qaeda were designated later as the prime suspects. The Netherlands has also been impacted by extremism. In 2004, Dutch director Theo van Gogh was stabbed to death by a member of a radical Islamic group after his short film ""Submission"" used verses from the Quran written on women's bodies to criticize the treatment of women in some Islamic cultures. Newspapers in Norway and Denmark prompted furious demonstrations around the world in 2005 when they ran cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed. Any depiction of Islam's prophet is considered blasphemy by many Muslims. Despite, or perhaps because of, the rising tensions, Charlie Hebdo -- which also satirizes Christianity and other faiths -- also published cartoons of Mohammed, spurring protests and the burning of the magazine's office three years ago. Its last tweet before Wednesday's attack featured a cartoon of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and the words, ""And, above all, health."" French President Francois Hollande appealed for national unity Wednesday as France confronts perhaps the worst terror attack ever seen on its soil. But he made no bones about calling it a terror attack and said the country's security alert level had been boosted as police hunt the gunmen. ""We knew that we were threatened like other countries in the world,"" he said. ""We are threatened because we are a country of freedom."" Paris-based security expert Jean-Charles Brisard described the attack as ""obviously an act of war."" And he warned that it was probably only the first in the current climate, with others still to come. Dominique Moisi, a French political scientist, told CNN that the attack was an assault on some of the nation's key values: a free press, democracy, transparency. But while it's shocking, he said, at the same time he was not surprised. ""There was an expectation in Paris, a fear, that an attack was about to occur. Police officers were saying it's not whether an attack will take place but when, that is the only question,"" he said. ""And of course Charlie Hebdo was one of the likely targets of the terrorists."" France can expect strong support from its European neighbors as it hunts those responsible. ""This is an attack on all of us, on our fundamental values, on the freedoms our #EU societies are built upon,"" European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said on Twitter via a spokeswoman. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and UK Prime Minister David Cameron also gave their backing. ""We stand with the French people in the fight against terror and defending the freedom of the press,"" said Cameron. Charlie Hebdo: Satirical magazine is no stranger to controversy .

"(CNN)By the end of today, an average of six people will have died from alcohol poisoning, and it's a ""surprising group"" that's dying more than any other, according to new research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That adds up to an average of 2,221 people in the United States -- a conservative estimate, according to the CDC — dying annually, making it one of the leading preventable causes of death.  The numbers come from death certificate data collected from 2010 to 2012. Alcohol poisoning is when a person consumes a toxic amount of alcohol, usually after a binge of drinking. Typically, ""binge drinking"" for men involves consuming five or more alcoholic beverages in two to three hours, according to the CDC. For women it's drinking four or more in that same period. However, earlier research shows most of the 38 million or more Americans who admit to binge drinking say they actually drink about eight drinks in two to three hours and they do this on average four times per month. When you are suffering from alcohol poisoning, your liver can't keep up with the amount of alcohol in your body. Alcohol is a toxin and the liver has to filter it out of your blood. What the liver can't filter out backs up into your bloodstream. If the blood alcohol concentration in your bloodstream becomes too high, it has a severe impact on your mental and physical self. Your breathing could slow down and so could your heartbeat and your gag reflex. If these don't work correctly, you could lose your breath and pass out or you could stop breathing. Alcohol poisoning can also cause you to choke or cause your heart rhythm to become erratic. You could slip into a coma.  Other signs that someone may be suffering alcohol poisoning include severely slurred speech, loss of coordination and vomiting. While college students get a bad rap for binge drinking, the study found it's not typically college age people who die from drinking too much. In what the CDC said was a surprise, it found that white men between the ages of 35 and 64 are dying most often from alcohol poisoning. That demographic accounts for 76% of the deaths. American Indians/Alaska Natives have the most alcohol poisoning deaths per million people, according to the report. Alaska has the most alcohol poisoning deaths per million people, while Alabama has the least. Thirty percent of the people who died were considered alcoholics. Alcohol-attributed deaths cost the country in terms of workplace productivity and in the number of accidents they cause, which cost about $223.5 billion, according to 2006 figures. Ileana Arias, the CDC's principal deputy director who helped release the report, called Tuesday for more effective programs and policies to prevent binge drinking. If you do drink, there are some benefits to a moderate consumption of alcohol. ""Moderate"" is considered up to one drink a day for women or up to two drinks a day for men. Arias said binge drinking is a serious and ""critical health issue facing this nation.""","Binge drinking can cause alcohol poisoning .

"(CNN)An Ohio man with a knife was shot and killed Wednesday after lunging at one airport police officer and acting in a threatening manner toward another officer, a Columbus police sergeant said. Sgt. Rich Weiner said the man tried to buy a ticket with a woman's identification at Port Columbus International Airport, then with his own ID, but was refused. The man, who was in his early 40s and lived in the Columbus area, returned to his car, where one officer was investigating a suspicious vehicle call. The man and the officer were talking, police said, when the suspect pulled a knife and tried to attack the officer, who opened fire. It is unclear whether the man was struck by any of the shots from the officer, but he fell, then stood up. As he made his way toward the terminal, backup officers approached. The man, who still had a knife in his hand, was shot by one of those officers. Weiner only said that multiple shots were fired. He didn't disclose how many times the man was struck. The suspect had other knives hidden in his clothes, Weiner said. ""It's too early to talk about terrorism,"" Weiner said when asked by reporters about possible motives. ""At this point, this is just a violent encounter between an armed man and the officers here."" Police refused to say at what airline counter the man had tried to purchase a ticket and where he intended to fly. The names of the man who was killed and the police officer who shot him were not immediately released. A bomb squad examined the car and objects on the man that raised alarm, Weiner said. The incident was recorded on surveillance video, but it was not released.

"Washington (CNN)The day after 25 House Republicans attempted to prevent Speaker John Boehner from getting a third term, Boehner says he's starting ""a family conversation"" with his critics. The Speaker and his allies were furious with GOP members who publicly rebuked him on the opening day of the new session of Congress. In front of live television cameras they voted for someone else or declined to back him for the job. Hours after the vote the message was clear that those defectors would be punished. Two Florida Republicans who opposed Boehner - Rep. Daniel Webster, who got 12 votes for his own bid to become Speaker, and Rep. Richard Nugent, who voted for him - were removed from serving on the House Rules committee. That panel is essentially an extension of the Speaker's office since it decides which bills go to the floor and sets parameters for debate. Boehner left the door open Webster and Nugent might return to the committee. He discussed the divisive vote and a closed door meeting of all House Republicans on Wednesday morning, and told reporters afterwards, ""I have not had a chance to talk to them."" ""We're going to have a family conversation, which we had this morning, about bringing our team together,"" Boehner said. ""And I expect those conversations over the next couple of days will continue and we'll come to a decision about how we go forward."" But during the morning session, several of Boehner's allies stood up and urged the Speaker not to give these members a second chance. They argued there should be consequences for those who publicly embarrassed the Speaker on the day the Republicans were taking control of both chambers of Congress. Louisiana Rep. John Fleming, who voted for Boehner but has clashed with him in the past, cautioned against further sanctions. ""I think retaliation and revenge is the wrong way to go on this. Emotions and personalities begin to get into the mix and I think that begins to work against us,"" Fleming said. Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert, who campaigned to replace Boehner as Speaker, agreed that moves to exact revenge would make any effort to unify House Republicans harder. ""There's going to be a fight,"" Gohmert said. Multiple House GOP sources told CNN that prior to the vote for Speaker, they had a good idea of the group that would vote for other candidates. But they were particularly disappointed at those Republicans who joined the rebels, saying some votes blindsided them. New Jersey GOP Rep. Scott Garrett told reporters he did discuss his plans to back someone else with GOP leaders before the vote. He said ""I'm looking forward to doing my job on the Budget committee, I'm looking forward to doing my job on the Financial Services Committee."" As for the prospects that he might lose one of those positions Garrett said, ""I don't think that's the nature of John Boehner."" Boehner, when asked if there would be further repercussions for those who opposed him, only said ""we're going to continue to have a family conversation.""","More than two dozen Republicans voted against Boehner gaining another term as Speaker .

"The fate of three U.S. citizens who have disappeared or been imprisoned in Iran was discussed during Friday's historic conversation between the two nations' presidents, a senior U.S. administration official said. U.S. President Barack Obama, during his phone call with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, ""noted our concern about three American citizens who have been held within Iran -- Robert Levinson, Saeed Abedini, and Amir Hekmati -- and noted our interest in seeing those Americans reunited with their families,"" the official said. Two of the Americans have been tried and convicted in Iranian courts, and the whereabouts of another have been unknown for more than six years. Here are the most recent developments in the stories of the detained U.S. citizens: . Bob LevinsonThe family of Levinson, a retired FBI agent, has been anxiously waiting for news, any news, about his fate since he vanished during a business trip to Iran in March 2007. When Rouhani, Iran's new president, arrived in New York, Levinson's wife and children were watching closely for a sign that efforts to find Levinson might move forward. During an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Rouhani offered little when asked what he can tell Levinson's family. ""We don't know where he is, who he is,"" Rouhani said. ""He is an American who has disappeared. We have no news of him."" Yet, like former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Rouhani spoke of cooperation. ""We are willing to help, and all the intelligence services in the region can come together to gather information about him to find his whereabouts,"" Rouhani told Amanpour. ""And we're willing to cooperate on that."" The State Department has said Levinson is believed to be held in southwest Asia. ""We have every reason to believe that he's alive and that the Iranians control his fate,"" a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN, a departure from last year when the same source described Levinson as ""alive and well."" Questions about his health also remain unanswered. Levinson suffers from diabetes. Levinson's family said Rouhani's comments, while not directly acknowledging information about Levinson, ""are consistent with the commitments made in the past, and [they hope] those promises turn into results."" Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the State Department said Rouhani's comments about cooperation were welcome. ""We look forward to hearing more specifics on how Iran can help in reuniting Mr. Levinson with his family in the United States as soon as possible."" Both the State Department and Levinson's family deny he was working for the government when he disappeared. The family says Levinson was there on private business investigating cigarette smuggling. In January, the family released so-called ""proof of life photos"" they received a few years ago. The photos show him with long, unkempt hair and wearing an orange shirt. He is holding signs written in poor English, including one that reads. "" Why you can not help me?"" An FBI task force meets regularly to assess Levinson's case. ""The FBI remains committed to doing all we can to bring Bob Levinson home safely to his family,"" a statement reads. This summer, the FBI began publishing ads in Farsi publications in Los Angeles and Washington, which have large Iranian-American populations, requesting any information about Levinson, to raise awareness, and advertising a $1 million reward announced by former FBI Director Robert Mueller in 2012. In November, Levinson will become one of the longest-held Americans in history passing the 2,454 days Terry Anderson spent in captivity before being freed by Islamic militants in Lebanon in 1991. Saeed Abedini . In a news release Friday from the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), Abedini's wife, Naghmeh, was quoted as saying she was ""very grateful to President Obama for standing up for Saeed and for the other Americans who are held captive in Iran."" ""I urge President Rouhani, as I have done throughout this week, to release Saeed so he can return to our home and our family in the United States."" The ACLJ is a conservative Christian law firm and advocacy group founded by television evangelist Pat Robertson. It has campaigned widely for Abedini's release. Abedini, a Christian pastor, was sentenced to eight years in prison earlier this year, accused of attempting to undermine the Iranian government. At the time he was convicted, his wife said Abedini had been arrested by Iranian authorities nearly 10 times before, and had agreed during one detention to stop supporting Christian home churches, and had subsequently taken nine trips to the Islamic republic before he was arrested again in July 2012. Amir Hekmati . Hekmati, a 29-year-old former U.S. Marine, has been jailed in Iran since 2011 and accused of being a CIA spy. Earlier this month, he said in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry that a confession he made nearly two years ago came under duress. Born in Arizona and raised in Nebraska before settling with his family in Flint, Michigan, Hekmati joined the Marines in 2001 out of high school. He finished his service four years later as a decorated combat veteran with tours in Iraq. Afterward, he translated Arabic as a contractor and helped train troops in cultural sensitivity. Hekmati's family said he had gone to Iran to visit his grandmother but was arrested in August 2011, accused by Iran's Intelligence Ministry of working as a CIA agent. In December 2011, Hekmati appeared on Iranian state television maintaining that he had been sent to Iran by the CIA, but in his letter to Kerry, published on September 11 in the Guardian, he said he had been held ""on false charges based solely on confessions obtained by force, threats, miserable prison conditions, and prolonged periods of solitary confinement."" ""This is part of a propaganda and hostage taking effort by Iranian intelligence to secure the release of Iranians abroad being held on security-related charges,"" Hekmati's letter stated. The Guardian reported that the letter had been smuggled out of jail. Hekmati's family vouched for the letter's authenticity to CNN.","Presidents Obama and Rouhani discussed three Americans, administration official says .

"(CNN) -- An American Airlines plane en route from Seoul, South Korea to Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas diverted to Narita, Japan, Tuesday after several passengers and crew were injured by turbulence during the flight. American Flight 280 departed Incheon International Airport near Seoul in route to Dallas-Fort Worth when an intense winter storm shook the cabin and caused injuries that forced the aircraft to divert.

"(CNN)Barely two weeks into his term, Taipei's new mayor has sparked debate across Taiwan and China with a simple act: a trip on the subway. On the evening of January 2, a passenger photographed Mayor Ko Wen-Je traveling on a Taipei's MRT train at night, standing alone and leaning next to the door. Once posted on Facebook, the photo went viral in Taiwan, where it touched a nerve with citizens accustomed to politicians traveling in splendor. ""The mayor is so close to the people,"" said one top-rated comment. Another user quipped the mayor commuted with a ""BMW"" -- Bicycle, MRT train, and Walking. The mayor's wife confirmed the sighting in a Facebook post, adding that she had been traveling with the mayor, but took a seat while he remained standing. But some expressed concerns for the mayor's safety: last year, a vicious knife attack on Taipei's subway system left four people dead. Chinese users react . In China, the photo was published in state news media, where it quickly spread among Internet users, touching off a debate on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging platform. ""See this? If Chinese people also had the right to vote, mayors would receive the same treatment, with no privileged car, no crowd following them everywhere, no flashbulbs... nothing."" wrote Pu Baoyi, a Chinese political commentator. ""Some in China would call this the 'corrupted way.'"" But some Chinese social media users accused the Taiwanese mayor of insincerity. ""This actually isn't such a mature display of politics,"" said another Weibo user. ""Politicians' responsibility lies in implementing policies... not putting on a show."" Chinese government officials — even those holding lower-level posts — are known for traveling in luxury motorcades with heavy security detail. In 2011, Chinese media reacted with surprise when the United States' newly-appointed ambassador to China, Gary Locke, was photographed at an airport Starbucks without any security and carrying his own backpack. Mayor: I won't be a 'celebrity' For many in Taiwan, Taipei's new mayor represents an exciting departure from established politics. A former emergency room doctor and political newcomer with no party affiliation, Ko defeated Sean Lien, the wealthy son of Taiwan's former vice president and a member of the establishment Kuomintang political party, which favors closer ties with Beijing. Ko has vowed to crack down on corruption and increase transparency. The mayor has asked top officials to begin reporting their attendance at banquets and weddings, and has vowed not to attend social events as the city's leader. ""A mayor should spend more time on administration, not being a celebrity,"" he wrote on his Facebook account in December.

"President Barack Obama talked with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a call Tuesday night about the threat posed by Iran's nuclear program, according to a White House statement. Obama placed the call to Netanyahu, a senior administration official told CNN. The one-paragraph statement from the White House, which referred to the Obama-Netanyahu discussion as ""a part of their ongoing consultations,"" followed reports earlier in the day that the White House had rejected a request by Netanyahu to meet with Obama this month to discuss Iran's nuclear program. CNN's Wolf Blitzer, citing Israeli sources, reported that the Israelis were told Obama's schedule would not permit a meeting even though Israel offered to have Netanyahu travel to Washington. Obama and Netanyahu are both due to address the United Nations in New York in late September but not at the same time. The Obama administration pushed back later Tuesday. ""Contrary to reports in the press, there was never a request for Prime Minister Netanyahu to meet with President Obama in Washington, nor was a request for a meeting ever denied,"" the White House said Tuesday night in its statement, which made reference to ""our close cooperation on Iran and other security issues."" Netanyahu has shown growing impatience with what he says is a lack of clarity by the Obama administration on articulating so-called ""red lines"" that Iran cannot cross if it wants to avoid war over its nuclear ambitions. The administration has resisted pressure to take that step. U.S. intelligence officials have said they do not believe Iran has decided to develop a nuclear weapon, even as evidence continues to mount that they are improving their ability to do so. Iran said its intentions are peaceful. Atomic enrichment in and of itself is not the red line, a U.S. official told CNN. But Israel feels a sense of urgency with negotiations aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions failing to produce an agreement and sanctions falling short of their intended effect. Concerns in Washington that Israel could launch a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities prompted a wave of visits this summer to Israel by several top Obama administration officials. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said that he is confident the United States is capable of monitoring Iran and can strike militarily, if necessary. ""We have pretty good intelligence on them, we keep a close track on them,"" Panetta told CBS' ""This Morning"" in an interview aired on Tuesday. ""We think we've got the ability to be able to strike at them effectively if we have to ... whenever we have to, we have the forces in place,"" he said. The U.S. official, who spoke anonymously in order to freely discuss the sensitive issue, said Panetta is ""frustrated"" by the partial impact of sanctions, saying he has not seen ""the kind of response"" that would have been expected from the Iranian regime, given that the sanctions have been tightened. The United States has sanctioned Iranian banks, companies and individuals as part of an effort by western powers to pressure the Tehran government. Netanyahu also said sanctions were only having a partial impact. ""The sanctions have hurt the Iranian economy, but they haven't stopped the Iranian nuclear program. That's a fact,"" Netanyahu said on Tuesday at a news conference in Jerusalem.","Two leaders talk by phone about Iran nuclear program .
Earlier reports said White House rejected in-person meeting .
Obama administration says that is not the case ."
"A record number of people were deported from the United States last year, federal officials announced Tuesday. But does the Obama administration deserve all the credit -- or blame -- for this record?  And is it actually as impressive as it sounds? Critics say no to both questions, and charge the administration with creative accounting. President Barack Obama himself may have inadvertently added fuel to the fire. ""The statistics are actually a little deceptive,"" Obama said last month during a discussion with Hispanic journalists. There has been ""a much greater emphasis on criminals than non-criminals.""  And ""with stronger border enforcement, we've been apprehending folks at the borders and sending them back. That is counted as a deportation even though they may have only been held for a day or 48 hours."" Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, noted Obama's remarks Wednesday, saying he's ""frustrated about the administration's deceptive marketing tactics in claiming that they have deported more undocumented people than ever before."" The administration is ""playing a double game,"" argued Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors tighter immigration restrictions. ""They're telling (pro-immigration) advocacy groups that they're focusing on the worst of the worst"" by committing more resources to the most dangerous undocumented immigrants. ""But they're telling the broader public they've achieved record levels of deportations. It's a clever spin."" So what are the facts? Nearly 400,000 individuals were removed from the country in fiscal year 2011, which ended September 30, according to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. ICE Director John Morton trumpeted the news, calling it the result of ""smart and effective immigration enforcement"" that depends on ""setting clear priorities for removal and executing on those priorities."" The 396,906 figure is indeed a record -- but not by much.  A total of 392,862 people were deported in 2010 -- a difference of little more than 1%, according to ICE.  Almost 390,000 people were deported the year before that. Significantly larger increases in the total number of deportations occurred during George W. Bush's administration.  Fewer than 120,000 people were deported in 2001, when Bush took office. Analysts say much of the change over the last decade has been due to the implementation of controversial federal-led measures such as Secure Communities initiative and the Criminal Alien Program, which are designed to root out undocumented immigrants accused or convicted of various criminal acts.  Both measures predate Obama's presidency. Recent state-led crackdowns on illegal immigrants in places like Arizona -- despite all the media attention -- have played a less critical role, they insist. ""There certainly has been a tremendous uptick in state activity in the realm of immigration enforcement"" in recent years, said Greg Chen, director of advocacy at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  But ""in terms of what's driving enforcement, it's (still) really a federal-led issue."" Producing new deportation records -- however slim the margin -- appears to be a priority for the Obama White House.  Pundits argue the ability to tout such records could be political gold for a Democratic president wooing independent voters in 2012, though it does risk alienating Obama's liberal base. A Washington Post story from last December said administration ""officials quietly directed immigration officers to bypass backlogged immigration courts and time-consuming deportation hearings whenever possible"" in order to break the record for fiscal year 2010. ""Officials (also) told immigration officers to encourage eligible foreign nationals to accept a quick pass to their countries without a negative mark on their immigration record,""  the story concluded. Morton told the Post everything had been done ""on the merits"" and with ""no cooking of the books."" Under Obama, the budget for ICE's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations -- the money spent to identify, apprehend, detain and remove individuals from the country -- has actually remained relatively static, rising from $2.63 billion in fiscal year 2009 to $2.77 billion in fiscal year 2011. Immigration officials are currently funded ""to remove around 400,000 people based on the resources we're given by Congress,"" an ICE official told CNN.  What has changed most recently is ""the level of sophistication in finding folks who pose a public safety threat and are eligible for removal."" ICE stressed Tuesday that over half of the roughly 397,000 people deported last year had been convicted of felonies or misdemeanors.  That's an 89% increase in deported criminals from three years ago, the agency said.  And in August, the Department of Homeland Security announced its intention to individually review roughly 300,000 pending deportation cases in federal immigration courts. Lower priority cases -- those not involving individuals considered violent or otherwise dangerous -- will be suspended, the department said. Administration officials call it a matter of prioritizing cases and allocating scarce resources more efficiently.  Critics call it backdoor amnesty, a way to push through policy changes that conservatives in Congress would never agree to. If the administration is trying to walk a political tightrope, it may end up pleasing nobody.  Conservatives like Krikorian insist deportations would be increasing at a much faster rate if Obama pushed for more funding for ICE.  Progressive like Chen worry that undocumented immigrants who pose no threat to others are nevertheless at increased risk being rounded up by more aggressive ICE officials. ""This has all been part of the administration's strategy to advance reforms on immigration that include tough enforcement as well as providing a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country,"" Chen said.  ""But unfortunately that latter component has now fallen off.""","Adminstration officials say they deported a record number of people last year .

"(CNN)Boxing legend Muhammad Ali was released from a hospital Tuesday night after an 18-day stay for treatment of a urinary tract infection, a spokesman said Wednesday. Ali, 72, was admitted to an undisclosed hospital on December 20 for what spokesman Bob Gunnell  initially said was a mild case of pneumonia. The diagnosis later changed. ""After further observation and testing, doctors determined that Ali was suffering from a severe urinary tract infection, not pneumonia as originally diagnosed,"" Gunnell said Wednesday. ""The boxing legend has fully recovered and is now at his home."" He said Ali was looking forward to celebrating his 73rd birthday on January 17 with his family and friends. Born Cassius Clay, the fighter won an Olympic gold medal as a light-heavyweight at 18. In 1964, he became world heavyweight champion in an upset victory against Sonny Liston. Shortly thereafter, he changed his name to Muhammad Ali to reflect his conversion to Islam. The boxer was also known for his protest against the Vietnam War and refusal to be drafted into service out of religious conviction. He retired from boxing in 1981 and announced his diagnosis with Parkinson's disease three years later.

"(CNN)Searchers have found the tail section of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 in the murky depths of the Java Sea, raising hopes that the plane's black boxes and the precious information they hold might soon be recovered. The tail section, marked with part of the airline's logo, was detected by sonar early Wednesday, said Bambang Soelistyo, the head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency. Divers were sent to the location and plunged into the waves. Down on the sea floor, they were able to take pictures of the wreckage. Finding the tail section is a potentially vital step in the investigation because that is where the flight data and voice recorders -- the so-called black boxes -- are located in the Airbus A320-200, the aircraft model of Flight QZ8501. ""The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder are absolutely crucial to gaining an understanding of what happened to this aircraft,"" said Greg Waldron, the managing editor of Flightglobal, an aviation industry website. Are the black boxes there? But it's still uncertain if the black boxes are in the piece of wreckage the searchers discovered. ""I am led to believe the tail section has been found,"" tweeted AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes. ""If right part of tail section then the black box should be there."" That's assuming the flight recorders didn't come loose as the plane went down and hit the water. ""It's by no means certain that the recorders are located within the tail,"" Waldron said, noting that searchers haven't reported detecting any pings from the black boxes' locator beacons. ""They might have fallen free, which could create some issues,"" he said. Vital information . The recorders are generally considered the key piece of evidence when it comes to investigating a commercial plane disaster. The data recorder provides a wide range of valuable information about what the plane was doing, from its air speed to the position of the landing gear. The cockpit voice recorder captures communications between the pilots. In this case, officials hope it will contain any possible discussion of the crisis that eventually brought down the jet, Waldron said. Investigators will be looking for answers why Flight QZ8501 dropped off radar and went down December 28. The plane lost contact after the pilot requested permission to turn and climb to a higher altitude, according to Indonesian officials. Divers to keep looking . Soelistyo said Wednesday that divers were preparing to go back underwater in the same area, which is in one of the priority zones where search efforts have been focused. He didn't say at what depth the tail section had been found. ""Elements are also still conducive for another search. They also are striving to find the black box,"" Soelistyo told Indonesia's Channel tvOne. One of the images released by the search agency showed what appeared to be the letters A and X; another showed the word ""Air"" from the AirAsia logo. Searchers have been scouring the choppy waters of the Java Sea for remains from the commercial jet since it lost contact, with 162 people on board. It was flying from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore. Search teams had located several large pieces of wreckage believed to be from the plane but none of them as significant as the tail. Difficult conditions -- including thunderstorms, strong winds and big waves -- have hampered the search efforts, which are now in their 11th day. Soelistyo also said Wednesday that another body had been found in the sea, bringing the total to 40. Some of the bodies recovered previously have been discovered still strapped into seats. Many family members of the people on board the plane have been waiting in Surabaya for news of their loved ones. Of the 40 bodies discovered, 16 have been identified publicly. The vast majority of the people on the plane were Indonesian. There were also citizens of Britain, France, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea. The airline said Wednesday that it will offer family members roughly $100,000 in compensation per passenger. The amount is in addition to $24,000 offered to families to help with immediate financial hardship.

"In South Korea, the abduction and rape of a 7-year-old girl last week outraged the public and prompted  President Lee Myung-Bak to consider various measures including chemical castration to combat child sex crimes, according to local media. Chemical castration involves administering medication -- via injection or tablets -- to take away sexual interest and make it impossible for a person to perform sexual acts. The effects are reversible, after the person stops taking the drug. Lee said this week that all detering measures - including chemical castration - should be considered, according to the Korea Times. After high-profile child rape cases, politicians worldwide tend to pledge a crackdown and harsher punishments for sex offenders, involving chemical castration, said Don Grubin, professor of forensic psychiatry at Newcastle University. ""In a way, I liken it to cutting the hand off the thief,"" he said. ""It's very symbolic."" The use of chemical castration, while effective, remains controversial. While sex offenders may not be the most sympathetic group, critics say forced chemical castration violates human rights. The process of chemical castration has been used in various forms, either forcibly as a sentence or as a way for offenders to reduce their jail time in several countries including Argentina, Australia, Estonia, Israel, Moldova, New Zealand, Poland and Russia. At least nine U.S. states, including California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Oregon, Texas and Wisconsin have versions of chemical castration in their laws. It's unclear how frequently chemical castration is used in the United States. Earlier this year, Moldova legalized the practice for those convicted for child sex crimes. The practice of forced chemical castration has been called ""inhuman treatment"" by Amnesty International. The group released a statement after Moldova's legalization of the practice, stating that ""any crime shall be punished in a way that abides by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Clearly, in case of minors raped public opinion tilts towards harsher sentences. ""At first sight, forced chemical castration could be taken as a matter-of-course decision; however, it is incompatible with human rights, which are the foundation of any civilized democratic society,"" according to its March statement. In May, South Korea first used chemical castration on a sex offender who had been convicted of four counts of rape or attempted rape on young girls, according to the country's Ministry of Justice. A law authorizing this treatment for sex offenders came into effect last year after a public outcry over rapists reoffending following their release. The country could be poised to expand the use to punish those who sexually assault victims as old as 19. ""It's clear the drugs work,"" Grubin said.  ""If you look at men, they do reduce sex drive drastically. They do reduce re-offending in the men."" But they also have side effects, such as osteoporosis, changes in cardiovascular health, blood fat levels, blood pressure and symptoms that mimic women's menopause. The use is reasonable if the offender agrees to the medication to control their sexual drive, which some do, Grubin said. And it's ideal to receive the drugs along with psychological help, he added. It becomes problematic when it is used against a person's will for non-medical reasons, Grubin said. He wrote in a 2010 editorial in the British medical journal BMJ, ""Although castration is ostensibly for public protection, it also carries with it a sense of symbolic retribution."" Physical castration has also been used for sex offenders. In 2009, the Council of Europe's Anti-Torture Committee criticized the Czech Republic for its practice of surgically castrating convicted sex offenders. The committee described the practice as ""invasive, irreversible and mutilating."" Physical castration removes the testicles. This year, the same committee asked Germany to stop offering sex offenders the option of surgical castration. The procedure is not mandatory and remains very rare in Germany.","Chemical castration involves using drugs to take away sexual interest .
Mandatory chemical castration remains controversial .
South Korea could expand the practice after high profile child rape case ."
"In the photographs, retired FBI agent Bob Levinson stares straight at the camera and holds signs, his hands shackled. Reflecting a poor grasp of English, one note reads: ""WHY YOU CAN NOT HELP ME."" Another states: ""4th YEAR ... You Cant or you Dont want ...?"" On Tuesday, Levinson's family released the images, showing the former agent in an orange jumpsuit with long, unkempt hair. A family spokesman told CNN the photographs were received in April 2011. Asked why the family is releasing the images now, more than 18 months later, the spokesman said: ""The family is anxious that not enough is being done. There is frustration with the lack of progress on the case."" Wife of missing American pleads for help from Iran's president . ""We hope it will get things moving,"" the spokesman said. Levinson was last seen on Iran's Kish Island in March 2007. According to his family, Levinson was working as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling and disappeared during a business trip there. The family and the U.S. State Department have repeatedly denied he was working for the government and have urged Tehran to find him. ""I feel Iran needs to resolve this now. It's been six years,"" Christine Levinson, the missing man's wife, told CNN. She said her husband will likely miss another family milestone this year; their daughter is getting married in February.

I understand that he's being seen by a doctor three times a week and, if true, that's not good,"" she said, describing the photographs as disturbing. Levinson suffers from diabetes and appears to have lost 50 to 60 pounds since his capture. U.S. officials believe Levinson, now 64, is being held hostage somewhere in southwest Asia. While it's unclear who is holding him, a source with knowledge of the case said based on the evidence, there is every reason to believe that Levinson is alive and well. In 2010, Levinson's captors sent a ""proof of life"" videotape and photographs of him to his family. Those images were released to the public in 2011. The FBI has offered a $1 million reward for information leading to Levinson's safe return.

"U.S. Vice President Joe Biden will visit Japan and China this week as a dispute seethes over Beijing's recent claim of a large swath of airspace in the region. The Chinese declaration less than two weeks ago has prompted a war of words between governments and flights through the contested air zone by military planes from the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. The uneasy situation in the sky over the East China Sea has raised fears that a midair incident could cause circumstances to spiral out of control. It has also fueled concern about how far China is willing to go to pursue its interests in the Asia-Pacific region and push back against U.S. influence. ""Whatever Beijing's motives in declaring the zone, it will add to the growing international tide of suspicion and sometimes even outright hostility as China increasingly asserts its growing power,"" Andrew Hammond, a geopolitical analyst, wrote in a commentary for CNN.com this week. U.S. officials say that during his visit this week, Biden will raise American concerns about Beijing's newly declared air defense identification zone -- which the United States and Japan reject -- and encourage dialogue among countries in the region to ease tensions. He will also ""make the broader point that there is an emerging pattern of behavior by China that is unsettling to China's own neighbors,"" a senior Obama administration official said in a briefing last week. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki reiterated Monday that Washington doesn't recognize the air defense zone nor China's demand to be notified of plans by jets from other nations to fly into the area. Psaki said the U.S. position is separate from any U.S.-based airlines' decisions to comply with China's demands. Reassuring an ally . Biden will begin his Asia trip in Japan, the U.S. ally that is locked in the most direct confrontation with China and plans to beef up its military. Tokyo and Beijing's bitter dispute over a set of small, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea has already led to frequent tense encounters between the two sides' ships and planes over the past year. Now, China's new air defense zone overlaps significantly with that of Japan and encompasses the disputed islands. China is asking aircraft entering its air defense zone to identify themselves and submit flight plans. Japan has told its airlines not to comply with the new Chinese demands, but the U.S. government has urged American carriers to follow Beijing's instructions. After arriving in Tokyo late Monday, Biden is scheduled to meet Tuesday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is likely to want reassurances of American commitment to standing firm against China's air zone claims. The United States has thousands of troops stationed in Japan, and U.S. officials have reiterated that a mutual defense treaty between the two countries applies to the disputed islands, known as Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China. Biden will stress that ""the United States has a rock-solid commitment to our allies,"" a senior administration official said this week. He will also push for a reduction in tensions in the region, the official said. China flies fighter jet into disputed air defense zone; Japan remains defiant . A bolder China . But the American opposition to China's new air defense zone isn't simply a matter of supporting Japan and South Korea, another U.S. ally upset by the Chinese claim. U.S. officials say that China's zone impinges not only on existing zone's declared by Japan and South Korea, but also on international airspace that is regularly used by commercial carriers, civil aircraft and military planes. China argues, however, that it has the right to establish the air defense zone, just as Japan and South Korea were allowed to set up theirs in previous decades. It has also left open the possibility that it could declare more zones in the region, notably in the South China Sea where it's engaged in territorial disputes with the Philippines, Vietnam and others. After Japan, Biden will travel to Beijing, where he'll meet with several top Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping, who assumed power slightly over a year ago. Many analysts see Xi as the mastermind behind the new air defense zone declaration, identifying the move as part of an assertive new Chinese foreign policy aimed at testing U.S. resolve in the Western Pacific. China says it monitored U.S. B-52s that flew through its new air zone . U.S. officials have emphasized the importance of the personal relationships cultivated between top leaders in Beijing and Washington. The question is whether Biden's previous meetings with Xi will give him enough traction to defuse tensions over the East China Sea. In an editorial published Monday, the state-run newspaper China Daily predicted that the air defense zone could be ""a hard-to-navigate topic"" for Biden and British Prime Minister David Cameron, who is also visiting Beijing this week. The pivot to Asia . The final stop on Biden's tour will be in South Korea, another key American ally, where he will meet with President Park Geun-hye. China's new air defense identification zone partially encroaches on South Korea's existing zone, and has drawn criticism from Seoul. But other sensitive issues concerning the United States are also simmering on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea is holding two U.S. citizens prisoner, and Washington continues to press for their release. Beyond the immediate issues, Biden's visit aims to underscore American commitment to its broader foreign policy goal of focusing more on the Asia-Pacific region. That effort was undermined earlier this year when President Barack Obama canceled a visit to four Asian nations -- including two regional summits -- because of the U.S. government shutdown. ""The message is clear and simple: The United States is a resident Pacific power, we're here to stay, and we're actively engaged on the full spectrum of issues in the region,"" a senior administration official said last week. Massive naval power remains at heart of America's look eastwards .","State Department says U.S. military and government planes won't recognize zone .

"They first hit the man, thought to be a British soldier, with a car in broad daylight. Then the two attackers hacked him to death and dumped his body in the middle of a southeastern London road. As the victim -- dressed in what appeared to be a T-shirt for Help for Heroes, a charity that helps military veterans -- lay prone, one of the two attackers found a camera. ""We swear by almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone,"" said a meat-cleaver-wielding man with bloody hands, speaking in what seems to be a London accent.

At first James thought they were trying to help the man. But then he saw two meat cleavers, like a butcher would have.

""Remove your government. They don't care about you. You think David Cameron is going to get caught in the street when we start busting our guns? ""... Get rid of them. Tell them to bring our troops back so we can all live in peace."" The first call about an assault came in at 2:20 p.m. (9:20 a.m. ET). At some point afterward, police responded, including armed members of a firearms unit, even though British police typically don't carry guns. Metropolitan Police Commander Simon Letchworth noted that ""early reports"" indicated the attackers had ""weapons."" Metropolitan Police say they're aware of reports it took 30 minutes for police to arrive. The suspects rushed at the arriving officers before being shot, James told the radio station. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said the Metropolitan Police informed them at 2:50 p.m. of ""an incident,"" as would happen when police shoot and injure someone. Letchworth said both suspects were taken to separate London hospitals for treatment. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe later said the two had been arrested, though it wasn't immediately clear if this happened at the hospitals or elsewhere. ""We understand concern about the motivation, and we will work tirelessly to uncover why this occurred and and who was responsible,"" Hogan-Howe said, adding that his force's counterterrorism unit will lead the investigation. ""I understand people want answers, but I must stress we are in the early stages of investigations."" Centuries-old barracks part of London neighborhood . Cameron -- who was in France at the time of the incident but headed back home promptly -- declined to confirm if the man killed was a serving soldier, while Britain's Defense Ministry said it was investigating to see whether that's the case. Yet Nick Raynsford, a member of Parliament, told CNN that the victim is believed to be a serving soldier who was based at a nearby barracks. The soldier had apparently been on duty in central London and was returning to the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich when he was attacked, Raynsford said. The MP described Woolwich as a mixed, multicultural area, adding that troops stationed at the centuries-old military barracks there have a close relationship with locals. Even as they worked to piece together what happened and why, British authorities beefed up security around Woolwich and all military barracks in London, according to a British government source. And British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said the killing was a ""very shocking incident"" and that the United Kingdom takes the safety of its troops ""very seriously,"" as he headed into Wednesday night to a meeting of the country's civil emergency committee known as COBRA. The incident raised concerns it may inflame animosity against Muslims, with Metropolitan Police deploying riot police as a precautionary measure. The Muslim Council of Britain, after condemning what it called ""a truly barbaric act that has no basis in Islam,"" urged Muslims and non-Muslims alike ""to come together in solidarity to ensure the forces of hatred do not prevail."" Later Wednesday, a man with two knives threw a smoke grenade into a mosque in Essex, a county east of London, and demanded someone come outside to answer to the Woolwich slaying, the mosque's secretary said. The only person inside called police who came quickly and arrested the man, said Al Falah Braintree Islamic Center secretary Sikander Sleemy. ""I believe this was a revenge attack for what happened in Woolwich,"" Sleemy said. ""We strongly condemn what happened in Woolwich. It's not an Islamic act."" That attack had already spurred swift condemnations around the world and especially in Britain -- from a ""concerned"" Queen Elizabeth II, to London Mayor Boris Johnson's description of a ""sickening and unforgivable act of violence,"" to Labour Party leader Ed Miliband's prediction that the ""whole country will be horrified."" That's certainly true for Lauren Collins, who saw the gore up close. ""I still am quite shaken at what I've seen,"" she told CNN. ""I've seen a victim of an awful attack, and I've seen a body of a young man.""","A man thought to be a soldier is hit by a car then hacked to death, witnesses say .

"(CNN)On Mondays, the Denver Kush Club in Colorado runs a special on various strains of recreational marijuana. Customers can score an eighth of an ounce of premium weed for the same price they'd normally pay for a lower-grade, then take it home and use it, just for fun. On any given Monday in Texas, possessing an eighth of an ounce of any grade marijuana is a misdemeanor that can land you in prison for up to 180 days. It carries a fine of up to $2,000. Possessing more than 2 ounces means an even harsher punishment. The two states illustrate a nation divided by the legalization of marijuana. Last year, a CNN/ORC International survey found 55% of those polled supported legalization; 44% opposed it. On January 1, Colorado celebrated its first anniversary of legal recreational marijuana sales. Washington state has allowed the sale of recreational weed since June 1, 2014. Oregon and Alaska will join them in 2016. Voters in the nation's capital have also approved a recreational marijuana initiative, but the law is still pending congressional approval. Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have either legalized medical marijuana or decriminalized marijuana possession -- or both. Yet Texas is one of 23 states that still prohibits cannabis outright. How did we get here? In 1970, Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act, which listed marijuana as a Schedule I drug. Since then, it has been illegal to manufacture, distribute or possess marijuana in the United States, according to the federal government. However in August 2013, the U.S. Justice Department said it wouldn't challenge Colorado or other states with laws legalizing recreational marijuana. Instead, federal officials decided to focus on stopping drug trafficking and keeping marijuana away from children. In other words, states are effectively free to ignore the federal ban. So what happens if you're caught with marijuana varies on where you are. Private possession of up to 1 ounce carries no penalty in Colorado, and growing up to six marijuana plants (with no more than three being mature) at home is perfectly legal for someone 21 or older. Washington state permits adults to possess up to 1 ounce of cannabis, and/or up to 16 ounces of marijuana-infused solid products and 72 ounces of marijuana-infused liquid products for their own private, personal use. Using marijuana in public is still a civil violation and subject to a fine. Similar to Washington and Colorado, the Oregon and Alaska laws will also create a commercial regulatory system for the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. D.C.'s proposal, while more reserved than others, allows for people 21 or older to possess up to 2 ounces of marijuana for personal use and grow up to six cannabis plants in their home. Yet Congress has authority over the city's finances, so tucked into the recent spending bill is a provision that bars the District from using any of its own money or federal funds to regulate the use of pot. As previously mentioned, many states have decriminalized marijuana; it is still against federal law, but generally speaking, you won't get prison time or a criminal record on first offenses for carrying small amounts for personal use. You can still be hit with a civil fine, similar to a minor traffic violation. These relaxed laws have pro-marijuana legalization activists enthused. Many are already looking toward 2016, when ballot initiatives in California, Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada and Arizona other states are likely to be put to voters. Movement on the medical front . In August 2013, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta wrote an editorial, ""Why I changed my mind on weed."" In it, he detailed the reasons he believes marijuana should not be listed as a Schedule I drug. ""It doesn't have a high potential for abuse, and there are very legitimate medical applications,"" he wrote. Marijuana contains two main active ingredients: cannabidiol, or CBD, and tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. The touted health benefits of these ingredients range from pain relief to seizure control. While the Drug Enforcement Agency has not made a change in its classification, many medical organizations have called for restrictions on research to be loosened. We need to know, they seem to be collectively saying, whether cannabis is more helpful or harmful. Most recently, the American Academy of Neurology released a position paper (PDF) in support of ""efforts to conduct rigorous research to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of marijuana-based products."" ""Further research is needed to determine the benefits and safety of such products,"" the authors wrote. ""This is of paramount importance when marijuana-based products are used in patients with underlying neurologic disorders, or in children whose developing brains may be more vulnerable to the toxic effects of marijuana."" As restrictions loosen, the evidence for the legalization of medicinal marijuana is growing. A study published in August in JAMA Internal Medicine found that states that have legalized marijuana for managing chronic pain have significantly fewer deaths from prescription painkiller overdoses each year. Still, research on the long-term effects of marijuana use is limited. A study published in September in The Lancet showed teens who use marijuana daily before age 17 are more than 60% less likely to get their high school diploma than those who've never used pot. Daily adolescent users were 18 times more likely to become dependent on marijuana, seven times more likely to attempt suicide and eight times more likely to use other illegal drugs in the future. But is that because of their marijuana use? Or are other factors at play? Another study found that compared to nonusers, teens who smoked marijuana have less gray matter in their orbitofrontal cortexes -- the area of the brain that helps you make decisions. Researchers have also found that the reward center in the brains of 18 to 25 year olds who smoke marijuana at least once a week is different than the reward center in those who have no history of cannabis use. Yet some studies suggest the long-term effects may not be as damaging as this research suggests. A small study of 110 adults published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal found that while chronic marijuana users may have less gray matter, the connectivity channels in their brain are stronger, which could allow them to compensate, the study authors say. Many believe that as marijuana laws across the country continue to change, so too will the medical community's opinion.","Only four states have legalized recreational marijuana use .

"UPDATE Tuesday 4:30 pm ET: The NRA broke its recent silence Tuesday afternoon with a statement saying the group was ""shocked, saddened and heartbroken"" by the Newtown shootings and is prepared ""to help make sure this never happens again."" The gun lobby has scheduled a news conference for Friday. Despite an escalating nationwide debate on gun control in the wake of Friday's mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school, the National Rifle Association has remained conspicuously silent. As of Monday evening the largest and most powerful gun-rights lobbying group in the U.S. had not posted anything to its website since Friday morning, when a gunman entered Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton and killed 26 people, 20 of them children. The NRA's Facebook page has been deactivated, and visitors are redirected to a bare-bones page where comments are disabled (although ""Likes"" are still allowed). As of Tuesday morning Its Twitter account, which typically posts several times a day, had been quiet for four days. In a statement provided to CNN Friday about the shootings, NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said only, ""Until the facts are thoroughly known, NRA will not have any comment."" This social-media blackout after a mass shooting is not unprecedented for the NRA. The gun lobby didn't tweet for 10 days last July following the fatal shooting of 12 people in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater. However, an ill-timed tweet by ""American Rifleman,"" the official NRA journal, hours afterward said, ""Good morning, shooters. Happy Friday! Weekend plans?"" The NRA later said the tweeter was unaware of the tragedy. This time around, the NRA's silence comes amid widespread criticism of the group on social media and calls by some politicians for tougher gun-control laws. Two new polls conducted after Friday's shooting suggest Americans are becoming more supportive of gun-control measures. Bloomberg expands on his call for gun control action . So is the NRA's self-imposed silence a good idea? No, said Allyson Kapin, co-founder of Rad Campaign, a digital-strategy firm that works with nonprofits and political campaigns on social media policy. ""There is no social media handbook I know that says, 'Don't respond in a crisis, bury your head in the sand,' "" she said. ""You need to be prepared to respond even if you aren't prepared to make a statement. There are still people out there on the fence about the NRA, and this was an opportunity to engage and start a conversation. They didn't even have to take a political stance, but they could have at least taken a human one and reacted. Instead they said nothing."" Lawmakers seem prepared to tackle gun control . The NRA did not return messages seeking comment on Monday. A representative for Facebook told CNN they were not able to speak for the NRA and do not comment on organization's actions on their own pages. The gun-rights lobby is typically aggressive in defending Second Amendment freedoms. Less than 24 hours after NBC's Bob Costas advocated for stricter gun-control laws during a broadcast of a football game December 2, the NRA took to Twitter, citing a Daily Caller Column to say Costas ""offended millions of law-abiding gun-owning football fans w his gun-ban rant & owes us an apology."" That same day, the head of the NRA told CNN he expects an ""unprecedented"" attack on Second Amendment rights in the new Congress. ""I think it is going to come hard, I think it is going to come fast, and I think it is going to come soon,"" Wayne LaPierre, NRA's executive vice president and chief executive officer, said in an interview. ""We are going to stand and fight,"" he said. ""We are prepared to do what we have always done. Our strength isn't the (NRA) building, it is not money. ... Our strength is the individual people all over the country who value their ability to own a gun.""

"In an extraordinary display of civil disobedience, women in Saudi Arabia on Saturday defied their nation's de facto ban on women driving by getting behind the steering wheel. After a campaign for change gathered pace on social media, numerous women filmed themselves behind the wheel Saturday in various cities and uploaded those videos to YouTube. Several Saudi supporters of the October 26th Women's Driving Campaign told CNN that at least 25 women drove Saturday. Authorities stopped five women who were spotted driving in the Saudi capital and ""each case was dealt with accordingly,"" Col. Fawaz Al-Meeman of Riyadh police told CNN. Al-Meeman, an assistant spokesman for that city's police department, explained that the women weren't taken to police stations. Instead, they were kept in their vehicles until their male guardians arrived, at which point the women were released after signing pledges not to drive again. Driving campaign supporter Mai Al-Swayan, an economic researcher, said she was one of the women who drove Saturday. She posted a video on YouTube showing her driving. She said she drove from home to a grocery store in Riyadh, and then back with her groceries. ""I drove on the highway and was noticed by a couple of cars but they were fine with it,"" she said. Opinion: Give Saudi women right to drive . ""I'm very proud. I feel like we accomplished the purpose of our campaign."" Al-Swayan, who has taken the wheel before in defiance of the ban, said she was worried about what might happen before she drove Saturday but now plans to keep doing it. She said she believed more women would drive in the days to come. Photographer: Taken to police station . While Riyadh police said no one was taken to police stations, that wasn't the case in Jeddah, said photographer Samia El-Moslimany. She said she was detained in the evening for having driven and taken to a police station, where there was another woman who had been stopped for driving. El-Moslimany said she was later released. ""I thought I was going to take an uneventful drive around the neighborhood to solidify my reasoning that it's not against the law, simply against the current customs of our country,"" El-Moslimany told CNN. Men she believes to be police informants spotted and followed her, she said. She pulled over and called her driver to take her back home, but police appeared and she had to go to the station. ""We were treated with respect and treated so professionally,"" El-Moslimany said. ""We described how we were not part of any demonstration, that we ... felt it was our right. They spoke to us very kindly and said we'd have to sign a pledge not to drive again."" Police told the women they needed their guardians to come to the station before they could be released, she said. Jeddah police could not be immediately reached for comment. Interior Ministry: Laws will be enforced . Asked if any women were observed or stopped from driving, or if there was an increased police presence on the streets of major cities, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry spokesman Mansour Al-Turki said it was a ""normal day, just like every Saturday."" He added, ""I am not aware of any violation. Usually regional police spokesmen would speak to media about any, if any violation takes place."" Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry issued a warning earlier in the week to women caught driving and anyone taking part in demonstrations. Without outlining how laws would be applied and what punishment might be doled out to offenders, Al-Turki said then, ""All violations will be dealt with -- whether demonstrations or women driving."" He added, ""Not just on the 26th. Before and after. At all times."" No traffic law specifically prohibits women from driving in Saudi Arabia, but religious edicts there are often interpreted to mean women are not allowed to operate a vehicle. It's not clear what action might be taken against women who defy the de facto ban. Several Saudi women supporting the campaign said they received threatening calls Thursday from men claiming to represent the Interior Ministry, according to women's rights activists who requested anonymity. The callers warned the women not to drive before, on or after Saturday, the activists said. Initially, Al-Turki denied any calls were made. He later contacted CNN to clarify his comments, saying the phone calls were a public relations move by the ministry to help people understand that laws would be ""fully enforced"" Saturday. 'Shameful' to detain women for driving . Adam Coogle, a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch, told CNN via e-mail that the Saudi Interior Ministry was trying to ""deflate the momentum"" behind the campaign through ""direct, individual intimidation."" He called on Saudi Arabia to end discrimination and allow women to go about their business. ""It is shameful that a woman could be detained for activity that isn't illegal,"" he said. ""The Interior Ministry claims it is against 'activities that disturb public peace,' but pulling over and arresting activists merely for practicing their rights is a far greater threat to public peace than merely getting behind the wheel."" One of those spearheading the driving campaign is activist Manal Al-Sharif, who was jailed for more than a week in 2011 after posting a video of herself driving. Al-Sharif, who now lives in the United Arab Emirates, said it is a positive sign that the government stated its position on women driving. ""They kept telling the world that the women's driving issue was one for Saudi society to decide upon,"" she said. ""Society is now showing it is supportive of the idea of women driving. The government's reaction makes it very clear this is not a societal decision. This is a political decision."" Saturday's protest was the culmination of an online movement launched in late September urging Saudi women to get behind the wheel. The campaign quickly gained momentum, with its online petition garnering more than 16,000 signatures despite the kingdom's restrictions on protests. The online initiative was boosted by the fact that residents of Saudi Arabia are highly active on social media and YouTube. Rights group Amnesty International on Thursday urged Saudi Arabia to allow women to drive and not punish those campaigning for change. The group said at least 35 women drove on Saudi streets Saturday, filming and uploading their videos on to YouTube. Cleric warns driving could damage women's ovaries .

"As ""The Walking Dead""  approaches its fall finale on Sunday, fans have two big questions on their minds. First, they have been waiting weeks to see how Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) will react to the news that his closest friend Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) has been banished from the prison where the survivors have holed up. Next, they want to know how the Governor's (David Morrissey) apparent coming attack on the prison (with a tank, no less) will affect the survivors, especially Daryl, who has not had any big scenes for the better part of a month. After all, Daryl-inspired GIFs and fan art abound online, and Reedus fans' perfect-for-a-T-shirt battle cry is ""If Daryl Dies, We Riot."" So watch out, Gov. Reedus barely appeared in the first season of the show, but by season two, the legions of zombie fans were infected with Daryl mania. Officially the coolest customer in the apocalypse, the crossbow-wielding Daryl takes out ""walkers"" with arrows, earning more fans every time. It seems that surviving just becomes him. Zombie fans ravenous for more at 'Walking Dead' convention with Lincoln, Reedus . This season has been a tough one for Daryl, having felt betrayed by Bob, and of course, the aforementioned banishment of Carol. (And that's after losing brother Merle last season.) CNN spoke to Reedus about what makes Daryl, and the actor behind him, tick. CNN: When did you first realize that this character had a special following all his own? Reedus: I started recognizing it gradually from the beginning. I got a lot of girl love after that ""Cherokee Rose"" speech (in Season 2). I don't know, I guess it keeps growing gradually. When you're shooting, you don't know what's going on because you're in Georgia, and you're shooting. Then you go somewhere like a Comic-Con and it's, ""Holy moley, that's a lot of people."" Now I get a lot of love everywhere I go. So I guess it's a gradual thing. CNN: Daryl fits right in in the apocalypse in rural Georgia. How do you like filming there? Reedus: I love it there. We shoot down in Senoia, Georgia. I like even further south than Atlanta. I'm a huge Georgia fan. I ride my motorcycle just about every day, and I drive through the country, the back roads, where there's no cars, just cows and trees and grass. I love it, it's heaven on Earth down there. CNN: Daryl's importance on the show has grown over the seasons. How has he evolved? Reedus: In the first season, everything came out of the side of Daryl's face. He didn't really look you in the eyes. He kept moving; he was walking behind everybody and couldn't sit still and he was so uncomfortable. Now he looks you directly in the face, and he can stand perfectly still. I don't think he was proud of who he was. He was set in his ways, and he was doomed to this life and didn't really know it. He's got this reverse thing than the rest of the members of the group have. He can fend for himself, he can hunt and make it on his own. I've gotta find the glue that keeps him with all these people. He's starting to make connections with people for the first time. The relationships he's forming with these people and this feeling that people need him. I think he feels good about it. He hates what's going on and people can die any second, but at the same time, he's finding things out about himself. CNN: Do you stick around to watch scenes you're not in? Reedus: When Lori died, the whole cast was there to watch it happen, same with T-Dog. We watch each other and support each other, especially in the big scenes. I don't find out things I don't need to know about, other than just supporting people. CNN: Last season, Daryl briefly reunited with his brother Merle. What was that like to play out? Reedus: There's this interesting thing when we did that arena scene. The Governor brings me in there and rips that hood off. Then I see Merle and I actually back into the Governor. It's not just like you're seeing a ghost, but it's almost like you stepped into your comfort zone and liked it. But then you're back in that reality where you're used to being the one under the thumb, the one kicked around. It's not written the way we do it. The nuances are the actors' nuances. We could have all gone in there and said the same words and been like caged wolverines. You could have played it that way, but you play it how you feel it and you talk with the writers and directors. You collaborate and make it different for a reason. I wanted to go into that playing it as small as possible. The more I whimper, the more he looks at me like ""This is my fault, what have I done?"" It's more than just ""oh my God, shock, it's you!"" You have to play the sympathy and ties that keep those people interested and thinking of each other. The smaller I play it, the more big brother he is. That sad, desperate thing makes it more interesting than ""We'll kill everybody in this room!"" You have to be tough and scared the same time. I tried to play that dude like he's always had to fight and his back's always against the wall. CNN: Any particularly favorite scenes over the years? Reedus: There's the one where Daryl is walking behind Rick, and getting baby formula for ""Lil' Asskicker,"" and he says, ""I want to thank you for what you've done,"" and he says, ""It's what we do."" That's one. There's the one with Carol in the trailer when he hands her the rose and does the ""Cherokee Rose"" speech. That came out of nowhere. I don't think he really realized what was going on. There's one where he's walking away from Rick, and says he's better off on his own. When Merle pulls the shirt off and sees all the scars, that next five minutes is another one. Everything you say and do is important, so nobody really wastes time. You can take every scene you've done and they're all different facets of his character. CNN: Were you originally interested in the fact that this is a zombie show? Reedus: I kind of got late to pilot season, and I never really thought about doing a TV show before, I was doing movies. I read all these pilots, and they were doctor drama, buddy roommate drama, lawyer drama and they were so similar and this one just stuck out. I read it, and I didn't even see zombies in it, to be honest. The characters are what drew me into it. Then I saw who was attached to it, and it was Frank Darabont and Gale Anne Hurd and AMC. And I was only really watching AMC shows. It just had all these elements that were too good. I didn't see zombie show or monster show, I just saw top quality A-list people and a script that was far better than all the other ones. I love that Andrew (Lincoln's) character (Rick Grimes) is always making mistakes. If he just solved things, it would be boring. Frank gave him this note that he's up on this tank and there's all these zombies around and he finally gets out and jumps off the tank to run away, and twists his ankle. Frank told him, that's your character. That's so interesting. CNN: What about the possibility of romance between Carol and Daryl? Reedus: I like that Carol and Daryl recognize in each other that they're damaged. It's better than ""Cue the music, let's make out."" CNN: Now that you have a few years under your belt, what scares you now? Anything but zombies? Reedus: Disease scares me, death scares me. The way Greg Nicotero does those zombies, you see the dying, scared lost sad person behind the monster. That's what makes the monster scary.","Norman Reedus has become a breakout star on TV's No. 1 show, ""The Walking Dead""

"The United States will defend against efforts to remove a giant cross atop a war memorial in Southern California over claims it violates the constitutional separation of church and state, according to a petition filed this week with the U.S. Supreme Court. It's the latest legal salvo in the decades-long battle over the cross on the memorial at Mount Soledad in San Diego. The legal battle has pitted veterans and caretakers of the memorial against the city and those who say it violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The court filing by the Department of Justice on Wednesday comes after the Mount Soledad Memorial Association petitioned the Supreme Court to settle, once and for all, the constitutional question about the cross. ""...The United States remains fully committed to preserving the Mount Soledad cross as an appropriate memorial to our nation's veterans,"" the Justice Department petition said. Long legal battle . The legal wrangling follows a ruling by a U.S. district judge in December that ordered the cross be taken down from the memorial. But the judge stayed his ruling while the case was appealed. In the petition filed this week, lawyers for the Obama administration warned if the district court reinstated the order that the cross be removed, they would take the issue to the highest court in the nation. The cross was erected in 1954 in honor of Korean War veterans and has been the subject of near constant judicial back-and-forth since 1989, when two Vietnam War veterans filed suit saying it violated the California Constitution's ""No Preference"" clause. Since that first lawsuit, the city of San Diego twice tried selling the property beneath the cross to the Mount Soledad Memorial Association, only to be stopped by the courts. In 2004, the parties involved reached an agreement that would have moved the cross to a nearby church, but two congressmen intervened and inserted a rider into the 2005 omnibus budget bill that designated the property a national veterans' memorial and authorized the federal government to accept the donation of the property. This led to more fights and more court filings. Congress intervenes . The fight became so contentious that Congress attempted in 2006 to solve the problem by taking control of the land and designating it a national memorial. Three congressmen pushed through a bill calling for the government to seize the property by eminent domain -- calling it ""a historically significant war memorial."" The federal government took possession in August of that year. But that was followed by more lawsuits, including one filed by Vietnam veterans Steve Trunk and now-deceased Philip K. Paulson and another filed by the ACLU on behalf of the Jewish War Veterans of the United States. The suits sought to stop the transfer of property to the government, saying the Christian cross atop the memorial violated the Establishment Clause that prohibits the government from taking a position on one religion over another. The district court has since consolidated the cases.","The Obama administration says it will fight attempts to remove a cross from a war memorial .

"It occurred to me for the first time as I sat in the car's front seat and felt my father's cold corpse in the back seat in May 2007. The nurses at the Ikorodu General Hospital had just said no to his body. He had died from heart failure an hour or two before. They needed a police report. I could hardly believe the utter coldness of it. But I had yet to see -- or hear -- the worst. Because I am born and bred in Nigeria, I knew that, at 11pm, the body of my dear father might rot if I sat there pondering the inanity of the request or stood up to argue its inhumanity, so I led the convoy to the nearest police station. Opinion: Why Nigerians are no longer content with 'suffering and smiling' There, with the most pointed lack of compassion I had ever witnessed up onto that point, the police proceeded to haggle with themselves over how much they would extract from a 24-year-old who had just lost his father -- a father whose dead body was only a few meters away. As they dropped my father's body in that unkempt, abominable mortuary (one in which I had to tip the caretaker daily on my way to work so that the corpse would not be left to decompose), I could only think of what an abominable country I was so unfortunate to come from, and to live in. I recalled that scene as I came across pictures of rotten corpses stacked on each other in a room -- victims of June's Dana Crash;  ""rotting carcasses of human beings stacked on each other, fluids mingling."" More: Nigerians demand answers in wake of Dana Air crash . That is when it hit me. We are living like animals in this country. I remember my father -- and how he, and I, were treated so terribly because our country does not care for any one. These Dana Crash dead bodies weren't victims of a serial killer locked in a room for months or of a brutal civil war with shut-down health-care services -- these were citizens of a country, who had just been visited by their president a day before, nonetheless treated in death with relentless disrespect. They had been killed by their country -- and it couldn't even pack their bodies well. More: Is a 'Nigerian Spring' next? It could have been you, or me. It's not just that it could have been me. That's not the worst part. This is the worst part: I could have been the one in that flight waiting for 20 minutes after a fatal crash; sitting there in mind-numbing agony, knowing the plane would soon explode and kill me because I live in a country where emergency services would arrive only about an hour after, and people will die who could have been saved. That's the part that gets me. And as I watched officials scramble to protect their irrelevant jobs so that they could make enough money to buy First Class tickets on airlines that might crash and kill their children tomorrow, I realized how hopeless we had become as Nigerians. So I ask myself; why are we still in Nigeria -- a country that does not deserve many of us -- even when we have a choice? Why are we not like the generation that left town? Why are we living in a country that cannot protect us, has not supported us, will not satisfy us? More: Nigeria's oil economics fuel deadly protests . The logical thing to do is to leave fastest way we can; once the opportunity turns up. But we stay and we come back, because we go better, because it is well, because God dey; because somehow, somehow we think we can survive it; maybe even improve it . But let's tell ourselves the truth -- many of you in this hall have already given up on Nigeria. Many of us are convinced that this ship is sinking, this country cannot change. We do not trust our politicians, but that is even cliché. We do not trust the activists. Everyone is seen as searching for a piece of that national cake. That's what we have become as a country: an unending race for a part of that cake. It is difficult to have faith in this kind of country; difficult to tell yourself with a straight face that you are proud of being a Nigerian. It is difficult to have faith even when you look at the young people -- scrambling for crumbs off the table, buffeted by the need to avoid the poverty of their fathers, changing principle on whim just like those before them; perpetuating scams in the name of advocacy, running businesses long on hype and short on substance. It is difficult to have faith in that kind of country. It is herculean to believe in it. It is almost impossible to be proud of it. More: Nigeria on edge as Islamist group extends campaign of violence . No, Nigeria, is not a great country. It wasn't great yesterday, it isn't great today. It can be great, it should be great, it could have been great, and if we sit down and get serious, it will be great. After the Dana Crash, I gave up hope in this country; I lost my faith, I struggled with my love. But two day later, I was back working for the country, and that is the real story. In pictures: Putting a face on Nigeria's ""paradise lost"" It is okay to fall out of love, it is okay to hate that love every once in a while, it is okay to condemn, to criticise, to react, to fight, to protest, to demand; but you must return to loving it, you must return to being pained. It is the reason despite Governor Amaechi spending two hours debating fiercely with us that our generation is only interested in continuing the ""chopping"", he decided that it is crucial to get the brightest of that generation here to inspire the young people in Rivers State and across Nigeria -- moving it from an idea in 2006 that couldn't even pay for the hall in which it held, to a movement in 2012 that has taken over this Port Harcourt. It's because beneath a tough-talking governor lies a tender spot for his country and its future -- and I see it daily across this country even from the lips of those who curse it. Even in those who appear to be ripping the country to shreds, every once in a while you see that wistfulness for what might have been. More: Goodluck Jonathan: Nigeria's embattled president . But, this is the good news, it is not too late. I do not come as a prophet of cliché, I come here as a student of history because other countries have done it. This shipping is sinking, but it hasn't yet sunk. As long as we are in Nigeria, as long as Nigerians live in Nigeria and work in Nigeria, and fight for Nigeria, and refuse to give up on Nigeria, there is hope. We cannot ever lose that pain that we should feel for a country that continues to fail us. No matter how disappointed we are in our country, we cannot abandon it. We cannot use Nigeria as an excuse to fail Nigeria. Pehaps we should handle Nigeria the way a mother handles a drug-addicted child -- with tough love sometimes, with deliberate gentility at other times; demanding at one time, encouraging at the other. Listen guys, we are all we've got, and this should be the turning point generation. See more from the the Future Project Nigeria . I don't come here to excite you; I come here so we can encourage one another. I come here to remind us that, after all said and done, you and I are still here. And 'cause we are still here, we have no choice but to keep working. Let's keep the faith. If we stumble, let's rise. When we fall, let's rebound. Let's refuse to let Nigeria go, let's insist that it must work. Let's keep working until it changes; let's keep changing until we tear down these walls. Because we can. Because we have no choice. Because we love this land. God bless Nigeria.","Chude Jideonwo says Nigerians need to fight for Nigeria, and refuse to give up on Nigeria.

"(CNN)Bill Cosby's TV wife is standing firmly in his corner -- even as three more women made accusations against the comedian. Showbiz 411 reported that Phylicia Rashad, who played Clair Huxtable on NBC's ""The Cosby Show,"" told the outlet that she never saw any indication of the behavior that many women have attributed to the legendary actor. He has been accused of harassing, drugging and sexually assaulting multiple women. No charges have ever been filed against Cosby, and his attorneys have vehemently denied the allegations. ""Forget these women,"" Rashad said. ""What you're seeing is the destruction of a legacy. And I think it's orchestrated. I don't know why or who's doing it, but it's the legacy. And it's a legacy that is so important to the culture."" More than 20 women have come forward with claims, and a defamation lawsuit has been filed against Cosby. The long-admired actor and comedian has seen his reputation suffer in the wake of the allegations, including the cancellation of a planned television show and the suspension of the Cosby Chair for the Humanities at Spelman College in Atlanta, where he and his wife, Camille, have been longtime benefactors. Three more accusers . On Wednesday, attorney Gloria Allred brought out three more women -- Linda Kirkpatrick, Lynn Neal and a woman who chose to be identified only as Kacey -- who say they were sexually assaulted by the comedian after being drugged by him. Kirkpatrick, who met Cosby at a tennis tournament, and Neal, who was a health club massage therapist, said their incidents happened in the early 1980s. Kacey, a former employee of the William Morris Agency who was an assistant to a Cosby agent, dated her incident to the 1990s. While introducing the women, Allred -- who challenged Cosby last month to meet his accusers in court or set aside $100 million to settle their claims -- addressed Rashad's statements. ""Phylicia, you should be supporting these women rather than joining Cosby's paid 'attack dogs' who are trying to undermine them in any way that they can,"" Allred said. She added that Cosby's camp has not accepted either of the offers she made in December. Rashad: 'Someone is determined' Rashad, who also starred as the actor's wife on the CBS show ""Cosby,"" said she sees the controversy as part of a larger plot. ""Someone is determined to keep Bill Cosby off TV,"" she said. ""And it's worked. All his contracts have been canceled."" The actress said she loves Cosby and defended his wife, saying there was no way Camille Cosby would stand for such behavior from her husband of 50 years. ""This is a tough woman, a smart woman,"" Showbiz 411's Roger Friedman writes that Rashad told him. ""She's no pushover."" She also spoke on the legacy of the beloved show that cemented her and Cosby as one of TV's favorite couples. ""This show represented America to the outside world,"" she said. ""This was the American family. And now you're seeing it being destroyed. Why?"" Asked why she believed Cosby hasn't spoken up to defend himself other than to say that the black media should cover the story with a ""neutral mind,"" Rashad said she believes he has too much pride to do it. ""If he spoke now, what do you think the media would do with it?"" she said.","NEW: Three more women make allegations about Bill Cosby .

"Why do their cheap meatballs taste so good? Why are bookshelves named Billy? Why can't store layouts be normal? These questions, and more, will no doubt be posed by the visitors who head to the new IKEA Museum opening next year. Of course, we might need to hammer together our own answers, having wound our way through thousands of irrelevant facts first. But perhaps a DIY museum experience will be even more satisfying once completed. The furniture company that changed the affordability of design has filed to build a museum on the site of its first store in Sweden. Tentatively scheduled to open in fall 2015, the museum will take up 7,000 square meters on the site of the recently relocated IKEA store in Almhult, also the site of IKEA'S first store opened by founder Ingvar Kamprad in 1958. IKEA town . Almhult is known as ""IKEA Town"" for being the birthplace of IKEA, which still maintains a strong corporate presence in the city. While the then-17-year-old Kamprad had already registered IKEA as a business in 1943, selling products ranging from nylon stockings to cigarette lighters, the Almhult site was the first brick-and-mortar store as well as the company's first furniture showroom.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- What a difference a few city blocks can make. Crowds of thousands upon thousands of Egyptians demonstrated peacefully Friday, filling most of Cairo's sprawling and once besieged Tahrir Square. They played music on loud speakers, danced and chanted ""down with the dictator"" in a rally dubbed ""Day of Departure."" But down the side streets leading east from Tahrir Square, just a few hundred meters away, fierce clashes raged between gangs of pro- and anti-regime youths. After hours of skirmishes, the rebels had advanced east, erecting barricades and checkpoints around the imposing 19th century stone buildings that line the roundabout in Talaat Harb Square. By 7 p.m., the opposition activists had also seized streets running several blocks deeper into the city from Talaat Harb. Several ambulances stood parked in Talaat Harb, their blue lights flashing as medics treated wounded men inside. A 20-minute walk down the streets of newly captured opposition territory showed streets littered with rocks and paving stones, which have been the primary weapons used during three days of urban fighting. Young men raced back from the clash points, carrying wounded comrades who howled in pain. They carried one young man dressed in a preppy button-down shirt and sweater into a makeshift first aid station in a storefront at one of the entrances to Tahrir Square. ""A group of 50 of them surrounded me and beat me,"" the man yelled. He bit down furiously on a notebook and sweated profusely as medics took off his shoe, revealing what appeared to be a badly broken foot. Moments later, bystanders applauded when the man waved a victory sign as he was carried away. An Egyptian army soldier stood in the corner of the room, keeping a close eye on a bruised and bloodied shoeless man who sat in a corner. He was a prisoner who appeared to have been severely beaten after being captured by demonstrators. When the soldier motioned for the man to follow him out of the first aid station, the captive cried and begged not to be led out into Tahrir Square. Throughout the day, several captives have been similarly escorted by Egyptian troops deployed in Tahrir Square to a military-controlled alley behind Cairo's Egyptian Museum. The soldiers protected these prisoners from angry protesters, who cursed and tried to beat them as they were led through the square. At one point, activists sounded the alarm, calling for 10 volunteers to rush to the front lines past Talaat Harb Square. Young men began beating metal poles against metal barricades and whistling as teenagers wearing helmets made from cardboard boxes and carrying stones raced toward the latest street battle.","Battles break out offstage on Egypt's ""Day of Departure""

"(CNN) -- Standing outside a courthouse Sunday that the Libyan opposition is using for a base of operations in the town of Misrata, a witness described a sense of jubilation against a backdrop of blood stains and rocket fragments. ""I'm standing in the middle of a ... battlefield,"" the witness told CNN by phone from Misrata after a fierce fight between rebels and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces. People were holding their hands up, singing, chanting and cheering, he said. ""Everyone is hugging everyone."" CNN is not identifying witnesses and sources for safety reasons. Videos posted on YouTube and thought to be out of Misrata showed damage to buildings and several shots of people celebrating around the opposition flag -- once being raised on a pole, and another time being waved by a man atop a charred vehicle that had a dead body inside. A doctor at Central Misrata Hospital said 42 people were killed in the fighting -- 17 from the opposition and 25 from the pro-Gadhafi forces. Among the dead was a 3-year-old child, killed from direct fire, the doctor said. At least 85 people were wounded, the doctor said. The fighting continued on the city's outskirts Sunday evening. The witness described the opposition's victory in central Misrata even as people some 200 kilometers (125 miles) west, at a pro-Gadhafi demonstration in Tripoli, insisted the government had taken back the coastal central Libyan city. After reports of the opposition successfully holding onto Misrata, east of Tripoli, Libyan state TV showed a graphic stating that ""strict orders have been issued to the armed forces not to enter cities taken by terrorist gangs."" On Sunday morning, pro-Gadhafi militias converged on Misrata from three different points, trying to retake control of the city, the witness said. He saw four tanks, though other witnesses told him there were a total of six. Using heavy artillery, the ground forces and tanks headed for the courthouse operations base. Tanks fired rockets at the building, and black smoke could be seen rising from it, he said. The opposition couldn't match the government's weaponry, but rebels took to the streets using what weapons they had, such as machine guns. And some simply picked up whatever they could find, with some resorting to sticks, he said. Speaking to CNN during the battle, he said, ""People are willing to die for the cause,"" describing them as ""fearless"" and ""amazing."" Later, after the forces had been repelled from the city center, the witness said, ""I can't believe it. ""The will and the determination and dedication that people are showing here on the ground, it just makes you speechless,"" he said. Describing the scene, he said, ""We're talking about a rocket on the ground. We're talking about blood everywhere."" CNN could not confirm witness reports for many areas in Libya, including Misrata. Valerie Amos, the United Nations' Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, said Sunday that there was ""urgent"" need for humanitarian aid in Misrata because ""people are dying and need help immediately."" The world body has gotten reports that Libyan Red Crescent ambulances dispatched from Tripoli have been trying to get into Misrata to transport out dead and injured people. ""I call on the authorities to provide access without delay to allow aid workers to help save lives,"" Amos said in a statement.","NEW: Videos online show damage to buildings and waving of the opposition's flag .

"To friends and relatives of the suspect in the Tuesday killing of a high school math teacher in Danvers, Massachusetts, the arrest of the teen they know is as shocking as the crime itself. Before he moved to Massachusetts last spring, Philip Chism had impressed the people he knew in Clarksville, Tennessee, where he graduated last spring from Rossview Middle School. ""Great soccer player -- probably the main reason we won the league championship last year,"" Jando Herrera told CNN affiliate WZTV about Chism, whom he coached in soccer for two seasons. ""I'm sure any of his teammates would say the same thing: that he was just the nicest kid on the team, probably. ... It's completely out of character; it's not something that I would ever imagine Philip ever, you know, doing or anything like that ... always the most respectful kid that I've, you know, had around -- 'yes sir, no sir.' "" After graduating from middle school, Chism moved from Tennessee to Danvers, where he appeared to provoke little concern among his classmates or others in the town of 26,000 people in a suburb north of Boston. Nicole White said she never heard her classmate in history class at Danvers High School discuss their math teacher, 24-year-old Colleen Ritzer. ""He never talked about her,"" she said. ""Nothing ever happened. So it came to a shock to all of us, I think."" White said she saw nothing out of place during her collaboration with Chism on a history assignment. ""He was always a really, really quiet kid, but he was nice,"" she told CNN. ""I saw no problems at all."" ""He's quiet, just kept to himself -- probably because he's new to the society but, I mean, he's a good kid,"" said Kyle Cahill, a junior at the school. A member of Chism's English class, Ariana Edwards, said Chism had friends, but chose them carefully. ""He wasn't, like, too friendly though,"" she said. ""He, like, only had certain friends. He wasn't, like, outgoing to everyone ... in classes he would only talk to, like, a select few people. And he was new too, so, like, he didn't have, like, the, like, amount of friends as everyone else."" Still, she said, he ""seemed quiet and reserved, but he just seemed normal."" Chism didn't drink or do drugs, and he came from a good family, one of his friends said. He described Chism as a good athlete who was shy at first but eventually warmed up to people, adding that he hadn't been acting strangely lately. Teacher slayings hurt view of schools as safe havens . This friend and others got their first hint that something had gone awry on Tuesday, when Chism didn't show up for soccer practice. The team searched for him after seeing texts that he was missing. ""We didn't know whether he was like kidnapped or if he was hurt somewhere, so we went around looking for him because we cared about him,"" said a teammate. ""Obviously, he was on the team and we liked him."" As they and police were looking for him -- and after Ritzer was killed -- Chism went to the movies, a source with knowledge of the investigation said. A few hours later, the lanky young man with closely cut hair was charged with murder. Chism's uncle, who still lives in Clarksville, told CNN affiliate WKRN in Nashville that something may have provoked his nephew. ""Might could have been upset,"" Terrence Chism Blaine said Wednesday. ""You know -- teenagers go through that. He's 14, he's growing up still. That's the only thing that I can imagine. I can't imagine anything else because he's like a storybook kid -- a perfect family."" In a telephone interview with CNN, Blaine said the boy's parents are separated and that the father -- a former military man -- now lives in Florida. Asked if the suspect had had behavioral issues, he said, ""No, I don't believe so."" ""I think it's insane,"" classmate Andre Poland told CNN affiliate WCVB in Boston. ""I'm completely shocked. I don't think Philip would be the type of person to do this."" Classmate Riley Doyle said she was searching for answers. ""I just want to know why anyone would do that -- especially to someone who's such a nice and kind and good-hearted person,"" she told CNN. ""It doesn't make any sense. Just why?"" Herrera said he was reserving judgment about the former player on his soccer team. ""I want to see what else there is, you know,"" he said. ""I want the whole story to kind of come out before people really cast a lot of judgment on the kid.""","""He's 14, he's growing up still,"" Chism's uncle says .

"(CNN) -- The Beverly Hills Hotel has been a haven for Hollywood's elite since 1912 -- two years before the City of Beverly Hills was even created. But now some stars are rushing for the exits. On Monday, a number of celebrities took part in a demonstration across from the famed Sunset Boulevard lodge, protesting not the hotel but its ownership -- an investment group controlled by the Sultan of Brunei. In late April, the small Muslim nation on the northern coast of the island of Borneo implemented Sharia law, marked by strong punishments for those found guilty of homosexuality or adultery -- including stoning the convicted to death. The law was praised by the sultan, who isn't just the country's ruler but also a major political and cultural figure. ""We're just making people aware,"" Jay Leno, who was among the demonstrators, told CNN. ""It's not a political issue. This is not something that's debatable. ... It's people being stoned to death,"" he said. A number of organizations have moved -- or threatened to move -- events scheduled for the hotel. The Los Angeles Times reported that the Feminist Majority Foundation moved its Global Women's Rights Awards from the Beverly Hills Hotel to the Hammer Museum in nearby Westwood. The awards, which were held Monday night, are co-chaired by Leno and his wife, Mavis. The International Women's Media Foundation similarly pulled its Courage in Journalism Awards ceremony from the venue. ""We, the IWMF, can no longer hold an event at a venue whose owner stands for the violation of the very human rights we fight for,"" Elisa Lees Munoz, executive director of the IWMF, said in a statement. Also saying they're staying away, according to the Los Angeles Times: The Hollywood Reporter's annual Women in Entertainment breakfast, the Motion Picture & Television Fund's Night Before the Oscars and a fundraising luncheon hosted by Teen Line, a peer helpline. Moreover, such notables as Ellen DeGeneres and mogul Richard Branson have announced they won't patronize the hotel or other properties in the Dorchester Collection of luxury hotels, which owns and manages the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Hotel Bel-Air. ""I won't be visiting the Hotel Bel-Air or the Beverly Hills Hotel until this is resolved,"" DeGeneres tweeted to her 28.8 million followers. Leno said he was well aware of the concerns. ""I know a number of people are canceling events at the hotel, and it's all economics,"" he told CNN. But Christopher Cowdray, the Dorchester Collection's CEO, said the celebrities and groups protesting are taking out their anger on the wrong place. ""The actions they're taking are unfounded,"" he said. ""It's going to hurt our employees and this has nothing to do with them whatsoever,"" he said. ""It's not their fight."" The sultan has owned the Beverly Hills Hotel since 1987. The Dorchester Collection was established in 1996 to oversee that hotel and others in its luxury portfolio, including the Hotel Bel-Air, Paris' Plaza Athenee and London's Dorchester. Cowdray said that celebrities wanting to influence politics in Brunei would be better off lobbying the U.S. State Department to take action. At a briefing Monday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said, ""We have very serious concerns."" The City of Beverly Hills is also making its opinion known. Mayor Lili Bosse is introducing a resolution before City Council that would urge the sultan to divest his interest in the hotel that bears the city's name. ""We have a history of standing strong against injustice,"" she said. Like Leno, she emphasized that the issue wasn't the hotel, but what was going on in Brunei. ""The resolution is not a call for a boycott of the Beverly Hills Hotel,"" she said. ""This is really a focus on the government and their laws and not a statement about the hotel."" CNN's Todd Leopold contributed to this story.","NEW: Organizations have moved -- or threatened to move -- scheduled events .

"(CNN) -- Has our generation become the victim of too much information? That's something to ponder as you update your Facebook status, answer your smartphone, glance at the TV and flip through the morning paper, with the radio blaring in the background. Bestselling author James Gleick has studied information -- from the invention of scripts and alphabets, to talking drums in Africa -- for his new book ""The Information"". ""Chaos,"" also written by the former reporter and editor for The New York Times, helped turn the ""Butterfly Effect"" into a household phrase. Gleick was also short-listed for the Pulitzer Prize for his biographies of Richard Feynman and Isaac Newton. CNN recently talked to the author about his latest book and the following is an edited transcript. CNN: For a nonscientist, how would you answer the question, ""What is information?"" And how has that definition changed over history? James Gleick: Luckily, we have the Oxford English Dictionary to help us. Unluckily, their definition is now pushing 10,000 words (as I discuss here). The important change -- really, the impetus for my book -- is that there is a scientific definition. It is a mathematical quantity, measured in bits and divorced from any notion of meaning. That was new as of the middle of the last century, and we can think of it as the official beginning of the information age. But we still need a human definition, too; now more than ever. For us, information includes words and sounds and pictures; paint on cave walls and ink on paper and smoke signals in the air. What is information? Information is how we know. CNN: Your book explains the concept of information using examples from around the world, from ancient history to present day. Did you develop any favorite cultures or figures as you wrote the book? Gleick: I'm probably not supposed to have a favorite person, but I do. I kind of fell in love with Ada Byron -- the daughter of the poet and a closet mathematician. She is a tragic figure, because she died an early and painful death and because she was a person living in the wrong time: a truly brilliant mathematician whose talents could not have been recognized until a century later. CNN: You say that technology does not define the information age, that it's the idea of information itself that's new. Can you explain the difference? Gleick: It's tempting to think the Information Age is about the very visible devices that are all around us, on our desks and in our pockets, profoundly changing the pacing and the flavor of our lives, but technology is just technology. What matters is communication -- one-to-many and one-to-one. We are aware of information as a big, general thing, but that wasn't always the case. CNN: You talk about an ""information flood."" Do we understand information better today than in our past, or is there just more of it to learn and consume? Gleick: Both. When I started writing the book, seven years ago, the initials T.M.I. stood for ""transmarginal inhibition"" or ""Texas Military Institute"" or ""Three Mile Island."" I don't need to tell you what TMI means now; every teenager knows. Yet it's a paradox: how can there be too much information when information is what we want, what we value, what we live for? We feel deluged -- unable to process it all, unable to find knowledge. CNN: You've gone from writing about ""Chaos"" to ""The Information,"" these books feel related, like you've completed a circle. Agree, disagree? Gleick: Agree. (With perhaps a question mark on the word ""completed."") It was from chaos theorists, 20 years ago, that I first heard the words ""information theory."" The connections between chaos and information are many and deep. One bridge is the notion of complexity itself. How do you measure complexity? It turns out that the complexity of a system is defined (and this is not a metaphor; it is mathematically exact) by the amount of information it contains. CNN: Any thoughts on what you want to tackle next? Gleick: A book! Only next time maybe a small one.","James Gleick wrote a new book ""The Information"" about history of information .

"(CNN)Their challenge is the Dawn Wall. Professional climbers Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson are in the middle of tackling this most difficult of challenges at Yosemite National Park's El Capitan. There are many routes up El Capitan, a 3,000-foot-tall granite monolith that has long beckoned thrillseekers. But only a handful have been attempted by climbers trying to free climb -- using only their hands and feet -- with ropes designed only to catch them when they fall. And perhaps no route is more challenging than the Dawn Wall, which offers few footholds and may be the most difficult climb in the world. A Yosemite National Park official confirmed that if they succeed, Caldwell and Jorgeson would be the first to successfully free-climb the smooth cliff face. That's why Caldwell and Jorgeson have spent several years planning and practicing their climb, assembling a support team that helps feed and care for them as they make their way up the wall. They chose to climb in winter so their hands won't sweat and there's more friction between their rubber soles and the rock. They relieve themselves in plastic bags. They sleep at night in pitched tents suspended on the wall, with Caldwell waking up twice per night to apply lotion to his hands. They've already been on the wall for more than 10 days. If all goes well, the climb should take a total of two to three weeks. Follow their journey on Caldwell and Jorgeson's Instagram accounts, Caldwell and Jorgeson's Facebook accounts and YouTube.","Two professional climbers are tackling El Capitan's biggest challenge .

"(CNN) -- Wanted by the Drug Enforcement Administration: Ebonics translators. It might sound like a punch line, as ""Ebonics"" -- the common name for what linguists call African-American English -- has long been the butt of jokes, as well as the subject of controversy. But the agency is serious about needing nine people to translate conversations picked up on wiretaps during investigations, Special Agent Michael Sanders said Tuesday. A solicitation was sent to contractors as part of a request to companies to provide hundreds of translators in 114 languages. ""DEA's position is, it's a language form we have a need for,"" Sanders said. ""I think it's a language form that DEA recognizes a need to have someone versed in to conduct investigations."" The translators, being hired in the agency's Southeast Region -- which includes Atlanta, Georgia; Washington; New Orleans, Louisiana; Miami, Florida; and the Caribbean -- would listen to wiretaps, translate what was said and be able to testify in court if necessary, he said. ""The concept is right and good,"" said Walt Wolfram, distinguished professor of English linguistics at North Carolina State University. ""Why wouldn't you want experts who can help you understand what people are communicating?"" ""On one level, it's no different than someone from the Outer Banks of North Carolina who speaks a distinct brogue,"" he said. ""The problem is that even the term 'Ebonics' is so controversial and politicized that it becomes sort of a free-for-all."" And Ebonics is no longer spoken only by African-Americans, Sanders said, referring to it as ""urban language"" or ""street language."" He said he is aware of investigations in recent years in which it was spoken by African-Americans, Latinos and white people. ""It crosses over geographic, racial and ethnic backgrounds,"" he said. ""[African-American English] is linguistic defiance being reinforced by hip-hop,"" said professor John Baugh, who leads the public relations committee of the Linguistic Society of America. The DEA's recruiting ""has it half right,"" Baugh said. Although having translation help is a good law enforcement tool, Baugh said, the term ""Ebonics"" may be counterproductive because ""the social positions of speakers have been the object of ridicule."" The Washington University professor also is concerned about racial profiling resulting from assumptions made from a speaker's dialect. While the DEA wants to have the translators available, it may not need to call upon them, Sanders said. He did not know how much it would cost to have the translators available. ""I can't say it's spoken all the time, like Spanish and Vietnamese,"" Sanders said. ""But there are people trying to use this to evade detection"" while trafficking in drugs, he said. Asked whether agency currently has agents who can translate Ebonics, Sanders said some who have worked on local police forces can help pick out words on wiretaps. The term ""Ebonics"" -- a blend of ""ebony"" and ""phonics"" -- became known in 1996, when the Oakland, California, Unified School District proposed using it in teaching English. After the school board came under fire, it voted to alter the plan, which recognized Ebonics as a distinct language. The revised plan removed reference to Ebonics as ""genetically based"" and as the ""primary language"" of students. The board also removed a part that some understood to indicate that African-American students would be taught in Ebonics, although the board denied such intentions. ""There is something of substance here,"" said Wolfram, who said he has studied African-American English for 40 years. ""There are differences in terms of language and lexicon and so forth that are difficult to understand for most people. So it is an issue. What, of course, happens is, it gets politicized and trivialized by the very term 'Ebonics.'"" The Linguistic Society of America calls Ebonics a form of communication that deserves recognition and study. ""Characterizations of Ebonics as 'slang,' 'mutant,' 'lazy,' 'defective,' 'ungrammatical' or 'broken English' are incorrect and demeaning,"" a 1997 resolution said. For Baugh, all languages or dialects are ""fundamentally equal."" Ebonics is a dialect spoken by slave descendants who live in many countries and don't speak just English, he said. Its early speakers were enslaved, isolated from other speakers of their language and denied access to formal education, Baugh said. Wolfram -- who has authored more than 20 books on English dialects, including African-American English -- recalled the Black Panther trials during the 1970s, when there was debate over whether the saying, ""Off the pigs,"" was a genuine threat to kill police officers or a more metaphorical saying. Wolfram acknowledged Ebonics often presented as ""nothing but bad language."" But, he said, ""However you view it ... why wouldn't you want to avail yourself of all the interpretive capability that you can get?"" African-American English is ""a systematic language variety, with patterns of pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary and usage that extend far beyond slang,"" according to the website of the Center for Applied Linguistics, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that says it aims to improve communication through better understanding of language and culture. ""Because it has a set of rules that is distinct from those of standard American English, characterizations of the variety as bad English are incorrect,"" the center said. ""Speakers of AAE do not fail to speak standard American English, but succeed in speaking African American English."" U.S. English, a political advocacy group, supports the DEA's recruitment, said Tim Schultz, director of government relations. ""Having somebody to explain slang terms ... spoken by a particular community is an advantage if it allows them to understand a conversation,"" he said. U.S. English's primary focus is making English the official language of the United States and backing laws that ensure immigrants learn English. Language barriers that contribute to conflicts between nations can be a ""serious issue,"" Wolfram noted. ""It's the same point here."" He said the translators could help in investigations, as ""the differences between dialect and code words can get pretty blurry at times."" Sanders said DEA plans to continue seeking the translators. ""African-American English is an evolving dialect and in some ways is growing in stature,"" Baugh said.","NEW: Linguistic Society says Ebonics a valid dialect .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Department of Defense recently purchased and destroyed thousands of copies of an Army Reserve officer's memoir in an effort to safeguard state secrets, a spokeswoman said Saturday. ""DoD decided to purchase copies of the first printing because they contained information which could cause damage to national security,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. April Cunningham said. In a statement to CNN, Cunningham said defense officials observed the September 20 destruction of about 9,500 copies of Army Reserve Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer's new memoir ""Operation Dark Heart."" Shaffer says he was notified Friday about the Pentagon's purchase. ""The whole premise smacks of retaliation,"" Shaffer told CNN on Saturday. ""Someone buying 10,000 books to suppress a story in this digital age is ludicrous."" Shaffer's publisher, St. Martin's Press, released a second printing of the book that it said had incorporated some changes the government had sought ""while redacting other text he (Shaffer) was told was classified."" From single words and names to entire paragraphs, blacked out lines appear throughout the book's 299 pages. CNN obtained a memo from the Defense Intelligence Agency dated August 6 in which Lt. Gen. Ronald Burgess claims the DIA tried for nearly two months to get a copy of the manuscript. Burgess said the DIA's investigation ""identified significant classified information, the release of which I have determined could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to national security."" Burgess said the manuscript contained secret activities of the U.S. Special Operations Command, CIA and National Security Agency. Shaffer's lawyer, Mark Zaid, said earlier this month that the book was reviewed by Shaffer's military superiors prior to publication. ""There was a green light from the Army Reserve Command,"" Zaid told CNN. But intelligence agencies apparently raised objections when they received copies of the book. The Pentagon contacted St. Martin's Press in early August to convey its concerns over the release of the book. According to the publisher, at that time the first printings were just about to be shipped from its warehouse. Shaffer said he and the publisher worked hard ""to make sure nothing in the book would be detrimental to national security."" ""When you look at what they took out (in the 2nd edition), it's lunacy,"" Shaffer said. The Pentagon says Shaffer should have sought wider clearance for the memoir. ""He did clear it with Army Reserve but not with the larger Army and with Department of Defense,"" Department of Defense spokesman Col. David Lapan said earlier this month. ""So he did not meet the requirements under Department of Defense regulations for security review."" One of the book's first lines reads, ""Here I was in Afghanistan (redaction) My job: to run the Defense Intelligence Agency's operations out of (redaction) the hub for U.S. operations in country."" In chapter 15, titled ""Tipping Point,"" 21 lines within the first two pages are blacked out. In the memoir, Shaffer recalls his time in Afghanistan leading a black-ops team during the Bush administration. The Bronze Star medal recipient told CNN he believes the Bush administraton's biggest mistake during that time was misunderstanding the culture there. Defense officials said they are in the process of reimbursing the publisher for the cost of the first printing and have not purchased copies of the redacted version. At least one seller on the online auction site eBay claiming to have a first-edition printing is selling it for an asking price of nearly $2,000. The listed retail price for the second printing is $25.99.","The Department of Defense says the memoir contained state secrets .

"(CNN) -- A medical student accused of killing a masseuse in a Boston, Massachusetts, hotel room will be charged in a hotel assault in Rhode Island, the state attorney general said Monday. Accused ""Craigslist killer"" Phillip Markoff is now facing additional charges in Rhode Island. Police said the attacker in both cases apparently responded to the victims' listings on the Craigslist online classified ad site. Philip Markoff, 23, will be charged with assault with the intent to rob, assault with a dangerous weapon, possession of a handgun and use of a firearm while committing a crime of violence, said Rhode Island Attorney General Patrick Lynch. The charges stem from an April 16 robbery attempt at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island.  Watch why Rhode Island officials issued an arrest warrant » . Markoff, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, previously was charged with killing Julissa Brisman on April 14 at a Boston hotel. Police said Brisman, a New York resident, was a model who advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist. Prosecutors say she was shot three times at close range and suffered blunt head trauma. Markoff also has been charged in connection with an April 10 robbery of a woman at another hotel in Boston. She was robbed of $800 in cash and $250 in American Express gift cards, according to police reports.  Watch report on Markoff's alleged gambling problem, underwear collection » . The incident also is linked to a Craigslist ad, police said. Markoff pleaded not guilty in the April 14 and April 10 incidents and is being held without bail.

"Skype has disabled its password-reset feature after hackers discovered a security hole in the video-chat service that allows almost anyone to change a user's password and take control of their account. Skype said ""a small number of users"" may have been impacted. The company is investigating the problem. ""Early this morning we were notified of user concerns surrounding the security of the password reset feature on our website. This issue affected some users where multiple Skype accounts were registered to the same email address,"" Skype's Leonas Sendrauskas said in a posting Wednesday. ""We suspended the password reset feature temporarily this morning as a precaution and have made updates to the password reset process today so that it is now working properly,"" he added. ""We are reaching out to a small number of users who may have been impacted to assist as necessary. Skype is committed to providing a safe and secure communications experience to our users and we apologize for the inconvenience."" The issue was posted on a Russian forum two months ago, but did not become widely known until it gained traction recently on Reddit and was confirmed by The Next Web, a tech-news blog. To exploit the flaw, all hackers need to know is a victim's e-mail address tied to his or her Skype account. They then can use that e-mail address to create a new account, and minus a few steps, use a password-reset token to gain access to the user's account and lock out its original owner. Staffers at The Next Web said they reproduced the attack, step-by-step, and managed to access the Skype accounts of a writer and an editor (with their permission), using only their e-mail addresses.

"(CNN) -- I remember the day I rang the bell. When you finish radiation treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, there's a bell in the waiting room that you ring three times, and when you do, the entire room erupts with applause. I remember the immediate rush when it was my turn. I felt the euphoric joy of having survived. It's an elation that comes along with being alive and knowing that you've made it past chemotherapy, radiation and surgery, with clean margins. I felt deep gratitude for my medical caregivers, my generous friends and my family, especially my family. That was nine years ago. But still, even now, I have unanswered questions about the disease that almost cut my life short. At age 38, I was given six months to live. I had sarcoma, a rare cancer that can occur in bone or soft tissue, with no known cause and no cure. My lingering questions about sarcoma fuels my motivation to produce ""Until 20,"" a documentary that follows James Ragan's quest to live his few remaining days of life fully. When I met James he was about to turn 20. We had both won the sarcoma cancer lottery. My 4-inch tumor was found growing along the radial nerve in my right arm. James's tumor resulted in the removal of about 40% of his left femur and 20% of his tibia. The five-year survival rate for this disease is frighteningly low. According to the National Cancer Institute, the five-year survival rate is about 66%. For me, after getting to know James the mystery of why I survived and many people do not triggered ""survivor's guilt."" This is the guilt that can occur when someone survives a traumatic event that others do not, such as accidents, war, natural disasters and even illnesses like cancer. Guilt is a complicated emotion. My cancer fight lasted a year and a half, and now, as far as my doctors know, there no active tumor cells in my body. I survived. James didn't. After repeated recurrences and seven major surgeries since his diagnosis at age 13, he died in February. We were fortunate enough that James chose to share the final year of his life with us. James said, ""It's all about perspective. I'm constantly told that's what I provide people when they hear my story. I'm told that I give them new perspective on their life."" Like James, I prefer to ask ""now that I been marked by this disease, what can I do to make a difference?"" I had cancer. I was lucky. Now I look ahead. ""Until 20"" is James' story. He should be an inspiration, not just for patients facing incurable diseases, and be seen as someone who encouraged adults and young people to make meaningful, values-based choices with their time and their lives. This documentary chronicles James' life after diagnosis, as he grows from a young athlete blindsided by disease into a passionate and caring young man. James shows us that you don't have to live a long life to make a difference. Sarcoma tumors develop in healthy people with no apparent risk factors. There's little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to find a cure for sarcoma. One percent of all adult cancers in America are sarcoma, and 15% of all childhood cancers are sarcoma. With so few cases, there's little money to be made from research. I have no patience with ""my cancer is worse than your cancer"" conversations. Cancer is not a competition. Cancer causes us all pain, and having a rare cancer is exponentially devastating, because there is so little research being done. The only remedy is banding together to create awareness and pushing for research funding. According to Dr. Ara Vaporciyan at MD Anderson, ""one option would be to put in place some rules or some laws that protect drug companies to allow them to invest research dollars. And in some sort of tax reform or some way to encourage them to invest here, to make it worth their while to invest here."" Why do we wait for a disease to teach us about living well and having compassion for others? James changed my life. In his deliberate quest to live a life worth living, he reminded me to live as though my days are numbered and to make every day count. You just need grit, passion and focused purpose. Humor helps, too. I have to believe that one of the most effective ways to move beyond survivor's guilt is to find purpose in my experience. I've learned lessons I couldn't have learned any other way. What seemed to be my premature death sentence has also become my good fortune. James gave me renewed perspective. ""Am I sad about everything I am going to miss out on in life? Absolutely,"" said James. ""But I am at peace. I've lived a pretty incredible 20 years.""

"Brunei has become the first East Asian country to adopt sharia law, despite widespread condemnation from international human rights groups. The Islamic criminal law is set to include punishments such as flogging, dismemberment and death by stoning for crimes such as rape, adultery and sodomy. The religious laws will operate alongside the existing civil penal code. During a ceremony Wednesday morning, the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, announced the commencement of the first phase of the sharia-based penal code, according to the government's official website. The oil-rich kingdom, located on the island of Borneo, has a population of just 412,000 people. The country already follows a more conservative Islamic rule than neighboring Muslim-dominated countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, and has implemented strict religiously-motivated laws, such as the banning of the sale of alcohol. Stringent laws . In response to the new set of laws, human rights group Amnesty International said that it will ""take the country back to the dark ages."" ""It (the law) makes a mockery of the country's international human rights commitments and must be revoked immediately,"" Amnesty's regional deputy director Rupert Abbott said in a statement released after the announcement. Most parts of the new Islamic code will apply to both Muslims and non-Muslims, affecting people from the Christian and Buddhist communities. Around 70 percent of people in Brunei are Malay Muslims, while the remainder of the population are of Chinese or other ethnic descent. The Sultan, who is also the Prime Minister, first announced the law in October 2013. As per its provisions, sexual offenses such as rape, adultery and sodomy will be considered punishable acts for Muslims. Consensual sex between homosexuals will also be criminalized, with death by stoning the prescribed punishment. In announcing the implementation of sharia law, the government website quoted the Sultan as saying that his government ""does not expect other people to accept and agree with it, but that it would suffice if they just respect the nation in the same way that it also respects them."" Widespread condemnation . LGBT advocacy groups in Asia have voiced their opposition to Brunei's implementation of sharia law. ""It may open the floodgates for further human rights violations against women, children, and other people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity,"" officials from the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health (APCOM) and Islands of South East Asian Network on Male and Transgender Sexual Health (ISEAN), said in a joint statement released last week. The United Nations has also publicly condemned the move. ""Under international law, stoning people to death constitutes torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and is thus clearly prohibited,"" Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a press briefing in Geneva last month. Anti-women provisions . He further expressed concerns about the implementation of sharia law's impact on women. ""A number of UN studies have revealed that women are more likely to be sentenced to death by stoning, due to deeply entrenched discrimination and stereotyping against them."" More than 40,000 people have attended briefing sessions organized by the government in the last four months to understand the provisions under the new Islamic criminal law, the country's religious affairs minister said during a ceremony to mark the laws' implementation.","Brunei has become the first East Asian country to adopt sharia law .

"(CNN) -- One of the many questions surrounding the revelation that Americans Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol received a little-known, experimental serum for their Ebola infection is: ""Why did we hear nothing about it earlier, and how did they gain access to it?"" Ebola has no cure, although potential medications and vaccines are in various states of development. The serum ZMapp, an experimental product of Mapp Biopharmaceutical, hasn't been tested in humans, which means it doesn't meet a primary requirement for FDA approval -- so its obscurity is no surprise. The Americans managed to gain access to what more than 1,660 infected people in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and now Nigeria did not: medicine that seems to work -- although, of course, we don't know for sure yet. Some reports indicate they received ZMapp under the FDA's ""compassionate use"" rule, which permits untested drugs to be given to consenting patients who might otherwise die. This is a triumph of common sense and compassion over bureaucratic red tape. One of the chief concerns about using unapproved medications is that we don't know what the risks are: The drug may not work, it may work with serious adverse effects, or it may prove as deadly as the disease. But as a doctor, Brantly understood the risks, and like him, Writebol had no other options. Most people with Ebola die. Compassionate use is certainly ethically defensible. But apparently only three doses were available, and they were given to Westerners. The lack of broader access to ZMapp highlights what is often a very serious ethical failing. 9 questions about this new Ebola drug . Why didn't Dr. Sheik Umar Khan, the chief Sierra Leone physician who died while treating Ebola patients, receive this medication? Because another method of determining who gets medications is at work here -- the drearily familiar stratification of access to a drug based on economic resources and being a Westerner rather than a resident of the global South. No health worker wants to intentionally deprive Africans of a needed drug. But informal medical networks, which Africans lack, connect well-to-do Westerners with information and drugs. In addition, the pharmaceutical industry has a history of declining to test medications for diseases of the tropical world, most of whose inhabitants cannot afford high prices. We don't know how quickly ZMapp could be made in large quantities. If it were to be made available, who should receive it? Some think Ebola doctors and caregivers should, because their survival is essential to treating and quelling the epidemic. This makes sense, but it's not that simple. First, it violates the principle of distributive justice: The benefits of the drug are being inequitably distributed, with skilled, economically secure professionals more likely to benefit. Also, by what reckoning do we decide that the doctors' role increases their value and dictates they should be given a preferential chance to survive? Distributing the drug through a clinical trial would allow us to know whether and how well the medication works and what caveats might apply. Africans must participate in any clinical trial, which would benefit the pharmaceutical company as well as, it's hoped, Ebola victims. This would mean their lives have irreplaceable value, too, in the equation of who should get the drug. So, will Africans receive this potentially lifesaving medication? A U.N. official suggested that drugs cannot be tested in the middle of an epidemic -- but he is wrong. Such tests are conducted all the time. Dr. David Ho tested AIDS drugs in Uganda in the midst of the pandemic, and the meningitis drug Trovan was tested in Kano, Nigeria, in the midst of an epidemic. One of every three industry trials is conducted in developing countries; scientists often point to high disease rates, including epidemics, as a rationale for conducting them there. The problem is not testing the drug amid an epidemic. The question is how ethically such trials are conducted. Only small amounts of ZMapp are available now, but as soon as it can be made in quantity, the drug for Ebola should be made available to Africans in all the regions that are threatened by the epidemic, regardless of ability to pay. If possible, it should be distributed within clinical trials to determine the safety and efficiency of the medications. Many people assume this requires withholding medications in a control group, but this is not necessarily the case. Experts should and can mount a well-designed study that permits early access to the medication to all who need it. But if they cannot ensure that sick people get the drug early, then a clinical trial should not be any more of a requirement for poor Africans than it was for Kent Brantly. It's also natural to wonder whether the threat of Ebola to the Western world, not to Africans, drives this initiative because so few such drugs are devised for Africans. This simply highlights another reason why we should so our utmost to protect people from Ebola: our medical interdependence. If Ebola makes landfall in the United States, we will need drugs like ZMapp, just as Africans need them today.","Americans with Ebola received an experimental medicine that seemed to help .

"Washington (CNN)Sen. Barbara Boxer announced Thursday that she will not run for reelection in 2016, setting up a big money political battle for her seat in the nation's most populous state. Boxer, the 74-year-old Democratic junior Senator from California, said that she is not retiring from public life and will continue working on ""the issues that I love"" through her political action committee, PAC for a Change. Boxer was first elected to the Senate in 1992. ""I am never going to retire,"" Boxer said. ""The work is too important."" Boxer's decision sets off one of the most competitive races for a statewide seat in California's recent history, and the field to replace her began to shape up within hours. The state's deep bench of Democratic rising stars sets up the prospect of a fierce intra-party fight for the seat. Multiple Democrats on Capitol Hill have already expressed interest, with a source close to Rep. Loretta Sanchez telling CNN she's keeping the door open to a run but has no time frame for a decision. Rep. John Garamendi also said he would consider it in a statement, and called Boxer an ""outstanding senator and public servant."" ""I have been asked by several people to consider the U.S. Senate because of my years of service in the U.S. Congress and having been elected statewide as Lieutenant Governor and Insurance Commissioner, along with executive experience in the Interior Department. I will consider it, but my first duty is to the people of the 3rd Congressional District,"" he said. Others, still, have already taken themselves out of the running. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer isn't interested, a spokesman said, and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who is considered a strong contender for statewide office in the future, ruled himself out of the race in a statement Thursday. ""The first thing we should do today is thank Senator Barbara Boxer for being a powerful champion for our city, state and nation in the United States Senate,"" Garcetti said in a statement. ""I love my job and I love my city and I am committed to the work here. I will not run for Sen. Boxer's seat."" California Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon also isn't interested, his spokesman said. All eyes have turned to Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who all have deep fundraising bases in California and are seen as top contenders for the seat. None have commented on their interest in the race, though both Harris and Newsom issued releases commending Boxer for her decades of service. Both Harris and Newsom have expressed strong interest to their confidantes in running for the U.S. Senate seat, but both are also intrigued by the possibility of running for Governor when Jerry Brown leaves office — setting up the possibility that they could work out a deal, particularly since they share the same political consultant, California-based strategist Ace Smith. In what was viewed as a tea leaf indicating that possibility, Harris took the surprise role of administering the oath to Newsom on Jan. 5 when he was sworn in for his second term as Lieutenant Governor. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein told reporters in the Capitol on Thursday she thinks there's ""a high likelihood"" that Newsom and Villaraigosa will run, and that she's heard of a few House members interested in the race as well. But she said California's jungle primary system — which pits all candidates, regardless of party, against each other in a first round of voting, with the top two vote-getters proceeding to a faceoff in November — makes it difficult to peg a frontrunner at this point. ""It's hard to predict how people do in that kind of race,"" she said. Feinstein also noted that because of the size of the state, it's important for candidates to coalesce support quickly. ""Most candidates don't realize until they've run how big the state is and how you have to reach people,"" she said. ""It really comes down to media, unfortunately.  And that's the part of it.  It's costly."" Any of those potential candidates could face a formidable challenge from Billionaire Tom Steyer, who spent $74 million — much of it his own money — trying to sway the midterm elections by engaging voters on climate change without much in the way of results. Other possible contenders include Treasurer John Chiang, Secretary of State Alex Padilla and Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones. ""Every house member looks in the mirror and sees a United States Senator,"" said Dan Schnur, executive director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. ""So there are probably 52 members of Congress in California thinking about running for Boxer's seat this morning."" While California remains a deep-blue state, and the GOP bench of candidates there is thin, Republicans have floated the prospect of a wide field of Democratic contenders splitting the party's vote and allowing for a Republican to squeak through the primary to the general. But one of their top prospects, Rep. Darrell Issa, isn't interested in the race, according to a source close to the congressman. He declined to comment on his plans for the race to reporters earlier, but knocked Boxer, commenting that ""the fact that she's not running doesn't change the fact it's always been a vacant office."" Neither Rep. Ed Royce nor businesswoman Carly Fiorina will run, according to statements from their staff on Thursday. A GOP coup there remains a long shot, and on Thursday Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Jon Tester thanked Boxer for giving Democrats enough time to line up a credible candidate. ""I appreciate that Senator Boxer has made an early decision, giving us more than enough time to get behind a strong Democratic candidate who will hold this seat,"" he said, adding they're ""confident"" they'll reelect a Democrat to the seat. Boxer explained her decision to not seek re-election in a mock interview with her oldest grandson in a video posted to YouTube. The liberal senator added that she plans to help Democrats' 2016 candidate for president ""make history."" Boxer has said repeatedly that former Secretary of State Hillary Cllinton should run for president and has fundraised for the Ready For Hillary PAC. She also said she is committed to ensuring her Senate seat stays in the hands of progressive Democrats and is, ultimately, anxious to return to California. The unapologetic liberal was one of her party's most outspoken advocates on environmental issues and routinely sparred with Republicans as head of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee. But she was also known for forging bipartisan relationships and compromises, and earned the respect of some of the GOP's most conservative members for her work on transportation and infrastructure issues. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California became emotional during a press conference on Thursday when a reporter asked her about Boxer's announcement. Pelosi was caught off guard by the question and hadn't yet found out. ""It's funny -- she called me, she said she wanted to talk to me personally. I thought she wanted to maybe to have dinner tonight,"" Pelosi said. ""Her leaving will be a great loss to the Congress of the United States, people of California, and to our country."" Pelosi called Boxer, who is just under 5 feet tall ""small in size, but a giant in terms of her contribution."" Pelosi on Boxer retirement: 'What?' Boxer emphasized that her age was not a factor in her decision, nor was the hyper-partisan environment that has dominated Washington in recent years. ""When you stand up there and you fight to make sure there's a strong middle class and you protect a woman's right to choose and you fight for jobs and a clean environment...all those things are a fight worth making,"" Boxer said in the video. She added that her age was ""definitely not"" a factor. ""Some people are old at 40, some people are young at 80. I feel as young as I did when I got elected. I was in my 50s,"" Boxer said. California's senior Sen. Dianne Feinstein, also a Democrat, is the oldest current serving member of the Senate. She has not announced her decision on running for reelection in 2018. Boxer, who apparently has a fondness for rhymes, closed the ""interview"" with a few rhymes. ""The Senate is the place where I've always made my case. For families, for the planet and the human race. More than 20 years in a job I love, thanks to California and the Lord above. So although I wont be working from my senate space and I wont' be running in that next tough race. As long as there are issues and challenges and strife, I will never retire because that's the meaning of my life.""","Boxer announced her decision not to run for reelection in 2016 in a YouTube video with her grandson .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The personal records of thousands of soldiers, employees and their families were potentially exposed after a laptop computer containing the information was stolen over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, the military says. But information security experts for the Army say it's unlikely that the information will be compromised because the data are guarded by three layers of security and encryption passwords. The security breach happened when the rental apartment of an employee with the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Academy was burglarized in Clermont, Florida, officials said. The theft was reported to local police November 28, but the military was not notified until the employee returned to work three days later. Military officials say the employee was using the laptop for remote training courses, and it has not been determined whether any protocol was breached. The computer contained ""names and personally identifiable information for slightly more than 42,000 Fort Belvoir Morale, Welfare and Recreation patrons,"" according to a posting on the Web site for the fort, which is in Virginia. CNN obtained the notification letter sent, almost two weeks later, to those affected. It says, in part, that the alleged compromised information ""includes your name, Social Security number, home address, date of birth, encrypted credit card information, personal e-mail address, personal telephone numbers, and family member information."" The letter recommends steps to guard against the possibility of identity theft. The military says the lag in notification time was because of a policy requiring risk assessment before alerting those affected. The Family and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Command operates facilities such as child care centers, bowling centers and outdoor recreation facilities. Those facilities are available to anyone with a military ID, which includes active-duty troops, Department of Defense civilians, family members and retirees. This isn't the first time a missing laptop has resulted in a potential security breach for the military. In 2006, a Veterans Affairs Department analyst lost a laptop computer that contained the Social Security numbers and other personal data for more than 26 million veterans and active duty troops. That incident, in addition to other major data breaches, prompted a national call for protection of personal information. A bill currently under consideration in the Senate would put more protections in place.","Employee's laptop containing personal data was stolen over holiday weekend .

"When IBM's Watson system defeated the human champion on ""Jeopardy!"" in February 2011, it surprised the world with its unprecedented command of a vast array of facts, puns, and clever questions. But how will that feat change our lives over the next decade? What does it mean for the future of intelligent machines? Watson accumulated its wide-ranging knowledge by ""reading"" the equivalent of millions of books, foreshadowing a revolution in how computers acquire, analyze, and create knowledge. Read more: Ray Kurzweil's future of humanity . Given the explosive volume of text available to anyone today in the form of web pages, articles, tweets and more, automatic machine reading is a critical part of technology's future. Here are five ways we predict the Machine-Reading Revolution will change your life in the coming decade: . 1. Being a scientific assistant: By 2020, machine reading and understanding of scientific text has the potential to accelerate breakthroughs like helping find new cures to diseases or solutions to climate change. The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence's Aristo project is building software that will enable computers to ""learn"" from textbooks, ask questions, and draw tentative conclusions. Building on this, and related projects like Watson, this kind of assistant will become an indispensable tool for scientists and researchers. Read more: I'm the original voice of Siri . 2. Answering questions:  When you ask your  smartphone a specific question like ""when's the next flight to Atlanta?"" or even ""what's President Obama's current approval rating?"" You'll be able to receive direct and concise answers on your device. Programs like Siri and Google Now can already answer spoken questions like ""when's the next Yankees game?"" Over the coming decade, the range of answerable questions will broaden substantially, and the answers will be based not only on databases of facts, but also on information automatically extracted and synthesized from news, web pages, and tweets. Thus (as Etzioni anticipated in 2011):  On our phones, ten blue links will gradually become a thing of the past. 3. Being an online shopping concierge: We foresee an automated concierge that makes personalized product recommendations based on your tastes and reading all available reviews on the Web. Today, if you want to find a quiet hotel in mid-town Manhattan, you may be forced to spend hours combing through hotel reviews to figure out which ones are relevant, authentic, and informative. Read more: Siri says 'dump him' In just a few years, a computer will comb through the reviews for you. Research prototypes like Huang and Etzioni's RevMiner have already shown that computers can read and analyze reviews with high accuracy. It's only a matter of time before shopping excursions are truly one-click endeavors. 4. Acting as an automated medical assistant: Imagine getting an immediate ""second opinion"" based on the latest medical studies and experiments right in your doctor's office, or even in the comfort of home. Today, any doctor is overwhelmed by the deluge of new medical studies and discoveries. By 2023, your doctor will have a tireless medical assistant who keeps up with the scientific literature on his or her behalf, and warns against potential errors such as unnoticed drug interactions, dangerous side effects, and more. 5. Delivering real-time statistics: Within a decade, authoritative statistics on health, inflation, and unemployment will be available in real-time, benefiting both policy makers and the general public. Read more: The best Twitter jokes about Amazon's drones . Today, we often find out about the outbreak of epidemics, health hazards, and economic concerns long after the fact. Yet status updates on social media can reveal important clues about our location, community health, and even employment status immediately. Research is underway to anticipate epidemics and address other public health questions that today are studied via surveys and slower, less-inclusive methods. Henry Kautz reports on research to monitor food poisoning outbreaks in New York City, University of Michigan researchers are computing analogous statistics for unemployment, and the Billion Prices Project at MIT provides far richer inflation measurements than the government's official index. In the near future, approximations to official data will be available instantaneously. Read more: Forget flying cars, check out these flying robots . We recently launched the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) in Seattle to carry out basic research in the area of machine reading and understanding of text, which will enable the broader community to pursue the above innovations. Within a decade, computer knowledge acquired from ""Big Text"" will be available at any time, any place, and accessible via a dialog that would make the Star Trek Communicator proud and put Siri to shame. As Allen observed in 2011, the singularity is far beyond the horizon, but the Machine-Reading Revolution is coming to a mobile device near you.","IBM's Watson system defeated the human champion on ""Jeopardy!"" in February 2011 -- surprising the world .

"Uncertainty normally comes with the new. This year's Brazilian presidential elections, though, have been like no other. After Sunday's polls gave President Dilma Rousseff, from the left-wing Worker's Party (PT), another four-year term with a narrow margin of victory, Brazilians embarked on a guessing exercise about what her next government will look like. On the surface it doesn't seem a vote for change, but the President knows it should be. There were exuberant celebrations in the PT camp and frustration in the faces of supporters of the defeated centrist candidate, Aecio Neves, from PSDB. But no one could say for sure what the result means for the next four years. Since massive street protests in June 2013 called for change in Brazilian politics and economy, that word has been around in almost every political statement -- including Rousseff's victory speech on Sunday night. As she addressed supporters in Brasilia, the President said she had not forgotten the message from the streets. ""The most repeated word in these elections has been 'change'. And I know that I have been re-elected to make the big changes the Brazilian society demands."" Rousseff had already hinted that her second term will be different from her first -- ""new government, new ideas"" was her campaign slogan. ""I want to be a much better president than I've been so far"", she said on Sunday, while also talking about ""building bridges"" with political opponents. The challenges, in the economy and in politics, are huge. So what should Brazilians expect? In her speech, she mentioned wide-ranging political reform. A new direction in the economy? Unlikely. A friendlier approach towards a fragmented Congress? Who knows. A more positive dialogue with the private sector? Possibly. Or nothing of that sort. Dilma Rousseff Part II is still to be revealed. Almost half of the country wanted a different outcome. Rousseff won with 51.6% of the valid votes, while Neves received 48.4% -- the closest presidential election result in 25 years. The President's performance was 1.4 million votes short of the 55.8 million she got four years ago, while the opposition increased their base from 43.7 million in 2010 to 50.9 million. Brazilians endured three months of a fiercely fought campaign -- or as some have called it, ""dirty"" and ""shameful"" after a number of personal attacks that were both baseless and tasteless. Many voters lost their composure too, with political differences ruining friendships and keeping relatives apart. A wish that something new would come out of this battle was evident in late August when, after the tragic death of socialist candidate Eduardo Campos in a plane crash, his running mate and environmentalist Marina Silva took the helm on their ticket. In a few weeks opinion polls showed Silva ahead of Dilma Rousseff in a second round simulation. But the scaremongering from the government's camp that Silva's lack of political support could lead her government to collapse made her support drop as quickly as it had risen. The task of trying to dethrone Rousseff in the second round fell to Aecio Neves, with support from a defeated Marina Silva. Brazilians watched the sixth edition of the same PT vs. PSDB face-off that has marked every Brazilian presidential election since 1994. Dilma Rousseff was re-elected thanks to her party's record in power. In the 12 years that the PT has governed Brazil, extreme poverty has been reduced by more than half. Social programs that increased the income of the poorest now reach 14 million families, most of them in northern regions. In those areas, Rousseff easily won the trust of the voters, beating her opponent by margins that reached 70%. But she came close to losing the election due to poor recent economic results and the word that many today associate with her party's red star: corruption. Although the unemployment rate remains low, at 5%, analysts expect layoffs to increase in the months to come. Brazil's economy is technically in recession -- its GDP fell in the last two quarters -- and the IMF predicts only 0.3% growth in 2014. Members of Rouseff's PT party were convicted and jailed for illegal campaign funding and the bribing of Congressmen. And a new (and still ongoing) corruption scandal at the heart of Petrobras, the Brazilian state oil company, hit the government at its core. Poor economic data and sleaze are issues that tend to shock and concern the better-off and well-educated, mainly located in the south of Brazil, where Aecio Neves performed very well. In the State of Sao Paulo, the richest and most populated, he got 64% of the vote. Massive street protests, a stalled economy, corruption; Dilma Rousseff survived it all -- just. Her main tasks now are to unite a divided nation, find a way of making Brazil's economy grow again, bring down an inflation rate that is stubbornly high (6.75%) and change something. The Brazilian President knows that she has not won this contest because of what she's promised to do in the future, as she didn't even present a formal plan for her second term. She's won because of the past, and the future is still being planned. In opinion polls, 70% of Brazilians have repeatedly said they wanted change in the federal government. Unsure about how to achieve that, they decided to close their eyes, keep things as they are and hope for the best.","With more than 99% of votes counted, incumbent Dilma Rousseff had 51.59% of the vote .
Simões: Result wasn't a vote for change, but the President knows she must make changes .
Simões: Rousseff didn't win because of her plan for the future -- she won for past performance ."
"Four New York-area men were arrested Monday after a BASE jumping stunt from atop One World Trade Center in September, police said. The charges against James Brady, Kyle Hartwell, Marko Markovich and Andrew Rossig included burglary, reckless endangerment and jumping from a structure, according to a statement issued by NYPD Commissioner William Bratton. ""These men violated the law and placed themselves, as well as others, in danger,"" Bratton said. ""These arrests should send a message to anyone thinking about misusing a landmark this way."" Three of the men are accused of climbing the nation's tallest building on September 30 and parachuting more than 1,300 feet off the skyscraper, said attorney Timothy Parlatore, who is representing Rossig. Hartwell is accused of keeping lookout at the base of the tower during the stunt, Parlatore said. Video footage of the early morning jump shows the men deploying their parachutes and flying down to a secluded spot on a nearby highway, according to Parlatore, who said he's seen the video. ""They were very professional, very controlled. There was nothing haphazard or reckless about it,""he said. At the time of the incident, Brady was a construction worker assigned to work at the One World Trade Center site, police said. The men snuck into the area through a hole in a fence, said Parlatore. ""One of the first things my client said to me was that how surprised he was at how there was no security whatsoever -- how easy it was to just walk right up there in something that the mayor has just recently described as the No. 1 terrorist target in the world,"" he said. Investigators reviewed video footage from around One World Trade Center, as well as other electronic and photographic evidence. A search of the men's homes last month produced video footage of the jump, police said. One World Trade Center is rising in the shadows of the original World Trade Center, where the twin towers were felled by two hijacked airplanes on September 11, 2001, in the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil. The charges come less than a week after a 16-year-old boy from New Jersey was arrested on trespassing charges at the skyscraper. Justin Casquejo is accused of sneaking past security and climbing to the top of the building. Police said Casquejo also snuck in through a hole in a fence to get into the One World Trade Center site. It is unclear whether it was the same hole in a fence that the BASE jumpers said they used, said Parlatore. BASE is an acronym for building, antenna, span, earth. It was not known Monday night when the men would be arraigned. ""The Port Authority joins the NYPD in condemning this lawless and selfish act that clearly endangered the public,"" Port Authority Chief Security Officer Joseph Dunne said in a statement. ""It should be clear that the PAPD and NYPD will go to any length to bring those who defile the WTC site to justice."" The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey owns the trade center site.","BASE jumping incident from skyscraper occurred in September .

"(CNN)Social media users expressed solidarity with satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo after terrorists targeted its office in Paris on Wednesday, killing 12 people. Using the hashtage #JeSuisCharlie, many on Twitter replaced their profile photo with a white-on-black image of the phrase, which translates to ""I am Charlie."" It's the phrase that appeared on the Charlie Hebdo website, which linked to a file showing the same phrase repeated in several languages. Cartoonists and other artists tweeted images that summed up the outrage felt over the attack. One, by The Canberra Times' political cartoonist David Pope, shows a smoking gun, with a gunmen saying, ""He drew first."" Pope said he sketched the image at 2 a.m. before he went to bed. ""I was trying to express an emotional response,"" he told CNN. ""I'm not trying to make a cheap joke out of it, just trying to express something that hopefully other people are also feeling."" He said the rights of cartoonists must be defended. ""As a cartoonist you are always pushing that line and they pushed it very hard. (But) nothing justified the violent events that happened last night."" It was shared tens of thousands of times, as were others that depicted the strength of the pencil versus the gun. Matt Davies, cartoonist for Newsday, expressed shock that anyone would be motivated enough to kill over a cartoon. His image, penned after the attack, showed a confused gunman holding a pencil and asking, ""Where's the trigger?"" ""Cartoons are supposed to be offensive, sometimes. And people roll with it. You look at a cartoon, and you say ""that's offensive"" and you write a letter to the editor,"" he told CNN. He said the attack caused ""a moment of pause"" but said he didn't think that political cartoonists would become less satirical in response. As the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists condemned what it called a ""revolting act of  violence,"" cartoonists around the world did what they do best to show that would not be cowed. Among the messages of defiance, were images of grief.  This one was posted by Patrick Chappatte from the International New York Times, in memory of his colleagues and friends at Charlie Hebdo. Magnus Shaw, a copywriter and blogger, tweeted an original Charles M Schulz image of Charlie Brown, his head in his hands, sitting on a park bench. Above, he added the words ""Je Suis Charlie."" ""At around 4pm on Wednesday, I tweeted this image. Then it all went a bit nuts..."" Shaw wrote on his blog. He later tweeted: ""Charles M Schulz, wherever you are, I hope I didn't let you down."" An old New Yorker cartoon is recirculating of a blank page that the cartoonist captioned: ""Please enjoy this culturally, ethically, religiously and politically correct cartoon responsibly. Thank you."" An image released by cartoonist MacLeod comments on the power of a simple picture. In India, cartoonist Shreyas Navare drew a tribute from Quartz India to the victims of the attack, showing a cup holding pens outweighing the threats from assorted weaponry. And in the United Kingdom, the Telegraph's cartoonist, Matt,  showed one gunman saying to the other, ""Be careful, they might have pens."" People around the world tweeted their response to the killings, including expressions of support for free speech and the need to maintain the humor that some found offensive enough to kill. ""Terrorising people to not tell jokes. Killing people for telling jokes. More important than ever to keep joking. #Solidarite #JeSuisCharlie,"" read one tweet from Malaysia. ""Guns run out of bullets. Journalists will not run out of words. #JeSuisCharlie,"" read another tweet. Twitter was also used to call people to join in rallies in support of the victims throughout France on Wednesday evening. Jessica HammoutÃ¨ne sent CNN an iReport from a vigil in Lille, France. Journalists around the world expressed their sympathy and alliance with the principles Charlie Hebdo represents. One photo showed a newsroom of journalists at Agence France Presse in Paris holding signs that read ""Je suis Charlie."" Another showed journalists at French publication Le Figaro holding copies of Charlie Hebdo covers. Instagram was also buzzing with shows of support for the magazine. BÃ©nÃ©dicte Huot, who lives in La Seyne-sur-Mer, France, shared a tribute as part of the JeSuisCharlie movement on the site. ""Today, liberty is very fragile, but for me liberty is the one,"" he said. Some tweeted ""JeSuisCharlie"" with photos of four of the victims, cartoonists for the magazine. A small number of users wrote in support of the mass killings. One called it a defense of his religion. Another wrote it was a response to cartoon depictions of the Prophet Mohammed and said people couldn't remain silent. They used the hashtags that CNN translated to #We_Avenged_the_Prophet _of_God and #Paris_Is_Burning. CNN's Samira Said contributed to this report.","Tens of thousands tweet #JeSuisCharlie and Charlie Hebdo publishes the trending phrase on its site .

"Washington (CNN)Losing the majority in the Senate was bad news for most national Democrats. But for a few of outspoken liberals -- especially those with higher ambitions -- the minority may be a bit more fun. For the next two years, liberals like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren -- a pair oft-discussed during 2016 speculation -- will be able to use the Republican control as a foil for their rhetoric and message. They will also be more unencumbered by difficult votes thrust upon them by the White House and Democratic leadership. Republicans are now in control, meaning most votes they take will give them opportunities to blast their opponents and rally their base. Barbara Boxer is retiring, not running for reelection in 2016 . This was clear in the first meeting of the new Senate Energy Committee on Thursday, when Warren -- who has repeatedly said she isn't running for President -- used her first speech to lambast Republicans for kowtowing to foreign oil companies and business interests by pushing the Keystone XL pipeline. ""I want to know why the pipeline is the very first, No. 1 item on the agenda in the new Congress,"" Warren said of the 1,179-mile-long project that would move oil from Canada to refineries in the United States. After making the case that the pipeline was not about jobs or energy costs -- two points Republicans regularly make -- Warren upped her rhetoric. ""So it's not about jobs; it's not about energy. Why is this bill so urgent? The answer is money, money and power,"" Warren said. ""Who does this new Republican Congress work for, foreign oil companies or the American people? Today, their first priority is to advance a pipeline that means a whole lot to lobbyists and a giant foreign oil company."" Sanders, too, will likely use his position caucusing with the minority party (the senator is an independent who chooses to meet with Democrats) to needle both Republicans and the Obama administration. On free trade, for example, Sanders has already staked out a position that is antithetical to the White House when he wrote a letter to the administration blasting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade deal with 12 Pacific Rim countries. In particular, Sanders -- who is openly considering a 2016 run -- has accused the White House of creating the agreement in secret. ""It is incomprehensible to me that the leaders of major corporate interests who stand to gain enormous financial benefits from this agreement are actively involved in the writing of the TPP while, at the same time, the elected officials of this country, representing the American people, have little or no knowledge as to what is in it,"" he wrote. ""In my view, this is simply unacceptable,"" he said. Z. Byron Wolf contributed to this report.","Minority senators will have more freedom to needle Republicans and buck their party .
This could help a number of liberal senators, especially anyone eying the White House .
Warren - who says she isn't running for president - showed this by attacking Republicans on the Keystone XL pipeline ."
"(CNN)There's a new reality TV show, called ""My Husband's Not Gay,"" about four men in Utah who say they are attracted to men and yet have chosen to marry women. The show has stirred up controversy,  in some cases for all the wrong reasons. ""I think it's irresponsible to be airing a show with the content that gives the idea that sexual orientation is a choice,"" GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said. ""That a discredited and old idea."" ABC's Robin Roberts agreed: ""To even give the idea that it is a choice can be very dangerous, especially to young people who are dealing with their sexuality and trying to figure things out."" Much of the gay community's critique of the show centers around the fact that these four men, who are Mormon, are linked to deeply anti-gay ""reparative therapy"" that teaches men to ""pray away the gay."" This so-called ""therapy"" is as psychologically damaging to individual gay people as it is to our societal aspirations to be ever more equitable and tolerant. The show reinforces gay self-loathing by driving home the idea that being gay is inconsistent with being a person of faith. Nothing could be further from the truth. Maybe what needs changing isn't these men but the Mormon Church; that would be a better angle for a reality show. At the dawn of the gay rights movement, people wanted to liberate sexuality not only for gay men and women but also for everyone, expanding the range of sexual self-expression along a spectrum of identities. But some believed that gayness would be less threatening to the heterosexual status quo if it's wasn't a choice. The phrase ""sexual preference"" gave way to ""sexual orientation,"" suggesting something unchanging, the gay south to heterosexual north. Scientists hunted for the ""gay gene"" as proof that sexual orientation is fixed at birth. Lady Gaga's ""Born This Way"" seemed to seal the deal. Or did it? Some people think being gay is a choice; some disagree. The debate continues. But in a free society, everyone should be free to make a choice about sexuality. This may seem like a very disruptive notion to heterosexuality, but I've always favored a version of gayness that is very disruptive to the status quo. In the face of restrictive traditions that argue one should choose to not be gay, how should one respond? The best answer is that people should feel entirely free to choose whatever sexuality they want and that their choice should be celebrated and afforded full legal protections and cultural equality. Your sexual identity and self-expression should be up to you. And that is the problem at the heart of ""My Husband's Not Gay"" and ""reparative therapy"": not the idea that being gay might be a choice but that being straight is compulsory or forced, whether by religions of society in general. That compulsion is the problem. The antidote to that, simply, is choice. Mormons, for instance, choose to be Mormon. While most of us are born into a faith tradition, no one would seriously argue religious beliefs are written into our biology or DNA. But we honor and respect religious choices, and afford them protections under our laws because we are a nation that continually aspires to increasing freedom and self-determination. It's perfectly wonderful to choose to be Mormon.  It's perfectly wonderful to choose to be gay.  And it should be perfectly wonderful to choose to be both.  That would be a reality worth tuning in for.","Sally Kohn: A new reality TV show is about four gay Mormon men who are married to women .

"(CNN) -- The death and injury toll from a stampede at a Cambodian festival continued to rise Tuesday as families mourned. The number of deaths is now at 375 and the number of injured is up to 755, the country's official news agency said Tuesday. Cambodia has declared Thursday a national day of mourning for those who died Monday in the crush at the annual Water Festival in the capital city of Phnom Penh, the news agency AKP reported. On Tuesday some victims' families and leaders gathered for a religious ceremony for the dead. The government said it will help to transport the bodies of those who died and pay 5 million riel ($1,230) to the family of each of the deceased. The three-day festival, which began Saturday, is held each November near the palace to honor a victory by Cambodian naval forces during the 12th century reign of King Jayavarman VII, according to the country's tourism website. During the festival, which includes boat races, participants pray for a good rice harvest and enough rain, and celebrate the full moon, the site says. Visalsok Nou, a Cambodian Embassy official in Washington, said more than 4 million people were attending the Water Festival when the stampede occurred. The municipal police chief said the stampede, which began around 10 p.m., likely occurred because a suspension bridge packed with people began to sway, creating panic, said Philip Bader, a news editor with the Phnom Penh Post newspaper. Steve Finch, a journalist with the newspaper, said police began firing water cannons onto a bridge leading to an island in the center of a river in an effort to get them to continue moving across the bridge. ""That just caused complete and utter panic,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. A number of people lost consciousness and fell into the water, he said. The country has set up a commission to look into the incident.","NEW: An additional 755 people are reported injured at an annual festival .

"Sherwangei, Pakistan (CNN)  -- A passport bearing the name of Said Bahaji, a suspect linked to the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, has been found in a town captured by the Pakistani military. The passport was found in South Waziristan, where the Pakistani military has been battling to wrest territory from the Taliban in Pakistan. It contained a Pakistani visa issued in August 2001 showing that the bearer entered Pakistan on September 4, 2001, and appeared unusually new for a document eight years old. CNN has not independently confirmed its authenticity. Bahaji is suspected of having fled Germany for Pakistan on September 3, 2001, after receiving a tip that the attacks were imminent. The photo in the passport resembles images of Bahaji posted on Interpol's Web site. It shows a clean-cut man wearing a red sweater. Bahaji, 34, is alleged to have been a member of the Hamburg, Germany-based cell that provided money to the hijackers who carried out the September 11 attacks, which killed about 3,000 people. He is wanted in Germany and Spain on terrorism charges, according to Interpol. A U.S. counterterrorism official said only that Bahaji is a senior propagandist for al Qaeda who had ties to some of the September 11 hijackers and is very much of interest to the United States. He lived with one of the leaders of the hijackers, Mohammed Atta, in Germany before the attacks, according to the September 11 report. He is a German citizen of Moroccan descent. CNN's Reza Sayah saw the passport and another one from Spain along with other documents during a trip to South Waziristan for journalists run by the Pakistani military. It was the first time the army had taken journalists to the region since the offensive against the Taliban began on October 17th, he said. The army showed journalists a pile of documents that they said they had seized.

"A Chinese fighter jet made several ""dangerous"" and ""unprofessional"" passes at a U.S. Navy plane this week -- coming as close as 20 feet at one point -- in what the White House called a ""deeply concerning provocation."" The incident occurred Tuesday in international air space in the South China Sea about 135 miles east of the Chinese island of Hainan, the Pentagon said on Friday. Rear. Adm. John Kirby, the Defense Department spokesman, described a flamboyant approach by what he called an armed Chinese fighter jet that three times crossed beneath the Navy Poseidon patrol aircraft with ""only 100 feet of separation."" ""The Chinese jet also passed the nose of the P-8 at 90 degrees with its belly towards the P-8 Poseidon, we believe to make a point of showing its weapons load,"" he said. It then ""flew directly under and alongside the P-8, bringing their wing tips to within 20 feet, and then conducted a roll ... over the P-8, passing within 45 feet,"" Kirby added. Sounding exasperated, he called the maneuvers by the Chinese jet ""pretty aggressive, very unprofessional."" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said it was ""obviously a deeply concerning provocation and we have communicated directly to the Chinese government our objection to this type of action."" Rhodes said the United States has encouraged ""constructive military-to-military ties with China"" and ""this type of action ... violates the spirit of that engagement."" China slammed U.S. accusations, calling them ""totally groundless"" and saying its jet was within safe distance. The Chinese fighter jet was deployed to make ""regular identification and verification,"" Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun told state-run Xinhua news agency. Encounter recalls 2001 incident . In April 2001, a U.S. reconnaissance plane carrying a crew of 24 collided with a Chinese fighter, forcing the U.S. craft to make an emergency landing on Hainan. Blaming the United States for the incident, Chinese officials said their fighter crashed into the South China Sea -- killing the pilot. The United States called for the immediate return of the high-tech EP-3 aircraft and the crew. The crew were allowed to return to the United States 11 days after the collision -- and the dismantled spy plane was flown home some weeks later. China wary of Japan defense plans .

"Cancer cases are expected to surge 57% worldwide in the next 20 years, an imminent ""human disaster"" that will require a renewed focus on prevention to combat, according to the World Health Organization. The World Cancer Report, produced by the WHO's specialized cancer agency and released on World Cancer Day, predicts new cancer cases will rise from an estimated 14 million annually in 2012 to 22 million within two decades. Over the same period, cancer deaths are predicted to rise from 8.2 million a year to 13 million. The rising incidence of cancer, brought about chiefly by growing, aging populations worldwide, will require a heavier focus on preventive public health policies, said Christopher Wild, director of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. ""We cannot treat our way out of the cancer problem,"" he said. ""More commitment to prevention and early detection is desperately needed in order to complement improved treatments and address the alarming rise in cancer burden globally."" The report notes that the rocketing cost of responding to the ""cancer burden"" -- in 2010, the economic cost of the disease worldwide was estimated at $1.16 trillion -- is hurting the economies of rich countries and beyond the means of poor ones. The report said about half of all cancers were preventable and could have been avoided if current medical knowledge was acted upon. The disease could be tackled by addressing lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, diet and exercise; adopting screening programs; or, in the case of infection-triggered cancers such as cervical and liver cancers, through vaccines. ""I know the report said we can't treat our way out of (the cancer problem) but there are major things we can do,"" said Dr. David Decker who works in oncology at Florida Hospital in Orlando. ""Virtually 80 or 90 percent of lung cancers are caused by smoking. I know stopping smoking is not easy for people, but it does seem like a pretty simple way to reduce the numbers."" ""The cancer rates are not going up for shocking reasons, but for reasons that are easier to understand, and if we improve overall health, there are things we can do to prevent this from happening,"" Decker said. Cutting smoking rates would have a significant impact, as lung cancer remained the most commonly diagnosed cancer (1.8 million cases a year, or 13% of total cancer diagnoses) and the deadliest, accounting for about one-fifth (1.6 million) of all cancer deaths worldwide. There is a silver lining to the report, some experts said: It may lend urgency to the fight against cancer. Countries such as the United States present examples of success stories stemming from legislation and financial resources devoted to cancer prevention. ""The good news is, in (the United States), cancer mortality is trending downward, and that would be more true if you make an age adjustment,"" said Dr. Walter Curran, chairman of the Department of Radiation Oncology at Emory University's School of Medicine in Atlanta. ""Since we have an aging population, the cancer rate increases, and if you adjust for the aging of America, the cancer rate is declining notably."" Curran said a typical 20-year-old American who doesn't smoke, ""who has a good diet and a healthy lifestyle, someone with moderate alcohol consumption and who takes preventive health measures like regularly seeing a doctor and getting exercise -- their chance of cancer is significantly less than someone who for example lives in a developing country in Africa right now."" However, the United States is dealing with an obesity epidemic -- the rates of adults who are considered obese has doubled since the 1970s -- and drinking excessively is still the No.3 cause of lifestyle-related death. Smoking is still the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. However, when the U.S. Surgeon General linked tobacco to lung cancer 50 years ago, more than 40% of the adult population smoked; now it's about 19%. Public health initiatives have also made a difference in smoking rates. The report eventually spurred local governments to make it harder for a smoker to find a place to practice their habit. Many restaurants, bars, and even public parks ban smoking. National leadership gave state governments license to raise taxes on cigarettes so much that people quit because they could no longer afford their habit. Money from the federal tobacco lawsuit settlement went into smoking cessation programs and gave farmers incentives to grow crops other than tobacco. The FCC banned persuasive cigarette ads that may have encouraged young people to smoke. Smoking rates remain high in Asia and Africa. China -- where one-third of the world's cigarettes are smoked, according to the World Health Organization -- only recently moved to ban indoor public smoking. The report's authors suggested governments take similar legislative approaches to those they had taken against tobacco in attempting to reduce consumption of alcohol and sugary drinks, and in limiting exposure to occupational and environmental carcinogens, including air pollution. According to the report, the next two most common diagnoses were for breast (1.7 million, 11.9%) and large bowel cancer (1.4 million, 9.7%). Liver (800,000 or 9.1%) and stomach cancer (700,000 or 8.8%) were responsible for the most deaths after lung cancer. ""The rise of cancer worldwide is a major obstacle to human development and well-being,"" said Wild, the International Agency for Research on Cancer director. ""These new figures and projections send a strong signal that immediate action is needed to confront this human disaster, which touches every community worldwide."" The report said the growing cancer burden would disproportionately hit developing countries -- which had the least resources to deal with the problem -- due to their populations growing, living longer and becoming increasingly susceptible to cancers associated with industrialized lifestyles. More than 60% of the world's cases and about 70% of the world's cancer deaths occurred in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America. ""In the developing world, we are really at the beginning of understanding how serious the cancer problem is in these countries,"" said Emory School of Medicine's Curran. Cancers related to the HIV epidemic in developing countries and the spread of Hepatitis C are also on the rise, but so too is the general age of the population in developing counties. When you now have the potential to live long enough to see your grandchildren -- something that was not true even a decade ago in many developing countries -- your risk of having cancer is going to go up. ""When life expectancy get better, cancer rates will go up and so will cancer fatalities,"" Curran said. Governments needed to appreciate that screening and early detection programs were ""an investment rather than a cost,"" said Bernard Stewart, co-editor of the report -- and low-tech approaches had proven successful in some developing countries. The World Cancer Report, which is published about once every five years, involved a collaboration of around 250 scientists from more than 40 countries. Tuesday is World Cancer Day.","Cancer is preventable, if resources are dedicated to fighting it, experts say .
New cases of cancer are tipped to rise 57% worldwide in 20 years, says the WHO .

"(CNN)Attacks on press freedom traditionally provoke a strong response from newspaper editors around the world, and Wednesday's horrific attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo was no exception. As French police hunted for two suspects still on the run, headlines in Thursday's printed press reported the shooting with a potent mix of defiance and grief. French daily Libération ran a black front page with the words in bold white: ""Nous Sommes Tous Charlie"" -- ""We are all Charlie,"" echoing the crowds that took to the streets of Paris and other major cities to denounce the attack. L'Equipe, a French daily covering sports, ran a full-page cartoon showing stunned and teary sports fans with the headline ""Liberté 0 - Barbarie 12,"" alluding to the 12 people -- 10 journalists and two police officers -- who were killed in the assault. Le Figaro was one of a number of newspapers that printed an image showing the gunmen at the scene. Its headline declared ""La liberté assassinée,"" or ""freedom assassinated."" In a strongly worded column, the paper's editorial director, Alexis Brézet, called for a vigorous defense to the threats to press freedom, accusing the gunmen of striking at the heart of free expression. Le Télégramme's front page branded the word ""assassinés"" across the names of the magazine and the known victims, the magazine's leading cartoonists and editors who were gunned down during a morning meeting. The front page of Germany's Bild called it a ""cowardly murder."" In the United Kingdom, The Telegraph said the attack was a ""War on Freedom,"" while The Guardian called it ""An assault on democracy."" An accompanying editorial in The Guardian said the events were ""beyond belief, indeed beyond words."" ""The hooded thugs trained their Kalashnikovs on free speech everywhere. If they are allowed to force a loss of nerve, conversation will become inhibited, and liberty of thought itself will falter too."" The Times of London ran a front-page image of the shocking moment that one gunman pointed his weapon at a wounded police officer lying on the ground, with the words, ""Do you want to kill me?"" The headline ran ""Attack on Freedom."" The choice of photo attracted fierce criticism on social media with users condemning it as ""way too graphic"" and ""highly disrespectful."" One user tweeted, ""Why show the one image they want you to print, and not the cartoons?"" The Independent took a different tack, running a full-page image of a bloodied cover of Charlie Hebdo, with a hand emerging showing a raised middle finger. The yellow hand was holding a nib dripping with red ink. Fittingly, there were no words. In the United States, an editorial in The New York Times praised French President Francois Hollande for his appeal for national unity. This is ""no time for peddlers of xenophobia to try to smear all Muslims with a terrorist brush."" An opinion piece in The Washington Post draws a link to the recent cyberattack against Sony, saying ""Suddenly, satire is the great issue of our time."" Cartoonists, it says, ""take big risks, bigger than perhaps even they realize or anticipate,"" and Western democracies must ""rally to their unequivocal defense."" Danish daily broadsheet Politiken also chose to lead with a drawing: a simple image of a pencil that appears to break while drawing a line, which paused ... then continued on. In Germany, national daily Das Bild ran a front-page image of one of the gunmen shooting a police officer on the ground. ""Cowardly murderer,"" said the headline. The paper also has a piece quoting Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, known for his controversial depictions of the Prophet Mohammed, in which he insists that despite the fear many journalists feel, himself included, they must continue to use satire. The front page of Belgium's De Standaard reproduces a 2011 Charlie Hebdo cartoon of two men kissing deeply, one who appears to be Muslim and the other wearing a Charlie Hebdo T-shirt with a pencil behind his ear. ""Love is stronger than hate,"" is written above it in French. Haaretz didn't share that sentiment. ""I'm afraid the bad guys have already won. No cartoonist or publisher anywhere would dare start up with them now,"" said a headline on the English edition of the Israeli newspaper. The Gulf News, published in the United Arab Emirates, ran the story on its front page with a picture of a survivor being carried away on a stretcher and a box titled ""UAE solidarity -- raid condemned."" An editorial says the attackers ""violated all human principles and ethical values and deserve to be caught and tried for their disgusting acts,"" and their actions had ""nothing to do with Islam."" Charlie Hebdo had published cartoons of Mohammed ""that were certainly offensive to many Muslims,"" it said. ""But that is no reason to kill anyone, nor to commit any such act of gross violence."" The English-language Kuwait Times also had a front-page picture of one of the injured being carried away on a stretcher. The Arab Times, also published in Kuwait, ran that image and two others showing the police response. A headline in red ink read: ""Worst terrorist attack on French soil condemned."" India's Telegraph newspaper, published in Calcutta, ran the headline ""Bullet through a tradition"" next to an image of a bullet hole in a window near the attack scene. The story also made the front page of the New Indian Express and Pakistan's Dawn newspaper.","Thursday's newspapers around the world led with the Paris shooting .
Many reported the assault as an attack on freedom and free speech .
Many papers ran front-page cartoons as a tribute to the artists killed in the attack ."
"(CNN) -- As a frequent flier I have a laundry list of complaints about the process of flying, and that list has just been made longer by the Transportation Security Administration. My biggest complaints used to include flight staff who don't enforce carry-on restrictions and the people who stow their enormous carry-on baggage sideways. But these pale in comparison to the TSA's new measures. These represent another episode in the pointless frustration show that the TSA puts on to make us feel as though we're safe. This month the TSA introduced full-body scans that are little more than the realization of the back-of-the-comic-book fantasy of X-ray specs. These new full-body scans will do nothing for our security, nor will the invasive pat downs that will be waiting for those who refuse the scans. Opinion: What if we had no air security checks . Even before the backscatter X-ray machines roll out to all the airports in America (they are in 70 airports so far), I am actively looking for people to make a bet with me about the future of these machines. Specifically, I will bet that we will catch more TSA employees guilty of inappropriately forwarding full-body scans of celebrities or attractive women than we will terrorists. Additionally, I think I speak for all travelers when I wonder why we have full-body scans, yet will still have to put our shoes through the X-ray machine. If the TSA is going to have an X-ray photo of my private parts, I would hope that this sacrifice of personal freedom would at least allow me the luxury of wearing my shoes through the metal detector. Ultimately, the truth is that the TSA has done little or nothing to keep our skies safer than they were before 9/11. A quick look back at recent history reveals that in the years since 9/11 our best anti-terrorism efforts have come from brave, average civilians on flights. The shoe bomber and the Christmas bomber were both brought down by average citizens, not the TSA or their ridiculous policies. I understand that the TSA is not implementing these measures to punish fliers, but rather doing everything in its power to prevent a terrorist attack on an airplane. I commend their mission, but I do not commend the directions they are taking to achieve it. Sadly, the TSA is engaged in the same game as the World Anti-Doping Agency -- that is trying to solve a problem retroactively. The frightening truth is that the people who use drugs in sports and the terrorists intent on destruction will always be one step ahead of the slow, bureaucratic agencies in charge of policing them. The doping agency can't test for a steroid until it knows it exists. In much the same way, the TSA cannot adequately respond to a terrorist threat until it knows it exists. Sadly, the only way to know it exists is when someone fails in his attempt to do damage. More opinion on topics in the news . For example, the TSA allows us 3 ounces of liquid on a domestic flight. So, presumably, if terrorists wanted to get, say, 12 ounces of dangerous liquid through security, they would have to go through the difficult process of booking four tickets. These measures are ultimately nothing more than a show to make us feel more secure. The truth is that the security of flights will be determined by the level of competency of our intelligence services and the bravery of average Americans, not by a silly scan and a ban on water bottles. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christian Lander.","Christian Lander says new TSA measures make his other flying complaints pale by comparison .
He says they won't work; besides, post-9/11 terror tries were thwarted by passengers .
TSA strategy similar to sports anti-doping: tries to solve a problem retroactively .
Lander: Security depends on competence of intelligence services, average Americans ."
"Former President Jimmy Carter lauded the decision to normalize diplomatic relations with and ease sanctions imposed on Cuba, steps he said would benefit the Cuban people and not the country's autocratic rulers. Carter said President Barack Obama's decision to change the dynamic of the U.S.-Cuba relationship ""very wise and courageous"" and said he hopes Congress will move to end the embargo on Cuba. ""I think this is a good move, for both Cubans and Americans. I think it will be a major step forward to bring about more freedom and democracy and more respect for human rights in Cuba as well."" Carter said Wednesday on CNN. ""It's long overdue."" Related: Historic thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations . Obama settled a landmark deal to normalize relations between the two countries in a phone call with Cuban President Raul Castro this week. The call between the two leaders capped more than a year of secret discussions to secure the release of American aid worker Alan Gross. Obama released three convicted Cuban spies, but secured the release of 53 political prisoners held in Cuba, a Cuban national who spied for the U.S. and won concessions from Castro to free up Internet access in Cuba. Carter jumped to Obama's defense following a chorus of attacks from Republicans led by Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida who say Obama's decision amounted to appeasement of a totalitarian government that will lead to anything but democratization. Related: 2016 Republicans slam Cuba announcement . ""It is a lifeline for the Castro regime that will allow them to become more profitable ... and allow them to become a more permanent fixture,"" Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said Wednesday on CNN. ""The embargo is leverage, these sanctions are leverage."" Carter, who has traveled to Cuba several times and met with both Fidel and Raul Castro, called Rubio's comments ""absolutely ridiculous."" ""[The embargo] doesn't hurt the Castro brothers, it just hurts the people of Cuba -- about 11 million of them -- who have had to suffer because of our own imposed economic sanctions,"" Carter said. Related: American Alan Gross freed by Cuba . Carter added that Obama's decisions to ease the trade embargo -- which will include allowing the export of telecommunications equipment to Cuba and more travel authorizations to the country -- will help open up Cuban society and foster democracy. And Carter added that Americans could also benefit if the embargo is lifted. ""We're the only ones that can't go to Cuba,"" Carter said, referencing the ban preventing Americans from going to Cuba as tourists.","Former President Jimmy Carter has been critical of President Obama's foreign policy in the past .

"(CNN)Ohio is changing the drugs used in lethal injections, a move that will delay at least one execution scheduled for next month, the Ohio Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said Thursday. The state will stop using the two-drug regimen of midazolam and hydromorphone, the department said in a press release. The drug combination was last used in January 2014 on convicted murderer Dennis McGuire. Witnesses said he convulsed and gasped about 10 minutes before he died. The McGuire execution was closely watched because midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, had never been used in a U.S. execution. Ohio, like many states, was forced to find new execution drugs after European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions -- among them, Danish-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital. Ohio will add thiopental sodium, a drug the state used for lethal injections from 1999-2011, the department said. Thiopental sodium and pentobarbital will be the only drugs used. JoEllen Smith, spokesman for the corrections department, confirmed that Ohio has 40 vials of midazolam set to expire April 1. The release said the the February 11 execution of Ronald Phillips, and possibly others, will be postponed while Ohio secures a supply of pentobarbital and thiopental sodium. CNN is trying to reach Ohio officials for details about their decision. McGuire was convicted in 1994 of the rape and murder of 22-year-old Joy Stewart, who was seven months pregnant. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Ohio will stop using midazolam and hydromorphone and start using thiopental sodium .

"(CNN) -- An armed Christian organization which had pledged to protect a Florida church as it holds ""International Burn a Quran Day"" withdrew its support from the event Wednesday, saying it ""does not glorify God,"" according to a posting on its website. Right Wing Extreme, which describes itself as a Christian conservative group, also said in the posting it is asking the Dove World Outreach Center, based in Gainesville, Florida, not to hold the event ""for the reason that it may diminish the work of the Holy Spirit to witness to Muslims."" The event is planned for the ninth anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks. While the group agrees with the Dove Center's stance on Islam, press coverage of recent events, such as ""Burn a Quran Day,"" a recent ""Everybody Draw Mohammed Day"" group on Facebook and the controversy surrounding a proposed mosque and Islam community center near ground zero in New York is ""really inciting a lot of hatred and a lot of violence that's going on,"" Right Wing Extreme founder Shannon Carson told CNN. ""We don't want to be a part of inciting violence and racism anymore."" The group's website posting said it believes the ""liberal media"" is intentionally using such stories ""to distract, divide and enrage the public."" Carson said he had not yet spoken to Dove World Outreach Center Pastor Terry Jones, but plans to sometime Wednesday. Contacted by CNN, the Dove Center said it was unaware of the development. ""Of course, we are very surprised, and of course disappointed,"" Jones said. ""I talked to (Carson) personally and he was very excited about the stand that we had taken against Islam. He had already reviewed a lot of our information, YouTube (videos) -- he was 100 percent supportive in what we were doing."" Carson said since pledging its support and saying it would provide protection for the Dove Center, ""we've all received several death threats"" from the United States and beyond. The group has been in contact with the FBI, he said. Carson said he believes other groups may follow Right Wing Extreme and withdraw their support from the event as well. He said he will ask the Dove Center not to hold the event, but does not know whether they will proceed. ""We're not against them, we're just pulling our support,"" he said. Jones pointed out that Right Wing Extreme had contacted the Dove Center to offer its help along with financial support, not vice versa. ""There was at that time absolutely no indication that they were not supportive,"" Jones said. ""I can only come to the conclusion -- it seems very, very obvious -- they ... have bowed to fear or to pressure from other organizations, other groups."" He said the group has taken the easy way out by saying ""God would not do this."" But, Jones said, that's not the point of the event. ""This is sending a clear warning to radical Islam that they are not welcome in America."" He said the church will proceed with the event. Jones told CNN in an e-mail on Tuesday he had accepted the support of Right Wing Extreme, which he said offered to come to the church with between 500 and 2,000 men. Jones described the organization as an armed civilian militia group. ""There is a need for this protection,"" Jones wrote in an e-mail. ""It is absolutely necessary in light of the death and terror threats we have received. We have met with the FBI who have warned us of the threats they have seen, not only against us but against other targets in Florida. We have personally received threats by phone and many by mail."" Right Wing Extreme said in its Web posting Wednesday, ""Dove World Outreach are our brothers and sisters in Christ. However, we ask that they not hold this event for the reason that it may diminish the work of the Holy Spirit to witness to Muslims. ""America is a nation founded on the Bible,"" it said. ""Capitalism, our form of government, our laws and our freedoms come directly from the Bible. Sharia law, however is based not on freedom, but totalitarianism."" The system oppresses women and freedom of speech, along with ""basic rights that Americans have fought and died for,"" the group said. But, Carson noted Wednesday, ""We need to calm down here ... the whole violence thing, this is going to get real ugly real quick if this keeps stewing."" On Tuesday, Carson said in a statement sent to CNN by the Dove Center that ""We fully support Dove World Outreach Center and its efforts to put an end to the notion that Islam is a peaceful religion. Islam is a violent cult with the goal of world domination."" He repeated that on Wednesday. ""It's not that we don't agree with Dove's stance on Islam, because we believe it's not a religion, but a cult. We do have freedom of religion but when it is a violent religion, or cult, as Islam is, that is invading our nation, we don't support that,"" he said. Carson said he has spoken with Jones and his staff on the issue previously. Carson said Right Wing Extreme is opposed to the plan to build the mosque and Islamic community center near the site of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, saying it's ""spitting in the face"" of the 9/11 families. Jones said freedom of religion in American means ""Muslims are more than free to worship here, which is not the case in sharia law-dominated countries. They only have to respect and obey the Constitution"" and not force sharia law on others, he said. ""This is just a typical giving in to pressure and fear,"" he said of Right Wing Extreme's withdrawal. Muslims and many other Christians, including some evangelicals, are fighting the church's plan to burn the Quran. Religious leaders in Gainesville have planned an event billed as a ""Gathering for Peace, Understanding and Hope"" on September 10 as a response to the church's proposal. The Islamic advocacy group Council on American-Islamic Relations has called on Muslims and others to host ""Share the Quran"" dinners to educate the public. In a statement, the group has said it will give out 100,000 copies of the Quran to local, state and national leaders.","NEW: Church says it is surprised by the development .

"(CNN)Some recent visitors to Disneyland left the fabled theme park with a souvenir they won't soon forget: measles. Public health officials in California and Utah confirmed nine cases Wednesday, all of them visitors of either Disneyland or Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim between December 15 and December 20. The California Department of Public Health said it suspects an additional three cases but had not yet confirmed those diagnoses. According to the CDC, measles is respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air.  It was considered eradicated in the United States in 2000, though 2014 saw a record-breaking number of confirmed cases: 610 according to the Centers for Disease Control, ""the highest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000,"" the CDC says on its website. Nevertheless, California health officials speculate that since Disneyland attracts visitors from around the world -- including places where the highly contagious disease is prevalent -- that was likely the case here. ""Travelers to areas where measles is endemic can bring measles back to the U.S., resulting in limited domestic transmission of measles,"" read a statement from California Department of Public Health. ""Disney and other theme parks in California are international attractions and visitors come from many parts of the world, including those where measles is endemic."" Dr. Pamela Hymel, Disney's chief medical officer, issued a brief statement: ""We are working with the health department to provide any information and assistance we can."" As for symptoms, ""measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat,"" according to the CDC. Those showing such symptoms shouldn't be bashful about seeing their doctor, because a full body rash is likely to break out next.  ""If you have symptoms, and believe you may have been exposed, please contact your health care provider,"" said Dr. Ron Chapman, California's state health office. Chapman says prevention is the key: ""The best way to prevent measles and its spread is to get vaccinated."" 5 things to know about measles .","Nine visitors to Disneyland or Disney California Adventure Park have been infected with measles .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Although the United States narrowly avoided an unprecedented default following congressional approval of a last-minute compromise plan to raise the debt ceiling, China's leading credit rating agency Wednesday downgraded U.S. sovereign debt after putting it on negative watch last month. The Dagong Global Credit Rating Company, which lowered the United States to A+ last November after the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to continue loosening its monetary policy, announced a further downgrade to A, indicating heightened doubts over Washington's long-term ability to repay its debts. It said the gloomy assessment -- much lower than the AAA ratings given by the so-called ""big three"" Western agencies Moody's, Fitch, and Standard and Poor's -- was inevitable given the level of market concern generated by the stalemate between Democrats and Republicans over the debt ceiling. ""The squabbling between the two political parties on raising the U.S. debt ceiling reflected an irreversible trend on the United States' declining ability to repay its debts,"" Dagong Chairman Guan Jianzhong told CNN. ""The two parties acted in a very irresponsible way and their actions greatly exposed the negative impact of the U.S. political system on its economic fundamentals,"" he said. Ironically, Dagong's move could hurt not just the United States but also China, the largest foreign owner of U.S. debt with holdings worth almost $1.2 trillion. ""Our downgrade simply reflects reality,"" Guan said. ""Our rating didn't cause China to lose any money --- it was the inappropriately high ratings for the U.S. by Western agencies that had led China to make risky investments in U.S. debt."" Observers say China, whose foreign exchange reserves now stand at $3.2 trillion, has had little choice but to buy U.S. Treasury bonds. ""There aren't that many other markets that are as deep or as liquid as treasuries,"" said Patrick Chovanec, an economic analyst with Tsinghua University in Beijing. ""When they accumulate reserves, this is the only place they can put them."" The privately held Dagong, founded in 1994 to rate Chinese companies, attracted worldwide attention last July when it published its first sovereign credit ratings and, citing growing deficits in the developed world, ranked China higher than the United States and Japan. Dagong now rates 67 countries and aims to more than double the number by the end of this year. Its ambition to become an alternative to the ""big three"" suffered a setback, however, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission refused to recognize its rating because of the commission's inability to supervise the Beijing-based agency. Guan, who worked as a civil servant and a Wall Street accountant before taking the helm at Dagong, is quick to defend his firm's independence and objectivity. He points to what he calls Western agencies' ""double standard"" in rating the U.S. and European economies to underscore the global need for a newcomer like Dagong. ""People are used to credit ratings issued by the 'big three,' but the financial crisis has clearly proved them wrong,"" Guan said. ""They can no longer shoulder the responsibility of rating the world."" ""That's the role we are striving to play,"" he added.","Grade of A is much lower than those of ""big three"" Western agencies .

"(CNN)""Selma,"" the new feature film about the civil rights struggle, is igniting a struggle of its own over who deserves credit -- or blame -- in the events of 50 years ago that are depicted in the movie. Some have taken issue with the portrayal of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Former LBJ administration officials are crying foul, saying that the portrayal of Johnson distorts and tarnishes the record of a man who had become an ally in the fight, committed to the goal and focused on how best to achieve the goal -- given the role of Congress and outside forces. Johnson's legacy has long been overshadowed by the quagmire of the Vietnam War, and his supporters hope to burnish the image of his presidency by highlighting his efforts in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It's the struggle for the latter that is portrayed in ""Selma."" But the movie shows Johnson as worried that the fight for voting rights will endanger the chances of success for other items on his Great Society agenda, and he pressures the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to wait. When King is adamant, the film implies that Johnson even allows J. Edgar Hoover's FBI to pressure the civil rights leader by sending his wife, Coretta Scott King, supposed audio recordings of King having sex with another woman. Even before the movie was in wide release, LBJ Presidential Library Director Mark Updegrove, writing in Politico, said, "" 'Selma's' obstructionist LBJ is devoid of any palpable conviction on voting rights. Vainglorious and power hungry, he unleashes his zealous pit bull, FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover, on King."" Updegrove claims the movie ""flies in the face of history."" Writing in The Washington Post, Joseph A. Califano Jr., one of Johnson's top aides, accuses the movie of using ""dramatic, trumped-up license."" ""In fact,"" he adds, ""Selma was LBJ's idea, he considered the Voting Rights Act his greatest legislative achievement, he viewed King as an essential partner in getting it enacted -- and he didn't use the FBI to disparage him."" ""Selma"" director Ava DuVernay responded to the criticism on Twitter, posting that the ""Notion that Selma was LBJ's idea is jaw dropping and offensive to SNCC, SCLC and black citizens who made it so"" (in a reference to the civil rights organizations Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference.) In a subsequent tweet she told people not to take anyone's word for it, but that ""Bottom line is folks should interrogate history."" Of course, once you start interrogating history, you rarely get simple answers. The actions and motivations of real people in real historical events are complicated and ambiguous. Once you take those real people and events and put them into a movie -- even one that strives for historic accuracy -- you add even more complications and ambiguity. It's not possible to re-create, or even agree on, exactly what happened in the past. If those who forget the past are condemned to relive it, it seems that those who re-enact the past are condemned to revise it. Julian Zelizer: The real story behind 'Selma' Johnson may be portrayed as flawed, but he's certainly not the villain of the movie -- Alabama in 1965 had villains aplenty. Johnson is shown as a man with ambitious goals and strong-arm methods, and a cold pragmatism when it came to deciding what could be done when. It could be argued that -- like King -- LBJ is keeping his ""eyes on the prize,"" and he's not concerned if he tramples a few toes while he's transfixed with the goal. He's a politician, not a saint, and he concentrates more on what's most doable than what's most noble. He's not above using the N-word in a private conversation with Alabama Gov. George Wallace, but he uses it while trying to get Wallace to offer protection to King's marchers. Johnson may ultimately be on the side of the angels, but he's willing to use devilry to achieve his goals. Like any great movie character -- or real human being -- he is complicated and multifaceted. In one of the scenes that has caused the most controversy, when King is urging a reluctant LBJ at the White House, they do it in front of a portrait of George Washington -- a subtle reminder of how long we have been discussing race in America. If the LBJ of ""Selma"" is shown as imperfect, he's not alone. The leaders in the many factions of the civil rights movement are shown as fractious, jealous of their prerogatives and at times petty. Even King's shortcomings are on display, as it's implied that the accusations of infidelities against him may be true. At one point, King, doubtful about his next move, is shown calling up gospel singer Mahalia Jackson for inspiration. Jackson was a strong supporter of the movement. In fact, King had called her to come down to Alabama during the Montgomery bus boycott. The very fact that we are dealing with real human beings and not abstractions is what makes their struggle seem even more impressive. Andrew Young: The miracle of Selma . ""Selma"" is a movie, not a documentary. It neither claims nor tries to give a 100% accurate telling of the story -- or the events that led to this seminal moment in the civil rights struggles in the 1960s. Director DuVernay was even forced to rewrite the speeches of King used in the movie as loose paraphrases because his estate licensed his speeches to another studio for a different movie. As in any work of art, in this movie choices have to be made in what to portray and in how to portray it. The goal of art is to arrive at fundamental truths that do not rely on the details of incidents being portrayed for their relevance. And if a work of art is successful in that, it will illuminate the events in ways that transcend the time and place being portrayed, and transcend the time and place of the work of art itself. One of the choices made in the making of ""Selma"" is to keep the focus on the marchers and the people who were putting their lives and safety on the line. Part of that focus may be because the director is an African-American woman. She may be trying to avoid the often annoying tendency of movies dealing with important events in African-American history to concentrate on white protagonists. Films such as ""Glory"" and ""Mississippi Burning"" sometimes treat the African-Americans whose stories are being told like they are passive agents in a narrative that depends on a white hero riding in to save the day, presumably on a white horse. The portrayals in ""Selma"" shouldn't be seen as a dismissal of Johnson's contributions to the fight civil rights, but as an affirmation of the struggles of the people who were in the middle of that fight, and who had vowed not to fight back with violence. It's a case of keeping your eyes not only on the prize, but on the proper protagonists. Something else that may be at work here is that we are currently embroiled in another clash in the long, long struggle for equal rights with the ongoing protests over treatment of African-Americans under the justice system. It's impossible to see the images of peaceful protesters being brutally attacked on the bridge in ""Selma"" without being reminded of the images of Eric Garner being dragged to the ground in a chokehold. But both the protests today and the events depicted in the movie show that we need commitment and cooperation from good-hearted people of all races and creeds. At the end of the movie, viewers are updated on the subsequent fates of the people portrayed in the film, many of which we know all too well. I just wish that they had given an update on the fate of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That postscript would have to say something like ""The Voting Rights Act of 1965 led a successful and productive life until 2013 when key provisions in it were struck down by the Supreme Court. It is currently on life support."" That would alert viewers to the need to continue the fight. Is ""Selma"" a note-perfect recreation of everything that happened regarding the struggles in passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965? No, because it's not meant to be. It's meant to be something much more, and at that it succeeds. After watching the movie ""Selma,"" I can't say I was at Selma. And I can't say I know what it must have felt like to be there. But I experienced a visceral reaction to a depiction of those events that inspired me, that motivated me ... and that made me want to march on as we continue the struggle for universal suffrage.","Donna Brazile: ""Selma"" has stirred a controversy over its historical accuracy .
She says critics miss the point; movie isn't a documentary, but it has a powerful message ."
"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be hiding close to each other in houses in northwest Pakistan, but are not together, a senior NATO official said. ""Nobody in al Qaeda is living in a cave,"" said the official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the intelligence matters involved. Rather, al Qaeda's top leadership is believed to be living in relative comfort, protected by locals and some members of the Pakistani intelligence services, the official said. Pakistan has repeatedly denied protecting members of the al Qaeda leadership. The official said the general region where bin Laden is likely to have moved around in recent years ranges from the mountainous Chitral area in the far northwest near the Chinese border, to the Kurram Valley, which adjoins Afghanistan's Tora Bora, one of the Taliban strongholds during the U.S. invasion in 2001. Tora Bora is also the region from which bin Laden is believed to have escaped during a U.S. bombing raid in late 2001. U.S. officials have long said there have been no confirmed sightings of bin Laden or Zawahiri for several years. The area that the official described covers hundreds of square miles of some of the most rugged terrain in Pakistan, inhabited by fiercely independent tribes. The official also confirmed the U.S. assessment that Mullah Omar, the leader of the Taliban, has moved between the cities of Quetta and Karachi in Pakistan over the last several months. The official would not discuss how the coalition has come to know any of this information, but he has access to some of the most sensitive information in the NATO alliance. Analysis: The finger is being pointed at Pakistan . However, Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan, said there was nothing new to what the official was saying. ""We hardly have a day that goes by where somebody doesn't say they know where Osama bin Laden is,"" said Holbrooke, who was in Rome, Italy, for a conference on Afghanistan. Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the exact locations for bin Laden and Zawahiri are unknown, other than that they are ""somewhere in the tribal areas of Pakistan near the Afghanistan border."" ""If we knew where he was -- in a house, an apartment, a villa or an underground cave or bunker -- we would have gotten him,"" said the official. ""We can't rule out he may be in a cave one day and a house in a city on another."" The official referred to CIA Director Leon Panetta's comment a few months ago that the United States has not had any precise information about bin Laden's whereabouts for many years. ""He is, as is obvious, in very deep hiding,"" Panetta said. ""He's in an area of the tribal areas of Pakistan that is very difficult."" As for Pakistan's role, Holbrooke said it was ultimately up to Islamabad to decide how to craft its fight against militants. ""The United States and our allies -- all would encourage them to do as much as they are able to do,"" Holbrooke said. ""There's been a long discussion about whether ... they would go into other parts of the border area. That is for them to decide on the basis of their resources."" Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik said Monday that similar reports of bin Laden and Mullah Omar's whereabouts have proven false in the past. Malik denied the two men are on Pakistani soil, but said that any information to the contrary should be shared with Pakistani officials so that they can take ""immediate action"" to arrest the pair. The NATO official, who has day-to-day senior responsibilities for the war, offered a potentially grimmer view than what has been publicly offered by others. ""Every year the insurgency can generate more and more manpower,"" despite coalition military attacks, he said. Although there has been security progress in areas where coalition forces are stationed, he said in other areas, ""we don't know what's going on."" He pointed to an internal assessment that there are 500,000 to 1 million ""disaffected"" men between the ages of 15 and 25 in the Afghan-Pakistan border region. Most are Afghan Pashtuns, and they make up some of the 95 percent of the insurgency who carry out attacks just to earn money, rather than to fight for a hard-core Taliban ideology, he said. The official said it is now absolutely vital for the Afghan government to address the needs of this group with security, economic development and jobs in order for the war to end and for Afghanistan to succeed. ""We are running out of time,"" he said. In recent days, Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, has made a number of public statements expressing some optimism about the progress of the war. Petraeus ""doesn't think time is running out, "" his spokesman, Rear Adm. Gregory Smith, told CNN. The NATO official said the entire scenario is made more complex by the fact that ""there is a huge criminal enterprise"" in Afghanistan, dealing in human, drug and mineral trafficking. Those crimes are also tied in to the insurgency. He acknowledged the overall strategy now is to increase offensive airstrikes and ground attacks in order to increase the pressure on the Taliban and insurgent groups to come to the negotiating table with the current Afghan government. There is a growing sense that many insurgent leaders may be willing to accept conditions such as renouncing al Qaeda because they want to come back to Afghanistan. But, the official cautioned, hard-core Taliban groups such as the Quetta Shura run by Mullah Omar, the Haqqanis, the HiG (Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin) and the Pakistani Taliban still could potentially muster as many as 30,000 fighters. The U.S. continues to face a more localized insurgency in the south. In places like Marja and the Helmand River Valley, the majority of the fighters captured are within a few miles of their homes. The insurgent leader Mullah Abdullah Zakir has increased his strength in the south, the official said. He essentially exerts some levels of control and influence both in the greater Kandahar region and across the south from Zabul to Farah province. The official continued to stress the urgency of getting the Afghan government to deal with the multitude of problems it faces. Right now, the U.S. war plan approved by President Barack Obama extends through 2014, the official said. That is the official document that spells out matters such as troop rotation schedules. The U.S. military could sustain a war ""'indefinitely,"" the official said. But the goal is to achieve reconciliation and allow the Afghan government to function and provide security and services to the people. Without that, he said, ""we will be fighting here forever.""

"Human remains discovered last weekend in Albemarle County, Virginia, belong to University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, authorities said Friday. Graham, 18, went missing before dawn on September 13 after being last spotted on several surveillance cameras in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall area. Authorities looking Graham found the remains last Saturday on an abandoned property eight miles from where the sophomore was last seen. Graham's parents, John and Sue, acknowledged the confirmation of the remains' identity, announced by the Virginia Medical Examiner's Office and the Albemarle County Police Department. ""When we started this journey together we all hoped for a happier ending,"" the couple said in a statement. ""Sadly that was not to be, but due to the tenacity and determination of (Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy) Longo, Hannah is coming home to us and we will be eternally grateful to him for this. ""We are devastated by the loss of our beautiful daughter,"" the parents added. Authorities are continuing their investigation, in which an abduction charge has been filed against one man. ""The focus of the investigation now is to determine what charges will be brought and the appropriate time to make those charges,"" according to a statement from the office of Albemarle County Commonweath's Attorney Denise Y. Lunsford. Her office declined to comment further. County police said they were moving ""forward with the death investigation."" ""Our focus is on the investigation and therefore, we will not be answering questions regarding the case or investigation. We do ask that people continue to call in with tips or information,"" a county police statement said. The downtown Charlottesville camera footage showed Graham leaving the Tempo Bar at around 2 a.m. on September 13, as well as a man -- later identified by authorities as Jesse Matthew, 32 -- following her. On September 24, Matthew was taken into custody while camping on a beach in Galveston, Texas, some 1,300 miles from Charlottesville. He is the only person detained in connection with Graham's disappearance, charged with abduction with the intent to defile. He has also been linked by forensic evidence to the case of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student who was last seen hitchhiking along U.S. 29 outside of Charlottesville in October 2009. She was found dead on a nearby farm the following January. No arrests have been made in Harrington's case, and the cause of her death still is under investigation. Police, though, did recently seize a cab owned by Matthew that he was driving in Charlottesville in 2009, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Matthew's next court appearance in relation to Graham's disappearance is scheduled for December 4. Matthew's father, Jesse Matthew Sr., has said that his son would not have harmed Graham. ""For a big man, he's as gentle as they come,"" Jesse Matthew Sr. told CNN affiliate WTVR. ""The only thing I could see, him, maybe trying to give the girl a ride or help her out. To kill or hurt somebody, that's not my son."" Matthew's Virginia-based lawyer, James Camblos, has declined to comment.

"(CNN)In the new Republican Congress, the first priority is a pipeline. Not jobs (not really). Not police violence (and anti-police violence). Not ISIS. It's a pipeline, the Keystone XL, which, as I'm sure you've heard, would carry crude from Canada across the United States and to the Gulf Coast, where some of it would be processed and exported. The Republican argument for the pipeline more or less fits in a single word: jobs. They cite a State Department report saying the pipeline would create 42,000 temporary jobs. But as the fact checkers at The Washington Post and elsewhere have pointed out, that's highly misleading at best. ""Most of those jobs are far from the construction site, and it's hard to argue they are new,"" writes Glenn Kessler. ""Moreover, under State's accounting, they only last for a year. For some workers, it would be a good but brief payday. In the context of the U.S. economy, the impact is barely a ripple."" The low-ball estimate: Only 35 permanent jobs would be created. Yep, 35. And crazy-low oil prices make the pipeline even less of an economic boon. Democrats and environmentalists, meanwhile, have started using the now-famous pipeline as a stand-in for climate change, a dangerously myopic proposition given the scope and seriousness of that issue. Build the pipeline and it means the United States is shirking on a cleaner-energy future. Oppose it, and that's a sign that this country -- long a laggard on stabilizing the climate -- is finally making amends. I've been to the Tar Sands region of Canada, where the Keystone crude would originate. I've watched machines with wheel axles high above my head dig for oil in the dirt -- a form of strip mining, really, where the environmental costs of continuing to use fossil fuels are visible in enormous, earthen pits. It does have literal and symbolic importance. It matters. But killing Keystone has become more about politics than substance. Plenty of other issues deserve that level of attention. Instead of going on griping about all of it though (this is a new year, after all, a time for aspirations and optimism), I'd like to suggest five environmental issues that I hope will become part of a more grounded national debate in 2015. If you have other ideas, please shoot me a note on Twitter (I'm @jdsutter) or in the comments section below. 1. Climate change . This is a no-brainer. The world will meet in Paris this December to attempt to hammer out a truly international agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions and stave off the very worst effects of climate change. Some worry it may be too little too late. But news out of 2014's pre-Paris talks was surprisingly hopeful -- and included, for the first time, the possibility of all countries joining a climate pact. The talks in December, writes Andrew Simms for The Guardian, are ""the most significant task ahead of us in 2015."" 2. Nature thieves . There's a massive black market for rare plants and animals -- and we could be living in a world without elephants, rhinos and pangolins (yes, pangolins) if we let the illegal extraction of natural resources continue. The World Wildlife Fund estimates the scale of the wildlife trade at $10 billion annually. African elephants -- massively smart creatures, and symbols of the amazing world we inhabit -- could go extinct in a matter of decades if the trade in their ivory tusks isn't stopped. Rhino poaching is also on the rise. Asia is a major market for these illicit goods. Rhino horn and pangolin scales are used in traditional medicines, for example, and other parts are sold as luxury goods. But the United States also is a significant consumer, too. 3. The soil . I tend to hate the ""Year of ____"" construct, but the United Nations was smart to declare 2015 the International Year of Soils. Soil isn't something most of us think much about, but it's crucial to our food system and the health of the natural environment. (""Interstellar,"" anyone?) ""The world will have over 9 billion people in 2050, 2 billion more than today,"" the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization's director-general, José Graziano da Silva, said in a prepared statement. ""And food production will have to grow by 60% to feed a larger population that will also be eating better. So there is no doubt the pressure on natural resources is bound to increase. And soils are not something we can simply fix if it breaks: It can take up to one thousand years to form one centimeter of topsoil."" 4. Water conservation . Water is the new oil, and industries and governments need to get smarter about protecting this vital resource from pollution and overuse. In California, a prolonged drought has pushed farmers to drill deeper water wells and pump the resource out of the ground. The earth literally is sinking in response, according to U.S. Geological Survey research. (Take a look at this photo.) And the fundamental problem is far from isolated. About 1.2 billion people live in water-scarce regions, according to the United Nations. In many places, climate change threatens to make droughts more severe. 5. Air pollution . Dealing with climate change also has a spinoff effect: It makes the air safer to breathe. Having fewer power plants is good on the lungs. If you're a person living in India or China (or Houston), that is undoubtedly welcome news. In 2012, outdoor air pollution was estimated to cause 3.7 million premature deaths. In China, the situation appears so dystopian that a businessman in Beijing was reportedly selling cans of clean air.","The Keystone XL pipeline is priority No. 1 for the Republican U.S. Congress .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- A strike by Italian truck drivers that has caused shortages of food, fuel and medicine across the country has ended -- at least for now. A spokesman for Italy's government told CNN the strike was called off after a Wednesday meeting between government and labor leaders in which the government made an offer to settle truckers' grievances. ""We can report that in the coming hours the country can return to complete normalcy,"" Enrico Letta, undersecretary for Prime Minister Romano Prodi, said in announcing the end of the strike. ""It was a difficult and complicated negotiation."" Representatives for labor unions represented in the strike, however, said the strike has merely been suspended. They said union leaders wanted to talk to members before accepting what was described as a ""take it or leave it"" offer from the government. Truckers are demanding more money to compensate for rising fuel prices, which in Italy is mostly a result of taxes. Truck drivers had defied a government order Wednesday to halt what they had said would be a five-day strike. Organizers of the strike, which began early Monday morning, said participation was massive, with 99 percent of trucking companies taking part. The strike was scheduled to last until midnight Friday. Already gas stations have been closed for lack of fuel, and supermarkets -- mostly those in large cities -- have shortages of produce and dairy goods. Trucks carrying fuel and medicines for hospitals and pharmacies have been let through, but pharmacists warned there could be shortages of medicine in the long run. Italy's Transport Ministry demanded the strikers return to work Wednesday because of ""damages to the community,"" but the truck drivers said they would continue striking. Pasquale Russo, head of Conftrasporto, the nation's largest association of trucking companies, said some unions agreed to the government's terms -- which have not yet been disclosed -- while others did not. He said some truckers remained unhappy Wednesday with the government's offer and had not returned to work. Some 150,000 trucking companies are taking part in the strike, leaving 600,000 trucks idle, according to Conftrasporto. The government released no figures. Highways are essential to Italian commerce, accounting for the transport of 84 percent of its goods. Conftrasporto calculated that if the strike were to continue for the full five days, the Italian economy would suffer damages of 2.5 billion euros ($3.7 billion). But the labor association defended the action by pointing out it would still supply hospitals, pharmacies, and emergency services. ""Of course we are sorry that we are creating some hardship, but if we don't do it this way, no one will take us seriously,"" said striking truck driver Massimiliano Antonini. International trucking routes are affected as well. British driver Brian Briggs, stuck since Tuesday, needed to deliver art to northern Italy and then head back to London. ""The company will lose money because they have to pay me for sitting here, doing nothing,"" Briggs said. The protest has mostly been peaceful, though police reported a few arrests of striking drivers beating those who refused to participate. E-mail to a friend .

"New York (CNN)France remains in mourning after attacks on magazine Charlie Hebdo and other targets, including a kosher grocery store, left 17 dead and more critically injured. Tributes have been pouring in to the victims, as well as messages of support for the magazine.  People everywhere took to social media to express solidarity. #charliehebdo circled the globe, along with #jesuischarlie translated into scores of different languages.  Such was the outpouring of support, Twitter confirmed #jesuischarlie had become one of the most popular hashtags in history. Also trending were hashtags #JeSuisJuif, #JeSuisAhmed and #JeSuisHumain; people looking to show solidarity with all the victims of the terror rampage, including the police officers who were shot while defending Hebdo's employees. At least 3.7 million people, joined by multiple world leaders, marched in anti terrorism rallies in Paris and elsewhere in France and around the world. Rallies and Vigils were held around the world; some participants holding pencils as a way to honor the fallen cartoonists, others held signs reading 'I am Charlie' in a variety of different languages including Hebrew. Sunday after the attacks, New York's Empire State Building lit up in the colors of the French flag, then went dark for 5 minutes to honor the memories of those killed. Maps showing planned events circulated online, while moments of silence and memorials were held. But there was also defiance, and vows to continue the legacy of those killed. Indeed the first edition of Hebdo to be published after the attacks sold out in just hours. Le Monde, along with Radio France and France Televisions, provided some resources to help the magazine stay afloat. Support came also from other sources, such as Google who pledged to donate 250,000 Euros from its Press Innovation Fund to support the print run, and the Guardian Media Group who pledged £100,000. A crowdfunding campaign called 'Solidarite Charlie' has so far raised over €100,000 for the magazine, as well as for the families of the victims of the attack, including the police. The Committee to Protect Journalists updated their site with profiles of some of those lost, and many took to Twitter to say they'd donated to CPJ in honor of Charlie Hebdo. The website for Charlie Hebdo itself is now offering ways to donate to the magazine.  'Freedom is the right of expression,' reads its' website; 'Charlie Hebdo needs you to survive.' Others expressed support by subscribing to the magazine. Satirists unite . Cartoonists everywhere took up pencils to express their solidarity with the victims. Many offered to donate cartoons to this week's issue of the magazine. The cover of the New Yorker magazine shows the Eiffel Tower as a pencil, in solidarity with the fallen cartoonists. Late night comedians also took to the air to express their support. ""Very few people go into comedy as an act of courage,"" said Jon Stewart, ""mainly because it shouldn't have to be that."" ""In this country we take it for granted that it's our right to poke fun at the untouchable and the sacred,"" said Conan, ""but today's tragedy in Paris reminds us very viscerally that it's a right some people are inexplicably forced to die for."" Coping with tragedy . ""I am in the same mood as the day of 911,"" one French bystander told CNN. Indeed the American Psychological Association explains that terrorism works by instilling a sense of helplessness. ""It seeks to hold a government or society hostage by fear of destruction and harm."" There are resources on their website to help those impacted by all-too-common attacks like the one on Charlie Hebdo. Yet around the world the message was largely one of defiance in the face of fear. A line from a blog by Matt Welch on Reason.com has been retweeted over a thousand times; ""Do you really wanna be Charlie Hebdo? Then get on out there, live and speak bravely.

"(CNN)Thirteen former United Airlines flight attendants say they were fired for refusing to work a commercial flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong after the airline discovered ""threatening"" words and ""menacing"" images drawn on the tail cone of the Boeing 747. The aircraft was being prepared for takeoff when flight attendants became aware oil from the aircraft's auxiliary engine was used to paint the words ""BYE BYE"" in 6-inch-high letters above two faces, ""one smiling and the other with a more troubling devilish expression,"" according to a federal complaint filed Wednesday with the Department of Labor. The flight attendants say that on July 14, United Airlines ignored a ""serious and credible threat to the security and safety of passengers by ordering them to fly in order to avoid cost and disruption to the airline's flight schedule and revenue,"" said David Marshall, the attorney representing the group. Also in the federal complaint, the flight attendants allege they informed the airline they were ""uncomfortable flying unless United took steps to address this security threat, including deplaning 300-plus passengers and conducting a thorough security inspection of the aircraft."" Marshall said they wanted to ""ensure that no explosive device had been planted in the plane."" United tells CNN the incident was investigated by its flight operations and safety teams. ""There was no credible security threat,"" the airline said in a statement. ""All of FAA's and United's own safety procedures were followed, including a comprehensive safety sweep prior to boarding, and the pilots, mechanics and safety leaders deemed the aircraft entirely safe to fly."" The airline said the pilots were willing to fly the plane. The flight attendants said in the ""wake of the disappearance of Malaysia Flight 370 and a warning issued by TSA about consumer electronic device bombs just a week earlier,"" they had a ""heightened duty and legal responsibility"" to do whatever was necessary  to make sure everyone onboard was safe. Grace Lam, one of the terminated flight attendants said, ""given the gravity of the risks involved -- the lives of passengers and crew alike -- we were not willing to bow to United's pressure to ignore an unresolved security threat."" The flight attendants were fired in October for insubordination. The federal complaint accuses United of bullying and retaliatory firings. The flight attendants want their jobs back, back pay and compensatory damages.","Flight attendants: Two faces and the words ""bye bye"" were painted on an airliner .

"With great power comes great responsibility. There is some confusion over whether this quote should be attributed to Voltaire or Spiderman. Either way, the message is the same and one that should be resonating with the inventors, companies, brands, media, policy makers and industries hitching a ride on the innovation bullet train of wearable technologies. Our original Human Cloud research project at Goldsmiths, University of London in partnership with cloud computing provider Rackspace focused on the socio-economic impact of wearable technology moving from novelty and entertainment to health and lifestyle. We conducted a survey of 4,000 adults in the UK and US and spent six weeks with 26 participants experimenting with these new technologies, from fitness bands like the Fitbit, Jawbone Up and Nike Fuelband, to sensor-based wearable cameras like the Autographer. With echoes of Stephen Hawking's voice on Radiohead's ""OK Computer"" album, participants experimenting with wearable technologies felt fitter (68%), happier (75%), and more productive (84%). The nuances of the human experience was reflected in the six archetypes of wearable technology users we identified from deep qualitative research from the curious, controllers, and quantified selfers to the self-medics, finish line fanatics, and ubiquitors. ""As you can see, today has not gone well so far,"" says one self-medic participant mournfully, looking at two graphs: one shows he only took 394 steps that day, the other that he only got five hours 28 minutes sleep. When asked why he wears technology, his answer is to ""prevent delusion"" and so that function is at least achieved. Privacy remains a key issue, but it is a multifaceted and complex discussion. Twenty percent of survey respondents wanted to see Google Glass banned entirely from public spaces, but the same percentage were willing to share the data from wearable devices with government to improve services. The argument from our 'controller' archetype is that their data is already valuable, the question is who is benefiting and exploiting this value. Fernando Pessoa wrote that it is the fate of everyone in this life to be exploited so is it worse to be exploited by Senhor Vasques [his employer] and his textile company than by vanity, glory, resentment, envy, or the impossible? This is a question all of us must answer, particularly as the fine line between the possible and the seemingly impossible is breached nearly every day by one form of emerging technology or another fueled by the exponential growth of computing power, storage, bandwidth, nanotechnology, and big data. One of the most intriguing findings of the initial phase of the research was the way early adopter companies were starting to explore the power of wearable tech in the workplace. Several companies reported issuing laptops, mobile phones, and fitness bands to all employees as part of standard corporate kit.  This stimulated our imagination and led to the next phase of our research now underway with Rackspace. We are looking at a big data mash-up where the wearable tech human cloud meets the productivity and performance corporate cloud to amplify the role of the human cloud at work. For businesses experimenting with these technologies there are implications for occupational psychology, systems development, insight and analytics, leadership, competitive advantage, environmental analysis and workplace design. Three billion gigabytes of big data are generated every day, but only one-half of one percent of this data gets analyzed and put to work. Wearable tech data from employees and customers are an inevitable key ingredient in the recipes for making sense of big data and the role of emerging technologies in shaping our cities, societies, markets and economies. This big data stew can be augmented with cognitive and decision-support systems like IBM Watson, the computing service that famously triumphed on Jeopardy in 2011, now deployed in the cloud diagnosing and helping treat cancer patients. With real-time access to human data in the workplace systems like Watson can potentially support specific decisions and scenarios in relation to your personal Human Cloud. We recognize it is not all about opportunities. There are obvious surveillance implications and risks inherent in these kinds of dynamic data driven integrations of networks of people and systems. Analysts at Credit Suisse suggest the wearable tech market will grow from $1.4bn (£878m) in annual sales this year to $50bn (£31.3bn) by 2018. Your friendly neighborhood Spiderman also said some spiders change colors to blend into their environment. It's a defense mechanism. Wearable technologies are in the midst of this blending and soon will diffuse subtly but powerfully into the fabric of everyday lives so as to be unrecognizable as a distinct innovation domain. At this stage it is the great responsibility of every one of us to consider those implications.","Human Cloud research project explores socio-economic impact of wearable tech .

"Two Indian sailors were found dead Thursday a day after the submarine they were on filled with toxic smoke, authorities said. The accident, the latest in a series of problems plaguing the Indian fleet, prompted the chief of the country's navy to resign. Seven crew members of the Russian-built submarine, the INS Sindhuratna, have been hospitalized after inhaling smoke emanating from one of the vessel's compartments early Wednesday while it was off the coast of Mumbai, the navy said. Two other sailors on the submarine had been reported missing. Their bodies were found Thursday in a smoke-affected compartment of the vessel, authorities said. Adm. D.K. Joshi, the navy's chief of staff, stepped down Wednesday after news of the problems on the submarine emerged, the government said. Joshi took ""moral responsibility for the accidents and incidents which have taken place during the past few months,"" the defense ministry said in a statement. The Indian navy declined to provide an exact number of how many incidents had taken place on vessels in recent months, saying only that there had been ""a couple of serious accidents involving submarines."" In August, an explosion and fire sank another of India's Russian-made submarines, the INS Sindhurakshak, killing all 18 sailors on board. That was the navy's deadliest peacetime disaster. The cause of the smoke Wednesday on the Sindhuratna is still under investigation, the navy said. The Indian navy has been struggling to modernize its aging submarine fleet, which, like much of the Indian military, relies heavily on Russian hardware. Analysts say the current number of submarines is far fewer than India needs to patrol is lengthy coastline, but plans to update the fleet have been held up because of technical problems, bureaucracy and higher-than-expected costs.","Two sailors who were missing are found dead, authorities say .

"Washington (CNN)The massacre of some of France's top cartoonists has turned a American nightmare -- that Western jihadists could return from war on terror battlefields to wreak carnage at home --  into reality. One of the two brothers suspected in the slaughter at the offices of a satirical magazine on Wednesday recently spent time in Yemen getting weapons training with one of the most dangerous Al-Qaeda affiliates in the world, US officials briefed on the matter told CNN's Barbara Starr. And a French source close to the French security services says there is also evidence that one of the brothers, Said and Cherif Kouachi, has traveled to the the killing fields of Syria. The chilling revelations open up a potentially dangerous new phase of the struggle against global terrorism because thousands of European fighters are estimated to be fighting with ISIS and other extremist groups -- a rich pool of radicals who could overwhelm Western intelligence agencies should they come home with orders to sow terrorist panic at home. Top officials in Washington have another deeply held fear. Since many Western jihadists have European Union passports, they enjoy visa-free access to the United States, opening the possibility that someone -- not known to U.S. and allied intelligence services and who is not on American no-fly lists like the Kouachi brothers -- could get into the United States. ""That's what multiplies our problem,"" Republican Rep Ed Royce told CNN on Thursday. ""Them returning to Europe is a direct threat to them eventually, potentially coming here."" The paramilitary-style assault on the satirical French publication Charlie Hebdo killed 12 people also underscored a shift away from spectacular, large-scale attacks waged by foreign terror groups like the strike on Sept. 11, 2001. Instead, homegrown radicals inspired by or affiliated with jihadist organizations are launching more limited strikes that still achieve the core aim of terrorism: death, widespread fear and panic. The shift makes the task of preventing further terrorist attacks even more daunting for Western leaders. They must sift through countless clues of potential small-scale, lone-wolf attacks while also blunting the possibility of another massive strike that could kill thousands in a single incident. ""It is becoming a more and more complex terrorist threat,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told CNN's Dana Bash. These are ""actors who may lurk within our society, that could strike with little notice, commit an act of violence because they have been inspired by things they have seen on the Internet, social media, in literature, without accepting a direct order from ... a terrorist organization."" The plague of homegrown terror by radicals inspired by -- and sometimes affiliated with -- al Qaeda, ISIS and other groups, seems to be spreading across the globe. In October, a convert to Islam and self-appointed jihadist provoked terror in Ottawa -- Canada's sleepy capital city -- by gunning down a soldier standing guard at a national war memorial. Two days earlier, a Canadian soldier was killed by a Muslim convert using a car as a deadly weapon. Just last month, a single hostage taker, apparently inspired by ISIS, seized a cafe in another unlikely terror hot spot -- Sydney, Australia -- killing two people before he was shot dead by police. And in 2013, homegrown terror hit London, when two British Muslim converts turned extremists hacked soldier Lee Rigby to death in a brazen daylight attack. Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the sheer simplicity of the attack in Paris, in which masked gunmen drove up to the Charlie Hebdo offices and started spraying automatic weapons was particularly disturbing. ""That's what keeps me up at night. The small scale attack that goes undetected,"" he said. In this new front on the war on terror, extremists no longer need to infiltrate fighters on daring missions to set off car bombs in European cities or to hijack fuel-laden airplanes to knock down skyscrapers. They can instead call on willing recruits already in the midst of Western societies, inspired by increasingly targeted calls by groups like ISIS and al Qaeda to wage war at home. So far, there are no signs that Wednesday's attack will lead to a heightened risk of terrorist actions in the United States. But the White House has long voiced fears that because of visa waiver programs with the United States, Europeans enjoy easy entry onto American soil, and radicals armed with nothing more than their maroon European Union passports could, in theory, export their terror. Senior U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials working closely with French counterparts will be especially keen to find out whether those behind the Paris attacks are veterans of ISIS' fight in Syria. The fact that thousands of radicalized, trained and battle-hardened killers with the skills and motivation to attack Western targets could be coming home from war is deeply concerning to American counterterrorism officials. ""If these are foreign fighters coming back, it would be our worst fears realized,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, a member of the House Intelligence Committee. But even if the attackers in Paris are not veterans of jihadism, they still may reflect a troubling evolution in the nature of terrorism, one that is especially hard for national security officials to combat. ISIS, which has carved up large swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq, has sought to inspire attacks on Western soil. It emerged recently in Australia that the group's leaders had told potential fighters not to travel to Syria, but to stage attacks at home. ""This really is a pattern,"" said Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who is now a CNN national security analyst. ""It is new in that they were able to pull it off."" Thomas Sanderson, an expert on international terrorism at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the risk to the United States from European fighters believed to have returned home after fighting in Syria and elsewhere was significant. Around 150 Americans are believed to have also joined the fight with ISIS. Sanderson also said videos of the assailants on the streets of Paris during the attack suggested they had some level of sophistication, a factor that will also alarm U.S. Homeland Security officials. ""They were not a couple of guys who woke up one day last week"" and decided to launch an attack, Sanderson said. ""I am guessing they had battlefield experience."" Adnan Kifayat, a former State Department envoy to Muslim communities, said the Paris attack was particularly serious because it suggested radical Islamic groups were now succeeding in their campaign to use propaganda and social media to radicalize Muslims to stay in their home nations to conduct terrorism. ""Some of the messaging has been focused on 'do what you can to help the cause from where you are,'""  said Kifayat, now with the German Marshall Fund of the United States. ""They are trying to activate people where they stand. That is obviously scary and moving into a newish front."" That kind of motivational rhetoric has shown to be effective in the United States as well. U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan was reportedly inspired by the teachings of and emails from Yemeni-based Islamic cleric Anwar al-Awlaki before going on a shooting rampage at a base in Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009, killing 13 people. The White House said Wednesday that it is paying attention to the risk posed by foreign fighters and the inspiration radicals could find from jihadist groups abroad. ""As a general matter, we are very mindful of the threat from foreign fighters and the threat and the need to try to counter some of the extremist ideology that ISIL is propagating using some pretty sophisticated social media strategies,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. Daniel Benjamin, a former State Department counterterrorism official now at Dartmouth College, said the Paris attack showed an evolution of terrorism in a number of ways. ""There hasn't been, to my knowledge, a major jihadist attack involving assault weapons in the West in memory,"" Benjamin said, and also noted that it was significant that Wednesday's assault took place in France, which despite having Europe's biggest Muslim population, has been largely spared large-scale attacks by radicalized Islamists. Benjamin cautioned that it remained unclear whether the attackers in the Paris incident were linked or inspired by ISIS or another radical terror group like one of the various branches of al Qaeda. But he said it was increasingly likely that ISIS successes in holding onto territory in the Middle East were having an impact in the West. ""We have seen, just in the last few months, whether it is in Sydney or in Ottawa or in other places, that the perceived successes of ISIS in holding territory in Iraq and in Syria have had a galvanizing effect on those with radical tendencies,"" he said. ""I fear this is something we are going to have to get used to.""","Paris attack underscores shift away from spectacular, large-scale attacks waged by foreign terror groups .

"(CNN)[Breaking news update, posted at 10.45 p.m. ET] . Sri Lanka's Mahinda Rajapaksa concedes defeat to opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena in the country's presidential election, prime minister-designate Ranil Wickremesinghe tells CNN. [Previous story, posted at 8.17 p.m. ET] . (CNN) -- In November, when Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa called an election two years earlier than necessary, the path ahead looked clear for an unprecedented third term in office. But as the nation of 15 million eligible voters waits for the results of yesterday's polls, the 69-year-old's electoral ambitions may be in jeopardy. After enabling an extension of his presidency by doing away with a two-term limit, Rajapaksa's campaign was spectacularly wrong-footed by the surprise defection of dozens of political allies -- including the man who now threatens to unseat him. Maithripala Sirisena, 63, was general-secretary of Rajapaksa's Sri Lanka Freedom Party and health minister in his cabinet when he defected. He is now challenging him for the presidency, on behalf of a broad opposition alliance analysts describe as the most serious challenge Rajapaksa has faced. The race -- which watchdogs say has been marred by hundreds of incidents of political violence and government misuse of state media -- has been too close to call. Opinion polls and analysts spoken to by CNN are divided on the outcome. ""It's not auguring very well for (Rajapaksa). He's got a contest on his hands,"" said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of Sri Lanka's Center for Policy Alternatives. He said Rajapaksa, accustomed to a weak and fragmented opposition, could not have anticipated facing a united alliance of nearly 40 parties -- including 23 parliamentarians who have defected from the president's own grouping, as well as nationalists from the Sinhalese majority and Tamil and Muslim minorities in the ethnically diverse nation. ""He didn't expect the candidate to be Sirisena,"" said Saravanamuttu. ""I think he probably underestimated the disaffection in the country and the desire for change."" 'Rock star appeal' Rajapaksa, a lawyer by trade, entered parliament in 1970, became prime minister in 2004 and was narrowly elected president a year later. In 2010, he was returned to power with 58% of the vote. His crowning achievement in office has been crushing the Tamil Tigers and bringing an end to the bloody 25-year civil war that had raged between the state and the Tamil separatists. The conduct of both the government and the Tamil Tigers was slammed by legal experts at the United Nations, who accused both sides in a 2011 report of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Yet the victory -- delivering security and renewed prosperity to the war-ravaged nation, with an average of 7% economic growth a year during his presidency -- remains his prime political asset, says Dayan Jayatilleke, a political scientist and former Sri Lankan diplomat. ""When voters turn on their TVs and they see the attack on Charlie Hebdo, on the Pakistan school, or Boko Haram, it reminds them of how hideous it is to live under terrorism,"" he said. ""That's something the Sri Lanka voters have done for years, and whatever they think of the rest of his style of governance, they think he's the guy who made it go away."" He says the folksy Rajapaksa, whose mustached face is a ubiquitous sight on posters throughout the island nation and is frequently likened to an ancient Sinhalese king, possesses ""a rock star appeal."" But despite this, dissatisfaction appears to be growing with his rule, which is increasingly seen by some as autocratic, corrupt and nepotistic, he says. Too much power? Following his 2010 reelection, an emboldened Rajapaksa amended the constitution to concentrate power in the presidential office and remove presidential term limits. To many Sri Lankans, says Saravanamuttu, the move felt excessive. ""They want the force of the executive president trimmed or abolished."" There is also a widespread perception, says Jayatilleka, that Rajapaksa ""has been ladling out a disproportionate share of resources to his family,"" and is focused on building a political dynasty. Three of Rajapaksa's brothers occupy powerful positions: Basil is the Minister of Economic Development, Gotabaya is Defense Secretary and Chamal is the Speaker of Parliament. Minorities alienated . The country's significant minorities -- Tamils, who comprise about 15% of the population, and Muslims, who account for 9% -- have also largely thrown their lot in with the opposition, says Jayatilleke. While Muslim voters had previously supported Rajapaksa over his vocal support for Palestinians, he had ""totally alienated"" them in recent times with his perceived tolerance of monk-led Buddhist extremist group Bodu Bala Sena (Buddhist Power Force), which supports Rajapaksa's bid for re-election. READ MORE: Fascists in saffron robes? The rise of the Bodu Bala Sena . Last month, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress defected to the opposition. The Bodu Bala Sena has been blamed for instigating outbursts of anti-Muslim mob violence, including a deadly rampage in the town of Aluthgama in June. READ MORE: Fear, shock among Sri Lankan Muslims in aftermath of mob violence . Sirisena's heartland appeal . Sirisena, who hails from the rice-producing North Central Province, also holds strong appeal as a candidate to Rajapaksa's traditional rural base in the ""Sinhalese heartland,"" says Jayatilleka. ""He's a Sinhala Buddhist from a peasant background -- you couldn't get more mainstream than that in Sri Lankan politics,"" he said. Jailed early in his career in 1971 during a communist insurrection, Sirisena rejoined mainstream politics through the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. While he lacks strong persona; charisma, coming across as ""a sober serious kind of man,"" Sirisena presented a more appetizing alternative to voters than other potential opposition candidates, said Jayatilleke. The opposition also benefited from having run a stronger campaign than the government, he said. So much so, Saravanamuttu says, that ""conventional wisdom suggests that (Sirisena) may have an edge"" at the polls. For his part, Jayatilleka disagrees, comparing Rajapaksa's prospects to those of Russian President Vladimir Putin during his most recent re-election. ""The international media expected Putin to lose because opinion in Moscow and St Petersburg was against him,"" he said. ""But in the provinces where most of the votes come from, they voted the other way, because Putin was seen as having crushed the Chechen terrorist threat and having restored the state of Russia in the world."" Jayatilleka's pick? ""Rajapaksa will probably lose all the cities. And the opposition, having won the campaign, will probably lose the election.""

"Los Angeles (CNN)Barbara Boxer's announcement that she would step down from her U.S. Senate seat is the golden opportunity that many of California's Democratic stars have waited years for, and it's touching off one of the most unpredictable and expensive scrambles for federal office in the Golden State in years. With California's two Senate seats locked down for more than two decades by Boxer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Boxer's announcement Thursday -- via a video with her grandson -- set up a key test of the state's top-two primary system. Given the shallow Republican bench in California, many political observers predicted a fierce runoff in November 2016 between two of the state's top Democrats, depending on who emerges from the June primary. Top Democratic contenders weigh California Senate run . ""There's an entire generation of Democratic politicians who have been waiting for an opportunity like this one,"" said Dan Schnur, executive director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. ""That's a lot of pent up energy and ambition."" Three of the strongest potential Democratic contenders for the seat — Attorney General Kamala Harris, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer — have been coy about their plans, praising Boxer's long tenure as a champion for progressive causes, but staying mum on their own ambitions. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa released a statement Saturday expressing his interest: ""Too many Californians are struggling to make ends meet, pay the bills, and send their kids to college. They are looking for progressive leaders in Washington who will fight for them, like Senator Boxer has done for over 20 years,"" the former Los Angeles mayor said in a statement. ""The urgency of the needs of the people of this great state have convinced me to seriously consider looking at running for California's open Senate seat."" Steyer is expected to make a decision within days. For the others, there was a political chess match underway behind the scenes. Boxer's vacancy could be just the first of three statewide openings in California in the next few years. The Governor's office will be vacant in 2018 and that's when Feinstein's current term expires. She could step down, though the 81-year-old senator has given no indication that she will retire. Pelosi on Boxer retirement: 'What?' Harris, Newsom and Villaraigosa have all expressed interest to confidantes in running both for Senate and Governor's race over the years. Harris and Newsom share the same California-based strategists, including Ace Smith, raising the possibility they could strike a pact where Harris runs for Boxer's seat and Newsom waits to run for Governor after his two terms as lieutenant governor. (Smith, who also advised Villaraigosa before the former Los Angeles Mayor returned to the private sector, is often mentioned as potential top strategist for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign). The two Northern California politicians have an amicable, if not close, relationship. If pitted against one another, they could split that region of the state between them -- clearing a path for a strong Southern California candidate like Villaraigosa, who has won prior races with strong support from Latinos. Increasing speculation about a deal this week, Harris and Newsom sent a message of unity on Monday when Newsom chose the Attorney General to administer his oath of office at his swearing in for his second term as lieutenant governor. Another wild card are the future plans of Gov. Jerry Brown, who faces term limits in 2018 after his fourth term as governor. Newsom, who has had a fraught relationship with Brown over the years, withdrew from his first bid for governor in 2009 after struggling to raise money with the specter of Brown entering the race. Brown, who barely campaigned in his re-election race last year and won overwhelmingly, has said little about what he would do after the Governor's office. Beyond those big names -- which rose to the top because of their strong fundraising potential in California, and Steyer's ability to self-fund -- the list of potential candidates seemed almost endless Thursday. More than a half-dozen members of Congress are weighing whether to jump into the race, as well as a number of state lawmakers and treasurer John Chiang, who is widely talked about as an underestimated candidate. But federal limits on fundraising are far more restrictive than state limits—setting up steep challenges for any of the contenders. Further complicating matters for Democrats, many well funded labor groups who have played an active role in other state races will be wary of choosing sides between high profile Democrats. While Republican Kevin McCarthy would be the most formidable candidate on the GOP side, he is unlikely to leave his post as House Majority Leader. Boxer's opponent in 2010, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, now resides in Virginia and is weighing a run for President. ""I don't think there's an obvious (Republican) contender,"" said longtime Republican Strategist Kenneth Khachigian, who advised Fiorina in her run against Boxer in 2010. ""California has become a very, very difficult state. It's going to be somewhat easier not to have to run against an incumbent, but 2016 will be a presidential year -- so the result is that there will be a lot heavier Democratic turnout, which makes it an even bigger hill to climb for a Republican."" Other Republicans who could throw their hat in the ring include Neel Kashkari, who ran unsuccessfully for governor against Brown last year, as well as Fresno Mayor Ashley Swearengin. But few GOP aspirants are thought to have a chance against the top tier Democratic contenders. ""This race is going to cost $20 million just to get to the starting gate,"" said longtime California political analyst Tony Quinn. ""There is nobody who would be likely to run as a Republican who could come up with that kind of money."" (Boxer, in conjunction with party committees raised more than $35 million for her 2010 re-election bid). Rep. Darrell Issa, who could have funded his own campaign, withdrew his name from consideration. Democrat Eric Garcetti was among the first to step aside, saying he was focused on his new job as Los Angeles Mayor. Boxer, who is 74 and was elected with Feinstein in the so-called ""year of the woman"" in 1992, did not reveal her leanings toward a potential successor during a call with reporters Thursday afternoon. If faced with a competitive Democratic race for her seat, she could very well opt not to endorse given how many people underestimated her in her own Senate race in 1992. When she ran in that cycle against two formidable Democrats, then-Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy and Rep. Mel Levine, Boxer was pressured to drop out, but pulled off a surprise victory: ""I was an asterisk,"" she mused Thursday. She said discussions of an endorsement were premature:  ""I don't know if one person will come forward or if 15 will come forward,"" Boxer told reporters on a call Thursday. She said she made her decision over the holidays to be fair to the contenders. ""I am doing it this early,"" Boxer said, ""because I think it's important for the field -- give them plenty of time to look at this; don't give any one person the advantage, and just send the message out loud and clear."" Feinstein similarly did not tip her hand on who she would favor in the race, but she noted that the candidates would need to get off to a fast start given the enormous expense of running a statewide campaign in California. ""Most candidates don't realize, until they've run, how big the state is and how you have to reach people,"" Feinstein said during a press gaggle on Capitol Hill Thursday.  ""You have to figure: 'How many hands can I shake in two years.  100,000?  200,000?'  (You've) got 38 million people. So it really comes down to media, unfortunately.""

"(CNN)Reaction to the massacre of cartoonists and journalists and others standing in the way in the Paris office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo will fall into two categories. One group will urge us to respect religions, to refrain from crossing a certain invisible line that offends. They will criticize the magazine, carefully prefacing their condemnation of the victims, the cartoonists and their editors, by saying that nothing justifies murder, but then they will make their point, explaining that their lampooning had simply gone too far, that they had it coming. There's another way to respond. It is the way a free society, threatened and intimidated by murderous extremists, reacts when its most fundamental principles are on the line. Satire, humor, even of the tasteless and offensive variety, must be defended without qualification. That is how we must respond. The last tweet from the magazine's account, just a few hours before masked gunmen broke in and killed at least a dozen people, features a cartoon wishing a happy new year ""and particularly good health"" to the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. That, in today's world, counts as courage of the highest order. At this writing, we have no confirmation of who carried out the attack, but we have experience with these sorts of acts. Our first modern-day encounter with the threat of murder against artists who ""offend"" came in 1989, when Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa (that's when we all learned the word), a religious decree ordering the assassination of the writer Salman Rushdie over his novel, ""The Satanic Verses."" Rushdie went into hiding. Bookstores carrying the novel were set ablaze, and the novel's Japanese translator was murdered. The world's reaction ranged from blazing outrage to cool, considered empathy for the injured feelings of the attackers. After Iran's new leader reaffirmed the Fatwa in 2012 and raised the bounty on Rushdie's head, the writer told an interviewer that he could draw a  ""straight line"" from the 1989 threat against him and the 9/11 attacks. Since then, assaults on freedom of expression have become almost routine, with a trail of death in their wake. What is most troubling is the extent to which those assaults have succeeded, by producing pre-emptive self-censorship in democratic societies. The most famous of all the controversies came in 2005, when the Danish daily Jyllands-Posten published cartoons of the prophet Mohammed. Islam forbids depictions of the prophet. Danish law, incidentally, does not. Activists used the cartoons to stir up anti-Western anger sparking protests against churches and embassies that left hundreds dead. The intimidation worked. I recall watching at home a TV interview in which the Danish editor unexpectedly raised an issue of the paper showing the cartoons, and someone in the studio nearly tackled the camera to the ground, apparently to prevent the images from airing. Discussions about the need to ""respect religions"" became popular throughout the West. Ireland even passed a law banning ""blasphemy."" The Irish definition of blasphemy, in case you were wondering, is ""publishing or uttering matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters sacred by any religion, thereby intentionally causing outrage among a substantial number of adherents of that religion."" Clearly, the law itself amounts to blasphemy against free expression. Most reasonable people don't advocate insulting any religion. But in a free society, people's feelings get hurt. We often cringe at what we hear. Publications such as Charlie Hebdo make us wince on a regular basis. Their targets are racists, extremists of all religions, and just about anyone that strikes their satirical interest. One drawing showed three rolls of toilet paper, labeled the Bible, the Koran, and the Torah, under the headline ""In the toilet, all the religions."" Christians, Jews, Muslims, politicians, businessmen, the innocent and the guilty have all come in for pictorial skewering, frequently in rather vulgar fashion. Offended? Too bad. You don't need to subscribe. You don't need to like it. But if you want to live in a world in which ideas flow freely, in which even the most powerful have no immunity from scrutiny, there is no question that the work must be defended. Extremists need no excuses. Satire is only the lowest hanging fruit. If the cartoonists are silenced, they will find plenty of other targets that upset their sense of right and wrong. Charlie Hebdo, and Salman Rushdie, and Theo van Gogh, the Dutch film director murdered for making a film about Islam, offended many people. The vast majority responded by moving on, or arguing in favor of their own views, not joining a rampage of murder. Art, comedy, satire in particular, stand at the forefront of democratic freedoms. Attacks against them serve as an alarm about threats to other aspects of our lives. A few years ago, gunmen in Damascus attacked the Syrian cartoonist Ali Ferzat. They beat him and broke his fingers after he drew a cartoon showing the dictator Bashar al-Assad hitching a ride out of town with Libya's Moammar Gadhaffi, who just been overthrown. Al-Assad could not take the joke. Tyrants and would-be tyrants cannot tolerate mockery. Democracies, free societies, have no choice. They must defend it as if their survival depended on it. Even if the jokes aren't funny. Even if they offend. Even if they create risk. That is why it was imperative that the film that upset the North Korean dictator be shown despite -- no, because of -- the threats. When the offices of Charlie Hebdo were set ablaze in 2011, after the paper published its ""Sharia Hebdo"" issue, which they said was ""guest edited"" by the prophet Muhammad, critics predictably complained that the publishers were asking for it, that it was all their fault. ""Sorry for your loss, Charlie,"" wrote Time Magazine. ""Do you still think the price you paid for printing and offensive, shameful, and singularly humor-deficient parody ... was so worthwhile."" The Hebdo editors certainly did. And now they have paid a much greater price. The people who would silence cartoonists have more than cartoons in their sights. It isn't just the drawings they don't like. If they would kill because of a cartoon, think how much about the rest of their lives they will find worth killing for.","Frida Ghitis: Some says Charlie Hebdo killings a signal to respect religions. That's wrong lesson .

"LIMA, Peru (CNN) -- A three-judge panel of the Peruvian Supreme Court found former President Alberto Fujimori guilty Tuesday on charges involving human rights violations, including murder and kidnapping, and sentenced him to 25 years in prison. Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori speaks before the court in Lima earlier this month. During the three-hour hearing that ended a 15-month trial, the 70-year-old former leader, wearing a dark suit and tie and sitting ramrod straight, wrote frequently in a notebook and occasionally sipped from a glass of water. He showed no emotion as the verdict was announced. Fujimori, whose parents were Japanese immigrants, had faced a possible 30 years in prison. Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of Human Rights Watch, expressed satisfaction with the sentence, calling it ""perfectly proportional to the grave deeds that are imputed to him."" ""This is an historic case,"" he told CNN en Español about the democratically elected former president's conviction on rights violations in his own country. The case is ""without precedent in the world, not just in Latin America,"" he said. ""After years of evading justice, Fujimori is finally being held to account for some of his crimes,"" said Maria McFarland, senior Americas researcher at Human Rights Watch, who was in the courtroom for the announcement. ""With this ruling, and its exemplary performance during the trial, the Peruvian court has shown the world that even former heads of state cannot expect to get away with serious crimes."" Judge Cesar San Martin told the courtroom that Fujimori was responsible for the actions of the Colina unit, blamed for killing dozens of people as the government sought to halt the Shining Path rebel group. Fujimori said he would appeal. Outside the courtroom, Fujimori's 33-year-old daughter, Keiko, herself running as a candidate in the 2011 presidential election, said the ruling was full of ""hate and vengeance."" ""We're going into the streets to demonstrate our open support for the best president this country has ever had, to the president who saved Peru from terrorism,"" she told reporters. But a group of relatives of the dead expressed satisfaction with the sentence. ""For the first time, they have respected the right of families to the truth and justice,"" said one woman. ""For the first time, they dignify the memory of the families ... I hope that this history of impunity not be allowed to recur."" Also outside the courtroom, pro- and anti-Fujimori activists scuffled, but there were no reports of serious injuries. Javier Zuniga, a special adviser to the secretary general for Amnesty International, was in the courtroom as the verdict was read. ""We have been with the families celebrating,"" he said several hours later. He praised the prosecutors, saying, ""They showed that what happened in the organization could not have happened if there had not been high-level planning, a state machinery to kill, organized by the president himself."" And he predicted that the case will be studied in law schools around the world. Fujimori, who is already serving a six-year sentence on separate charges involving abuse of power, led Peru from 1990 to 2000, at the height of the country's war with the radical Maoist Shining Path guerrillas and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. He was convicted of authorizing killings and kidnappings by paramilitary death squads in 1991 and 1992 during what is often referred to as Peru's ""dirty war."" ""I had to govern from hell, not a palace, but from a hell that those who accuse me did not live like I had to live,"" Fujimori recently told the court. ""I only expect that those who sentence me consider for a moment that hell and not pretend to civilize from a distance."" Fujimori's pro-business policies were credited with helping steer the country away from financial disaster in the early 1990s, and he remains popular among many of his countrymen. Journalist Maria Elena Belaunde contributed to this story from Lima, Peru.","NEW: Former Peruvian president sentenced to 25 years in prison .

"(CNN)Talk about a traveler's nightmare. Amtrak passengers cooled their heels -- and the rest of their bodies -- for 13½ hours before their train finally pulled out of Chicago's Union Station on Thursday morning. ""I had on leggings, a pair of wool socks, winter boots, a long-sleeve shirt, zip-up pullover, a fleece, a winter down jacket, hat, gloves and scarf,"" said passenger Kristine Charbonneau. ""I ended up adding my sweatpants and blankets."" Some of the Amtrak passengers shivered inside Union Station during the wait, she said. ""They had the heat turned down,"" Charbonneau said. ""Finally at 3 a.m. the facilities guy came in here and turned up heat — said he did it before morning rush hour. We were freezing down there. ""People were begging for food,"" she said. ""They finally brought snacks for us."" The delay for Amtrak 48/448 was caused by mechanical problems, including frozen brakes, said Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari. Winter weather caused other transportation problems, especially in the Midwest. More than 400 flights were canceled Thursday at Chicago O'Hare and Midway airports, said the Chicago Department of Aviation, and the Minnesota State Patrol reported 589 auto crashes. The Iowa Department of Transportation said a dozen snowplows were involved in crashes with other vehicles, according to the agency's Facebook page. In Chicago, the Amtrak assengers arrived at the station expecting the train to leave at 9:30 p.m. Wednesday. After the long wait, the train finally headed to New York and Boston at 11:08 a.m. Thursday, he said. It's expected to arrive about 5:30 a.m. Friday at Penn Station in New York, he said. Amtrak sold 144 tickets for the train, plus another 20 that will go to Boston only. Magliari said waiting passengers could sit in the station or on the train, which has sleeping compartments and reclining seats. ""We fed people and had hot chocolate and drinks, of course, on the train,"" he said. To add to their frustration, the passengers endured a false start toward their destination. The train initially left Chicago about 8 a.m. Thursday, but Norfolk Southern realized train employees had been on the clock too long,  said Robin Chapman, director of public relations for Norfolk Southern. The train was ordered back to Union Station for a fresh crew, Chapman said. ""Amtrak 48 was ready to go but it was 10.5 hours late because it had had an engine failure,"" Chapman said. ""The crew only had 15 minutes left on their service time because of the hours of service regulation. We could not let them go."" For the passengers, it was one more thing. ""We passed White Sox Stadium and stopped for about half an hour,"" Charbonneau said. ""Our conductor got back on and said that our replacement crew can only work for so many hours. ... There were some people who were really upset."" Amtrak will offer refunds, Magliari said. Charbonneau said she'll be demanding one.

"Washington (CNN)Potential Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson is apologizing after being accused of plagiarism -- even as the author of one of the books Carson is accused of lifting material from is rushing to his defense. ""I attempted to appropriately cite and acknowledge all sources in America the Beautiful, but inadvertently missed some. I apologize, and I am working with my editors to rectify the situation,"" Carson said in a statement his representative, Armstrong Williams, provided to CNN. BuzzFeed News broke the story earlier this week that Carson had lifted material from a number of books and online sources for his 2012 book ""America the Beautiful."" Among those sources is SocialismSucks.net, a site whose founder acknowledged to BuzzFeed that Carson had taken some of his comments. Other sources included ""The Five Thousand Year Leap"" by W. Cleon Skousen, a Liberty Institute press release, CBS News and author William Federer's book ""America's God and Country."" Carson, a neurosurgeon who's said he'll make a decision on a 2016 bid by this spring, is the latest GOP presidential contender to be hit with plagiarism charges. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) faced similar accusations about his own book in 2013. The plagiarism charges have ""blindsided"" Carson, a source close to the neurosurgeon reportedly told the National Review Online. ""Alongside the author, we too take these matters very seriously. We have been in contact with the author and agent and will work with them to review the given information. We will respond as appropriate,"" a spokesperson for HarperCollins Christian publishing, which published Carson's book, told BuzzFeed. Federer, though, told CNN in an email that he'd given Carson permission to use his material -- and he even read and signed off on the final product. He said he met Carson while the two served on a university board, and handed him copies of his books during a shuttle ride on campus. ""I told him that I hoped he would find them interesting and that he had full permission to use any of the material in the books as he liked,"" Federer said. ""One of the books I gave him was specifically designed to be quoted,"" he said, noting that its subtitle specifically says that the material is for use in speeches, papers, debates, essays and articles, including those by elected officials. He then listed 16 acknowledgments and citations of his work in Carson's book, saying that ""it is obvious that Dr. Ben Carson has made demonstrable effort to make proper attribution. Indeed, his overt acknowledgments have resulted in numerous individuals contacting me to purchase the book."" Carson did not immediately respond to request for comment.

"(CNN)Martin Boudot was working in his Paris office Wednesday when a colleague told him two men were standing outside with ""Kalashnikovs."" They were trying to get into the building. Moments later, the massacre erupted in the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo feet away from Boudot, he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""We heard the first shots and then more and more shots, right across the whole five or six minutes."" And they heard screams, said Boudot, who is a documentarian. They ran for the roof, while their minds raced through possible dangers. ""We knew that there were victims a few meters away from us, but there might be, you know, some explosives somewhere or maybe a third guy,"" Boudot said. Separating men from women . In the offices of Charlie Hebdo, the masked gunmen dressed in black apparently barged in on a conference. Survivors later told their stories to a doctor who treated them. He relayed them to CNN. The gunman separated the men from the women and called out names of cartoonists. Then they fired. Not randomly spraying bullets, but taking professional, precise aim. They left the building, and cell phone video captured them as they ran in the street and kept firing. One of the masked men ran over to a man in uniform lying apparently wounded on the sidewalk and shot him at close range. The two said they were avenging the Prophet Mohammed and shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" which translates to ""God is great,"" a French official said. Video shows a gunman approaching his black getaway car and raising his finger. Perhaps it was a signal. A coveted target . When the gunfire ceased, Boudot and his colleagues went back into the building. They couldn't have been too surprised that the satire magazine had been attacked. Threats against it had been widely reported. Charlie Hebdo's previous offices had been fire-bombed three years before, the day it was to publish a provocative cover lampooning the Muslim prophet Mohammed. They moved to their current office a year ago, Paul Moreira, who works in the building, told CNN's Erin Burnett. The magazine refused to change anything and kept publishing irreverent cartoons on Islam but also on Christianity, Judaism, politics and society -- in its usual profane style. Charlie Hebdo's editor, cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier -- ""Charb"" for short --  was on an al Qaeda target list. The gunmen killed him, as they did three other famous cartoonists, known by the pen names Cabu, Wolinski and Tignous. Charb was constantly guarded, Dutch journalist Stefan de Vries told CNN's Don Lemon. ""He was always accompanied by one or two secret service officers. Everywhere we went, for the last four years. At day and at night, so he was protected,"" he said. De Vries thinks one of those killed was a body guard. Bodies on the left . In the meeting room, Boudot saw bodies lying off to the left. Survivors were either hiding or standing. ""They were just standing like -- not zombies -- but they were standing and didn't do anything,"" he said. ""We tried to help the very first one, but actually, to be honest, there were not a lot of wounded, they were just people dead, all around."" But the gunman had not only killed in the meeting room. Moreira made his way to Charlie Hebdo's offices as well. The first thing he saw was the body of a building doorman. ""This grumpy guy we liked and appreciated. He was lying down in his blood, and he was dead; he had been shot by the gunners."" Blood stained the stairways, where heavily wounded people lay. A man Moreira knew for 20 years had been shot in each leg. Moreira went up to the cartoonists' offices. Witnesses huddled with survivors. ""They were in one room, some crying hysterical. Some were, like, prostrated and not capable of saying anything, saying a word,"" Moreira said. The gunmen had shot dead eight of their colleagues, as well as a guest, the doorman and two police officers. On Thursday, businesses around the corner in the trendy inner city neighborhood reopened, cafes filled with patrons and traffic congested streets. Aside from a covey of journalists' satellite trucks the only sign of the carnage a day earlier was a tribute taped to a tree. A bouquet of roses and a quote by a French philosopher. It read, ""There is only one step from fanaticism to barbarism.""","A man saw the gunmen trying to get in .

"Washington (CNN)U.S. officials and lawmakers reeling from the tragic terrorist attack in Paris that killed 12 are turning the attention back home as they assess what the attack means for U.S. national security. Republican members privy to the Senate's top intelligence briefings criticized President Barack Obama's terror-fighting policies and U.S. national security agencies began scanning their databases Thursday amid reports that the two gunmen in Wednesdays' attack traveled to Syria this summer and as suspicions swirled that the pair were influenced by ISIS. And one Republican lawmaker is staying away from criticizing Obama, instead introducing legislation to keep Americans who join terror groups off American soil. American officials have been in close coordination with French officials as the hunt for the two gunmen continued into Thursday and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to Paris on Sunday to meet with the French interior minister and others to discuss counterterrorism and the threat of foreign fighters. But earlier in the day, Sens. John McCain, Susan Collins and Marco Rubio called out what they view as the failures of the Obama administration's fight against terrorism after walking out of an unrelated intelligence briefing. ""As long as ISIS succeeds, that will breed this kind of terrorist who goes to Syria, Iraq and fight, return to the country from which they came from -- not only radicalized, but well trained,"" McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee said.  ""And that is the reason why the administration is failing in not devoting the sufficient effort to destroy ISIS which is what the President's stated goal is...when in fact there is no strategy to do so."" McCain has repeatedly slammed Obama's foreign policy as too timid and has called for a wider campaign in Iraq and Syria to accomplish the president's goal to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" ISIS, the militant group which has claimed broad swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. The United States is leading a coalitions of countries from Europe and the Middle East in a military campaign centered around airstrikes and military advisers to bolster Iraqi security forces and combat ISIS. Obama has been repeatedly slammed for ruling out sending combat troops and criticized by McCain for not doing enough to help moderate rebels in Syria. McCain suggested Obama doesn't understand ""the gravity"" of the radical Islamist threat, which Maine's Sen. Collins and Florida's Sen. Rubio echoed, attacking the President's past claims that the U.S. has decimated al-Qaeda's core and is on the path to victory in the war on terror. Obama made those comments before the rise of ISIS, a group which grew out of remnants of al Qaeda leadership in Iraq. ""Despite the President's assertion that the war on terror was over and that al-Qaeda was on the road to defeat, this is not accurate,"" Rubio said. And Collins focused on the growing threat of foreign fighters, thousands of which have left their homes in Europe and the United States to fight in Syria -- some of whom risk returning to the West to carry out attacks. And amid suspicions that that was the case in Paris on Wednesday, the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and intelligence agencies are evaluating high priority targets living in the U.S., including foreign fighters who may have returned to the U.S. after fighting in Syria. ""Whenever something like this happens you want to make sure you tighten things up,"" a U.S. official with firsthand knowledge of the efforts told CNN. The attack in Paris is also giving new fire to legislation Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) believes will help prevent Americans who join ISIS or other terrorist organizations from returning to the U.S. Poe is reintroducing a bill in the coming days that will compel the State Department to revoke the passports of Americans who join or assist any foreign terrorist organization. Poe unsuccessfully pushed the legislation in the House in September, but he said the attack in Paris underscores the need for such legislation. ""This tragedy in Paris lets us all know  that homegrown terrorists exist all over the world,"" said Poe, who is chairman of the subcommittee on homeland security. ""They're going to Syria, being trained and we don't want them coming back into the United States."" Sen. Ted Cruz will also reintroduce similar legislation in the Senate, his spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told CNN. The Texas Republican introduced a bill last year to strip Americans who join terrorist organizations of both their passports and their citizenship. Reports indicate the pair of terrorists (both French citizens) traveled to Syria last summer and Poe suggested they would not have been able to return to France if similar legislation existed there. CNN Law Enforcement Analyst Tom Fuentes said revoking passports is an important tool, but the challenge will be determining whether an individual is actually joining a terror group. And with thousands of foreign fighters and hundreds of thousands on the terror watch list, Fuentes said people will inevitably slip through the cracks. Poe will also introduce two bills requiring the State Department in coordination with other agencies to submit reports on the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria and terrorist groups' use of social media, which groups like ISIS have used to recruit and radicalize foreigners. Poe said he believes the U.S. should work more closely with social media companies like Twitter to purge sites of terrorist propaganda. ""With what's happened in France, Americans need to understand that this is an ongoing problem that we're facing,"" Poe said. Collins called the terrorist threat today greater than ever and said the Paris attack ""reminds us that the terrorist threat is still very real for this country as well as for other Western nations."" ""The idea that the administration at one point said that core al-Qaeda had been decimated and that we were far safer is just not accurate,"" Collins said. ""And in all my time of studying homeland security issues and the terrorist threat I can't think of a time where the threat level is more dangerous."" Collins added that the U.S. has greater capabilities today to thwart terror attacks, but that the expansive influence of ISIS and other terror groups via the Internet and social media has created a ""lone wolf problem,"" which is harder to address. U.S. and French law enforcement and intelligence agencies are still working to determine the circumstances behind the terror attack in Paris and whether the two brothers who attacked French publication Charlie Hebdo were acting on their own or with orders from a terrorist group, like ISIS.","Republican lawmakers slammed Obama's foreign policy after a terror attack in Paris .

"If prosecutors plan to argue former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez was the one who fired seven rounds into Odin Lloyd, they won't be able to show the alleged murder weapon to make their case. That's because the .45 caliber gun used to kill Lloyd has never been found. ""That's a hurdle,"" attorney and sports analyst Michael McCann told CNN. Prosecutors have charged Hernandez, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz with first-degree murder, however, more than a year since the June 17, 2013, homicide, prosecutors have yet to definitively say who was the alleged trigger man. All three men have pleaded not guilty. Despite extensive searches of Hernandez's home, his apartment, his cars, an uncle's home, the crime scene, woods, dumpsters, and a lake in Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, what happened to the alleged murder weapon remains a mystery. Inside the case against Aaron Hernandez . ""To be sure, someone can be convicted without a murder weapon,"" McCann said.  ""We know that. But it's harder."" Authorities said in court that they recovered five rounds from Lloyd's body. An autopsy revealed two more rounds went through his body. Those rounds were later dug up from the soil in the industrial park where Lloyd was shot.  A shell casing was also found in the rental car that prosecutors say Hernandez drove to the crime scene. All the rounds are .45 caliber, according to authorities. Who was Odin Lloyd? Surveillance video from Hernandez's home security system shows the former NFL player arriving back at his house with two other people, according to the district attorney. Prosecutors believe the gun seen in Hernandez's left hand is the alleged murder weapon, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. ""He's last seen with the firearm before he goes down to the basement door,"" Bristol County District Attorney William McCauley told a judge at a June 16 hearing. Two witnesses have testified before a grand jury that Hernandez kept a .45 gun in a black metal box in his basement, McCauley told the court. Fast facts: Aaron Hernandez . The day after Lloyd's body was found, Hernandez sent a mysterious ""coded"" text message to his fiancée Shayanna Jenkins and asked her get something out of their basement, according to search warrant affidavits. ""Go back in back of the screen in movie room when u (sic) get home an (sic) there is a box...jus (sic) in case u (sic) were looking for it!!! ... WAS JUST THINKIN bout that lol wink wink love u TTYL....K"" ""TTYL"" is common shorthand for ""talk to you later."" 2013: Investigation turns to fiancée . A home surveillance video shows Jenkins leaving the house about an hour later and carrying something ""rigid"" and ""consistent to a lock box or safe"" placed inside a garbage bag and covered with children's clothing, according to the documents. Jenkins later testified before a grand jury. According to prosecutor McCauley, ""She said it was a box ... and it was heavy, it was approximately 25 pounds."" On video, Jenkins is allegedly seen returning home without the ""rigid"" item. Prosecutors said Jenkins testified she got rid of the box. ""It goes into the dumpster,"" McCauley told a judge. ""Later on when she's questioned about that, she can't recall where she put that. That item or items were never recovered."" Jenkins has been charged with perjury and has pleaded not guilty. Her attorneys have said they will not comment on her case. In pre-trial hearings, Hernandez's lawyers have argued prosecutors have no evidence as to what was in the box. ""I mean, who knows?"" co-counsel James Sultan told the court.  ""It could be drugs, it could be something that was connected to this crime that he knew about, that he was covering up for somebody else after the fact. There are all kinds of possibilities ... But that's not probable cause that he committed murder."" Authorities did seize other guns from the former tight end's home and apartment, as well as .45 caliber ammunition. Hernandez also has pleaded not guilty to five other weapons-related charges. Unlike the missing weapon in the Lloyd case, police have found a .38 caliber gun they accuse Hernandez of using to kill Safiro Furtado and Daniel Abreu in Boston in July 2012. Police have not established a connection between the gun and Hernandez. Hernandez is charged as the sole shooter in that case and has pleaded not guilty. Can prosecutors persuade a jury in the Lloyd case that they don't need to see the weapon involved? ""Given the large number of TV shows devoted to crime ... jurors are always receptive to the popular defense argument that 'missing evidence' creates reasonable doubt in prosecutor's case,"" said CNN analyst and former New York prosecutor Paul Callan. Yet, Callan added, authorities can argue there was plenty of time to ditch the weapon. ""After all we still haven't found Jimmy Hoffa, so explaining away a missing gun is not particularly difficult if other evidence is compelling and persuasive,"" he said.","Aaron Hernandez has been charged with three killings .
He has pleaded not guilty .
The weapon used in the death of Odin Lloyd has not been found ."
"Phoenix (CNN)President Barack Obama's three day cross country trip, designed to build support for his economic priorities ahead of his State of the Union speech, is being sidelined by the terror attacks in Paris. Mr. Obama held an unscheduled photo op in the Oval Office before leaving Washington on Wednesday to address the attacks. And aboard Air Force One on his flight to Detroit, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was peppered with questions like,  ""With respect to the situation in Paris, does the U.S. have an assessment...on who these gunmen were?""  And, ""At this point, you can't say whether these gunmen were linked to any terror organization?"" And, ""..is the U.S. concerned about any risk here from this group?"" The economy only came up later. Earnest even made a rare second appearance in the press section of Air Force One to advise reporters that the president had called French President Francois Hollande aboard the flight. But despite the focus on Paris from much of the national media, once the President arrived in Detroit and Phoenix, he stuck to his message that his policies are responsible for the rebounding U.S. economy and the resurgence of growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs. In Phoenix Thursday, he made an unscheduled stop at a housing development where new homes were being built to highlight the uptick in housing prices. And at a speech at the city's Central High School, he focused on that comeback, and steps he is taking to make sure it continues. With HUD Secretary Julian Castro by his side, the President even announced a half percent cut in FHA mortgage loan rates to help families. And he said his administration's policies are responsible for the economic turnaround. ""As a result of all these efforts, today home sales are up 50 percent."" He said as a result of homes sales coming back, more than a hundred thousand construction jobs have been created and added,  ""This progress is not an accident. It's what happens when you have policies that put middle class families first."" However, several reporters from different networks were still emailing the press secretary late Thursday morning to ask if the president would address the French terror crisis in his remarks.  He did not. At an event with 750 autoworkers at a Ford manufacturing plant in Wayne, Michigan, on Wednesday the President  said,  ""there is no doubt, thanks to the steps that we took early on to rescue our economy and to rebuild it on a new foundation, we are entering into the New Year with new confidence that America is coming back."" The President added: ""that's going to be the focus of my State of the Union address in a couple of weeks -- building on the progress that we've already made."" Perhaps Friday will be a breakthrough day, as he heads to Knoxville, Tennessee, to talk about expanding higher education opportunities for millions of students. He still has two weeks before the State of the Union to make his sales pitch to Americans and then directly to the new Republican led Congress.","Obama is pushing economic priorities ahead of State of the Union speech .

"(CNN)The chairman of the Iowa Republican Party says he hasn't heard yet from former Gov. Jeb Bush about his interest in the 2016 presidential race. ""If it's Valentine's Day and I still haven't heard from him I'll be surprised,"" Jeff Kaufmann told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. While Bush campaigned for 2014 candidates last year, he didn't hit the early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the first two nominating contests and where other potential presidential contenders have already made frequent visits. The former Florida governor last month went to South Carolina, which holds the first-in-the-South primary, to speak to graduates at the University of South Carolina, but he hasn't engaged in the traditional, on-the-ground retail politicking that's expected in some of these early states. Bush only recently announced that he's ""actively"" exploring a presidential bid, and his team and supporters have quickly started organizing behind the scenes to form political action committees that will help him travel to meet with voters and donors as he also campaigns for non-presidential candidates. His leadership PAC, Right to Rise, held its first fundraiser Wednesday night in Greenwich, Connecticut, which was attended by former high profile figures in the administration of his brother, George W. Bush. GOP strategist Ford O'Connell said now is the time for Bush to focus on doing the behind-the-scenes action like securing financial commitments and organizing his team so he can be better positioned to ward off other potential GOP contenders. ""You got to convince these donors that you're serious, and you have to have a pre-campaign vehicle to do it,"" O'Connell said, referring to the leadership PAC. Bush has declined to attend a social conservative gathering in Iowa later this month that will feature a hoard of other potential candidates, like Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, Ben Carson and Rick Santorum. Steve Deace, a native Iowan and conservative radio host, argued it's a mistake for Bush to skip the Iowa Freedom Summit, which is hosted by Rep. Steve King and the conservative group Citizens United. ""If you're not willing to speak to a conservative group that even Chris Christie is willing to speak to, you're probably in the wrong party,"" Deace said in an interview. ""If you don't come here and let people see you--this is true in both parties--and let them rub elbows with you, you're not going to win,"" he added. The former governor, however, already has an advantage over the other candidates thanks to name recognition and ties to the Bush family donor network. A recent CNN/ORC International Poll indicated Bush was the frontrunner of the crowded field of possible GOP candidates, with 23% support. Republican strategist and Bush supporter Ana Navarro, who's also a CNN contributor, said Bush is focused on fundraising and organizing but added voters can expect Bush do some public events in the coming weeks. ""Jeb has got his groove back,"" Navarro said, adding that the former governor is ""working long hours"" and working hard to build his team. She stressed a similar line from the announcement of the PAC, saying that he won't ""cede an inch of territory"" on issues or demographic groups. Bush's spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, did not respond to a request for comment from CNN about his travel schedule. Campbell told the Wall Street Journal that Bush ""will travel to states around the country in the coming months to support conservative candidates and causes.""","The Iowa GOP chairman says he hasn't heard from Jeb Bush about a potential campaign .
Iowa holds the first-in-the-nation nominating contest and is considered a must-stop for likely candidates .
Bush is working quickly and behind the scenes to build his team and secure financial resources ."
"(CNN)Yes, it's winter. And yes, it's cold. But this is different. Just ask Richard Thomas, owner of R. Thomas Deluxe Grill in Atlanta. He keeps a dozen birds outside the restaurant and never, in his 30 years, has he had to move them inside. But that's exactly what he scrambled to do Sunday. ""The weather prediction made me nervous,"" said Thomas, 80. ""Rather than risk danger to any of my buddies, so to speak, I just decided to make that decision."" As many as 140 million Americans are bracing this week for a polar blast that's barreling across the country, dumping snow in some places and shattering records. Much of the United States will see the coldest temperatures in almost 20 years, according to the National Weather Service. They are expected to be 30 to 50 degrees below average in some cities. To put things in perspective, the weather in Atlanta and Nashville, Tennessee, on Monday will be colder than in Anchorage, Alaska. By Wednesday, nearly half the nation will shudder in temperatures of zero or lower, forecasters said. The unusual weather is already causing headaches, especially for travelers. Close to 3,000 flights were canceled Sunday, said the flight-tracking website flightaware.com, which tracks cancellations due to weather, mechanical and other problems. A man at Logan International Airport in Boston told CNN affiliate WCVB that he will miss two days of a cruise because he can't get to Florida as planned to meet the boat. Another passenger at Logan was overcome with emotion as she spoke, her voice cracking under the stress. ""I just want to go home. I just want to get back, settled in. We've been cooped up for two days,"" WCVB reported Amy Roy said. Here's a look at what's happening around the country: . Midwestern snow and one freakishly cold game . Snow was falling across the Midwest. In Brownsburg, Indiana, more than 4 inches had fallen during the morning, said iReporter Bill Byrd. ""Most people are staying in their homes, and church services are canceled,"" he told CNN. iReport: Watch heavy snow create a beautiful scene in Indiana . Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard told residents to stay off the streets, especially after nightfall. ""It's not just a snow event, it's a cold event, and that's what scares us,"" he said. Parents should keep an eye on their kids who might be out sledding into the evening hours -- there is no school Monday -- and check to make sure they don't get frostbite. In Wisconsin, a sold-out crowd more than 70,000 hardcore Green Bay Packers endured temperatures between 4 and 8 degrees. With the wind, the air could have felt as cold as minus 15 degrees. ""You can prepare for it, but you can't really prepare for it. We've been doing this our whole life up here. It's what Green Bay is all about -- it's cold weather and hard-hitting football,"" said Jason Gibbs. The Packers offered free hand warmers, hot chocolate and coffee at the afternoon game, spokesman Aaron Popkey said. Green Bay lost 23-20 to the San Francisco 49ers. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Packers fans could suffer hypothermia or frostbite . In Embarrass, Minnesota, residents wondered whether they might see their record-cold temperature of 64 below zero, set in 1996, snap like an icicle. ""I've got a thermometer from the weather service that goes to 100 below,"" resident Roland Fowler told CNN affiliate KQDS. ""If it gets that cold, I don't want to be here."" Because of conditions in the Windy City, officials said Chicago Public Schools will be closed Monday. The city had 12 centers for residents to seek warmth, one of which was to stay open all night through Tuesday. Libraries and some other city facilities would also be open, said Evelyn Diaz, the city's commissioner of the Department of Family and Support Services. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn said 100 warming centers were open statewide. In St. Louis, authorities used an alert system to call people who might need assistance. More than 80 didn't answer, Mayor Francis Slay said, so police were going to check on them. Slay also said that the city would close on Monday except for emergency personnel. ""We expect this to be a three-day event,"" he said, adding that 80 snowplows would be used to keep primary roads passable. The Deep South . The arctic blast threatens to sweep subzero lows as far south as Alabama and plunge much of the Deep South into the single digits. Freezing rain is also possible along the Appalachians all the way up to New England over the next couple of days, the National Weather Service said. Deadly conditions . The low temperatures and wind chill are a dangerous recipe for rapid frostbite or hypothermia. ""Exposed flesh can freeze in as little as five minutes with wind chills colder than 50 below,"" the National Weather Service's Twin Cities office in Minnesota said. Over the past week, at least 13 people have died from weather-related conditions. Eleven people died in road accidents -- including one man crushed as he was moving street salt with a forklift. One man in Wisconsin died of hypothermia. And an elderly woman with Alzheimer's disease in New York state wandered away from her home and was found dead in the snow in a wooded area about 100 yards away. Travel nightmares . John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York closed briefly after an incident involving a regional jet, Delta Flight 4100 from Toronto. Port Authority spokesman Ron Marsico said the plane, carrying 32 passengers, skidded into a snow bank while turning onto a taxiway after landing safely. No injuries were reported.  The aircraft was towed to the gate, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Flight operations were suspended for about two hours. The FAA reported lengthy delays at several large airports including Detroit Metro Airport, Philadelphia International, and LaGuardia in New York. As snow fell in Missouri, Interstate 44 in Webster County was closed because of an accident involving multiple tractor-trailers, according to the state's Department of Transportation website. The highway was also closed in Greene County when a semi crashed as it headed west. The bad weather was headed east. Cities like Cincinnati; Lexington, Kentucky; Louisville, Kentucky; and Memphis saw temperatures crash Sunday, and precipitation could lead to dangerous, icy driving conditions. Roads will worsen Sunday night in Atlanta; Birmingham, Alabama; and Knoxville, Tennessee, forecasters said. 8 tips to ease winter travel woes . This, too, shall pass . If there's any good news about the biting cold snap, it's that much of it should be over for the Midwest by Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. In the meantime, those in the western part of the country can skip all the fuss. Most of the West can expect relatively pleasant weather through Monday.

"An attorney who says he is representing more than a dozen celebrities whose iCloud accounts were hacked and nude photos stolen fired off a strongly worded letter on Wednesday to Google: Immediately remove all the images from your platforms or face a $100 million lawsuit. Marty Singer -- whose past client roster includes Britney Spears, Kim Kardashian, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt  -- sent a letter to Google on behalf of several  female ""actresses, models, and athletes whose confidential, personal, private photos and videos"" were stolen in late August. Stars including Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and Rihanna have reportedly been part of a group of more than 100 who had their accounts hacked and images stolen. Attorney Singer criticized Google for its ""despicable, reprehensible conduct in not only failing to act expeditiously and responsibly to remove the Images, but in knowingly accommodating, facilitating and perpetuating the unlawful conduct."" 5 Things to know about the celebrity nude photo hacking scandal . According to Singer, Google was notified that the images were stolen on more than a dozen occasions. He accuses the company of refusing to act to remove all of the images from its platforms pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. T . The letter notes other website operators and host providers -- including Twitter -- have accommodated take-down demands, but claims Google ""has recklessly allowed these blatant violations to continue in conscious disregard of our clients' rights.""  The letter specifically references images that are still available on Google sites including BlogSpot and YouTube. Singer's letter says: ""Because the victims are celebrities with valuable publicity rights, you do nothing  -- nothing but collect millions of dollars in advertising revenue from your co-conspirator advertising partners as you seek to capitalize on this scandal rather than quash it. Like the NFL, which turned a blind eye while its players assaulted and victimized women and children, Google has turned a blind eye while its sites repeatedly exploit and victimize these women."" Google for its part is disputing the accusations. A spokesperson for the search engine giant told CNN, ""We've removed tens of thousands of pictures -- within hours of the requests being made -- and we have closed hundreds of accounts.  The Internet is used for many good things.  Stealing people's private photos is not one of them."" Singer has not disclosed who he is specifically representing in this case.

"America's food police are patrolling and arresting suspicious French dairy products, which are either delicious cheese or a bacteria-laden menace.  You decide. The Los Angeles Times reports that Food and Drug Administration rules could effectively ban age-old recipes for cheeses like Roquefort, St. Nectaire, Morbier and Tomme de Savoie. According to Washington's Righteous Cheese shop manager, Peter McNamara, imported soft cheeses of all kinds are especially hard to come by. ""There's a lot of confusion (over the rules) ... getting hold of any soft cheese is really a pain,"" McNamara said. The FDA says it is not aware of a cheese shortage. The food safety agency's concern is with the cheeses' two main ingredients: raw milk and bacteria. Too bad for foodies, the FDA doesn't care that bacteria makes cheese. Since bacteria like E. coli and listeria kill people, all bacteria must be bad, right? Well, the problem is our bodies are teeming with bacteria, even the dreaded E. coli, according to the World Health Organization. Although we have plenty of non-toxigenic E. coli in our intestines, the toxic kind kills. The FDA is testing for all kinds and giving out failing grades to cheeses that had too much of the non-toxigenic E. coli as well. While non-toxigenic E. coli won't kill consumers, if a food production facility has it on the food, the FDA, after a long review process, determines it must be filthy. According to FDA spokeswoman Lauren Sucher, ""The current level is in line with standards around the world, and FDA expects that properly manufactured milk products, whether made from raw milk or pasteurized milk, should not be affected."" Presumably France does not agree. In this case, the FDA made a new rule in 2010 to reduce the amount of allowable E. coli by 90%.  But field officers hadn't been enforcing it until recently, according to the American Cheese Society's executive director, Nora Weiser. The fact that the French producers of Roquefort can trace their production lineage back a millennium doesn't seem to matter to the FDA. Earlier this year, the FDA similarly proposed banning wood-board aged cheeses because of bacteria. It later backed off. French cheese makers aren't the only ones on the front lines of the FDA's war on raw milk. The FDA also has launched raids of Amish farms to wipe out the scourge of raw milk.","FDA rules target bacteria in French cheese .

"(CNN) -- When homeless mothers in Sacramento, California, need food, counseling or support, they can come to a rectangle-shaped cinderblock building just a few blocks from the American River. The building is home to Maryhouse, a daytime homeless shelter. Connie Frank is the executive director and it's her job is to connect the women with social services. Many of them need help finding nighttime shelter, counseling and food. For Frank, the Women Infants and Children program is a key service. ""It's a wonderful program, an essential program, to feed these families,"" she said. ""Baby formula, for example, is very expensive, and while we encourage women to breast feed, often they can't. Breast feeding moms need extra calories, and many of the women we serve can't get those extra calories while they are homeless, even if they are on food stamps."" Last year, 1,250 children came to Maryhouse -- a 29% increase. ""It would make me sad to see fewer women eligible for WIC,"" Frank said. ""It just adds to the long list of services that have been cut the past two years."" This spike in demand at Maryhouse and other social service programs across the country comes as House Republicans want to cut WIC by 10% as part of the 2011 federal budget plan passed last week, despite objections from Democrats and WIC advocates. In addition to WIC, the GOP-controlled House also passed cuts to Planned Parenthood, arts programs and heating subsidies for low-income households. Senate Democrats are proposing their own cuts they say total about $41 billion, although those cuts are based on President Obama's 2011 budget, which hasn't been passed. They floated a plan on Thursday that goes beyond the $41 billion in cuts, but Republicans quickly responded that the proposal still doesn't cut deeply enough. Obama has threatened to veto any bill that undermines the ability of the United States ""to out-educate, out-build, and out-innovate the rest of the world."" Obama has made WIC a spending priority, and is asking Congress to increase funding for the nutritional program for 2012. A spending plan must be approved by March 4 to avoid a government shutdown. Even if the Democratic Senate and Obama agree to WIC cuts, WIC has been running a surplus in 2011, and that money could be used to fill any funding reduction. ""The funding level that was provided last year...turned out to be more than what's needed,"" explained Zoë Neuberger with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""Participation didn't increase as much as was expected,"" Neuberger said. ""Food prices ended up being lower than what was anticipated. And both because of the participation and lower than expected food costs, there are funds left over from 2010 that are available to be used."" One of the key reductions in food costs is the price of milk, which has declined by about a percentage point the past year. Milk makes up about 20% of WIC program expenditures. If WIC is cut, it would be the first time the program has ever been reduced solely because of ideological reasons, according to Neuberger. ""It's definitely been a very popular program...And there has been a very strong bipartisan commitment in the past to make sure nobody gets turned away,"" Neuberger said. ""The question going forward is whether that commitment will be adhered to.""","WIC has been running a surplus in 2011, and that money could be used to fill any funding reduction .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal transportation safety officials Wednesday issued an ""urgent"" recommendation calling for a redesign of a component on some Boeing 777 aircraft engines -- a component blamed for two major mishaps in the past year. The engines on this British Airways jet lost power as it prepared to land in London on January 17, 2008. National Transportation Safety Board investigators said the Rolls-Royce engine component played a role in the January 17, 2008, crash of a British Airways jet near London's Heathrow Airport. Both the plane's engines lost power as the plane approached the runway, and 13 people were injured in the resulting crash. Ten months later, on November 26, 2008, a Delta Air Lines Boeing 777 was in cruise flight over Montana when an engine lost power. That plane landed safely in Atlanta after pilots performed a procedure developed in response to the Heathrow crash. In both cases, the NTSB said, a build-up of ice on a fuel/oil heat exchanger restricted the flow of fuel to the Rolls-Royce engines, reducing power. ""With two of these rollback events occurring within a year, we believe that there is a high probability of something similar happening again,"" NTSB Acting Chairman Mark Rosenker said in a news release. The Federal Aviation Administration recently ordered operators of Boeing 777s that use the Rolls Royce engines to revise flight manuals to give pilots procedures to follow in certain cold weather conditions, outlining steps they should take if their jets experience a reduction of power. But the NTSB said Wednesday the FAA action does not go far enough. ""The procedure has worked and it has been effective in significantly reducing the likelihood [of an incident],"" said NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson. ""But that's not enough. We need a permanent fix."" While the emergency procedures work, they add to the complexity of flying the plane and require a descent, which could be hazardous if the plane is not at a sufficient altitude, the NTSB said. Some 56 aircraft in the U.S. fleet and a total of 228 worldwide are equipped with Rolls-Royce engines. But the NTSB stopped short of recommending the planes be grounded. Knudson said the safety board believes the new procedures will significantly address the problem until Rolls-Royce has a new component ready for installation. Rolls-Royce indicated it can have a new system ready within 12 months, the NTSB said. ""We are encouraged to see that Rolls-Royce is already working on a redesign, and we are confident that with the FAA and EASA [European Aviation Safety Agency] overseeing the process, this flight safety issue -- even one as complex as this -- will be successfully and expeditiously resolved,"" Rosenker said. The NTSB recommended that, once Rolls-Royce completes its redesign, the new system be installed on all affected Boeing 777's at their next maintenance check or within six months. A Rolls-Royce spokesman said: ""The report clearly states that the Rolls-Royce equipment on this flight met or exceeded all requirements. The report also highlights the emerging issue of ice build up in commercial 'long-cold-high' routes. This is an industry-wide issue which requires detailed research that is likely to shape future regulations and requirements."" ""This has been a serious matter for both Boeing, and the airlines who use the 777 with Rolls Royce engines,"" said Richard Quest, CNN's aviation correspondent . ""The development of a permanent mechanical fix will solve the problem. Until then pilots operating the plane will be on their guard for any signs of the problems re-occurring. That said, the plane remains safe to fly, otherwise it would have been grounded by the authorities.""","Safety Board urges quick fix for Boeing 777 engine problem .

"Rafael Villares is a talented Cuban artist who appears to work effortlessly in mediums such as painting and sculpture. But for years, he has had an even more ambitious project in mind, one that seems like a fantasy from a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel. ""The idea would be to follow in the footsteps of the first explorers to Cuba and photograph the northern and southern coasts to create one panoramic image,"" he said. ""It would be one horizon, so you can't tell if it's an island or a continent. It's a search to capture Cuba's geography in 2012."" Villares never attempted his journey though, and not just because of the immense logistical challenges and government restrictions. His biggest obstacle was there was zero funding available for the trip. While artists abound in Cuba, they, like everyone else, face constant shortages in materials and a United States economic embargo that complicates the sale of their work. But now, two years after scrapping his plans to travel and photograph the island, Villares has the $1,300 he needs for his journey. The funds came from an unexpected source, a website called Yagruma. Named for a tree native to Cuba, Yagruma is the first crowd-funding website aimed at helping artists finance projects in Cuba. ""Everyone's talking about Yagruma,"" Villares said. ""That's the fun part, how it's getting buzz among young artists who have ideas for projects but don't have the funds to do them."" On Yagruma, artists approved by the website's creators upload a sample of their work -- a challenge itself given the island's scarce and mostly dial-up Internet. Yagruma then publishes their work along with their biography, a description of their next project and a request for contributions. The artists typically wait about 30 days as donations trickle in. As with many crowd-funding sites, only projects that are fully financed receive Yagruma's backing. The website keeps 5% of the funds to cover operating costs. So far, Yagruma has financed five projects and has another 10 in various stages of fundraising. The projects range from a documentary on an iconic Cuban song to a stop-motion short film of a man being chased by scissors and a straight razor. Site creators say the artists they feature express themselves freely and represent the incredible variety of Cuba's independent art scene. ""The way people use Yagruma so far has exceeded my expectations,"" said Ubaldo Huerta, one of the site's co-creators along with fellow Cuban Hiram Centelles Rodriguez. ""I see people who understand how to use it perfectly and how to compete for funding, present a project to attract backers and very quickly learn."" Huerta and Rodriguez live in Spain but are drawn to the notion that the Internet can improve the lives of Cubans back home. An earlier site they collaborated on, El Revolico, is the closest thing Cuba has to Craigslist. Even though the site is blocked by the government, Cubans still find ways to access El Revolico so they can sell cars, houses and just about everything else. Huerta said he is concerned that Yagruma might also run afoul with authorities. ""In Cuba, everything in a way is mediated by the government, the cultural establishment,"" he said. ""We are more than happy to talk with the government if they show an interest in who we are, how the site works."" Yagruma, he said, is a rare example of what many Cubans on both sides of the Florida straits say they seek to accomplish: reconciliation. ""What I am hoping is to foster creativity in Cuba to create a bridge between Cubans like me in the diaspora and Cubans on the island,"" Huerta said. ""It costs us nothing to shell out $20-$30, and it goes a long way in Cuba."" From his small art studio in the apartment he shares with his relatives, Villares is already at work trying to stretch the funds he received from Yagruma. He is excited ""to see the whole country, travel all of Cuba -- not just know it from outside, but meet the fishermen, the farmers who live there, the out-of-the-way places ... all the places in Cuba that you don't even imagine."" Villares is hoping to begin traveling the island this summer, when the ocean is calmer. Until then, he researches the software and cameras he could use to create a sprawling panorama of the island. And when he finally completes the odyssey, Villares will upload his finished work to Yagruma, in the hopes of attracting more financing for Cuba's independent artists.","Because of the U.S. embargo, many young artists in Cuba aren't able to finance their work .

"GENEVA, Switzerland (CNN) -- The World Health Organization on Wednesday raised its pandemic alert to 5, its second-highest level, warning of widespread human infection from the swine flu outbreak that originated in Mexico. Patients wait at a hospital Wednesday in Mexico City. The swine flu outbreak began in Mexico. Dr. Margaret Chan, the U.N. agency's director-general, said the decision to raise the alert on the 6-point scale indicated that all countries should ""immediately"" activate pandemic preparedness plans. ""This change to a higher phase of alert is a signal to governments, to ministries of health and other ministries, to the pharm industry and the business community that certain actions now should be taken with increased urgency and at an accelerated pace,"" Chan said. The announcement came as the number of confirmed cases increased rapidly across the world. The WHO and national governments have confirmed 148 cases in nine countries. Most of those cases are in the United States, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 91 cases. The figures include seven deaths in Mexico and one in the United States. More than 2,700 other patients worldwide are believed to be suffering from the virus that government officials call by its technical name, 2009 H1N1. The first cases of the virus were detected in Mexico, where health officials suspect swine flu in more than 150 other deaths and roughly 2,500 illnesses. As of late Wednesday, 99 cases had been confirmed -- up from 26, Mexico's health secretary reported. An eighth fatality was also confirmed. iReport.com: ""Regular life"" in Mexico with masks . The additional cases and fatality were not immediately confirmed by WHO . Researchers do not know how the virus is jumping relatively easily from person to person, or why it's affecting what should be society's healthiest demographic. Many of the victims who have died in Mexico have been young and otherwise healthy. The outbreak has prompted Mexican authorities to order about 35,000 public venues in Mexico City to shut down and restrict restaurants to serving only take-out meals. All nonessential government offices and private business were ordered to close between May 1-5, with only skeletal staffing allowed when necessary, Mexico's health secretary announced Wednesday. Mexican officials said it was too soon to determine what kind of economic impact the decision would have on the country. Germany and Austria became the latest European countries to report swine flu on Wednesday, while the number of cases increased in the United Kingdom and Spain. Peru reported its first case late Wednesday. Yet Chan reiterated the WHO's recommendation not to close borders or restrict trade in response to the outbreak, saying the world ""is better prepared for an influenza pandemic than at any time"" in history.  Watch how the U.S. is preparing for the worst » . ""We need to maintain a level of calmness so that we will continue to manage this in a rational manner,"" she said, adding that pork is safe for consumption as long as it is cooked properly. President Obama downplayed the possibility of closing the U.S. border with Mexico, where the recent occurrence of the deadly virus began. ""It would be akin to closing the barn door after the horses are out,"" Obama said during his Wednesday evening news conference. Obama said he'll be looking to health officials for guidance on how to handle travel between the two countries. The $1.5 billion Obama requested from Congress to help fight the outbreaks will help health officials monitor and track the virus and replenish the supply of anti-viral drugs, he said.  Watch President Obama caution Americans on swine flu » . Swine influenza, or flu, is a contagious respiratory disease that affects pigs. When the flu spreads person to person, instead of from animals to humans, it can continue to mutate, making it harder to treat or fight, because people have no natural immunity. Symptoms include fever, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The WHO's ""Phases of Pandemic Alert,"" which has been in existence for five years, characterizes phase 5 as a human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region, signaling that a pandemic is imminent. The highest level, phase 6, is defined by community-level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region, according to the agency. About a quarter of the U.S. stockpile of anti-viral drugs will be distributed to states by Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said.  Watch how U.S. officials are reacting to the virus » . U.S. officials also are asking scientists whether additional measures to screen for flu symptoms were needed at U.S. ports of entry, she said. Already, customs officers have asked 49 people to submit to tests for the H1N1 virus, she said. Of those tests, 41 have been negatives and the remaining eight have not yet come back. Researchers in the United States have already taking steps to crack the genetic code of the virus behind the swine flu outbreak in order to produce a vaccine, U.S. officials said Wednesday. The U.S. government is distributing 25 percent of its stockpile of antiviral medications Tamiflu and Relenza to all states, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Wednesday. Health officials stress that the medications are effective only if taken in the early stages of the infection.  Learn more about swine flu and how to treat it » . The 91 confirmed cases in the United States includes the country's first swine flu fatality: a 23-month-old child visiting from Mexico who died Monday at a Houston, Texas, hospital. A U.S. Marine in California is the military's first suspected case of swine flu, and three military family members in San Diego have confirmed cases, the CDC said. As a precaution, the military is banning travel to Mexico for nonessential personnel. Mexican officials also said they believe they may have found ""patient zero"" -- the first case of the global outbreak -- in the small mountain village of La Gloria. Edgar Hernandez, 5, survived the earliest documented case of swine flu. He lives near a pig farm, though experts have not established a connection between that and his illness. Edgar has managed to bounce back from his symptoms and playfully credits ice cream for helping him feel better. In the United States, at least 74 elementary, junior high and high schools have closed across the country due to confirmed or probable cases of swine flu, the Department of Education said Wednesday. Another 30 schools have closed as a precautionary measure, Department of Education spokesman Massie Ritsch said. Governments around the world are scrambling to prevent further outbreak. Some countries, such as China and Russia, have banned pork imports from the United States and Mexico, though the WHO said the disease is not transmitted through eating or preparing pig meat. Several other countries, such as Japan and Indonesia, are using thermographic devices to test the temperature of passengers arriving from Mexico. Egypt reportedly is considering culling all pigs although there have been no reported cases of swine flu there. Common seasonal flu kills 250,000 to 500,000 people every year worldwide, far more than the current outbreak of swine flu. But there is a vaccine for seasonal flu.

"An actress on the Netflix series ""Orange is the New Black"" says her parents and older brother were deported while she was a teenager -- and now she's backing President Barack Obama's plans to overhaul the immigration system through an executive order. Diane Guerrero, who plays Maritza Ramos, a character she described as ""a tough Latina from the 'hood,"" on the show, discussed her ordeal in an interview Monday on CNN's ""New Day"" ""It is so difficult for some people to get documented and to get their papers and become legal, and my parents tried forever. And this system didn't offer relief for them,"" she told CNN. ""What I'm asking for is to create or find a solution for families."" Now a volunteer for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a nonprofit group that advocates for immigrants' rights, Guerrero also wrote about going through high school and college without her parents in a Los Angeles Times op-ed over the weekend. ""Keeping families together is a core American value,"" she wrote. ""Congress needs to provide a permanent, fair legislative solution, but in the meantime families are being destroyed every day, and the president should do everything in his power to provide the broadest relief possible now. Not one more family should be separated by deportation."" Guerrero, a U.S. citizen, described coming home as a 14-year-old high schooler to an empty house. ""Lights were on and dinner had been started, but my family wasn't there,"" she wrote in the op-ed. ""Neighbors broke the news that my parents had been taken away by immigration officers, and just like that, my stable family life was over."" She said her parents had tried to prepare her for the possibility that they could be deported -- but that through high school and college, phone calls and once-per-summer visits to visit her family in Colombia weren't enough. She said she relied on the goodwill of friends and neighbors to get her through high school and into college. Her older brother, meanwhile, was deported, while his daughter was still a toddler. ""She still had her mother, but in a single-parent household, she faced a lot of challenges,"" she wrote, adding that her niece is now in jail, ""living the reality that I act out on screen."" ""I realize the issues are complicated. But it's not just in the interest of immigrants to fix the system: It's in the interest of all Americans,"" Guerrero wrote. ""Children who grow up separated from their families often end up in foster care, or worse, in the juvenile justice system despite having parents who love them and would like to be able to care for them.""","'Orange is the New Black' actress Diane Guerrero says her parents were deported when she was 14 .

"(CNN)There is no evidence that anyone at the NFL saw or possessed a video showing Ray Rice punching his then-fiancée until it was made public, but the league should have known it needed to dig deeper into the incident, an external investigative report released Thursday concludes. The report wraps up an inquiry by former FBI Director Robert Mueller into how the NFL initially investigated the then-Baltimore Ravens running back's attack on Janay Palmer last February at the Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City. ""We concluded there was substantial information about the incident -- even without the in-elevator video -- indicating the need for a more thorough investigation,"" Mueller said in his report. ""The NFL should have done more with the information it had, and should have taken additional steps to obtain all available information about the February 15 incident."" The NFL asked for Mueller's report in September after a public outcry over NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's handling of Rice's discipline. ""While this investigation has now concluded, our focus on the underlying issues and our commitment to positive change remain as strong as ever,"" Goodell said in a written statement. ""We have all learned a great deal in the past months and expect to be judged by how we lead going forward on issues of domestic violence and sexual assault."" Here are some things we learned through the report: . No evidence of video at NFL office . In September, The Associated Press reported that a law enforcement official told one of its reporters that the source mailed a copy of a video from a surveillance camera inside an elevator at the now closed Revel casino showing Rice knocking out Palmer to a league executive in April. The report said a woman called from a league phone number to acknowledge receipt of the video. The report says more than 200 league employees were interviewed and found no evidence that happened. Among the employees questioned were the women whose ID badges indicated they were in the NFL office on April 9. All 188 said they made no phone call. ""Each denied having seen the in-elevator video or even hearing a rumor that an in-elevator video of the Rice incident had been received by the league before it appeared on (celebrity news website) TMZ on September 8,"" investigators said. Also questioned were people in the mailroom, and no one there could remember a package sent to Jeff Miller, the league's senior vice president of security. Multiple emails from high-level NFL executives indicate they had not seen the video before it was posted on TMZ, the report says. Ray Rice's attorney had copy of video on April 1 . The prosecutor's office in Atlantic County wanted to wait until after a grand jury heard the case in late March before releasing the video to Michael Diamondstein, Rice's attorney. Diamondstein had asked for a copy from the casino on February 20. He was told by the casino's lawyer that police said not to turn over any evidence while an investigation was ongoing. Later Diamondstein was referred to the prosecutor. Rice was indicted on March 27 on a third-degree aggravated assault charge. His lawyer received a copy of the video from the casino on April 1 and from the prosecutor days later as part of the process of discovery. The report says Diamondstein chatted about the video with Ravens President Richard Cass and the lawyer said it was ""terrible."" The two disagree precisely when the call took place and how much of what was on the video was discussed. Diamondstein told investigators that if the league had asked for a copy of the video, he would have provided it. That was one of the league's missteps identified in the report. Others included not contacting police officers who investigated the incident, not attempting to get videos from the casino or the prosecutors, and not following up with the Ravens to see if the team had information the league did not. ""Had the league undertaken a more substantial investigation, it may have gathered available information about the incident, possibly including the in-elevator video prior to its public release,"" the report says. Atlantic City Police called NFL in March . A private investigator who was working the case for the NFL had been in touch with the Atlantic City Police Department trying to get the arrest report and other documents. He was told twice the police wouldn't provide the information. He asked a supervisor in the records division, Ava Davenport, if he could get reports if he filed an Open Public Records Act request. She said everything in it would be redacted. On March 28, the day after Rice's indictment, someone using Davenport's work phone called the NFL office and spoke to an operator for 59 seconds. Police declined to discuss the nature of the call and the operator couldn't remember what was discussed. The call wasn't transferred, records showed. The incident was viewed live . A security officer at the casino watched Rice strike Palmer twice as it happened on a surveillance monitor. That employee called another security officer to the elevator. When a supervisor arrived Palmer couldn't remember what had happened. Two DVD copies of surveillance video were given to police that morning. The in-house copy of video was viewable by security workers for several days before access was restricted. One employee told Mueller's team as many as 40 people had access to the room where the video could be watched. Mueller calls investigation independent . Several media reports had called into question Mueller as lead investigator because his law firm has done work for the NFL. But Mueller writes he has never provided legal services to the league nor has any of his team. Mueller said he joined the WilmerHale firm in March 2014, years after the firm helped the league negotiate with two media groups. In the past four years, the firm has only provided advice on immigration issues. ""Placing these relationships in context, I am quite confident that the ties described above have in no way influenced the conduct of this investigation,"" he says. Recommendations . Mueller says: ""Our findings demonstrate the weaknesses inherent in the league's longstanding practice of deferring to the criminal justice system with respect to the investigation of facts and the imposition of discipline under the Personal Conduct Policy. Discipline should be imposed on the basis of the specific nature of the player's conduct, not solely or necessarily on the disposition of a criminal case."" He recommend the NFL establish an investigative team for domestic violence and sexual assault cases, that the league expand its security department with a special counsel and other personnel, and clarify policies that assured teams the league shared information. ""Investigations of domestic violence cases present unique challenges,"" the report says.","Report says league might have seen in-elevator video if it had done better investigation .

"What really happened to Michael Brown? We know a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, fatally shot the unarmed 18-year-old, but police and witnesses have given different accounts of what happened in the moments before the shooting. The confusion has fueled protests in Ferguson and, earlier in the week, strong police response in the streets of the St. Louis suburb. Here are five key questions about the incident: . How did it start? Brown and Dorian Johnson, 22, were walking in the middle of the street, en route to either Brown's grandmother's house (according to Brown's mother and grandmother) or to Johnson's house (according to Johnson), when a Ferguson police officer confronted them. Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, told the young men either ""Get the f*** on the sidewalk"" or ""Get the f*** out of the street,"" according to Johnson's accounts to CNN and other news outlets. The young men replied that they were ""not but a minute away from our destination, and we would shortly be out of the street,"" Johnson told CNN. The officer drove away but stopped and backed up, almost hitting the pair, Johnson said. He said he wasn't sure what prompted the officer to return. Johnson told MSNBC the officer said something to the effect of ""What'd you say?"" ""We were so close, almost inches away, that when he tried to open his door aggressively, the door ricocheted both off me and Big Mike's body and closed back on the officer,"" Johnson said. A caller to the St. Louis radio program The Dana Show, on Radio America, gave what she said was the officer's version of events. Her account accurately matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN. The caller, who identified herself only as ""Josie,"" said that Wilson told her that the two young men were walking in the street and he rolled down his window and told them to get out of the street. Was there a struggle? Yes. Everyone agrees on this point, and it's one of the few aspects of the shooting that police have attempted to detail, though the official explanation has spurred many questions they have yet to answer. The preliminary investigation showed that the officer tried to exit his vehicle, but Brown pushed him back into the car, ""where he physically assaulted the police officer"" and struggled over the officer's weapon, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said. A shot was fired inside the police car, Belmar said. After the incident, the officer was taken to an area hospital, where he was treated for a ""swollen face,"" according to Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson. In Josie's version, Wilson may have heard a call about a strong-arm robbery and saw the young men carrying something that might have been stolen cigars. According to Josie, when Wilson tried to get out of his car, Brown pushed him back in, and then punched the officer in the face. It was then that Wilson reached for his gun, Josie told the radio show. Brown grabbed Wilson's gun, and the officer pushed it away and the gun went off, Josie said. The stories don't jibe with at least three witness accounts. Johnson claims the officer grabbed Brown by his neck, and Brown tried to pull away, but the officer kept pulling Brown toward him, he said. The officer drew his weapon, and ""he said, 'I'll shoot you' or 'I'm going to shoot' "" and almost instantaneously fired his weapon, hitting Brown, Johnson said. Witness Tiffany Mitchell was picking up coworker Piaget Crenshaw for their jobs when she saw Brown and the officer ""tussling through the window."" Mitchell and Crenshaw said Brown appeared to be trying to pry himself from the officer's grasp. Brown had his hand on the police cruiser, trying to push himself away, Mitchell said. Was Brown armed? No. Again, this is undisputed. Every casing found at the scene came from the officer's gun, Belmar said, and witnesses say that after the officer initially fired, the two young men took off running. ""I saw the officer proceeding after my friend, Big Mike, with his gun drawn, and he fired a second shot, and that struck my friend, Big Mike,"" Johnson said. ""And at that time, he turned around with his hands up, beginning to tell the officer that he was unarmed and to tell him to stop shooting. But at that time, the officer was firing several more shots into my friend, and he hit the ground and died."" This matches Crenshaw's and Mitchell's story. Crenshaw told CNN that Brown got about 20 feet away from the police cruiser before the officer shot him again. ""The cop gets out of his vehicle shooting,"" Mitchell said. ""(Brown's) body jerked as if he was hit from behind, and he turned around, and he put his hands up. ... The cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground, and his face just smacked the concrete."" A private autopsy conducted for the Brown family showed that Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. Josie, recounting the officer's version of events, told the radio program that after the first shot went off inside the car, Brown and his friend started running, and Wilson pursued as protocol dictates. According to Josie, Wilson told the young men to freeze, and the pair turned around. The officer's account is that Brown started to taunt him, saying he wouldn't shoot him, and then rushed at the officer at full speed, Josie said. It was then that Wilson started firing, Josie said. She said that in the officer's opinion, Brown ""was on something."" According to her, the final shot hit Brown in the forehead, and he fell two or three feet in front of the officer. A new witness, Michael Brady, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday that Wilson fired at Brown after the teen ran about 20 feet. Brady ran out of his apartment to get a closer look. Seconds later, he saw Brown doubled over, cradling one arm and beginning to fall forward. He took a step or two towards the officer but did not charge him, Brady said. Wilson fired three to four more shots at him, he said. What were Brown and Johnson doing before the incident? On Friday, six days after the shooting, Ferguson police revealed that Brown was the ""primary suspect"" in the strong-arm robbery of a convenience store moments before he encountered police and was killed. A store surveillance video shows a man pushing a clerk before walking out the front door with a box of Swisher Sweets cigars worth $48.99, according to information released by police. The Brown family lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that the person in the video appears to be Michael Brown. Read the police reports . Johnson, who was with Brown when he was shot, will not face any criminal charges in connection with the store robbery because ""we have determined he committed no crime,"" Jackson said. Jackson initially said that the officer who shot Brown was responding to a call about the robbery. Later, Jackson revised that comment, saying the officer approached Brown not because of the robbery, but because he was ""walking down the middle of the street, blocking traffic."" Read more about the flash point in the Heartland at CNN.com/US . Why didn't police identify the officer right away? It took police six days to publicly identify Wilson. Police initially promised to release the officer's name but held off, saying they feared for his safety. On Friday, police revealed the officer as Wilson, 28, who is a six-year veteran of the department without any history of disciplinary action. Wilson is on paid administrative leave, Belmar said, and will have to undergo two psychological evaluations before returning to duty. Though the officer was promptly released from the hospital, Jackson said he spoke to him, and he was ""very shaken about what happened that day and the aftermath. ... He's hurt."" Brown's family and their attorneys were infuriated that police released Wilson's identity and allegations of Brown's role in the robbery on the same day. ""The prolonged release of the officer's name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies,"" the family and lawyers  said in a statement.

"(CNN)""That's the ugliest bird I've ever seen."" The statement doesn't so much roll off my tongue as it stumbles out of my mouth as I look at the scrappy tufts of feather on the leathery head of a marabou stork. Others on the boat mutter similar sentiments. ""It's one of the Ugly Five,"" says Amos, our captain and guide on an afternoon safari cruise at Moremi Game Reserve in Botswana's Okavango River Delta. His enthusiasm feels exaggerated for such a hideous bird. Safaris tend to focus on the so-called Big Five -- lions, leopards, buffalo, rhinos, elephants -- but the Ugly Five makes for a fun alternative for anyone who's already checked off the safari stars. The list runs like a cast call for the ""Lion King's"" least majestic animals: marabou stork, hyena, vulture, wildebeest and warthog. And we're here to meet them all. Marabou stork . The marabou stork doesn't just rely on its looks -- it's also got a scent thing going down. ""They can grow up to five feet long,"" says Amos as we get close enough to see the scabby-looking beak of one these large birds. ""And be glad it's not close enough that you can smell him."" Everyone, except our guide, cringes as the bird spreads its malodorous 12-foot wings and takes off from a tree, giving us a full view of its underbelly and wrinkly throat sack. The Okavango Delta is one of two breeding grounds for the marabou stork. During mating season, the birds are known to eat live prey, including adult flamingos. The stork also goes by the name of the ""undertaker bird"" in recognition of the grim but important role it plays in the Delta -- reducing diseases and cleaning up the ecosystem by devouring rotten carcasses. Hyena . One the next morning's bush walk, we get lucky in spotting a hyena. We're certainly luckier than the smelly dead animal it's devouring. ""Your nose is the strongest tracker of game,"" says Amos. Apparently, your ears are the second, but we're alerted to the hyena's presence not by its notorious cackling laugh but by the sound of the bones it's crunching. We peer over the brush to see a spotted hyena with its snout in the stomach of an impala. Before anyone can ask, our guide says: ""It probably didn't steal this meal from lions. Hyenas are very successful hunters."" The hyena registers low on the cuteness meter. This one couldn't get any more ugly unless it was covered in blood. Which it is. My friend Anja, disagrees, claiming that hyenas are so unattractive they're actually endearing. ""They're only ugly because they're villains in movies,"" she says. Showing me a photo of a hyena cub her sister took in South Africa's Kruger National Park, she adds, ""The babies are so cute!"" That's debatable, but they certainly get uglier with age. As we're watching, our hyena pulls its bloody face out of the carcass, revealing its elongated neck, hunched gait and dirty, scrappy fur. Vulture . With one of the strongest jaws in the animal world, hyenas don't leave much for scavengers. Even so, where there are carcasses, there are usually vultures. While the marabou is the only species of stork on the list, the entire vulture family can claim membership to the ugly club. Circling overhead in a flying ""kettle"" (unusual collective noun alert!), the vultures we see aren't too bad to look at. Their wings silhouette magnificently against the blue sky. The illusion is broken when a few fly down to compete with the hyena for impala meat, revealing that though they have the wings of an eagle, they have the face of Freddy Kruger. It's no surprise the bird's hooked beak and hunched stature have inspired a marvel comic villain. ""Their ugliness is efficient,"" says Amos. (He says that about all the Ugly Five.) The curved beak is effective in ripping meat, according to our guide. The vulture's ugliest feature, the featherless head and neck, is easy to keep clean after eating carrion. Logistically, it makes sense. Esthetically, it's the stuff of nightmares. Warthog . The warthog is another case of practicality over prettiness. These wild pigs are plagued with useful but unappealing warts on both sides of their faces, landing them firmly in the ugly crowd. The protuberances protect the faces of male warthogs when they fight, even if they do look like surgery gone wrong. Warthogs are plentiful in the Okavango Delta.  Anywhere out of scent-range from carnivores, we see warthog families digging for roots with their front knuckles. Together with warts, shaggy mohawks down their backs and uneven body hair, the warthog is the least appealing pig in the delta (although their roasted ribs are delicious.) They're shaped like torpedoes with pig noses. Their bodies seem disproportionately stocky in comparison to their skinny legs and short necks. As we're watching a mother and two babies, someone in our group steps on a twig and spooks them. We're treated to the beautiful sight of warthog butts with tails straight up in the air. Wildebeest . During an afternoon heading out from the Delta's Moremi Crossing resort in a mokoro dug-out canoe, we cross paths with the last of the Ugly Five: wildebeest. As we slosh from one end of the small herd to another, a dozen weary black faces with straggly manes stare us down, perhaps concerned we might try to eat them. Because they're one of the most populous safari animals -- and not much to look at -- many people don't bother to photograph them, says Amos. As the unpretty cousin of the more elegant eland and gazelle, the wildebeest is a peculiar genetic mishmash. It has the head of a buffalo, body of an antelope and tail of a shaggy horse. Its elongated face is connected to a dirty-looking neck fringe and features a mouth shaped, and used, like a lawnmower. Murky gray bodies decorated with black and white markings add to the unkempt appearance. ""Its ugliness is no problem for mating, they're practically blind,"" Amos laughs. Getting There . The only way to get to Moremi Crossing is by small plane, followed by a five-minute boat ride. The guided cruise, bush walk and mokoro rides are part of all-inclusive packages for guests. Accommodations include luxury tents, outdoor showers and nightly hippo serenades.

"A well-known candidate for Paraguay's presidency died in a helicopter crash while on the campaign trail, authorities said Sunday. Retired Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo died late Saturday night when the helicopter he was traveling in plunged to the ground in western Paraguay, officials said. He was 69. Investigators found the charred helicopter wreckage Sunday morning and discovered that Oviedo, his bodyguard and the chopper's pilot had perished, Paraguay's civil aviation authority said. READ RELATED: Neighbors pull envoys after Paraguay dumps president . While authorities said it was unclear what caused the crash, some supporters of Oviedo said the circumstances were suspicious. Oviedo's sudden death in the heart of campaign season sent shock waves across Paraguay's political landscape less than three months before the presidential vote. ""We will hire international experts in aerial accidents to investigate what happened in a clear and objective manner,"" Paraguayan President Federico Franco said in a written statement. READ RELATED: Paraguay gets cold shoulder from neighbors after impeaching president . Franco declared three days of national mourning in honor of Oviedo, describing him as a ""military hero"" and praising his role in the February 3, 1989, coup that ended military dictator Gen. Alfredo Stroessner's 35-year rule. In a Twitter post, the National Union of Ethical Citizens political party he founded described him as ""the father of democracy."" Oviedo was a controversial figure in Paraguay, beloved by his supporters and despised by enemies, some of whom accused him of trying to undemocratically seize power in the country. Oviedo first ran for president in 1998, but he was taken out of the running after a military tribunal sentenced him to 10 years in prison for his role in a 1996 coup attempt. A 2007 Paraguayan Supreme Court ruling overturned his sentence. Shortly afterward, he hit the campaign trail again, signing up to run in Paraguay's 2008 presidential election. In that election, he finished third, garnering 21% of votes. But that didn't stop him from signing up to run again this year. ""If they don't kill me, I am going to win the 2013 elections,"" Oviedo told Paraguay's La Nacion newspaper in 2011. The announcement of his death on the 24-year annivesary of the 1989 coup that he helped lead sparked suspicion among one of his top allies. ""It's too much of a coincidence,"" said Cesar Durand, a spokesman for Oviedo's party, in an interview with Paraguay's Radio Cardinal. ""We are not going to permit this to go unpunished. ... I have absolutely no doubt that this is a political crime,"" he said. Paraguay's Senate president described the circumstances of the accident as ""strange,"" but said the party would accept the results of the official investigation, the government-run IP Paraguay news agency reported.","Retired Gen.

"At gun stores from coast to coast, and on the Internet, they are known as ""exploding targets."" But the man who oversees Maryland's bomb squad has another name for them: Explosive Kits for Dummies. Amazingly simple to assemble -- just pour two powders into one container and shake -- the targets are a safe and fun way to enhance target shooting, manufacturers say. Shoot it with a bullet from a safe distance, and you'll be rewarded with a concussive blast and a cloud of smoke, indicating you've hit your target. But if you search YouTube for ""Tannerite"" -- the most popular brand -- and you'll find more than 100,000 videos depicting the use -- and more frequently, the misuse -- of the product. On-line videos show people in a veritable contest to see who can detonate the most explosives in the most innovative way, demolishing pumpkins and watermelons, dead cows and pigs, washing machines and refrigerators, old cars and trucks, Elmo dolls and even a trailer home. To heighten the impact, diehards mixed it with gasoline, diesel fuel or propane tanks, creating explosions that crater the land, trigger car alarms, and shaking nearby communities. In one video that is now an Internet staple, a Minnesota man in 2008 detonated 100 pounds of Tannerite in the dump box of an old dump truck, sending the truck aloft -- while rattling a nearby nuclear power plant and, inconveniently, the police department. The nuclear plant went into a short lockdown and the man later pleaded guilty to two felonies involving explosives. Last year, Maryland became the first state to regulate exploding targets, requiring users to be trained and licensed to handle explosives. Some California jurisdictions have also interpreted state law to restrict use of the targets. And last month, exploding targets got even more notoriety when the U.S. Forest Service banned the targets on its property in five western states (Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas) saying the targets ignited 16 fires on Forest Service lands coast-to-coast since January 2012.  The cost of extinguishing those fires: more than $33 million. Forest Service officials say they hope to extend the year-long ban, and extend it nationwide. And in March, the FBI distributed a bulletin to law enforcement agencies nationwide warning that exploding targets could be used ""as an explosive for illicit purposes by criminals and extremists"" and its components could be used to make IEDs. One state's decision . Maryland Chief Deputy State Fire Marshal Joseph Flanagan said he fought to regulate exploding targets after the product appeared on local gun store shelves. Gun stores were giving Maryland residents a ""false sense that it was OK to use,"" he said, even though customers unknowingly broke Maryland law preventing them from ""manufacturing"" explosives whenever they combined the targets' two ingredients. So Flangan pushed a bill to expand the definition of explosive to include ""two or more components"" when packaged together that create a bomb. The bill failed on its first two attempts, but passed in 2012 after a representative from the National Rifle Association signed a letter saying the NRA was taking ""no position"" on the bill. Gun rights advocates did not oppose the measure ""because there are so many other things that are more important to us, and it doesn't really involve guns,"" said John H. Josselyn, legislative vice president of Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore. ""We looked at it, considered the impact on our members and wrote it off as another feel-good issue by the left wing that has nothing better to do."" Josselyn said he remains ""philosophically"" opposed to the restrictions since ""we banned one more thing that wasn't causing a problem."" Flanagan acknowledges that exploding targets had not caused many problems in Maryland.  But, he said, as the products began appearing on local store shelves, Maryland wanted to be in front of the problem. ""This is a high explosive and it belongs in the category with other high explosives,"" Flanagan said. ""We're not going to wait for an incident to occur where this product is used, where it's just purchased off the shelf. We are not sorry for the action we took."" Fire marshals from several other states have sought Maryland's guidance as they contemplate similar regulations, he said. In Indiana this year, self-described ""very pro-gun"" Republican state Sen. Jim Merritt introduced a bill to require retailers to place Tannerite in locked displays, and to require that purchasers to be at least 18.  There are currently no age limits on its purchase. The bill died under the weight of legislative business, Merritt told CNN, although he may introduce it again. ""I considered this a homeland security issue, and I can envision this being a real problem for law enforcement someday,"" Merritt said. Few federal restrictions . Exploding targets consist of ammonium nitrate (an oxidizer) and aluminum powder (a fuel). But because neither component individually is explosive, they not regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). Once the components are mixed, the results is an explosive material and subject to ATF regulations. However, under federal law, individuals can manufacture explosives for their own personal, non-business use. There is no federal limit on the amount of explosives an individual can make. Federal law, in short, does not prohibit exploding targets. But, federal officials say, federal law does regulate the manufacture of explosive devices, and federal laws could be used to prosecute individuals who use the targets in the construction of explosive devices. The intent of the individual is a factor in determining legality, officials said. Some state and local governments have taken action against sports shooters, especially in cases in which they've mixed large volumes of the target ingredients. In the case of Brian Childs, the Minnesota man who shot at the 100 pounds of Tannerite in the dump truck, prosecutors viewed the truck not as a target, but as a bomb. ""It looks like they legally bought (the components). It was shipped to them by the Tannerite people,"" said Chris Schrader, assistant county attorney for Goodhue County. But when the components were mixed and placed in the dump truck, ""we looked at our definition of an explosive device and it definitely qualified,"" Schrader said. ""It was how they used it, which was enormously dangerous and ill-conceived,"" Childs said. ""It was enormously reckless how they were using it. They had no idea what they were doing and you can tell by their reaction (in a videotape of the incident)."" According to a police report, a large piece of metal flew over Childs head, even though he was 300 yards from the blast. Fire problem . Tannerite Sports, the Oregon-based manufacturer of the most popular brand of explosive targets, said it is being harmed by the widespread misuse of the product. And by people wrongly claiming that other products are ""Tannerite."" ""You can Google all day long and the first thing that will be popping up, people will be misusing our product and other products, other brands of binary exploding targets. It's a misuse,"" said Dena Woerner, a publicist for Tannerite Sports. ""Our produce was created to be used as a shot indicator. With Tannerite, you can see if you actually hit your target without having to walk down the range. And when you misuse a product, you could potentially be breaking the law."" The rampant misuse of exploding targets is a ""threat to our business,"" Woerner concedes, so much so that the company is now soliciting videos of people using the product as intended. ""If people get hurt they're going to be more regulations and restrictions. We want people to be able to have fun with the product ... if they keep misusing it, people may not have that liberty anymore."" But federal officials take issue with Tannerite's claims that their product cannot result in fires. At a press conference announcing the ban on exploding targets in certain national forests, it released a video showing a bale of hay catching fire after an exploding target was shot.  The target was Tannerite, said Forest Service spokesman Lawrence Lujan. Lujan said other brands also cause fires, and the Forest Service is likely to extend its ban to other regions. A big bang . At a farm on Maryland's Eastern Shore, bomb squad member Matt Wrenn takes aims a Winchester rifle at targets at a range bounded by soybean fields, woods and an earthen berm. He flawlessly shoots at a series of targets set up to demonstrate the fire marshal's concerns about exploding targets. First, a one-pound binary target sitting on a stump, as intended by the manufacturer. Then he flawlessly shoots at targets in front of a human silhouette, a watermelon, and finally, an old bomb squad protective suit. It shreds part of the suit, dislodging one of the protective plates. Looking at the damaged bomb suit, Flanagan says he has no reservations about restricting access to the targets.  He believes the targets are dangerous, even when used as intended. ""It (the explosive ingredients) are all in a kit. It's already made for me. I have instructions on how to do it. It's an explosive kit for dummies, and it's pretty easy to make."" Says his bomb squad commander, Jack Waldner, ""The fact of the matter is, this is recreational use of explosives by people who have not been trained.""","Videos proliferate of ""exploding targets""

"(CNN) -- Those probably were not UFOs that hovered over China recently, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology analyst said. The images of the UFOs have caused quite a stir in China and on blogs around the world. But many of the images appear to be faked with the software program Photoshop and the ones that were not faked seem to depict the launch of a Chinese ballistic missile, said Geoffrey Forden, an MIT weapons analyst. Forden, who also specializes in Russian and Chinese space systems, published his analysis on a blog called ""Arms Control Wonk."" In the analysis, Forden used scientific theories to examine the images of the flying object that he felt were not created with Photoshop. ""It seems to me that a DF-21 (missile) launch somewhere near Jiuquan and aimed at a point somewhere in the eastern Gobi desert is the most likely cause of this 'UFO'"", Forden wrote. Chinese officials have been looking into the reports about UFOs. They have said they were trying to determine whether the objects were private or military aircraft, rocket flares, reflection in the sky or something else. The first sighting occurred at Hangzhou's Xiaoshan Airport, in the eastern part of the country, according to the state-controlled Xinhua news agency. Eighteen flights were delayed or rerouted and operations shut down after twinkling lights were spotted above the terminal around 9 p.m. July 7, the agency said. According to Xinhua, speculation has centered on a private aircraft. The state-run China Daily quoted a source saying the object had a military connection. Purported photos of the unworldly object have appeared online, on YouTube and on television news shows. Meanwhile, The Shanghai Daily reported a UFO appeared above the city of Chongqing a day later.","Some have said they saw UFOs over China recently .

"He was a big boy. A very, very big boy. In fact, the Dreadnoughtus schrani dinosaur unveiled Thursday was one of the biggest -- if not THE biggest -- land animal ever to grace the Earth. Experts estimate that back in its day -- the Upper Cretaceous period, approximately 77 million years ago -- this giant measured 85 feet long and weighed about 65 tons. No wonder, then, paleontologists picked a first name that breaks down to ""fear nothing."" (The second name honors benefactor and tech entrepreneur Adam Schran.) You wouldn't be scared, either, if you towered over every creature in sight, could smash most anything with your whip-like tail and could smoosh most anything with your colossal feet. ""Dreadnoughtus schrani was astoundingly huge,"" said Kenneth Lacovara, the lead author of the report published in Scientific Reports, as quoted on his school Drexel University's website. ""It weighed as much as a dozen African elephants or more than seven T. rex."" The fossilized remains of this Dreadnoughtus were unearthed recently in Argentina's southwestern Patagonia. 8 places for fantastic fossil finds . And to think the massive dinosaur pieced together by Lacovara's team was still growing up, according to expert analysis. It's hard to say how much bigger this or other Dreadnoughtus may have gotten had it fully matured. Nor, without a time machine, can one quickly determine whether this new species was bigger than fellow titanosaurs such as the similarly gargantuan Argentinosaurus. That's mostly because other finds like these are relatively incomplete, forcing paleontologists to make estimates based off a bone or two here and there. ""Titanosaurs are a remarkable group of dinosaurs, with species ranging from the weight of a cow to the weight of a sperm whale or more,"" said Matthew Lamanna, a Carnegie Museum of Natural History scholar who was part of the team, in the Drexel piece. ""But the biggest dinosaurs have remained a mystery because, in almost all cases, their fossils are very incomplete."" Not so with the new Dreadnoughtus specimen, which is another big reason -- big being the operative word for everything about this creature -- it's so special. Those who excavated the sometimes snow-covered terrain not far from Antarctica were able to locate more than 70% of the Dreadnoughtus' bones, including part of a jaw. Compare that to maybe 3% to 27% for other dinosaur finds of its kind. Lacovara characterized the discovery as ""by far the best example we have of any of the most giant creatures to ever walk the planet."" As heavy as 14 elephants, as long as 2 tractor trailers: Meet Mr. Titanosaur . And it's not like the scientists unearthed little chicken bones. A picture Lacovara posted to Twitter showed a woman next to one of Dreadnoughtus' scapulas, or shoulder blades, both roughly the same size. Its humerus, or upper arm, bone was taller than the Drexel University professor. A neck vertebra measured about 3 feet in diameter. All these things -- from fossils of large bones to a single tooth, from part of a jaw to toes and a claw -- coupled with digital technology could help to learn a great deal about the Dreadnoughtus and other titanosaurs' lived in their era, beyond the fact it had a 37-foot-long neck and 30-foot-long tail. One thing that it would have had to do, to get this big, is eat. A lot. (And it was all plants, proving your mom right that veggies can make you big and strong.) Lacovara thinks the Dreadnoughtus must have had ""a life-long obsession with eating,"" perhaps spending all its waking existence chomping leaves from giant tree after giant tree. He said, ""Every day is about taking in enough calories to nourish this house-sized body.""

"Beijing, China (CNN)The son of kung fu movie star Jackie Chan was convicted on a drug charge and sentenced to six months in prison in a Beijing court on Friday. Jaycee Chan, who pleaded guilty to ""hosting others to take drugs,"" was also fined 2,000 yuan ($320), announced the Dongcheng District People's Court. Wearing a black sweatshirt and blue pants, the 32-year-old Chan -- who is an actor like his father -- bowed to the judge and prosecutor after the 90-minute trial. ""I committed a crime and deserve to be punished,"" the court's official microblog quoted him as saying. ""It doesn't mean I have received mercy and forgiveness -- I hope to earn them with my future actions."" Reminding him to ""return to the right path"" and ""establish a healthy public image,"" the prosecutor cited Chan's cooperation with police as a basis for leniency, according to the court. The Hong Kong native was arrested in Beijing last summer along with a Taiwanese actor, amid a government crackdown on celebrity drug offenders. After both men tested positive for marijuana, police found more than 100 grams of the drug after searching Chan's apartment. Although he did not attend the trial, Jackie Chan -- who has starred in Hollywood blockbusters like ""Rush Hour"" and was named an anti-drugs ambassador in China in 2009 -- had expressed anger and disappointment in his son in media interviews. ""I failed to discipline him -- now the state is helping me discipline him and make him get rid all the bad habits,"" the elder Chan, 60, told the state-run Xinhua news agency last month, while denying his son had received special treatment in jail. The younger Chan's case has put a spotlight on the Chinese capital's intensifying anti-drugs campaign. By mid-November, the authorities had detained almost 10,000 people for using drugs, nearly double the previous year's figure. Announcing the numbers, a top anti-narcotics official in Beijing emphasized the government's ""zero-tolerance"" stance on celebrity offenders due to the impact of their behavior on the youth. Last August, dozens of management agencies representing actors and singers signed an agreement with Beijing authorities, banning drug use from the entertainment industry and pledging to fire any artists who break the law.

"Joe Clancy, the interim director of the U.S. Secret Service, said that the agency has been ""severely damaged in recent years by failures"" and explained some key mistakes made by the Secret Service when a fence jumper was able to run inside the White House two months ago. In his appearance before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, Clancy, who was tapped to lead the agency last month, also laid out protocols the Secret Service is trying to improve in the wake of the fence jumper and other problems in the past few years. ""I openly acknowledge that a failure of this magnitude, especially in light of other recent incidents, requires immediate action and longer term reform,"" he said. His appearance comes a week after the Department of Homeland Security published a report revealing failures in training, equipment and communications at the agency. Clancy said when the jumper, Omar Gonzalez, started to scale the fence, officers nearby outside the barrier started shouting verbal commands before sprinting over and coming ""about an arm's length or two arms' lengths short of reaching him"" before he breached the fence. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tennessee, joked that Gonzalez ""got further in the White House than some of my Republican colleagues have ever gotten."" He asked if a moat would be effective in stopping future White House jumpers. ""Sir, it may be,"" Clancy replied, but added the Secret Service tries to recognize the accessibility and historic nature of the White House. Their first step, Clancy continued, is working with the National Park Service to ""do something with the fence,"" including possibly making it taller. In the short term, Clancy said a bike rack now sits in front of the fence to provide one extra obstacle. Pressed on whether anyone at the agency was punished for violating protocol in the incident, Clancy said ""this was not an intentional violation of the code"" and no discipline was given. Clancy was chosen for the job after former Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in the wake of the fence jumping incident as well as a string of controversies involving the agency in recent years. One of those included a shooting incident that happened on November 11, 2011, in which it took days for the Secret Service to confirm that there were, in fact, evidence of bullet impacts on the White house faÃ§ade. Clancy said in his remarks that there are new fixes to improve and better enforce policies regarding those in close contact with the president. This comes after Obama was -- unknowingly -- in an elevator with an armed contractor at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta back in September. After working under former President George W. Bush, Clancy worked with the President and first lady Michelle Obama on outlining a plan of action to protect their daughters. He then entered the private sector as executive director of Comcast Cable Security. He left after three years for his current role as the Secret Service's interim director.","Joe Clancy promises a bottom-to-top assessment of the troubled agency .

"HealthCare.gov, the problem-plagued federal online site for signing up for insurance under Obamacare, will go down for extended maintenance on Friday night and overnight ahead of Saturday's deadline to have it working for most people, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said. The Obamacare question: Can the website handle the volume? The work is set to last from 9 p.m. ET Friday until 8 a.m. ET Saturday. It's not the first time the website has gone down; the administration has frequently done regular weekend maintenance, usually on Sunday mornings. During the maintenance checks, the website's application and enrollment system are unavailable, officials said. But one section of the website that verifies income and citizenship information, known as the Data Services Hub, will function as normal, according to officials. ""We will be making upgrades to the system that will require more than our usual four hours to complete. We've done this on occasion in the past,"" a CMS official told CNN. The administration is racing toward Saturday's self-imposed deadline to get the site up and running as intended. For weeks, President Barack Obama and other officials have been saying a ""vast majority"" of people will start having a better experience on the federal site by November 30. It faced intense scrutiny after its botched launch on October 1, as users frequently faced crashes, error messages and delays when trying to shop or sign up for insurance. Multiple officials, however, have repeatedly said the website won't be perfect by Saturday, and some problems may remain. WH: Enroll in Obamacare, but not too fast . On the eve of the deadline, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius advised users to shop on the website during ""off-peak hours,"" which she described as ""mornings/nights/weekends"" in a blog post for Huffington Post. Officials fear another huge surge in volume that the site can't handle, which is what occurred around its launch in October. HealthCare.gov was originally planned to handle 50,000 concurrent users, and will reach that capacity by Saturday, a White House official said. However, big spikes in traffic -- such as the 200,000 who tried to get on at the same time on October 1 -- would cause users to go into a queue to receive e-mails advising them when to return, the official noted.

"(CNN)North Korea has expressed regret over the killing of four Chinese citizens by an army deserter near the China-North Korea border,  China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday. The runaway soldier shot four Chinese citizens after a robbery attempt in late December in Helong, a city near the Tumen River that divides the two countries. China's foreign ministry spokesperson said North Korea voiced regret over the incident after China lodged a formal diplomatic complaint against them on Monday. ""The DPRK side expressed its regret that such incident happened, and conveyed its sympathy to the family of the victims,"" said Hong Lei, spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foriegn Affairs in a press conference. The defector was shot by the Chinese police in a manhunt operation, and has died from injuries suffered during his capture according to the ministry. He added that the incident is being handled as an individual criminal case. There have been previous reports of runaway North Korean soldiers and citizens attempting robbery in search of food. A restaurant owner who lives in Dandong, another city bordering North Korea, recalled a harrowing incident in early 2013. ""One night, I heard a dog barking outside, so I got up to check what was going on. In the dim lighting, I saw a man dressed like a North Korean soldier stealing things from my restaurant,"" the unnamed owner was quoted in The Global Times. ""I yelled at him and he held up his gun as if he was ready to shoot. I was terrified and ran back to my room. He stole some meat and fled by speedboat."" In most cases, intruding soldiers were after food, and do not have the intention to harm people, making it rare that such violent cases would occur, reported the Chinese state-run newspaper. Thousands of North Koreans have tried to flee the country in hopes to escape the totalitarian regime. However, China has a uniform policy for sending defectors back to North Korea, ruling them as ""illegal economic migrants.""

"Mourners sat on mud floors at a village in India where two teen girls were gang-raped and then found hanging from a mango tree. They wailed and talked of fears of more attacks. The assault on the cousins, ages 14 and 16, sparked outrage in the community in Uttar Pradesh state. Villagers streamed into the homes of the girls' relatives, weeping behind their customary veils. The mother of one of the girls said her daughter wanted to become a doctor to escape grinding poverty. The attackers, she said, deserved the same fate that befell her daughter. ""Hang them in public,"" she said. CNN cannot identify the relatives or victims under Indian law. In the northern village where the attack occurred, crowds surrounded the girls for hours after their bodies were found Wednesday. They accused authorities of siding with the suspects and blocked them from taking the girls down from their nooses unless arrests are made. Authorities arrested five men -- three brothers and two police officers -- who are facing rape and murder charges, said R.K.S. Rathore, a senior police officer. In addition, the officers face charges of conspiracy in the crime and negligence of duty after villagers accused them of failing to respond when they first pinpointed the suspects.

"(CNN)Civil rights leader Al Sharpton sharply denounced an extensive New York Times report that he and his companies are subject to $4.5 million in current state and federal tax liens. The MSNBC host said in a press conference Wednesday that the $4.5 million was the original figure he was ordered to pay back in 2008, but that he has been making regular payments since then and the amount is now less. Sharpton did not give the outstanding balance owed by him and his for-profit companies --Raw Talent and Revals Communications. Rather, he focused his remarks on how much money his nonprofit group, the National Action Network, has paid back. The liens against that organization, however, were not lumped into the $4.5 million figure reported by the Times. The Times reported that Sharpton is still liable for personal federal tax liens of more than $3 million, and state tax liens of $777,657. The companies owe another $717,329 on state and federal tax liens. But Sharpton argued that it wasn't possible that he still owed $4.5 million. ""If we owed $4.5 million in '08 then how could we owe this now, unless you're saying that everybody just went to sleep on this and just gave us a pass, which is ridiculous,"" he said. Sharpton has been a regular face in New York and Washington political circles. The report points out that President Barack Obama has raised money for Sharpton's group, and that Sharpton attended the recent announcement that Loretta Lynch would be the White House's pick to be the next Attorney General. Sharpton's former aide Rachel Noerdlinger is also adviser to the wife of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Chirlane McCray. Sharpton argued that he and the National Action Network could feasibly each pay off their respective balances in one day, but could not yet afford to pay the penalties and interest. Still, he said, it is ""absolutely inaccurate"" that he and his organization collectively owe $4.5 million--which is how much the Times said that he and his for-profit businesses owe. His press conference came as his group prepares for the grand jury decision regarding police officer Darren Wilson to be announced in Ferguson, Missouri as soon as this week. Politics, he argued, was at the heart of negative stories about him in the press. ""Every time there's a Sean Bell or a Ferguson or a Trayvon Martin, we go through my taxes. It's the same agreement y'all. It's the same thing we announced in '09. It is the same thing we've been paying every month,"" he said.","A New York Times report says that Rev.

""But in a pinch, there are things you can use at home."" You just have to pick carefully and learn a little bit from the past. People have been using substances like olive oil, yogurt, vinegar, honey and aloe for skin care for ages, Day said, and now there are scientific studies that explain why they work. We asked Day, who has a few DIY recipes of her own in her book, ""Forget the Facelift,""  to guide us through the ""dos and don'ts"" of homemade beauty treatments. Think different . Here are some of Day's favorite pantry beauty ingredients. HoneyOne of Day's go-to products is honey. ""Honey is published widely in medical literature for its use on wounds and diabetic sores,"" she said. It is antiseptic and creates a barrier on wounds that's breathable, like skin, she said. Honey also helps preserve homemade salves, so you can use them for more than one application. She includes honey in her recipes for acne treatment, eye de-puffing and exfoliating scrubs. It's excellent for treating eczema, she said. AloeAloe, like honey, is great for treating wounds, Day said, and other skin irritations. It is anti-inflammatory, she said, so it's great for the pain associated with burns and poison ivy. Just pop off a piece of an aloe house plant and rub it directly on your irritated skin, she said. ""But it can sting when you first put it on the skin, so you have to be a little patient that way,"" she said. OilsOlive oil and coconut oil are Day's favorites for home hydration. They are gentle on the skin, she said, and good for treating irritation. A little bit of these oils massaged gently around the eyes can help hydrate wrinkly skin under the eyes, but take care not to get it in your eyes, she said. Olive oil can even be used to effectively clean oily skin -- and is often used as a binder for sugar or salt scrubs. For silky, shiny, smooth hair, Day recommends putting coconut oil in your hair, letting it soak in for a bit, then massaging in some shampoo before rinsing. If you shampoo after you've got water on your oil-soaked hair, it will be greasy for days, she said. ExfoliantsSalt and sugar are excellent exfoliants, Day said. Baking soda, as well, can be used as a fine-grained exfoliant, and may have antiseptic and brightening qualities as well, Day said. It's simple to add salt, sugar or baking soda to any cleanser you already have and make it a scrub. Dissolved epsom salts can also exfoliate the skin when used in high concentration. ""Epsom salts are an all-purpose type of thing,"" she said. ""Depending on the concentration, you can use it for everything from cleaning your furniture to get the calluses off your feet to help soothe your skin."" It can help dry out a poison ivy rash if you use a small amount of Epsom salt in a bath, she said. TeaIf you want to get antioxidants on your skin, use tea, rather than the often-suggested berries, Day said. ""You can put blueberries on your face, but that will just stain your skin and probably you won't get enough of the blueberry's antioxidant effect to make a difference,"" she said. Steeped tea bags can effectively de-puff your eyes by themselves or strongly brewed tea can add antioxidant treatment to cucumber slices. ""White tea has the highest levels of antioxidants and caffeine, so that would be my preferred one for the face,"" she said. YogurtSome DIY facial treatment recipes use milk for wrinkle-banishing properties, but Day said it's silly. Milk can actually spoil on your skin, and it's not strong enough to deliver any lactic acid, she said. ""It won't work,"" she said, ""and it's expensive."" Instead, Day said, reach for the yogurt. In a mask, yogurt can deliver enough lactic acid to actually treat certain skin conditions. Think twice . Here are some ingredients Days says to approach with caution, or consider other options. VinegarPlain old white vinegar has historically been used as a deodorant, and it does stop body odor, Day said. But it has a major drawback: It stinks. ""It's killing the yeast and certain bacteria,"" that can make you smell bad, she said, ""but then you smell like vinegar."" Adding essential oil to vinegar helps, but does not eliminate the salad smell entirely, she said. As for making your hair shiny -- another often-suggested use --  ""it might have an effect on the hair cuticle, closing it,"" she said, ""but I don't know that I would use it in the hair."" After all, coconut oil works better, she said. Egg whitesEgg whites can provide a temporary tightening effect, a little relief for oily skin, Day said. But they come with a risk. ""You have to be careful with the egg white mask because egg whites sometimes have salmonella, and if you end up ingesting it by accident, you can actually get salmonella,"" she said. ""So these days, unless you know the source of the eggs, I would be very careful with that one."" SpicesIf a DIY facial scrub recipe calls for cinnamon, use it at your own risk, Day said. ""I think that would be irritating. You wouldn't get enough of a concentration of cinnamon and you can probably even get blisters,"" she said. ""It's a spice. If you put pepper on your skin, you can burn your skin."" But your skin can benefit from spices in your food, she said. Turmeric is anti-inflammatory, she said, and she often suggests adding it to meals. ""But it will stain your skin orange and you won't get enough absorption from using it on your skin to get the benefit,"" she said. ""Over-the-counter products that contain turmeric use turmeric extract, and those are better on the skin."" CitrusCitrus fruits, like lemons, can irritate skin, Day said. So if you're looking at a beauty recipe that calls for rubbing orange juice on your face or lemon wedges on your lips, stop reading. (Lips don't have oil glands, so they're especially sensitive,"" Day said.) ""Lemons have a chemical called psoralen, and the psoralen makes you exquisitely sensitive to light. It activates in about 10 to 15 minutes, and it takes about 24 hours to wear off. So if you do that, and go out in the sun, you can actually blister,"" Day said. ""I see it on people at the beach if they're having a Corona or a margarita,"" she said. ""Because they squeeze the lemon and get a rash on the back of their hand. It's the splatter pattern of how they squeezed the lemon, and the sunburn effect."" Hydrogen peroxideLike lemons, peroxide is often suggested as a home remedy for lightening hair color. But Day warns against it. ""It can bleach, but it can irritate,"" she said. ""Peroxide is toxic to skin cells. So if you have a wound and you keep putting hydrogen peroxide on it, it won't heal."" Only use it on the first day of your injury to clean a cut or a wound, she advised.","Honey, olive oil and tea are great pantry products for your skin, dermatologist Doris Day says .

"The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan has filed what it is calling a ""first-of-its-kind"" lawsuit against the state, its Department of Education and one Detroit-area school district for allegedly failing to teach students to read at grade level, as mandated by state law and its constitution. ""What's unique about this is that we're focusing in on literacy and the right to read"" Michigan ACLU Executive Director Kary L. Moss said of the complaint filed last week in state court. ""Literacy is the gateway to all other knowledge."" The suit names the Highland Park school district as a defendant, and it seeks to have the state and school district enforce a state law requiring that ""a pupil who does not score satisfactorily on the 4th or 7th grade reading test shall be provided special assistance reasonably expected to enable the pupil to bring his or her reading skills to grade level within 12 months."" Filed as a class action on behalf of eight students who, the ACLU said, represent nearly 1,000 students in the district, the lawsuit cites individual cases of students struggling with basic literacy. One of the student plaintiffs reportedly failed the state's standardized tests in his fourth, fifth and sixth grade years without receiving ""any specialized reading intervention in 4th or 5th grade,"" the lawsuit says. Another student plaintiff has, according to the suit, attended Highland Park schools since first grade and after completing eighth grade earlier this year ""his reading proficiency level is appropriate for the 2nd or 3rd grade."" Highland Park is one of the worst performing school districts in Michigan, according to the state Department of Education, and its high school currently ranks in the bottom 1% statewide. ""No case ever filed anywhere in the U.S. has addressed a school system in such dire straits."" said attorney Mark Rosenbaum, a member of the Michigan ACLU legal team. ""The Highland Park School District is among the lowest achieving school districts in the nation, let alone Michigan,"" Rosenbaum added in an ACLU news release. On January 27, less than a month into his first term, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder appointed the first of two emergency managers to take action in the Highland Park school district. Though unable to comment directly on the suit, Sara Wurfel, spokeswoman for Snyder, said, ""Everything we have done and are doing is to ensure that the kids of Highland Park schools get the education they need and deserve."" A statement released Monday by the Michigan Department of Education said: ""The Michigan Department of Education has been counseled by our state Attorney's General office to not comment on pending litigation."" No one in the office of state Attorney General Bill Schuette could be reached for comment. For Moss and the ACLU, the situation and the lawsuit have national significance. ""If kids aren't reading, nothing else is going to come,"" Moss said. ""If we're not preparing our children, there is no way our economy can recover.""","Suit: An 8th-grade plaintiff has reading proficiency ""appropriate for the 2nd or 3rd grade""

"Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has signed a binding agreement to buy the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion from the Sterling family trust, a source familiar with the situation told CNN on Thursday night. A second source, who was familiar with the negotiations, confirmed the terms to CNN. The sale, negotiated by Shelly Sterling -- co-owner with estranged husband Donald Sterling -- will have to be approved at a NBA Board of Governors meeting. It was unclear whether a meeting set for Tuesday will go on, given Thursday's developments. And the sale still may have to be approved by Donald Sterling, according to earlier comments by his attorney. Maxwell Blecher told CNN earlier that his client would have to consent to a sale and wants to be vindicated by the NBA, which is in the process of terminating the Sterlings' ownership in the team for racist remarks Sterling made in an audio recording released online in April. The NBA has damaged Sterling's reputation, Blecher claimed in a lengthy interview with CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""They know he is not a racist,"" he said. Blecher said Sterling is troubled by the charges of racism. He thinks of himself as an exemplary owner with a 33-year history of supporting the African-American community, Blecher said. ""He wants to be vindicated. He doesn't want his tombstone to say, 'Here lies Donald Sterling, racist.' And the NBA has the power to make that right,"" Blecher said, without saying what Sterling wants the league to do. CNN reached out to Blecher for comment on news of the sale, but didn't immediately hear back. Blecher said earlier that Sterling had no interest in selling the team, rather than passing it down to his heirs. When reminded that Sterling would make a huge profit on a sale, even after capital gains taxes, Blecher it should have been the billionaire businessman's decision when to part with the team. It's not about money, he said. In April, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling, fined him $2.5 million and prompted the league's other 29 owners to begin proceeding to strip the longtime owner and his wife of the team. Sterling is considering suing the NBA if he doesn't get the resolution he wants. Blecher said they weren't in a rush to file the lawsuit and were waiting in part in deference to Shelly Sterling as she negotiated the sale. Biggest NBA deal ever . Ballmer is worth $20 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Another source said Ballmer's offer earlier Thursday was $1.8 billion and Shelly Sterling was hoping to get a price that ""started with a two."" A group that included media moguls David Geffen and Oprah Winfrey also made a bid of $1.6 billion, the source told CNN. If the deal goes through, it would be the largest sum paid for an NBA franchise. Last month, the Milwaukee Bucks, a bad team in a small television market, sold for $550 million. But the Clippers are in the second-largest market in the league, albeit one they share with the Los Angeles Lakers, one of the most popular teams in professional sports. The Clippers, however, have been more successful in recent seasons, including this one that ended in the second round of the NBA playoffs. They also have stars Blake Griffin and Chris Paul. And their TV contract reportedly will expire in 2016 and could mean billions to the owner. The purchase would have to be approved by 75% of the NBA's 30 owners. Last year they denied a sale to a group that included Ballmer that would have resulted in the Kings moving to Seattle, after the league's relocation committee recommended keeping the team in Sacramento. Ballmer, who attended several Clippers playoff games, told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month he would not move the team from Los Angeles. Donald Sterling has been the controlling owner of the Clippers since buying the team in 1981 for $12 million. Sterling's wife: We're just business partners .

"Fred Phelps -- the founding pastor of a Kansas church known for its virulently anti-gay protests at public events, including military funerals -- has died, the church said Thursday. The 84-year-old died of natural causes at 11:15 p.m. Wednesday, according to church spokesman Steve Drain. Phelps founded Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, in 1955 and molded it in his fire-and-brimstone image. Many members of the small congregation are related to Phelps through blood or marriage. In a statement Thursday, the church chided the ""world-wide media"" for ""gleefully anticipating the death."" ""God forbid, if every little soul at the Westboro Baptist Church were to die at this instant, or to turn from serving the true and living God, it would not change one thing about the judgments of God that await this deeply corrupted nation and world."" According to Westboro, the church has picketed more than 53,000 events, ranging from Lady Gaga concerts to funerals for slain U.S. soldiers. Typically, a dozen or so church members -- including small children -- will brandish signs that say ""God Hates Fags"" and ""Thank God for Dead Soldiers."" Phelps was often called ""the most hated man in America,"" a label he seemed to relish. ""If I had nobody mad at me,"" he told the Wichita Eagle in 2006, ""what right would I have to claim that I was preaching the Gospel?"" Under Phelps' leadership, Westboro members have preached that every calamity, from natural disasters to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, is God's punishment for the country's acceptance of homosexuality. Phelps had advocated for gays and lesbians to be put to death. ""Fred Phelps will not be missed by the LGBT community, people with HIV/AIDS and the millions of decent people across the world who found what he and his followers do deeply hurtful and offensive,"" the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force said in a statement. Phelps began his anti-gay protests in Wichita in 1991 after complaining that the city refused to stop gay activities in a public park. He rose to national notoriety in 1998, when Westboro members picketed at the funeral of Matthew Shepard, a Wyoming man who was tortured and murdered because he was gay. Phelps and his church carried signs that said Shepard was rotting in hell. The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Westboro Baptist Church ""arguably the most obnoxious and rabid hate group in America."" In 2011, the Supreme Court upheld Westboro's right to picket military funerals on free speech grounds. Congress and several states, though, have passed laws aimed at keeping church members at a distance from funerals. In 2013, more than 367,000 petitioners called on the White House to legally recognize Westboro Baptist Church as a hate group. The White House called Westboro's protests ""reprehensible"" but said that ""as a matter of practice, the federal government doesn't maintain a list of hate groups."" Anti-gay preacher once fought for civil rights . Born in Meridian, Mississippi, on November 29, 1929, Phelps had his sights set on West Point before he attended a Methodist revival. He said the sermon inspired him to enter the ministry. ""I felt the call, as they say, and it was powerful,""  Phelps told the Topeka Capital-Journal in 1994. ""The God of glory appeared."" Later, Phelps was ordained by a Southern Baptist church in Utah. He bounced around several Christian colleges as his preaching and his theology took a hard right turn. A Time magazine article from 1951 describes Phelps as a ""craggy-faced engineering student"" who harangued fellow students about the dangers of promiscuity and profanity. Tim Miller, a professor of religious history at the University of Kansas who has studied Westboro Baptist Church, said Phelps liked to consider himself a ""primitive Baptist preacher who held to the old ways."" Despite its ""Baptist"" name, Westboro is not affiliated with any larger church denomination. Most Christians criticize the congregation's harsh anti-gay rhetoric and penchant for pursuing the limelight at inappropriate moments. Phelps married his wife, Marge, who survives him, in 1952. The couple moved to Topeka on May 14, 1954, the day the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision Brown v. Board of Education, which desegregated public schools. Phelps interpreted that as a sign and soon began a law career that centered on civil rights, winning awards for his work and praise from local leaders. ""Most blacks -- that's who they went to,"" the Rev. Ben Scott, president of the NAACP's Topeka branch, told CNN in 2010. ""I don't know if he was cheaper or if he had that stick-to-it-ness, but Fred didn't lose many back then."" Phelps was disbarred from practicing law in state courts, however, after being accused of badgering a witness and making false claims in court affidavits. The Kansas Supreme Court said that Phelps ""has little regard for the ethics of his profession."" Phelps surrendered his license to practice law in federal courts in 1989, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal, after nine U.S. District Court judges filed disciplinary complaints against him. Most of the members of Phelps' Westboro Baptist Church are members of his large family. Phelps has 13 children; 11 are attorneys. One son, Nathan, is estranged from his father and from organized religion. He is an atheist. Nathan Phelps posted a Facebook message March 15 saying that his father had been excommunicated from the church. Later, though, Nathan Phelps said it was ""unclear"" whether his father had been expelled from Westboro. Video: Phelps' daughter takes part in WBC protest same day he died . A church statement issued on March 16 said that ""membership issues are private"" and that eight unnamed elders lead the congregation. On Thursday, the church added, ""Listen carefully; there are no power struggles in the Westboro Baptist Church, and there is no human intercessor -- we serve no man, and no hierarchy, only the Lord Jesus Christ."" For years, Phelps joked about the possibility that his own funeral would draw protests. During a sermon in 2006, he said a CNN reporter once asked how he would feel if that occurred. ""I'd love it. I'd invite them,"" Phelps told the reporter, according to the Wichita Eagle. ""I said: 'I'll put in my will to pay your way. But not first class.' "" But Shirley Phelps-Roper, Phelps' daughter, said Westboro will not hold a funeral for its patriarch. ""We do not worship the dead,"" Phelps-Roper told CNN.","Church spokesman says Phelps died late Wednesday of natural causes .

"(CNN) -- Just under ten years ago, the Dutch-British physicist Andre Geim stumbled across a substance that would revolutionize the way we understand matter and win him and his colleague Kostya Novoselow the 2010 Nobel Prize for Physics. It was graphene -- a one atom thin substance. The Professor of Physics at Manchester University talks to CNN about discovering the first ever 2-dimensional material. CNN: Graphene has been described as a 'miracle material', but what exactly is it? Andre Geim: It's the thinnest material you can get -- it's only one atom thick. A tiny amount can cover a huge area, so one gram could cover a whole football pitch. It's the strongest material we are aware of because you can't slice it any further. Of course, we know that atoms can be divided into elementary particles, but you can't get any material that is thinner than one atom, or it wouldn't count as a material anymore. Graphene is stronger than diamond; it shows extraordinary heat conductance; it conducts electricity a thousand times better than copper -- the list goes on. We're talking about probably 20 superlatives which apply to graphene. Another surprise is that you can just about see it with the naked eye, even though it's only one atom thick! CNN: Your scotch-tape method for discovering the material has gone down in science history. Tell us about that. AG: We were trying to make graphite as thin as possible using lab equipment and for many months we struggled to make it thinner than 10,000 layers. Then we had a kind of Eureka moment. We were using scotch tape on a regular basis in the lab to clean the surface of the graphite. We would look at what was happening on the surface of the graphite and throw the scotch tape in the bin. Then we decided to take the tape out of the bin and look at it under the microscope and we saw really transparent pieces of graphite -- graphene. CNN: Your discovery was certainly a surprise to the science world, but was it a surprise to you? AG: Yes. We live in a 3-dimensional world. My physics intuition, developed over the last thirty years, told me that this material shouldn't exist. And if you had asked 99.9% of scientists around the world they would have said the idea of a 2D material was rubbish and that graphene shouldn't exist. And in most cases they would have been right, but in the case of graphite or graphene, and a dozen other materials like it, our intuition was completely wrong. You can reach this limit of one-atom-thin layers. CNN: But what exactly is graphene useful for? AG: Because of its range of extraordinary properties, people are considering using graphene in a myriad of different applications. For example, because graphene is so strong, people want to use it to reinforce plastics, making them conductive at the same time. Because it's transparent and conducts electricity, people want to use it in applications like mobile phone screens, touch screens, TV screens and so on. People are also considering using it to go beyond silicon technology and make our integrated circuits even denser and speedier. Those are just few examples. CNN: What is the future for graphene? AG: I don't dare try to predict the future, but if the speed of development of the last ten years is of any guidance we can expect to see graphene everywhere soon. Typically it takes 40 years for a new material to move from an academic lab into a consumer product, but within less than ten years graphene has jumped from our lab into an industrial lab and now there are pilot products all over the world. Governments around the world and probably more than 100 companies are spending billions on researching these materials. So, it probably deserves the superlative of the fastest developing material as well. 'Miracle material' chips away at silicon dominance . Frances Perraudin contributed to this report.","Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselow discovered graphene in 2004.

"Researchers in Hawaii have found a mammoth World War II-era Japanese submarine scuttled by the U.S. Navy in 1946 to keep its advanced technology out of the hands of the Soviet Union. The Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory at the University of Hawaii discovered the I-400 in 2,300 feet of water off the southwest coast of Oahu, according the school. ""Finding it where we did was totally unexpected,"" lab operations director and chief submarine pilot Terry Kerby said in a university statement. ""All our research pointed to it being further out to sea."" Piece of Civil War ironclad brought to surface in Savannah . At nearly 400 feet long, the I-400 and its two sister ships were the largest submarines ever built before the nuclear age. Initially conceived as a weapon to target the U.S. mainland and capable of reaching any point on the globe without refueling, the subs were effectively underwater aircraft carriers outfitted with three folding-wing seaplanes capable of carrying an 1,800-pound bomb. The ships were never used to attack the mainland United States and saw only limited service before Japan surrendered in 1945. But their novel design represented a tactical shift in thinking about the use of submarines, which until then had been strictly seen as anti-ship weapons, James Delgado, director of the Maritime Heritage Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in the university statement. Shipwreck hunters stumble across mysterious find . ""Following World War II, submarine experimentation and design changes would continue in this direction, eventually leading to ballistic missile launching capabilities for U.S. submarines at the advent of the nuclear era,"" Delgado told the university. The submarine was found in August, but the laboratory didn't notify the public until after informing the U.S. State Department and the Japanese government, the university said. The I-400 was one of five Japanese submarines captured by the U.S. Navy at the end of World War II and sent to Hawaii for examination, the school said. With tensions rising between the Soviet Union and the United States after the war, the Navy scuttled the ships to avoid their advanced technology falling into the hands of the Soviet navy in what would become one of the first intrigues of the Cold War. The Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory has so far found four of the ships.

"A moment of truth approaches for President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms with Saturday's self-imposed deadline to get the website to work properly for most users. Obama and officials in charge of HealthCare.gov say the ""vast majority"" of people who go to the website to sign up at the end of the month will have a much improved experience than the crashes, error messages and delays users faced when it launched October 1. However, problems continue to plague the system, and technology experts question if the fixes being deployed by a team of government workers, outside contractors and specialists can get it functioning smoothly as soon as Saturday. Luke Chung, president of Virginia-based software developer FMS Inc., called the administration's prediction that HealthCare.gov would work at 80% capacity on or around November 30 an impractical threshold in the software world. ""I don't know how to build something that's only 80% complete,"" Chung told CNN. ""I don't even understand how that works."" The website woes raised questions about the viability and security of the system, and opened the reforms known as Obamacare to fresh attacks by conservative Republicans who seek to dismantle or eliminate them. More bad news emerged Wednesday when the administration announced the website will be unable to enroll small businesses online for another year. White House: Enroll in Obamacare, but not too fast . Small businesses can enroll in other ways in the special small business system known as SHOP, but problems with HealthCare.gov have prevented their online enrollment so far. It was the third delay of the SHOP Marketplace component of the website, this time until November 2014. For now, ""small businesses will be able to enroll directly in a SHOP plan through an insurer, agent or broker and can get certified for a tax credit after they enroll,"" said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that oversees the rollout of the reforms. The Affordable Care Act doesn't require companies with fewer than 50 employees to buy insurance for workers, though workers are required to have coverage. Employers who choose to provide coverage for their workers may qualify for subsidies to reduce their costs. ""We expect that making direct enrollment, tax credit applications and comparison shopping easier will help to ensure that small businesses can take full advantage of the marketplace and tax credits worth up to 50% of employee premiums in 2014,"" Bataille said. However, the head of the International Franchise Association complained the delay in online enrollment made it harder for small business owners to get all the information they need to enroll. ""With this delay, it will also call into question how the small business tax credit is applied,"" said Steve Caldeira, the group's president and CEO. ""Not having the ability to apply electronically will now make this process more confusing, cumbersome and time-consuming for employers."" Republicans pounced on the news, with House Speaker John Boehner urging Obama to delay implementation of the entire Affordable Care Act. ""This law has been an absolute disaster, leaving us to ask, 'What's next?' "" the Ohio Republican said in a statement. ""If the President won't repeal it, he should at least delay the entire law before it wreaks any more havoc on American families and small businesses as well as our economy."" Boehner signs up for Obamacare . Meanwhile, insurance industry insiders told CNN on condition of not being identified that problems continue with the transmission of data submitted by people signing up for coverage through HealthCare.gov. ""There's no part of us that thinks all of this will be fixed in three days from now,"" an industry official said, referring to the November 30 date for the site to run smoothly for most users. Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the insurance trade group America's Health Insurance Plans, said that ""there is still a lot of work to be done to make sure that enrollments can be done and processed accurately."" Insurers: Despite deadline, Obamacare glitches persist . Wednesday's developments came as the Obama administration prepared for a potential surge in online enrollment over the weekend. According to a White House official, the administration suggested this week that allied organizations hold off on launching campaigns to drive traffic to the website in the first week of December. Officials fear another huge surge in volume that the site can't handle, which is what occurred around its launch in October. HealthCare.gov was originally planned to handle 50,000 concurrent users, and will reach that capacity by Saturday, the White House official said. However, big spikes in traffic -- such as the 200,000 who tried to get on at the same time on October 1 -- would cause users to go into a queue to receive e-mails advising them when to return, the official noted. Publicly, Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have been urging Americans to give HealthCare.gov another try, though they make clear it remains a work in progress. The November 30 target for website improvements ""does not represent a relaunch of HealthCare.gov; it is not a magical date,"" Bataille told reporters. ""There will be times after November 30 when HealthCare.gov does not function properly."" Website woes aside, a new CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday showed a majority of Americans believe the current Obamacare problems can be solved, and the figures for overall support and opposition remain little changed from a month ago. In a conference call Tuesday with state and local officials, Sebelius listed steps taken so far to improve the website's performance. ""We've added hardware, we've added software; we're continuing to work on the parts of the website that were too confusing to people,"" she said, urging the officials ""to not hesitate to recommend that people go to HealthCare.gov and get signed up because that experience is currently working much better and it will continue to work much better."" Sebelius: Obamacare website improvements 'on track' A properly functioning website is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the Affordable Care Act that require people to have health coverage. The failure of HealthCare.gov to enable people to enroll when the sign-up period began last month undermined the launch of new health insurance exchanges intended to provide affordable coverage for millions who previously were uninsured or under-insured. In theory, the exchanges create large pools of customers that include generally healthier and less-costly younger people as well as older folks who tend to require more expensive health care. Such large markets would hold down prices by allowing insurance companies to offset the higher costs of aging consumers with the money from lower-cost policy holders, the thinking goes. For the program to work, it needs to sign up younger people less inclined to pay for health coverage they don't believe they need. The GOP opposition targets the entire health care law, not just the website woes, as the ultimate example of big government run amok. Enrollment figures for the first month after the opening of the new insurance exchanges were much lower than initially expected. Now some states have reported stronger numbers. According to a CNN count based on available figures, a little more than 200,000 people have signed up for new private health insurance under Obamacare -- either through the national system or networks set up in 14 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, more than 370,000 have signed up for Medicaid under state programs expanded through the health care reforms, the CNN count shows. The enrollment period runs until March 31, and officials have said the target for the first year was 7 million people. To ensure they have coverage starting on January 1, consumers must sign up by December 23, the administration recently announced. Chung, the software expert, cited December 23 as the most significant deadline, noting that demand would be huge because people by nature wait until the last minute. Success for the website would be determined by both the number of users as well as how long they are in the system, Chung said, comparing it to a highway on which 50,000 people traveling 60 mph is smooth traffic while the same number going 10 mph is a jam. Also Wednesday, seven Democratic senators, including some up for re-election next year, asked Obama to appoint a special health care overseer to ensure continuity in efforts to fix the problems. Sebelius is technically the top administration official in the implementation of Obamacare, but former White House aide Jeff Zients was brought in last month to oversee efforts to fix the site. Zients will become a top economic adviser to Obama in January. In a letter, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mark Warner of Virginia, Christopher Coons of Delaware, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Udall of Colorado and Tim Kaine of Virginia called for Obama to name a  successor to Zients. Separately,  an HHS official confirmed the government will go with a new Web-hosting contractor, Hewlett-Packard, for HealthCare.gov early next year. The current contract with Terremark ends in March. The official said the decision to go with a different vendor was made months before any problems with HealthCare.gov were identified and was unrelated to an outage that struck the site in late October, which the administration blamed on the Verizon subsidiary.

"(CNN) -- Dear Mr. Lucas, . Happy Star Wars Day to you! I hope you are enjoying May the 4th, the day fans of your movies have turned into an unofficial holiday celebrating the world you have created, and which we love. As you -- or whomever you pay to do it -- look through the social networks and see your fans declaring ""May the 4th be with you,"" please stop and think about how you have turned it into a bad marketing ploy for the Blu-Ray release of the ""Star Wars"" movies. I am sure by now that all is revealed on the official Star Wars May the 4th Day page, and now enough people have spread the word of how you are revealing images and information from the upcoming release of the movies on Blu-Ray. In order to see more and more extras, they had to press a ""share this site"" button, spamming their friends in order to get a glimpse of the forthcoming DVDs. I am sure the extras revealed through the site will give fans plenty to talk and debate about. I, for one, am excited to see the special features and hear the commentary tracks that have been revealed and every other part of the Blu-Ray DVDs when we get them in September. But that's months from now. Today is a special day, just for fans. Why, then, would you take advantage of your fans to promote something that we won't even get to buy until September 16? Why do this now? Is there a chance that you did not know why May the 4th was special to ""Star Wars"" fans? That it is a day we all get to say, ""May the 4th be with you,"" a play on your great line, ""May the Force be with you,"" with unabashed geekiness? This is a day when fans get to show the world how much we love the ""Star Wars"" world you created; a day to show just how large the fan base is; that ""Star Wars"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. Didn't you know? Did you think we wouldn't buy the DVDs in record numbers? Are the preorders on Amazon not hitting big enough totals for your liking? Of course most, if not all, of your fans will buy the ""new"" versions of these movies. And just like I said in my last letter to you -- you did get my last letter, right? I only ask because I never heard back from you, so I was just wondering -- I am sad to say, we'll buy them all over again when you release ""newer"" versions of them in the future. But I ask again, sir, why today? It's a little funny that you are using the fans and their social networks to reveal tantalizing tidbits of the upcoming Blu-Ray DVDs when you recently announced the official Starwars.com forums will be closing on June 3. It is also interesting that by yesterday the forums were already locked down to read-only. Does that mean that it's OK to use your fans' voices to promote a product but it's not OK for them to voice dissent on your own website? Today was supposed to be a day of celebration. But now all I want to do is vent. How can my fellow fans of the Star Wars universe let their voices be heard? Should we just use the Facebook page? If we feel taken advantage of by the Star Wars May the 4th page, should we e-mail Lucasfilm? Of course, I thank you for the incredible, imaginative world you created with ""Star Wars,"" and for the happiness it's brought me and all your fans. And I'm sure I will get hours of enjoyment from the new DVDs when I get them in September. But I did not and do not want them marketed to me on this day. May the 4th is a day that we created, and you, sir, are trying to steal from us. May the Force be with you!

"When Janet Servoss shops for clothes in Orange County, California, she sees plenty of selection in sizes 0, 2 and 4, but fewer in sizes 12 and 14. ""You're bombarded by it daily,"" she said of the message that thin is better. ""It's everywhere."" But according to a report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, being thin might not be in your best interest in the long run. The report is drawing strong reaction in the medical community, among proponents who hail its findings and among critics, one of whom dismisses it as ""rubbish."" The comprehensive study confirmed that obese people tend to die earlier than people of normal weight. But it also found that overweight people -- those with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 30 -- had a lower risk of dying than people of normal weight. ""If I were to look at this study and if it is shown to be true, I would think maybe I should be worrying less that I'm wearing a size 12 and focus on how I feel,"" said Servoss, a 44-year-old nurse whose BMI fluctuates from 24 to 26. Researchers analyzed nearly 100 studies that included more than 2.8 million people. While obese people had a higher risk of death -- particularly those whose BMI was 35 or more -- overweight people had a 6% lower risk of death than those of normal weight. ""Because this bias against weight has been so prevalent, it's really been unquestioned, and I think this concept that thin is healthy and fat is not healthy is clearly not true,"" said Michelle May, a physician and author of ""Eat What You Love, Love What You Eat."" Big deal: You can be fat and fit . Some thin people exercise excessively and don't eat a balanced diet, and there are people in the overweight and obese categories who have good diets and are active, she said. May said people need to focus on choices about eating and physical activity rather than be concerned about the numbers on a scale. ""I find it interesting that the reason they did this is because this is something that has shown up over and over again. It is challenging to shift a paradigm that has become so deeply entrenched, that being overweight by BMI category automatically puts you at high risk,"" she said. Americans overemphasize the importance of being thin, said professor Glenn Gaesser, author of ""Big Fat Lies"" and director of the Healthy Lifestyles Research Center at Arizona State University. ""We have had for decades now an obsession with thinness and an obsession with weight and how to lose it,"" he said. ""I think the forces in our culture -- in fashion, in fitness, in health and wellness -- all have been predicated on, 'A thin body is a good body and a fat body is a bad body,' and that's wrong. I have always believed that a good, healthy body can come in many shapes and sizes."" Fat, fit people tend to be better off healthwise than thin people who are unfit, Gaesser said, suggesting that being fit is far more important than being thin. ""I think in general, America is still not ready to accept this notion that fitness comes in many shapes and sizes,"" he said. ""It's a good message, but I still think people would rather be thin."" Exercise lengthens your life -- even if you're overweight . The study authors say it's possible that overweight people live longer because they get better medical care and are tested for diabetes, heart problems and other diseases stemming from their weight. Heavier people might also be able to better survive infections or surgery. While many say the findings make sense, some experts take issue with the way the research was conducted and express concern it will send wrong message. ""Of course, a lot of people would like to hear that it's no problem that they are overweight or obese,"" said Walter Willett, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chair of the Harvard School of Public Health's Department of Nutrition. ""It causes a lot of confusion that's completely unnecessary."" He called the study ""a pile of rubbish."" Scientists often disagree, said Barry Graubard, senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute and one of the authors of the study. ""We published our findings in the peer-reviewed scientific literature to invite discussion,"" he said in an e-mail. ""It is by engaging with our colleagues in this manner that science advances."" BMI is one of three numbers people should watch, according to Willett. ""It's also useful to look at weight change since age 20,"" he said. ""That's going to primarily be fat. The third is your waistline. The vast majority of people will be best off if they do not increase their weight or waistline after age 20."" Not smoking, eating a high-quality and healthful diet, not being overweight and being physically active all contribute to a person's health, he said. Memphis, most obese U.S. city, moving from fat to fit . While the majority of experts and scientists believe that excess weight is unhealthy, Dr. Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, professor of medicine and public health at the University of California, Irvine, takes a different stance. A black-and-white approach to obesity is inappropriate, he said. ""Most experts have problems with this sort of data,"" he said. ""It's difficult to see that some of these principles are being questioned."" Kalantar-Zadeh compares the lack of consensus about weight and fat to the evolution of thought about alcohol consumption. Alcohol was thought to be detrimental to a person's health, but studies started to show that alcohol consumption in moderation could have some health benefits, he said. ""The fat-is-bad principle is a very recent approach,"" he said. ""Body-stored fat has helped us for hundreds of thousands of years to survive hardships. That should tell us evolutionarily there was something good in that."" A higher body mass index can be protective in certain situations, he said. ""Once you are in your 70s, 80s or 90s, or if you have chronic disease like heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic lung and kidney disease, a larger body size gives you longevity,"" he said. Not all fat is bad, but belly fat is more harmful than fat in the arms, legs or buttocks, he said. Global report: Obesity bigger health crisis than hunger . Fitness expert John Siracuse said people shouldn't get caught up with numbers. ""I always got people focused on their bodies rather than on a number and make them more aware of their muscle tissue, their shape,"" he said. ""Are they getting stronger? Faster? Can they pedal longer? If you listen to your body more, you will know the symptoms before your body starts to break down. We tend to forget about our bodies and that's when we start getting fat."" Servoss said she can see where a little bit of extra fat could be good for people facing a serious illness, but said the more weight you have, the harder it is on your joints. Excess weight also comes with numerous health challenges, including circulatory problems, high blood pressure and diabetes, she said. ""I think the numbers have their place,"" she said. ""They do give us some reference but it does ultimately come down to how you are feeling, your exercise tolerance, are you able to do the things you love to do without any difficulty? ""That's the kind of thing I should be focusing more on, rather than that my jeans come from the back of the rack rather than the front,"" she said.","A highly debated study says overweight people may live longer .

"Gunfire crackles and flames scar battlefields in eastern Ukraine -- signs, officials warn, of a crumbling ceasefire in the volatile region. And there's new fear that the long simmering battle may be about to explode to a deadly new level. Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, said he's concerned about the escalating violence and accused Moscow of violating the norms of Western civilization. ""The ceasefire is in name only at this point,"" he told reporters Tuesday. ""The violence continues to increase day by day."" Ukraine's government and separatist leaders signed a ceasefire deal in September, raising hope that the monthslong conflict in eastern Ukraine was nearing an end. But now, fighting between pro-Russian rebel forces and the Ukrainian military has returned to levels that preceded the ceasefire, a British security source who has detailed knowledge of the matter told CNN. Russia has amassed some 8,000 troops along the Ukraine border, Pentagon officials and the British security source said. Russia has also stepped up shipments of heavy weapons to separatists in recent days, Pentagon officials say. And Moscow has again sent in a convoy that it claims is humanitarian, but U.S. and Ukrainian officials say went through no independent inspection. The situation has come up in meetings between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meetings in Beijing. But even the Obama administration admits that -- so far -- U.S.-led sanctions are not deterring Russia. ""The sanctions have yet to sufficiently affect Russia's calculus as it relates to Ukraine,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters. ""That's why we continue to impose them. That's why we continue to be very clear about where we need to see better Russian action."" The sanctions clearly are having an impact on Russia's economy, he said. Still, he said, ""on Ukraine, we continue to be deeply troubled by Russia's actions."" The British source told CNN that so-called forced ""Russification"" is taking place in the Crimean region, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in March. Those who have declined Russian citizenship in Crimea are being classed as ""foreigners,"" the sources said, and have faced difficulty in obtaining health care and banking services. Russia argues that a majority of the region's residents voted to be ruled by Moscow. But Ukrainian leaders and many Western officials have accused Russia of violating Ukraine's sovereignty in what amounts to an illegal land grab. Russian state media, meanwhile, has warned that NATO is strengthening its presence in the Baltic region and said the Russian Defense Ministry plans to discuss security in Crimea at a meeting Wednesday.","""The violence continues to increase day by day,"" NATO commander warns .

"ISIS, as the Islamic State jihadists in Iraq and Syria are known, has become the new face of international terrorism in the eyes of the United States and its Western allies. Now the focus in America and abroad has become what will President Barack Obama and other leaders do about it? Here are key questions on the matter: . 1) Who killed James Foley? Britain's ambassador to the United States, Peter Westmacott, told CNN on Sunday that British officials were close to identifying the ISIS militant who beheaded Foley, an American journalist captured in Syria in 2012. He couldn't elaborate on the identity of the killer, who is seen decapitating Foley in a video posted last week on YouTube. ""We're putting a great deal into the search,"" he said, referring to the use of sophisticated technology to analyze the man's voice. In the video, Foley, 40, is seen kneeling next to a man dressed in black, who speaks with what experts say is a distinctly English accent. Linguists said that based on his voice, the man sounds to be younger than 30. He also appears to have been educated in England from a young age and to be from southern England or London. Britain close to identifying James Foley's killer, ambassador says . 2) Will the United States expand air strikes to ISIS targets in Syria? Pressure is increasing on Obama to go after ISIS in both Iraq and Syria, ignoring an essentially non-existent border between them. Last week, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said that taking on ISIS in Syria was the only way to defeat the Sunni jihadists. For Obama, the step would reverse his refusal for three years to get involved militarily in Syria despite pressure from his own advisers, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Obama ""has not made any decision to order military action in Syria,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday, but the speculation and insistence continued. ""The White House is trying to minimize the threat we face in order to justify not changing a failed strategy,"" conservative GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Monday. CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said it will be difficult to defeat ISIS without ground forces, something Obama clearly opposes. Intervening in Syria also could result in some strange geopolitical bedfellows, he noted. ""Two of the most effective fighting forces in Syria are al Qaeda or al Qaeda splinter groups, or groups like Hezbollah, backed by Iran,"" Bergen said. ""So if you intervene, you may be helping Iran and Hezbollah and (Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's) regime."" Obama already sent military advisers to Iraq and launched air strikes to protect them and minority groups from ISIS fighters rampaging through the country's north. Is Obama heading toward airstrikes in Syria? A White House spokesman said last week that Obama would consult with Congress before taking such a step in Syria. The President also would seek to forge a coalition including regional allies as well as U.N. and European Union support, officials have made clear. Republicans urge airstrikes in Syria to defeat ISIS . 3) Will the Syrian regime that Obama opposes help fight ISIS? Obama wants al-Assad out of power, but now the Syrian leader engaged in a civil war against a U.S.-backed opposition is offering to help him take on ISIS. Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said Monday his government would accept support from the United States and others working under the U.N. umbrella to fight ""terrorists"" -- a code word for the group that calls itself the Islamic State and seeks to establish a caliphate across a Sunni-dominated swath of the the Middle East. Moallem, however, warned against any unilateral action or strikes in Syrian territory without its permission, saying ""any effort to fight terrorism should be done in coordination"" with the ""Syrian government."" Last week, Atlantic Council senior fellow and Syria expert Frederic Hof said a U.S. rescue mission for Foley earlier this year that went into Syria but failed to find him established the precedent for military action across the Iraq border, superseding any legal considerations such as being asked by the host government to enter. ""The sort of legal barrier that prohibited doing something inside Syria now seems to have evaporated,"" Hof said. The Syrian offer to help fight ISIS comes after al-Assad's government enabled the group to expand amid the Syrian civil war. ISIS fighters have attacked the Syrian opposition fighting government forces, but also have seized some government territory. Al-Assad's military recently launched its own air strikes on ISIS positions, amounting to what Hof described as a dispute between crime gangs over money -- in this case, from oil fields occupied by ISIS. Syria ready to cooperate with UN to fight terror . 4) Will ISIS attack the West? To some in the United States, especially critics of Obama, an ISIS attack on U.S. interests and even the homeland is a question of when, not if. ""ISIS is a very powerful local organization, and probably a reasonably powerful regional terrorist organization,"" former CIA chief Michael Hayden told CNN on Sunday. ""But it's one that has global ambitions -- and it has the tools."" There's no clear consensus inside the intelligence community as to whether ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, is currently capable of striking the West. ""It's expressed the intent,"" Hayden said. ""There's no more powerful way to express their street credentials among the jihadist community than a successful attack against the West."" Graham, a consistent advocate for increased U.S. military might, told CNN on Sunday that ""it's about time now to assume the worst about these guys, rather than to be underestimating them."" ISIS threat to the West . 5) Can the ISIS money flow be stopped? Bank robbery, kidnapping, smuggling, selling oil on the black market -- ISIS gets money to fund and expand its organization in all kinds of ways. Officials say the group can get about $3 million a day by selling discounted oil from fields it has seized in Iraq. It also has grabbed millions robbing banks including an Iraqi central bank in Mosul. Western allies can reduce the group's income by refusing to pay ransom for abducted citizens and pressuring regional governments to crack down on wealthy citizens sending money to it. The United States is working with governments in the region, including Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, to stop such private donations, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said last week.

"Washington (CNN) -- Think big -- really big -- and you may understand the stakes in an upcoming Supreme Court case that could have a profound impact on nearly every American business with employees. At issue is whether the justices should allow certification of the largest class-action employment lawsuit in U.S. history, a long-standing dispute against mega-corporation Wal-Mart Stores Inc. over alleged gender bias in pay and promotions. Arguments in the case are Tuesday morning and ruling can be expected by late June. The company is the world's largest retailer and the nation's largest private employer. If the class-action goes through, hundreds of thousands of women -- perhaps as many as 1.6 million plaintiffs -- could join in the largest discrimination claim of its kind. Tens of billions of dollars or more in damages are potentially at stake. The high court case is among the biggest of the current term, and could establish binding standards over high-stakes liability involving companies large and small. 'I'm a fighter' A mammoth appeal started small -- six women from California, unknown to each other at first, but sharing a common story. ""I'm a fighter if nothing else, and so are all the other women that are involved,"" said Christine Kwapnoski, one of the original plaintiffs. Speaking with CNN, she recounted why she brought suit against Wal-Mart in 2001. ""I was saying I want to do something more, but for whatever reason I kept getting overlooked for team leader positions,"" she said. ""They kept hiring men off the street. Literally, I don't even know where they came from, whether they came from college, men who never even had a day's worth of Sam's Club experience were coming in and I was the one training them."" Kwapnoski, 46, began working at Sam's Club retail warehouse -- part of the Wal-Mart brand -- in 1986, eventually relocating to a store in Concord, California. By 2000 she was the longest-tenured hourly employee at the store, but claims she was being paid ""virtually the same"" as male associates with half her experience. She was eventually promoted in 2001, two weeks after the lawsuit was filed, and remains at the company. Kwapnoski soon realized her experiences were similar to other female workers -- first in the San Francisco Bay area, then across the country. ""They know we're right and they just don't want to admit it,"" she told CNN Correspondent Kate Bolduan. ""They never want to admit anything when they're wrong, they just believe that they're semi-untouchable because of their size."" Kwapnoski claims she was told by a male general manager ""to doll up,"" wear more makeup and dress a little better as a new supervisor on the loading dock, comments she says were inappropriate. And she says managers frequently yelled at her and other female workers, but not male counterparts. The plaintiff's lawyer Joseph Sellers says there is a ""corporate culture"" at Wal-Mart, where female associates are treated as second-class employees, and that the company's ""strong, centralized structure fosters or facilitates gender stereotyping and discrimination,"" which trickles down to individual stores. ""The store managers don't make up their own pay and promotion policy -- they follow a common set of policies that are established by headquarters in Arkansas,"" he said. ""There is extensive oversight of the decisions they make."" Spokeswoman says people are held accountable . Wal-Mart operates 4,300 facilities in the U.S., with more than $400 billion in global sales in 2009. It employs 1.4 million people in the U.S. alone. Officials boast their anti-discrimination policy has been in place as long as the company has been around, and a recent public relations campaign has been launched to promote its diversity and inclusion. Gisel Ruiz is an example of what Wal-Mart says is a person who started small but has risen in the company because of her talents and hard work. After beginning as a store management trainee nearly two decades ago in California, she is now executive vice president for people at Wal-Mart, responsible for human resources. Ruiz is also a spokesperson in corporate efforts to fight these claims of discrimination. ""From my personal experience, it's not part of the company's culture or part of the policies. My career growth has been very positive with Wal-Mart. I am in a job that I never dreamed that I would be -- it's based on my ability, my performance, my leadership abilities, but I am just one of many women,"" she told CNN. ""I've never been exposed to the examples that have been shared by the plaintiffs. I simply haven't seen it and I will tell you that we don't have a tolerance for that kind of misconduct."" Ruiz says every employee from part-time entry level hourly workers to salaried managers must follow the rules. ""The policies against discrimination are in place for very good reasons; not only is the law, but is the right thing to do,"" she said. ""There's oversight at a corporate level to ensure that the policies are in place, that they are relevant to today's workforce and today's workforce issues. Ultimately at store level, that's where those policies are enforced, and people are held accountable if they violate those policies."" Wal-Mart says case is too big . The workers bringing suit say women represent more than 70% of Wal-Mart's hourly workforce, but in the past decade made up less than one-third of its store management. A federal appeals court had concluded there was enough merit in the claims to proceed to trial on a class-action track. Since the lawsuit was filed a decade ago, both sides of the dispute have held discovery hearings, where preliminary testimony was taken to establish facts. The high court will not judge the merits of the sweeping claims at this stage, just whether a class-action trial can proceed. The parties have the option of settling the dispute out of court at some point in the future, and the company may feel great financial pressure to do if they lose at the Supreme Court on this gateway issue. The company has protested the size of the class action, which it called ""historic"" in scope, saying it would be onerous, with too many disparate issues, to litigate. ""The plaintiff's lawyers in this case went way too far. It's the way the plaintiffs have framed the case, implicating every store, every person. There's no way, one woman can be representative of a million women in a case like this,"" said Theodore Boutrous, an experienced appellate attorney who will argue the case for Wal-Mart before the justices. ""The danger is that it would expose virtually every company in America to huge, costly, baseless class actions that's bad for jobs, bad for the economy, and at the end of day it doesn't help the people on behalf the case is being brought."" The company has the support of the business community, while a variety of civil and gender rights groups and unions back the plaintiffs. The Obama administration has not weighed in on the case. ""Wal-Mart is arguing in effect there is a large-company exception -- that when the company is sufficiently large and the discrimination is sufficiently widespread -- it's just impractical to have a class action,"" said Sellers, attorney for the plaintiffs. ""But there is no large-company exception to civil rights claims in this country."" Declaring class-action status for the lawsuit raises the financial and judicial stakes considerably, since more individual plaintiffs can now join, creating greater potential liability for the company being sued. In federal courts, such certification must generally follow well-established principles to ensure a lawsuit would not become so large as to be impracticable, and would allow the parties to fairly represent the common interests of the larger class of plaintiffs. Wal-Mart also has been accused in separate lawsuits of discrimination against African-American truck drivers and workers with disabilities. In 2001 the company settled 13 lawsuits by paying out $6 million. Most workplace discrimination lawsuits fail to reach a court for resolution, according to data compiled by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In 2003, when the Wal-Mart litigation was in its preliminary court stages, about 27,000 sex discrimination claims nationwide were resolved administratively by the EEOC, little changed from the prior decade. More than 57 percent -- some 15,000 claims -- were ruled administratively to have ""no reasonable cause"" and those usually were dismissed. Just over 10 percent were judged to have merit, resulting in a total of $94.2 million in settlements, or $34,200 on average per case, according to the data, which include all such claims, not just those involving Wal-Mart. The case is also a clash of dueling cultures -- some have dubbed it the Battle of Bentonville vs. Berkeley, for the corporate headquarters and the home to the liberal legal team outside San Francisco where the lawsuits first percolated. Both sides have lots of data . Three women now sit on the high court and each brings their own personal and judicial approach to gender bias cases. This is particularly true for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a legal pioneer in promoting equality on the job. Whether their views will sway their male colleagues is unknown, but the court in the past three decades has restricted when class actions can proceed, saying ""rigorous analysis"" must first be conducted by the courts. This after women, blacks, Latinos and the disabled launched high-profile class actions beginning in the 1960s. The problem is that both Wal-Mart and the plaintiffs have presented their own massive sets of data -- statistics and depositions -- that could overwhelm any ""rigorous analysis"" of the facts. The dueling numbers -- which experience shows can often be manipulated in creative ways to make the point -- paint completely different pictures of the level of discrimination. Both sides agree the case, however it is resolved in the courts, will irrevocably alter the workplace landscape for generations to come. The case is Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (10-277).","Court to decide only whether case can proceed as class-action suit .
It would be the largest discrimination case of its kind .
Wal-Mart argues size would make case onerous ."
