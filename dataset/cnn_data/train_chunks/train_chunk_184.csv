"(CNN) -- Let's pretend you just won $40 million. Do you sprint up and down the street ""like a crazy woman""? Break into a ""happy dance,"" while holding your oversized lottery check? Celebrate by chowing down at a Chinese buffet with your family? If you're Maria Carreiro, the answer is all of the above -- and then some. The 51-year-old grandmother couldn't contain her excitement, when she talked to, sang to and danced for reporters on Monday after her big, big win. ""Thank you Lord, thank you Lord!"" sang the ebullient, dancing Carreiro. The Portuguese immigrant bought the ticket last Friday at Variety and Video, a store in Toronto, according to the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation. It was a bit of a splurge, because she didn't ""have a lot of spending money,"" but it was one that would change her life forever. After an initial check on Saturday morning, she excitedly told her daughter that she had won $40,000. ""Then ... she checked on the computer,"" Carreiro recalled. ""She said, 'Mommy, you're $40 million richer.' "" What followed was pure joy. ""So I ran down the street like a crazy woman and checked the lottery ticket, and it said $40 million,"" she said of the winning ticket, which works out to about $39.4 million U.S. dollars. ""And then I go, 'Oh my god!' And I ran back up the street, home. And then I go, 'I need a glass of water,' "" added an ever-smiling Carreiro, stirring laughter from the press corps. For years, she worked in factories. Beyond that, many of her days have been spent caring for her children and grandchildren. Now, the time has come to take care of all of them and herself. That includes the honeymoon she never had, in Hawaii, with her husband, who at first didn't believe they'd struck it rich but has since quit his job. Carreiro said she also plans on using the money to buy a house ""for my daughters and me."" (But first, she said, the family enjoyed an all-you-can-eat meal at a Chinese restaurant.) While there's no hiding their joy, her family is still coming to grips with their new, much richer reality -- after years of hard work, sacrifice and doing what they could to get by. ""It still hasn't sunk in,"" said Carreiro's daughter Manuela, her eyes welling with tears. ""My dad works so hard, and we've been struggling so much ... $40 million is so much money.""

"New York (CNN) -- The fate of a New York City police officer accused of engaging in a plot to kidnap women and cannibalize them now lies in the hands of the jury. Jurors began deliberations to determine whether e-mail conversations Gilberto Valle had with alleged co-conspirators about plans to kidnap, torture, rape, cook and eat women were real or fantasy role-play. Valle, who was suspended without pay after his arrest in October, is charged in U.S. District Court with conspiracy to kidnap and accessing a law enforcement database illegally. None of Valle's alleged targets was ever victimized. Valle faces life in prison if convicted of conspiracy. Trial: Graphic photos, how-to-kidnap searches found on computer used by cop . In closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman argued that the evidence shown in court proved that Valle had entered into an agreement with his co-conspirators to kidnap the alleged targets through e-mail conversations. Waxman argued that Valle conducted surveillance and handed out police charity cards in furtherance of his plan to kidnap the targets. Waxman argued that Valle expressed ""real, practical concern"" for getting caught during his conversations and was methodical and strategic in his online research of how to carry out kidnappings. She said Valle's research of mass murderers and kidnappers were proof that he was trying to be careful about his alleged plan. Waxman urged the jury to use ""common sense"" and look at the ""big picture"" during deliberation. Cop's defense: Cannibalism chats were fantasy . Defense attorney Julia Gatto began her closing statements by repeating ""I have a world in my mind,"" Valle's words to another fantasy role-play partner extracted from e-mail conversations revealed in court. ""In that world I'm kidnapping women and selling them to people interested in buying them,"" she read aloud from Valle's e-mail conversation. She said Valle had engaged in ""dark improv theater"" and said he fantasized about real people to heighten the experience. Gatto told the jury that it was a part of ""crude, stupid, infantile, masturbatory storytelling."" Gatto said the government's case was ""riddled with reasonable doubt."" She noted that testimony in court revealed the FBI did not find the chloroform, rope, or a human-size oven that Valle alleged he had. ""This case is about storytelling, and the government has told a story too,"" Gatto said in court. Graphic e-mails read at New York cannibalism plot trial . Assistant U.S Attorney Randall Jackson said in his rebuttal that evidence proved that ""this was not someone just having fun."" He banged his fist on the table, telling the jury that government evidence revealed ""things you would expect to see in a plot to actively victimize someone."" ""His porn consists of dead bodies,"" Jackson said. ""That is not normal."" In his instructions, Judge Paul Gardephe advised jurors not to convict based solely on the defendant's thoughts alone, or the nature of the content on the Dark Fetish Network reviewed in court. The jury will resume its deliberations Friday morning. Prosecutors: NYPD officer was 'deadly serious' about cannibalism scheme .

"(CNN) -- Google's new Nexus S smartphone has launched. Literally. To celebrate the release of the Nexus S, Google employees constructed seven hobbyist-style air balloons, each containing a phone, and sent them into orbit. In a company blog post chronicling the nerdy stunt, Google's Zi Wang wrote that the project was intended to help test some of the hardware sensors in the phone. But that could just be a front to convince their bosses they weren't goofing off. Or it could be related to a project Wang mentioned in an interview with New Scientist last week. Google is in talks with a UK satellite manufacturer about contributing the core technology in the Nexus S to help build small satellites, according to that report. ""The phone is powerful enough,"" Wang told the science publication. Google says it recovered all seven capsules from the test run. At least one of those reached higher than 100,000 feet (more than 20 miles). The phones stopped functioning at 60,000 feet -- about twice as high as most planes fly. Not bad for being in space without a helmet. Google says the phones started working again on descent. The company posted several videos about the project on YouTube.","Google sent seven air balloons with Android phones into orbit .

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey man was arrested this month after authorities determined he had taken explosives onto a commuter train several days earlier, court documents show. Authorities say their investigation determined that Mykyta Panasenko, 27, carried two improvised explosive devices aboard a Suffern, New York-bound New Jersey transit train on April 7. A criminal complaint filed on April 15, when Panasenko was arrested, indicates that the devices were constructed ""from a cylinder containing Pyrodex,"" a form of black powder. Common uses for black powder include as gunpowder in muzzle-loading guns, as a blasting powder and as a propellant in rockets for fireworks. Panasenko did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. But he told the New York Daily News, ""They were fireworks."" Panasenko, who was released on his own recognizance following his arrest, said when FBI agents questioned him, he told them he had no bad intentions and did not know the devices were illegal. ""Obviously, it was a bad idea"" to take them on the train, he told the newspaper. Contrary to some media reports, Panasenko was not arrested on the train, and no completed explosive devices were recovered on the train or in Panasenko's home, according to a news release from the Jersey City Police Department. Officers did, however, recover components of an explosive device at his home, according to Gene Rubino, spokesman for the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office. He did not comment on what officials believe became of the devices Panasenko is alleged to have taken on the train. Panasenko ""did recklessly create a risk of widespread injury or damage to a building"" by constructing the devices at his home, Rubino said. The FBI and other federal and state agencies have been notified about the case, according to Rubino. Panasenko is being charged with possession of a prohibited device and creating a risk of widespread damage.

"(CNN) -- A well-placed pool of water and an air pocket appear to have combined to help a young woman survive for 16 days under the rubble of a collapsed Bangladeshi building. The woman, who was pulled out Friday from the remains of the garment factory, was found in that pool of water, rescue official Lt. Col. Moazzem Hossain told CNN. It would have been crucial to her survival, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. The woman, known only as Reshma, 19, was able to use an iron rod to get workers' attention and cry out to them, ""I'm alive. Please rescue me,"" according to Capt. Ibrahim Islam, a Bangladeshi military official outside the recovery operation. The rescue was a bright spot against the grim recovery. The death toll from the April 24 collapse is more than 1,000. The woman reportedly was in a partially collapsed room and had access to an air pocket, which Gupta said is ""obviously, the most crucial thing."" In addition, ""having some access to water must have happened here,"" he noted. The source of the pool of water was unclear. Water may have trickled to the building's basement, where Reshma was found, from recent rains and from water sprayed by rescuers. Firefighters had hosed down the area to extinguish a fire that erupted during a failed rescue attempt. Gupta said the woman likely had some sort of access to food, although people have been known to survive a couple of weeks without it. He said it was ""somewhat surprising"" that Reshma would have been able to call out to rescuers, as ""even that requires a fair amount of energy."" Asked how long someone can survive without food or water, Gupta said, ""We keep redefining that a bit."" He recalled the case of Evan Muncie, a then-28-year-old man who was pulled alive from a building in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, about four weeks after a January 2010 earthquake that leveled much of the city. It is believed Muncie had some access to food and water, although details remain murky, he said. Also, Reshma's youth may have worked in her favor, he said. ""The body can be very good at preserving itself."" A body can enter a state known as starvation ketosis, Gupta said, in which it utilizes muscles and other sorts of protein to feed itself. State-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) reported Reshma told her rescuers that she survived on dry food and water that was tossed into the rubble in the first days after the collapse. ""I ate biscuits and water,"" she told rescuers, according to the news agency, ""but the stock dwindled two days ago."" Reshma told doctors at a military hospital, where she was taken, that she was wracked by third for the past two days. She spent the entire time in the dark between floors that had collapsed, according to the BSS report. While Reshma's outlook is favorable, food will have to be reintroduced slowly, Gupta said, noting that Muncie had lost 30 pounds while buried under the Haitian rubble. ""My guess is, she's extremely weak,"" he said. CNN's Caitlin Hagan contributed to this report.","Sanjay Gupta: The pool of water and the air pocket the woman was in were crucial .

"(CNN) -- Two California teens who stranded themselves atop a windy, 8,600-foot-high cliff ended up being rescued in what resembled a movie scene, according to authorities. The boys, 16 and 17, were hoisted off the cliff in the Sierra Buttes in Northern California on Saturday, according to the California Highway Patrol. The CHP sent a helicopter and a small plane to retrieve the teens, who had stranded themselves on a narrow shelf on the cliff while hiking. It took several attempts to hoist the boys as winds blew in excess of 20 mph, according to a CHP news release. Rescuers gave them instructions via loud speaker and used a camera system to zoom in to watch the teens safely harness themselves. One teen was hoisted and flown to a designated landing zone on State Highway 49 before the rescue was repeated with the other boy.","The boys, 16 and 17, were hoisted off the cliff in the Sierra Buttes in California .

"(CNN) -- A man arrested at Cannes Film Festival after firing a gun loaded with blanks during a live TV interview is due to appear in court Sunday, Cannes police said. Canal+ was interviewing Christoph Waltz, who won the Academy Award for best supporting actor in ""Django Unchained,"" and actor Daniel Auteuil when a man fired two shots from a starter pistol on Friday, according to authorities and the French television station. The man allegedly had a dummy grenade in one hand, and footage and images of the incident showed Waltz and Auteuil being taken offstage and attendees scrambling for cover. The 43-year-old suspect, who fired twice into the air, told police he believed in God and wanted to change the world, a Cannes police spokesman said Saturday. He has been examined by a psychiatrist who concluded that he ""is not mentally ill,"" the spokesman said. Many police officers were present at the time of the shooting and the suspect was caught immediately, he said. The court is expected to consider the case against the man, who remains in custody but whose name has not been made public, on Sunday, he said. Celebrity sightings at Cannes . 'Fake grenade' The incident, which occurred on the Canal+ set along the popular Promenade de la Croisette -- the main boulevard in Cannes -- briefly interrupted the show. But Canal+ anchor Michel Denisot came back on the air a short time later and told viewers: ""The shots fired were blanks and the grenade was fake. That's what we know."" No injuries were reported. Pictures of the arrest obtained by The Hollywood Reporter showed police wrestling the man to the ground. The man said to a woman next to him, 'If I were you, I wouldn't stick around here',"" Denisot later told France 24. It was far from the typical scripted fare of the Cannes Film Festival, where chaos plays out on screen and not among the audience. The annual festival brings together the rich and famous from around the world for movie screenings and glittering parties. Stolen jewels . Earlier the same day, police in Nice said that more than $1 million in jewels belonging to the Swiss firm Chopard had been stolen from a hotel room in Cannes. Chopard later said in a statement that the value of the stolen pieces was ""far lower than those in the figures circulating in the media."" The theft of the jewels occurred Thursday night, on the second day of the festival, which opened Wednesday and runs through May 26. Commandant Bernard Mascarelli, of the Nice police, said the jewelry was stolen from a room in the Suite Novotel hotel on Boulevard Carnot in Cannes. A Chopard employee who was staying in the room left it for several hours to go to dinner, he said. She returned to discover the whole safe containing the jewels had been unscrewed and taken away. No detailed description has yet been given of the stolen jewels, but a Chopard spokeswoman said they were not part of the firm's ""Red Carpet Collection 2013"" and were not due to be worn by any actresses in Cannes. Chopard, which is an official sponsor of the festival, has provided the Palme d'Or trophy awarded to the director of the best feature film for the past 15 years. The trophy features a 24-carat gold palm attached to a piece of cut crystal. CNN's Chelsea J.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- A man from India died in Pakistan early last week from a beating he took in jail there days before. The day after his passing, a Pakistani inmate received a beating in an Indian prison. He died Thursday, a government official in India said. Some are calling it a revenge attack, something that CNN cannot confirm. Sarabjit Singh was incarcerated in Lahore, after a Pakistani court convicted him of spying for India in connection with terror attacks in Pakistan in 1991. Singh's family has maintained he was innocent. He was sentenced to death. Late last month Singh was hurt in ""a scuffle with fellow inmates,"" according to Pakistan's foreign affairs ministry. The apparent dust up was intense enough to put him into a coma. When he died in a hospital, India's government expressed ""great anguish"" over the violence. ""This was, put simply, the killing of our citizen while in the custody of Pakistan jail authorities,"" the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. ""The criminals responsible for the barbaric and murderous attack on him must be brought to justice,"" demanded Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in a statement. India's media erupted with indignation. ""India outraged over Sarabjit's murder"" read a headline in The Pioneer. ""Sarabjit Singh butchered by our enemies,"" read another in The Times of India. There were claims that the death row inmate's killing had been planned and reports that his organs went missing after his death. Pakistan's ministry of foreign affairs confirmed there was an autopsy. It is not unusual for a pathologist to remove organs in the process. The postmortem revealed that Singh had died of cardiac arrest on May 2, caused by the trauma he had suffered, Pakistan's foreign affairs ministry said. Counter attack? On May 3, Pakistani citizen Sanaullah Ranjay was attacked in an Indian jail in Jammu and transferred in critical condition to a hospital in Chandigarh. After days in a coma, he passed away Thursday. ""He had multiple organ failure due to severe head injury,"" the hospital said in a statement. Pakistan's foreign affairs ministry reacted to Ranjay's death with indignation. ""The brutal manner in which Sanaullah was attacked in the jail is most unfortunate and a matter of deep concern for the Government of Pakistan,"" the ministry said in a statement. Like their counterparts in India, they, too, demand an investigation into the prison killing and that the ""perpetrators of this heinous crime be brought to justice."" There has been little media resonance about the Pakistani inmate's death in India. Singh's remains have already been returned to India, where he was cremated, media there have reported. According to Islamic custom, the body of a deceased person should be buried within 24 hours of death. Indian and Pakistani diplomats have said they are in communication about transferring Ranjay's remains back to his native town of Sialkot in Pakistan. History of strife . Although ties between New Delhi and Islamabad have improved since tensions flared in the aftermath of the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, the two deaths put a fresh strain on their delicate relations. India and Pakistan have fought several wars since their independence from British colonial rule more than 65 years ago. Though some may assume so, it is not yet clear if Ranjay's killing was revenge for Singh's. Many men have died of violence in jails.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- At least five people have been killed and five more injured after clashes between Christians and Muslims in Egypt's Qalyubia province, a spokesman for Egypt's health ministry said. The violence in the city of Khosous, north of Cairo, broke out after Coptic Christians drew crosses on the walls of a Muslim school, angering members of the Muslim community, said spokesman Ahmed Osman. Some of those caught in the clashes pulled out weapons and live ammunition. The alleged perpetrators and other Christians took shelter inside a Coptic church, Osman said. Angry members of the Muslim community tried to storm the building, but security forces arrived in time to prevent them. Tensions between Egypt's Christians and the Muslim majority are heightened. The Christian minority has been the target of a number of high-profile attacks in the past several years. The bombing of a major church in Alexandria in January 2011 left at least 21 people dead, and at least 25 Coptic Christians and their supporters were killed in clashes with the army in October. That incident was the bloodiest in Egypt since its revolution in February. According to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, Egypt's population as of 2010 included an estimated 77 million Muslims and 4 million Coptic Christians.","Official: At least five people die as clashes break out in Qalyubia province, north of Cairo .

"(CNN) -- FIFA have permitted England's soccer players to wear a poppy symbol to honor the country's war dead during Saturday's international friendly with Spain after interventions from the British Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince William. The pair wrote to football's world governing body asking that England be allowed to wear an embroidered poppy on their shirts to remember those in the armed forces who have died in the line of duty. Remembrance Day, on November 11, marks the anniversary of the end of the First World War and the poppy has become the traditional symbol of the occasion. English Premier League clubs wore a poppy on their shirts during last weekend's round of matches. FIFA had initially forbidden the England national team from wearing the symbol on their shirts as it bans political, religious or commercial messages on team strips. But after Clarence House released a statement in which they said Prince William was ""dismayed"" by the decision, and David Cameron told Britain's parliament the ban was ""outrageous"" FIFA relented. They have agreed the poppy symbol can now be included on black armbands England's players will be wearing during the clash with the World and European champions at Wembley. A statement on the English Football Association's (FA) official website read: ""While continuing to adhere to the Laws of the Game, wearing the poppy on the armband does ensure the poppy will be visible throughout the game. The FA welcomes FIFA's decision and thanks them for agreeing to this."" FIFA had initially stood firm on their ban, stating it was applied globally to prevent shirts being used to commemorate national events or to convey political messages. They said agreeing to England's request would ""open the door to similar initiatives"" across the world and ""jeopardize the neutrality of football."" Earlier on Wednesday, Cameron said in a statement: ""The idea that wearing a poppy to remember those who have given their lives for our freedom is a political act is absurd. Wearing a poppy is an act of huge respect and national pride."" He then told parliament: ""It seems outrageous. I hope Fifa will reconsider."" Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, wrote to FIFA in his role as president of the FA and asked for ""an exception in this special circumstance."" A spokesman for the Duke said: ""The Duke's strong view is that the poppy is a universal symbol of remembrance, which has no political, religious or commercial connotations."" After the compromise was struck the Duke was said to be ""happy"" with the resolution.""","FIFA allows England to wear poppy symbol during international with Spain .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Four Italian journalists kidnapped by unknown assailants in Libya have been freed, Italy's Foreign Ministry spokesman Maurizio Massari told CNN on Thursday. They were ""saved by two Libyans, two boys to whom we owe everything,"" one of the journalists said Thursday. ""I'm alive, well and free. Until an hour ago, I thought I was dead,"" the reporter, Sono Domenico Quirico, said, according to his newspaper La Stampa. Another of the journalists, Elisabetta Rosaspina, told CNN they were kidnapped in Tripoli between Martyrs Square and Moammar Gadhafi's compound. Earlier reports said they had been abducted 80 kilometers (about 50 miles) from Tripoli. Claudio Monici, a correspondent for the newspaper Avvenire, said they were seized by the Libyan army and ""other people with guns."" ""We understood that they were very angry. Their eyes had blood,"" he said, saying some of their captors said: ""You are Italian. You are from NATO. You are bombing us."" Monici saw their captors kill their Libyan driver, he said. ""He understood that it was his last moment. We saw them kick him and kill him... When they shot at him I saw that he was praying... I saw that his lips were moving,"" he told Sky News. Massari said while it was unclear who captured the journalists, the ministry assumed it was pro-Gadhafi forces. All of the journalists, from prominent Italian daily newspapers, were well, Massari said Wednesday. He did not elaborate. Paolo Alfieri, foreign editor of the newspaper Avvenire, identified the four as Rosaspina and Giuseppe Sarcina from the newspaper Corriere della Sera, Quirico from La Stampa, and Monici from Avvenire. Alfieri told CNN that those holding the journalists had allowed Monici to make a call to his newsroom. Alfieri said Monici's voice was ""calm"" during the call, and Monici reported that at the time he and the others were ""well."" The call lasted about five to six minutes, Alfieri said, and Monici asked him to alert the Italian Foreign Ministry and the other newspapers. Monici did not say anything about what the kidnappers were demanding.

"(CNN) -- China's energy imports are so fundamental to its survival and development that China's new leadership has taken extraordinary steps to secure future supplies. In a flurry of official visits over the past two months involving President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, China has sought to bolster its energy relations with big strategic neighbors Russia and India, key energy exporters Indonesia, Brunei and South Africa, emerging resources suppliers such as Tanzania and the Republic of Congo in Africa, and renewable energy pioneer Germany. In addition, China hosted a visit by Australian leader Julia Gillard, whose discussions with Xi and Li touched on clean energy expertise and the burgeoning resources trade between the two countries. China's push for energy security and its willingness to buy assets around the globe may drive up costs for other energy importers like India, Japan, South Korea and Europe. They will have to compete with China through a combination of co-operation, conservation and technological advances. But Xi maintains that China's investments are creating development opportunities for the rest of Asia and the world. ""The rest of Asia and the world cannot enjoy prosperity and stability without China,"" Xi told the Boao Forum held on the Chinese island of Hainan island last month. Next week, Xi will visit the oil and gas-rich countries of Mexico and Trinidad & Tobago. He will follow that with a two-day summit with U.S. President Barack Obama in California on June 7-8, where a packed agenda of political and commercial issues almost certainly will touch on energy. China's big three state-owned oil and gas entities CNPC, CNOOC and Sinopec already are investors in North American energy assets. There has been a spate of Chinese oil and gas investments in Africa, the Middle East, Russia and Australia -- part of a multi-pronged push for the world's second largest economy to meet its energy needs. In Moscow, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to cooperate on oil and gas pipeline developments from Siberia to China, while state-owned Rosneft struck a deal with China's biggest oil and gas producer, China National Petroleum Corp, giving CNPC access to Arctic resources. CNPC also agreed to buy more oil from Rosneft under a new 25-year loan deal, and to work with Russia's biggest gas exporter Gazprom on a new gas pipeline into China. ""Chinese-Russian cooperation in energy is manifold, comprehensive and full-fledged,"" Xi said. But price, technology and the environment may all conspire to limit the China-Russia energy trade. The harsh operating conditions and environmental hazards of the Arctic may limit chances for cooperation. Big projects such as Yamal LNG in northwest Siberia are behind schedule because of the limited Arctic infrastructure. As the technology improves, China stands to benefit from gas and oil shipments via the Arctic Northern Sea Route, but that will require massive investments in icebreakers and ice strengthened tankers. READ MORE: China eyes Arctic options in energy, transport . China is spreading its energy bets, not wanting to become too reliant on any one place given the volatile political situation in many energy-providing countries. Saudi Arabia has long been a valued supplier, as has Angola, while Iran and Iraq are coming back into contention. Sudan, Oman, Kuwait and Kazakhstan are other substantial exporters. Australia is emerging as a key provider to China of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its North West Shelf operations -- where CNPC has invested 10% of the future Browse project. North America could also become a competitive supplier of LNG after 2015 as a result of its shale gas bonanza that is rewriting the global energy trade outlook. CNPC and China's two other main state-owned oil and gas entities, Sinopec and CNOOC, have invested in Canadian and U.S. oil and gas projects. China has its own substantial shale gas reserves in areas such as the Sichuan and Tarim basins, of which 36 trillion cubic meters could be recoverable, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates. Besides government deals, China is leaning more on the expertise of international oil and gas majors. Shell has a government-approved production sharing contact with CNPC in a shale gas exploration block in the Sichuan basin. Chevron has begun a shale gas drilling program with Sinopec. ConocoPhillips, Total, BP and ExxonMobil also have shale aspirations in China. In the meantime, gas piped from Central Asia has been a mainstay of China's economy. This year Turkmenistan will pump more gas through its 1830 kilometer Central Asian Gas Pipeline to China. Last October, CNPC began work on one of China's biggest infrastructure projects, the $20 billion, 5000-kilometer pipeline from Xinjiang in the northwest to Fujian province on China's southeast coast. Completion is expected in 2015, and most of the gas will come from Central Asia, with about 5 billion cubic meters from Xinjiang. Later this year, there will be another option when the new 770 kilometer gas pipeline from Myanmar's Kyaukpyu port in the Bay of Bengal to Kunming in Yunnan province is expected to becoming operational, supplying up to 12 billion cubic meters a year of gas drawn mainly from Myanmar's offshore fields. All of these developments underpin one fundamental fact: China's appetite for energy is voracious, and growing.","China's new leader has taken extraordinary steps to secure future energy supplies .

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey man is under arrest after a routine traffic stop led to a search of his apartment and the discovery of bomb-making materials and weapons, Roselle Park police said. Travis Dulk, 27, was arrested early Wednesday morning and charged with unlawful possession of a weapon, unlawful possession of hollow-point ammunition and possession of cocaine and narcotics, according to police Chief Paul Morrison. Authorities seized weapons -- including an M4 assault rifle -- as well as hundreds of rounds of ammunition and canisters of black powder in a search of his apartment. ""There was no bomb that would be readily available. There were materials that could be consistent of making a device,"" Morrison said of the items discovered. ""There were at least 10-12 fully loaded magazines on a table, in plain view,"" the chief added. Dulk was stopped on a traffic violation around 4 p.m. Tuesday near the New Jersey Garden State Parkway, a statement from the police department said. Police became suspicious after noticing 9 mm bullets on the floor of the driver's side of the vehicle, the chief said. When he was searched, Dulk was found to being carrying a handgun loaded with hollow-point bullets, as well as several bags of cocaine and prescription drugs, the police statement said. Dulk initially consented to having his apartment searched but later changed his mind, Morrison said. Police got a search warrant and, with a bomb squad, conducted a midnight raid of the apartment. The apartment complex was also evacuated. Police are investigating whether the weapons recovered were legally purchased. Dulk is being held at the county jail on $115,000 bail as the investigation continues. It was not immediately clear whether he had legal representation.","Dulk was stopped for a traffic violation, police say .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Army sergeant was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without parole for gunning down five fellow service members at a combat stress clinic in Iraq. The sentence handed down at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Washington, came after Sgt. John Russell pleaded guilty to the killings in a deal in which prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty. Russell pleaded guilty to the May 11, 2009, killings at Baghdad's Camp Liberty, telling a military court last month that he ""did it out of rage."" The only question facing the judge, Col. David Conn, was whether Russell committed the slayings with premeditation, which the 48-year-old soldier disputed. During a brief sentencing hearing, Conn ruled Russell killed with premeditation,"" meaning the sergeant could not be given a lesser sentence. As part of last month's plea agreement, Russell described to the court how he killed Navy Cmdr. Charles Springle, Army Maj. Matthew Houseal, Sgt. Christian Bueno-Galdos, Spec. Jacob Barton and Pfc. Michael Yates Jr. It was the first time Russell had publicly detailed what happened at the clinic. Russell, a communications specialist, was on his third deployment to Iraq. His attorneys argued Russell suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and a brain injury from previous combat, which make him not fully responsible for the killings. As part of the sentence, Russell was reduced in rank to a private and ordered dishonorably discharged from the Army, Maj. Barbara Junius, a military spokeswoman, said.","A judge finds that Sgt.

"London, England (CNN) -- A collection of wills reveals Karl Marx died a poor man and Charles Darwin left behind a large estate, an ancestry website said Wednesday. The England and Wales National Probate Calendar, 1861-1941, reveals the value of more than 6 million estates, including some left by famous people. It was published online Wednesday for the first time by Ancestry.co.uk. The records show the anti-capitalist Marx died in 1883 leaving 250 pounds (23,000 pounds today) -- $395 ($36,000 today) -- to his youngest daughter, Eleanor. The famous Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton left even less on his death in 1922 -- just 556 pounds (20,000 pounds today) -- $878 ($31,600 today). The website said he lost his fortune in failed money-making schemes while allegedly trying to recapture the adventure of his youth. Darwin, by contrast, left a personal estate worth 146,911 pounds (around 13 million pounds today) -- $232,000 ($20.5 million today) -- when he died in 1882, the website said. ""Probate"" refers to the court's authority to adminster a deceased person's estate. That power lay with the church until 1857, when the state took it over and began putting together the records published Wednesday, Ancestry.co.uk said. The records show the average value of a person's will during the period was 3,400 pounds ($5,363), with some wills leaving as little as 10 pounds ($15.75), the website said. Entries also reveal details about the fate of the deceased, such as Edward John Smith, captain of the Titanic. His will says he was ""lost at sea,"" along with passengers Bejamin Guggenheim and John Astor, and the ship's builder, Thomas Andrews. The wills show John Cadbury, who created the eponymous chocolate empire, left a personal estate of 43,773 pounds (around 4.2 million pounds today) -- $69,000 ($6.6 million) -- when he died in 1889. Several famous authors left substantial estates when they died, according to the records. Charles Dickens, author of Oliver Twist and Great Expectations, left ""effects under 80,000 pounds"" (around 7.1 million pounds today) -- $126,000 ($11.2 million today) -- when he died in 1870. The author of the Sherlock Holmes detective stories, Arthur Conan Doyle, died in 1931 with 63,491 pounds (3,000,000 pounds today) -- $100,000 ($4.7 million today). A smaller but still notable amount was in the estate left by Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. He died in 1898 leaving 4,145 pounds (450,000 pounds today) -- $6,500 ($710,000 today). The database can be useful to those researching their family history, helping them learn more about their relative's social standing and worldly possessions, Ancestry.co.uk said. In addition to the estate's value, each entry may also include the name of the deceased person, the date and place of their death, and, in some cases, bequest recipients.","The wills are published online for the first time .

"(CNN) -- The first weekend of this year's Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival was blessed by gorgeous sunny weather -- until a sandstorm swept through the desert Sunday night. The swirling dust clouds prompted Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis to quip, ""I feel like Lawrence of Arabia. ... I'm going to go home and throw up a sandbox for my small child."" One of his band mates -- it was hard to see which through the haze -- added, ""I feel like Woody Guthrie during the Dust Bowl."" The Chili Peppers, who were headlining Coachella for the third time, soldiered through cuts from their current album, ""I'm With You,"" mixed with hits like ""Under the Bridge,"" ""Dani California"" and ""Give it Away."" An enthusiastic crowd sang along, their voices slightly muffled by the scarves and pieces of clothing they'd pulled over their noses and mouths. A few resourceful concertgoers even managed to get their hands on surgical masks. Ironically, the weather conditions seemed to benefit electronic artist Derek Vincent Smith, who goes by the moniker Pretty Lights. Performing in the adjacent Outdoor Theatre, his show featured a dazzling display of lasers and lights, whose brilliant hues were enhanced by the dusty backdrop. The most coveted souvenirs from Sunday night were Wu-Tang beachballs. The legendary rap icons kicked it old-school, tossing out oversized black-and-yellow inflatables stamped with the group's trademark ""W."" In the crowd, three blonde girls tussled over one beachball, while a man nearby hugged his tightly against a chainlink fence, trying to deflate it before a shirtless guy in an Indian headdress could snatch it from him. It was a scene straight out of WWE with a soundtrack provided by one of the greatest rap groups of all time. The dust hasn't even settled on this year's Coachella -- or in this case, been swept away -- but festival goers were already speculating who might appear on the 2014 bill. Disappointment ran high when this year's line-up failed to include the Rolling Stones, especially after a Coachella date briefly appeared on the Stones' website in December then mysteriously disappeared. There was speculation that the Chili Peppers were a last-minute fill-in -- a point the band not-so-subtly referenced during its Sunday night set, when it played a snippet of the Stone's ""Beast of Burden."" One act you probably won't be seeing at Coachella anytime soon -- the Smiths. Even though the band's guitarist, Johnny Marr, played three Smiths songs during his solo set on Friday, he tells CNN it isn't true that festival organizers are constantly throwing big bucks at him and Morrissey to reunite on stage. ""No,"" he says with a hint of steel in his soft speaking voice. ""It's just kind of my nature to move forward.""","A sandstorm whipped through the last day of Coachella .

"(CNN) -- Pilot William Larson and his passenger were taking aerial photos from a single-engine plane for their Virginia photography company overnight when the plane had electrical problems, police say. Minutes later, the plane slammed into the living room of a third-story suburban Washington apartment in a crash that caused no life-threatening injuries, according to Virginia State Police. The Cessna crashed into the top floor of an apartment in Herndon as the residents slept Friday, shortly after midnight, seriously injuring Larson, 61, and hurting his passenger and a woman in the apartment, state police said. Video from CNN affiliate WJLA showed the front of the plane deep into the third-floor living room, with the tail sticking outside. One of six people sleeping in the unit at the time, David Ventura, told CNN affiliate WUSA that his children slept through the crash, and that his wife had quite a shock when she left her bedroom. ""She saw the plane inside the living room and ... she was screaming and everything,"" Ventura said. ""And one of the guys that was driving the plane told her to call 911. ""But she was so nervous that she said that she got her cell phone, and she was trying to dial 911, and she couldn't because she was in shock."" Ventura's wife was taken to a hospital with unspecified injuries, and Larson's passenger, Tache L. Alejandro of Orlando, Florida, was treated at the scene for minor injuries, state police said. Larson was hospitalized with serious injuries but is expected to survive, police said. Larson and Alejandro, having taken off from Philadelphia and expecting to land in Manassas, Virginia, were taking infrared photographs from the plane when the aircraft ""experienced electrical problems and the engine cut off,"" state police said in a news release. With the plane also running low on fuel, Larson contacted Virginia's Dulles International Airport with a view to landing there, but the plane crashed in the Herndon apartment building about a mile short of Dulles, police said. The building was evacuated Friday, and the Red Cross is assisting four families, WUSA reported. Workers and a crane took the crumpled plane out of the structure and onto a flatbed truck Friday morning. The plane is registered to Aerial Photographers in Vienna, Virginia. Calls to the business weren't immediately returned. The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration were to investigate the incident, state police said.","A single-engine plane crashes into the living room of an apartment in Herndon, Virginia .

"(CNN) -- Recep Tayyip Erdogan swept into power a decade ago determined to prove to the world that his moderate Islamist party could transform Turkey's economy. His track record stands on its own. Double digit inflation has been reigned in. Turkey remains a magnet for foreign direct investment -- over $100 billion since 2003 -- and it is an export machine. Exports hit $152 billion last year, a ten-fold increase in the last ten years. READ MORE: Is Turkey the next Arab Spring? Turkey was very proud of a series of credit rating upgrades this year, the latest by Moody's on May 16 to investment grade. ""[In] the past decade the success has been partially about a single party government,"" said Tim Ash, head of emerging markets for Standard Bank. ""But Erdogan has been a key part of that success. He has vision, drive and his supporters united around him and push for the agenda he is building."" The AK Party machine has lined up behind their man, but Ash and others say that these protests illustrate that clearly something is missing. One protestor after another articulated that their prime minister is not acting in their best interests. What's driving unrest and protests in Turkey? Erdogan has never shied away from power. He challenged and took power away from Turkey's military leadership, the guardians of the secular state. He comfortably won three elections, the latest two years ago. But the former semi-professional footballer and mayor of Istanbul, analysts say, does not seem content with his first decade in power. 2023 marks the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey under the founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. WATCH MORE: The week that changed Turkey . Erdogan said he wants Turkey to join the ranks of the top ten economies by that anniversary. It is number 17 according to the International Monetary Fund after seeing a three-fold increase since 2003 to three quarters of a trillion dollars in total GDP. Per capita income has soared during his time as prime minister and the government says a million jobs are being created each year. So why have protestors taken to the streets in the thousands? It seems to be the prime minister's grand plans that are being pursued ahead of the 2023 anniversary. Major infrastructure projects include a multi-billion dollar new airport for Istanbul, new bridges to cross the Bosphorus and even a 40 kilometre canal to unclog tanker traffic on the famous strait, which straddles Europe and Asia.

The current president Abdullah Gul said during the height of the protests Monday that: ""I want it to be known that the messages sent in good faith have been received."" That was seen as a conciliatory response to what has been days of protests.

"(CNN) -- Carl Hall shouldn't be at the Big Dance, and it has nothing to do with the Wichita State Shockers being the Cinderellas of this year's tournament. Hall is an underdog story all by himself. Now 26 and allowed to play only via a special NCAA medical waiver, there was a time Hall thought he'd never play basketball again. But through the diligence and tenacity that has been a signature of the No. 9-seeded Shockers' historic run into the Final Four (they're the second-lowest seed to ever make it this far), Hall has demonstrated he was game for a comeback. When the 6-foot-8 senior from Cochran, Georgia, first took the floor in 2007 to play at Middle Georgia College, his college career lasted all of three games. After visiting a doctor to diagnose the latest in a series of fainting spells that had been ongoing since high school, his career was shut down because of a heart condition. The condition caused what is known as neurocardiogenic syncope, a loss of consciousness often caused by decreased blood to the brain. Remember when President George W. Bush choked on the pretzel in 2002? Or when French President Nicolas Sarkozy collapsed while jogging in 2009? Both episodes were attributed to syncope. Like that, Hall went from junior-college baller to a $12-an-hour, assembly-line bulb painter working the graveyard shift at a lighting company in his hometown. It was a tough blow for the then-19-year-old. ""He got so depressed,"" his mother, Jackie Fields, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""For a while there, I thought, 'This boy thinks his life was over.' "" Hall stayed in school, paying his own way after losing his scholarship, and attended morning classes after his shifts ended at 7 a.m. His grades suffered, according to media reports. The best teams that didn't win it all . In 2009, doctors gave him exciting news. His medication was working. His heart was stabilizing. If he wanted, he could return to the court, they said, but Hall was tentative. ""Once you pass out you don't want to go through that situation again,"" Hall told Yahoo Sports. Rather than go back to college, he went to the rec center, where he began playing in a church league. When coach Scott Moe heard of the development, he told Hall he could return to Middle Georgia, the Journal-Constitution reported. Fields was worried it wasn't the best move for her son, but Hall told her he was willing to take the risk. ""I said if anything happens to me while I play basketball, I can live with it,"" Hall told the newspaper. ""She said if I can live with it, she can."" He averaged almost 19 points and more than 11 rebounds a game, leading Middle Georgia to the national junior college tournament. The next year, he transferred to Northwest Florida State, where that production continued. With a marksman-like 59% shooting, Hall averaged almost 18 points and 10 rebounds a game -- not to mention 2.3 blocks -- and was named 2011 Panhandle Conference Player of the Year. By then, he'd already been on Wichita State coach Gregg Marshall's radar. Marshall recalled for ESPN the first time he saw the young man play. ""I said to my staff, 'I want that guy right there. The guy with the hair,' "" Marshall said, referring to the dreadlocks Hall sported up until a few days before the NCAA Tournament. Marshall had his reservations, though. It wasn't that Hall didn't have what it took to be a Shocker, but Marshall had been rocked by a player's heart problem in the past. Just after accepting the Wichita State post, Marshall was watching one of his recruits, a Cameroonian from New Hampshire named Guy Alang-Ntang, play a pick-up game when the kid collapsed, dead on the floor. ""I'm watching him play pickup and 15 minutes later he just lurches back and it's over. That was my second day on the job,"" he told ESPN. Despite Hall's successes at Middle Georgia and Northwest Florida, he wasn't quite up for the task of playing NCAA ball. He was out of shape, sometimes taking breaks during team sprints, and he was frightened to push himself at first. Marshall was also unwilling to crack the whip. ""I didn't want to be the coach who made him pass out or worse,"" Marshall told ESPN. Hall spent the off-season on the track, on the treadmill and on the stationary bike. During a preseason practice, he was running suicides -- a grueling series of sprints whose lengths increase in intervals -- when he realized he could finally give it 100%, according to the Journal-Constitution. He's now making the most of the NCAA medical waivers that granted him a sixth season of eligibility. After averaging more than eight points and five rebounds as a junior -- and snaring the Missouri Valley Conference's newcomer of the year award -- the 26-year-old forward has become a force. On top of 12.5 points and seven rebounds a game, Hall plays mean defense, averaging almost two blocks a game. You can ask the No. 2-seeded Ohio State Buckeyes about it -- that is, if they're willing to talk after Hall's six swatted shots helped the Shockers sink the favored Big Ten opponent last weekend. That upset came two days after a 72-58 dismantling of the LaSalle Explorers -- on the back of Hall's 16-point, eight-rebound, three-block performance -- and a week after the Shockers lived up to their name by edging out the Gonzaga Bulldogs, one of the tournament's top-seeded teams. Next up is perhaps Wichita State's most daunting challenge: a truly menacing Louisville Cardinals team that hasn't lost since February 9 and is averaging almost 81 points per game in the tournament. With the exception of Oregon, which lost to Louisville by eight, no one has even stayed on the floor with the Cardinals, who whipped a vaunted Duke squad by 22 on Sunday. The Shockers will go into Atlanta's Georgia Dome on Saturday as 11-point underdogs, but Wichita State is used to playing the role. They've already knocked off one No. 1 seed on the road to the college hoops championship. Should they continue to defy the oddsmakers and win it all, the Kansas university of almost 15,000 students will become the lowest-seeded school to ever do it, topping the 1985 No. 8-seeded Villanova team. But that's getting ahead of ourselves. Right now, Hall is just enjoying being there. ""It's like I'm in a dream right now, you know, and I'm just trying to take advantage of this whole opportunity,"" he told ESPN.","Carl Hall's heart condition threatened to end his college basketball career in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Meet football's answer to Tintin. He was the silver-haired striker whose goals propelled Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain to European glory. Eric Castel was a hero to boys across the continent, his exploits at the Camp Nou and the Parc des Princes cementing his status as a football and comic book icon. And ahead of Wednesday's European Champions League quarterfinal second leg, memories of a winger who brought joy to fans of both teams will be thrust sharply into focus. Former Barcelona president Joan Laporta called Castel the club's greatest ever signing, while current Barca playmaker Xavi is among his legion of loyal fans. Join the CNN Football Club . Castel's career flowed through the pencil of Raymond Reding, whose vibrant illustrations captivated a generation of youngsters. The French star was known by different names across Europe -- Ronnie Hansen in the Netherlands, Kai Falke in Germany -- but he was always brought to life by the hand of Reding, who died in April 1999. Reding, while also working on other make-believe sporting heroes, spent time working on Belgium's favorite young adventurer Tintin during the 1950s. ""With Francoise Hugues, Raymond Reding created this character in 1973 with a football player named Max Falk,"" football agent and Castel enthusiast Olivier Jouanneaux told CNN. ""He played in a company football team, not as a professional, in Dusseldorf, Germany. ""The Dutch comic magazine Zack ordered Reding to create a comic about football to be published in 1974, the same year Germany hosted the World Cup."" Characters such as Castel have always been a staple for football fans throughout the years. English youngsters were held in thrall by the trials and tribulations of Roy Race, the eponymous hero of the ""Roy of the Rovers"" series who dazzled during decades with the fictional Melchester Rovers club. Castel's career began in 1979, the year the real Barca team lifted the European Cup Winners' Cup, and his story was told across 15 albums running until 1992 -- the year the Catalans became champions of Europe for the first time. ""Nothing sounds better for a younger Barca supporter than a comic hero who wears the shirt of his team and lives so many adventures,"" says filmmaker Uri Garcia, who is hoping to produce a documentary about Castel. ""On the other hand, as seen in the comics, the drawing style of Reding is very realistic and is very well documented. ""I live in Barcelona, and during my childhood I lived next to the Camp Nou. For me, as well as for many fans of Catalonia, it was very exciting and special to see your city and your football club drawn as well in a comic."" While his exploits on the pitch excited readers, it was Castel's friendship with a group of young boys which was central to his appeal. ""My favorite moment could be when Castel meets Pablito and the juniors in Tossa de Mar in the first album,"" recalls Garcia, referring to the Catalonia municipality, which is north of Barcelona. ""Castel trains with the guys in the middle of the street but they don't know that he is the new star of Barca."" Reding's portrayal of the relationship between Castel and Pablito Varela and his friends, the ""Pablitos"", allowed every young child to imagine what it would be like to befriend a soccer superstar. ""Reding did well in creating a strong relationship between Castel and the 'Pablitos' despite their age differences,"" says Jouanneaux, who is a FIFA agent. ""Everyone can find himself in this comic. A child can dream to live events like the 'Pablitos' did."" True cule . As with all good stories, Castel's career took a sudden twist in 1984 when the goalscorer signed for PSG. ""As a French citizen, I was happy to see him at a French club,"" says Jouanneaux. ""That was a big success for the French championship and also the possibility to see French stadiums and teams. ""On the other hand, this move was a little disappointing. Everybody wondered, could his relationship with the 'Pablitos' continue?"" Castel's transfer came back to haunt the fictional Barca team in edition eight after he powered PSG to victory in the CEVA Cup, a made up European competition, beating the Catalan club in the final. Castel fans were outraged. The character had never won the CEVA Cup with Barca and now he had extinguished his former club's hopes. ""The whole affair led to outrage among followers of the series, who were devastated by Raymond Reding and Françoise Hugues' decision to transfer Eric Castel to Paris Saint-Germain,"" said Barca's official website. ""Not only that, but to also have him participate in the defeat of Barça in the most important club competition in Europe."" Having spent issues eight and nine in the French capital, and after Barca lowered their financial demands, Castel made an emotional return to the Catalan club. His comeback was the stuff of dreams for young Barca and Castel fans. In 1988, four years after leaving the Nou Camp, Castel finally fired the club to CEVA Cup success. ""I liked so much the moment when Barça wins the final of CEVA with a penalty from Eric in the 12th album 12,"" says Garcia. ""In the 1980s Barça had never won the Champions League. It was a great time to be a Barca supporter. ""Before Barça became the great Barça that it is today, a Belgian illustrator took a chance on this club by making the hero of his comic, a fictional French footballer called Eric Castel, a player for the team. ""Castel quickly became an idol for many young readers in the '80s, all over the world."" In reality Barca and PSG are both attempting to conquer Europe, with Wednesday's second leg tie in Barcelona delicately poised after the first leg in Paris finished 2-2. If he were still around today, who would Castel want to advance to the semfinals? ""I believe that Eric is a Barça supporter,"" responds Garcia. ""He is a real cule.""","Eric Castel was a comic book hero who starred for Barcelona and PSG .

"(CNN) -- Since China adopted a ""managed float"" of the renminbi (RMB) in 2005, the RMB has appreciated in real terms by over 20 per cent against the U.S. dollar. Still, politicians and economists in the U.S. say China is guilty of ""currency manipulation"" and say the RMB remains artificially undervalued. The U.S. Senate on Thursday voted to push a bill which will impose punitive tariffs on China for allegedly manipulating the RMB exchange rate to gain unfair trade advantage. U.S. President Barack Obama said China is manipulating its currency but expressed concerns about backing the Senate bill. China opposes the bill, warning that it ""seriously violates rules of the World Trade Organization and obstructs China-U.S. trade ties."" U.S. Republican House Speaker John Boehner does not support the bill either. ""This is well beyond what Congress ought to be doing, and while I've got concerns about how the Chinese have dealt with their currency, I'm not sure this is the way to fix it,"" he said Tuesday. What is the currency dispute all about? This week I talked with Patrick Chovanec, an associate professor at Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management and a former aide to House Speaker Boehner, to seek answers to my nine questions. 1) How serious is the U.S. trade deficit with China? U.S. trade deficit with China has steadily grown over the past decade. In 2010, it reached $273 billion, over 40% of America's global trade deficit, but still amounted to less than 2% of GDP. In fact, America's global trade deficit peaked in 2006 and has declined substantially, largely due to expanding exports. The real problem isn't so much the absolute size of the U.S.-China trade imbalance, but the struggle to find sources of growth in a stagnant global economy. 2) The U.S. will hold a presidential election next year. How is the trade dispute with China playing out in America? The number one election issue is going to be jobs, so every politician wants to show that they're doing something about jobs. China's trade imbalance with the U.S. is a real issue: If China's markets were more open, if it was encouraging consumer demand instead of piling up reserves, it could help boost job growth in the U.S. So there's a temptation to seize on China's currency policy as a ""silver bullet"" that will solve this concern, by making U.S. goods cheaper and Chinese ones more expensive, even though the real problem is more complex than that. 3) What impact will the Senate bill have if passed? The immediate concern would be retaliation, provoking a trade war with China. Even if China didn't opt for actual retaliation, it could challenge the U.S. sanctions with the World Trade Organization, and China might very well win. One of the reasons the U.S. has always hesitated in slapping sanctions on China over currency is the fear that we might be shooting blanks. 4) Why so? It's far from clear that twisting China's arm to strengthen its currency will have the effect we might hope. We've actually seen this movie before. In the Plaza Accord in 1985, Japan agreed, under considerable U.S. pressure, to strengthen its currency in order to combat the growing U.S. trade deficit. The yen doubled in value, but to everyone's surprise, it had virtually no impact on the trade balance, because there were subsidies, trade barriers, and other policies in place in Japan that countered the stronger yen and prevented an adjustment from taking place. Back China into a corner and force it to accept a stronger yuan, without embracing the kind of economic adjustment that really requires, and I'm afraid we'll see a replay of the Plaza Accord. 5) What is the fundamental reason causing the trade deficit? The cheap yuan is one factor, but it's only one piece of the puzzle. Other factors include obstacles to market access, China's failure to protect intellectual property rights, export tax rebates, subsidized inputs, subsidized credit, and soft budget constraints for Chinese state-owned companies. There are a whole host of factors in the Chinese economy besides currency that distort price signals in favor of exports and discourage imports. To their credit, American negotiators have been placing more and more emphasis on these issues lately, rather than focusing exclusively on currency as some kind of ""silver bullet."" 6) Why should China revalue the renminbi? When China intervenes to keep the yuan from rising, in order to protect export growth, it ends up accumulating trillions of dollars in official reserves that it has to somehow invest, leaving it exposed to losses. It also injects trillions of yuan into its domestic economy, fueling inflation and asset bubbles. The fact is, when you run massive trade and investment imbalances, as China is doing, you're going to get an adjustment, one way or the other. It's either going to take place through external prices (exchange rates) or internal prices (inflation). 7) What will be the pros and cons for China? There will be losers. Some Chinese exporters, especially those with razor-thin margins and no reliable competitive advantage, may lose their markets and go out of business. But there will be winners too. A stronger yuan would give the average Chinese citizen greater buying power and an improved standard of living. 8) Some observers argue that, if the renminbi revalues and the Chinese exports to the U.S. become expensive, the American consumers will have to pay more for them -- and thus will be hurt too. Your view? That's absolutely true. Just as a stronger yuan will mean that Chinese consumers will enjoy greater buying power, American consumers will lose some of the buying power they've enjoyed over Chinese goods. Their dollars will buy less. But the focus in America right now is on jobs, not buying power. The problem this past decade is that Americans' buying power has led us to consume more than we produce, which means more than we could ultimately afford, and as we've all come to learn, that's just not sustainable. 9) Will further revaluation of the renminbi help stop the loss of jobs in the U.S.? A stronger yuan is not going to bring back jobs in labor-intensive, low-tech industries where the U.S. has no real competitive advantage. Those jobs will go to Bangladesh or Vietnam before they come back to the U.S. But a Chinese consumer with greater buying power -- if accompanied by greater openness and fairer treatment for American companies in the Chinese market -- will translate into more opportunities and more jobs in sectors where the U.S. has a real advantage. Twisting China's tail won't get us there, however. A market-based exchange rate has to be part of a more comprehensive win-win solution.","The U.S. Senate considers imposing punitive tariffs on China for allegedly manipulating the RMB .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- As political comebacks go, Nawaz Sharif's is among the more remarkable. He served two terms as Pakistan's prime minister in the 1990s before he was overthrown in a military coup and banished into the political hinterlands. After a Pakistani court sentenced him to life in prison for hijacking and terrorism, he managed to negotiate his way into exile in Saudi Arabia, where he remained for seven years, waiting for the political tides to shift and allow his return. On Wednesday, he completed his long journey back to power and became prime minister for an unprecedented third term. The Pakistani National Assembly, where his political party secured control in elections last month, elected him prime minister with 244 votes. Later Wednesday, he took the oath of office from President Asif Ali Zardari, one of his longtime political rivals whose term ends later this year. Zardari's Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) had been in government since 2008. This year, it became the first elected administration in the country's history to successfully see out a full term in office and hand over power democratically. But that milestone didn't help the PPP at the ballot box last month. Following a term plagued by corruption allegations, militant violence, economic torpor and power shortages, its support fell away in an election marred by extremist attacks on candidates. Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, on the other hand, performed strongly, capitalizing on his image as a flag-bearer for private industry and entrepreneurship with promises to revive the country's economic fortunes. Stern challenges . Now, as he takes the reins of government again, he will have to face up to Pakistan's raft of daunting challenges. His economic stewardship will be quickly put to the test. Analysts say Sharif, the scion of an industrial family and one of the country's richest people, has typically favored large, showy infrastructure projects such as highways as a way to spur economic activity. But with Pakistani's public finances in a fragile state, finding the funds for big building plans could prove difficult, observers say. He also has the complex task of resolving the country's energy crisis, which has resulted in prolonged power outages that hurt businesses and sometimes provoke street protests. The security situation in the country remains a severe problem, as the widespread attacks during the elections by the Pakistani Taliban and other extremists showed. Sharif has floated the idea of holding talks with the Taliban, but some analysts say the country's powerful military, with whom Sharif has clashed in the past, will hold the final word on key security and foreign policy decisions. Stance on drones? Until Wednesday, when he called for an end to drone strikes, his stance on the United States' unpopular program in Pakistan's tribal areas that border Afghanistan was unclear. ""The campaign of drone strikes should be shut down,"" Sharif said in his acceptance speech. ""We must work together to ensure Pakistan's sovereignty."" Imran Khan, the former cricket star whose young party has become one of the main opposition groups in parliament, has called on Sharif to bring an end to the U.S. program. Sharif has condemned drone strikes in the past, including the one last week that killed the Pakistani Taliban's No. 2 leader. But analysts say he had good working relations with the United States during his previous terms in office and is likely to take a similarly pragmatic approach once back in power. He has said he will pursue closer ties with Pakistan's neighbor and archrival, India. During his second term as prime minister, in the late 1990s, Sharif oversaw Pakistan's emergence as a nuclear power, for which many Pakistanis still hold him in high regard. It remains to be seen what his third term will be remembered for. CNN's Shaan Khan reported from Islamabad, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","Nawaz Sharif is sworn in as prime minister Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- China will sometimes say ""no"" and the world should get used to it. That message came through last weekend when China, one of five permanent U.N. Security Council members, joined Russia in blocking action on Syria. Their vetoes derailed a draft resolution condemning Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's 11-month-old attempt to crush opposition groups and demanding an end to attacks on peaceful protesters. ""Do not mistakenly think that because China takes a careful and responsible position on this [Syria] issue, China will not use its veto power or will always abstain,"" said Cui Tiankai, China's vice foreign minister. ""When China must use its veto power, it will surely use it."" On Saturday, Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, called the vetoes ""disgusting and shameful."" ""Those that have blocked potentially the last effort to resolve this peacefully ... will have any future blood spill on their hands,"" she said after the voting. But Cui said there is nothing unusual for the five permanent members of the Security Council to disagree on certain issues. Speaking at a press briefing Thursday on the eve of a visit to the United States by Xi Jinping, the Chinese vice president, Cui said America's displeasure over China's veto will not affect China-U.S. cooperation on other international issues. In China, the veto was hailed by local media as a significant change in Beijing's diplomatic tack. ""Abstaining is no longer always a choice as China is forced to speak out,"" according to an editorial in the state-run Global Times, an official English-language daily. ""China needs to speak out. Hiding its true thinking does not help avoid trouble."" The Global Times said China's veto does not indicate a China-Russia alliance. ""Both China and Russia have their own interests and dignity,"" it added. He Wenping, director of African Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said the veto shows China's confidence in foreign affairs. ""A country expressing its true opinion -- that's progress,"" he said. So why did China use its veto this time? ""China opposes the use of threat or force to achieve regime change in other countries,"" said He Wenping. ""This is consistent with China's long-standing diplomacy principle. It is also not acceptable for China to rush a [U.N.] vote without sufficient consultation."" China, she added, does not wish see a reprise of what she considers a debacle over Libya. ""On Libya, NATO misused the rights given by the U.N. resolution about setting up the no-fly zone, which was then turned into 'regime change' in Libya,"" she said. Ruan Zongze, a senior researcher at the China Institute of International Studies, agreed: ""What concerns China most is possible regime change and foreign military intervention,"" he said. ""We ask the international community to give more space and time for dialogue within Syria."" On February 6, the state-run People's Daily wrote in an editorial: ""It is Syrian people's democratic right to choose a government they want. But hatred and separatists will remain a challenge no matter who is ruling, the government has to stabilize the country and protect people's safety. It will still come down to the problem of peace among nations and tribes."" China is ranked as the third-largest supplier of imports to Syria in 2010, according to data from the European Commission. But local experts downplay the scale of China's stakes and national interests in Syria. ""Compared with Russia, China does not have that much interest in Syria and in the Middle East,"" He Wenping said. ""Of course, in the greater Middle East, we need and we depend on the energy, say, the oil coming from the region."" Liu Weimin, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, rejected criticisms of China's veto. ""China does not have its own selfish interest on the issue of Syria,"" he said in a news conference. ""We do not deliberately shelter or oppose any country. Instead, we uphold justice in dealing with the issue."" But China's critics say China's veto of the U.N. draft resolution was in part due to Beijing's fear that allowing a regime change in Syria could encourage the spread of the Arab revolution and eventually threaten China. He Wenping disagrees. ""In my opinion, more than 99% of Chinese do not want to see an Arab Spring revolution in China, and they do not believe that there will be one in China,"" she says. ""China has a completely different political system and economic development path. If someone in the international community thinks that the Arab Spring will happen in China, then I think they misjudge the situation in China, exaggerate some problems in the Chinese society and underestimate the ability of the Chinese government to control the situation in China."" As to Ambassador Susan Rice's blunt reaction to China's and Russia's vetoes, He Wenping quips: ""I think the statement shows utter lack of diplomatic protocol. The statement itself is disgusting.""","China joined Russia in using its veto to block a U.N. Security Council draft resolution on Syria .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- The opening theme's the same and the concept's no different, but ""Arab Idol"" is much more than just a popular singing competition. Now in its second season, the Middle Eastern version of ""American Idol"" is the feel-good story of the year. At a time when the Arab world is so concerned about conflicts growing and sectarianism increasing, the show has done the near impossible: It's given the troubled region something to smile about. ""You should vote for, only for music,"" a grinning and relaxed Ahmad Jamal says during rehearsal. ""Not for nationality, not for religion, not for political issues,"" adds the 25-year-old Egyptian contestant. ""You just vote for music and the one you love, the one you want to be a star."" It's a sentiment echoed by other contestants when explaining the popularity of the show and how lucky they feel to be a part of it. Take Farah Youssef, for example. The 25-year-old almost didn't make it out of Syria. Her car was caught in the middle of a shootout as she left Damascus to audition in Beirut. Watching her practice before the show, you'd never guess the amount of stress she's under. Frankly, she seems quite happy while hitting the high notes. As it turns out, the pressure of performing is nothing compared with how overcome she becomes when she thinks and talks about the civil war back home. ""I see all that stuff happening in my country,"" she says. ""It's kind of devastating."" Her words trail off as she is overcome with emotion. ""I'm sorry,"" she says as she starts to cry. ""The people, they have no future. I thank my God that I'm here, I'm building myself up, I'm trying to be good. I'm trying to make people love one another again."" Suddenly, as if remembering the healing power of music, she declares, ""And actually I feel like I'm doing a good job."" Clearly the show's millions of loyal viewers believe so too, as Youssef has advanced to ""Arab Idol's"" finale, which airs this weekend. But she has stiff competition from fan favorite Mohamad Assaf, also a finalist -- one who's become a heartthrob and a hero. Making the difficult journey out of Gaza, the 23-year-old Palestinian barely made it to the tryouts in Cairo. When he arrived at a hotel for the tryouts, he was late and had to jump over a wall and evade security to enter the venue. ""There was a man who gave me his number -- who sacrificed his place for my sake when he heard my voice,"" Assaf recalls. ""I still ask myself how all this happened."" Nicknamed ""The Rocket,"" Assaf's on a fast track to stardom, but the patriotic Palestinian also wants to inspire his people. ""Anybody who has hope for a better future, and who has dreams and ambitions to make his dreams a reality, will make it,"" he says confidently. ""Arab Idol"" Executive Producer Alex Meouchy couldn't be happier about the effect the show's having. ""I'm very proud of the success of the show,"" he says. ""I'm very proud that we were able to achieve something that all of the Arab world was able to unite around."" Broadcast on the MBC1 network, the show's stellar ratings have increased all season long. ""Arab Idol"" is now considered a sensation. On the show, contestants, regardless of their religious or cultural background, sing songs from all over the region. Meouchy explains how the diversity on display has made the show even more popular: . ""An Egyptian (contestant) would come and say I want to sing in Lebanese (dialect),"" he says, ""and I want to sing in Gulf dialect and it's really quite beautiful how ... the unity of the Arab world was shown in the show through the power of songs and entertainment."" This season even featured the show's first Kurdish contestant, Parwas Hussein. Even the show's panel of judges, made up of music superstars of the Arab world, prefers to be positive. ""We are the real leader now,"" explains head judge Ragheb Alama, known as the ""Elvis of Lebanon."" ""People are talking to us and watching us. You know, today, two (regional) presidents called me and talked to me about this program, about the contestants."" ""You cannot imagine how this makes me feel that we are the real medicine,"" says Alama, ""the real smile between the sad environments."" Perhaps it's all summed up best by former Lebanese contestant Ziad Khoury. ""We're sending a message and unifying the Arab people,"" the beaming 25-year-old says. ""A message of happiness and peace."" Here, they've decided to focus on excellence rather than extremism, to highlight music instead of misery.","Middle Eastern version of ""American Idol"" is the feel-good story of the year .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have wrapped up their search at the home that once belonged to New York gangster James ""Jimmy the Gent"" Burke after finding material that ""may be human remains"" under the floor, a law enforcement source with knowledge of an investigation at the home said Thursday. Investigators at Ozone Park in Queens finished the search Wednesday night for human remains possibly connected to a case that happened before 1996, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It will be a few days before the FBI learns from forensic testing by the medical examiner's office if the remains are human, the source said. According to public records, the house is now owned by Burke's daughter, Catherine Burke, who declined Tuesday to comment to CNN. James Burke died in 1996. According to his obituary in the New York Times, he was serving a 20-years-to-life sentence in a New York prison when he fell ill with cancer. Robert De Niro played Burke as Jimmy Conway in the 1990 Martin Scorsese classic mafia film ""Goodfellas,"" and Burke is likely best known as the alleged mastermind of the 1978 Lufthansa heist, an $8 million robbery at John F. Kennedy International Airport, which was the largest robbery in history at the time. But the source said that Burke and his cohorts, closely associated with top members of the Lucchese crime family, also were allegedly involved in a number of other activities -- so the search in Queens may not be related to the Lufthansa heist. Jim Margolin, a spokesman for the FBI's New York office, told CNN on Tuesday, without elaborating, that investigators were ""conducting a search at a home in Queens in connection to an investigation.""","Source: The FBI is awaiting forensic test results to determine if the remains are human .

"(CNN) -- Her Colorado home destroyed by a natural disaster, Trudy Dawson stops to think about fire and water. She is thinking about the wildfire that reduced her house near Colorado Springs to ashes this week and about the water that Hurricane Katrina pushed into her childhood home eight years ago. ""I sit back and reflect on the difference between flood and fire,"" Dawson said. The 16,000-acre Black Forest Fire in Colorado claimed two lives and 500 structures. Comparing what she witnessed at her parents' home in New Orleans when it was flooded by Katrina and the fire that engulfed her own home, Dawson knows which is worse. The fire. With the flood, her family was able to salvage many items, even if they were waterlogged. The structure still stood. ""It was total destruction this time,"" she said of her Colorado home. ""Everything was ashes. We were told by the fire chief that the intensity of the heat made my three-story house collapse."" Dawson, a psychotherapist, was at work on Monday when her daughter, who happened to be in town, alerted her to the fire. Dawson got to her house in time to see the plumes of smoke and to receive the reverse-911 call to evacuate. She gave herself 30 minutes to get out. She and her daughter started with the electronics -- the computers and tablets that hold important records. Then the physical documents in her possession. Time was ticking. They started grabbing clothes from the closets, not really paying attention to whether the items would actually be helpful. ""Emotions override any logic at that point,"" she said. Dawson has two cats but could find only one. She had no way to transport the two horses she owns. She had to leave. The horses survived, but every day Dawson remembers another special item that disappeared in the fire. She thinks: If she had just spent a few more minutes at her home, she could have saved some more treasured possessions. But, she has heard, the two victims who perished had waited too long to evacuate, possibly trying to save those memorable items. Thinking back to Katrina, Dawson recalls the look in her parents' eyes when they returned to their flooded home to see their losses. There were six inches of sludge on the floor, and the family entered with boots and gloves, looking at what survived. They found her father's World War II medals. And a china doll that had fallen from its case to the ground but had not broken. The story of the doll, which they named Katrina, was even featured in the Wall Street Journal. The doll still holds water that seeped in during the time it was submerged. After this week's fire, though, there was nothing left of her house. Just a foundation and ashes. ""We walked around the house in amazement and horrified at what we saw,"" she said. Beyond reflecting on the destructive powers of water and fire, however, Dawson is unwavering on her next step. She will rebuild.","Trudy Dawson lost her family home in Katrina, and her own home in a wildfire this week .

"(CNN) -- Imagine James Gandolfini as a man weary of the world -- resigned to the fact that his remaining days will be filled with regret and longing. And yet he still has hopes. He is not passive. He is trying to make things right until the very end. This is not the Gandolfini of ""The Sopranos."" It's one of his last projects, ""Violet & Daisy."" Though completed in 2011, the film only gained a significant U.S. release earlier this month. Official: Gandolfini probably died of heart attack . In ""Violet & Daisy,"" Gandolfini plays a thief with no name who spends much of his time in a comfortable chair waiting to be killed. Two teenagers -- Violet (Alexis Bledel) and Daisy (Saoirse Ronan) -- are hired to murder him. Gandolfini was never less than powerful, director Geoffrey Fletcher said Thursday. ""Jim was riveting.""

Gandolfini was often still in ""Violet & Daisy."" But he remained, in his stillness, a man of powerful actions, Fletcher said. Early on in the movie's production, he and Gandolfini met in the lounge of New York's Algonquin Hotel. They opened up to each other, talking about their struggles breaking through in the business --- the many odd jobs each took to stay afloat before getting their breaks. Gandolfini shared a personal story, which Fletcher said he feels compelled to share because he believes it says so much about the actor's character. A friend of Gandolfini's was in serious financial trouble and had come to him for money. It wasn't a fortune, but a significant amount. Gandolfini told Fletcher he gave his friend the money.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Anyone interested in world affairs, Chinese diplomacy and China's future should know more about Xi Jinping. Xi (pronounced ""shee""), China's vice president, will be visiting the United States this month for meetings at the White House in Washington and will travel to other cities. ""The visit is important to boost his stature at home -- here is the man the U.S. takes seriously, and he can deal with them on our behalf,"" says Anthony Saich, a China expert at the Harvard Kennedy School. ""For the U.S., it provides an opportunity to introduce him to key U.S. politicians and the American public. The same approach was taken with Hu Jintao before he took over."" Xi, 58, is in line to be China's next paramount leader. He is expected to succeed Hu when his second term ends in autumn this year and could rule China for 10 years. But who is Xi? Some key information about him: . • He comes from a clique known as ""princelings,"" sons and daughters of revolutionary veterans. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a revolutionary hero who was banished during the Cultural Revolution. • When his father was in limbo, Xi spent time as a teenager doing manual labor in China's countryside and went on to become a local party chief. • He holds chemical engineering and law degrees from the prestigious Tsinghua University, the alma mater of Hu and other senior leaders. • He served in the People's Liberation Army as an officer in the General Office Department and assistant to the chief of the policy-making Central Military Commission. • He worked his way up from party chief to governor or party chief of three provinces -- Fujian, Zhejiang and Shanghai. • He became party chief of Shanghai in 2007 to replace Chen Liangyu, who was sacked because of a corruption scandal. • He served as a point person for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and other recent major events. • In addition to being vice president, he is a member of the communist party's secretariat and head of the Central Party School, a political training ground for party cadres. • He has been married twice, more recently to Peng Liyuan, a famous folk singer in China. Their daughter, Xi Mingze, is now enrolled at Harvard. What makes Xi click? Analysts say Xi is generally liked for his pragmatism, competence and a heritage of political reliability. ""He has avoided controversy in his career and has worked in provinces that could be deemed a success,"" Saich said. ""He appeals to the broadest range of factions within the party, he is one of them, and he is not going to upset their privileges."" ""His 'birthmark' is obviously a factor that propelled him to the top,"" says Yawei Liu, a China-watcher at the Carter Center in Atlanta. Liu also notes that Xi is generally perceived as ""unassuming and unpretentious."" Singapore's retired leader Lee Kuan Yew recalled a one-hour meeting in late 2007 and found Xi to be a thoughtful man who has been through many trials in life. ""I would put him in the Nelson Mandela's class of persons, a person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings to affect his judgment. In other words, he is impressive."" What kind of a leader might Xi be as a driver of China's foreign policy? Will he be dovish or hawkish? ""Most see him, given his previous work experience, as likely to be on the collaborative side,"" Saich said. ""People who know him say he is thoughtful and wants a good relationship with the U.S. His daughter is here, his sister is in Canada."" However, given the strong nationalistic sentiments in the military and among sections of the youth, Saich thinks ""it might make him feel that he has to be aggressive, at least to start with, to consolidate his position."" In one occasion, during a visit in Mexico in 2009, he was caught on camera chastising foreigners while speaking informally to a group of overseas Chinese. ""Some bored foreigners have nothing better to do than point their fingers at our affairs,"" he said. ""(But) China does not, first, export revolution, second, export poverty and hunger, and third, cause unnecessary trouble for them. What else is there to say?"" ""If his off--the-cuff remarks in Mexico are any reflection of his tendency, he could be hawkish in conducting Chinese foreign policy,"" says Liu of The Carter Center. Little is actually known about Xi's political views, but analysts say he shares concerns about maintaining the rule of the communist party and social stability. Recent ethnic unrest in Xinjiang and Tibet, strikes in factories and mass protests in towns and villages have made China far cry from Hu's dream of a ""harmonious society."" The rapid economic growth the leadership has depended on to claim political legitimacy and to ease social tensions has been sputtering as key export markets in the U.S. and Europe continue to shrink. ""The international and domestic situation has changed so much he will have to introduce orderly political reform to ensure the nation does not implode as a result of rampant corruption, stagnant economic growth and popular frustration over the lack of freedom of speech and government accountability,"" Liu said. Saich believes Xi's biggest challenge is how to deal with the new social media, given the divergent opinions within the Communist party. ""Some want to treat it like the old-fashioned print media and try to mimic the same kinds of controls and institutional structures,"" he explained. ""Others recognize the world is changing and that a new way of dealing with the social media and citizen participation has to be found without undermining the party's paramount position."" ""This challenge is fundamental to the future of the party,"" Saich added. Netizens are not upbeat. ""Don't expect too much change from Xi,"" said ""Berlinbear,"" a microblogger posting on Sina Weibo, a social media site in China. ""Tianxiaoyu"" writes: ""I don't really expect the Communist Party to start holding general elections, but I do hope Xi can bring some substantial reform to keep the despotic 'people's servants' within limits... I want to at least have the right to remove someone from office when I don't want him there."" Perhaps Xi can pick up pointers, good and bad, when he visits the United States.","Xi will visit the White House in Washington, travel to other U.S. cities .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A Chinese man was sentenced to death Friday for holding six women as sex slaves in an underground lair and ordering the deaths of two of them, state media reported. A court in Luoyang city convicted Li Hao on charges of murder, rape, organized prostitution, illegal detention and selling pornography, state-run Xinhua said. Li, who is married with a young son, had worked for the technological supervision bureau in the city in Henan province. The 35-year-old dug the dungeon in the basement of a residential compound he bought in 2009, the court heard, according to Xinhua. He then used the underground room to hold women he tricked into coming to the property. Police investigations indicated the six were held captive for between two and 21 months. Li repeatedly raped the women, forced them to appear in pornographic web shows from March to April 2011 and made them have sex with customers for a brief period last year, the court heard. Three of the women were also found guilty of murder over the killings of two of their fellow captives, Xinhua reported. However, the court was lenient in its judgment of the women because of the circumstances in which they were held, finding they acted under instruction, and in one case coercion, from Li. One of the women was sentenced to three years in prison and the other two were placed on probation. The women had worked at karaoke bars, hair salons and a massage shop before they were kidnapped by Li, police are cited as saying. Li's intention was to make money from selling the women's sexual services and uploading obscene videos to the Internet, the court heard. His actions were brought to light only after one of the women escaped in September last year and alerted police. Li was then arrested. Soon afterward, the head of the public security bureau in Luoyang apologized for the police failure to uncover the dungeon sooner and said they were taking new steps to clamp down on vice, according to a Xinhua report at the time.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- On Saturday at 6:37 p.m. (6:37 a.m. ET), China is scheduled to launch its first female astronaut into space as part of a three-person crew. Liu Yang will join Jing Haipeng and Liu Wang as part of a three-person crew aboard the Shenzhou-9 spacecraft, which, if successful, will conduct a historic docking with China's orbiting space module. Like Wang Yaping, the other woman considered for the coveted slot, Liu Yang is married, in her early 30s and chosen among China's first batch of women astronauts because of her strong flying record and mental toughness. The launch of China's first woman taikonaut (which combines the Chinese ""taikong,"" or space, and the Greek ""nautes,"" or sailor) into space would come exactly 49 years to the day that the former Soviet Union put its first woman, Valentina Tereshkova, into space. It's about time. Read more about China's historic launch . Chinese women have been on a winning streak in various fields lately. Feng Shanshan, 22, on Sunday became the first golfer from China to win a major tournament by topping the Wegmans LPGA tournament in New York. The Guangzhou resident, who began playing golf at the age of 10, took home the $375,000 prize. Last year, Li Na became the first Asian-born tennis player to will a Grand Slam singles title by taking the French Open. Before long, she signed several million-dollar endorsement contracts for brands such as Rolex and Haagen-Dazs. They are following the footsteps of other sports stars, like Guo Jingjing, whose six Olympic medals, including four golds, have made her the most decorated female Olympic diver. Guo has smartly turned her good looks and diving prowess into fame and fortune. By the time she retired last year, she had collected commercial endorsements for McDonalds and other consumer brands worth millions of dollars. Marketing experts are tapping into the potential goldmine of female Chinese consumers. ""More than two-thirds (67%) of women in China are employed, compared to 58% in the U.S.,"" writes Pully Chau, chairman and CEO for Draftfcb Greater China, a marketing and communications company. ""With greater economic power, Chinese women will also have greater spending power."" ""Chinese women have grand ambitions for their future, are rapidly climbing the corporate ladder and achieving equality in compensation,"" Chau continued. Although Chinese women still face pressure to be traditional -- get married, have a child, appear meek and submissive, etc -- breaking the stereotype is no longer taboo. Many have risen from obscurity, pursued educations, started businesses, had divorces and become self-made multi-millionaires. According to Hurun Report's annual rich list, half of the top 20 richest self-made women are Chinese. Among them is Wu Yajun, chairwoman and founder of Longfor Properties. She is China's richest woman, with personal net worth of 42 billion yuan ($6.57 billion). Fortune China's 2012 ""40 under 40"" list of young entrepreneurs includes two Chinese businesswomen: Chen Chunhong, managing director of Yiyuan Environmental Group, ranks 12th, and Carol Chyau, founder and CEO of Shokay International, ranks 21st. Meng Xiaosi, vice president of the All-China Women's Federation, said that China has over 29 million female entrepreneurs, or a quarter of the nation's total. Over 41% of them are self-employed and private business owners, she said. This is a reversal of fortune, considering China's historical context. For centuries, Confucian thinking had relegated women in China to secondary and subordinate roles. ""At the early age of seven, according to the ancient practice, boys and girls did not occupy the same mat nor eat together,"" wrote J. Dyer Ball in ""Things Chinese,"" a book first published in 1925. ""Woman is made to serve in China, and the bondage is often a long and bitter one: a life of servitude to her parents; a life of submission to her parents-in-law at marriage; and the looking forward to a life of bondage to her husband in the next world, for she belongs to the same husband there, and is not allowed to be properly married to another after his death."" Foot binding, although considered something of a beauty ritual, was perhaps the most shocking practice that condemned women to being powerless homemakers. After the communist takeover in 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong banned feudal marriage and advocated gender equality. In 1950, he announced a new marriage law, banning forced marriages, domestic abuse and concubinage. The law also gave women the right to divorce. ""Women hold up half the sky,"" Mao declared famously. Women were also given access to an education and military training. ""Times have changed, and today men and women are equal,"" Mao said in another occasion. ""Whatever men comrades can accomplish, women comrades can too."" At the height of the decade-long Cultural Revolution, the Maoist idea of gender equality was taken to the extreme. Men and women then dressed the same, wearing mostly baggy and monochromatic clothing. Pro-women advocacy failed to entirely subvert China's male-centered society. Boys were still valued for their role in carrying on the family name. When China's one-child policy was introduced in 1978, it created unintended consequences, like forced abortion and gender imbalance. While women have been powerful players in China's booming economy, they are still grossly underrepresented in politics. Today only one woman, Liu Yandong, sits as a full member of the ruling Politburo of the Communist Party. Five women in all have served in the powerful policy-making body. Only four out of the 35 members of the State Council, China's government cabinet, are women. Although the constitution says that ""women enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres of life,"" domestic violence, forced abortions and sterilizations, infanticides and sex trafficking remain intractable problems for females.

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey police officer plead not guilty on Friday, a day after he was arrested and charged with setting fire to the house of an Edison police captain and his family. Michael A. Dotro was arrested on Thursday at his home in Manalapan, New Jersey, after an investigation by the Middlesex County prosecutor's office and the Monroe Township Police Department. That investigation determined that a fire at the police captain's home early on May 20 had been intentionally started outside the house. Police, EMT personnel and firefighters were called to the two-story, colonial-style home of police Capt. Mark Anderko shortly before 4 a.m. on May 20. Anderko was in the house with his wife, two children and 92-year old mother. The fire was extinguished within 10 to 15 minutes and there were no injuries, but the house was damaged. ""The investigators described it as considerable, one part of the house had damage on the first and second floor of the home, "" said Jim O'Neil, spokesman for the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office. Dotro, 35, was charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of aggravated arson, authorities said. A nine-year veteran of the Edison police department, he was suspended from his job with pay. Dotro's lawyer, Lawrence Bitterman, said that his client is ""in shock"" and had told Bitterman that ""he can't believe he's being arrested."" Superior Court Judge Bradley Ferencz on Friday upheld previously set bail conditions on Friday, which included a $5 million bail. If the bail is posted, Dotro must surrender his firearms and passport and may not have any contact with the victims. ""I believe they have the wrong guy,"" said Bitterman. Bitterman said that Dotro also told him, ""The thought of anyone doing this to his brother officer makes me (Dotro) sick."" Citing court restrictions, the prosecutor's office declined to give details of the evidence or to talk about the motive. The investigation is still ongoing but Bitterman said the search warrant didn't return any incriminating evidence.","Police officer Michael Dotro is charged with arson, attempted murder .

"(CNN) -- The people in Rwanda do not want the world to forget what happened there 18 years ago. They certainly haven't. This week, Rwandans mark the 18th anniversary of the April 6, 1994, genocide that took place in their country. For many, this is a somber but very necessary exercise, and many will visit sites where their families and friends were killed. But on a recent visit there, I took away that although people want to remember what happened, they also want to show the world how they have moved on. It was 14 years ago when I last visited Rwanda. I was covering President Bill Clinton as a White House correspondent when Air Force One touched down March 26, 1998. I remember thinking how absolutely beautiful and lush the countryside was flying in. It was hard to believe this was the same place where such atrocities occurred. We stayed on the tarmac for three hours because the Secret Service deemed it was too dangerous for the president to leave the airport. During our short stay in 1998, Clinton apologized on behalf of the American people to the Rwandans for not doing enough to stop the 1994 genocide. During that period, Rwanda's Hutu majority targeted and slaughtered the Tutsi minority and Hutu moderates, killing 800,000 people in 100 days. After his speech was over, I interviewed a genocide survivor. She was a young woman who had been gang raped and carried scars across her head from a huge machete. We sat across from each other in metal folding chairs in the airport hanger. I asked her the only thing that was on my mind: ""What gives you the strength to go on?"" And she responded ""faith."" Fourteen years later to the day, I would be invited to participate in a service project that would bring me back to Rwanda. Last week, I traveled with a small group of female journalists. We were asked to help teach young Rwandan women how to tell their own stories through journalism. They call it ""the girl effect"" -- investing in young women early in their lives so that it will pay off later in curbing poverty, disease and despair. In Rwanda, the concept is ""ni nyampinga."" In their local language, it means striving to be a beautiful woman inside and out. One of those women I met was 23-year-old Didacienne ""Dida"" Nibagwire. She is a young actress who has been in a number of films and TV shows in Rwanda. Kids go crazy seeing her on the street because they recognize her from a series she did on children's rights. As in the U.S., making a living as an actor is tough, so she does electronics repair and translations on the side. Like many Rwandans, she speaks at least three languages -- Kinyarwanda, English and French. Dida is part of the new generation of Rwandans that has hope and the opportunities to pursue their dreams. When I first met her, she smiled easily and exuded a kind of calm that felt maternal. But Dida's path to this point has been difficult, and she was very open about her struggle. When Dida was 7, her parents and six of her 10 siblings were killed in the genocide. Her earliest memory is of running -- running with her sister, her mother and many others for reasons she says she didn't understand. Dida says she remembers first her father being shot, then her mother attacked. ""They put a spear in her back. ... Then they shot my younger sister and cut the leg off one of my other sisters. Then after that, that's when they killed my mom, but she did not die. She was talking to my sister, asking for water, but she could not go out to search for water. Then she died,"" Dida says. Dida and her older sister, Claire, survived after the killers launched a grenade. ""She was sleeping in front of me, and her blood was all over over me, and they thought we were both dead. That night she took me to walk,"" Dida says. Days later on the dangerous journey, Dida and Claire were apprehended by a group and thrown into a pit of dead bodies. ""A certain day many killers came and the leaders took me and my sister and then they opened a big hole and threw us in. I was asking please forgive us."" Dida says she asked Claire whether they were actually dead. The two survived because a friend of Dida's sister paid someone to pull them out. ""Someone came and opened up and removed my sister and tried to remove me but because there were many dead they said, 'We leave her here.' "" Dida's sister saved her life when she offered to take her place. But they could not save everyone. ""The sad thing is that they closed the pit, and they left the other man inside, and he was still alive,"" Dida says. This is just a small part of Dida's complicated story. When I asked her how she endured such tragedy and is able to cope today, she says, ""I think it's an obligation. I have to do something good for my country. ... I ask myself why did I stay, why not my younger sister, why not my brother, and I say maybe God has something that he wants me to do."" Dida is doing plenty these days, including theater, teaching and voice-over work. She is most proud of her performances that draw attention to the problem of violence against girls and says it contributes to her healing. ""There is no paradise on Earth. What happened in Rwanda can happen anywhere,"" Dida says. But Dida also is somewhat of an ambassador for her country. ""Rwanda is not only about genocide. I think Rwanda is about something else,"" she says. ""I think many people when they hear Rwanda they link it with genocide, but after 18 years, Rwanda is at a certain point. ... We have our culture, we have our history, we have many things. ""We have a developing country. It's a tourist country. ... It is our history but we also want people to know that Rwanda is not all about genocide; Rwanda is something else.""","On April 6, 1994, a genocide began in Rwanda that claimed 800,000 lives .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The heady days of James Bond are but a distant memory and, the sad fact is amphibious cars are just not that cool anymore. On land, on water, under the water: The Rinspeed sQuba will go anywhere you want and it is entirely emissions-free. But a new fully submersible car inspired by Bond and updated for the new millennium could breathe fresh life into the sub-aqua sports car. The Rinspeed sQuba is a fully submersible car designed by Swiss car designer Frank M Rinderknecht. Inspired by James Bond's submersible Lotus Esprit in the 1977 movie ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" the car drives on land, on water -- and under the water to a depth of ten meters. Released as a prototype last year, the car is carbon neutral, entirely emissions-free and boasts electric motors and water jets to allow the driver to control the vehicle under the water. See photos of the sQuba » . The sQuba also has a compressed air tank which allows the occupants to breathe under water and all of the body work is water-tight and water-resistant. Rinderknecht, the chief executive of Rinspeed, told CNN that no further units of the car have been produced -- but commercial production was not out of the question. ""Since the sQuba was perceived as a prototype, the manufacturing has not been explored. However, we are open for anyone to take up the project to serial production,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- An injury-time penalty from Keisuke Honda fired Japan into the 2014 FIFA World Cup, making the Samurai Blue the first country to qualify for next year's tournament in Brazil. With Japan needing to avoid defeat in order to clinch one of the 32 places with a game to spare, playmaker Honda converted a late spot-kick to level the score at 1-1 after Australia had taken a surprise lead through Tommy Oar's speculative cross with eight minutes remaining. Tuesday's point means Alberto Zaccheroni's Japan are seven points clear at the top of Asian qualifying's Group B and assured of a place in a fifth consecutive World Cup.

The Omanis' nine points are now two better than both Australia and Jordan, but the latter pair have a match in hand. This will be played when the Socceroos, who have qualified for the last two World Cups, host Jordan in Melbourne next Tuesday. The result of that match will determine what each team needs to do in their final qualifier on June 18, when Group B concludes with Australia at home again, against Iraq, while Oman travel to Jordan.

"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (CNN) -- Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, will host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee announced Friday. Confetti flies in Rio de Janeiro after the IOC announces the city will host the 2016 games. The announcement brought tears to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who dabbed his eyes with a handkerchief several times in a news conference afterward. ""Our hour has arrived,"" he said. ""It has arrived."" In Rio, jubilation erupted at the world-famous Copacabana beach, where thousands of people gathered to hear the announcement. Rio organizers promised to start working immediately to make the games a success. ""Maybe some of the people tomorrow can rest,"" said Rio 2016 President Carlos Nuzman. ""I'm not [resting]."" Rio beat Madrid, Spain, in the final round. Chicago, Illinois, and Tokyo, Japan, were eliminated in earlier rounds. For Rio, a major appeal was bringing the Olympics to South America for the first time. IOC President Jacques Rogge said in the news conference afterward that in addition to its excellent bid, Rio had the ""extra added value of going for the first time to a continent that's never had the games."" He also noted that Brazil helped its chances this year when it did not get the 2012 games awarded four years ago. ""Rio remained humble,"" he said. ""They wanted to listen, to repair their shortcomings."" More than half of Rio's Olympic venues are built, including state-of-the-art facilities constructed for the 2007 Pan and Parapan American Games: the magnificent Joao Havelange Stadium (the proposed 2016 venue for athletics), the Maria Lenk Aquatic Center, the Rio Olympic Arena (which will host gymnastics and wheelchair basketball), the Rio Olympic Velodrome, the National Equestrian Center and its close neighbor, the National Shooting Center. Rio will hold the games from August 5-21 and its theme will be ""Live your passion.""  Watch Brazil delegation celebrate as Rio is announced winner » . According to Rio's bid, the games will be held in four zones with varying socioeconomic characteristics: . • Barra, the heart of the games, is an expanding area of Rio that will require ""considerable infrastructure and accommodation development."" It will house the Olympic and media villages and some venues. • Copacabana, a world-famous beach and major tourist attraction, will host outdoor sports in temporary venues. • Maracana, the most densely populated of the zones, will contain an athletic stadium and the Maracana Stadium, which will host the opening and closing ceremonies. Major redevelopment is planned for the zone. • Deodoro has little infrastructure, but the highest proportion of young people. It will require construction of Olympic venues. The city's bid was helped by a strong economy and guaranteed funding. Brazil's economy is the 10th largest in the world and predicted to be fifth by 2016. Brazil told the IOC its commitment to the Olympics could be seen in the  investment already under way in Rio. Maracana Stadium will close next year for two years of refurbishment. The areas around it will be renovated, with improved access and transportation links. The entire neighborhood will be reborn, the Rio committee said, to host the final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Work is already under way on the ongoing development of the Olympic Training Center, which includes many of the state-of-the-art venues built for the 2007 Pan and Parapan American Games. This was Madrid's third attempt at hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Summer Games. Madrid presented a ""very capable"" bid, with good transportation infrastructure and a number of venues already in place, said Ed Hula, editor of the Olympics Web site Around the Rings.  Watch Madrid celebrate making it to final round » . Madrid's chances might have been hampered, however, by a recent tradition that consecutive Summer Olympics aren't staged on the same continent. The London, England, 2012 Olympics will have happened just four years before 2016. ""Although there's no rule against it, the IOC has yet to award consecutive summer games to the same continent since 1952 in Helsinki,"" Hula said. Chicago was the first city to be eliminated. The announcement -- unexpected by many -- came just hours after President Obama and his wife, Michelle, delivered personal pleas to the Olympic committee praising the virtues of their home city.  Watch Obama makes his pitch to IOC » . ""You can play a great game and still not win,"" Obama said after returning to the White House. ""Although I wish we had come back with better news ... I could not be prouder of my hometown."" Obama said he believed Chicago had made ""the strongest bid possible."" ""I'm totally stunned. I thought we had a great opportunity,"" said former NBA great Michael Jordan. Jordan, who led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles, said the city would have been ""perfect for the world to explore."" He said Chicago is ""deserving of an event of that magnitude"" and hopes it will try again. U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, a Chicago Democrat, said the loss is ""kind of heartbreaking. ... A tremendous amount of effort has been put into trying to win the bid."" The response around the city was not all negative, however. Many residents are ""almost glad the distraction of the Olympics"" won't be there, noted CNN's Ali Velshi, who was in downtown Chicago when the news was announced. Many residents feel it will allow local political and business leaders to ""focus attention back on what Chicago needs to do,"" Velshi said. Obama, the first U.S. president to make an Olympic bid in person, was flying back to Washington when the announcement was made. He was disappointed with the outcome but not sorry he made the trip to Copenhagen, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said. The heads of state for the other three finalists also made personal pitches. Spain's King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia and Spanish President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero pushed the case for Madrid. Recently elected Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama made a bid for Tokyo. Brazilian President Lula da Silva was joined by soccer legend and Brazilian native Pelé as they advertised the benefits of a Rio games. An animated Lula da Silva, surrounded by Rio supporters, said at a news conference after the announcement, ""Among the 10 major economies of the world, Brazil was the only country that had not received the Olympic and Paralympic Games. For us, it will hardly be our last Olympics. For us, it will be an opportunity to be equal. It will increase self-esteem for Brazilians, will consolidate recent conquests and stimulate new advances.""","International Olympic Committee names Rio de Janeiro as host of 2016 games .

"(CNN) -- An ice floe forced oil giant Royal Dutch Shell to call off its preparatory drilling off Alaska just a day after the controversial work started, the company announced Monday. The drifting chunk of ice, more than 32 miles long by 12 miles wide, forced the drill ship Noble Discoverer to move off the planned well as a precaution, company spokesman Curtis Smith said. But the ship will be re-anchored within the next few days, and drilling will resume, Smith said. Shell began work on its planned well in the Chukchi Sea, about 90 miles off the Alaskan North Slope, on Sunday. The Interior Department granted the company permission to begin ""certain limited preparatory activities"" -- including work related to the installation of a blowout preventer -- on August 30. Shell's plans had been held up by BP's disastrous 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which prompted a review of offshore drilling plans. Environmental groups argued against the project, warning that a spill would be difficult to plug and clean up in the remote and inhospitable Arctic. Shell says it's working at far less depth and lower pressures than the BP well that erupted off Louisiana, destroying the Deepwater Horizon drill rig and killing 11 men aboard. But Steve Oomittuk, the mayor of the Alaskan coastal town of Point Hope, said he's keeping a wary eye on the Shell operation and has concerns about what the future will bring. ""There's nothing we can do now but I worry about the weather and the animals we depend on for our survival,"" he said. If ""Shell finds what it thinks is down there then many other companies are going to come and then it will only be a matter of time before something happens out there."" The U.S. Geological Survey estimates more than 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas may be recoverable. The shrinking of the region's sea ice -- which hit record lows this year -- has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region. The amount of the Arctic covered by sea ice fell in late August to the lowest point since satellite observations began in 1979, the National Snow and Ice Data Center reported. That trend has stretched into September, with 45% less coverage than September conditions in the 1980s and 1990s. Climate researchers say this decrease in sea ice a symptom of a warming climate, caused largely by the combustion of carbon-rich fossil fuels. The science is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most scientists. CNN's Miguel Marquez contributed to this report.","Shell began work on its controversial Arctic project Sunday .

"Hailey, Idaho (CNN) -- The father of the only American POW in Afghanistan sent a message to his son's Taliban captors on Saturday: ""After 12 years, let there be peace. Can we push this forward and make it happen?"" And he sent a message to his son: ""I will not leave you on the battlefield. You are not forgotten."" Updates about Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's case have been sparse since he was captured nearly four years ago after finishing a guard shift at a combat outpost. Family members have remained reticent for fear of jeopardizing his safety. But the 27-year-old soldier's parents spoke out at a rally in home state of Idaho on Saturday, just days after U.S. authorities said discussion of a possible prisoner exchange with the Taliban could be on the table during upcoming talks. ""We are feeling optimistic this week,"" mother Jani Bergdahl said. ""So many of you have come from far away, and we appreciate the sacrifices you made to make this possible."" More than 1,000 people were in the crowd, including hundreds of war veterans who rode motorcycles into this town. Throughout the event, they chanted, ""Bring Bowe Home."" Local politicians, state senators and police officials also spoke at the event. ""We hope he will see this and know of you,"" his mother told the crowd. Then, she sent a message to her son, ""We love you and are eagerly awaiting your return home."" In a statement released earlier this week through a family spokesman, the soldier's parents said they were encouraged by word that upcoming negotiations might lead to their son's freedom. ""That is encouraging news, especially after not much encouraging news over the past four years,"" Army Col. Tim Marsano said, adding that the Bergdahls have been talking with military and government agencies. ""They know their son has not been forgotten. My brothers and sisters in uniform know we won't rest until Bowe Bergdahl is safely back with his family."" At Saturday's rally, father Bob Bergdahl sported a long beard, which he has grown out since his son's capture as a sign of solidarity. And he spoke briefly in Pashto, a language that he's studied during his son's captivity. He offered a message that he said was meant for the Taliban. ""May the peace of God and blessings of God be upon you,"" he said. ""After 12 years, let there be peace. Can we push this forward and make this happen?"" Speaking in English, he offered a message in English that he said was meant for his son. ""Bowe, my son, if you can hear me. ... you are part of the peace process, you are part of ending the Afghan war. Have faith. Do good works. Tell the truth, and have the patience that can only come from God. We are being tested,"" Bob Bergdahl said. On Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said the U.S. expects prisoner exchange to be a topic of talks with the Taliban, which are slated to take place ""in the coming days,"" in Doha, Qatar. No decisions have been made about transferring any Taliban detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. Any such decision would have to be made with congressional approval and in accordance with U.S. law, she said. It won't be the first time U.S. negotiators raise the issue of Bergdahl's release with the Taliban. The two sides held meetings in 2011 and 2012 that included the topic of Bergdahl's release, with sporadic discussions since then. While the United States has been pushing for the return of Bergdahl -- captured in June 2009 in Afghanistan -- the Taliban has been pushing for the release of five of its own men from U.S. custody in Guantanamo Bay. Psaki said the United States expects the Taliban will raise that issue again when the two sides meet. In the meantime, Bergdahl's father said Saturday that he'll never stop pushing for his son's freedom. ""A father does not leave his son on the battlefield. I live in Afghanistan, my phone on Afghan time,"" he said. ""I will not leave you on the battlefield. You are not forgotten. You will not be forgotten. We pray soon you will come home."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","Dad's words to POW son: ""I will not leave you on the battlefield. You are not forgotten""

"(CNN) -- This week on The Big Three, we tackled the George W. Bush library opening, frustration over flight furloughs (complete with congressional finger-pointing) and Dean Obeidallah's CNN.com column, ""I'm a Muslim and I hate terrorism,"" which seems sadly necessary in the wake of Boston. The opening of a presidential library is supposed to be a time for national unity. All the living presidents attend, standing together for a photo op and offering complimentary speeches about the newest inductee to the ex-presidents' club. But during all the same pageantry in Dallas at the opening of Bush's library, a less civil debate on the Big Three (and across the country) was going on about 43's legacy. Margaret Hoover is a proud Bush administration alumna and attended the opening in Dallas. Dean, it is fair to say, is not a Bush fan. At all. And so the debate raged, with Margaret citing his investment in foreign aid to stem the tide of AIDS in Africa and keeping the nation safe from terrorism after the attacks of 9/11. Dean acknowledged that Bush might be a nice guy to hang out with but asked whether the library would consist primarily of coloring books. As the card-carrying centrist in the group, I try to find common ground. And so it goes. At the time of our discussions, the sequester cuts were kicking in, and airline travelers were feeling the pain, with 40% of flights delayed this week because of the furlough of air-traffic controllers. Congress has since overwhelmingly approved a measure to get the air travel system up to speed again after the delays provoked a round of the blame game on Capitol Hill, with conservatives accusing the president of ""playing politics"" with these particular cuts. Margaret agreed with this assessment. I ain't buying it. The sequester was supposed to be so dumb and painful that it would compel Congress to reason together and find deficit and debt reduction to more strategic means. It didn't. And while the rhetoric of cutting government spending is popular, the reality is predictably less so. And so we're being treated to the absurdity of conservative activist groups such as Americans for Prosperity -- whose sole purpose is to argue for cuts in government spending -- complaining about the practical effects of those very cuts on which they insisted. This is the old dynamic we see too much of -- cuts for thee but not for me. Finally, in the wake of the Boston terror attacks, America and the American Muslim community have navigated the tricky territory of confronting the ideology of radical Islam that apparently inspired the attacks without engaging in group blame. Dean's excellent CNN.com column tries to clarify some of the bigoted myths by making the point that American Muslims might hate jihadis even more than typical Americans do because the murderers claim to represent their faith and cause a massive backlash against this growing American community. Read the column -- and then listen to our conversation, tackling subjects such as why extremists of other faiths tend not to blow things up.","CNN Radio podcast features CNN Opinion contributors on top three stories .

"Singapore (CNN) -- Singapore breathed a sigh of relief Sunday as changing wind patterns created a pocket of clearer skies from a haze of choking fumes. Pollution levels measured by the Singaporean government dipped sharply after all-time record levels hit Friday. The fumes were blamed on plantation fires in neighboring Indonesia. Small pockets of people ventured back out to the streets in neighborhoods such as Ang Mo Kio, but many donned filter masks to help with the foul-smelling haze. Masks quickly sold out at stores when the pollution hit last week. But by Sunday, officials handed out emergency supplies of free masks at community centers. Although haze levels have receded, officials warned that the smoke could make a strong comeback in the coming days, and may linger for months. That could have serious health implications, said Philip Eng, a professor of respiratory medicine at Mt. Elizabeth Medical Centre. ""In my patients, I have seen an increase (in consultations) by about 30% or so,"" he said, particularly among older people with chronic conditions. ""But we are still in early days,"" he said. ""If this thing drags on for a month, I won't be surprised if more people get hospitalized."" Many usually crowded cafes along the waterfront sat empty Saturday, with too few customers to stay open. But a scattering of tourists braved the haze to take photos at the city's iconic Merlion fountain. The smell of the burning peat and wood was distinct. ""We're used to fog, but this was a real 'pea souper',"" Briton expatriate Tom Fairburn said. ""It smells like a pile of burning tires next to a bonfire, not pleasant."" It's hard to predict the final economic impact of the haze on Singapore's economy. One Asia-Pacific brokerage firm put the potential toll in the hundreds of millions. CLSA said that the economy had taken a $300 million-hit in lost tourist income, closed offices and construction downtime in 1997 -- the previous all-time high in pollution. The current situation could be far more costly, it said. Transport officials warned ships to be extra vigilant in the teeming straits between Singapore and Sumatra because the haze made it difficult to see other boats. It is easy to see the neighboring island from the beaches in Singapore. But the view was not as clear in the past few days, with ships peeking in and out of the thick haze Saturday. Local shop owners felt the crunch. In one beach side shop, the owner looked forlornly into the horizon as bikes that would normally be rented out stood in stacks.","Pollution levels dip sharply in Singapore .

"(CNN) -- Pop-cultural suburbia: Take your pick. Happy children. Low taxes. Smooth roads. Picture windows. Quiet streets. Shopping malls. Or: Bored teenagers. Sterile sprawl. Endless traffic. Creepy neighbors. Festering secrets. Shopping malls. For some, the promised land. For others, a worm-infested dullsville. Why such a divide? Perhaps it's the natural reaction to disillusionment, says Syracuse pop culture professor Robert Thompson. The suburb ""was touted as the perfect way to package American life in the utopian era that we expected the end of World War II to bring us,"" he says. ""We're in the Space Age. Television comes out. Air conditioning and dishwashers and all of this stuff. The suburbs stood for the place where this perfect kind of life was going to be lived."" The suburb wasn't a new concept; people had been attempting to push their way out of crowded cities for as long as there had been crowded cities, and rail service and streetcars made it possible to build communities on city outskirts. ""Streetcar suburbs,"" such as Atlanta's Inman Park, Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and Houston's Houston Heights, started sprouting in the 19th century. But it was the automobile, with its promise of personal mobility, that fostered a suburban boom. The most popular exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair was Norman Bel Geddes' Futurama -- sponsored by General Motors -- which posited a future of superhighways leading consumers through muscular cities and bucolic towns. ""I Have Seen The Future,"" read the souvenir buttons. CNN Photos: Bill Owens' 'Suburbia' captured the American Dream . The future originally looked something like the past. Tired of six-story walkups? In the suburbs you could have your own picket-fenced home, just like the ones in small towns of yore. Sick of the subway? In the suburbs you could ride the comfortable commuter train -- or, even better, travel to work on a speedy expressway in your very own car. Television was the best mirror of this optimistic age. Mayfield's Cleavers (""Leave It to Beaver""), Springfield's Andersons (""Father Knows Best,"" less biting than the radio version) and Hilldale's Stones (""The Donna Reed Show"") all lived in crime-free municipalities urban enough to have the latest appliances (like, well, a television) but removed enough that their kids could play and bike without those crowded city worries -- like traffic, ethnic groups and the poor. In this period, it was writers who poked holes in suburban perfection. John Cheever, with his quietly desperate New York escapees, was the master of suburban dissatisfaction, but others -- novelist Richard Yates (""Revolutionary Road"") and journalist Vance Packard (""The Status Seekers"") among them -- took aim at the consumerist society entwined with suburbia. On TV, only ""Twilight Zone's"" Rod Serling -- at heart, a writer -- seemed to agree with them. Eventually their views took over. If the cities were rotten -- just check out early '70s films such as ""The French Connection"" and ""Shaft"" for a taste of the chipping paint -- the suburbs were soulless, cookie-cutter places inhabited by people with secrets. Southern California, which is often depicted as one big suburb, was the center of this emptiness (it doesn't hurt that the region's chief industry is fantasy), but it's an image that transfers anywhere, from Chicago (""Ordinary People"") to Elm Street (""A Nightmare on Elm Street""). Indeed, horror movies such as ""Nightmare,"" ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Poltergeist"" found plenty to work with in the suburbs. These days, the pop culture divide still holds. To some -- Woody Allen comes to mind -- the city, for all its faults, is vibrant and lively, and the suburbs are ""American Beauty"" dead ends. To others, particularly television producers, it's the suburbs -- where most of us live, after all -- where real life happens, and the city is something for the wealthy, the terminally hip, the criminals and the tourists. iReport: What makes your suburb unique? The truth, of course, is neither here nor there. Today's suburbs are increasingly multicultural and, in some cases, have developed their own skyscraper-filled ""edge cities,"" in the term popularized by journalist Joel Garreau. Accurately portraying such a complex environment is as difficult as accurately portraying the people who live there -- though there are some (author Tom Perrotta, ""My So-Called Life"" producers Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick) who try. In the end, suburbia is what our imagination wants it to be, and it won't quite fit into those little boxes of ticky-tacky. ""We know that inside each one of those identical boxes, with its Dodge parked out front, and its white bread on the table, and its TV set glowing blue in the falling dusk, there were people with stories,"" concluded the pilot of ""The Wonder Years."" ""There were families bound together in the pain and the struggle of love. There were moments that made us cry with laughter. And there were moments ... of sorrow and wonder.""","Pop-culture depiction of suburbia is divided: Paradise or hell .
In years shortly after World War II, suburbia was presented as utopia .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The lawyer who filed a sexual battery lawsuit against John Travolta on behalf of two male massage therapists and then dismissed it is now suing another lawyer for allegedly stealing his clients. The federal lawsuit was dismissed last week after one client dropped out after confusion over the date of the alleged incident and the second plaintiff fired attorney Okorie Okorocha and hired high-profile lawyer Gloria Allred. The suit accused the actor of groping two male massage therapists at hotels in Los Angeles and Atlanta in January. Travolta's lawyer, Martin Singer, called the allegations ""ridiculous."" Allred, who now represents both men, said she is considering refiling the lawsuit against Travolta in another court. She denied that she solicited them, insisting they contacted her. Travolta sexual battery lawsuit withdrawn, but case may go on . ""She's either calling her client a liar or she's lying,"" Okorocha said Monday afternoon. Okorocha filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior court Monday contending that Allred illegally and unethically solicited the second client -- identified as John Doe #2. ""The solicitations included asking John Doe No. 2 'Are you happy with your representation?'"" the suit said. An exhibit attached to his complaint is a screenshot of a cell phone text message exchange he said was with John Doe #2 two days before the client fired him and hired Allred. ""Do you have the number Gloria Allred called from?"" the image showed Okorocha asking his client. ""I will check my caller ID. It was on my home phone,"" the client replied, according to the exhibit. ""She ain't been in a courtroom in 20 years. Just doing stupid ass press conference side shows,"" Okorocha, a lawyer who specializes in drunk driving trials, wrote in reply. Two days before he was fired by John Doe #2, Okorocha told CNN that he believed Allred was trying to steal his client. She denied the charge that day, . ""That is completely false,"" Allred responded to a CNN request for comment that day. ""I have never done that and do not have any idea who John Doe 2 is."" Okorocha received a call two days later from that client telling him he was fired and that Allred was his new lawyer, Okorocha said. ""We believe that the lawsuit should be filed in another court and, therefore, the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice,"" Allred said last Thursday. ""We will be conferring with our client regarding what will happen next in this case."" Okorocha's suit accuses Allred of intentional interference with contractual relations, intentional interference with prospective economic relations and unfair business practices. ""I get the case to national prominence and then someone who only does press conferences and sideshows, and doesn't actually go to court or do trials, just steps in and says, 'I'll take the clients,'"" Okorocha said in a CNN interview. Allred called Okorocha's allegations ""false, outrageous and defamatory"" and demanded a retraction. She told CNN Monday that she would file a defamation suit against Okorocha if he sued her. ""Because both John Doe #1 and John Doe #2 contacted us,"" she said. ""As have all of our thousands of clients in the 27 years that I have been practicing law. And we have great confidence that we will obtain a judgment against him for defamation.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Five people got the lavish ride of a lifetime as the only passengers on a transatlantic flight, causing environmental groups to criticize the major carrier for leaving a wasteful carbon footprint. American Airlines has faced criticism for a transatlantic flight carrying only five passengers. Using about 68,000 liters (15,000 imperial gallons) -- or 13,000 liters per passenger -- of jet fuel for the nine-hour trip from Chicago to London, American Airlines is being accused of unnecessary waste. Each passenger left a footprint of 35.77 tons of carbon dioxide, enough to drive an average car 160,000 kilometers (100,000 miles). ""Flying virtually empty planes is an obscene waste of fuel. Through no fault of their own, each passenger's carbon footprint for this flight is about 45 times what it would have been if the plane had been full,"" Friends of the Earth's transport campaigner Richard Dyer said. Because of a mechanical malfunction, AA flight 90 was 14 hours late leaving Chicago's O'Hare airport on February 8. Though most passengers made other arrangements to London, five lucky passengers unable to be rebooked made the 6,400 kilometer (4,000 mile) flight in business class, with two crew members per passenger. American Airlines said it chose to continue with the flight because of the full load of passengers waiting at London's Heathrow airport to return to the United States. ""With such a small passenger load we did consider whether we could cancel the flight and re-accommodate the five remaining passengers on other flights,"" says American Airlines' European spokesperson Anneliese Morris. ""However, this would have left a plane load of west-bound passengers stranded in London Heathrow who were due to fly to the U.S. on the same aircraft."" Morris was quick to point out that despite the staggeringly low passenger count, the flight did carry a full cargo load. ""We sought alternative flights for the west-bound passengers but heavy loads out of London meant that this was not possible. The only option was to operate the flight,"" Morris said. ""This put the aircraft in London Heathrow for the following day, enabling us to operate a full schedule and avoid further inconvenience to our passengers and cargo customers."" Environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth say that international governments should hold the aviation industry accountable for the amount of CO2 they produce each year, and point to instances like this to show that airlines should pay a fuel tax to rein them in. ""Governments must stop granting the aviation industry the unfair privileges that allow this to happen by taxing aviation fuel and including emissions from aviation in international agreements to tackle climate change,"" Dyer said. But despite these accusations, Kieran Daly, air transport intelligence editor for Flight International magazine, said the amount passengers carried was irrelevant. ""Airlines are still a business. The cargo had to be flown and perhaps some of it was time-sensitive,"" Daly said. ""It's just not practical for an airline to tell its customers that it won't fly until it has a full passenger load. Customers won't be happy and the airline will quickly be out of business."" E-mail to a friend .","Environmental groups angry with American Airlines after five-passenger flight .

"(CNN) -- Virginia Tech has accepted a committee's recommendation not to build an indoor sports-training facility in the area known as the stadium woods -- a densely wooded area behind the Blacksburg football stadium. Earlier this year, environmentalists became enraged when they were informed of the university's plan to build a state-of-the-art practice facility in the old-growth forest, where some of the trees are 150 to more than 300 years old. The blueprint had called for at least 60 trees to be cut down for the facility. Virginia Tech Forestry professor John Seiler explained the significance of the old-growth trees to CNN while tracing a tree sample in his office earlier this summer. ""That's the walk on the moon, World War II, World War I. Here's Virginia Tech, founded shortly after the Civil War,"" he said, pointing to the rings on a strip of trunk from one of the 11-acre woods' elderly residents. Read more about the tree-boring process . Seiler and others quickly formed the organization, Friends of Stadium Woods, and an online petition was launched to sway the university and athletic department. The petition was signed by more than 10,000 people nationwide. Virginia Tech President Charles W. Steger got wind of the controversy and appointed a 15-person committee in January to make a recommendation on whether the facility should be built at the stadium woods location or somewhere else. The committee deliberated for months, surveying students, faculty and staff. They received more than 500 e-mails from the public with varying opinions. In early June, the committee handed their recommendations to the school's Board of Visitors. Committee Chair John Randolph said it was ""in the university's best interest"" to build the facility at a different location. The determining factor ended up being the ""social importance"" of the stadium woods, Randolph said. In the end, Sherwood Wilson, Virginia Tech's vice president of administrative services, recommended to Steger that the university accept the committee's recommendation. Wilson further directed his staff to ""evaluate other potential sites."" Steger accepted Wilson's recommendation and, according to university spokesman Larry Hincker, they are now ""going back to the drawing board."" Friends of Stadium Woods released a statement saying they were ""pleased"" the university had accepted the committee's recommendation. However, the statement said, the group had hoped the university would preserve the woods with a conservation easement, which would permanently prevent any development on the land. According to a university statement, the school doesn't plan to ""place the woods in a conservation easement or give a special designation to the property."" Hincker said it would not be in the best interest for the university's ""long-range planning"" because it would ""tie future generations to something that (university officials) really haven't had an opportunity to analyze."" The office of university architect will now be tasked with finding another location for the sports-training facility. In the meantime, the university will continue to raise money to fund the project.","After petition, Virginia Tech to seek alternative location for state-of-art sports facility .

"(CNN) -- For more than a year, rights groups have criticized Bahrain for its crackdown on anti-government protests. The protests, which began in February 2011, were spurred by the popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt but have failed to gain the traction of the other Arab Spring uprisings. Lamees Dhaif, a journalist and activist, shares her thoughts on what is happening in her home country and its future in this conversation, edited for length and clarity. CNN: What do you think about what happened to Ali Hasan, the 11-year-old boy who was arrested in May for participating in an ""illegal gathering"" and released months later from jail? Dhaif: I think what happened to Ali Hasan is very tragic. Keeping a minor behind bars for a month is unexplainable. No judiciary system in the world keeps infants jailed for this long without a trial. ... I think that children are being detained frequently now in order to silence protesters. The regime wants to warn protesters that it can do whatever it wants to anyone regardless of his/her age or type of activity the person performs at the time of arrest. ... Ali is not the first minor nor the last. There are still others in jail. CNN: How is this story illustrative of what is happening in Bahrain? Where do you see the situation in Bahrain going? Dhaif: The situation in Bahrain is unpredictable and chaotic just like all the arbitrary arrests and fabricated charges. The judiciary system is not independent. The charges are a reflection of what the regime wants to take place on the ground. The charges are politically biased, and in most cases, no solid evidence is present. ... The situation is becoming more and more complicated especially now that activists and human rights defenders who were not arrested earlier are targeted now by the regime. An example is Nabeel Rajab, who is detained for bogus charges. The regime is escalating its revenge from its people amidst the silence of the international community. CNN: Considering the world's attention on Syria and Egypt as well as other Arab nations that have experienced uprisings, do you think that the world has forgotten about Bahrain? Dhaif: Bahrain is forgotten now, and it was forgotten when the Arab Spring started, because what is happening in Bahrain is not the result of the regime's rule only. It is the result of the joint collaboration, interests and political unity of more than one country. Bahrain's allies (Great Britain and the United States) do not want to interfere in what is taking place because Bahrain has been a good ally for them in the region. The Gulf Cooperation Council countries (which besides Bahrain include Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) also cannot allow Bahrain to have more democracy and freedom because it will pressure other countries to do the same, and they do not want that. So, basically Bahrain has not been forgotten ... but, in fact, it had been deliberately wiped out from the media coverage for political reasons. CNN: What is next for Bahrain? What steps can be taken to reach a resolution? Dhaif: The resolution cannot take place unless it comes from the allied countries. The international community can place an embargo on Bahrain to force it to become more democratic and undergo reforms. Bahrain's economy cannot stand on its own. It is highly dependent on imports. If it is threatened in this way, it cannot go on. Therefore, the international community has to hold its arms sales at least to Bahrain since that is what the regime uses to kill its people. A resolution will take place if the allies agree to give the regime in Bahrain the right to undergo reforms.","Bahrain has been criticized by its crackdown on protesters .

"MONTGOMERY, Alabama (CNN)  -- From the time he first emerged as a civil rights leader, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. lived with the threat of death, but he never wavered in his commitment to non-violence. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. believed the cause they were fighting for was worth dying for. ""Dr. King made it rather clear that the cause that we were fighting for was not only worth living for, but it was worth dying for, if need be,"" said Fred Gray, the lawyer who helped King lead the fight to desegregate city buses in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1956. A month after blacks began a bus boycott, a midnight caller warned King that he would be sorry he ever came to Montgomery. Three days later, his house was bombed. Angry blacks gathered outside King's home, but Gray said, ""Once he found out his family was safe and secure, he simply went out, talked to the crowd, and told them to go home, and they went."" King knew what could happen when he led demonstrations in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963, facing fire hoses and police dogs in an effort to desegregate downtown businesses. Longtime aide Andrew Young said, ""Going to Birmingham was to him the possibility of an imminent death."" Another aide, the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, said when he kissed his own wife and children goodbye to go there, ""I thought I would never see them again. I didn't think I would come out of Birmingham alive. I didn't think King would."" But in September, after the city had yielded, it would be four young girls who would be killed in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church. King felt responsible, Young said. ""Most of those days he was in a deep depression."" When King delivered the eulogy for the victims, lawyer Clarence Jones said, ""It was one of the few vivid times ... where I observed tears, him crying as he was speaking."" Yet King told the mourners, ""In spite of the darkness of this hour ... we must not become bitter, nor must we harbor the desire to retaliate with violence."" King flew into Memphis, Tennessee, the first week of April 1968 to try to lead a peaceful march in support of a strike by black garbage workers. On a stormy night, he spoke at a church rally. ""He talked about death more than I heard him talk about it at any one given,"" Memphis NAACP leader Rev. Billy Kyles said. King told the crowded church, ""I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now. Because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind."" Young said the speech was one that King had made before when times were dangerous. ""Because he had done it before, and we'd gone on to the next place, I wasn't really taking it seriously,"" Young said. ""It was just a great speech, but I never thought I was listening to his last speech."" King ended: ""I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord."" ""We were just boo-hooing. And we had to actually help him to his seat,"" Kyles said. ""He gave it his all, and somehow, I guess he knew that would be his last hurrah."" The next evening, King walked out of his motel room to have dinner at Kyles' home. ""I said, 'Guys, come on, let's go,' and I walked to the stairs,"" Kyles remembered. ""Before I could get to the stairs, the shot rang out. 'Ka-POW!' ""Blood was everywhere,"" Kyles said. ""I took a spread from one of the beds and covered him from the neck down. He never said a word.""","Lawyer: Dr. King believed the cause was worth dying for .

"(CNN) -- This year's session, with fiscal cliff negotiations and lively nomination controversies, is anything but lame. But it's still a lame-duck Congress. Just how did a meeting of one Congress that occurs after a new one is elected but not yet sworn-in get that name? We're slow roasting the answers to those questions and serving them up by the numbers: . What is a 'lame duck'? 18th Century - The term ""lame duck"" originates in Great Britain to describe a bankrupt businessman. 1830s - The term ""lame duck"" arrives in the United States, but is used to describe politicians on their way out of office, rather than businessmen. 85 - The number of current members of Congress who are lame ducks. History . 17 weeks - The length of time between November elections and inauguration on March 4th, prior to the 20th Amendment being ratified in 1933. This led to many problems, such as President-elect Abraham Lincoln being unable to deal with the secession of seven states during the long gap between his election and inauguration. 2 - The number of times a lame duck House of Representatives chose the president and vice president in disputed elections. This occurred in 1800 and 1824. 1932 - The year that humorist Will Rogers said: ""An awful lot of people are confused as to just what is meant by a lame duck Congress. It's like where some fellows worked for you and their work wasn't satisfactory and you let 'em out, but after you fired 'em, you let 'em stay long enough so they could burn your house down."" The 20th Amendment . 1923 - Senator George Norris of Nebraska proposes the 20th Amendment, moving the start date of Congress from March 4th to January 3rd. The Senate passes it 63-6. 1932 - After nine years of delays, the House also passes Norris' amendment, 336-56. 1933 - The 20th Amendment to the Constitution is ratified. 19 - Number of lame duck sessions of Congress since the ratification of the 20th Amendment. Prior to the ratification of the 20th Amendment, every second session of Congress from the first to the 73rd was technically a lame duck session. 10 - Number of these sessions from 1940 to 1992. 9 - Number of these sessions from 1994 to 2012. There was no lame duck session in 1996. 1 day - The shortest lame duck session, which took place on December 31, 1948. 58 days - The longest lame duck session, which took place in the Senate from November 7, 1940 to January 3, 1941. Noteworthy lame duck sessions . 1954 - The year the Senate holds a lame duck session to censure Wisconsin Sen.

"(CNN) -- Hermine dumped rain on the San Antonio, Texas, area Tuesday before bringing the same, along with tornado watches and flash-flood warnings, to the central and northern parts of the state. As of 8 p.m. ET, the center of Hermine, downgraded to a tropical depression, was about five miles (about eight kilometers) southwest of Brady. Its maximum sustained winds were at 35 mph (55 kph). It was moving north at about 20 mph (33 kph). However, Hermine still packed enough of a punch to cause flooding in the San Antonio area. Between 1 and 3 inches of rain an hour fell over the city, according to CNN meteorologists, citing weather radar. Hermine could drop between 4 to 6 inches of rain on portions of the state and prompt flash floods, forecasters said. Isolated tornadoes were possible overnight. Portions of Interstate 35 were closed because of flooding over the road in San Antonio, according to the Texas Department of Transportation. At least 22 other roads also were closed by high water, said Melissa Sparks of the San Antonio Fire Department. Strong wind blew off the roof of an apartment complex, said Laura Jesse of the Bexar County fire marshal's office. There were no reports of injuries. ""It's rain and a lot of wind,"" said CNN iReporter Caroline Radtke of San Antonio, who shot a video of the weather spawned by Hermine. ""I'm still wet from it."" She shot her video around noon, and nearly two hours later said, ""It's almost worse now."" Hermine made landfall slightly over the Mexican border near Brownsville, Texas, on Monday night. ""It was pretty loud last night,"" said CNN iReporter Jeremy Williams of Weslaco, Texas, about 45 miles northwest of Brownsville. He said the gusts began to calm about 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., ""but for a while, it was just pounding winds."" He said gusts of up to 60 mph were reported about 20 miles to the east, in Harlingen. A wind gust of 56 mph was reported at Kingsville, Texas, just before 7 a.m. ET, forecasters said. Footage from CNN affiliate KTRK in Galveston, Texas, showed huge waves hammering the coastline. A storm surge was forecast to raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet along southern Texas, forecasters said. Water levels were gradually receding, but will probably remain above normal for the next day or so. Tropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 45 miles from the center of the storm. Williams said he did not lose power, but others in the Rio Grande Valley did. As of about 11 a.m. Tuesday, he said, ""the skies look really clear"" and the sun was out, with temperatures in the mid-80s. ""It's actually really nice out today,"" he said. Joseph Tomaselli, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Brownsville, said flooding and fallen trees, signs, power lines and power poles were reported in Brownsville and Cameron County on Tuesday morning. CNN's Sean Morris and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","NEW: Hermine downgraded to tropical depression .

"(CNN) -- Sitting on the beach enjoying the final day of a perfect vacation with loved ones this week, I marveled at how beautiful life is. The fog rolling off the ocean a sight to cleanse the soul. Then I sat down to read the Special Investigative Report on the Penn State abuse cover-up, and I felt filthy. Pulled back into reality, I was reminded how ugly and cruel the world can be, especially when people we entrust to lead and protect our children fail us. The 267-page report that cites 430 interviews and 3.5 million pieces of e-mail and electronic data tells a story of failure at every level of the university to expose a known child predator. It is enough to make even the most vigilant among us question our faith in humanity. And right off, it implicates those most to blame: . ""Four of the most powerful people at The Pennsylvania State University -- President Graham B. Spanier, Senior Vice President-Finance and Business Gary C. Schultz, Athletic Director Timothy M. Curley and Head Football Coach Joseph V. Paterno -- failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade."" News: More storms looming for Penn State in wake of Freeh report . Joe Paterno and his cohorts failed us all. They let the big money, fame and glory of college sports make them forget to be coaches and mentors, to turn a blind eye to a horror in their midst. They forgot to be decent men. Instead, they thought they were gods. Gods with the power to decide which lives mattered and which could be thrown away. Last month, their former employee Jerry Sandusky, once Penn State's assistant football coach, was convicted of sexually assaulting 10 boys over many years. Somehow these Penn State gods had all concluded that the abused boys were worthless, underprivileged children who were nothing compared to the mighty Nittany Lions. Sports are that intoxicating. Is there really any greater power in American culture than the Sports God? Even now, after all the negative stories surrounding the games, we want to believe -- I want to believe - that in the end sports is one of the best things about our country. As a proud alumna of Penn State, former cheerleader and former JoePa fan, I admit that I was hoping that at least Paterno would turn out to be the good guy in this horrendous story. That somehow he was working internally to help stop those boys from being abused and did more than just report an ""incident to his bosses."" But that is not the case, according to all the evidence. Even his last public words tell us he finally grasped this: . ""It's one of the great sorrows of my life ... In hindsight I wish I had done more."" How exactly does one go to sleep at night having stood by and allowed children to be raped and abused? Do you tell yourself that 1,000 good deeds will erase the pain you've allowed to happen? And how can we make Paterno's last words more than just regrets? Certainly the Sandusky conviction and the Freeh report are a good start. But there's more we can do. It's time for the state of Pennsylvania and other authorities to take a long look at the Second Mile program, its board and all its staff, including Sandusky's wife. After all the covering up around this case, it is not unreasonable to think Sandusky's pedophile playground extended well beyond the walls of Penn State. Freeh's report already leads us down this path, detailing the questionable ties between Second Mile and Penn State, pointing to a land deal between the university and the nonprofit, an ""unusual"" $168,000 payment to Sandusky when he was allowed to retire in 1999 and an agreement to let Sandusky's program hold youth camps and other events on the Penn State campus. These were just a few of the activities that went on after Sandusky was first investigated in 1998 when a mother reported that Sandusky had showered with and groped her 11-year-old boy on Penn State's campus. Showers, it turned out, were a ""regular occurrence"" at the Penn State facility much earlier than 1998, according to Freeh's report. But when staffers were asked why nothing ever was reported, everyone said they either didn't think anything was improper about a grown man showering with boys or they feared losing their jobs. News: Penn State review recasts story of Football hero Paterno . Some may say that I'm being overzealous in calling for more investigations; that I'm piling on. They are wrong. If Sandusky's victims and their parents found the courage to come forward and face their abuser and an entire university, then I think authorities are obligated to ensure that the Second Mile Program is cleaned up and that it is safe for children. (In May, the Second Mile sought court approval to close and transfer its assets to a Texas-based ministry; the request is pending,) If that means finding more boys who were abuse victims of Sandusky or any other staffers there, then that must be done. The cover-up must end. The families who seek support from the Second Mile program deserve justice. Paterno, Spanier, Schultz and Curley were all family men. They had beautiful families. Paterno alone has five children and 17 great-grandchildren. I'm sure these men worked hard and made many sacrifices to give their children every chance to succeed. So did the hard-working parents who sent their kids off to participate in the Second Mile program. They, too, were hoping to provide a better life for their kids, one that may have been beyond their means to reach alone. So they trusted others -- Jerry Sandusky, Second Mile and the Penn State family -- to help shape their children into better citizens and leaders. Certainly, those parents didn't believe the lives of their kids were any less precious than Paterno's. No one told them that ""Jerry's kids"" were expendable. And that even on the hallowed Penn State campus, they were in grave danger. But that's exactly what this sad story tells us now. Those of us in the Penn State family need to stop making excuses for what happened. We should be demanding that any and all association with Second Mile program be severed until there is a full investigation of that program and everyone associated with it. The abuse victims certainly deserve this much and so does the University. News: Penn State leaders 'empowered Sandusky' ""... In hindsight, I wish I had done more."" Let's not have to echo those words ever again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roxanne Jones.","Roxanne Jones: Penn State report implicates four powerful men who failed to protect kids .

"(CNN) -- Campers Steven Haugen and Jeanette Bauman headed out with their Labrador retriever, Caesar, for an overnight camping trip in the Willamette National Forest on June 30, 2005. Steven Haugen, 54, and Jeanette Bauman, 56, were shot to death on a camping trip, along with their Lab, Caesar. The Oregon day was bright and sunny, perfect for hiking and camping. Haugen, 54, Bauman, 56, and Caesar were found shot to death at the couple's campsite the following day. Four years later, the killer continues to elude sheriff's detectives. The case is similar to the double slaying of a mother and daughter a year later in neighboring Washington state. Both sets of victims were slain in rural settings on public lands, and in both cases the victims' vehicles were left at the scene, the Lane County Sheriff's Office said. There is no apparent motive in either case. Haugen was a school counselor and track coach, and Bauman taught business. Neither had any known enemies.  Watch an update on the case » . According to police, the killer took some camping items and the license plate from their 1997 GMC Jimmy SUV. ""It's not clear what the reasoning is. Is it a robbery? We have a profile of the killer or killers with the help of FBI resources. One theory is that it could be a crime of territory,"" said Lt. Randy Smith of the Lane County Sheriff's Office. This week marks the fourth anniversary of the slayings, and police wonder whether the killer could strike again, particularly if the killings were territorial. Police believe that Bauman and Haugen were randomly selected, possibly by someone angry the campers were in ""his woods."" It's also possible that someone spotted them and saw them as prey. Smith said authorities are seeing more territorial disputes in the woods, although they are still rare. ""Whoever did this to my mom and Steven knew these woods well,"" said Gary Bauman, Jeanette Bauman's son. ""Obviously, there are people in the woods with guns, maybe hunters, but I believe my mom and Steven were just at the wrong place at the wrong time."" He is not certain whether Bauman and Haugen were armed but said his mother does not own a gun. ""It's possible Steven may have a handgun, as often campers do for protection from bears,"" he noted. Police say they are not naming any suspects at this time but are watching a group of individuals who fit the profile developed by investigators and who may have been in the area at the time of the slayings. Police are asking for help from the public. Anyone with more information leading to the arrest or conviction of the person or persons responsible for the deaths of Jeanette Bauman and Steven Haugen is asked to call the Lane County Sheriff's Office tip line at 541-682-4167.

"Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney has had a bad couple of weeks, really a bad month since the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida. The media spotlight has relentlessly focused on him. But there is an incumbent in the race, too, and an incumbent with a record that also reveals important disappointments, errors and failures. Over the next month, President Barack Obama will stand on stage beside Romney and submit to press questioning before millions of TV viewers. Here are 10 questions I'd like to hear him answer: . 1) More than 50 U.S. and coalition soldiers have been killed so far this year by supposedly friendly Afghan forces. Two Americans were fatally shot just last week by Afghans we trained and equipped. These so-called ""green on blue"" attacks now account for 14% of all coalition casualties. What questions would you like to ask the candidates? Share a short video question. In 2009, you ordered 33,000 additional U.S. forces into Afghanistan. Three years later, Afghanistan looks no more stable than it did in 2009. Can you tell us specifically what the Afghan surge accomplished? 2) Campaigning in 2008, you called for tearing down the walls that separated the Muslim world from the West. You granted your first post-inauguration interview to Al Arabiyya television and told the interviewer: ""My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy."" You traveled to Cairo, Egypt, in 2009 to deliver a speech offering ""a new beginning"" in U.S. relations with the Islamic world. With the discovery that our ally Pakistan was home to Osama bin Laden, with a 9/11 denialist now elected president of Egypt, with our embassies under attack, with the news only in this past week that an Egyptian schoolteacher was sentenced to six years in prison for postings judged offensive to Islam on his Facebook page and mobs in Bangladesh burning Buddhist temples -- why have your hopes for change been so brutally disappointed? 3) After the lethal attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, U.S. intelligence agencies collected information that the attacks were premeditated and coordinated by elements of al Qaeda in Libya, and timed to the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Yet your administration insisted for more than a week that the attacks were a spontaneous reaction to a YouTube video. Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was sent to five Sunday morning shows to repeat a claim that she -- and you -- had to have known was untrue. The video maker is now under arrest, ostensibly because of parole violations, but pretty obviously for exercising his free-speech rights. Why didn't you just tell the truth to the American people from the start? 4) Can you today guarantee that Iran will not have acquired a nuclear weapon by the time you finish a second term in office? 5) You inherited the worst economic crash since the 1930s. The economy hit bottom in the summer of 2009 and a recovery then began. Congratulations. Yet this recovery has been the slowest and weakest since World War II. Nobody blames you for the collapse. But why shouldn't Americans blame you for the meager record since recovery began more than three years ago? 6) You propose to allow the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 to expire on income above $250,000. That would raise the top rate of federal income tax back to 39.6%. When the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented, the top rate will rise past 40%, including the new health care surtax. Almost all states collect income taxes of their own, rising nearly to 10% in California and even beyond in Oregon. Do you believe there a percentage level at which the government is taking just too much? What is it? 7) You emphasize more college education as the most important way to raise worker wages. Yet even before the Great Recession began, wages were actually dropping for new college graduates. As technology enables the outsourcing of white-collar jobs, too, it's ceasing to be true that a college degree in itself translates into a rising standard of living. Got any other ideas? 8) You've expressed concern about growing wealth disparities in America. One cause of those disparities is the huge surge of low-wage immigration since 1970: almost 30 million newcomers. These newcomers are three times as likely as the native-born to lack a high-school diploma. Even before the Great Recession, they were 50% more likely to be poor than the native-born. The best data show that even the great-grandchildren of low-skill Latino immigrants continue to struggle in the high-tech economy. Your immigration proposals call for granting illegal immigrants a path to citizenship, creating incentives for more illegal entry in the future and continuing family reunification policies that will maintain our present low-skill immigration intake for years and decades to come. How do you reconcile your immigration proposals with your promise to strengthen the American middle class? 9) Your administration reacted to the financial crisis with an $800 billion fiscal stimulus. You promised that it would create jobs and rebuild American infrastructure. Yet Amtrak's latest plan for the Northeast rail corridor can promise no shortening of travel times until the 2040s. Can you give examples of any real-life improvements to our infrastructure that were achieved by your stimulus? Please be as specific as possible. 10) If you're re-elected in 2012, what hope is there that the next four years will be less acrimonious and ineffectual than the past two? Can you acknowledge any fault at all on your own side for the paralysis in Washington -- and what will you change to try to make your second term less rancorous than your first? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: President Obama has a record that should be questioned in the debates .
He says Obama should be asked about results of Afghan surge and ""green-on-blue"" attacks .
Frum: Ask about slow economic recovery and what level of taxation he thinks is too high .
Ask Obama how he would govern differently in second term, Frum says ."
"AUSTIN, Texas (CNET)  -- IMDb founder Col Needham said the massively popular movie database has set as its major goal for the future to add one-button streaming for all of the 1.3 million titles it indexes. IMDb, the popular movie database, hopes to add one-button streaming for all of its 1.3 million titles. Obviously, the vision is a long-term one, Needham acknowledged, and it faces hurdles from the slew of content owners who control the vast library of titles the Internet Movie Database provides information about, but as a leading movie-oriented site, it's a very important goal to articulate in public. Needham was speaking Monday afternoon at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Festival here. Oddly, though his talk was part of the film festival, the room was packed almost entirely by attendees of the associated SXSW Interactive Festival. Ostensibly, Needham was talking about the history of IMDb -- from its founding even before the advent of the World Wide Web, to its launch as a dot-com site to its being bought by Amazon.com. But late in the talk, he explained how he wants to make it possible for the 57 million monthly unique visitors to the site to watch, with the click of one button, all the movies, TV shows, and other video content indexed on the site. It will be difficult to fulfill the vision, Needham said, ""because many of the films may not exist anymore and many may not be available for streaming."" But these days, free or paid streaming of movies is available from a number of sources, including: Netflix, Hulu, TV.com (a part of CBS Interactive, which publishes CNET News), Amazon, iTunes, and others. Each of those sources, though, has its own arrangement with the content owners, so for IMDb to get access to the entire library would be a massive undertaking. Still, rather than being a throw-away line that didn't carry any weight, Needham reiterated at the end of the talk that the vision was one of the company's major goals for 2009 and beyond. Already, IMDb has begun adding streaming content to the site, a program that began in September. Right now, Needham said, there are 14,000 full-length TV episodes and a couple of thousand full-length movies available on the site, as well as 120,000 other pieces of video content, many of which are movie trailers, interviews, and featurettes. And he said that the site is adding thousands of new pieces of video content per week. At that rate, however, it's sure to take the site quite some time to achieve the goal. Needham said he imagined a time three years from now when we will all look back at early 2009, when so many media sites are trying to solve the problem of making content available to those who want it in the face of resistance from the Recording Industry Association of America and Motion Picture Association of America, and we'll shake our heads at where we were at.

"(OPRAH.com)  -- It was a beautiful -- no, a perfect -- day. Until a kindly but clueless grandma asked The Question That Must Never Be Posed to Any Woman, Ever. In the spirit of forgiveness, this columnist resolves to breathe in and let go...but not before recalling a landfill of grudges, slights, insults, and snarky remarks. About three weeks after my daughter, Julia, was born, I was standing in line at Russ & Daughters, a lovely little shoebox of a shop that's been serving the most exquisite Jewish delicacies ever since Mr. Russ loaded up his pushcart and headed for the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1908. I was ordering smoked butterfish and nova, sliced thinner than angel wings, as the guys behind the counter plied me with samples of apricot strudel and raspberry rugelach. It was spring, my baby was healthy, Russ & Daughters had just put out their marble nut halvah, and all was right with the world. I was experiencing what the late, great Spalding Gray used to call ""a perfect moment."" Please note, Mr. Gray didn't talk about perfect days, he didn't even refer to a perfect half-hour stretch. Nope, he only suggested that there are moments when life is inexorably sweet, but those moments are few and far between -- and generally over before you can capture them on the teeny camera in your ridiculously tricked-out cell phone. The adorable grandma to my left decided to strike up a conversation: ""So, how long have you been coming here, dear?"" She smelled like Pond's Cold Cream and cinnamon, and I liked her immediately. ""Well, ma'am, my aunt Bernice first brought me here when I was just a kid,"" I answered between bites. She smiled warmly and told me she grew up right around the corner, on Orchard Street, and had shopped here since the 1920s. ""I raised five children on this food,"" she said, pointing to the baked blueberry farmer's cheese. We were soulmates in sable, partners in pickled herring; we spoke the language of lox. And that's when it happened. My new buddy suddenly reached out her bony little liver-spotted hand, patted my baby-free middle, and asked the one question nobody should ever ask: ""When are you due?"" I toyed with the possibility that she had some sort of death wish. Perhaps the question was actually a thinly veiled plea. I mean, isn't it plausible that what she was really saying was ""I want to go out on a high note, so I'll just have a taste of chopped liver, and then do something so heinous that it drives this perfectly reasonable woman to club me to death with a side of salmon""? Oprah.com: How to survive a verbal ambush . Questions never to ask . You see, there are certain questions that must never be asked: . 1. Has your surprise party happened yet? 2. How did you first learn that your husband is cheating? And, above all: . 3. When are you due? I don't care if the woman you're asking is wearing a T-shirt with a giant rhinestone-encrusted arrow that points to her belly and reads BABY ON BOARD. I don't care if she's writhing on a gurney in the birthing room of Mount Sinai hospital, screaming for an epidural as an obstetrician announces, ""One more push and the baby will be out!"" You never, let me repeat, never, ever, under any circumstances, ask a woman when she's due. ""June,"" I replied. Some people collect coins, some prowl the Internet for vintage guitars; I know a woman with a closet full of antique Kewpie-doll heads. I'm not totally clear what turned her against everything from the neck down -- she may have been frightened by a Barbie breast as a child. But I'm nobody to judge, because I, too, am a collector. What I collect are slights, digs, withering remarks, and the occasional mean-girl glare. I examine a good when-are-you-due story from every angle, I trade them with friends, I commit them to memory, I savor them for eternity. Insults that live forever . Here are a few of my favorite insults: . My old friend Suzanna remembers the first time she had her Hungarian husband's family over. She cooked for three straight days. The woman goulashed and paprikashed and put her tomato sauce through a food mill, for God's sake. At the end of the meal, her new mother-in-law took Suzie's hands in hers, looked her straight in the eye, and said: ""I'm so glad you feel you can practice on us."" Ouch. My former roommate Laurie came home with an A+ on her test and proudly handed the paper to her father. ""Interesting,"" he said. ""I always thought you had to be really smart to get this kind of grade."" Kaboom. My pal Faye tells the story of spending an entire evening with a guy she met when they both reached for the same stuffed zucchini blossom at a fancy fundraiser. He suggested they get together the very next day for a picnic in Central Park, and she was delighted to take charge of the fried chicken and potato salad. The next day she waited and waited. Two hours, one drumstick, half a pound of red bliss potatoes, and five weeks of dieting down the drain later, Faye picked up the phone: ""What happened?"" His reply: ""Well, I honked...but you didn't come out."" Yikes. I bring Jules to the pediatrician for her annual checkup. ""Would you say she's unusually tall?"" I ask, hoping that she'll someday be able to reach all the stuff her 5'2"" mother cannot. ""No, she's average,"" he replies, quick and to the point. ""Are you sure?"" I persist. ""My friends all tell me that she's really quite tall."" The good doctor peers down his bifocals. ""Maybe your friends don't want to tell you that she's really quite average."" Touché. Forget about kids; grown-ups say the darnedest things. Sometimes they mean well, sometimes they mean to lacerate, sometimes they're just clueless. The challenge (at least for me) is not to take any of it personally...even when it's meant personally. Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me, unless of course I decide to let them. But it's a brand new year, and I've resolved to make a few changes. I don't want to lock and load when a nasty comment comes my way, but I also refuse to duck and cover. Instead, I am going to answer clumsiness with equanimity, bitchiness with compassion, and verbal violence with disengagement. I think it's a damn good plan -- wise, tolerant, even kind of Zen. If I play my cards right, I could be crowned Miss Mental Health 2009! There's just one teeny, tiny problem: I honestly believe Metallica's next-door neighbor stands a better chance of getting a good night's sleep without ear plugs and an Ambien than I stand of actually getting this plan to work. But that certainly doesn't mean it's not worth a try. So I will seek, to paraphrase Saint Francis of Assisi, not to be understood but to understand. I will send my collection of slights to Sotheby's and have them auction it off to the highest bidder, one dig at a time, and if none of my attempts at happiness and harmony pays off, well then, I'm heading for halvah at Russ & Daughters.

"(CNN) -- When Bono took the stage at the TED2013 Conference in Long Beach, California, the U2 front man told the audience he had embraced his ""inner nerd."" ""Exit the rock star,"" Bono said, ""Enter the evidence-based activist - the factivist."" The speech was a call to action. Extreme global poverty has already been cut in half over the past 20 years, from 43% in 1990 to 21% in 2010. Bono said that if the current trajectory can be continued, extreme poverty could be virtually eliminated by 2030. TED.com: Bono: 8 talks that give me hope . There has been astonishing progress in other areas of human development. More than 8 million people are on life-saving antiretroviral drugs, compared with only 200,000 a decade ago. In eight sub-Saharan African countries, malaria deaths have been cut by 75%; the rate of child mortality for those under 5 is down by 2.65 million deaths a year since 2000. That's all great news, but there are two things that should give us pause. First, not enough people have any idea of the successes in the fight against global diseases and poverty. ""It drives me nuts,"" said Bono, ""that most people don't seem to know this news."" TED.com: What does extreme poverty look like today? Second, the gains the world has made are in jeopardy. They could be reversed with cuts to the budgets for vital institutions like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; they could be stopped in their tracks if the world allows corruption, inequality, apathy and inertia to dictate the pace -- or lack of it -- of progress. TED.com: Do we need more worldwide development goals? But if the world keeps the promises that it has made to itself to really fight extreme poverty and preventable disease, then nothing is impossible. Bono argued that if we used transparency -- which tackles corruption like nothing else -- and technology, we can get closer to the ""Zero Zone,"" where extreme poverty is virtually eliminated by 2028. Then this generation would be what Nelson Mandela once challenged it to be: the ""Great Generation"" that did away with -- in Mandela's words, the ""most awful offense against humanity"" that extreme poverty represents. TED.com: The quest to end poverty . Factivism, Bono said at TED2013, is a virtuous, data-based virus, and challenged his audience to ""spread it, share it, pass it on ... by doing so, you will join us and countless others in what I truly believe is the greatest journey ever taken -- the ever-demanding journey of equality.""

"(CNN) -- At the end of July, the Senate intelligence committee marked up legislation drafted in response to recent high-profile leaks of classified information. The committee's chairwoman, Dianne Feinstein, claims that the bill will address the ""culture of leaks"" in Washington. But the leaks are a symptom of the intelligence community's culture of secrecy -- and the bill would make that problem worse in a host of ways. Any insider will tell you that the government classifies far too much information. Top military and national security officials estimate that between 50% and 90% of classified documents could safely be released. That adds up to a massive amount of unnecessary secrecy when one considers there were 92 million decisions to classify information in 2011 alone. The WikiLeaks disclosures featured some vivid examples, such as a cable from an American diplomat who classified his description of a typical wedding in the province of Dagestan. The impetus for the current Senate bill -- a series of leaks of classified information that may have been implicitly or explicitly ""authorized"" by top administration officials -- illustrates the problem. High-level intelligence officials are not enemies of the state. If they are approving the disclosure of classified information, it's a pretty safe bet the material didn't require classifying in the first place. News: Senate moves to crack down on national security leaks . Take the fact that President Obama is personally involved in identifying the targets of drone strikes, as reported by The New York Times, one of the disclosures that prompted congressional action. It is virtually impossible to fantasize a scenario in which this information could be used to harm the United States. Overclassification contributes directly to leaks that threaten national security. As Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart commented in 1971, ""when everything is classified, then nothing is classified, and the system becomes one to be disregarded by the cynical or the careless, and to be manipulated by those intent on self-protection or self-promotion."" Put simply, officials who routinely see innocuous documents stamped ""Secret"" lose respect for the system, and that puts all secrets, the real ones as well as the purely nominal ones, at risk. Excessive classification also means that even low-level or nonsensitive government positions often require clearances. One in every 50 American adults now has access to classified information, not a winning formula for keeping secrets. The Senate bill, however, does nothing serious to address the problem of overclassification. Indeed, it perpetuates the fiction that all classified information poses a dire threat. The bill strips intelligence community employees of their pensions if the Director of National Intelligence decides they leaked classified information, even if the information reveals only that Dagestani weddings last three days. It revokes the clearances of officials who disclose the existence of classified covert operations -- even if the operations, like the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, are in the past and could not possibly be jeopardized by disclosure. Worse, the Senate bill extends the shroud of secrecy to encompass even unclassified information. Intelligence officials already must submit any publications that discuss their work to their agencies for pre-publication review and approval; under the bill, they must submit ""anticipated oral remarks"" as well. On its face, the provision could require pre-publication review for dinner party conversations. The bill also bars current and recent intelligence officials from contracting with the media to provide commentary on any intelligence or national security matters. No member of the intelligence community, for instance, could provide paid commentary on the war in Afghanistan. Opinion: Obama leak 'scandal' is wildly overblown . Most alarming of all, the bill prohibits any intelligence official other than the agency's director, deputy director or designated public affairs officer from providing off-the-record information ""regarding intelligence activities"" -- classified or unclassified -- to the media. If successful, this provision would ensure that the public hears only the party line on all matters relating to intelligence policy. It also would effectively prohibit whistleblowing. Intelligence officials could raise concerns through approved government channels, but if that failed would have no meaningful way to bring evidence of government fraud, waste, abuse, or illegality to the public's attention. How to deal with disclosures of classified information about government misconduct is a tricky question. How to deal with disclosures of unclassified information about government misconduct should be a no-brainer. Such disclosures should be welcomed and encouraged. The law already falls short in this regard: the Whistleblower Protection Act protects other government employees against retaliation for whistle-blowing, but excludes members of the intelligence community. The Senate bill would turn this lack of protection into a virtual prohibition. Unauthorized leaks of properly classified information are a real problem. Grandstanding about authorized leaks of improperly classified information will not solve this problem, nor will cracking down on disclosures of unclassified information. If Congress wants to get serious about leaks, it will take steps to shrink the universe of secret government information, not expand it to encompass yet more information the public has every right to know. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elizabeth Goitein.","Elizabeth Goitein: Leaks are a symptom of the intelligence community's culture of secrecy .

"Washington (CNN) -- An undercover investigation by the Federal Trade Commission found funeral homes nationwide deceived customers into making purchases they weren't required to make and failed to give up-front pricing to customers. Undercover FTC agents posing as customers found ""significant violations"" in 23 of the 102 funeral homes investigated, according to the FTC. Operators violated key provisions of the ""Funeral Rule,"" a 1984 regulation the FTC put in place to prevent funeral home operators from forcing customers to buy caskets or any other item as a condition of paying for a funeral. Another provision of the rule requires funeral homes to provide an itemized price list during the first in-person funeral arrangement meeting. Nationally, Richmond and Fredericksburg, Virginia had the highest number of funeral homes found with significant violations, according to the FTC's report. Eight of the 19 funeral homes investigated in the two cities committed significant violations. Columbia, South Carolina, was next with five significant violations out of 10 funeral homes inspected. Thirty-three funeral homes had what the FTC called minor compliance issues. In those cases, the FTC contacted the funeral homes and required proof they were addressing violations. The FTC gives funeral homes an opportunity to right their wrongs before they're hauled into court. A three-year program run by the National Funeral Directors Association gives participants extra training and additional compliance monitoring. Funeral homes that participate are allowed to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury in place of a civil penalty. Civil penalties can be up to $16,000 per violation, according to the FTC. Jessica Koth of the National Funeral Directors Association says the ""NFDA takes compliance with the Funeral Rule seriously."" Koth says the organization encourages members to meet all obligations. Since the annual undercover stings began in 1996, the FTC said investigators have found fewer than 400 funeral homes with significant violations. There are 19,680 funeral homes in the United States, according to the NFDA. FTC inspections during 2011 encountered varying levels of compliance: . -- In northwestern Indiana, one of 12 funeral homes inspected had significant violations; . -- In Maui, Hawaii, none of the four funeral homes inspected had significant violations; . -- In the New York City area, as well as parts of Connecticut and New Jersey, one of 22 funeral homes inspected had significant violations; . -- In Cleveland, four of 16 funeral homes inspected had significant violations; . -- In Columbia, South Carolina, five significant violations were found in 10 funeral homes inspected; . -- In Austin, Texas, four of 19 funeral homes inspected had significant violations; . -- In Richmond and Fredericksburg, Virginia, eight of 19 funeral homes inspected had significant violations.","'Significant violations' found in 23 of 102 funeral homes investigated .

"(CNN) -- It's been more than a month since Jerry Mann's 9,000-acre farm has gotten rain, and when the 56-year-old Montana man examines the dry, shriveling kernels of wheat and barley, he's understandably nervous. ""We're looking at a 30-40% drop in the usual yield if we don't get some rain here real soon,"" he said. The high Tuesday in Great Falls, Montana, is 95, a number that pales in comparison to the triple digits seen recently in other parts of the country, but presents major problems for its residents -- particularly those involved in agriculture. Extreme weather: Get ready to see more of it . With cooling temperatures in the South and Midwest, national attention has shifted to Arizona and California, where temperatures are well above 100. But the real story is temperatures up to 15 degrees above normal in northwestern cities such as Great Falls, according to CNN meteorologist Sarah Dillingham. Mann, 56, knows the land and knows the crops. He was born into farming, and on that land he's raised wheat, barley and a family. A 30% to 40% drop in yield, of course, means a 30% to 40% drop in income. ""You worry,"" he said, sighing. ""But there's nothing you can do about it."" The heat came early this year, but it isn't uncommon for Montana temperatures to swing wildly, said Great Falls Fire Chief Randall McCamley. It's one of the things he likes about Great Falls, where he has lived for 30 years. ""We can break a record high and a record low on the same day here,"" he said. ""It keeps us guessing."" Though untimely, the temperatures in Montana haven't caused any heat-related deaths, state officials said. But at least 51 people elsewhere in the United States have died from heat-related -- or heat-exacerbated -- causes in the past two weeks. It is difficult to determine an exact number because of a lag time in official counts and differences in the states' standards. Triple-digit strategies for staying healthy . The National Weather Service has issued excessive heat warnings for parts of Arizona, California and Nevada through Wednesday, with temperatures forecast to peak Tuesday at 113 degrees in Las Vegas; 113 in Phoenix; 116 degrees in Yuma, Arizona; and 125 degrees in Death Valley, California. In the Las Vegas Valley, local officials are opening up cooling stations Tuesday to give residents a place to beat the heat. Forecast highs in the 100s will continue into next week. But as the Southwest heated up, the rest of the nation began returning to normal summertime temperatures. A cold front pushed through the Midwest, as well as parts of the South and mid-Atlantic states, sparking severe storms and heavy rain in some areas. The cool-down follows a heat wave that roasted much of the country for more than a week and comes as the National Climatic Data Center reported the mainland United States has experienced the warmest 12 months since record-keeping began in 1895. Past twelve months warmest ever recorded in U.S. The report does not take into account blistering heat from this month, with 2,116 high-temperature marks either broken or tied between July 2 and July 8 in communities nationwide. But it does incorporate the warmest March recorded as well as extreme heat in June, which also helped make the first six months of 2012 the warmest recorded of any January-June stretch. ""There are a lot of things going on that have been very unusual over the last several months,"" said Dev Niyogi, earth and atmospheric sciences professor at Purdue University. In the last half of June, 170 all-time temperature records were matched or smashed in cities across the lower 48 states. The U.S. State Climate Extremes Committee also is reviewing whether 113-degree temperatures in South Carolina and 112-degree recordings in Georgia qualify as all-time records in those two states.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Senate unanimously voted to tighten sanctions on Iran on Monday, three days after a dispute over whether to include the threat of American force stalled the legislation. The new sanctions would target Iran's oil and banking industries, as well as other sectors. The measure passed the Senate on a voice vote Monday evening, two days before a new round of talks between Iran and leading U.N. members in Baghdad. ""Today the Senate has showed we can still act in a bipartisan way on important priorities,"" said Sen. Tim Johnson, D-South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Passage came after senators agreed to add language warning that military force would be an option available to the United States if Iran seeks to build a nuclear weapon. But the measure also states that nothing in the legislation authorizes military action. Missile shield in place, NATO chief says . The House of Representatives passed a similar bill in December, but demands for those competing messages stalled the bill in the Senate last week. Republicans blocked passage after complaints that the language wasn't tough enough, leading Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, to complain that he was being ""jerked around."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said the legislation now makes clear that ""all options"" could be considered, echoing previous statements by President Barack Obama. ""I hope sanctions will work,"" Graham said. ""But this is a clear statement by the United States Senate, backing up our president, that when it comes to Iran having a nuclear capability, there will be more than sanctions on the table -- and the Iranians need to know that."" Meanwhile, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul insisted on language that explicitly noted that nothing in the bill ""shall be construed as a declaration of war or an authorization of the use of force"" against either Iran or Syria, an Iranian ally now fighting a popular uprising against its government. Paul, the son of two-time GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul, was pleased by the bill's passage, spokeswoman Moira Bagley told CNN. Security Clearance: Iran propping up Syria's cash reserves . And Reid said after the vote, ""Iranians need to know we mean business."" Aides from both parties said the House and Senate bills will need to be reconciled after the Senate amendments. Iran has insisted that its production of enriched uranium is meant to fuel civilian nuclear power plants, and U.S. intelligence believes any previous weapons-related research was halted in 2003. But the Islamic republic has refused international demands to halt its nuclear fuel program, and the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said in November that it was up to Iran to demonstrate the peaceful nature of its atomic research. Iran says U.N. talks pave way for negotiations . Meanwhile, Iran's economy has been crippled by existing sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union. Eighty percent of Iran's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports, and an embargo by the EU set to go into effect in July will put further pressure on its economy. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Iranians need to know we mean business,"" Sen. Harry Reid says .

"(EW.com) -- Look guys, sometimes box office articles just need four headlines! In this case, the under-performance of ""The Five-Year Engagement"" wasn't the only big story this weekend. ""Think Like A Man"" notched a very strong sophomore frame, ""The Hunger Games"" reached a truly remarkable milestone, and ""The Avengers"" flexed their muscles internationally. Oh, and ""Safe"" and ""The Raven"" also entered theaters. We've got a lot to talk about! Here's how the box office shook out: . Ensemble comedy ""Think Like A Man,"" an adaptation of Steve Harvey's famous advice book, ""Act Like A Lady, Think Like A Man,"" dropped by 46 percent to $18 million -- enough to easily top the box office for a second frame in a row. Compared to other comedies with predominantly African-American casts, ""Think Like A Man's"" second weekend drop is quite strong. Recent titles like ""Jumping the Broom"" and Tyler Perry's ""Good Deeds"" fell by 55 percent and 54 percent, respectively, in their sophomore frames. ""Think Like A Man"" maintained a robust per theater average of $8,933, which was over twice as much as the average for any other film in the Top 20. After ten days, Think has earned $60.9 million, and it now seems headed for a finish near $90 million. Not too shabby for a film that cost Sony just $12 million to produce! The Hunger Games: Get the latest news, photos, and more . There's another Sony title in second place. Aardman Animation's ""The Pirates! Band of Misfits"" earned $11.4 million over its first three days. The $55 million stop-motion animation has already earned $63.7 million overseas, so it didn't need a gigantic debut Stateside to sail to profitability. The film, which earned a ""B"" CinemaScore grade benefited greatly from the lack of other family films at the box office. 76 percent of ""Pirates'"" audience were children under 12 (49 percent) and parents (27 percent), and it's big Friday-to-Saturday jump from $2.8 million to $5.1 million (85 percent) is indicative of family playability. Interestingly, despite the beardy cast and swashbuckling storyline, only 46 percent of the audience was male, though, which means that women made up the predominant audience for the Top 5 films at the box office this weekend. The Zac Efron/Taylor Schilling romance ""The Lucky One"" finished in third place with $11.3 million -- a drop of 50 percent. After ten days, the Nicholas Sparks adaptation has earned $39.9 million -- already a much better total than the last Efron-led picture, ""Charlie St. Cloud,"" which grossed just $31.2 million in its entire 2010 run. Close behind, ""The Hunger Games"" dipped by a tiny 23 percent and earned $11.3 million in its sixth weekend on the chart. With a running total of $372.5 million, the franchise-launching blockbuster is now officially performing ahead of the highest-grossing ""Harry Potter"" film, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2,"" which had earned $366 million at the same point in its run. Worldwide, ""Hunger Games'"" impressive $601 million total doesn't compare to Potter's grosses, but one can only wonder how high numbers will climb by the time ""The Hunger Games Saga: Catching Fire -- Part 2"" (Section B) in IMAX 3D finally hits theaters in 2016. ""The Five-Year Engagement"" settled for a fifth place debut (although every movie from No. 2 to No. 5 could shuffle around over the next 24 hours) with $11.2 million. While many prognosticators (like this one) thought the film would top the chart, Universal claims it was always expecting an opening in the low double-digits. Still, the result seems very disappointing given the massive success of ""Bridesmaids,"" which earned $169 million last year, and the date night-viability of 2012 titles like ""The Vow"" and ""The Lucky One."" The Emily Blunt/Jason Segel rom-com earned a lackluster ""B-"" CinemaScore grade from polled audiences, which were 64 percent female. Fortunately, the film cost a modest $30 million to produce. Two thrillers failed to ignite much excitement at the box office this weekend. Jason Statham's latest, ""Safe,"" notched a weak $7.7 million -- a low start even for Statham -- while John Cusack's Edgar Allen Poe-themed effort ""The Raven"" couldn't escape its sepulcher down by the sea. It found only $7.3 million. Audiences gave ""Safe"" a ""B+"" CinemaScore grade and ""The Raven"" a ""B."" Overseas, the big story is Marvel's ""The Avengers,"" which broke the opening weekend record in 12 countries, including Mexico ($15.9 million) and Brazil ($11.3 million). The Disney-distributed superhero title has now grossed a stunning $178.4 million in just five days -- and it still hasn't hit powerhouse markets China, Russia, or Japan. This bodes very well for ""The Avengers'"" U.S. debut next weekend. Will it break the opening weekend record? 1. Think Like A Man -- $18 million . 2. The Pirates!

"(CNN) -- This summer, Earls Court in London will be the venue for Olympic volleyball, but last night Samsung hired this vast space to launch a single product -- its new flagship phone, the Galaxy S III. (We really liked it incidentally, check out our hands-on preview here). Hiring such a large space and filling it full of tech heads from all over the world was a sign of extreme confidence from the Korean electronics giant, and you only have to take a look at its last set of figures to see where the bravado is coming from. Net profit for the quarter was 5.05tn won, up 81%, and the main driver for this success was Samsung's Galaxy range of phones. The Galaxy range has certainly been selling like hot cakes. This week, trend-watchers IDC put the company ahead of the competition in its latest state of the market analysis. What's interesting to me is how different Samsung's strategy is to its other major smartphone competitor, Apple. There is only one iPhone released every year, and design-wise, each one has been broadly the same as the previous model, with the same size screen. Read more: Samsung unveils Galaxy S III smartphone with face, voice recognition . In contrast, Samsung has a bewildering number of different models that, viewed together, make almost no sense at all to the casual observer. This might seem like a recipe for confusion, but it also means that that Samsung has a phone to suit pretty much every potential customer. Want something pocketable that's cheap? There's a Samsung Galaxy for that. Need lots of power, a massive screen and a stylus to draw pictures with? Samsung Galaxy can help. And on it goes. Apple is fantastic at making a product that's very aspirational, and it makes an enormous amount of money on every iPhone, but in terms of simply shifting a lot of phones and achieving huge scale, it's Samsung that has the winning strategy. Both Apple and Samsung are so successful in fact, the battle for the top smartphone slot is starting to look like a two-horse race. But it won't necessarily always be this way. HTC was the darling of the mobile industry a while back until Samsung arrived to eat its lunch. The transformation in the company's fortunes was rapid, and there's every possibility that Samsung could see an equally rapid turnaround at some point in the future -- in mobiles, you're only as good as your last hit product. There's also a chance that Samsung's scale could turn out to be a weakness as well as a strength. In some respects, Samsung reminds me of Sony in the years before it all went wrong. There are lots of divisions that don't appear to communicate with each other very well, making a vast number of different products, most of which are decent, but not outstanding. Read more: New Samsung 'not for everyone' There's a desire to be the number one player in every category Samsung is in, which is laudable, but probably unachievable. Does Samsung really need to be the number one maker of cameras in the world? Or MP3 players? Probably not. I can't help but wonder whether its smartphone profits are covering up some deeper organizational problems. Then again, it seems to be working for now, so it may all turn out fine. If a company was to snatch the smartphone crown from Samsung, which would it be? One answer might be Nokia, which may seem like a crazy thing to say following its latest set of disastrous financial results. But there is still a chance that it might not be game over. Nokia's flagship mobile running Microsoft's Windows Phone, the Lumia 900, has recently appeared in America to decent critical acclaim. In the U.S., Android doesn't have quite the same grip on the market that it does in the UK in particular, so there's an outside chance Nokia could sell enough handsets to convince developers deal with the platform's biggest problem -- a lack of apps. If that happens, the launch of Windows Phone 8 could open the whole field up again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Jenkins.","Jenkins: Samsung's strategy different to its main rival, Apple .

"London (CNN) -- If your mother is one of the world's best-loved children's authors who has written more than 70 books and sold well in excess of 11.5 million copies, you might think about taking a different career path. Not Clara Vulliamy. Undaunted by the success of her mother Shirley Hughes, whose creations include Dogger and the Alfie series, Vulliamy has followed her lead. She has written and illustrated 25 children's books and -- like her mother -- wrote her first book soon after having children of her own. Now the mother-daughter team have collaborated for the first time on a new series called ""Dixie O'Day"", written by Hughes and illustrated by Vulliamy, with the first book to be published in September 2013. It will be the first time in a career spanning 53 years that Hughes, 85, has had her words illustrated by someone else. She said it was ""absolutely marvelous"" to work with her daughter. ""I loved it,"" said Hughes. ""Clara's illustrations surprised as well as delighted me. She put things into the book I would never have dreamed of doing myself."" Vulliamy's influence is immediately apparent: Hughes's books are known for their realistic portrayal of everyday family dramas, from lost toys to days at the seaside. But, at Vulliamy's suggestion, the heroes of Dixie O'Day are two dogs in suits. She is used to writing about animals, while her mother never before has. ""I just can't put into words how much I have enjoyed it,"" said Vulliamy, 50, of working with her mother. ""We sat at the same kitchen table working together in the house that I grew up in. We came up with the story together and talked about the illustrations. We laughed a lot."" Vulliamy insists she was never intimated by following such a successful mother. ""She is such a treasured part of so many people's family lives,"" said Vulliamy. ""That doesn't make me feel daunted. I feel 10 feet tall."" Vulliamy is the youngest of three children of Hughes and her late husband John Vulliamy and it was obvious from a young age she had inherited her mother's talent for words and pictures. ""I knew Clara was going to draw, from the earliest years,"" said Hughes. ""She was especially interested in narrative drawing - telling a story in pictures - which was just the same with me when I was small."" Vulliamy grew up watching her mother drawing, but had no idea that she was a famous author. ""I didn't really realize she was famous at any point when I was a child,"" she said. ""It might be because children are taken up with themselves. I just thought she was my mum. It wasn't until I was grown up that I realized."" Vulliamy also said her mother neither read her own books to her children nor taught them to draw, but remembers her work being pushed to one side of the table in their home in west London at mealtimes. ""There was time and space to do my own thing,"" said Vulliamy. ""It was a hands-off, creative environment. ""I first started writing my own stories and doing illustrations when I was five. I just drew and made things and when I ran out of paper I started on the walls. There was nothing else I ever wanted to do."" Vulliamy went to art school and began her career painting portraits and doing illustrations for newspapers. But two weeks after her first child Jack, now 21, was born, Vulliamy began her new career as an author and wrote her first book, ""Ellen and Penguin."" ""Perhaps the huge life change of having a child revealed to me what was there all along,"" she said. That book, like most she has written since, took between three and six months to complete. ""I have an over-flowing waste paper basket and the words take me a really long time,"" said Vulliamy. ""Sometimes I can spend all morning writing one sentence and all afternoon rubbing it out."" Vulliamy is best known for her books The Bear With Sticky Paws and Martha and the Bunny Brothers. A new book, ""I heart bedtimes (Martha and the Bunny Brothers) is due out in the UK on March 28. Her illustrations are bold, simple and are usually of fully-clothed, talking animals; very different from her mother's intricate and realistic drawings of children. At 85, Hughes has cut down on her traveling, but has no intention of retiring from her writing. ""I would much rather not retire at all,"" said Hughes. ""I love working, and a full morning's work is still very much part of my daily routine."" Shirley Hughes will appear with Clara and her two sons Ed and Tom Vulliamy in a talk called ""Keeping it in the Family"" at Oxford Literary Festival on March 16.","Children's author Shirley Hughes has written more than 70 books and sold more than 11.5 million copies .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama called Friday for Congress to fund proposals to expand public-private programs to build and repair modern ports, pipelines, schools and other infrastructure. At a campaign-style event in Miami, Obama said strengthening the nation's infrastructure should be a non-partisan issue because it helps American business and creates jobs for the construction industry. ""We can't afford Washington politics to stand in the way of America's progress,"" Obama said, adding that ""ultimately, Congress has to fund these projects."" Obama's proposals followed up on his call in this year's State of the Union address for such public-private partnerships to strengthen infrastructure development. A White House aide told reporters traveling with Obama on Air Force One that the proposals outlined Friday would cost $21 billion, but added that they would not add to the federal deficit. ""Their impact on the economy will be substantially greater because they will be leveraged two to one, three to one, four to one, up to seven to one depending upon the particular program,"" said Alan Krueger, the chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. He added that ""they will not increase the deficit by a dime because they are paid for in our budget."" Obama's budget for next year is due in coming weeks. Obama has unsuccessfully sought congressional approval throughout his presidency for a more aggressive national investment in road, rail, bridge and energy infrastructure construction to create jobs and spur economic growth. While some states have embraced private-public partnerships, Congress has been less receptive, partly because Republicans want to offset any new spending with cuts elsewhere. Lawmakers from both parties are also wary of losing more control over decisions on the scope and pace of infrastructure development, a key area of federal spending that they can direct to their states and districts. Proponents of public-private partnerships argue that the nation's aging infrastructure needs repair broadly and modernization. But shrinking federal, state and local budgets as well as less revenue overall from other traditional financing sources, like fuel taxes, have undercut efforts to keep pace with demand. The American Society of Civil Engineers said in a 2013 assessment that the United States had a ""significant backlog of overdue maintenance"" across infrastructure systems and a ""pressing need for modernization."" For instance, the group estimates it will cost $21 billion to bring critical, aging dams up to speed. It also says one in nine of the nation's bridges are rated as structurally deficient and spending on overall maintenance and construction is roughly $8 billion short of what's necessary to keep them in good shape. More than 40 percent of America's major urban highways remain congested, costing the economy an estimated $101 billion in wasted time and fuel annually, the engineering group said. Private equity, corporations and other investors have lined up billions to spend on projects that offer a financial return over time or other benefits, such as tax breaks. However, the lack of federal policy or new funding commitments for such arrangements has slowed that approach. Obama favors a new bond-financing program similar to a now-expired one that was created for states and municipalities to stimulate infrastructure construction. He also called for creation of a federally run infrastructure bank aimed at attracting outside investment, an idea he has floated previously that Congress has yet to embrace. A White House document on the plan said the proposed $10 billion infrastructure bank would raise as much as $200 billion in leveraged private investment. Citing a Miami tunnel project endorsed by both the city's chamber of commerce and labor unions, he said such agreement showed that politicians also should be able to sign on.","NEW: Obama says Washington politics shouldn't slow America's progress .

"London (CNN) -- Cyber security is big news right now. It seems a new high-profile breach is reported almost daily and yet this represents only the very tip of the iceberg. Backed by a highly organized black market worth billions of dollars, cybercrime has grown exponentially in scale and sophistication in recent years. In the face of this mounting threat, government and industry are manning the defenses. But finding the right people to protect some of our most valuable data isn't straightforward and requires a new approach. Over the past three years I have competed in a unique set of security games, backed by UK government, industry, academics and professional bodies, known as the Cyber Security Challenge. This aims to find talented amateurs by testing their skills with realistic competitions. Read more: International cyber attacks on the rise . In my time playing the Challenge I have come face to face (or face to screen) with many dangerous viruses and computer code, and defended networks from simulated live-hacking attempts carried out by the UK's leading cyber defense experts. Last week, I was fortunate enough to be crowned the UK's cyber security champion. It's an experience that has taught me much about the skills required to defend a computer system, but also about the difficulties the industry faces finding people with these skills. This is a major problem as cyber-attacks become more frequent and threaten us on various levels. The first aspect is the threat posed to the internet-using public. Scam emails and infected websites still represent a major source of income for cyber criminals. From a technical point these threats are easily solved through freely available anti-virus software and the use of decent solid passwords for your online accounts. However, the attacks continue due to the ease of bypassing these defenses by compromising the user. Technical defenses are of little use if the user clicks on the wrong link or accepts security warnings automatically without question. The fact these scams are still out there shows they are still effective and we have some way to go to educate the public on safe use of the internet. Above this sits corporate and industrial vulnerability that threatens organisations' most valuable data -- be it financial records, customer data or intellectual property. The UK government has placed the potential cost of a single corporate cyber-attack in the hundreds of millions and it's not just traditional technology and internet-based companies that are at risk. Whether it is the pharmaceutical industry where I work, aerospace companies or even the food industry, all own private information that could be of significant value and potentially accessible for those who know how. The highest level of threat represents the potential for state-sponsored attacks and future ""cyber warfare"" exposing vulnerabilities of our critical national infrastructure to online attack. While the nature of this threat landscape is uncertain, the potential damage a cyber-attack could pose to our internet-dependent telecommunications, power and even water infrastructure, has seen cyber security rise sharply up government agendas around the world in the last five years. With cyber security a recognized priority at all levels of society, it is not that surprising that employers of this profession such as those I have met through playing the Challenge are on the lookout for new talent to fill increasing job vacancies. However they face their own challenge uncovering people for these jobs. Our education system in the UK has yet to catch up with a young, rapidly growing and ever-changing industry. My IT lessons focused on the use of software rather than its development or how to secure it. And while there are people who like me developed this knowledge and skills off their own back, there is still limited information out there about cyber security as a career option. I always saw it as more of a hobby, or a source of intellectual challenges, but never a genuine job possibility with the potential to progress upwards within a business or organization. This has all changed since playing the Challenge where the excitement of the profession, and the variety and diversity of employers has shown myself and many of the thousands of other Challenge participants, what this sector could offer them. The key is how they have gone about it using realistic and engaging games and exciting problem-solving activities developed by the professions themselves that inspire talented potential recruits to utilize and hone their skills to tackle real-life problems. While the Challenge won't solve our recruitment issues on its own it is vital that countries like the UK look outside of the traditional academic pathways if they are to build a healthy pipeline of cyber defenders to protect internet users from those that wish them harm. As someone with no formal training in this sector, I know as well as anyone that the skills for the good fight can be in anyone and as a nation we must not ignore this pool of untapped talent if we are to keep the internet a safe place for us all to enjoy. The views expressed in this column are solely those of Stephen Miller.","Stephen Miller is the reigning UK cyber security champion .

"(CNN) -- In recent days, with the tiniest poke of a toe in the political waters -- a few comments to news organizations about the recent Supreme Court ruling on President Barack Obama's health care law -- former Rep. Anthony Weiner has set off a frenzy of speculation that he may be planning to run for mayor of New York in 2013. At first glance, a second political act for Weiner might seem impossible. It was a little more than a year ago that the liberal Democrat crashed and burned on national television, tearfully resigning after right-wing bloggers exposed his bizarre habit of sending raunchy photos and messages to strangers. But he's being taken seriously in New York political circles -- an acknowledgment of his considerable energy and talent for championing middle-class values, and a testament to the city's habit of tolerating and rehabilitating fallen pols. On Wednesday night, when asked in an interview with People magazine whether he is considering a bid for mayor, Weiner said he is not planning a campaign -- but he didn't rule out a run for political office in the future. It was June 2011 when comedians of late-night TV were feasting on Weiner's misery. Conservatives crowed over the scalp they'd claimed -- and were ecstatic when a Republican won the special election to replace Weiner. A few months later, with no longtime incumbent to protect the seat, Weiner's district was eliminated altogether when population changes required New York state to reduce the size of its congressional delegation. That appeared to be the final chapter in Weiner's political career. He claims to have no plans beyond caring for his newborn son and insists that recent news stories are simply wrong. But that's not the end of the story to those of us who have been watching Weiner since the days when, at age 27, he became the youngest member of the New York City Council. Although known across the nation as a left-wing firebrand, Weiner has had a profile in New York as a pragmatic, centrist Democrat willing to break from the city's liberal orthodoxy. In 2005, when Weiner made a first run for mayor, he publicly castigated the eventual Democratic nominee for proposing the re-imposition of a local tax on every stock trade to raise money from Wall Street (a favorite but unworkable liberal plan). Weiner often railed against the rising cost of living for his financially squeezed constituents (45% of whom voted for John McCain in 2008) and co-founded a bipartisan Middle Class Caucus in Congress. As the third and final term of Mayor Michael Bloomberg winds down, the field of Democrats running to succeed him lacks a candidate with Weiner's loud, laserlike focus on middle-class issues. That absence has political insiders wondering if there might be room at the table for Weiner. Even more tantalizing is Weiner's $4.5 million political war chest that would, if activated, qualify him for $1.5 million in public matching funds and land him near the city's $6.7 million campaign spending cap. That makes him one of the best-funded mayoral candidates in New York, and more than just the punch line of a joke. As for the ick factor -- the creepy cause of Weiner's resignation -- he might end up benefiting from the wide latitude New Yorkers tend to allow public figures when it comes to their personal lives. Back in the 1920s, one of New York's most flamboyant and corrupt mayors, Jimmy Walker was married but carried on affairs with women who frequented the speak-easies that flourished in the city during his tenure. Walker eventually left his wife to run off with a ""chorus girl"" he later married, but the carousing didn't stop him from getting re-elected in 1929 (when he defeated none other than Fiorello LaGuardia). Fast-forward to modern times when Mayor Rudy Giuliani used a press conference to announce plans to separate from his second wife -- who apparently learned of his intentions from news reports -- and tried to have her kicked out of Gracie Mansion, the official mayoral residence, so that his new girlfriend could move in. Giuliani eventually straightened out his personal life: He got a divorce and girlfriend Judith Nathan became wife No. 3. New Yorkers more or less shrugged. Even ex-Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who resigned after admitting to hiring prostitutes, has returned to public life, hosting a nightly show on Current TV and recently offering weekly commentary alongside other ex-officials on the New York political TV show ""Inside City Hall."" As host of the show, I have received exactly one complaint to date. Many New Yorkers -- admittedly, not all -- treat politicians the way they would a plumber or auto repairman: If you've hired the guy to unclog your sink or fix the brakes, he should be judged on that performance, and what goes on in his personal life should remain between him and his wife. In fact, according to a NY1/Marist College poll, a majority of Weiner's congressional constituents thought he should not have resigned after the sexting scandal. The biggest hurdle Weiner has to clear is the dishonest way he handled the early stages of the scandal. As the salacious photos emerged and the blogosphere exploded, Weiner unwisely had his office ring up various press outlets and went from one show to another, offering blatant lies and denials about how photos of his privates ended up on Facebook and Twitter. That left a bad taste in the mouths of reporters, producers and editors. As the New York Daily News editorial board notes: ""Weiner's sexual escapades were, in fact, the least of his sins. He proved to be a stone-cold liar as he tried to save his skin."" If it's true that, as Weiner insists, he had no physical contact with the women to whom he sent raunchy messages, he will likely get as least as much latitude as Giuliani and Spitzer. And if Weiner has the support of his family -- and is prepared to make a full apology for the lying -- he can eventually expect to find his way back into some form of public service.

"(CNN) -- A plane crash Tuesday killed six public servants working for Mexico's attorney general's office, officials said. The crash in Zacatecas state occurred a day after the authorities onboard had carried out an arrest warrant against several suspected members of the Zetas cartel, Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said in a statement. Authorities are investigating what caused the crash of the plane, which belonged to his office, Murillo Karam said. The plane did not return to Mexico City as scheduled on Monday due to mechanical problems, he said. Instead, the plane headed back to Mexico City at noon Tuesday. It crashed 10 minutes after takeoff, Murillo Karam said. Two federal police agents and an agent working for the organized crime investigation branch of the attorney general's office were among the casualties. The plane's pilot, co-pilot and a mechanic also were killed. CNN's Rene Hernandez and Catherine E.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan faces new criminal charges in California, filed just hours after the actress was arrested in New York in connection with an alleged early morning fight at a nightclub. Lohan's latest legal troubles could send her back to jail because she is on probation for a necklace theft conviction. Lohan's convoluted path through the criminal courts system and her struggle with drugs and alcohol has taken her to court 19 times and to five rehab facilities for a total of 250 days since January 2007. Lohan, 26, was arrested at a Manhattan nightclub after an alleged fight about 4 a.m. Thursday, the New York Police Department said. Lohan may have hit another woman at the Avenue Lounge, police said. Authorities declined to say whether she faced charges. ""Once again, Lindsay Lohan is a victim of someone trying to capture their 15 minutes of fame,"" Lohan's New York lawyer, Mark Heller, told CNN. ""From my initial investigation, I am completely confident that this case will be concluded favorably and that Lindsay will be totally exonerated."" 'Liz & Dick' producer talks the risky business of hiring Lindsay Lohan . Across the country in Santa Monica, California, the city attorney filed four charges against Lohan Thursday morning in connection with a car crash last summer. She is accused of giving false information to a police officer, obstructing or resisting a police officer in performance of his duty and reckless driving, according to the city attorney's office. While these charges are all misdemeanors and would not alone normally result in jail time, the Los Angeles city attorney, who successfully prosecuted the actress for stealing a necklace in 2011, could ask a judge to revoke her probation. A decision by the Los Angeles city attorney could come as soon as Friday, spokesman Frank Mateljan said. While it would likely be several days before the prosecutor gets confirmation of Lohan's New York arrest, the Santa Monica charges filed Thursday should reach the Los Angeles city attorney's office sooner. The timing of a decision on seeking a revocation of Lohan's probation for the shoplifting conviction depends on the workload in the prosecutor's office, Mateljan said. The Santa Monica charges stem from a car crash last June while Lohan was on her way to the set for the filming of ""Liz & Dick,"" the Lifetime movie that aired this week. She is accused of telling police her assistant was driving the Porsche, while witnesses told investigators they saw Lohan behind the wheel. ""During the subsequent investigation, information was developed that Lohan was the driver of the Porsche when the accident occurred,"" the Santa Monica prosecutor said in a statement to CNN.

"(CNN) -- Amanda Sedgmer, mother of five and daughter of coal country, believes that in this presidential election, her way of life is at stake. ""If you ask anybody in the coal industry what would happen if Obama is re-elected, they'd say the coal industry is done,"" said Sedgmer, whose husband, Ryan, is a coal miner and whose family has depended on the industry for at least four generations. Sedgmer lives in Hopedale, Ohio, which sits on top of one of the state's richest coal deposits. For nearly a century here, mining has been one of the few professions guaranteeing a good and consistent salary. Read Sedgmer's original story on CNN iReport . But in the past two years, an increasing number of coal-powered electricity plants across the country have announced closures. Estimates vary, but banking and industry analysis firm Credit Suisse put expected and known closures for 2009-2012 at 111 plants, that's one-fifth of the nation's nearly 500 coal plants. There are two main factors in the demise of those plants. First, the price of coal's competitor, natural gas, is decreasing. At the same time, a new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency is pushing the price of coal up. That change, called the Maximum Achievable Control Technology, or MACT, rule requires that coal- and oil-fired power plants reduce pollutant emission rates significantly. The rule, which operates under the Clean Air Act, does not stipulate a lower level of carbon output. But by requiring lower mercury and other toxic emissions, it would reduce carbon as well. Coal mining families aren't the only ones facing shifts in industry . The EPA estimates this will result in some 1% of national electricity capacity shutting down, and a cost increase of about 3.7% in retail electricity. But those in coal country give much higher estimates. They believe if President Obama stays in office and the rule continues, it will mean the end of their industry. ""If coal fell, which is one of the main sources of employment around this area, everything would suffer,"" Sedgmer said while sitting on her front porch. ""There'd be no funding for the schools, which are already suffering. I can't see how destroying one industry benefits anything."" The job is a source of income for the family and pride for Ryan. ""I like it,"" the 30-year-old said. ""I enjoy doing it. ... It's provided for our family. We have a big family and we haven't had to worry about too much."" Watch behind-the-scenes interview with Sedgmer . The Sedgmers have invested a lot in their home in Hopedale, which is next to the towns where Ryan and Amanda grew up. When another mining job moved the family away, the Sedgmers rented out the 100-year-old home, keeping a foothold in their community. Thanks to a new mining job, two weeks ago the Sedgmers moved back to the area. They put up a ""Home Sweet Home"" sign in the kitchen. They want to stay. ""If all coal mines shut down,"" Amanda Sedgmer paused, ""we would struggle ... we would definitely lose our house. "" Sedgmer voted for President Obama in 2008 and she is not a particular fan of Mitt Romney, but she's voting for the Republican because she believes he is the only chance the coal industry and her community have to survive. Romney hopes all this concern helps him in the Buckeye swing state and in other coal communities. He has told crowds at campaign speeches that President Obama ""sure doesn't like coal."" The president has vigorously disagreed, saying he is for ""clean coal."" Environmentalists believe the EPA rule and the increasing closures of coal plants are breakthroughs that are overdue and will do dramatic good. Les Brown, the president of the Earth Policy Institute, points to studies that coal emissions, including mercury and other pollutants, cause more than 10,000 deaths a year. ""It's a war for survival,"" Brown said, sitting in a Washington office filled with piles of reports and papers about the environment. ""Saving lives, not just a handful of lives, but thousands of lives. But more broadly, saving the planet."" Would he like to see all coal plants closed? ""Yes,"" Brown responded, ""It would be cleaner, it would be safer and it would help stabilize the climate, which is the big threat to our future. I mean it's even difficult to put a price tag on that."" Brown sees the problems with coal and climate change as a very human issue that could lead to droughts in some places, including the American Midwest, and floods in other places, like the American coasts. In either case, Brown fears loss of crops, homes and lives. But the same issue is personal to Amanda Sedgmer. Every day as Ryan prepares to go underground, he checks a bulletin board listing the latest coal closures. The Sedgmers' five children are still young, aged 16 months to 10 years. Those old enough to speak already talk about coal. When asked what he wants to do when he grows up, 4-year-old Ben Sedgmer blurts out, ""Coal miner!"" But his parents don't know if there will be many, or any, coal mining jobs waiting for him in Hopedale when he's old enough. For both sides, the war over coal is personal.

"Washington (CNN) -- Behind-the-scenes dealing over reviving stalled gun control legislation will get a push next week when Sen. Joe Manchin, a strong proponent of expanding background checks, plans to meet individually with lawmakers, a Senate source tells CNN. The key question the conservative West Virginia Democrat wants answered is whether a ""minimal change"" to a compromise background check proposal that he co-authored but which failed to gain enough support in a vote last month would entice more senators to support it, the source said. Since the proposal he negotiated with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania faltered, senators who voted against it have been hounded in their states during the current recess by outside proponents of expanding background checks. Sen. Kelly Ayotte has been the most high-profile target of such confrontations. The New Hampshire Republican was questioned at an event by Erica Lafferty, the daughter of Dawn Hochsprung, a school principal slain in the Newtown massacre last December. Lafferty asked ""why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the halls of her elementary school isn't as important"" as inconveniencing gun sellers. Lafferty was sent to Ayotte's event by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, one of several gun control groups using the current congressional recess to take the gun control message out of Washington. And she followed that up with interviews with TV networks. The source said this sort of pressure from outside groups is a key to any hopes of swaying senators who may be open to supporting a modified proposal. In addition to confronting senators in person, groups have run ads against lawmakers who voted against the Toomey-Manchin compromise and have supported senators who supported it. The husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting in Arizona, wrote an opinion piece in the Houston Chronicle challenging the National Rifle Association over its opposition to expanded background checks. ""What most members of the NRA want from the organization and what the leadership is actually doing are not the same,"" Mark Kelly wrote. Thousands of NRA members are gathered in Houston this weekend for its annual convention. According to the Senate source, the pressure tactics appear to be working with polls showing most Americans favoring some sort of new gun restrictions. The signal Manchin has been getting from senators getting hammered at home, according to the source, is that they need to save face politically and any deal would hinge on whether they can argue that they extracted something new in the language. ""We have to figure out some sort of new sentence, one change to it so they can go back and say 'I fought to change this,'"" said the source. At this point, however, it is not clear what the change would be. In order to pass any legislation around the issue, gun control advocates need find 60 votes in the Senate. Fifty-four senators backed the Mancin-Toomey amendment while 46 opposed it. Majority Leader Harry Reid supported it but only voted 'no' in the end on procedural grounds to keep open the possibility of revisiting it later. The Senate source says Manchin's prime targets to flip are all Republicans and similar to those under pressure from outside groups: Ayotte, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada. According to the source, proponents hope that if Murkowski flips, those in favor of tightening gun laws will have a good shot at getting her fellow Alaskan, Sen. Mark Begich, to do the same. But a source close to Begich, however, told CNN that it is very unlikely that he'd change his vote. He is up for reelection in 2014 in a state that is very pro-gun. The NRA is likely to be a power that looms large over any deal on background checks, much like it was during the last debate. After the compromise background check proposal failed, the NRA Institute for Legislative Action released a statement decrying the ""misguided"" amendment that, it said, would ""not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools."" ""This amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution,"" the NRA said. Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, made it clear on Friday that his organization would not budge on guns. ""All over this country, everywhere I go, people agree, they want bad guys taken off the streets and they want children protected in their schools,"" he said. ""And they don't' want their freedom taken away."" In addition to LaPierre, several potential contenders for the 2016 GOP nomination will take the stage in Houston, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin spoke to the group as well. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, asked by one of the other victims of the Giffords shooting if he thought background checks would come up again, said there was a ""50-50"" chance that it would. A spokeswoman for Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, one of the more high-profile Democrats to vote against the provision, told CNN that if such a bill were to come up, ""Max will evaluate it based on the feedback he gathers from the people of Montana, just as he always does with any legislation."" But she also said that in his first vote, ""Montanans told Max loud and clear they didn't support new gun controls in the previous bill.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- At 107, Frank Buckles must know there is not much time for him to honor the memory of his comrades who served the United States during the first World War. He's the last surviving U.S. veteran of what then was called the Great War. Frank Buckles is 107 years old and the last surviving U.S. veteran of World War I. The old soldier came to Washington on Tuesday hoping to turn a run-down local memorial on the National Mall into something in keeping with other, permanent monuments to Americans who've sacrificed in other wars. He's getting help from a Texas congressman who said he found the condition of the site deplorable. At a news conference with Buckles on Tuesday, Rep. Ted Poe said he has introduced the ""Frank Buckles World War I Act"" to renovate and expand the memorial within the next few years. Poe, a Republican, said his bill would ""give this memorial energy, and will be incorporated in a grander, better memorial for all that served in World War I."" The price of the initial renovations would be around $1 million, Poe said, and the site eventually would be upgraded to a national memorial, though design details haven't been determined. The memorial is currently not national, having been built primarily to honor about 500 veterans from the District of Columbia. Buckles, who left the Army as a corporal, first visited the gazebo-style structure in March. He told reporters Tuesday that he does not think it's too late to acknowledge the sacrifice of all Americans from that war. ""I think they should be honored by their representatives,"" Buckles said from his wheelchair. ""I am a representative of World War I, simply through longevity."" Also pushing the overhaul and upgrade are the D.C. Preservation League and the World War I Memorial Foundation. The site of the current monument -- in dense woods not far from the fresh and elaborate World War II memorial -- is hard to find, even in the dead of winter, when Buckles last visited. ""We just saw it through the trees,"" tourist Regina Duffy said in March. ""I was surprised when we got over here that it was a World War I memorial, because I thought it would be more prominent."" With summer foliage fully in bloom, the city's monument is almost completely obscured. Zeke Musa of Florida said it ""looks like it's been neglected."" ""If you just look at the walks here, all the stones are broken and everything. These guys served their country, you know? It's a shame,"" said Musa, a Vietnam veteran. According to an autobiography released this year by the Pentagon, Buckles was eager to join the war. Although only 16 in the summer of 1917, he lied about his age to get into the armed services. He said his recruiter told him ""the Ambulance Service was the quickest way to get to France,"" so he took training in trench casualty retrieval. Buckles was an officer's escort in France before joining a detail transporting German prisoners of war. He now lives on his family's cattle farm near Charles Town, West Virginia.","NEW: Bill would renovate, expand memorial .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Attention single ladies! Comedian Steve Harvey, the best-selling author of ""Act Like a Lady, Think Like Man"" and a self-professed expert on manhood, is here to take you inside the male mind. Comedian Steve Harvey says real men like to provide and protect, but some also like to cheat. Whether you're looking for Mr. Right or trying to forget Mr. Wrong, Steve isn't holding anything back. Many women have long lists that describe what they're looking for in a man...but are their standards simply too high? Yinka and Lynell are two 30-something friends who have long lists. They're here to ask Steve if they'll ever find a man who meets all their requirements. Lynell says she's looking for a God-fearing, spontaneous African-American millionaire with straight teeth and nice shoes who wants children...among other things. ""That would be the Lord,"" Steve jokes. ""I'll be trying to meet him the same time you do."" If a woman is serious about her list, Steve says she should ask herself one question before turning down a date. ""Are you willing to be the same thing to him that you're talking about on that list?"" he says. ""A lot of women are not."" In general, do women even need a list? Steve says single ladies do need to set standards. ""I think lists are great. You've got to have them. You've got to know what you're looking for,"" he says. ""Without standards, you settle for stuff."" Before you get discouraged, Steve reminds women to stay patient and remember that real men aren't afraid of standards and requirements. ""You've got to wait on this guy to come along. He's coming. He's out there. He's already created. God has already made him,"" he says. ""He has a job. He's wearing the clothes you like. He's walking around. You're not waiting on him to be born. He exists today. All you've got to do is stay patient."" Why do many successful, independent women have a hard time finding love? There are millions of smart, beautiful women around the world who can't figure out why they're unlucky in love, including a group of friends from New York. Steve is here to set them straight. Steve says many successful women dated good men but didn't know it at the time. ""You don't know the DNA of a good man,"" he says. Even if you look like a million bucks -- and you have a few million in the bank -- Steve says a woman needs to know how a man shows his love. It's all about the ""three P's."" Oprah.com: Can a list help you find love? ""We profess, we provide and we protect,"" he says. ""A man has got to see where he fits into the providing and protecting role. If you've got everything, you can do everything, you've got your own car ... you've got a guard dog and a handgun. The guy is thinking, 'Where do I fit in here?' ""You've got to make a space for him to fit in so he can come in and do what men do."" Steve doesn't advise women to downplay their success or pack up their designer shoes. Instead, he says strong women have to walk a thin line. ""You can't let your independence and your ability to take care of yourself be the dominant factor of who you are,"" he says. ""You know how many times I hear women say: 'I don't need a man. I've got this. Why don't a man just come to me?' Just like you're saying it, you're projecting it. If you're projecting it, where does a man fit in there? Just relax."" Oprah.com: How to act like a lady, think like a man . After a few dates, some guys just stop returning calls and texts. Even if they aren't interested, don't they want closure? Steve has a simple answer to this question...no. ""Ladies, you're not going to get closure from a man,"" he says. ""We don't do closure. And you know why? Because we don't even know you're having an issue. We're stupid."" If you're hoping for a courtesy call, Steve says you can forget about that too. ""We're not courteous. Listen, it's not in our DNA as great communicators anyway,"" he says. ""See women keep waiting on closure. Bring it on. If you want closure, close. Move on with your life."" How important is sex in a relationship? Sex, or ""the cookie"" as Steve calls it in his book, is a major point of contention for many couples. If you don't think it's important to your man, Steve says you're wrong. ""It's critical,"" he says. ""It's one of the three things that a man has to have. A man has to have love, support and the cookie. [If] anyone of those three things is missing in the relationship, he's going to go get it somewhere else."" If a man is cheating or has the intention to cheat, why pursue commitment with one woman? Michele found out her boyfriend of many years was cheating after he told her he was ready to settle down and get married. The male mind may be a mystery to women, but Steve says there's a simple explanation for this behavior. ""A man having sex outside of his relationship is very different from [a woman],"" he says. ""Once we shower and wash off, we cool. ""Please know that about a man. If he's going to cheat, it has nothing to do with his emotional attachment to you or his feelings for you."" Steve says cheaters make promises to their significant others because they know that's what women want to hear. ""Michele, there's nothing wrong with you. You haven't done anything,"" he says. ""Please release yourself. Let the baggage go."" Sadly, many women have dated men who cheat...and most of them don't even know it. Steve says there are a few major reasons why men stray, though none of them excuse the behavior. The top 5 reasons: . • They can . • They think they can get away with it . • The man hasn't become who he wants and needs to be or found who he truly wants to be with. • What's happening at home isn't ""happening"" like it used to. • There's always a woman out there willing to cheat with him. If you're married to a mama's boy, is there anything a wife can do to become the number one woman in his life? Before Jill married her husband of 13 years, she says she knew he was a mama's boy. Over the years, she's grown tired of coming in second. Steve says the first mistake women like Jill make is thinking they can change their men. ""You think if you give him enough cookie, bake it just right, he'll straighten up,"" he says. ""That's not what happens with a mama's boy."" Men stay in this adolescent mind-set because their mothers set standards when they were boys and upheld those standards throughout their lives, Steve says. Wives must enter into their marriages with their own set of rules to stand a chance. Oprah.com: Get more of Steve's love advice! ""You have to start saying: 'Hey, look, you have to respect me. You have to be here to show your son how a man treats a woman. You have to be here to show your daughter how a man should treat her,'"" he says. ""'You can't do it if you're playing me second to your mama.'"" If that doesn't work, Steve suggests appealing to the ""three Ps"" -- profess, provide and protect. ""If you don't say to your man: 'Okay, look, next time she calls, do not leave us in the middle of the night. We're unprotected,'"" he says. ""Every man has it in his DNA to do these things when we love you. When you call on it and require it, we rise to the occasion."" From The Oprah Winfrey Show  © 2008 .

"(CNN) -- A Lion Air flight carrying about 100 people ended up in the Indian Ocean while attempting to land at Bali International Airport on Saturday, officials said. Only one person was immediately confirmed as having suffered injuries, Lion Air spokesman Edward Sirait said at a news conference in Jakarta following the incident. Eighteen people were taken to the hospital to be checked over, Sirait said. The airline, which operates under the official name Lion Mentari, was already banned from European airspace due to safety concerns, according to the European Union. The plane, a Boeing 737-800, has only been in use by Lion Air since March, Sirait said. Sirait said the plane is a new one and that the pilot was fit to fly. Lion Air crew can fly a maximum of eight hours per day, he said. iReporter captures images of crash aftermath . The plane had flown earlier in the day from Palu, Central Sulawesi, to Banjarmasin, Kalimantan; it then proceeded to Bandung and then Bali, Sirait said. It's not clear whether the same pilot was flying the aircraft the entire time. Doug Sovern, of KCBS Radio in San Francisco, was at the airport when the incident happened. He described seeing the plane, with a big crack splitting the fuselage in two, off the end of the runway in the Indian Ocean. ""Amazingly they were able to get everyone out of the plane,"" he told KCBS Radio, adding that he didn't see any rescue chutes. ""We saw a lot of fire engines and ambulances. We were told there were some minor injuries,"" he said. The plane appeared to be more than 100 feet out into the ocean, he said, but it wasn't too far for people to get back to land. The fuselage now seems to be sinking into the water, he said. At first people feared the worst, he added, but it now seems the passengers and crew have had a fairly miraculous escape -- with shades of the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" in New York. In that 2009 incident, Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger was forced to make an emergency landing on the Hudson River after his Airbus A320 collided with a flock of geese and lost thrust 2,700 feet over Manhattan. Everyone was rescued. In late 2011, Boeing made its largest single aviation sale -- 230 planes totaling $21.7 billion -- to Lion Air, a domestic airline virtually unknown outside of the archipelago nation of 6,000 inhabited islands. CNN's Per Nyberg, Jacque Wilson, and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: Lion Air is banned from European airspace .

"(CNN) -- Several years ago, when my husband and I went to collect our newly adopted cat after surgery, the vet receptionist picked up the phone and languidly informed whoever was at the other end: ""Minou's mommy and daddy are here to pick her up."" Wow. Apparently I had a baby. A furry one, currently stapled together with a cone on its head. There are various types of pet owners. At one end of the spectrum is the ""no nonsense"" variety who believe the lines between beast and human are far too often blurred. At the other extreme are those whose pet is categorically their baby. And then there's everyone in between. For many, consciously or otherwise, a pet is a practice child, a step up in responsibility between none and a lot. Something to love and take care of, but that you can leave alone when you go out for dinner without fear that it will die. This is perhaps why so frequently the horse (dog, cat, or chinchilla) comes before the (baby) carriage. But what happens to your ""pet baby"" when it comes time for a real human child to join your family? Our baby is due in July, and despite my occasional fantasies that the cat won't notice, I know that in reality she will, and I don't think she will like it. The cat sleeps in our bed, commands attention whenever she desires, and doesn't have to share her living space with anything of a remotely similar size. Dr. Heather Thomson, from Manhattan's West Village Vet, says that more than 50% of the practice's clients who have a new baby find their pets are stressed, nervous and upset by it. No wonder. When a pet is used to being the baby, it can be disconcerting to suddenly have to compete with what appears to be a tiny, yelling object vying for the spotlight. ""They were our kids,"" says Caroline Krediet of dogs Hector and Lemon prior to their baby's arrival. ""We arranged weekend outings around them, indulged them. Put their needs first at all times, almost."" The same was true for Lauren Crandall before her son came along. ""It was all about E.G., all the time,"" she says of their rescue Havanese, ""He was a first thought always."" However you see your pet -- baby, miscellaneous family member, friend, possession, colleague, animated stuffed animal -- chances are that it thinks of itself as the creamy filling to your Oreo and won't enjoy being usurped by a screaming upstart. ""The dynamic changes,"" Thomson explains, ""and the pet realizes it's no longer the center of the universe."" No matter how you slice it, babies -- especially newborns -- demand a huge amount of time, attention and energy, often leaving a deficit for your furry friend. ""I think E.G. was depressed for a while,"" says Crandall, ""The first four months were the hardest. He wasn't getting out as much as he used to and wasn't getting the same amount of attention during the day. I felt really badly for him."" Problems adapting to your bundle of joy can range in pets from mild to severe. ""A cat can withdraw, stop eating, develop a medical problem, deviate from normal cat habits -- urinate or defecate outside of box, become destructive, anorexic, aggressive,"" says cat therapist Carole Wilbourn, adding that a very anxious cat could even attack the baby or other family members. Thomson says dogs can also become more aggressive, often in a misguided attempt to protect the baby. Our cat is fairly neurotic -- a kind of cat version of, perhaps, Woody Allen -- and is not a huge fan of any kind of change, no matter how minute. Thus our goal has been to arm ourselves with as much information as possible on smoothing the transition at home from pet palace to nursery. We hope this will help us avoid a kitty mental breakdown. There's a lot of advice out there for pet owners with similar concerns. Thomson says bringing a used baby blanket home from the hospital prior to the baby's arrival can help your pet become accustomed to the scent. She says some pet owners have also used plug-in pheromone diffusers, which can help to calm animals during the period of transition. Wilbourn suggests a multifaceted approach with cats, including a lot of feeding, petting, name-crooning and general attention around the time that cat and baby meet. She also recommends desensitizing the (poor) cat by playing a recording of a baby crying, and perhaps having a friend's child come over to play so the cat gets used to kids, and presumably is then less prone to a full blown freakout when sticky hands grab its tail. She details more approaches in her book, ""The Complete Guide to Understanding and Caring for Your Cat."" Krediet said when they bought their daughter home from the hospital, they let the dogs sniff her feet and get to know her, making sure never to leave them with her unsupervised. Crandall, meanwhile, sums up their approach as ""NDLB"" (no dog left behind). ""We call him our firstborn son and he is the baby's brother,"" she says, ""We try really hard to make him feel special and not that he has been sidelined."" But in case you were wondering if the upshot of all of this is a Disneyesque house of harmony where pet and baby frolic and snuggle in happy unison, you may be asking too much. While mini-Crandall is becoming increasingly fascinated by the furry creature sharing his home, Crandall says dog E.G. -- while tolerant -- does not return the interest level. ""He sniffs him and then goes about his business."" Lack of interest, however, is still one of the better outcomes. Some pets never come around to the change in circumstances. Wilbourn says it can be a good idea to arrange a ""worst-case scenario,"" alternative home for your pet, in case all else fails. But there are some happy endings. Wilbourn describes one cat who, after an initial show of aggressive behavior, became devoted to the new baby and now acts as a kind of ""cat nanny,"" standing guard over its little friend, maybe wearing a pinafore (that part possibly is just in my imagination). And according to Krediet, Hector and Lemon's affections have increased exponentially along with the baby's propensity to drop food on the floor. Hector now even lets her ride on his back. ""I think they adapted to the situation the same way we adapted our lives, going from crazy, freedom-loving 20s into responsible married 30s,"" she says, ""I think they've enjoyed parenthood, too.""

"Editor's note: Clark Howard, the Atlanta-based host of a nationally syndicated radio show, hosts a new television show designed to help viewers save more, spend less and avoid getting ripped off during these tough economic times. The show airs Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m., noon and 4 p.m. ET. Clark Howard says to buy smart in this ""buyer's market of all times."" ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Cars are such a deal right now that you might feel you are stealing when you buy one. Dealers have no customers, regardless of the price point, brand, style or size. Americans are afraid to buy because of the scary headlines and the times we are in right now. You add in the fact that a lot of us can't qualify for loans -- and even many who can are worried that they are going to lose their jobs -- and that cuts the car market down to almost nonexistent. Add in the fact that manufacturers kept making cars in the fall when there were already no buyers, and that makes this the buyer's market of all time. I can prove it. Carmakers like to have a 60-day supply of cars on hand. That means if they stopped making them today, it would take 60 days to sell off all they have. That gives them enough out there to, in theory, get you the color, style and options that you would want almost right away. Today, many companies have 90 to 140 days of cars on hand -- far, far too many. Even Honda and Toyota, which have set the world on fire in recent years, have seen sales decline 30 percent or more year-over-year. Add in the fact that nobody is buying, and as you might expect, you can buy almost anything you want at a fantastic deal. If you are one of the rare souls out there who can actually buy a car now, I have simple steps to get you a great deal. First things first: Get the money. Whether you are buying new or used, go qualify for a loan first at your bank or credit union. Credit unions and online banks tend to write car loans at about 1.5 percent lower than a traditional bank. For example, the credit union I am a member of is writing car loans for 3.90 percent right now. When you get ready to contact a dealer, don't discuss that you have a loan already arranged and never, never, never tell a car dealer that you are going to pay cash, even if you are. If they know, they will not give you as good a deal on the car because they can't count on making money on your loan. (If the dealer can match the loan you have found elsewhere, it is fine to get the loan from the dealer). Second, go read the April issue of Consumer Reports magazine. It starts circulating in March and is devoted 100 percent to car buying. You will be able to see what cars have proved to be reliable and which ones are prone to make you know your repair shop people on a first-name basis. I won't consider a new or used car if Consumer Reports shows it to be unreliable. If you want to buy a car this month or in early March before the April 2009 issue is out, go to the library and use last April's issue as a guide. Third, once you have a new car or cars in mind, find your choices on edmunds.com to learn their current TMV, or true market value. Then go to carsdirect.com to get a fixed price for each model equipped the way you like. You can buy from carsdirect or use it as a guide to what price you want to beat. Also, Costco, Sam's and BJ's Wholesale offer fixed-price car buying programs. Members should just go to the stores' Web sites, where you will be able to get a referral to the dealer handling the brand you are interested in. Some AAAs and some credit unions offer car buying services as well. The price you get is the real price, no games, no gimmicks. You can also e-mail dealers for price quotes. I recommend that you take any or all of these steps before ever stepping onto a dealer lot. That way, you are getting your price or playing one dealer off against another from your own home or office. You don't have a chance to get a good deal if you drive to the dealer to negotiate. Speaking of games and gimmicks: My wife was interested in buying a Toyota Prius. They had been in high demand this summer when gas prices were over $4 a gallon, but demand has collapsed because gas prices have fallen and because people in the know are waiting for the third-generation Prius due out in a few months. She saw a newspaper ad for a new 2009 Prius at around $5,000 less than last summer. She e-mailed the Internet salesperson at the dealership and asked a very important question: What other charges were there in addition to the advertised price? As often happens with car dealers, the advertised price was fiction. The dealer charges a $595 paperwork fee, known as a doc fee, (total garbage) and a mandatory $895 charge for exterior wax and interior fabric guard (also garbage). If she had not e-mailed the dealer and had just gone in, it would have been a wasted trip as the newspaper ad was just classic ""bait and switch."" The only thing I want you to do at the dealership is sign the papers and pay. ALWAYS negotiate in advance on your home turf. But what about a test drive? You learn very little on a 10-minute test drive at a car dealer. I recommend that you rent the car you think you want on the weekend from an airport car rental agency or from an Enterprise office in town. Car rentals are dirt cheap on the weekends, and getting two days to really put a car that you think you want to own through its paces can help you decide whether to buy it or write it off your list. I discovered this by accident in the '80s on a trip to San Diego, California. There was a car I really wanted to buy, and just by chance, I had it assigned to me at the car rental. I drove it for three days. It was an awful car, but I never would have known that from just a short dealer test drive. When to talk about your trade-in . Never discuss your trade-in until after you have secured your loan, and have agreed to a price for the car you are buying. Know in advance what your trade-in might be worth by checking values on kbb.com, edmunds.com and nada.com. You should also look at autotrader.com to see what people are trying to sell your vehicle for. And if one is in your area, visit CarMax to see how much your car is selling for. That helps let you know whether the dealer is giving you a fair amount for your old car. If you can't scare up a good enough offer, you can try to sell your car yourself. You will generally clear from $1,000 to $1,500 more selling yourself, but it is no picnic.  Watch how to avoid buying damaged used car » . In a future commentary, I will give you the steps to buying a used car. In most cases, you get far more for your money used vs. new. But whether you buy new or used, follow my guide, and not only will I save you tons of money, but you won't need store-brand pain reliever for the headaches most people get buying a car.","Clark Howard says this is the buyer's market of all time for new cars .

"(CNN) -- ""We will finish the race."" That's the simple but resilient statement framed by dozens of running shoes forming the shape of a heart on the cover of Boston Magazine's May cover. Design director Brian Struble and deputy design director Liz Noftle came up with the idea on April 15, the night after the Boston Marathon bombing shook the city -- and nation -- just a few blocks away from the magazine's offices near Copley Square. The staff decided to scrap the magazine's previously planned May cover, and with the new concept in hand utilized social media and personal connections to ask runners who took part in the marathon for their shoes. With each pair of shoes came a story, which the staff packaged into a feature called ""The Shoes We Wore."" Only 15 stories would fit in the print issue; the rest will live online. ""Every pair became precious,"" said editor-in-chief John Wolfson. On Thursday, Struble packed his car with 120 pairs of colorful sneakers and drove to New York so photographer Mitchell Feinberg could bring the concept to life. ""Everyone on staff came together to make this happen,"" Noftle told CNN's Jake Tapper and Brooke Baldwin. Wolfson explained on the magazine's website that the cover is about ""perseverance and unity."" ""By itself, each shoe in the photograph is tiny, battered, and ordinary. Together, though, they create something beautiful, powerful, and inspirational,"" he said. ""Remove just one shoe and you begin to diminish, in some small way, the overall effect. Collectively, they are the perfect symbol for Boston, and for our response to the bombings."" Each person who donated shoes for the project will get them back, Noftle said. As for the project's overall message: ""It just represents that we're a strong city,"" Noftle added.","Boston Magazine staff scrapped its planned cover in the wake of the marathon bombings .

"(CNN) -- As one bombing suspect recovers in a prison hospital and cemeteries reject the body of the other, a whirlwind of new developments are swirling around the investigation into the Boston Marathon bombings. Here are five major developments that took place over the weekend and what's expected to happen next in the case: . 1. One suspect appears in court . One of the three friends accused of helping Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the younger of the two suspects, cover up his alleged crime is due in court for a bail hearing Monday. Robel Phillipos, 19, is accused of making false statements to federal investigators during a terrorism investigation. If convicted, he could go to prison for eight years and be fined as much as $250,000. Phillipos and two mutual friends met at Tsarnaev's dorm room the night authorities released photos of the bombing suspects, according to an FBI affidavit. Tsarnaev texted one of the friends, saying he could ""come to my room and take whatever you want."" Tsarnaev wasn't in his dorm room, but his roommate let the friends in. Phillipos first denied to investigators ever going to the dorm room, then later changed his story, the affidavit states. While watching a movie, one or more of the friends spotted a backpack, according to the statement. Inside, Phillipos noticed about seven tubular fireworks, each between 6 and 8 inches long. The fireworks' powder had been taken out. The three friends left with the backpack and laptop, the FBI affidavit states. The backpack was thrown in a trash bin and ended up in a New Bedford landfill, only to be found six days later. FBI: How Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's friends took, trashed key pieces of evidence . 2. Cemeteries don't want to bury Tamerlan Tsarnaev . For two weeks, no one claimed the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the elder bombing suspect who died the night he and his brother led police on a wild chase. Now, the funeral home holding his remains is struggling to find a place to bury him. The brothers' parents in Dagestan have said they will not fly his body back to Russia for burial, spokeswoman Heda Saratova said. And Cambridge City Manager Robert W. Healy said he would not allow Tsarnaev to be buried in the city if requested by the funeral director or Tsarnaev's family. ""The difficult and stressful efforts of the citizens of the City of Cambridge to return to a peaceful life would be adversely impacted by the turmoil, protests, and widespread media presence at such an interment,"" Healy said in a statement Sunday. Explaining his decision, he cited an excerpt from Massachusetts state law saying that ""it shall be the duty of the city manager to act as chief conservator of the peace within the city."" ""I have determined that it is not in the best interest of 'peace within the city' to execute a cemetery deed for a plot within the Cambridge Cemetery for the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev,"" Healy said. Tsarnaev's body now lies at Graham Putnam & Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester, west of Boston. Peter Stefan, owner of the funeral home, said three cemeteries he's contacted said they feared reprisals. If he can't find a gravesite, Stefan said he plans to ask the government to find one. The funeral home owner said everyone deserves to be buried. ""This is what we do in a civilized society, regardless of the circumstances,"" he said. 3. $28 million to go to victims . On Monday, officials from The One Fund Boston will unveil a tentative plan to distribute roughly $28 million to bombing victims and their families. Representatives will hold town hall meetings Monday and Tuesday in Copley Square to discuss the plan. Putting a price tag on suffering . Kenneth Feinberg, administrator of The One Fund Boston, told CNN's Don Lemon that while the amount of money might sound substantial, ""you have to dampen expectations."" ""I doubt anyone will be made whole by these allocations,"" he said. ""No amount of money distributed fairly quickly over the next month or two is going to provide the type of long-term financial stability"" needed by a double-amputee or somebody hospitalized with a brain injury, Feinberg said. ""There's just not enough money for those purposes."" 4. Residue in the kitchen sink . Federal authorities on Sunday searched Tamerlan Tsarnaev's apartment, the home he shared with his wife, Katherine Russell, and their young daughter. It was not immediately clear whether investigators had taken anything from the apartment Sunday. But on Friday, a source briefed on the investigation said law enforcement officials found explosives residue in the small apartment. The source said the residue turned up in at least three places: the kitchen table, the kitchen sink and the bathtub. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has said the two brothers built the bombs in the apartment, U.S. law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation have said. Russell, the widow, has remained largely out of view since her husband's death, staying in her parents' Rhode Island home. Her attorney, Amato DeLuca, said the 24-year-old knew nothing about plans to bomb the race, and reports of her husband's involvement came as an ""absolute shock"" to Russell and her family. 5. Wrong place, wrong time, wrong people . Amir Ismagulov, the father of Azamat Tazhayakov, said his son was simply at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people. Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev, both 19, are accused of obstruction of justice after allegedly removing the laptop and backpack from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's room. If convicted, they could face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Tazhayakov's father, who lives in Kazakhstan, told CNN in New York that he met with his son last week for about 40 minutes. Both father and son believe in the U.S. justice system, Ismagulov said. The government will get to the bottom of what happened and let Tazhayakov go, the father said in Russian. Teenagers sometimes do stupid things, Ismagulov said, stressing that his son didn't know he was doing anything wrong. CNN's Eric Fiegel, Greg Botelho and Rob Frehse contributed to this report.","A bombing suspect's friend accused of lying to authorities is due in court Monday .

"(CNN) -- An NBC sports announcer was playing the classic game of spot-celebrities-in-the-stands during the gold medal Olympics match in men's basketball when this happened: . ""I know I'm gonna put that picture on Facebook,"" Bob Fitzgerald said as the camera showed a young man with curly hair and a red hat, according to a video posted on the blog Deadspin. ""We've got every executive of note, it seems, worldwide, attending these Games."" The problem: The man in the audience wasn't Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. It was the actor, Jesse Eisenberg, who played him in the Academy Award-winning movie ""The Social Network."" Olympics viewers outraged after NBC cuts away . Oops, right? Well, the Internet won't quite let a gaffe like that pass without some dissection. ""Hey ball announcer: that was Jesse Eisenberg who played Marc Zuckerberg in a movie. He didn't create Facebook. #Olympics #NBCfail"" one user, Mike Sigmond, wrote on Twitter. ""The Eisenberg Principle - When you are absolutely certain that you're looking at Mark Zuckerberg but it's really Jesse Einsenberg. #NBCFail,"" wrote Sandy Sternshein. Another wrote that it was a ""buzzerbeater #NBCFail for the Olympics."" It was just another reason to revive what has been the omnipresent #NBCFail hashtag during the London Games. That meme mostly has been used by Americans who have loved to complain about the fact that many of the 2012 Olympic events were shown in the United States on a tape delay. But maybe there's something a little more interesting going on here: Sports announcers make mistakes all the time. Sure, it's live TV. But in the same way that the comedian Tina Fey sort of became Sarah Palin during the 2008 U.S. presidential race, Eisenberg became a sort of stand-in for Zuckerberg's real persona, particularly right after that movie debuted. (To make things all the more confusing, the pair appeared together on Saturday Night Live.) At the time, at least, some people seemed to know the fictional Zuck better than the real thing. Or perhaps that's still the case. The man who started #NBCFail on Twitter .","NBC sportscaster appears to mistake 'Social Network' actor for Mark Zuckerberg .

"(CNN) -- Getting an introduction to Tiger - a 176 pound (80 kilogram) Tibetan mastiff kept on the roof space of a cramped five-story village house in Hong Kong's New Territories -- is a complicated process. The first step is to stand as far away from his cage as is humanly possible; on just 600 square feet of roof space -- and with Tiger a barking, growling, slavering ball of caged fury - nowhere is really quite far enough away. The next step is for his owners to check that all doors are secured and that no one the dog doesn't know is wandering around. One of his owners then enters his cage, slips his chain off the hook bolted into the wall and wraps it tightly three times around his hand. Outside the cage, Tiger undergoes a personality change. Now happily around his owners, he's a placid, bearlike, drooling ball of household pet. Just don't pat him if you don't know him. The current vogue for Tibetan mastiffs in mainland China -- where the nouveau riche have reportedly paid as much as US$750,000 for prize-winning specimens -- has reached Hong Kong, though keeping big dogs in a city where the average flat size is just 484 square feet (45 square meters) presents a dangerous challenge. Tiger's owners, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, know only too well how much trouble a Tibetan mastiff can cause. A pack animal by instinct, and traditionally bred by Tibetan tribesmen to protect flocks against large wild predators such as wolves and snow leopards, the breed can be hostile to those it considers a threat to its family. ""We used to keep Tiger in the house and he was fine with everyone,"" his owner told CNN. ""But one day, the front door was left open, he got out and attacked a neighbor. The breed 'locks on' when they bite and this guy had to have 20 stitches. ""Fortunately for us, the neighbor understood about dogs and was quite reasonable about the whole thing, but it cost us $HK2,000 ($257 in U.S.) in fines,"" he said. Hong Kong-based vet and animal behaviorist Dr. Cynthia Smillie said Tibetan mastiffs, apart from being ill-suited to Hong Kong's muggy tropical climate, are temperamentally a poor fit in this densely-populated city where a high level of socialization is demanded of people let alone big dog breeds. She said of the two Tibetan mastiff she had dealt with, one had already been put down after attacking a man and hospitalizing him for several weeks. ""It's a very unsuitable dog for your average pet owner regardless of whether it's in Hong Kong or anywhere else -- you need to have a lot of experience to handle these dogs appropriately,"" said Smillie. ""They come from the Himalayas and because they haven't been bred in the West for a long period of time, they are still regarded as a primitive breed. So many of their instincts are hard-wired -- they have that deeply protective guarding instinct and they're very wary of strangers. ""Unless they're very well socialized as young dogs, they have the potential to be protective in situations that are not threatening. They can be quite reactive to perceived threats although they're very gentle with their own families and even with children."" Demand for the breed in Hong Kong -- often fueled by celebrity owners such as rock star Paul Wong formerly of the Canto rock group Beyond - has fueled a thriving, and sometimes illicit, business in mainland China. While Hong Kong, as a non-rabies zone, has stringent import restrictions on pets, requiring at least four months quarantine for dogs and cats imported from mainland China, it's not difficult to find pet shop owners in nearby Shenzhen that can deliver a Tibetan Mastiff to the front door of a Hong Kong apartment within two weeks. ""Don't worry about taking the dog over yourself,"" said a pet shop owner in Shenzhen's Nanshan District, a high-end strip of pet shops punctuated by the occasional wine cellar, an accurate pitch to the tastes of China's status-conscious middle class. ""We can put it into the animal hospital next door for two weeks so that you know it's healthy and then our people will take it over the border for you. ""The couriers have a 'special relationship' with the border authorities so it's no problem. Depending on the color you want, a Tibetan mastiff costs about 17,000RMB ($2,900) and I'll have to check on the delivery. ""Just to give you a rough idea, a small dog costs about 700 Renminbi to deliver and the price goes up depending on its size."" 700 Renminbi is about $113 U.S. dollars. Asked if he gets a lot of orders from Hong Kong, he produces a manila folder with a sheaf of some dozen or more orders from the special administrative region. ""Actually, pets in Shenzhen are so cheap that a lot of people make good money selling the dogs again in Hong Kong. It's a good business for them."" Fiona Woodhouse, the deputy director of welfare at Hong Kong's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, says puppy smuggling -- often feeding the demand for status symbol dogs - represents a real threat to Hong Kong's high standards of public health. ""We are very concerned about this,"" she said. ""If you go to pet markets in China, people will offer to get the dog to Hong Kong for you, but in a lot of our advertising we ask pet buyers not to do that because it's a serious risk. ""Firstly, you don't know how the animal has been kept or bred and there's a welfare issue for the mother and the puppies. Secondly, there's a disease risk with normal dog diseases such as parvovirus and distemper. But thirdly, and more importantly for the whole of Hong Kong, there's the risk of rabies. ""Hong Kong is rabies-free; we've got very good quarantine system and vaccination system but obviously smuggling puts that at real risk,"" she said. She says demand for status dog breeds in Hong Kong comes in waves and normally follows the release of Hollywood films and popular television shows. ""We might get a lot of huskies after a film like 'Below Zero', chihuahuas after all the 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua' films, dalmations after '101 Dalmations.' So we do get cycles, but they tend to be driven by popular culture rather than pure status over who's got the most expensive dog,"" she added. Ultimately, the problem of space in Hong Kong has driven home the reality of keeping inappropriate dogs in a highly urban environment. Woodhouse says the SPCA is seeing fewer instances of people keeping three Great Danes in 400 square foot flat. ""I can't say we don't get that anymore, but it's less of a problem than we used to see,"" she said. ""Way back in the early '90s when pet keeping was becoming popular -- and a lot of the animals were imported from overseas into Hong Kong -- you'd see the scenario where people would turn up with two St. Bernard puppies saying they couldn't afford the vet bills. ""I'd tell them 'Look, if you can't afford the vet bills, how are you going to afford to feed them? Because I can tell you, the bills you'll see today will be nothing next to what you'll have to pay in food in three months' time'.""","Popularity of Tibetan mastiff reaches Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- A CSX freight train collided with a commercial truck and derailed in the Baltimore area Tuesday, officials said, seriously injuring the truck's driver and leading to an explosion that a witness said could be felt blocks away. The crash happened in Rosedale, just to the east of Baltimore, firefighter Jonathan Meehan of Baltimore County said. The truck driver was taken to a hospital and is in serious but stable condition. An explosion and fire followed, sending up plumes of black smoke. But officials said there was little cause for concern. ""CSX indicates that there is no toxic inhalants, so we do not believe there is any substantial risk to the community,"" Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz told reporters. He said multiple buildings were damaged. Firefighters brought the blaze under control late Tuesday, Capt. Bruce Schultz with Baltimore County Fire Department said. As a precaution, authorities asked residents in some 60 to 70 homes to evacuate if they felt unsafe. ""We're going to look at establishing a shelter here in Rosedale. We'll provide transportation, but it's all voluntary,"" Hohman said. The cause of the accident was not immediately clear. The National Transportation Safety Board is sending a team to investigate. Video from CNN affiliate WBAL showed at least five of the train's cars off the track, and white and black smoke rising in separate columns from the wreckage. Kevin Lindemann told CNN he was working in Baltimore Windustrial, a plumbing supply warehouse along the track, when he felt something ""like an earthquake."" He went to a window. ""The first thing you see is two or three train cars flipped over the side, sliding down the track,"" said Lindemann, a sales representative at the warehouse, which he said is a few blocks from the nearest train-road intersection. Seeing one of the train's cars on fire, Lindemann and the other people in the warehouse left the building and drove away. The explosion happened after he and the others congregated a few blocks away, he said. ""I couldn't see (the explosion) directly, but it was deafening,"" he said. ""It almost forced you to your knees. There were a couple people that were knocked down by it."" The warehouse appeared to be damaged from the blast, Lindemann said after seeing aerial video of the crash site on TV. CNN iReporter Charlotte Curtis sent video of thick smoke with sirens wailing in the background. She said she was walking her puppy when she heard a big boom. The puppy went down on her belly, scared. ""It was huge, louder than any race car. It felt like it just knocked me in my back,"" Curtis said. 5 hospitalized after Connecticut train derailment .

"(CNN) -- Susan Boyle, a 48-year-old unemployed charity worker who became an international sensation after her audition for ""Britain's Got Talent"" in April, can now lay claim to a new achievement. Her debut CD, set to come out on November 23, has become the most pre-ordered CD in the history of Amazon.com, the online retailer said Thursday. Eager fans began ordering copies of the CD, ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" as soon as its release was announced late summer, pushing it to the top of the online retail chart ahead of Whitney Houston's much-anticipated comeback CD. ""One of the things that is so unique about Susan Boyle is her ability to touch people around the world,"" said Steve Barnett, the chairman of Columbia Records, in a statement. Before she sang during her audition in April, the unassuming single woman with a loose mop of curly hair drew snickers from the audience, including notoriously hard-to-please judge Simon Cowell. The scowls and eye-rolling were replaced by wild cheers as soon as she sang the first line of ""I Dreamed a Dream."" Even though she eventually lost out to a dance troupe in the TV competition, her pitch-perfect rendition of the ""Les Miserables"" number catapulted her into an overnight sensation with a string of global television appearances.","Susan Boyle sets new record as Amazon.com's most pre-ordered CD .

"(CNN) -- The Boston attacks have jolted Americans into a state of high alert. In the days and weeks after the marathon bombings, travelers and residents of major American cities are likely to be more aware of suspicious people and packages on city buses, subways and Amtrak trains, at the nation's airports and public spaces. More reports will stream in to already extra-vigilant authorities. But is that enough? If the past is any predictor, Americans may forget they're part of the solution and move on, say several security experts interviewed by CNN.com. Gathering and analyzing intelligence and adapting security measures to address threats is essential to preventing future attacks, but the public's increased participation also plays a key role, they say. Boston bombing, other incidents have us 'always looking for a way out' Secure airports mean softer targets . Whatever the debate about carrying knives or liquids on airplanes, heightened security at the nation's airports in the years since the 9/11 attacks may have shifted terrorists' attention to softer targets. ""Once we secure a high-value target like aviation, terrorists don't simply walk away,"" says Rafi Ron, president of Virginia-based New Age Security Solutions and former head of security of Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel. ""They simply go for softer targets, public events like the Boston Marathon. It's extremely difficult if not impossible to provide the same level of security we do at the airport at such an open public event."" The solution, says Ron, is public vigilance. ""People must be willing to call authorities when they spot suspicious packages or see people behaving suspiciously,"" he says. ""If you walk into a bus station in Israel and you see an unattended bag, people would respond to this immediately without hesitation. And in many cases, tragedies have been prevented because of early detection."" Security has been enhanced at transportation hubs ""using measures both seen and unseen,"" the Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday. The agency is urging Americans to report suspicious activity to local law enforcement. Terrorists make us lose sight of the real dangers . 'If you see something, say something' The message behind the slogan that came to symbolize New York City's call for its residents to help after the September 11 attacks and is now a national homeland security campaign, ""if you see something, say something"" is essential to protecting soft targets such as public transit, experts say. Since it's nearly impossible to make city buses and subways completely secure, transit workers and riders of public transportation need to know to be on the lookout for any possible threats -- and report them, according to former New Jersey Transit police chief Joseph Bober, now a principal at Homeland Defense Solutions. ""Educating these individuals through training, constant security awareness and providing proper channels to immediately report their suspicions"" is key to safer public transportation, wrote Bober, via e-mail. Airports are still targets . While checkpoints and multi-layered security make airports more difficult to breach, that doesn't mean they're off the hook. Making an airport secure isn't simply screening passengers before they enter an airport's boarding area, global aviation consultant Mike Boyd of Boyd Group International. Airport officials must ensure that everything on the premises is secure. ""How many security observation sweeps are made of the parking garage? Have the vulnerabilities of the air conditioning systems been reviewed? Trash cans -- where are they located in regard to passenger flows? Are they blast-resistant? Is the catering facility across the field monitored? How about the fuel farm? How much scrutiny is given to the workers who are pouring concrete for that new taxiway?"" He also wants to know which law enforcement agency is in charge during an emergency and what the agency's plans are to secure and evacuate sections of the airport in case of an incident. Does an airport terminal's plan for evacuation simply send passengers outside, where they could be an easy target? ""Confusion is a terrorist's best friend,"" says Boyd. Attacks are always possible . ""We are a free society, and unless we want to live and stay in caves we will always be vulnerable,"" says Boyd. ""Even places like banks -- which are somewhat prepared -- get robbed. Any idiot can concoct a bomb and toss it into a public street."" Americans need to be in the fight for the long haul, says Chief Bober. ""Incidents such as yesterday aren't going to stop overnight and the quicker we learn as a nation of people to protect ourselves and our families against such horrific acts, the better chance we will have to prevent and detect the next incident. "" Will you still travel to large cities in light of these latest attacks? Or will they keep you away for now? Please share in the comments below.","The American public must be part of preventing terrorism, experts say .
""Soft targets"" like public transit systems need riders to report suspicious activity .

"Seoul (CNN) -- To the outside world the images from North Korean state television are nearly comical -- weeping soldiers chasing Kim Jong Un into the freezing sea, elderly women screaming as the young leader approaches, and North Koreans unleashing dogs at a poorly made effigy of a South Korean leader. But as Chae Young Hee watches, her eyes begin to brim with tears and her lips tremble uncontrollably with national pride. Chae is not a North Korean anymore, having defected to South Korea 11 years ago, abandoning the totalitarian regime. In the North, she experienced starvation, the brutality of the regime and fled with her daughter in hope of a better life in the free world. But as Chae watches KCTV, the North's only television channel its citizens can view, the power of the propaganda she grew up with takes hold. ""They're God,"" she says, referring to North Korea's trinity, Kim Jong Un, his father Kim Jong Il, and grandfather Kim Il Sung. The tears are now running down Chae's perfectly made up face and she chokes back a sob. ""This is how you are brought up since birth. Even I can feel the pull in my heart. I thought I forgot about this feeling since it has been so long. ""But seeing this now, I feel I'm back in North Korea. I don't know how to express myself. He is really great and I feel we will all die without him."" Chae stops talking and asks for a glass of water. She tries to compose herself. ""I know their sincerity,"" she says, as she watches a group of soldiers sing and sway before Kim, their faces red with emotion and streaked with tears. ""This is not a lie. It is not an act. It is real. If anything happens, they will give up their lives. They will even jump into fire."" Chae seems to fall into an other-worldly trance, unable to answer questions as clearly as she did before the North Korean television started to play. She watches children's programs, which always have the evil American or South Korean villain that must be defeated. Prime-time movies are often war movies or romantic tales where the North Koreans defeat the American imperialists. Chae laughs as she sees a program she recognizes from her childhood, a clay action movie where an adorable North Korean cat defeats the evil South Korean rats. Watching her slip back into her time as a Pyongyang resident is a window into how the North Korean regime manages to maintain its seemingly unyielding hold on its people. ""Even if I tried to explain this, I don't think people here would understand. They won't think this is real,"" she says, watching a news clip of adoring citizens waving flowers and rushing to the young leader. ""But this is true. That is the truth. And we can't think for ourselves. When North Koreans watch news on the dear leader, they believe in it. We live because of him.""","Chae Young Hee abandoned North Korea for the South 11 years ago .

"(CNN) -- When U.S. negotiators raise the issue of captured U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl with the Taliban in the coming days, it won't be the first time. The two sides held meetings in 2011 and 2012 that included the topic of Bergdahl's release, with sporadic discussions since then. The first series of talks took place in 2011 with the State Department's top representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. He met Taliban representatives again the next year. An American proposal for Bergdahl's release was a topic each time, U.S. officials told CNN in May 2012. Talks offer hope for family . The meetings after early 2012 were sporadic, but they did continue, and again Bergdahl was discussed. ""He has been gone far too long,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday. ""We continue to call for and work towards his safe and immediate release."" While the United States has been pushing for the return of Bergdahl -- captured in June 2009 in Afghanistan -- the Taliban has been pushing for the release of five of its own men from U.S. custody in Guantanamo Bay. Psaki said the United States expects the Taliban will raise that issue again when the two sides meet. In the past, U.S. officials have talked about transferring the Guantanamo detainees in two stages -- perhaps two men first, and then after Bergdahl is released, transferring the remaining three. Senior U.S. officials have also discussed the idea of transferring all five Taliban prisoners to Qatar first, before Bergdahl is freed. Under U.S. law, Congress must be consulted before any detainees are transferred from Guantanamo. CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","The two sides held meetings in 2011 and 2012 .

"West, Texas (CNN) -- Since they were little boys growing up West, Texas, brothers Doug and Robert Snokhous did everything together. They fixed cars, went hunting, golfed and barbecued together. It just made sense that they would both become volunteer firefighters, and that they were side by side last Wednesday when they rushed to a fire at the West Fertilizer Co. The brothers were among 14 people who died after the fire led to a massive explosion at the distributor. The blast decimated not only the company's building but ravaged practically the entire north side of the small farming community. The nine first-responders from West who died battling the blaze represented nearly one-third of the town's volunteer firefighting and EMT force. The fire destroyed three fire trucks and an ambulance. Firefighters and trucks from neighboring communities now fill the void at the West firehouse. Among the others who rushed to the fire and lost their lives: Kenneth ""Luckey"" Harris Jr., a 52-year-old Dallas firefighter who lives in West, and two friends of first responders whose identities have not been confirmed by authorities. Two other people were killed in their apartment nearby. By Monday afternoon, a Facebook page ""Prayers for West"" had been ""liked"" nearly 80,000 times. Besides offering thoughtful messages, the page served as a kind of bulletin board for people in West trying to coordinate donations and help each other. Reporters have been given access to the devastated area. It resembles the wake of a tornado -- trees are uprooted, an apartment building's walls are blown off, and enormous chunks of concrete litter the surrounding fields. The disaster has rocked the community and, even in the shadow of the Boston Marathon bombings, which have received the lion's share of media coverage this past week, it has reverberated throughout the country. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will go to Baylor University in Waco, Texas, on Thursday to attend a memorial service for the victims of the blast, White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Monday. Texas town tries to rebuild with community, spirituality . Townspeople devastated and displaced . At the time of the blast, West Fertilizer Co. was closed for business, so there were no workers inside, officials said. The explosion injured hundreds of people who lived near the distributor, authorities said, and others were without a place to live because the blast damaged their homes. West's high school and middle school were damaged. Investigators searched for clues Monday morning in the 22-foot-deep crater left when a stockpile of ammonium nitrate exploded. At a Monday afternoon press conference Assistant State Fire Marshal Kelly Kistner told reporters that officials are confident the neighborhood near the site of the explosion is safe. Several authorities spoke at the news conference but offered few details about the investigation, noting that they are being methodical and that the probe will take time. At a news conference Sunday evening, officials said determining how many volatile chemicals were in the facility will be difficult because the company's records were destroyed in the blast. They are attempting to find the records elsewhere. The start of school Monday gave some members of this small community a feeling that many had not enjoyed for days -- a calm familiarity . The elementary school in West is the only local school that wasn't damaged in the blast. Some parents escorted their children inside the school Monday. Counselors were at the ready. Many of the parents' cars had lettering marked by police, an indication that the families live within the area affected by the blast. Dr. Marty Crawford, the superintendent of West Independent School District, and his staff worked through the weekend to get the elementary school ready for class Monday. On Sunday evening, the high-energy administrator barked orders to staff carrying boxes of supplies up and down the school's hallways. The town's high school and middle school were too damaged to hold classes. So on Monday, about 500 high school and middle school students opened their books in Waco, about 15 miles south of their hometown. In the days after the blast, officials in nearby school districts put their heads together to come up with a plan to help stranded students in West. One school district donated 13 buses to drive the kids to Connally Independent School District in Waco, which provided extra classroom space. As the students arrived, teachers shook hands and hugged West students. To help the West students feel more at home, volunteers worked through the weekend to paint some of the classrooms with West's colors -- yellow and scarlet -- and some Connally students wore red to school, said Wesley Holt, a Connally spokesman. Back in West, a small town kept trying to cope. Evacuated townspeople began returning home over the weekend. Authorities allowed a second wave to revisit their homes Sunday. The process was going well, said Steve Vanek, West's mayor pro tem. Texas state police were keeping a close watch on cordoned-off areas near the blast site, he said, and a strict curfew is being enforced. Those returning home to the areas still cordoned found a heavy police presence and numerous checkpoints. Their homes are just as they left them when they were abruptly evacuated out of fears a toxic cloud of gas would engulf the community. Many of the homes have broken windows, and all have a spray-painted ""X"" on the front door. The ""X"" shows that officials had searched the homes for victims. Brothers and friends lost . On Sunday evening, representatives recited prepared remarks from some grieving families. One speaker said that Doug and Robert Snokhous ""were much more than brothers. They were lifelong friends."" The siblings lived a half-mile from each other in West, and both worked at Central Texas Iron Works in Waco. Doug had been there for 30 years; Robert had just reached his 20th year at the company. ""They were always together and we are comforted that they were together in the end,"" the family said. The family of volunteer firefighter Jerry Chapman said that ""other firemen and women survived because of the action he took."" Chapman wanted to ""live on the edge,"" according to a statement read for reporters, and ""his faith in God and fellow firefighters gave him the strength to lay down his life for others."" Chapman ""died a hero,"" his family believes. An obituary for the Dallas firefighter who lived in West, ""Luckey"" Harris, said he loved offshore fishing with his sons and spending time on his boat, the ""Boots Up."" He had been married, the obit says, for 28 years. CNN is working to confirm the names of others who died. Also a picture of the injured was beginning to emerge, as some hospital officials released details Monday. Two patients were still in critical condition at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, officials said. Thirty-nine patients had been treated and released from Hill Regional Hospital in Hillsboro. Of the 28 patients admitted to Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center in Waco, seven remained there Monday. Five of those patients were in the intensive care unit, officials said. There were also two young ""trauma"" patients at a children's hospital in Temple. CNN was still trying to gather information from other hospitals in the area that tended to the wounded from last week's explosion. Consolation in church . Meanwhile on Sunday, as parishioners streamed out of St. Mary's Catholic Church after Sunday's service, Father Boniface Onjefu hugged and consoled his congregants, and gave reassuring smiles and high fives to the church's youngest members. ""West is a strong city. We shall definitely overcome this tragedy,"" Onjefu told those assembled at his church, about a mile from the explosion site. Several members of St. Mary's were killed or injured battling the blaze, Onjefu told CNN. During the service, the priest told congregants what he saw on that awful day. He had just returned to the rectory when he heard the blast. ""I thought it was an earthquake,"" he said. The lights flickered on and off as his small two-story brick residence shook from the explosion. Onjefu said that when he headed outside, he was awestruck by a large, dark plume of smoke rising on the north side of town. He got into his car and drove toward it. The priest was one of the first to arrive in the destroyed part of town. He immediately began helping remove victims from a severely damaged nursing home. He told his congregants that he had witnessed ""fear in the eyes"" of people walking the streets of West. The church's parking lot became a staging area, of sorts, for police and first responders who have flooded the north central Texas community since the blast. Long lines of cars streamed by West's community center, dropping off food, water and other rations throughout the weekend. Numerous church groups and restaurants handed out hot meals. ""These are our neighbors. They are coming to help,"" Waco Police Department Sgt. William Patrick Swanton told reporters. ""You will find that in Texas. You will find that across the United States. We put everything aside when it comes to these types of situations."" The cause of the fire and explosion has not been determined yet, but investigators have isolated the center of the blast, Assistant State Fire Marshal Kistner said Sunday. The explosion left a large crater in the middle of the distributor, Kistner said. Funeral arrangements are pending for those killed. CNN's Todd Sperry reported from West, Texas; CNN's Martin Savidge, John Murgatroyd, Eric Fiegel and Gustavo Valdes contributed to this report from West, Texas; CNN's Ashley Fantz, Matt Smith and Mark Morgenstein contributed from Atlanta.","A business that distributed fertilizer exploded in West, Texas, on Wednesday, killing 14 .

"(CNN) -- Now that the Supreme Court has invalidated part of Arizona's voter registration law, states should be thinking twice before introducing laws to make it harder to cast a ballot. Monday's decision is indeed a big victory for voters — but it is also a stark reminder that free, fair and accessible elections in the United States are not as guaranteed as you might think. To fix this, we need to modernize our election system. The Supreme Court took a critical step toward this, confirming Congress' broad authority to regulate how we conduct federal elections, particularly as politicians in states across the country continue to push new laws that would make it harder for Americans to vote. Dozens of restrictive measures passed in 19 states before the 2012 election. Citizens, the courts, and the Justice Department blocked or weakened most of them, but the push has continued in 2013. The court's decision gives federal lawmakers an even stronger basis to provide minimum national standards for voting and bring our election system into the 21st century. The court also made it clear that states may not undermine Congress' effort to streamline the voter registration process for federal elections. In 1993, Congress passed the National Voter Registration Act, also known as the ""motor voter"" law, to upgrade registration. At the time, it was a terrific advancement for voters. It increased access to registration by providing one simple, uniform application form that could be used to register for federal elections in any state. It entitled all Americans to register to vote by mail and encouraged voter registration drives. It also gave citizens the opportunity to register while applying for a driver's license and other government services (hence the nickname). This law has worked remarkably well. Voter registration rates surged after its passage; almost 16 million Americans register each year using its procedures. But in 2004, Arizona passed a law that contradicted motor voter. It required voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering. If voters submitted a federal registration without these documents, Arizona rejected their applications. This prevented tens of thousands of citizens from registering, made it difficult for many to register by mail, and dramatically cut back on community-based drives. The court's decision stops that from happening. It resoundingly affirms what Congress tried to do with motor voter: create minimum national standards and streamline the registration process. But we shouldn't stop there. Two decades ago, computers were still new to public institutions. Now they're everywhere and in the palm of our hands. Motor voter was the solution for the 20th century, but it has relied on error-prone paper forms and the mail. It is still ramshackle—illegible handwriting leads to mistyped names and addresses, for one thing-- and a chief cause of long lines and Election Day chaos. This can jeopardize a person's right to vote and harm the integrity of our elections. There are better solutions for the 21st century. We need to change the way we think about voter registration and move our system into the digital age. If citizens take the responsibility to register to vote, the government has the responsibility to ensure they can. Existing technology can give citizens the choice to be electronically registered to vote at the same time they do business with a government office, such as when they apply for a driver's license or state veterans' benefits. We can also enable citizens to register online and stay registered if they move or change their address. This would add 50 million eligible Americans to the rolls, cost less and curb the potential for fraud. Fortunately, we've seen movement across the country. Already, most states-- including several this year--have implemented key reforms. Colorado passed a broad modernization bill, and Virginia and West Virginia instituted online registration. In January, Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, introduced the Voter Empowerment Act, which includes modernization at its core. Judging by the long lines last November, we clearly need national voting standards that make voting speedy and efficient. Motor voter does that—and we are thankful the court agreed— but it's not enough. To ensure our elections remain open to all eligible Americans, registration must be brought into the 21st century — now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wendy Weiser .","Wendy Weiser: Supreme Court's Arizona ruling points up need for voting modernization in U.S.

She says registration must move to digital age, replacing paper system, admitting more voters .

"(CNN) -- Businesswoman Isabel Dos Santos, daughter of long-serving Angolan president Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, is Africa's first female billionaire, according to business publication Forbes. The 40-year-old's investments in publicly traded companies in Portugal, including shares in a cable TV firm, as well her assets in at least one Angolan bank, ""have pushed her net worth over the $1 billion mark,"" said the magazine, known for its annual rich lists. Her first business endeavor was in 1997 when she opened a restaurant in Angola's capital, Luanda, according to the magazine. Since then, she's expanded her business interests to a number of industries, sitting on the boards of several Angolan and Portuguese companies. A former Portuguese colony, Angola is the second largest oil producer in the continent. Over the last decade, the southwestern African country has emerged from the wreckage of a 27-year civil war to become one of the continent's major economic players.

"New York (CNN) -- A week before Barack Obama became the first U.S. president to mention gay rights in his inauguration speech, the French had already made history on that matter. Believe it or not, on January 13, there were half a million people on the streets of Paris, demonstrating against gay marriage. The French Catholic church is supposed to be at its last gasp, but it seemed strong enough to mobilize parishes, religious school parents and the common conservative citizen against a project of ""mariage pour tous"" (marriage for everybody), that had long been part of the new Socialist President FranÃ§ois Hollande's election platform. Now that the law is being debated in parliament, it will likely pass within a month, but the ruckus will have stripped it of provisions deemed essential to the gay community: the equal rights, even if they are married, to start a family and raise their children. It may also trigger off a new culture war. The Church would not have enjoyed that success alone, had it not found the most unexpected and efficient leader, in the person of Virginie Tellenne, alias ""Frigide Barjot."" The nom-de-scÃ¨ne of this enterprising entertainer, known for her long-time connection to the RPR, the party of Jacques Chirac, means ""cookoo,"" and was a rallying cry for silly demonstrations, in the 80s, against cold weather in Paris, before she met God in 2004, and proclaimed herself ""Jesus's PR person."" I saw her recently on a French TV channel while, in her trademark miniskirt and fishnets, she was debating a lesbian activist named Caroline Fourest, who asked Barjot how she felt about ""gathering hundred of thousand of people in a demonstration against the equal rights of another community."" She answered that she ""loved gays,"" reminding the audience she often ""partied like crazy"" at Bananas, a well known hangout of the hip Parisian LGBT crowd. Translation: gay was okay as long as it stayed in the ""cage aux folles,"" in drag, in an entertaining margin, but certainly not in the mundane realities of everyday life, where it is way more complicated. Indeed. Frigide, just like a majority of the French, supported the civil union enacted in 1999, the so-called Pacs, designed mainly for same sex couples. It gives some rights, but doesn't legitimate partners as parents. Marriage would. And there is the rub: adoption, medically assisted procreation. ""What about the bloodline? What about mother nature, and the right of kids raised that way to know their true origin?, shrieked Frigide, oblivious to the fact that children adopted or medically procreated with donated eggs by straight parents have the same problem. It all boiled down, at the minute of truth, to that question: ""What about their right to be raised normally? she asked. By a mommy and a daddy?"" Having witnessed the debate on same-sex marriage in the United States, that episode confirms one more difference between our cultures. Contrary to the Americans who, in spite of blunt evidence, still worship the act of marriage, with its fairy-tale rituals of proposing and funny kneeling, the French have a much more pessimistic, more realistic even, vision of the knot. But when it comes to families and raising kids, they seem to believe in the enchanted world of yore. In America, the same-sex unions were often seen as the sinful problem, as the Christian banners, ""Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve"" proclaimed around the country. But children were nobody else's business for those willing to adopt, or procreate with the methods available to anyone able to pay for donated eggs, sperm or a surrogate mother. France is another story. In a country where unrealistic conditions slacken usual adoption, gay prospective parents have had to act as any straight single person would, ask for an adoption authorization, and, to improve the chances ... get the child in another country. The law debated these days may grant their partner equal parental rights for adoption. As for medically assisted procreation, it is another problem: As of today, it is simply forbidden unless the couple is heterosexual and married or able to prove they has lived together for at least two years. Surrogate mothers are prohibited in France, plain and simple. Hollande himself, though he promotes gay marriage as a progressive symbol, admitted he doesn't personally favor allowing medically assisted reproduction to homosexuals, and with the assent of many socialist party officials, had these corresponding measures postponed -- for parliament to decide -- as another law to a future debate, in March, or never. One reason, besides the obvious fear of a culture war with the conservatives about sacred family values, maybe the fact that the government already pays four attempts of medically assisted procreation to heterosexual couples and doesn't wish to have to extend this costly favor to gays, nor, more importantly, does it want to change at any price the national moral doctrine. Assisted reproduction is considered in France only as a way to treat the medical condition of infertility. Being gay is not an illness, neither is, for a woman, the fact that she has no man. As a consequence, French babies are born en masse from single and not-so-single mothers in nearby Belgium or Spain, where specialized services are legally available for a price. ""These children already exist in France,"" concluded Caroline Fourest on the show.""They were born from gay parents and they simply deserve to have it recognized."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Philippe Coste.","On January 13, half a million demonstrated against gay marriage in Paris .

"(CNN) -- South African police are investigating abuse allegations at the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy, the talk-show host's $40 million school for disadvantaged girls near Johannesburg. Oprah Winfrey, who founded the school this year, has apologized in connection with the incident. Investigators declined to provide details of the alleged abuse and said no charges have been filed. The academy's CEO, John Samuel, said in a statement earlier this month that an internal inquiry was launched based on a claim of misconduct involving a dormitory parent. According to an article in The Cape Argus, a Cape Town newspaper, the dorm parent allegedly grabbed a pupil by the throat and threw her against a wall, the girl claimed. Girls at the school also claimed that the matron swore and screamed at the girls and assaulted them, the newspaper reported Saturday. The newspaper said one of the pupils ran away from the school, blaming the alleged abuse. In an emergency meeting with pupils and parents at the school, Winfrey apologized in connection with the incident. ""I've disappointed you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry,"" she said tearfully, according to numerous South African media reports. Winfrey's representatives said she flew to South Africa twice in October to meet with parents of girls at the academy, although they would not specify what the meetings were about. Previously, Winfrey -- who has spoken publicly about the abuse she suffered as a child -- issued a statement on October 17 saying, ""Nothing is more serious or devastating to me than an allegation of misconduct by an adult against any girl at the academy."" In the statement, Samuel said South African child protection services were notified and that the dorm parent was removed from the campus. ""We have engaged professional investigators of the highest standing from South Africa and the United States to conduct a fair and impartial inquiry into these claims,"" the statement said. The school's head has agreed to take a paid leave of absence pending the results of the investigation, although she is not the subject of the allegation, Samuel said. The national prosecuting authority is deciding whether or not criminal charges will be filed. In an October 23 statement, Samuel referred inquiries to the South African Child Protection Services Unit. The academy opened in January with a student body made up of some of South Africa's poorest children. The academy provides its 450 students with textbooks, uniforms and meals.

"London (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has been setting out his vision for the country in a speech to the loya jirga, or national assembly. Karzai called the four-day assembly to sound out tribal elders on a long-term pact with the U.S. military. He has already been critical of NATO, calling on limits to the remit of foreign troops. ""We want our sovereignty from today,"" he told the meeting. CNN correspondents say the assembly is considered by many as an important step towards any possible peace deal with elements of the insurgency, and a test of Karzai's strength as a cohesive leader. But the meeting has also drawn criticism. The UK's Daily Telegraph questions its purpose and reports unnamed diplomats and Afghan politicians describing it as a piece of political theater that exists to rubber stamp decisions made by the president's inner circle. And in a recent interview with The Washington Examiner, former presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah accused Karzai of ""manipulating the system for his benefit."" The Taliban has threatened to attack anyone who attends, and has published on a website what it claimed was government security plans for the meeting. The Afghan Interior Ministry has dismissed them as fake. Gareth Price examines some key questions for CNN about the assembly and whether it still has a role. What is the loya jirga? According to the 2004 Afghan constitution, loya jirgas (or grand assemblies) are held to take decisions relating to Afghanistan's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and the ""supreme interests of the country,"" to amend the constitution or to prosecute the president. The current loya jirga is intended to discuss a proposed longer-term military relationship with the United States as well as ways to push forward reconciliation with the Taliban. The constitution also states that loya jirgas consist of members of the national assembly and the chairpersons of the provincial and district councils. However, tribal elders, religious leaders and representatives of civil society, also attend. In turn, a number of parliamentarians are boycotting the meeting. How did it originate? Jirgas originated as a means of resolving differences between different Pashtun tribes (or clans). Traditionally, Pashtun tribal elders and religious leaders held jirgas to meet to discuss problems, appoint new leaders and so forth. From the late 19th century representatives of Afghanistan's other ethnic groups -- such as Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks -- were invited and the process became more formalized. Some commentators have questioned its function. Why are they so critical? The fundamental criticism of the loya jirga is that it sidelines the democratic institutions such as the parliament set up in recent years. The 250 members of Afghanistan's lower house are marginalized by the 1,800 non-elected attendees of the meeting. This raises questions over the depth of democracy within the country. At the same time, a number of parliamentarians fear that President Hamid Karzai is planning to use the meeting to push through constitutional changes that would allow him to remain in power once his current term ends. At present the president is only allowed to serve two terms. Karzai has denied these claims. Why has the Taliban chosen to target the loya jirga? One of the main subjects for discussion at the loya jirga is whether to allow the U.S. to maintain a longer-term military presence in Afghanistan. Many Afghans believe that without a U.S. presence, their country will be vulnerable to interference by its neighbors, as well as to the Taliban. The Taliban is attempting to position itself as a force resisting occupation, so aside from simply demonstrating its military reach, the loya jirga may make a decision which undermines their primary demand which is for foreign forces to leave. At the same time, the other element of the loya jirga is to push forward reconciliation with the Taliban. There is widespread public support within Afghanistan for the reconciliation process but an absence of strategy over how to push the process forward, particularly in the aftermath of the assassination of the head of the High Peace Council, Burhanuddin Rabbani, in September. However, amongst non-Pashtuns in particular, there is greater wariness of any moves that would allow the Taliban to return to power. Many of those most opposed have boycotted the meeting. Who gains from this meeting? The U.S. will be pleased if the meeting backs the idea of military-bases. If the meeting provides a political strategy to deal with the Taliban, then it would be deemed a success. On the other hand, if the meeting fails to deliver then Karzai's position will be weakened. Having chosen to sideline the democratic institutions, he needs to demonstrate that he does have a wider support base among traditional power structures. Do tribal and ethnic affiliations still have a bearing? Tribal and ethnic affiliations remain strong in Afghan society, and particularly in rural areas. With a multitude of languages spoken in Afghanistan, most Afghans first identify with others who speak the same language. However, tribal, familial and geographic identities are also important. Many Afghans place their ""clan"" identity before their ""ethnic"" identity. Such localized loyalties appear to have intensified as society broke down during the Soviet occupation and in the subsequent civil war. So is there a future for this loya jirga system of government? While notions of tribal identity remain strong, there will be a constant temptation to sideline elected institutions. At the same time, the ""democratic"" institutions also have an over-representation of ""traditional"" tribal leaders. Political power stems from gaining votes: tribal leaders frequently decide which way their group will vote in the hope of gaining access to patronage in the future. At the same time, political parties are also sidelined in the current political system, reinforcing a system in which access to power and resources stems from family links rather than political differences. Both factors suggest that the power of tribal elites, and hence of jirgas, is going to remain a factor in Afghan politics for a while. In time, if Afghanistan was to undergo a sustained period of economic development and urbanization it would seem reasonable to assume that traditional power structures would be replaced by newer democratic institutions, based on merit or political ideology rather than birthright. However, for the foreseeable future, that seems a long way off. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gareth Price.","Jirgas originated as a way of resolving differences between different Pashtun tribes .

"(CNN) -- The Daytona 500 ran as scheduled Sunday despite a jaw-dropping crash a day earlier that flung debris into the stands at the Daytona International Speedway. At least 28 fans were injured when more than a dozen cars piled up in the final curve of the Nationwide Series Drive4COPD 300 in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Saturday. Some of the debris went over a 22-foot-high fence that was built in 2010, and some of it went through holes as the fence shredded when a car slammed into it and bounced back onto the track. ""At 8 a.m., we met with NASCAR, we reviewed all of the repairs that we made last evening,"" speedway president Joie Chitwood told reporters Sunday morning. ""We worked late into the evening and are prepared to go racing today."" Some of the fans who were sitting in that area returned for Sunday's race, which began just after 1 p.m. ET, Chitwood said. Jimmie Johnson won the race, edging out Dale Earnhardt Jr. and a host of others down the stretch. The wreck occurred when several closely packed cars were jostling for position at top speeds of about 175 mph. They got tangled up, setting off a dangerous chain reaction that ensnared several vehicles. Reigning Sprint Cup champ Brad Keselowski, who later told CNN on Saturday that he and others were simply ""going for the win,"" was among those involved, while Tony Stewart somehow emerged unscathed and won the race. Driver Kyle Larson's vehicle ended up flying into a fence that separates the track from spectators. The car broke into pieces, including tires and a fiery engine. Larson walked away from the crash, even after the front part of his No. 32 car was gone. He and the other nine drivers involved told reporters that they were checked at a medical tent on the Daytona infield and released. Some pieces of the shredded debris flew into the barrier, while others got into the stands -- some of it reaching the second level. Chitwood said the fence had been replaced after a similar incident at Talladega in which a car hit the fence and seven fans were injured. A video posted on YouTube shows a cloud of debris flying into stands and one man gasping, ""Oh, my God."" A tire rests on one seat, as a man frantically waves and yells to get the attention of paramedics. Afterward, several spectators could be seen lying down after apparently suffering injuries. About 10 ambulances lined up on the track, with some first responders carrying stretchers. Fourteen fans were treated at an on-site medical facility, and 14 others were transported to area hospitals, Chitwood told reporters. ""I'm just hoping everyone is OK,"" Keselowski said. ""As drivers, we assume the risk. But fans do not."" NASCAR president Mike Helton earlier told ESPN, which was broadcasting the race, that some people were taken to Halifax Health Medical Center. He said the protective fence did its job in preventing potentially more injuries and possibly deaths. Byron Cogdell, a spokesman for the hospital, told CNN that his facility had treated 12 patients. By early Sunday evening, seven patients -- each of whom is considered stable -- were still being treated at Halifax Health, the hospital said in a statement. Staff at Florida Hospital Memorial Medical Center treated four people, spokeswoman Lindsay Rew said Saturday evening. The injured include Eddie Huckaby, a 53-year-old Krum, Texas, resident who suffered a leg gash when a large piece of metal hit him as he was watching the race, his brother Terry Huckaby told CNN affiliate WKMG. He described part of the motor landing in the stands, as well as a wheel, ""and everything flying over your head and debris everywhere."" ""He's doing fine,"" Terry Huckaby said of his brother, who had surgery at Halifax Health Medical Center. ""The first thing he said, 'I don't want to miss that (Daytona 500) race, but I have to watch on TV.' "" Accidents are nothing new to NASCAR, where cars often cruise at speeds near 200 mph, nor are they new to the Daytona track. One of the sport's most horrific, and well-known, wrecks happened in the 2001 Daytona 500, when seven-time NASCAR champion Dale Earnhardt Sr. was killed -- also on that race's final lap. Still, injuries and fatalities to spectators are much rarer. CNN's John Newsome and Joe Carter reported from Daytona Beach, and Greg Botelho wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Phil Gast, Dan Moriarty, Scott Thompson and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","NEW: Halifax Health is treating seven patients -- all of them stable -- the hospital says Sunday .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Subtlety may not be in Kevin Smith's vocabulary, but a lot of off-color words are. They're sprinkled liberally throughout the writer-director's new movie, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno."" Kevin Smith can't understand why the word ""porno"" is still a hot button for some people. The comedy stars Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks as roommates and longtime friends who decide that the solution to their money problems is to make a porn film. Strong language is nothing new for Smith, whose first film, ""Clerks,"" put him on the map with its merrily scatological musings. Though the film had little violence or exposed skin, it was initially given an NC-17 rating by the MPAA based on the language. ""Zack and Miri"" was also a possibility for an NC-17, considered the kiss of death by studios because of distributing and marketing challenges, until Smith argued its merits to the ratings board and received an R. Since ""Clerks,"" Smith's films have been almost wistfully romantic (""Chasing Amy,"" ""Jersey Girl"") or as joyfully profane as ""Clerks"" (""Dogma,"" ""Clerks II""). ""Zack and Miri,"" which opens Friday, is a blend of the two Smiths: full of sex and colorful language, but with a sweet side. Indeed, Banks told CNN not to be fooled by the film's tawdry talk. ""Kevin Smith is a huge romantic,"" she said. ""He likes to wrap up the romance in profanity, but the guy is more sweet than spicy.""  Watch why ""Zack and Miri"" is so controversial » . In an interview with CNN, Smith, 38, cheerfully acknowledged that this is not a film for prudes. The following is an edited version of the conversation. Kevin Smith: There's a bit of language in this picture. I'm not going to lie to you. ... I don't even think of it as salty. To me, it's just like part of a lexicon. CNN: Well, you do hear it a lot. Smith: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no doubt. We're raising our kid in a household where people curse, as an experiment. And I think our experiment is working, because I don't tame my language around the kid. I don't run up to her and yell [expletive] in her face, but I don't go out of my way to like not curse in front of her. And honestly, ironically, she doesn't curse. And I've tried to get her to curse for like friends and family, because it's always entertaining to hear a child curse, and she doesn't do it. CNN: Well ... I almost hesitate to ask, but tell me what the genesis was of the film. Smith: It's a movie I've been researching since I was like 12 years old, to be honest with you. And sometimes three or four times a day. ... But it only really came together when I saw Seth Rogen in ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" and instantly fell in love with him and was like, ""I got to work with this guy."" ... So I started thinking about this movie, and immediately it kind of crystallized. Seeing Seth and thinking about porn, I was like, boom, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno."" I wrote the script with him in mind. And by the time I finished with it, ""Knocked Up"" was about to open, and the word was it was going to be huge, so I was like, we missed our window. This guy's going to be famous, and he'll want nothing to do with this movie. But I sent him an e-mail anyway where I said, ""Look, man, I wrote this flick with you in mind. Please give it a read."" ... And I got an e-mail back within five minutes that said, ""When I first came to Los Angeles, an agent asked me what I wanted to do with my career. I said I wanted to be in a Kevin Smith movie. That has not changed. Please send me the script; I would be honored to read it."" And I was, I was like cha-ching! You know, my God, it worked out. CNN: You're working with some professionals here, and by that I don't mean Seth and Elizabeth. I mean working with actual people with porn experience. Smith: We got ourselves a former pro. ... Traci Lords, man. Who, for the last 20 years, has not made an adult film. Has been keeping that industry at arm's length as she concentrates on a mainstream career and her musical career and stuff like that. But you know, it just seemed like if we're going to make this movie, Traci Lords would just fit into it so well. We approached her agent, and her agent was like, I don't know, it's got ""porno"" in the title, she ain't going to want to do it. Then she heard that Seth was in it, and she heard that I was making it, and so she was like, well, I'll at least read it. She came over to my house and read it. And I remember, I was sitting downstairs while she was upstairs reading it, and I was like, if I could go back in time and tell the 16-year-old version of me that Traci Lords is going to be hanging out in your living room ... my 16-year-old head would explode. First, the 16-year-old would be like, where'd you get a time machine, and then the 16-year-old would be like, does she want to have sex with us, and then I'd have to break it to the 16-year-old that, no, Traci Lords -- even many years from now -- [is] still not interested in your fat ass. So, she loved the material. ... Maybe it's time to embrace it and make fun of it. I said yeah, please do it. Katie Morgan is still active in the adult film industry, and she brought a kind of a current vision to it. She was able to kind of tell me where to put the camera to make things look as convincing as possible. So I was like, wow, man, this chick who most people know from porn has taught me how to direct. So if the movie looks any better than my normal stuff, it's probably because of Katie Morgan. iReport.com: Will you see 'Zach and Miri'? CNN: The title has created some challenges in terms of the marketing, that some newspapers are not taking ads for it and some buses and what have you. What do you make of that? Smith: I think it's strange that in this day and age, the 21st century, that people are hung up on a word, and the word is ""porno."" It's not like we put salacious posters out there. ... The poster is literally stick figures. ... People are afraid like, what if my kid asks what porno is? Just tell them. Tell your kid that the porno's not for you. My kid asked me what a porno is, I'm going to be like, guess what? Hannah Montana is not in it. Not yet. Are you still interested? Of course she's not interested in it, because it has nothing to do with her world. So I just think its kind of sad that like some people lobby against it. Like, based on the dude who called in, or the many people that called in after the Dodgers ran a spot. ... Just tell your kid, man; just be honest with them. It's like, look, [the] movie's not for you. ... It's crazy to me, because it's like, some people think that it's real porn that's being advertised. Can you tell me the last porno that you saw that had the word ""porno"" in the title? Like, it doesn't exist. I don't think it's ever existed. CNN: I understand that you were able to convince the MPAA to give you an R rating. Did that require any cuts? And if not, were you surprised? Smith: Initially, I was kind of surprised that they gave us the NC-17. Especially because the two areas they focused on were easily addressed: one ... they felt [was] gratuitous thrusting in the first porno sequence between Katie Morgan and Jason Mewes, and the other was what we'll call the egregious bodily fluid shot. ... I was able to go to the appeals process with the film, where you show it to a different audience. ... [You] screen it for [theater owners], and then you get up and do 15 minutes on why you feel it should be an R. Joan Graves [of] the MPAA gets up and does 15 minutes on why she feels it's an NC-17, then you get 10 minutes to rebut, she gets 10 minutes to rebut. You leave the room, and that audience makes the vote. ... You have to win by a two-thirds majority [to have the rating changed]. And they changed the rating. [The] appeals group that we screened for ... flipped it, gave us an R. And I didn't have to make a single cut, so everything I wanted in the movie is in the movie. That's kind of cool as a filmmaker. CNN: Your own presidential debate. Smith: A little bit. ... It was kind of like ""Inherit the Wind,"" but about porn, not the Scopes Monkey Trial.","Kevin Smith is a fan of being bluntly honest .

"(CNN) -- I recently ran my first half-marathon, and among the cheering fans along the race course, I saw several holding signs that read, ""In our minds, you're all Kenyans."" I took it as a major compliment. Granted, in my wave of the race, there were mostly average runners, just trying to make the finish line, but the signs gave us a much-needed lift. Believe me, most endurance runners would love to be mentioned in the same sentence as any of Kenya's elite athletes. That's the appeal behind ""Running With the Kenyans,"" from author and runner Adharanand Finn. The book is out in paperback, and for my mileage, it's one of the best running reads in recent years. Fans who follow long-distance running are already familiar with Kenya's legendary success in the sport. Take a look at just about any major endurance race of the past 30 years, everything from the Boston Marathon to the World Cross Country Championships to the Summer Olympics, and you'll see runners from Kenya, men and women, standing on the winner's podium. So what's behind their winning ways? Finn, an experienced long-distance runner in his own right, is not the first person to ask this question. However, he was the first author to spend months in Kenya looking for the answer. Finn, his wife and their three small children left London on an incredible journey to spend six months in the small town of Iten, high in Kenya's Rift Valley province. It's ground zero for the country's elite runners. While there, Finn spent time at Kenya's elite training camps, running with everyone from Olympic champions to barefoot children. Kenya is filled with young hopefuls for whom running is not just a sport but a religion -- and for a lucky few, a path out of poverty. A champion runner can win thousands of dollars on the international race circuit. It's a pittance in comparison to the professional athletes who play sports such as football and basketball, but in Kenya, elite runners are celebrities who often live like royalty. It's a country of contrasts, producing many of the world's greatest runners while still beset by problems common to the Third World. Finn portrays Kenya in a realistic but positive light. Readers will see he enjoyed this life-changing experience and the people there immensely. And you've got to marvel at a country where one of the world's most prestigious marathons is delayed by lions on the race course. Safety first, people. When he's not on the trail or the track, Finn is a journalist at The Guardian. He recently talked to me about his book and his love of long-distance running. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: Did you learn the secret to what makes Kenyans such great runners? Adharanand Finn: Tempting as it was to boil the secret of the Kenyans down to one or two factors, in the end I had to be honest. The Kenyans are on another level when it comes to running. They genuinely are the greatest runners on earth. The only people with even a crumb of an argument against this are their East African neighbors, the Ethiopians. Between them they can run the legs off the rest of the world at every distance from 800 meters up. Yet, try as I might to find it, there was no single, all-conquering reason for their greatness. Nothing you could bottle, package up and say: Do this and you'll run like a Kenyan. Instead, up in the Rift Valley, a perfect combination of factors have all aligned to produce great runners. It's not only the altitude, nor the active childhoods (running miles to school barefoot each morning), nor the abundance of role models, nor the will to succeed, nor the lack of alternatives, nor the hard-work ethic, nor the culture of running that has grown up, nor the diet, nor all the other things I could mention. Instead, it is all of these things combined. CNN: What is your favorite memory of your time in Kenya? Finn: My favorite memories are of running in the midst of a group of Kenyans. Attempting such a thing was always a hair-raising experience, clinging on for my life as we wound our way faster and faster through the unknown countryside. But in those rare moments when I felt I could keep up, it was very special to be there, among them, our feet pounding the dusty road in unison, the sun rising in front of us, children standing sleepy-eyed at the doorways of their mud huts, rubbing their eyes, wondering if they'd just imagined that white man flashing by in the middle of the group. CNN: Have you kept in contact with the runners you met in Kenya? Finn: Yes. Some of them may not even have electricity or running water, but they all have Facebook. In fact I've organized for my former neighbor, Japhet, to come over to the UK in May to run the Edinburgh Marathon. I'll be there cheering him on and handing him his water bottle. CNN: Will the rest of the world ever catch up to Kenya in endurance running? Finn: They could. Great as the Kenyans are, their training is not very sophisticated. While this is in some ways their strength, people like U.S. coach Alberto Salazar are showing that if you use science and technology in the right way, and with the right people, you can get results. His two athletes, Mo Farah (from the United Kingdom) and Galen Rupp (from the United States), coming first and second in the 10,000-meter in the London Olympics, is testimony to that. CNN: What do you tell people when they ask you why you run? Finn: I usually shrug and say I don't know -- because unless you also run, it's hard for me to explain why I do it. It's like trying to describe the taste of a strawberry to someone who has never eaten one. It's much better to give them a strawberry to taste. But if pushed, I'll say it makes me feel happy, strong and alive. Not too many things can achieve that so easily. Read an excerpt from ""Running With the Kenyans"" Here are more recommended running reads: . ""Born to Run"" by Christopher McDougall . To many fans, this is the bible of barefoot running. McDougall's quest to heal a sore foot leads him on one of the most interesting paths ever taken by a running writer. His book is packed with informative detail about the science of running. It's also a compelling story of a 50-mile endurance race, held in one of the most remote spots on earth, Mexico's Copper Canyon. I was especially intrigued by his portrayal of the Tarahumara people, who are some of the world's greatest distance runners and especially ""Caballo Blanco,"" the mysterious loner who becomes McDougall's guide on this fascinating journey. ""Finding Ultra"" by Rich Roll . For anyone who has tried to lose weight or for athletes looking for a little inspiration, you'd be hard-pressed to do better than Roll's story of self-redemption. Roll tells how he went from promising college swimmer to alcoholic to overweight middle-aged father and eventually to becoming one of the fittest men on the planet. Roll transformed himself through self-discipline, rigorous training and a plant-based diet. There's plenty of fuel here for anyone interested in learning more about becoming vegan. What readers will really enjoy is following Roll in his quest to complete in Hawaii's Ultraman race, 320 miles of swimming, biking and running. It's a brutal event that would make even the toughest Ironman triathlete cry uncle. ""What I Talk About When I Talk About Running"" by Haruki Murakami . Who knew the Japanese author had run more marathons than he's written novels? For those counting, Murakami has reportedly run 25 marathons, including a 62-mile ultra-marathon and penned 13 novels to date. Like his surreal masterpiece, ""1Q84,"" Murakami's memoir on running is beautifully written, imaginative and ethereal. He also writes in absorbing detail about the pain, injuries and obsession that anyone who's ever run a 5K will recognize and sympathize with wholeheartedly.","Adharanand Finn traveled to Kenya to learn about the best runners in the world .

"(CNN) -- One of two men accused in a Canadian terror plot appeared to criticize the charges against him during a hearing Wednesday in Toronto, saying they were based on imperfect criminal law, not Islam's holy book. Chiheb Essegheier, 30, is accused in what authorities say was an al Qaeda-backed plot to target a passenger train. He waived the reading of the charges against him during the hearing Wednesday, telling Justice of the Peace Susan Hilton that ""all of these conclusions were based on the criminal code; it was not the holy book."" ""First of all, my comment is the following, because all of those conclusions was taken out based on Criminal Code, and all of us we know that this criminal code is not holy book; it's just written by set of creations, and the creations, they're not perfect, because only the creator is perfect, so if we are basing our judgment ... we cannot rely on the conclusions taken out from these judgments,"" he told Hilton. ""It doesn't matter in this court,"" Hilton responded. ""You save that for another court, speak to your counsels, take their advice from there."" The suspects planned to target a train crossing from the United States into Canada, according to a U.S. intelligence official and another government official. It was aimed at the New York-to-Toronto line that runs through Buffalo, another U.S. official said. Once the explosives went off, two of the officials said, the train would have careered off its tracks, causing major destruction. Instead, the suspects are behind bars after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced their arrest Monday. Alleged co-conspirator Raed Jaser is ""in a state of shock and disbelief,"" his lawyer John Norris said after his court appearance. He said his client is a permanent resident in Canada and has lived there for 20 years. ""He is anxious to see the evidence that the (government) says that it has against him,"" Norris said Tuesday. Both suspects face charges of conspiring ""to murder persons unknown ... for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a terrorist group,"" court records show. Authorities have not released much detail about the men, including their nationalities or how long they'd been in Canada, beyond that they were not Canadian citizens. University of Quebec spokeswoman Julie Martineau said Essegheier has been a doctoral student at the school since 2010. He was a student at the National Institute of Scientific Research and was conducting research on nanosensors, which are used primarily for medical treatments or to build other nanoproducts, she said. The suspects watched ""trains and railways in the greater Toronto area"" and intended to derail a passenger train, said Royal Canadian Mounted Police Chief Superintendent Jennifer Strachan. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp., quoting ""highly placed sources,"" reported that both had been under surveillance for more than a year. The FBI worked with Canadian authorities during the investigation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said. The terror plot, which a Canadian police official said on condition of anonymity wasn't linked to last week's deadly Boston Marathon bombings, was in its planning stages and not imminent. Still, the outlines are reminiscent of those found in a document seized during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. The document indicated that al Qaeda members discussed as early as 2010 a plan to derail trains in the United States by placing obstructions on tracks over bridges and in valleys, a law enforcement official told CNN in 2011. No specific rail system was identified, according to the source. Authorities believe the suspects received ""direction and guidance"" from elements of al Qaeda in Iran, said James Malizia, assistant commissioner for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. There's no evidence that the Iranian government was involved, he said. Iran denies that al Qaeda has any presence within its borders. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi told the country's state-run IRNA news agency that the allegation is ""the most ridiculous thing"" he has ever heard.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Even a grainy three-month-old video clip can stir up a controversy. A closed-circuit television clip, posted and shared on Chinese social media and reported by the local press this week, has triggered sympathy and outrage here in China. The footage purportedly shows a four-year-old girl with autism being manhandled and beaten by a female assistant at a children's rehabilitation center in the southern city of Guangzhou. The girl apparently collapsed and lost consciousness as other adults looked on passively. She was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment, Chinese media reports said. Watch: Footage of disturbing incident . Qiu Yaoyao (not her real name), an only child, has since undergone neurosurgery and is slowly recovering, a local Guangzhou newspaper reported last week. She can sit but she can't stand yet, the newspaper said, and her speaking ability is still impaired. The assistant in the video has been charged with assault and battery, media reports said, though CNN has not yet been able to verify this. Even though the incident happened three months ago, the newly uploaded video has sparked heated debate about the treatment of children -- particularly those with disabilities -- generating over 180,000 re-posts and 28,000 comments on one social media website alone. There is massive public outrage. Critics condemned the teacher's behavior, one calling it a ""bestial act."" Film actress Ma Yili took to Weibo, China's Twitter-like service, to say, ""This kind of behavior should be charged with intentional homicide. Autistic kids are extra vulnerable because they are unable to independently control their behavior. We as parents will be closely watching how (the teacher) will be punished in court."" Another Weibo user, named @Yaliju, asked, ""Doesn't she have a child herself? How on earth could kindergarten teachers be so cold-blooded? Who would dare entrust their kids to these peoples' hands?"" Other netizens blame the lack of trained teachers, especially for children with autism and other disabilities. ""This is heart-wrenching,"" posted @alwaysyouyou. ""And why were all the other teachers just standing there watching? I'm deeply worried about how teachers get their qualifications nowadays."" Still others question how Chinese children are reared and educated. Zheng Yuanjie, a writer of children's books, wrote on his microblog: ""Parents make so much effort to secure a slot for their kids in the kindergarten, but do they know what's happening behind closed doors once they get in? ""When I was in kindergarten, a kid accidentally dropped his bowl while eating. The teacher asked all other kids to take turns to slap him."" Like many places around the world, Chinese teachers and parents do resort to corporal punishment at times to discipline misbehaving children. But no one is defending the brutal treatment of Qiu Yaoyao. ""Surely it must be severely punished,"" wrote Zhang Jie, a commentator at China Central Television (CCTV) in a microblog post. ""The kindergarten and its supervisors must be held responsible too."" ""Educators should be more thoughtful in the way they discipline students. No matter what, corporal punishment in public will harm the students' self-esteem for sure,"" said Yang Jiangding, Director of the Shanghai Children's Research Center. Qiu Yaoyao's maltreatment has also put the spotlight on the plight of autistic children in China. Prevalence of autism in the world's most populous country, experts say, is largely underestimated because many Chinese doctors, parents and teachers typically do not know enough about the condition to be able to identify and diagnose it. Though awareness is growing and early intervention is improving, the social stigma remains strong. Read: What is autism? Autism in Chinese is known as ""zibizheng,"" literally ""self-isolation syndrome,"" or loneliness disease. It's a feeling shared by the parents of autistic children. ""I feel depressed and helpless I don't know how to deal with this,"" said Meng Xi in an interview with CNN. He said sometimes it seems his daughter barely knows he's there but the loving father said he is always there. He does not dare leave her side. Meng Xi brought his daughter to a special center for autistic children on the outskirts of Beijing. There, some 30 children, from toddlers to five and six years old, get specialized one-on-one care. Teachers use music and animal therapy to help unlock what could be inside the children's world. But these facilities are rare in China and parents and teachers complain of a lack of such facilities. The government helps subsidize the center, but parents still need to pay a lot of money for their children's special education. Meng Xi pays the equivalent of $500 a month -- almost his entire monthly salary. Autism is China's number one mental disorder, according to a research paper presented at the International Autism Research Conference in Shanghai last year. Yet a recent survey by the Shenzhen Autism Society in southern China reveals an alarming lack of professional or government support. The brutal treatment of four-year-old Qiu Yaoyao, shockingly captured in that grainy closed-circuit television clip, is a grim reminder of that.","Footage purportedly shows four-year-old girl with autism being manhandled and beaten .

"(CNN) -- Scores of insurgents have been killed over the last day during fighting in southern Afghanistan, the U.S.-led coalition said on Wednesday. U.S. soldiers pass by Afghan policemen as they stand guard at a checkpoint near the partly-ruined Darlaman Palace in Kabul. Afghan and coalition troops have killed an estimated 104 insurgents in ongoing fighting since Tuesday morning near the Musa Qalah Wadi in Helmand province, the coalition said. A coalition service member was killed and four others were wounded in the fighting between troops and Taliban militants. In neighboring Uruzgan province, a battle between Taliban militants and troops Tuesday left more than 65 insurgents dead in a six-hour battle. The Afghan-coalition patrol had been near the same spot, northeast of Deh Rawod, where more than three dozen insurgents preparing an ambush were killed last week. ""As with our forces near Musa Qalah, this operation is intended to deny the enemies of peace the use of Deh Rawod as a safe haven,"" said Army Maj. Chris Belcher, a Combined Joint Task Force-82 spokesman. ""Much like last week's engagement, last night's overwhelming victory by ANSF against the extremists is one more example of this strategy to secure a stable and safe living area for the residents of  province.""

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Thirty-three people have now died from the MERS coronavirus, the World Health Organization said Friday. Three new cases, including a fatality, were recorded in Saudi Arabia, the kingdom announced this week. Another previously reported Saudi Arabian patient also died from the disease, which lacks a cure or vaccine. Globally, there have been 58 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS, and all have been linked to the Middle East. A statement from the Saudi Ministry of Health said one of three new cases was a 21-year-old man who died after being admitted into intensive care this week. Health officials haven't revealed more details about the young man or whether he had an underlying health condition. The majority of serious illness and deaths have been seen in old, already sick men. The other two cases, according to the health ministry, were in Saudi Arabia's eastern governorate of Al-Ahsa, where most cases of the disease have appeared. One is a 63-year-old Saudi woman who is in stable condition; a 75-year-old man remains in intensive care. The Saudi Arabia ministry announcement Wednesday came a day after the ministry said it had made progress in its research to combat the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak. Studies carried out by researchers from Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom have allowed them to map out the genetic characteristics of the MERS virus, the health ministry said in a statement. This is considered ""a positive step to follow-up the development and mutation of the virus over the time, meanwhile, helping in the diagnostic steps, and to find out a quick mechanism of diagnoses,"" the ministry said. The research was conducted in collaboration with scientists from University College London and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. A full genetic series, obtained from four infected cases in Al-Ahsa, was recorded in the gene bank, said ministry spokesman Dr. Khalid Marghlani. The series is also available to the public on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. The ministry said it ""hopes that this step to contribute to the scientific development; so as to accelerate finding out a vaccine for this disease, and to learn more about this the virus, since there is hardly current information about it up to now, nor there is a vaccine or treatment for it."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it is ""important that the Saudis released the sequences. It helps us understand the virologic evidence of person-to-person transmission."" The virus could be adapting to better grow and cause disease in humans, said Dr. Mark Denison, a professor of pediatrics and longtime coronavirus researcher at Vanderbilt University. Releasing the genetic sequences from four more patients and making them publicly available is essential for allowing researchers around the world to study this emerging disease. Researchers can now start comparing the genetic sequences from these four recent Saudi patients to the genetic sequence from the first Saudi patient, which is also publicly available, he said. ""It may give us insights into why the epidemic is continuing"" and whether the virus is changing. While the overall number of cases is limited, MERS has been fatal in more than half of patients, according to the WHO. Despite concerns about this new virus, there is ""no evidence of widespread person-to-person transmission,"" according tothe WHO. Cases where it was passed from person to person resulted from close contact between an infected person and someone else. In addition, fewer MERS infections have been seen in health care workers than during the SARS epidemic, the WHO said. But the international organization called for caution, saying it is possible for the virus to move around the world. CNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","The WHO says 58 cases of MERS have been reported; 33 have died .
Researchers have mapped the genetic characteristics of the virus .
While cases are limited, MERS has killed more than half of its victims ."
"(CNN) -- Another top team official has been implicated in Indian cricket's corruption scandal, which centers around illegal gambling on the country's popular Twenty20 tournament. After last month's arrest of Gurunath Meiyappan -- formerly on the management staff of Indian Premier League team the Chennai Super Kings -- for his alleged involvement in betting in this year's competition, an IPL team owner is now under police radar. Raj Kundra, a co-owner of Rajasthan Royals along with his Bollywood actress wife Shilpa Shetty, has been interrogated by Delhi Police for his alleged role in spot-fixing -- a practice which involves prearranging certain incidents to occur during a match. After a 12-hour interview Thursday, police officials claimed Kundra has admitted to betting and said they have confiscated his passport while the investigation continues. ""During police interrogation, Kundra admitted to betting on his own team, Rajasthan Royals,"" Delhi Police commissioner Neeraj Kumar told CNN. ""He used to do so through his aide Umesh Goenka, a bookie. According to our information he also lost a large amount of money in betting."" However, Kumar said Kundra cannot be arrested as police don't yet have ""prosecutable evidence against him."" Police have also learned about the possible involvement of Shetty, but have yet to decide if she will be questioned. The couple has an 11.7% stake in the Royals worth a reported $15 million. The Royals issued a joint statement from franchise chairman Ranjit Barthakur and CEO Raghu Iyer saying they are ""cooperating with the authorities to ensure a thorough inquiry."" ""Mr. Raj Kundra is a minority shareholder, and he has no involvement in the running of the franchise,"" they said. ""We believe that Mr. Raj Kundra is a law-abiding citizen and would not act contrary to law. If however, he is proven guilty, or has breached any regulations, he will be suspended, and he will also forfeit his shares."" Kundra also released a statement, insisting: ""I have done no wrong for which I need to have any regrets."" ""I satisfactorily replied to the queries raised by the police and they accordingly allowed me to leave after my questioning,"" he said. ""However as the case develops, in due process, it may become necessary for the police to question me further. ""I have not committed any wrong and am myself extremely anxious to know the whole truth. If an iota of wrongdoing is finally established against me I would unhesitatingly forfeit my share in the franchise."" After Kundra's alleged confession to his involvement in IPL match-fixing, Indian cricket's ruling body -- the BCCI -- has convened an emergency working committee meeting of its board in New Delhi on June 10. While betting/gambling is a bailable offense under CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure), BCCI rules are rather stringent. According to Clause 11.3 (c) of BCCI-IPL Franchisee agreement, any act of the owner that brings the Board or IPL to disrepute will call in for annulment of agreement with the franchisee. When questioned whether Rajasthan Royals will be terminated from IPL, the BCCI's interim chief Jagmohan Dalmiya told reporters: ""Raj Kundra's issue would be discussed in the working committee to be held on June 10 after we look into the details. If it demands any strict action we will look into it."" The arrest of Meiyappan caused big concern for the BCCI as he is the son-in-law of its president Narayanaswami Sreenivasan, who is the Chennai team principal. Sreenivasan has stood down from his BCCI role while the investigation continues. Meanwhile, a Mumbai court Friday adjourned the bail plea of Indian cricketer Shanthakumaran Sreesanth until Monday. He had approached the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA) Court after a Delhi court rejected his bail plea and extended his judicial custody until June 18. Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila were the first cricketers to be arrested in the IPL spot-fixing case. All three have played for Rajasthan Royals. Another controversy has clouded Indian cricket, with national team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni being accused of having a conflict of interest for having stakes in the sports management company, Rhiti Sports. It also handles accounts for his fellow India internationals Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja and Pragyan Ojha. The firm has denied that Dhoni has stakes in the company. When quizzed about the BCCI's take on Dhoni's alleged conflict of interest issues, Dalmiya said: ""We will not cover up Dhoni's links with Rhiti Sports, if any. But at this point when the team is busy with Champions Trophy (in England). We will not achieve anything by disturbing the atmosphere.""","Senior Indian Premier League figures arrested over illegal betting .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Eight female badminton players were disqualified from the Olympics this week for apparently trying to throw their matches to secure a favorable draw. It's not the first time sports people have tried to improve their chances of winning, but is deliberately trying to lose a match smart tactics or disguised cheating? Two of the players involved were reigning world champions, Wang Xiaoli and Yu Yang, who were considered gold medal contenders for China. China's sports officials quickly accepted the punishment and players apologized publicly, although Yu subsequently suggested she was quitting the sport. Soon after the badminton controversy broke it was the top-trending topic on Weibo, China's most popular micro-blogging site, with over 15 million posts. Read more: Badminton players disqualified for trying to lose . Many cried foul, saying the athletes' behavior was a disgraceful breach of the Olympic code and was disrespectful of the spectators who paid money to watch the world's best athletes do their best. One blogger said: ""Whatever purpose their behavior may be, it shows a loss of sports ethics."" But others defended the players and blamed badminton's competition rules. Win or lose, observers noted, all four pairs had already qualified for the next round. In the two separate matches, they played perfunctorily to lose so they could avoid facing their own teammates, or the top seeds, in the next round of competition. ""The rules are irrational,"" one blogger wrote. ""You can't blame those who adopt a flexible strategy."" Another blogger said: ""I feel sympathy for the players because they have worked so hard and their dreams ended in London."" Read more: London Olympics special . Soon after her disqualification, Yu Yang, only 26 years old, said she was quitting badminton. ""This is my last match,"" she wrote in a micro-blog to her 1.3 million followers. ""Farewell, my beloved badminton."" The next day, Yu Yang said sorry. ""I apologize to all our fans because we failed to abide by the Olympic spirit,"" she said. ""I am ready to do my best in every game of my professional career in future."" It's unclear if Yu Yang is retiring, but the badminton flap has reopened one nagging debate in sports: is it fair to intentionally lose for tactical advantage? ""This is simple stratagem,"" argued blogger qingchengweiliang. ""Any country would adopt it if they could. "" To be sure, similar controversy has hit other sports. In a World Cup match in 1982, West Germany quickly led Austria, 1-0 and the teams perfunctorily kicked the ball around the field for nearly 80 minutes. Why? Because they knew that the outcome would allow both teams to advance in the next round of competition. The infamous match later prompted the World Cup to revise its rules so that the final matches in group stage are played at the same time. It's not the first time Chinese sports teams have intentionally lost games to gain advantage. I remember a controversy in the late 1980s. Playing at the World Championship in 1986, table tennis star He Zhili was instructed by her coaches to throw her semifinal match against a team mate, a defensive player, because they concluded that she stood a better chance than He to beat a South Korean in the final. But He Zhili ignored the instructions and went on to beat her teammate and, a match later, the South Korean. Partly because of her insubordination, He was dropped from China's three-woman Olympic team in 1988. The incident triggered little controversy. Chinese athletes typically abide by the idea of ""organization discipline,"" which expects them to subordinate personal gain and fame to the team'sâ€”and the Motherland'sâ€”interest. A similar incident involved the Chinese badminton team at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, says a report by the Sina.com sports. When a Danish player trounced her Chinese opponent in the women's singles semifinals, the Chinese team officials asked coach Chen Peide to convince top player Ye Zhaoying to drop her semifinal match to teammate Gong Zhichao because they thought Gong had a better chance of beating the Dane. Ye reluctantly agreed. In the end, Gong won the gold medal and Ye the bronze. Years later, coach Chen recalled how badly he felt about the episode. ""After we returned to China, I repeatedly praised Ye Zhaoying,"" he said. ""Still it's difficult to make up for it."" Chen said: ""Many times national interest and the Olympic spirit are not contradictory, but sometimes they unavoidably clash. Should national interest be above everything, or should it be the Olympic spirit? This should make everyone ponder."" The badminton controversy in London has triggered heated debate in China, with many people challenging the ""gold-is-everything"" mentality in Chinese sports. Some blame the lure of fame, cash and commercial endorsements that often come after the Olympic athletes' gold medal performances. ""Is this all athlete's fault? Not really,"" wrote a Xinhua correspondent, who blamed China's sports system of apportioning medals among players because, ""apart from the coaches, sports officials and administrators (who supervise the winning athletes) will also be rewarded when athletes win gold medals."" On China's Weibo, the hot topic in recent days has been ""No gold medal, still a hero."" I see a hint of change. In the men's table tennis singles final match on Thursday, Wang Hao, 28, twice a silver medalist in two previous Olympics, faced compatriot Zhang Jike, 24, the reigning world champion. It's a gold medal in the bag for the Chinese team. If this played out several years ago, my guess is, the Chinese team would probably have decided before the match that Wang Hao should get the gold to top off his impressive but always-a-bridesmaid-never-the-bride career. Instead, the two paddlers seemingly played for gold, entertaining the London spectators with their spinning serves and furious smashes. Zhang Jike won the match 4-1â€”and the Olympic gold. Zhang is now hailed as China's new Olympic star, but the Chinese media is also heaping praise on the loser, Wang Hao.","Olympic badminton flap raises questions about seeking favorable draws .

"(CNN) -- One hundred and sixty-five years ago, in Coloma, California, a carpenter named James W. Marshall built a sawmill to harness the power of the American River. Below the waterwheel, he saw flakes of metal where the spent water flowed. Marshall marked the moment saying, ""I have found it."" He had discovered gold in California and more: For the next century, our nation would mine its future in the Golden State. By the 1950s, California had manufactured an optimistic nation's dreams, brought them to life in the steel and smoke of industry and then captured them on celluloid. Business bloomed in deserts, nourishing one of the world's great economies. A green Eden of farmland, the Central Valley where the sun shone 300 days a year, grew one third of America's produce. Innovation followed discovery: Silicon, it turned out, was even more valuable than gold. California's public sector also boomed. The state built a web of roads, bridges and aqueducts that shamed their Roman inventors. It funded world-class universities to prepare beach boys and California girls for lives of endless promise. To see where the rest of the country would be in 20 years, we could look at California. But the roads to success and failure are often almost the same. As the state gorged on its success, California's transportation arteries grew clogged. The public sector's blood began to thicken. Californians moved faster, their problems grew more complex and their demands on government accelerated. The state's aging public sector could not respond with matching dynamism and flexibility. Even as the state poured more money into education, transportation and public safety, it delivered less value in them. Government grew larger and more expensive, with less and less to show for it. Finally, when the housing bubble collapsed, state revenue did too. California's river of gold dried up. The waterwheel would not turn. Today, California owes hundreds of billions: $300 billion alone in pension obligations. Even after Gov. Jerry Brown's effort to pay down $28 billion of immediate debt, California's liabilities for retiree pensions and health care exceed what it spends for all state programs combined. California's future looks anything but golden. Taxpayers who don't want to be left footing the bills are in exodus. The state's politics is as paralyzing as Washington's. To see our nation's bright future in 20 years, can we still look at California? Maybe so. Sometimes, the first green shoots emerge in the forest where everything burned. --- . Gavin Newsom is difficult to classify. Tall, slim and rakishly elegant, he could be the American reincarnation of British actor David Niven. A contradictory combination of left and right, he is a liberal hero for legalizing gay marriage in his city and a liberal villain for reforming its overly generous welfare cash payment program. The 45-year-old Newsom, a Democrat who is now California's lieutenant governor, is more than a government theorist, however. He owns 17 small businesses with about 1,000 employees. His confederation includes three wineries that make luscious, fruit-forward elixirs. In business, he is a swashbuckling entrepreneur whose motto is ""anyone who is not failing isn't trying hard enough."" What is most revolutionary about Newsom is that in government, he's an entrepreneur as well. When Newsom became mayor of San Francisco, he found a city with little money to meet social needs and behind Estonia and South Korea in digital governance. His push to modernize San Francisco without expanding its dysfunctional public sector is the launching point of his new book, ""Citizenville."" It is a fertile garden of original thinking. The lieutenant governor argues that government's biggest problem is not that it is misguided but that it is archaic. Newsom cites open-source software pioneer Tim O'Reilly's analogy for government. ""We think of government as a vending machine: You put money in, services come out."" When something goes wrong, Newsom points out, we shake the vending machine out of frustration. If we feed it more money, it is to little effect: Vending machines are not particularly innovative or adaptive. Our government is still built on that model, Newsom reports, the outdated, industrial-age paradigm of the factory, though everything else in our personal lives and our private sector has moved past it. Simultaneously, an explosion of technology, social media and e-commerce has created a more informed and empowered citizenry. A ""citizenville,"" Newsom writes, now has the power and connectivity to solve problems in new ways, e.g., determining where tax dollars are spent, how crime is fought and where garbage trucks go. Speaking through their laptops and iPhones, people are increasingly able to organize themselves and solve social problems, independent of the old, creaky, public-sector industrial plant. ""Technology changes the very nature of government -- from a top-down entity to a bottom-up one. From one-way hierarchy to two-way democracy. From vending machine to the cloud,"" he explains. If we open the doors of government to the private sector and make data accessible, we can jump-start a new era of social innovation. Open up the doors of government satellite data and you get Google Earth. Give Web designers in Chicago and Oakland access to public police data, and they create innovative crime-mapping tools that prevent muggings. Invent a digital ""currency"" to reward citizens for participating in their own governance, and small town decision-making becomes as interesting and involving as Farmville. ""The future is sharing -- open data, open participation, open source, open everything,"" Newsom writes. ""And it must happen at every level."" Our old, marbled shrines to bureaucracy have grown unserviceable and unaffordable. Can we continue to justify them when mayors are using Twitter to address constituent needs instead? The lesson: The public sector no longer has a monopoly on government. We are in a new world of revolutionary and empowering technologies. Americans aren't waiting for Washington or Sacramento to reinvent government for the next century; they are creating an app for that. With it, they are creating a new path for democratic vitality. Now, people-to-people government is an alternative to one that flowed only to people from the state. With new tools and technologies, Newsom contends, it is time to redefine ""government"" to seize the opportunities of a new day. Would we still rather be governed the old way, top down, politically and artificially by plant managers? Or bottom-up, authentically, naturally and organically, through our own decision making and handiwork? Perhaps this has been the promise of the American experiment in self-government all along, and we have only been waiting for the powerful and democratizing technology of the communications age to seize it. Once more, when we need it most, maybe California has discovered gold again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Castellanos.","Calif. Lt. Gov.

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- First, Justin Stoner blew the whistle on his platoon. Now, the Army apparently wants to silence him. In photos obtained by CNN, Stoner sports bruises and abrasions on his back, chest and near his neck -- the marks of a beating inflicted by fellow soldiers as payback for reporting their rampant hashish use, the Army said. At the time, those close to the investigation tell CNN, Stoner just wanted the smoking in his tent and around him to stop. So he went outside his group and reported the drug use to his superiors. But that move, and the subsequent beating he endured for being viewed as a snitch, triggered a wide-ranging criminal investigation that has left some soldiers accused of killing innocent Afghan civilians and others accused of posing in gruesome photos with the dead or keeping body parts as war trophies. Now the Army is doing everything it can to limit the publicity its own explosive account created. Stoner, a private first class now back in the United States, had agreed to speak with CNN about the torment he went through at the hands of fellow soldiers earlier this year. But just three hours before the interview was to take place in Seattle, CNN received this e-mail from his military attorney, Capt. Ernesto Gapasin, Jr., abruptly pulling the plug on the scheduled interview: . ""About two hours ago, prosecutors and I met re [regarding] the disposition of the case against PFC Stoner,'' the attorney wrote. ""Based on this meeting, PFC Stoner will be given full immunity in this case and not be prosecuted for any allegations made against him, contingent also however, on staying away from the media."" The Army disputes that account, however, saying Stoner has not been given immunity. ""Discussing PFC Stoner's direct involvement in these hearings is inappropriate and could affect the outcome of these cases,"" Lt. Col. David P. Doherty, a spokesman for the Army's I Corps, told CNN in a statement issued Thursday. ""It is imperative that we follow the judicial process in order to provide the accused a fair and impartial trial, while at the same time serve justice,"" Doherty said. ""PFC Stoner is currently not charged in these matters, nor has he been granted immunity by the convening authority for his cooperation in these ongoing investigations."" What is clear is the Army is scrambling to contain the news of an apparently out-of-control platoon. The portrait of rogue soldiers at a forward operating base in Afghanistan has been painted by the Army itself in chilling charge sheets leveled at 12 members of the 5th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, based out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord outside Tacoma, Washington. Five of the dozen are charged with pre-meditated murder in what investigators call the ""staged"" killings of three civilian Afghans. Those soldiers and the others face various other charges as well from unlawful use of illicit drugs, possession of a human skull, fingers and leg bones to the assault on Stoner. Two directives have been sent to military and civilian attorneys representing the Stryker dozen. They involve grisly photos allegedly showing dead bodies and body parts, and soldiers posing as if they had killed a deer on a hunt. One of the orders commanded military defense attorneys to return all ""documents inadvertently provided by the government"" on September 9. The marked exhibits, lawyers told CNN, correspond to the photos. A number of lawyers have told CNN the photos are worse than those that depicted humiliating poses of Iraqi prisoners at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison. Those photos sparked outrage and riots in parts of the world. Another directive apparently was meant for civilian attorneys and not only pointedly ordered the return of photos but further said defense and prosecution teams could only view them at Lewis-McChord. Lawyer Dan Conway, who represents Pfc. Andrew Holmes, told CNN the order makes it difficult to represent their client, because it prohibits them from forensic testing and they are housed in many cases thousands of miles from where the lawyers are based. Other attorneys have similarly complained to CNN that the Army is tying their hands in defending their clients to avoid more embarrassment. Holmes is charged with premeditated murder in a January killing. Conway said his client is innocent of the charges and was denied representation for 20 days, despite repeatedly asking for an attorney while still in Afghanistan. Both orders were signed by Col. Barry H. Higgins, the brigade's commander. The second directive reads, in part: ""Further I order that all such images may not be distributed to any persons outside of personnel assigned to CID. 'Human Casualties' are defined as dead, wounded or injured human beings to include separated body parts, organs, and biological materials, resulting from either combat or non-combat activities.'' Even without those photos surfacing, much has already leaked out about the case, spurred in no small part by the Army's release and description of grisly details in the charging documents. And the headlines around the world about the rogue unit have created a backlash in a part of the world where the Army desperately hopes to win over hearts and minds. The beating of Stoner and the murders of Afghans apparently just for sport and then staged to look like combat casualties- have been highlighted by some of the accused soldiers' whose own words captured on interrogation tapes obtained by CNN. Tapes describe killings for sport . In one of those videotaped sessions, Cpl. Jeremy Morlock -- who has been charged in all three of the killings -- recounts how he and several other soldiers deliberately ambushed Stoner on May 5. ""So yeah, we walked into the room and locked the door behind us and a couple guys started talking to him, laying on him,"" Morlock told investigators. Asked by investigator what he meant, Morlock replied, ""Why would you rat out your guys, stuff like that."" He said Stoner initially denied he went to superiors, then admitted it as he was being confronted by their squad leader, Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs. ""I think someone had grabbed him at that point and maybe punched him in the chest or something,"" Morlock said on the tape. ""He then made a comment like you guys can sit here and punch me all day long if you want and once he said that, Gibbs was like OK, grabbed him off his cot and threw him on the ground in his room and that's when a few guys got some licks in."" Morlock's attorney, Michael Waddington, said his client was on prescription drugs from the Army, high on hashish and suffering combat-related injuries when the crimes were committed. The Army has recommended Morlock be court-martialed. Gibbs' attorney said he is not ready to comment on the case. But Gibbs has been charged with the most crimes, and is depicted in the interrogation tapes made by some of the accused and in witness statements as the ringleader who reveled in his kills and dropped three human fingers in front of Stoner after the beating. Other soldiers told investigators that Gibbs liked to collect fingers, teeth and leg bones as souvenirs. Gibbs is also suspected of being a skinhead who kept track of his ""kills"" with skull tattoos on his leg. Reports show Army sgt. tracked kills with tattoos . CNN has obtained investigators' photos of the tattoos clearly showing skulls and cross bones. One soldier, not charged, said Gibbs ""associates with skinheads online. ""It's scary because they are worse than most gang members I've met,"" the soldier told investigators. The photos are included in over 1,000 pages of evidence compiled by the Army and turned over to attorneys. They include witnesses' statements and depict a platoon where Gibbs ruled -- and anyone who didn't follow his rules believed they could end up like Stoner. ""I take that man very seriously,"" Spc. Adam Winfield told investigators in his videotaped confession. ""He likes to kill things. He is pretty much evil incarnate. I mean I have never met a man who can go from one minute joking around then mindless killings. I mean he likes to kill things."" Winfield is charged with premeditated murder in a May killing of an Afghan civilian whose death was made to look like a hostile enemy battlefield death. His lawyer, Eric Montalvo, said his client is not guilty of premeditated murder despite what his client told investigators on the videotaped interrogation. The Army is now investigating claims by Winfield's father, Christopher Winfield, that it ignored his attempts to warn them about Gibbs. Warning may have been ignored . The elder Winfield told CNN that his son alerted him after the first killing, and he said two more men died needlessly after that because the Army would not listen to his warnings. In addition, the Army reportedly is re-examining Gibbs' role in the 2004 shooting of two adults and a child in Iraq, near the city of Kirkuk. The shooting involved a car which purportedly was swerving towards a uniformed patrol. Spc. Michael Wagnon is the fifth member of the Stryker platoon charged with premeditated murder. His attorney, Colby Vokey, said his client is innocent. The Army, meanwhile, seems to have decided to let the charging documents be its official comment. ""I don't want to do anything that could in any way jeopardize the prosecution or their ability of the defendants in this case to get a fair trial, "" Geoff Morell, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters October 5. -- CNN's Todd Schwarzschild, Courtney Yager and Scott Zamost contributed to this report .

"(CNN) -- For those following the Confederations Cup game on television around the world, Brazil's 2-0 victory over Mexico in the north-eastern city of Fortaleza seemed a routine affair. Brazil's latest number 10, Neymar, dazzled while scoring one goal and setting up the second in a stadium bedecked with yellow-shirted fans as the hosts continued their serene progress in Group A. The hosts will match up against Italy for top spot in the group table after the Azzurri beat Japan 4-3, eliminating the Blue Samurai from semifinal contention. The loser of the Brazil and Italy game will likely draw Spain in the semifinals. At the Brazil-Mexico game, not all the action was on the pitch. A closer look around the stadium revealed numerous placards railing against corruption, social injustice, high taxes and even some requesting that FIFA bring hospitals to Brazil rather than stadiums. And outside the Castelao stadium, newly built at a cost of $240 million, it was anything but normal as protesters blocked roads in such numbers they forced a number of vehicles, including some containing FIFA passengers, to take a different route to the arena. Brazil has been rocked by the biggest demonstrations seen in over two decades this week as protests initially sparked by a hike in bus fares in Sao Paulo have spiraled into nationwide marches. Protesters have decried the $15 billion being invested in the Confederations Cup, the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games while outlining the need for improvements in hospitals, transportation, education and other key social programs. With Brazil gripped by what is being called the ""Tropical Spring"", it seemed apt that the golden hope for the national team - one who supposedly can bring about a brighter future himself - set the hosts on their way. ""Saddened by all that is occurring in Brazil,"" Neymar, 21, wrote in a statement issued before kickoff. ""I always had faith that it would not be necessary to come to the point of having to take to the streets to demand better conditions for transport, health, education and security. All this is the OBLIGATION of the government."" Just hours later, the politically disillusioned Neymar brought great joy to his 200 million compatriots as he opened the scoring against the Mexicans with a fine volley -- firing home from just inside the box with his left foot, just days after a beauty against Japan with his right. The ball fell to the new Barcelona signing after a cross from right back Dani Alves, who had given his backing to the widespread protests in the run up to the game. ""Order and Progress without violence for a better Brazil, a peaceful Brazil, an educated, healthy, honest and happy Brazil,"" he wrote on his Instagram account. While the protestors face an indeterminate wait to see what effect their actions will have, Brazil's football fans can rest a little easier after the five-time world champions reached the verge of the Confederations Cup semifinals. Victory was sealed when Neymar, who had taken his tally to 13 goals in 15 internationals, shimmied his way between two defenders in stoppage time to set up substitute Jo for the second goal. Despite the protests, the players arrived at the stadium in relaxed mood -- Neymar tapping away at a tambourine while squad member Dante was among several banging a drum. Brazil's victory went some way to redressing their poor run against Mexico, who boast a better recent record against their opponents than any other side in the world - with six wins from 11 meetings. But Mexico, who won the 1999 Confederations Cup when beating the Brazilians 4-3 on home soil and took Olympic gold when defeating the South Americans at London 2012, could not find a way past a defense that looked ragged at times. Having beaten Japan 3-0 in their opener on Saturday, Brazil have maximum from two games -- with their final Group A clash coming against Italy on Saturday in Salvador.","Neymar scores one and makes the other as hosts Brazil beat Mexico 2-0 in Group A .

"(CNN) -- Most of what you read or hear in mass media about President Hugo Chavez is always negative, his faults exaggerated, his discourse distorted and his achievements ignored. The reality is quite different. Hugo Chavez was beloved by millions around the world. He changed the course of a continent and led a collective awakening of a people once silenced, once exploited and ignored. Chavez was a grandiose visionary and a maker of dreams. An honest man from a humble background who lived in a mud hut as a child and sold candies on the streets to make money for his family, Chavez dreamed of building a strong, sovereign nation, independent of foreign influence and dignified on the world scene. He dreamed of improving the lives of his people, of eradicating the misery of poverty and of offering everyone the chance of a better life -- the ""good life"" (el buenvivir), as he called it. President Chavez made those dreams come true. During his nearly 14 years of governance, elected to three full six-year terms but only serving two due to his untimely death, Chavez's policies reduced extreme poverty in Venezuela by more than 75%, from 25% to less than 7% in a decade, according to statistics from the Center for Economic and Policy Research. And overall poverty was reduced by more than 50%, from 60% in 1998 when Chavez first won office to 27% by 2008. What's next? Chavez's death leaves many questions . This is not just numbers, this translates into profound changes in the lives of millions of Venezuelans who today eat three meals a day, own their homes and have jobs or access to financial aid. But the dreams don't stop there. Chavez dreamed of a nation filled with educated, healthy people, and so he established free, quality public education from preschool through doctoral studies, accessible to all. In fact, for those in remote areas or places without educational facilities, schools were built and mobile educational facilities were created to bring education to the people. Chavez also created a national public health system offering universal, free health care to all, with the help and solidarity of Cuba, which sent thousands of doctors and medical workers to provide quality services to the Venezuelan people, many who had never received medical care in their lives. To strengthen and empower communities, Chavez propelled policies of inclusion and participatory governance, giving voice to those previously excluded from politics. He created grassroots community councils and networks to attend to local needs in neighborhoods across the nation, placing the power to govern in the joint hands of community groups. Opinion: Chavez used force of personality to win votes, influence leaders . His vision of diversifying his nation and developing its full potential transformed into railways, new industries, satellite cities and innovative transport, such as MetroCable Cars soaring high into the mountains of Caracas to connect people in their steep hillside homes with the bustling city. The centuries-old dream of Independence hero Simon Bolivar to build a unified ""Patria Grande"" (Grand Homeland) in South America became Chavez's guiding light and he held it high, illuminating the path he paved. Chavez was a driving force in unifying Latin America, creating new regional organizations like the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). These entities have embraced integration, cooperation and solidarity as their principal method of exchange, rejecting competition, exploitation and domination, the main principles of U.S. and western foreign policy. Chavez inspired a 21st century world to fight for justice, to stand with dignity before bullying powers that seek to impose their will on others. He raised his voice when no others would and had no fear of consequence, because he knew that truth was on his side. Opinion: Chavez empowered the poor, divided a nation . Chavez was a maker of dreams. He recognized the rights of the disabled, of indigenous peoples, all genders and sexualities. He broke down barriers of racism and classism and declared himself a socialist feminist. He not only made his own dreams come true, but he inspired us all to achieve our fullest potential. Don't get me wrong, things are not perfect in Venezuela by any stretch, but no one can honestly deny that they are much better than before Hugo Chavez became president. And no one could deny that President Hugo Chavez was larger than life. The first time I flew on President Chavez's airplane, he invited me to breakfast in his private room. It was just me and him. I was nervous and felt anxious and rushed to tell him about the results of my investigations into the United States government's role in the coup d'etat against him in 2002. Chavez leaves a revolutionary legacy . After all, that's why I was on the plane in the first place. I had been invited to participate in his regular Sunday television show, Alo Presidente (Hello Mr. President) to present the hundreds of declassified documents I had obtained from U.S. government agencies through the Freedom of Information Act that exposed U.S. funding of coup participants. The date was April 11, 2004, exactly two years after the coup that nearly killed him and sent the nation into spiraling chaos. (Editor's Note: The U.S. government denied involvement in the 2002 coup.) As I began pulling out papers and spreading documents on the table that separated us, he stopped me. ""Have you had breakfast yet?"" he asked. ""No,"" I said, and continued fiddling with the revealing paper before me. ""We can discuss that later,"" he said. ""For now, tell me about yourself. How is your mother?"" he asked me, as though we were old friends. A flight attendant came through the door of his private room with two trays and placed them on the table. I quickly gathered up the documents. ""Let's eat,"" he said. I started to protest, trying to explain that his time was so limited I wanted to take advantage of every minute. He stopped me and said: ""This is a humble breakfast, a breakfast from the barracks, what I most love."" I looked at the tray for the first time. On it was a small plate with an arepa, a typical Venezuelan corn patty, a few shreads of white cheese, a couple of pieces of canteloupe and some anchovies. Beside the plate was a small cup of black coffee. No frills and not what you would expect on a presidential airplane. ""After all, I am just a soldier,"" he added. Yes, Chavez, you are a soldier, a glorious soldier of a dignified, proud and kind people. And you are a maker of dreams for millions around the world. Chavez leaves Venezuelan economy more equal, less stable .","Eva Golinger says Hugo Chavez reduced poverty for millions of Venezuelans .

"(CNN) -- The Cleveland man accused of keeping three women captive in his home for a decade learned Wednesday the prosecution is seeking more indictments in the case. Shackled and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, Ariel Castro, 52, kept his head down for the eight-minute hearing, often closing his eyes and speaking only to answer ""yes"" or ""no"" to the judge's questions. Cuyahoga County Judge Michael Russo set the next pretrial hearing for June 26 and told the prosecution and defense that any plea deal would need to be in writing. The defense has said in the past that it would be open to a plea deal if the death penalty was taken off the table. Castro's lawyers have also filed a speedy-trial motion, which would mean the case would have to begin by the date listed, August 4. However, that deadline could change if Castro's attorneys change course and ask for more time to prepare for the case. Prosecutor Timothy McGinty told Russo there is a possibility of more charges. ""We are presenting additional evidence to the grand jury next week and the week after. We expect we are going to request further indictments to cover the additional period,"" he said. Castro faces 329 counts, including one count of aggravated murder for allegedly causing the unlawful termination of a pregnancy. This week, Castro entered a not guilty plea to all charges, including 139 counts of rape and 177 counts of kidnapping Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus. Castro fathered a daughter with Berry, according to authorities. Police have alleged Knight was impregnated by Castro five times, but he would punch her in the stomach, resulting in miscarriages and termination of all the pregnancies. Authorities said last week they are conducting DNA tests on evidence to determine if additional victims were inside Castro's Cleveland home, and the state attorney general's office says the crime lab is reviewing additional evidence in the case. Since the case began, investigators have been looking for evidence of aborted fetuses and evidence of any other girls or women who may have been kidnapped or held captive in the house. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","Ariel Castro keeps his head down, eyes closed through most of hearing .

"(CNN) -- Burkino Faso have been cleared to participate in the Africa Cup of Nations after Namibia's claims they fielded an ineligible player were thrown out by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Namibia claimed that Burkino Faso should have been removed from the tournament -- which pits the continent's best sides against each other -- because Cameroon-born defender Herve Zengue wasn't eligible. They appealed to African soccer's ruling body, the Confederation of African Football (CAF), whose decision to dismiss the case has now been upheld by CAS. Burkino Faso won both their matches against Namibia during qualifying for the Africa Cup of Nations, with Zengue featuring in both games. He was given a five-year passport from Burkino Faso in March 2011. CAF threw out Namibia's appeal on the basis that their protest letter did not meet certain criteria laid down in their regulations and CAS backed their decision. Burkino Faso can now look ahead to taking their place at the tournament in Group B alongside Ivory Coast, Sudan and Angola. This year's competition will be hosted by Gabon and Equatorial Guinea and starts on January 21.","Burkino Faso have been cleared to play in the Africa Cup of Nations .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- More than a million people went on strike in France Tuesday -- the biggest demonstrations yet in a series of rolling strikes against government plans to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62. The Ministry of the Interior said as many as 1.2 million people walked out of work, while unions put the figure at 3.5 million. There were about 250 demonstrations across the country, the government said. About 89,000 people took to the streets of the capital Paris, police said, while unions said it was 330,000. Either way, the numbers are bigger than the last protest in Paris, which police estimated to be 65,000 marchers. One of the most visible signs of the strike was the presence of students throughout the city in the middle of what should have been their school day. Public school teachers joined the strike and no classes were held Tuesday. A noisy, yelling throng of 300 to 400 students got off a southbound Line 4 Metro train at the Montparnasse station around 12:45 p.m. (6:45 a.m. ET), one of them banging on a drum. One of the young people smiled and waved as they exited the station in unison. To a casual observer, the strike did not seem to affect many aspects of Parisian life. The Metro trains that were not affected ran on time and were not unduly overcrowded. Vehicle traffic inside the city seemed to flow the same as it had the previous day.  Businesses that had been open Monday remained so Tuesday. The strikes are the fourth in the past month in the showdown between workers and the government -- but Tuesday's have no set end date. Rather than end the strike after 24 hours, as the unions have previously done, this time they promised to vote every day on whether to continue. A prolonged strike could lead to chaos with transportation and the delivery of goods. Paris transport workers have already voted to strike again Wednesday, which will affect the Paris Metro, buses and RER trains. Rail workers have also said they will stay off the job Wednesday, and air transport workers are voting Tuesday night on whether to continue industrial action, a transport union spokesman told CNN. The open-ended strike over pension reforms began days after the Senate began voting on the pension reform bill. The lower house has already passed it. Workers in French refineries were also joining the labor action, raising the specter of fuel and gas shortages if the strikes continue. Francois Chereque, head of the trade union French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT), said Tuesday it is the unions' ""last chance to make the government back down."" ""We understand that a reform is needed, but this one is not fair,"" he said. ""This is going to be a big demonstration and the government is playing with fire. The only way we can make the government back down is by taking a tough line."" Chereque said he wanted the walkouts to last, but he noted many employees don't have the means to pay for repeated strikes. The strikes were disrupting travel Tuesday, with only about one in five regional trains operating, officials said. Airports were faring only slightly better, with half of the flights from Paris' Orly and a third of the flights from Charles de Gaulle cancelled Tuesday. About a quarter of education workers were on strike, the Interior Ministry said Tuesday -- very slightly below the percentage who walked off the job September 23. Just over 14 percent of public hospital workers took to the picket lines, slightly higher than last month. Raising the retirement age is a key part of the government's pension reform plans, currently in the hands of the Senate after passing the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. The Senate may vote on the full spate of reforms by the end of the week. President Nicolas Sarkozy has a majority in both houses of Parliament, meaning the measures are expected to pass. Nearly 70 percent of the French public back the unions standing up to the reforms, according to polls published in French newspapers Sunday. CNN's Arthur Brice, Winnie Andrews, Jim Bittermann and Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","NEW: More than a million people went on strike Tuesday, the most cautious estimates say .

"(CNN) -- A team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology won $40,000 in a high-tech scavenger hunt on Saturday by discovering the location of 10 red weather balloons. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced that the MIT team was the first group in the contest to report the latitude and longitude coordinates of all 10 balloons, which were scattered across the United States. DARPA is the U.S. military's research arm. Saturday's challenge is the latest in a series that the agency has hosted since 2004. This contest was designed to test the way social networking and lesser-known Web-based techniques can help accomplish a large-scale, time-critical task. DARPA said in a written statement that the MIT team discovered the locations of the 8-foot-wide balloons less than nine hours after they launched, around 10 a.m. ET. It did not say exactly when the task was completed or how many groups had participated. Johanna Jones, a spokeswoman for DARPA, said the hunt was designed in part to give the military new ideas on ways to operate in a range of situations, from natural disasters to combat. The agency said it plans to meet with teams to discuss their approaches and strategies used to build networks, collect information, and participate in the contest. The challenge was announced on October 29 -- 40 years after the first message was sent on ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet. DARPA said it hopes the contest will lead to advances in the way the military communicates and coordinates activities among multiple geographically separated groups. On MIT's Web site, a link was posted inviting people to sign up to help find the balloons and urging them to invite their friends. It said the MIT Red Balloon Challenge Team ""is interested in studying information flow in social networks, so if we win, we're giving all the money away to the people who help us find the balloons!"" It detailed a chain for giving away the money, beginning with $2,000 given to each person who first sent in the coordinates of each balloon. iReporter on balloon challenge . ""We're giving $2,000 per balloon to the first person to send us the correct coordinates, but that's not all -- we're also giving $1,000 to the person who invited them.

"(CNN) -- Mark Zuckerberg went back to Harvard on Monday on a recruiting trip, his first visit since he dropped out of the prestigious university to found social-media giant Facebook. Clad in his trademark hoodie and T-shirt, Zuckerberg told reporters, ""This is a great time to come."" ""There's a lot of really smart people here, and a lot of them are making decisions on where they are going to work when they graduate in the next couple of weeks,"" he said. The university posted a slickly edited video on YouTube of Zuckerberg's outdoor remarks. Zuckerberg quit Harvard and moved to California to found Facebook in 2004. The university's student newspaper, The Harvard Crimson, says he was back on campus for the first time since he left to recruit students for internships at Facebook. Facebook is ""just getting started,"" Zuckerberg said, according to The Crimson. ""The original goals for the company are to make it so that the whole world can be more open and connected. And you know the last five years have really just been about helping people get signed up and stay connected with their friends,"" he said, The Crimson reported. ""But I think the next five or 10 years are going to be about all of these different products and industries that can be rethought."" Students, not surprisingly, sounded thrilled about the visit. ""If you've seen the movie 'Social Network,' you know that when Zuckerberg attended a talk by Bill Gates it was a pivotal moment,'' Harvard senior Michael Wong told The Boston Globe. ""This could be another iteration of that. The next Mark Zuckerberg could be in the audience.'' Harvard students applied for the Facebook internships within seconds of their being posted online, a university official told the Crimson. Harvard, for its part, was happy to welcome back the billionaire dropout. ""We're very happy to have him here. We've rolled out the red carpet,"" Tania deLuzuriaga, a spokeswoman for the university, said before Zuckerberg's arrival. ""The excitement on campus is palpable. There is a big waiting list of students who want to go to this event and can't get in. It's the talk of campus today."" The meeting serves Facebook's purpose of looking for new engineers. The site, which is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, already has more than 2,000 employees. Zuckerberg ""is eager to connect with computer science and engineering students from some of the best schools in the world, and may well be tomorrow's Facebook innovators,"" Facebook's Andrew Noyes told the Crimson in an e-mail before the visit. Facebook has grown from a dorm-room project to an international sensation, with more than 800 million people using the social-networking site. Zuckerberg's fame has risen in tandem with the site's success. Last year, the Oscar-winning movie ""The Social Network"" profiled the somewhat socially awkward king of social media. At a Facebook product release in September, ""Saturday Night Live's"" Andy Samberg did impressions of Facebook's founder on stage.","Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard University in 2004 .

"(Mental Floss) -- 1942 -- Tweety forced to wear clothes . Lucille Ball's character was pregnant, but was never allowed to say the word ""pregnant."" Tweety Bird first appears in ""A Tale of Two Kitties."" Animator Bob Clampett originally draws him without feathers, but the Hays Office censorship bureau thinks the plucked bird is just a little too naked. So Clampett covers Tweety's titillating flesh with yellow plumage. Clampett doesn't let this pass quietly, though. In the episode, a cat yells to his partner, ""Give me the bird!""

"Reno, Nevada (CNN) -- Exactly a year after a crash that killed 10 spectators and the pilot of a modified World War II era airplane, the Reno Air Races returned to action in the skies over western Nevada. An emotional memorial ceremony was held around noon Sunday (3 p.m. ET) at Reno-Stead Airport, stirring up sad, difficult memories for the thousands in attendance and bringing at least one son of a person killed in last year's crash to tears. Reflecting on the ""devastating blow"" that last year's crash dealt to the Reno ""air race family,"" Reno Air Racing Association President and CEO Mike Houghton talked about the ""tremendous sorrow"" many had experienced and the resilience and courage of those whose relatives were killed. ""In their absence, our lives have changed,"" Houghton said of the 11 victims. ""Yet I have seen firsthand that through their memories and through watching and getting to know those they left behind, we can better understand what it means to love and to live."" U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, then gave brief descriptions of each person killed. A short time later, the victims' names were read out again -- with a white balloon released into the air for each one. The ceremony ended with a parachutist dropping in with the American flag at the end of the national anthem . Soon thereafter, races resumed with aircraft once again crisscrossing the skies. Earlier, Houghton said most people would not have bet that the Reno Air Races would happen this year. That did not hold true, though there have been notable differences: Advance ticket sales were down 7% to 8% from previous years, and the crowds in the first few days since the event opened on Wednesday have been smaller, the association's leader said. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, last year's crash of the modified P-51 airplane -- named ""Galloping Ghost"" and flown by pilot Jimmy Leeward -- was caused by the failure of several lock nuts on the left trim tab, which is part of the airplane's tail. The worn nuts allowed the screws to loosen, ultimately leading the aircraft to plunge into the ground in front of the box seating area, killing Leeward and 10 spectators. More than 60 others were injured. NTSB: High speed, worn parts led to deadly Reno Air Races crash . The Reno Air Race Association made several changes ahead of this year's event to improve safety, as recommended by the federal safety board and the association's own expert panel. For instance, airplanes now must demonstrate their airworthiness at racing speeds before the races. Spectators will be seated farther from the course. The course itself has been ""flattened,"" including the tight turn where last year's accident occurred. Veteran pilot Steve Hinton, who was part of the race association's expert panel, watched last year's accident unfold and commended the changes. The pace plane pilot said he and other pilots believe last year's crash was a fluke and that the plane could have crashed anywhere. ""We're pushing the envelope, and when you're pushing for speed, things happen. But when it affects the public that's a different story."" First-time visitor Perry Paulazzo, a disaster restoration business owner from Santa Fe, New Mexico, agrees. Members of his family have been coming to the Nevada races for years, and he had no hesitation about joining them this year. Even though his cousin saw the accident last year from the grandstands, Paulazzo said, ""I know it was a freak thing."" Paulazzo's biggest disappointment is that part of the course was moved back per the NTSB's recommendation. ""The closer the better,"" he said but he also understands why the race organizers had to make the changes. The five-day Reno Air Races features six classes of race planes, some acrobatic performances and flights by military demonstration teams. The distance and number of pylons the planes have to circle varies by class, but it is the ""unlimited"" contests that draw the most fans. Unlimited race planes are generally modified World War II era fighter planes, some of which can fly at nearly 500 miles per hour. One plane known as Strega -- another modified P-51 like the one Leeward crashed -- ran a qualifying heat of 493 miles per hour. Excitement, speed key to air racing's appeal -- and risk .

"Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from Larry King's autobiography, ""My Remarkable Journey,"" published by Weinstein Books and available at bookstores nationwide.  Larry King anchors ""Larry King Live at 9 p.m. ET on CNN. Larry King recalls a much-needed win at the track during one of the lowest points of his life. I was thirty-seven years old. (In 1971). I had no job. I had a couple hundred thousand dollars in debts. And a four-year-old daughter. I'd take Chaia to our secret park on our visiting days. That's when the pain cut the deepest -- looking at my daughter and knowing I had no way to support her. Things got bleaker and bleaker. I became a recluse. By late May, I was down to forty-two dollars. My rent was paid only until the end of the month. I locked myself in my apartment wondering how bad things could possibly get. Pretty soon I wouldn't even be able to afford cigarettes. I remembered a night when I was a young man in New York, alone, cold, and without cigarettes or the money to buy them -- I had smashed open a vending machine to get a pack. A friend called up and told me to start living like a human being again. He invited me to the track. I had nothing better to do, and I figured it would be good therapy to get out and have lunch with a friend and watch the horses come down the stretch. I'll never forget that day. I put on a Pierre Cardin jeans outfit that had no pockets and drove to Calder Race Course. I can still see the horses warming up before the third race. There was a horse called Lady Forli -- a filly running against males. Normally, female horses don't beat males. We're talking cheap horses. I scanned the board and saw that she was 70-1. But my eyes really opened when I looked at the racing form. Racetrack people talk to each other. So I turned to the guy next to me and said, ""You know, this horse, three races back, won in more or less the same company. Why is she 70-1?"" ""Well,"" the guy said, ""there's a couple of new horses here."" ""Yeah, but she should be, like, 20-1. Not 70--1."" Screw it. I bet ten dollars on the horse to win. But I kept looking at the horse. The more I looked at this horse, the more I liked it. So I bet exactas. I bet Lady Forli on top of every other horse and below every other horse. Now I had what's called a wheel. Larry King's life in pictures » . I kept looking at the horse. Wait a minute, I told myself, I've got four dollars left. I have a pack of cigarettes. I've gotta give the valet two bucks. That still leaves me with money to bet a trifecta. My birthday is November 19. Lady Forli was number 11. So I bet 11 to win, 1 to place, and 9 to show. Now I had bets in for 11 on top, 11 on bottom, and 11 to win. And I had a trifecta -- 11-1-9. When the race began, I had two dollars left to my name -- and that was for the valet. They broke out of the gate. The 1 broke on top, the 9 ran second, and the 11 came out third. The 11 passed the 9, passed the 1, and they ran in a straight line all around the track. There was no question about it. The 11 won by five lengths. The 1 was three lengths ahead of the 9. I had every winning ticket. I had it to win. I had the exacta. I had the trifecta. I collected nearly eight thousand dollars. Eight thousand dollars! It had to be one of the happiest moments of my life -- certainly the most exciting. But I had no pockets. So I stuffed all the money in my jacket. It was bundled up. I didn't know what to do with it. I ran out of the track. The valet attendant came over and said, ""You leaving so early?"" ""Yeah."" ""Bad day, Mr. King?"" I tipped him fifty dollars. The guy nearly fainted. I had to go somewhere, to stop and make sure it was real. I drove to a vacant lot, which is now called Dolphin Stadium. I parked among the weeds and opened up my jacket. All the money spilled out. I counted out about seventy-nine hundred dollars. I paid my child support for the next year. I paid my rent for a year. I bought twenty cartons of cigarettes and stacked them up in my apartment, and I filled the refrigerator. Up to that point, that may have been the happiest moment of my life. Now, today, if I go to the track and win $8,000, it's very nice, but it won't affect my life one iota. It's nice to win. But when you really need it ...","At age 37, Larry King had $42 to his name, no job and a daughter to support .

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN)  -- Attention audiophiles, old-school vinyl listeners and the very rich: Do we have a piece of stereo equipment for you. Angelis Labor's Gabriel turntable is made from bronze and steel and can be customized with up to four arms. It's called the Gabriel Turntable, and you won't find it at Wal-Mart. Crafted in limited editions by an Italian company that will engrave each buyer's name on it, the Gabriel is to a Kenner Close 'N Play what a Ferrari is to a Yugo. ""When I look at it,"" said Placido Pappalardo, co-owner of maker Angelis Labor, ""the only word that comes to mind is love."" Angelis Labor executives proudly unveiled their turntable last week at the International Consumer Electronics Show, where its retro appearance and mechanical design set it apart from the cacophony of digital gadgets on display. That, and the price: up to $64,000, depending on which model is ordered. The Gabriel is made from aluminum, bronze and stainless steel and can be customized with up to four arms. Each arm is made in a Modena, Italy, factory that also builds Ferrari parts. A one-armed model costs about $27,000, while a four-armed version runs for $64,000, including installation.  Watch the Gabriel in action » . ""It is a thing of beauty,"" said Jonathan Valin, executive editor of The Absolute Sound magazine, who saw the turntable in Las Vegas but didn't get to hear it. ""Whether it is a world-class turntable, I don't know."" Why would anyone want four arms on their record player? Different pickup cartridges produce different types of sound, and some audiophiles like to match their record players' arms to different genres of music without going through the hassle of swapping cartridges. The Gabriel is a magnetic suspension turntable, meaning that calibrated magnets are used to lift the platter a few millimeters above its bearings. This helps reduce vibration, which can affect sound quality. ""It's as if the whole turntable is floating in air,"" Pappalardo said. The entire device rests on a custom-built, vibration-dampening table. It takes half a day for an Angelis Labor technician to set the whole thing up and calibrate the turntable. The Gabriel is not yet in stores. Angelis Labor is now seeking a distributor to sell the turntable through specialty audio retailers who can demonstrate it personally for customers. Unlike most manufacturers, the company has no interest in selling it on the Web. ""We will never allow anybody to sell our products on the Internet,"" said Pappalardo, perhaps the only business executive at CES this year to make such a statement. The Gabriel is not the only four-armed record player on the market. Nor is it the most expensive: the German-made, 770-pound Clearaudio Statement turntable costs twice as much. But with vinyl making a comeback, the Gabriel may appeal to audiophiles who believe that listening to old records on a high-end player is like going back in time. ""They're not just eye candy. They actually sound better,"" said Valin, who prefers analog sound to the digital sound produced by CDs and MP3 files. But even Valin wonders what kind of person would pay $64,000 for a turntable. ""You'd have to be very wealthy, very much into vinyl or very crazy,"" he said. ""Or all three.""","An Italian manufacturer unveils a $64,000 turntable at CES in Las Vegas .

"(CNN) -- Doug Kirchoff doesn't think chance explains why a bottle full of messages washed up on the shore of Horn Island, Mississippi. Kirchoff, the supervisor of a crew doing cleanup after the BP oil spill, was astonished by the content of the four letters found inside the bottle last month. ""What we found was it was about a soldier that lost his life in the Afghanistan war and his family had written him a series of letters kind of sharing their thoughts and emotions,"" Kirchoff said Thursday. In them, family members wrote letters to their beloved son and brother, Pvt. James Prosser, 21, a Welsh soldier who was killed in September 2009. ""Each person when we unwound the letters, started opening one letter at a time and reading one letter at a time,"" Kirchoff said. ""As we found out after about two letters the whole occasion turned real somber and we were kind of taken aback and were like, 'Wow! This is a little more than we anticipated at first.'"" In January, Prosser's mother, Sarah Adams, her son, her daughter and the latter's boyfriend dropped the bottle in the Atlantic Ocean at Barbados, 1,300 miles from the Mississippi coast, Adams said. It was a bottle of sambuca, his favorite, she said, and each of them sipped sambuca themselves in Prosser's honor when the bottle was launched. Kirchoff said finding the bottle was like something out of a Hollywood movie. He and the cleanup crew managed to find the family through the internet and contacted them, according to news reports. They also signed a T-shirt and sent it to Adams, Kirchoff said. He sees a parallel between Prosser's death and the oil spill disaster. ""It seems too good to be true. Both of us fighting different tragedies,"" Kirchoff said. ""One in war and us fighting the battle with the oil spill. It just seems like it was just meant to be."" ""It does feel like ... our crew was destined to find this bottle."" Prosser's mother agrees. She told CNN's Kyra Phillips on Friday: ""I think the bottle took the journey it was meant to make. Somehow it was meant to turn up there, and with those guys."" Sarah Adams said she and her family had all but forgotten about the bottle they dropped in the ocean when they were on vacation. She said it was more about honoring Prosser, not about someone finding the bottle. Adams related part of its contents: ""I am and always will be so proud of you, James. Not only because you were a soldier, but more so because of the wonderful, honorable young man you were. ... Your gorgeous smile will stay with me always."" She hopes that someday she will be able to see the place where the bottle washed ashore. In the meantime, she said, she is asking that the workers who found it seal it and keep it.

"Sparendaam, Guyana (CNN) -- Two pilots, an American and a Canadian, were killed Saturday when the small aircraft they were flying crashed into a house in Guyana, officials said. The pilots, whose names were not released, were the only people on board the six-seat plane. Their Piper Aztec twin-engine aircraft had just taken off from Guyana's Ogle Airport when it encountered engine trouble, according to Robeson Benn, the South American country's minister of transport. The plane crashed into a house in the coastal village of Sparendaam, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) east of the capital city of Georgetown, authorities said. Residents in Sparendaam said they heard a loud explosion as the aircraft crashed into a small wooden house. The only person in the house, Florence Dyer-Tyndall, 69, told reporters she ran out of the house after hearing the impact and seconds before it burst into flames. The plane was registered to an American aerial photography and survey company based in Miami, the Guyana Civil Aviation Authority said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Los Angeles Police Department was ""factually and legally"" proper in 2009 when it fired Christopher Dorner, who killed four people and wounded three others in a rampage this year, an internal department report said Friday. Dorner, 33, apparently took his own life during a police shootout in February after he was cornered in a mountain cabin in San Bernardino County, California, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles. After a five-month review of Dorner's firing, a team headed by a special assistant to the police chief found that the officer's termination ""was not only appropriate, it was the only course the department could have taken based on the facts and evidence,"" the internal report said. The review team found the firing ""sound and just,"" the report said. Dorner was removed from the police department in September 2008 and officially terminated in January 2009 for filing a false complaint against his training officer, who Dorner alleged kicked a suspect. In an 11-page manifesto this year, Dorner said he was relieved of his duties after he reported excessive force by a fellow officer in 2007. ""After a thorough review of all the available information, my analysis concludes that the discharge of Christopher Dorner was justified,"" Gerald Chaleff, LAPD special assistant for constitutional policing, said in a statement. ""His discharge was based on his own actions. The allegations he made against his training officer appeared to have been made in an effort to forward his own agenda."" Police Chief Charlie Beck said he sought Chaleff's review ""because I wanted to ensure that the Los Angeles Police Department is fair and transparent in all that we do. ""All of us recognize that as a department we are not perfect,"" Beck said in a statement. ""Nonetheless, this report shows that the discharge of Christopher Dorner was factually and legally the right decision."" The report was submitted to the Board of Police Commissioners, which will hear the matter at its meeting Tuesday. A second department report will be published later this year on issues raised by Dorner and others about alleged corruption in the department's disciplinary process and about the state of employee relations. After unsuccessfully challenging his dismissal in court, police say, the renegade officer launched a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the LAPD, targeting numerous officers involved in his case and their families. He had served in the Navy. Dorner killed the daughter of his police union representative, her fiancÃ©, a police officer in suburban Riverside and a sheriff's deputy.","An internal Los Angeles Police team reviews the 2009 termination of officer Christopher Dorner .

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- A New Jersey man whose son is at the center of a five-year international custody fight that has attracted attention from high-level U.S. and Brazilian authorities expressed hope Wednesday that he will get his boy back. David Goldman has been fighting for custody of his son, Sean, since the boy's mother took him to Brazil in 2004. ""I always keep hope, but I don't really expect it, given the things that always happen,"" David Goldman told CNN on what he said was his 10th or 11th trip to Brazil to regain custody of 9-year-old Sean Richard Goldman. ""Until the wheels are up, I don't expect it and it's tragic."" David Goldman's comments came after a Brazilian Supreme Court judge on Tuesday suspended a lower court's order that would have granted Sean's custody to the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, where father and son were to reunite Wednesday. Judge Marco Aurelio wrote in his decision that taking Sean ""in an abrupt manner"" from his home could cause the boy psychological harm. But Goldman said the boy was suffering psychological harm simply by remaining with his Brazilian relatives, whom Goldman accused of turning his son against him. ""According to the expert reports, they've already been doing that for some time and that's very, very sad,"" said Goldman, who captains boats and works part-time as a model. ""The worst is -- he's my son, I'm his dad, and I can't help him. The legal system here right now is preventing me from helping my child.""  Watch father explain Brazilian court battle » . The incident began in June 2004, when Goldman's wife, Bruna Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro, took Sean from the family's New Jersey home for what was to have been a two-week vacation in her native Brazil. But instead of returning, she divorced Goldman, married Joao Paulo Lins e Silva, a Brazilian lawyer, and remained in Brazil. She died there last September giving birth to a daughter. Sean attends a private school and lives in a sprawling home in Rio with his half-sister and his stepfather. Recently, after nearly five years without seeing his child, Goldman began visiting him. ""He asked me where have I been for this amount of time. How come I never came to visit him?"" Goldman said. On CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Wednesday, Goldman said that public prosecutors and psychiatrists have declared the boy ""emotionally damaged,"" and added, ""He needs to be reunited with me immediately."" In March, a spokesman for the boy's Brazilian relatives said he did not dispute the father's biological rights, but said other matters needed to be weighed. ""The fact of the matter is that, in order to be a parent, you have to be more than a DNA donor,"" said Helvecio Ribeiro. ""Fatherhood is not about making home movies and taking pictures. It's about sacrifice; it's about providing support for your child; it's about being there even when you are not there."" Watch Goldman describe his fight to get his son back » . He said Goldman had failed to do that, and accused him of having ""paid not a dime of child support"" and made allegations ""all over the place about us not allowing him to visit the child that are completely untrue."" Goldman responded, ""Can you take someone's child to another country and then expect the parent to support you in the abduction of the child?"" He said he had been making tireless efforts since his son was ""abducted"" to have him repatriated, ""never, ever stopping."" Goldman said the case sends the wrong message to the world about Brazil's legal system. ""They're sending this message that anyone can take any child from anywhere, come to Brazil and if they can hide enough or stall enough or keep the child here long enough then they're entitled to that child? That's unacceptable."" Tuesday night's decision, which means the entire Brazilian Supreme Court will hear the case, comes a day after a Superior Court justice ordered Sean to be taken to the U.S. Consulate in Rio and handed over to his father, who had arrived early Tuesday from New Jersey to pick him up. The exchange was to have taken place on Wednesday. The case has attracted attention from politicians. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with Brazil's foreign minister Wednesday. A senior State Department official said the case was the first thing they talked about. ""We are disappointed by the decision,"" State Department spokesman Philip Crowley told reporters Wednesday. ""But U.S. Embassy officials continue to work with the family, and will meet with Brazilian attorneys and Mr. Goldman's attorney to learn next steps in the legal process."" A lawyer representing the boy's Brazilian relatives said earlier this week, when it appeared that he would be returned to the United States, that doing so would harm him. ""The child said many times that he wanted to stay in Brazil,"" said lawyer Sergio Tostes. ""This is not human and it is a cruelty."" Meanwhile, Goldman was not giving up. ""My focus is to do everything I can, through every legal means in all matters of law, to reunite with my son and bring him home,"" he said. According to the U.S. State Department, 66 American-born children have been taken by a parent to Brazil, in violation of international treaties.

"(CNN) -- Police in Germany are investigating after sandwiches left on the doorstep of a company labeled as a ""present"" turned out to be spiked with rat or mouse poison. About 25 workers at the company in the town of Steinfeld, Lower Saxony, helped themselves to the filled bread rolls Tuesday after they were left in two boxes that said they were to be eaten, police in nearby Cloppenburg said. Later that afternoon, an alarm was raised when a strange substance was noticed atop the bread rolls, the police statement said. The discovery prompted 11 people to admit themselves to local hospitals, but no one has shown any symptoms of illness as a result of eating the bread rolls, police said. The substance was flown to a Berlin hospital for tests that confirmed it was rat or mouse poison. The strength of the poison is not yet known, police said. Police said Thursday that they have spoken to all 25 people affected, but no new leads have been confirmed. Officers believe that an unknown person dropped off the boxes of sandwiches, complete with paper plates and napkins, before 6:30 a.m. Tuesday. Witnesses said the bread seemed fresh, so the police are eager to find out who might have bought a large number of rolls in the area on Monday evening or Tuesday morning. They are also looking into recent purchases of wheat-based rodent poison in the area. The company involved, Mueller-Technik, declined to comment on the incident Thursday. It makes car parts and employs 210 people, according to its website. Steinfeld is a town of about 9,500 inhabitants.","NEW: Police are looking for people who bought lots of bread rolls or mouse poison locally .

"(CNN) -- One person was injured and around 70 trailers were damaged in Springfield, Illinois, on Monday when a microburst with straight line winds of between 70 and 80 mph whipped through the area. The injured person suffered a minor laceration, said David Butt, director of the Sangamon County Office of Emergency Management. No trailers overturned. ""The damage occurred from debris. Tree limbs at a height of 10 to 20 feet were broken and they damaged the roofs of the mobile homes,"" Butt said. ""No roofs were torn off. No roofs were peeled back. The only damage to roofs was being penetrated by wind-blown debris."" Also on Monday, a tornado watch was in effect for parts of north central Kansas and south central Nebraska. Hail up to 4 inches in diameter and wind gusts as high as 80 mph could accompany those storms. Looking into Tuesday, there is a slight risk of severe thunderstorms across much of the country's midsection. The primary threat will be very large hail, mostly in Nebraska, Kansas, western Oklahoma and the eastern Texas panhandle. A few isolated tornadoes cannot be ruled out. Cities and towns that will have the highest risk for severe storms Tuesday include Des Moines, Iowa; Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska; Garden City and Liberal, Kansas; and Woodward, Oklahoma and Amarillo in the Texas panhandle.","The person suffered a minor laceration .

"(CNN)  -- More than 1,000 police officers were deployed to the southern Israeli Bedouin town of Rahat on Sunday morning as two dozen Jewish right-wing extremists protested what they said was unlawful Arab construction on neighboring hilltops. A Bedouin Arab girl protests near an Israeli police roadblock on the outskirts of Rahat in Israel on Sunday. Several hundred Bedouin residents who are Israeli citizens held a counter-demonstration in the center of town. About 25 protesters arrived in two buses under police presence. They were allowed to march a short distance, as police on horseback and in a helicopter hovered around. Police closed off the main road to prevent the two sides from coming into contact. ""They are taking over the land of Israel without permission, building on hilltops as you can see here to the right and to the left,"" said Baruch Marzel, who is associated with the banned Kach movement. Far-right parliament member Michael Ben Ari of the National Union party said allowing Bedouins to settle on hilltops while removing Jews from hilltops in the West Bank is discrimination. In the town center, residents held a demonstration with lawmakers from Israeli Arab parties in attendance. Talab El-Sana, a Bedouin from the Democratic Arab Party, urged the counter-demonstrators to show restraint. ""We told the people to be quiet, we are not against the policemen, we are against these people who call for discrimination or transfer for the Arabs,"" he told CNN. The march ended without any major incident.","Jewish right-wing extremists protest Arab construction in neighboring area .

"(CNN) -- The world's oceans are full of trash, causing ""tremendous"" negative impacts on coastal life and ecology, according to a U.N. report released Monday. The oceans will continue to fill up with junk discarded from cities and boats without urgent action to address this buildup of marine debris, the United Nations Environment Programme says in a report titled ""Marine Litter: A Global Challenge."" Current efforts to address the problem are not working, and the issue is ""far from being solved,"" the report says. ""There is an increasingly urgent need to approach the issue of marine litter through better enforcement of laws and regulations, expanded outreach and educational campaigns, and the employment of strong economic instruments and incentives,"" the report says. ""Although a number of countries have taken steps at the national level to deal with marine litter, the overall situation is not improving."" Scientists have been watching trash pile up in the world's oceans for about a half-century, when plastics came into widespread use. Since plastics don't biodegrade, or do so very slowly, the trash tends to remain in the ocean, where circling currents collect the material in several marine ""garbage patches.""  See a map of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch » . One of these trashy areas is said to be roughly the size of Texas. The water in these at-sea landfills is thick like a plastic soup, oceanographers told CNN. The trash patches are located in ""very remote parts of the ocean where hardly anyone goes, except the occasional research vessel,"" said Peter Niiler, a distinguished researcher and oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Plastics and cigarette butts are the most common types of ocean litter, with plastic making up about 80 percent of the ocean trash collected in some areas of the world, a U.N. news release says. The ocean litter is a problem for coastal communities, which rely on clean beaches for tourism dollars and to boost quality of life for their residents, the report says. Ocean trash also affects marine life and degrades human health. Sea turtles, for example, think plastic grocery bags are jellyfish when the bags are floating in the ocean. An untold number of the turtles and other creatures, such as Hawaii's endangered monk seal, swallow the bags and suffocate, drown or starve, said Holly Bamford, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's marine debris program. Birds face similar issues when they eat pieces of plastic out of the water. In the North Sea, a survey found 94 percent of fulmars, a type of seabird, had plastics in their stomachs, the U.N. report says. The birds, on average, had about 34 pieces of plastic in their stomachs. A surprising amount of trash that ends up in the ocean starts on the land, the report says. In Australia, for instance, a survey found 80 percent of ocean trash starts on the land. One of the key questions for people interested in ocean trash is how much of it is out there, but Monday's U.N. report does not solve that mystery. The U.N. says little is known about the extent of litter in the oceans, and more data is needed for the problem to be adequately addressed. ""This deficiency, in combination with the lack of specific legislation, adequate law enforcement and funding, are the primary reasons why the problem of marine litter is far from being solved,"" the report says. ""Unless effective action is taken, the global marine litter problem will only continue to worsen in the years to come."" The report does suggest several solutions, among them: . Volunteer efforts try to address the issue now, and the Ocean Conservancy says it organizes the largest of these. Last year, 400,000 volunteers from more than 100 countries picked up 6.8 million pounds of trash from beaches, preventing it from harming the ocean, said Tom McCann, a spokesman for the group. ""It's entirely preventable,"" he said of the problem. ""It's something we can solve ourselves."" McCann said people can prevent trash from ending up in the ocean by making smarter choices about the products they buy. Some of the Ocean Conservancy's recommendations include: .","New U.N. report says ocean trash is a ""tremendous"" problem .
Much of the trash is plastic, which goes away very slowly, if ever .
Scientists say plastic collects in large ""garbage patches"" in oceans .
One such garbage patch is said to be the size of Texas ."
"(CNN) -- Indian authorities scrambled to rescue thousands of people trapped after floods and landslides ravaged the Himalayan region, leaving up to 1,000 feared dead. The exact number of those killed will not be clear until the muddy waters are cleaned up and the bodies recovered, said Vijay Bahuguna, the chief minister of Uttarakhand state, which is the worst-hit. ""Certainly, the number of the dead is much higher than 550 ... and it could be around 1,000 as figures coming in suggest,"" he said Saturday. Emergency operations include the military and all forms of transportation, including trains moving people for free. About 70,000 have been evacuated since the floods hit this month. Barrages of water, mud and rocks have hit scores of towns and villages in the Indian state, inundating homes, shrines, roads and vehicles. Bahuguna, has described the disaster as a ""Himalayan tsunami."" Dotted with temples and often referred to as ""the Land of Gods,"" Uttarakhand attracts large numbers of pilgrims from around India to its mountainous reaches. Those travelers, many of them far from home and short on belongings, are now caught up in the destruction. Thousands of rescue workers are trying to reach more than 50,000 people cut off by the waters. Bahuguna told CNN's sister network CNN-IBN on Friday night that the death toll was 556 but could rise. The bodies ""were either buried or floating in slush,"" he said. It will take 15 days to complete evacuations in the province, he added. Other parts of northern India, including New Delhi, have also been hit by flooding, but Uttarakhand has suffered the worst of the devastation. The rains over the region have eased in the past few days, aiding in the rescue of about 30,000 people, Bahuguna said. Gurjit Singh, who had traveled to the town of Gobindghat with his 12-year-old son, described a chaotic scene as people tried to escape the flooding last week. ""There was nothing but death in front of us,"" Singh said Thursday after getting out of a crowded car ferrying people to dry, flat land. ""Now that we've got out, we feel like we've got a second life."" His son, Rana Udesh Pratap, said the trek to safety was long. ""I held my father's hand and walked and walked and walked on a narrow path,"" he said. The two had made a pilgrimage to Uttarakhand from the nearby state of Punjab to visit the Sikh Hemkunt Sahib shrine.","The exact number of those killed will not be clear until the mess is cleaned up .

"(CNN) -- The last time Svetlana Kuznetsova beat Serena Williams, the Russian went on to win the French Open. When they meet again this week, that 2009 quarterfinal clash will be on both their minds. ""It will be a good match -- I mean, the last time we played here, she won,"" Williams said after reaching the last eight at Roland Garros with Sunday's comprehensive 6-1 6-3 victory over Italian clay specialist Roberta Vinci. ""That will probably get her pumped up, and she's on a comeback, and she has nothing to lose and everything to gain. She's also won this tournament before. ""So it's not going to be an easy match for me, for sure. But I don't want to stop at the quarters."" Williams lost in the first round in Paris last year, but has dominated the women's game since then -- winning Wimbledon, the Olympic singles and doubles, the U.S. Open and the WTA Championships. Interactive: The secrets of French Open champions . The American surprisingly lost in the Australian Open quarterfinals in January, but is now on a 28-match winning streak as she seeks to follow up her only French success back in 2002. That run has only been surpassed this decade by her older sister Venus (35 wins) and Justine Henin (32). ""I honestly don't even consider it a streak,"" Williams said. ""Every day, everybody's like, 'You're on this streak.' But for me it's about winning the matches. ""It's like I don't care to be on a streak; I don't care not to be on a streak. I just want to win this match. If that means it's going to be consecutive and it's going to be winning streaks, that's great. ""But at the end of the day, I just want to hold up the winner's trophy and whatever it takes to get there."" Williams has won 15 grand slam titles, and Kuznetsova is seeking her third as she rebuilds her career after injury problems that meant she has had to play qualifying events to get into the main draw of some of the bigger tournaments this year. ""I am excited to come back, it's been six months off,"" the 27-year-old told CNN's Open Court before the French Open. ""It was my biggest break for my whole career and I was a little bit tired -- nonstop for 12 years all the time from January to November every year."" Kuznetsova, like Williams, reached the quarterfinals in Melbourne and has matched that in Paris after beating German eighth seed Angelique Kerber 6-4 4-6 6-3 on Sunday. She has won only two of eight encounters with Williams, the other being in Stuttgart in 2007 -- a year in which she reached the final of the U.S. Open but could not match her 2004 success in New York. ""I'll just go out there and play my game,"" the world No. 39 told reporters. ""Sometimes I can be very good. Sometimes I just have bad days. ""I'm just a human being, maybe even more than other people. But I'm just trying to do my job. ""I don't care if I'm an underdog or not, I just go out there and try to play my game."" Last year's runner-up Sara Errani also reached the quarterfinals, with the Italian fifth seed battling to a 5-7 6-4 6-3 win over Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro. Errani, who makes up the top-ranked doubles team with compatriot Vinci, needed two and a half hours on court before beating the world No. 20 -- who was hoping to match her last-eight appearance in Paris in 2008.

"Mariposa, California (CNN) -- A campfire left untended sparked a blaze near Yosemite National Park that is threatening hundreds of homeowners, but firefighters are starting to get a handle on it. About 500 homes are under mandatory evacuation orders, including one that belongs to Mariposa County Supervisor Kevin Cann. ""My cats are with some friends and the dogs are with some other friends,"" Cann told CNN affiliate KGPE. ""When you are evacuated, it makes you think,"" he said. ""I've been in that house 23 years and it makes you think about what's really important; what do you have to take, and, in the end, it's not all that much."" The quickly spreading flames forced many, like Orlando Vigil, to flee in a hurry. He made it out safely, but had to drop the animals from his property at the Mariposa County Fairgrounds. They're safe now, but he's not so sure about his home. ""We'll see if there's anything when we get back,"" Vigil said. Beating back the fire . More than 2,000 firefighters are battling the blaze in the steep, rugged terrain west of Yosemite. Summer wildfires are nothing new in California. But this one is happening weeks earlier than normal, and comes as parts of the state experience ""exceptional"" dryness that could fuel flames. ""We usually see this sort of fire behavior in August. This is June,"" said Gary Wuchner, fire spokesman for Yosemite National Park. ""It's making us nervous."" The Carstens Fire was first spotted Sunday afternoon, after embers from a campfire that hadn't been totally put out spread into the surrounding forest. By Tuesday night, it had burned nearly 1,900 acres, of which 40% was considered contained, according to CalFire. Some 2,200 fire personnel were working the scene, using 53 engines, 11 water tenders, seven bulldozers and other equipment. Some 800 structures are being threatened. Are you there? Share photos, video but stay safe . Tending to the evacuees . The evacuations forced some residents into the Red Cross shelter at Mariposa Elementary School. Officials are there with food, medical help and other basics. ""We also have a mental health worker to help those that are overstressed emotionally from the ordeal of being uprooted from their home,"" Cindy Thomas of the Red Cross told KGPE. Not everyone is heeding the calls to evacuate, however. Among them is Paul ""Bear"" Vasquez. More than 37 million people have viewed his YouTube video showing him becoming overjoyed and then breaking down at the site of a vibrant double rainbow over a mountain in 2010. Today, that mountain is singed by the Carstens Fire. But Vasquez says he's staying on the property he bought in 1998, hacking out of the wilderness a spot for the home where he's raised his children.

"(CNN) -- Should unauthorized disclosures of classified information be praised or condemned? The events of recent weeks -- and the disclosures of Edward Snowden in particular -- have propelled this question to the forefront of public debate. Unfortunately, the responses have been polarized, with some hailing leakers as patriots, and others condemning them as traitors. Some have cited the Founding Fathers to make the case that Snowden was justified in revealing secrets. As is often the case, the truth is more complicated. The first thing to bear in mind is that employees such as Snowden volunteer to be entrusted with classified information. When they disclose secrets, they are violating the trust that they have asked to be placed in themselves. And they are public employees (even if they happen to be contractors rather than permanent employees). The Snowden Index: A glance at opinions about the NSA leaker . This means that when they disclose secrets, they are disobeying not only their supervisors, but also the public, whose representatives have enacted laws and regulations relating to the handling of classified information. Finally, it is not personal secrets that these employees are revealing but state secrets. As such, their actions endanger their fellow citizens when they undermine security operations. In sum, when a government employee makes an unauthorized disclosure he is violating trust, disobeying the law and potentially endangering others. These are points worth absorbing before cheering on leakers and whistle-blowers as ""patriots."" This does not mean that an employee can never be justified in making an unauthorized disclosure. An employee could uncover activity so heinous that he feels confident that citizens and overseers would want to know about it so that they could punish the wrongdoers. This could be activity that is obviously criminal or clearly immoral. An example would be the inhumane practices employed at Abu Ghraib prison, whose disclosure led to the prosecution of wrongdoers rather than the complainant. The recent disclosures do not meet this standard though -- Snowden does not claim to have exposed criminal activity. Well, has he uncovered activity that is clearly seen as immoral by his fellow citizens? This is questionable since polls suggest that at least half the country favors secret electronic surveillance and disapproves of his actions. Is it enough that Snowden thinks that the National Security Agency's program is morally wrong? This argument is obviously problematic. For if Snowden is allowed to break the law whenever he likes, then why shouldn't others? Should we allow a fiscal conservative in the military to reveal a nuclear weapons programs he deems too expensive? Should a Secret Service officer who supports Greenpeace be allowed to disclose the use of a decoy Air Force One because the increased carbon emissions hurt his conscience? What these hypotheticals make clear is that when officials break the law they must be able to give reasons why we the public would want the secret exposed, not why they would want the secret exposed. Perhaps it will be argued that Snowden thought the program violated the Fourth Amendment. It is worth asking: What happens when an employee becomes aware of a secret policy or operation whose lawfulness might be unclear to him, perhaps because the law is vague or because he worries that overseers are unaware of the activity in question? Under these circumstances, the employee would be justified in bringing his concern to the attention of higher-ups. Should he fear retaliation, he might even be justified in approaching law enforcement or even lawmakers. But once he knows that lawmakers and federal judges have also consented to the secret activity in question (as in the PRISM case), then the employee's options are considerably narrower. If the policy or operation violates his conscience, then he ought to resign. But if he now decides to disclose the secret policy or operation, then he must accept the legal consequences. Why? Because by subverting the decisions of the president, Congress, and the courts, the employee has undermined the authority that the people have vested in these representative institutions. Therefore to refuse now to submit to the law, to flee overseas, as Snowden has done, is to show contempt for democracy and the rule of law. If an employee believes that he has broken the law for reasons that his fellow citizens will understand, then he ought to be willing to take his chances before a jury (as in the Bradley Manning case). The moral limits outlined above will be rejected by those who praise unauthorized disclosures. They will insist that unauthorized disclosures advance democracy and American values because transparency is democratic and secrecy is un-American. But this argument cannot be taken seriously. After all, there are things that the public itself may not want to know, which is why our elected representatives have enacted laws and regulations prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of classified information. Or are our public officials only allowed to keep secrets when unelected and unaccountable government contractors agree that they may? If that is what we believe, then why have a president? Or hold elections? Indeed, why have a Constitution? Just let the contractors run the show. Opinion: Edward Snowden is a hero . It is also worth recalling that the Constitution was not written solely to promote transparency. There are other important values that must also be taken into account, such as the need for what the Framers called ""energy"" in government, i.e., the capacity to act speedily and secretly in the national interest. This point is often forgotten by those advocating on behalf of employees who make unauthorized disclosures. ""Has Thomas Jefferson's notion that the bedrock of democracy rests on an informed citizenry become as 'quaint' as the Geneva Conventions?"" Coleen Rowley recently asked on CNN. Rowley might be surprised to learn that in May 1784, Congress overwhelmingly approved a resolution declaring all diplomatic correspondence be ""considered, at all times, as under an injunction of secrecy, except as to such parts of them as Congress shall, by special permission, allow to be published or communicated."" The mover of the resolution was ... you guessed it, Thomas Jefferson. And what about Meriwether Lewis and William Clark's expedition, which was, as Stephen Knott notes in ""Secret and Sanctioned,"" only one of the many covert operations undertaken by Jefferson and his successors? Proponents of transparency also love to cite James Madison, the Father of the Constitution, who once said that ""a popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy."" What they don't realize is that these words come from a letter that Madison wrote to Lt. Gov. William Barry commending Kentucky's appropriations for public education in mathematics. To see what Madison really thought about secrecy it is worth recalling the case of David Howell, Rhode Island's delegate to the Continental Congress, who leaked to the Providence Gazette news of a friendly overture from Sweden. Howell leaked the news, which had been recorded in the Secret Journal on Benjamin Franklin's request, because he believed it vindicated his stance that the United States would be able to mend its war-ravaged finances by raising new loans in Europe, and that Congress therefore did not have to impose a 5% import duty that Rhode Islanders opposed. Claiming to have informed his constituents of ""such things as they have a right to know,"" Howell subsequently defended his action before the Continental Congress as an exercise of ""the freedom of speech."" Sound familiar? Guess how his colleagues -- our revered Founders -- reacted. Howell's response, Madison observes in his ""Notes of Debates,"" provoked ""universal indignation,"" because his colleagues viewed his actions as having betrayed the Swedes and presented the public with a distorted picture of the United States' financial dealings that could not be corrected without revealing ""many delicate transactions."" Not surprisingly, then, Howell's defense of his action was formally condemned -- on Alexander Hamilton's motion -- as ""highly derogatory to the honor and dignity of the United States in Congress."" To be clear, the fact that secrecy has long been seen as being in the public interest does not give officials carte blanche to do as they like. Secrecy needs to be balanced against important civil liberties. The central question is: Who should do the balancing? The reason the Constitution entrusts the business of balancing values to the three branches is because the officials in charge are chosen by the people and are in a position to check each other, especially with respect to secret policies or operations that it would be self-defeating to make public. So when an individual decides to short-circuit or circumvent this careful arrangement, he must only do so when there is reason to believe that representatives from all three branches have allowed grave wrongdoing to go unchecked. Otherwise, an unauthorized disclosure is nothing more than an effort to impose one's own narrow political view on one's fellow citizens. In such a case, it is the leaker, not state secrecy, that poses an ""existential threat"" to American democracy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rahul Sagar.","Rahul Sagar: Edward Snowden took on a heavy burden when he leaked U.S. secrets .

"(REAL SIMPLE) -- One morning, nearly 20 years ago, I was lying in bed. It was late. I was supposed to be working, but I seemed glued to the mattress. I hated myself for my laziness. To enjoy being idle, you can pretend to meditate, stare at the clouds or lie in a field. And then, by chance, I picked up a collection of writings by Dr. Samuel Johnson, the 18th-century wit and the compiler of the first comprehensive English dictionary. In the book were excerpts from a weekly column he had written called ""The Idler,"" in which the great man celebrated idleness as an aspiration, writing in 1758, ""Every man is, or hopes to be, an Idler."" This was an epiphany for me. Idleness, it seemed, was not bad. It was noble. It was excessive busyness that caused all the problems! So I got out of bed and started a magazine called 'The Idler,"" in order to remind people of the forgotten, simple pleasures of doing nothing. I even wrote books about it. And, yes, you could say that idleness became my life's work. So, based on all those years of tough-going research, here are my top tips for people who find it difficult to just be. 1. Banish the guilt. We are all told that we should be terribly busy, so we can't laze around without that nagging feeling that we need to be getting stuff done. I rejected my guilt upon learning that Europeans in the Middle Ages felt no shame for lolling about. Their favorite philosopher, Aristotle, had praised the contemplative life, and the monks spent a lot of time just praying and chanting. Guilt for doing nothing is artificially imposed on us by a Calvinistic and Puritanical culture that wants us to work hard. When you understand that it hasn't always been this way, it becomes easier to shake it off. Real Simple: How to worry less . 2. Choose the right role models. Most of the great musicians and poets were idlers. So feed yourself a diet of John Lennon, Oscar Wilde, Walt Whitman, and the like. Carrying a slim volume of verse in your purse or pocket can be therapeutic -- something from Keats, who wrote of ""evenings steep'd in honied indolence,"" or Wordsworth, of course. (What could be more idle than wandering lonely as a cloud?) It's delightful to read a few lines while you're on a bus or a train, then stare out the window and ponder their meaning. 3. Sketch a flower. If you are new to idling and feel compelled to be purposefully occupied, sketching a flower at the kitchen table can be an excellent way to bring some divine contemplation into your life. The act of drawing makes you observe the bloom in a way you never have before. All anxieties fly away as you lose yourself in close study. And at the end of it you have a pretty little sketch. Real Simple: 34 low-cost, make-you-smile ideas . 4. Go bumbling. Bumbling is a nice word that means ""wandering around without purpose."" It was indulged in by the poets of 19th-century Paris. They called themselves flâneurs and were said to have taken tortoises around on leads, which gives you an idea of the tempo of their rambles. Children are good bumblers. Try making a deliberate effort to slow down your walking pace. You'll find yourself coming alive, and you'll enjoy simply soaking in the day. 5. Play the ukulele. The ukulele is the sound of not working. My wife hates it for that very reason: The twang of those strings means that I am not doing something useful around the house. I keep my ukulele in the kitchen and play it at odd moments, like while I'm waiting for the kettle to boil. 6. Bring back Sundays. Many religions still observe a Sabbath, whether it's Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. And for a long time secular society embraced Sundays as a day of rest, too. But now Sundays are as busy and stress-filled as any other day. Having a day of rest was a very practical idea: We were excused from all labor and devoted ourselves to pleasure and family. Take that ancient wisdom to heart and declare at least one day of the week as a do-nothing day. Don't clean the house or do the laundry; don't get in the car. Stay home and eat chocolate and drink wine. Be kind to yourself. 7. Lie in a field. Doing nothing is profoundly healing -- to yourself and to the planet. It is precisely our restless activity that has caused the environmental crisis. So do some good by taking a break from ""doing"" and go and lie on your back in a field. Listen to the birds and smell the grass. Real Simple: 10 guilt-free strategies for saying no . 8. Gaze at the clouds. Don't have a field nearby? Doing nothing can easily be dignified by calling it ""cloud spotting."" It gives a purpose to your dawdling. Go outside and look up at the ever-changing skies and spot the cirrus and the cumulonimbus. 9. Take a nap. To indulge in a siesta after lunch is the most wonderful luxury: It softens tempers and guards against grumpiness. Yet our culture has decided that naps are for wimps. A nap is acceptable only if it is called a ""power nap"" -- a short doze that is supposed to return you to the office with more energy to kick some ass. But you should nap, not for the profit of a corporation but for your own health. Research has shown that a daily snooze can reduce the risk of heart attack. And just knowing you're going to sleep after lunch seems to make the morning less stressful. If curling up in your office isn't an option, go somewhere quiet, like a church or a park bench, and close your eyes for even just five minutes. 10. Pretend to meditate. For us westerners, meditation is an accepted way of doing nothing. Tell everyone you're going to meditate, then go into your bedroom, shut the door, and stare out the window or read or lie down for half an hour. You have excused yourself from household tasks and can indulge in contemplation, reflection, and that underrated pleasure, thinking, without fear of disapproval.

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- A suicide bomber drove a car packed with explosives into a convoy carrying a Qatari delegation in Mogadishu Sunday, killing at least eight people and wounding seven, authorities and witnesses said. Farah Hassan, who witnessed the aftermath of the attack, said those killed were all bystanders at the busy intersection in Somalia's capital. Earlier reports about the attack said Somalia's interior minister was traveling in the convoy, but the minister's office said he was not there. Somali prime minister spokesman Ahmed Adan and District Commissioner Abdi Warsame said no one in the convoy was hurt in the attack. The radical Islamist group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the bombing, and said six soldiers were killed and nine wounded. ""The mujahideen have today carried out a martyrdom operation in Mogadishu, targeting Somali interior minister convoy,"" the militant group posted on a pro-Al-Shabaab website. Several principal roads in and around the capital were locked down by government troops in recent days amid threats by Al-Shabaab to launch deadly attacks. The site of Sunday's suicide bombing was just reopened a day ago. Emergency vehicles, sirens wailing, rushed to the gruesome scene, where incinerated bodies and body parts were strewn across the road. The wounded, some of them seriously injured, were rushed to the hospital. A bulldozer sifted through the rubble, which covered most of the street. ""What have they done to us?"" one woman wailed. The latest attack comes two days ahead of a conference on Somalia in London, where Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud is expected to present his plans to rebuild the military and the country as a whole, as well as solicit international support. Al-Shabaab has waged several recent attacks in Somalia. Last month, at least 10 heavily armed militants forced their way into a court building in Mogadishu, killing 29 people, sources said. In that attack, some assailants detonated explosives while others exchanged fire with government security officers, witnesses said. At least nine members of Al-Shabaab were also killed, the sources said. Somalia's president has called the uptick in strikes ""nothing but a sign of desperation by the terrorists,"" saying the militants ""are in complete decline."" Somalia's government, backed by African Union peacekeepers, has been battling Islamist guerrillas for years.

"(CNN) -- A call for Smurfs brought together 1,253 dressed-up-in-blue people in County Monaghan, Ireland. A 4,703-pound cheesecake rolled out in Mexico City. A 7-year-old Michigan boy made a ball of plastic wrap that's 11 feet across. Anthony Victor of India has hair measuring 7.12 inches sprouting from the center of his outer ears. Meanwhile, in Ellensburg, Washington, 13-year-old Brenden Adams is having a hard time fitting into cars. At 7 feet 4.6 inches, Adams -- who as a kindergartner was taller than his teacher -- has made it into the Guinness World Records 2010 book, released Thursday, as the tallest teenage boy. It's a stature he said was earned simply because his 12th chromosome split in half. And while the height has its perks -- ""You don't get picked on as much""  -- he wishes strangers wouldn't stare. ""I'm another person, just like everybody else,"" said Adams, who doesn't play basketball -- two knee replacements insured that -- and prefers to hang out with friends, camp and ride dirt bikes. The tallest teenage boy is one of about 4,000 records listed in this year's book -- a number that accounts for a mere 10 percent of all the mind-blowing stats that make up the Guinness World Records database, said Stuart Claxton, a spokesman for the organization that began publishing feats in 1955.

So why would someone set out to spend the most time in a bumper car (record: 24 hours), or solve the most Rubik's Cubes in one hour (record: 185)? ""It's an innate part of our psyche as human beings to explore how far we can push the boundaries,"" said Claxton, who's been with Guinness World Records since 2000.

""I told him, 'We'll get a bunch of books, and we'll see if there's anything we can do,' "" she said. Building a ball of plastic wrap was where they landed. And what started with a softball-sized ball grew and grew and grew into a 281-pound monstrosity, earning Lonsway, now 9, a spot in this year's record book. ""It does take up a nice corner of the garage,"" Grames said with a laugh. And when people comment on how ""cool"" it is, she said her husband's response is always the same: ""You want it?

And while the most tattooed man -- 99 percent of his body is covered -- ""may not be my cup of tea,"" he said that when it comes to categories there's something for everyone. Lee Redmond, 68, of Salt Lake City, Utah, earned the top berth for longest fingernails after not cutting them from 1979 onward. As of the last record-setting measurement, her nails were 28-foot long in total, the longest being her left index fingernail that came in at 3-foot, Claxton said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The lawyer who represented Lindsay Lohan in her lying-to-cops case last week is under investigation for suspicion of witness tampering, a source close to the investigation said Monday. Santa Monica police are investigating New York lawyer Mark Heller on suspicion of asking Lohan's personal assistant, who was in the car with the actress when she was involved in a car crash last June, to lie in his testimony by saying he had control of the Porsche when it crashed into a dump truck, the source said. The Santa Monica city attorney asked the city's police to investigate, according to the source, who asked not to be identified since the source is not authorized to discuss it with news media. Photos: Celebrity mugshots . ""I can sum it up in one word: ridiculous,"" Heller said when asked for a comment. ""What can I tell you?"" Heller was in a Los Angeles courtroom with Lohan, 26, last week when she agreed to enter a no-contest plea on the charges of misdemeanor charges of lying to police, reckless driving and violating her probation for shoplifting conviction. The judge sentenced Lohan to 90 days in a ""locked in"" drug rehab facility in lieu of a 90-day jail term. Her probation was also extended by two years. Her father, Michael Lohan, accused Heller of unethical and criminal conduct in his representation of his daughter after last week's hearing, saying prosecutors were investigating Heller for tampering with ""a star witness.""

The actress has appeared in court at least 21 times before four Los Angeles judges who have now found her in violation of probation six times and sentenced her to a total of nine months in jail.

"Lexington, Missouri (CNN) -- Police arrested a sixth member of a Missouri family under investigation for allegations of child sexual abuse, police said. Darrel Mohler has been charged with two counts of rape, Lafayette County Sheriff Kerrick Alumbaugh said at a news conference. Missouri police did not have Mohler in custody earlier. On the request of Missouri officials, Marion County authorities went to Mohler's home in Silver Springs, Florida, and caught him just before he pulled into the driveway, according to a news release from the Marion County Sheriff's Office. He was subsequently arrested. Mohler told police he ""was aware of what was going on in Missouri,"" and that he had not been there since the 1980s, according to the sheriff's office. Five members of the Mohler family of Lafayette County, Missouri, were arrested earlier this week after six alleged victims, who are relatives of the five suspects, made accusations of sexual abuse. A sixth person, described as an ""associate"" of the family, was arrested Thursday but released Friday, police said. The six alleged victims -- all now adults -- came to law enforcement authorities with stories of sexual performances, mock weddings, rape with various objects and a forced abortion during their childhoods, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City. CNN does not identify alleged sexual assault victims. Police did not have enough to charge Darrel Mohler earlier, but after examining the victims' statements, obtained enough information to charge him, Alumbaugh said. He added that he does not think Darrel is on the run. Darrel Mohler, 72, is the younger brother of Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, according to KSHB. On Tuesday, authorities arrested Mohler Sr. and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47. More charges against the family members are expected next week, the sheriff said. Current charges for some of the arrested include rape, deviate sexual assault and use [of] child in sexual performance, according to Missouri State Courts online case management system. Alumbaugh said that Larry Kidd, 55, of Kansas City, Missouri -- an ""associate"" of the Mohler family -- was picked up by police following a tip, cooperated with police and has been released. The alleged abuse took place from the mid-1980s until 1995 and possibly beyond, the sheriff said earlier. The documents provide graphic details of the alleged abuse provided by one of the alleged victims. All of the charges stem from those documents, Alumbaugh said. Mohler Sr., David Mohler and Jared Mohler are all lay ministers in the Community of Christ, the Independence, Missouri-based organization said in a statement. Lay ministers are volunteers who do not receive compensation, said the organization, and none of the three served in leadership roles or worked with children. Mohler Sr. went through the group's registered youth worker program, but ""his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs,"" the statement said. Some lay ministers might help take care of the church, while others might speak at services, said the organization's spokeswoman, Linda Booth. The Community of Christ is an offshoot of the modern-day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It split off from the Mormon church in the 1800s, and in 2000 changed its name to Community of Christ from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Investigators earlier this week searched several properties for evidence, but there were no plans to continue the searches, Alumbaugh said Friday. He declined to comment on any evidence found.

"(EW.com) -- Since everything about ""Les Misérables"" is fortissimo — including but not limited to its unabashed pursuit of awards that are shiny or globular or both — you have perhaps already heard a little about the movie now storming the Bastille of your wallet. You may already know that to make his movie adaptation of the internationally popular theatrical musical conjured from the 19th-century political novel by Victor Hugo, director Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech"") bade his actors sing live during filming. You probably already know that Anne Hathaway, as the wretched single mother-turned-prostitute Fantine, is reputedly a formidable Oscar favorite for her sobbing and warbling and haircutting-in-real-time. You've learned, from posters and trailers, that Hugh Jackman, as former convict Jean Valjean, looks impressively stricken and that Russell Crowe, as implacable police inspector Javert, looks disconcertingly dyspeptic. What's left to learn is this: ""Les Misérables"" provides compelling reasons for Crowe to be peeved, beginning with the humiliation of having to sing Broadway-style, when it clearly is so not his thing, and ending with the Cap'n Crunch wardrobe into which the gentleman is packed. (O, for Crowe's costumed glory days in ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World!"") Jackman has a right to be cranky too, although he's too much of a trouper to show it as he overemotes on demand and sings of finding God after he steals a pair of candlesticks from a nice priest. (Long story.) Hathaway looks happy enough channeling Liza Minnelli for her tremulous rendition of the Susan Boyle-appropriated anthem ''I Dreamed a Dream,'' but that's no doubt because she knows that soon after the song, she's pretty much done for the night. Ricky Gervais' 'Derek' trailer posted . Shall I go on about all the ways in which this fake-opulent ""Les Miz"" made me long for guillotines while millions of viewers who have softer, more generous hearts than I may swoon with money's-worth contentment? (At least it doesn't skimp on length: The movie is approximately as long as the 1832 Paris uprising it depicts.) Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter mug and prance as the comic-relief grifters Thénardier and his missus, outfitted in what has become de rigueur for both BCs — Pétrouchka makeup and prosthetically grungy teeth. Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne play the young lovers Cosette (Fantine's muppet daughter, raised by Valjean) and the boy-band-styled student revolutionary Marius like lab rats, their pale faces and lashless eyelids often observed in the merciless close-up that is one of Hooper's mix-it-up signature shots. (He is similarly devoted to tilted perspective and the room-at-a-45-degree-angle shot.) 'Hobbit' at No. 1 for second week: $36.7M . It's a daunting challenge, to be sure, to turn a big musical into a viable movie. For every great ""Cabaret,"" ""My Fair Lady,"" and ""The King and I,"" there's a dud ""Rent,"" ""Evita,"" and ""Mamma Mia!"" But this steam-driven military weapon of an enterprise is a sobering reminder of just how tinny a musical ""Les Misérables"" was in the first place — the listless music and lyrics by Alain Boubil, Claude-Michel Schönberg, and Herbert Kretzmer, the derivative characters fashioned from ""Oliver!"" scraps. And even if you do come to Mr. Hooper's neighborhood loving the show, having seen seven stage productions and named your cat Gavroche after the urchin who hitches his fate to those of grown-up revolutionaries, well, you're in for a gobsmacking: This ''prestige'' production is at heart a minor road-show carnival, leaving behind little but tinsel as it rumbles through the streets of Awardstown.

"(EW.com) -- Apparently the Truffula Valley is a much better training ground for the box office than Mars, as ""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax"" had no trouble fending off Disney's expensive new sci-fi arrival ""John Carter."" Universal's ""The Lorax"" dropped a relatively mild 44 percent for $39.1 million in its second weekend -- a drop that virtually replicates the second-weekend decline of 45 percent for 2008â€²s ""Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!"" Today ""The Lorax"" will pass ""The Vow"" to become the year's top grosser, finishing the weekend with a cumulative tally of nearly $122 million in just 10 days. But the real story here, of course, is ""John Carter,"" which Disney infamously spent $250 million to produce. With that kind of price tag, ""Carter"" really needed to open to $50 million at a bare minimum. Other films that reportedly cost around $250 million include ""Spider-Man 3,"" ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,"" and ""Avatar,"" and those four movies debuted to an average of $99 million. ""John Carter,"" on the other hand, collected an estimated $30.6 million this weekend. That's slightly better than the $25 million or so that most in the industry were predicting, and would represent a solid start for many films. But it's a dismal showing for such a costly project. Both the movie and its marketing campaign are to blame for the soft opening. The film, which garnered mixed reviews and marked the first live-action undertaking for Pixar's Andrew Stanton (""Finding Nemo,"" ""WALL-E""), is based on Tarzan author Edgar Rice Burroughs' 1917 book ""A Princess of Mars."" That book was the first in a series of Barsoom sci-fi novels that later influenced films such as ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar."" However, since the general public is not overly familiar with the Barsoom works, ""John Carter"" appeared derivative of the very things it inspired. Also not helping the movie out was its cast, headed by an unproven Taylor Kitsch (""Friday Night Lights""). True, ""Avatar"" featured the similarly untested Sam Worthington, but James Cameron's name is as big as any movie star, and he at least surrounded Worthington with some familiar faces like Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Rodriguez. The most familiar face in ""John Carter"" was... Mark Strong? But it's really Disney's marketing that performed a disservice to the movie. For months, ""John Carter"" suffered from muddled ads and trailers, none more misjudged than its Super Bowl commercial, which wrongly assumed audiences were so familiar with the ""John Carter"" brand that simply seeing the movie's title would excite them. Also hurting matters was the generic title, which Disney shortened from ""John Carter of Mars"" with the reported belief that ""of Mars"" would turn off female moviegoers. But Mars is the project's major selling point. Without it, the movie became a sphinx to the general public. Who is John Carter? Where is he? Why can he leap great distances? I understand the desire to not reveal too much of a film's story, but these are basic questions that weren't answered by Disney's advertising until right before ""John Carter's"" release. By then, it was too late. The film tilted toward men, whom Disney says comprised 63 percent of the audience. It also skewed a bit older than one might expect a PG-13 sci-fi adventure would, with 59 percent of the audience over age 25. Showings in 3-D represented 64 percent of the movie's gross. And audiences generally liked ""John Carter,"" with CinemaScore participants giving it a ""B+"" rating. One CinemaScore finding is particularly worth noting: Only 8 percent of those polled said Taylor Kitsch was their reason for buying a ticket. Compare that number to 72 percent for ""Safe House"" star Denzel Washington. The week's two other new releases, ""Silent House"" and ""A Thousand Words,"" didn't make much of an impression. ""Silent House,"" an R-rated shot-in-one-take horror flick starring Elizabeth Olsen, debuted to a quiet $7 million and virtually tied ""Act of Valor"" for fourth place. What it will be remembered for most, though, is its ""F"" CinemaScore rating. ""Silent House"" becomes the second film branded with the dreaded grade this year, joining ""The Devil Inside"" -- a CinemaScore ""F"" now seems specifically reserved for horror films with unsatisfying endings. ""A Thousand Words,"" which opened in sixth place with $6.4 million, was another misfire for star Eddie Murphy. The $40 million comedy was shot in 2008 and intended for a 2009 release, but was held up for three years when DreamWorks split from Paramount. Now, it has the distinction of joining Murphy's other recent flops: 2008â€²s ""Meet Dave"" and 2009â€²s ""Imagine That,"" which debuted to $5.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively. Among holdovers, the R-rated teen party flick ""Project X"" fared surprisingly well, slipping only 45 percent for $11.6 million. That duplicates the trajectory of ""Chronicle,"" another ""found-footage"" film starring teenagers, which dropped 45 percent its second weekend. And ""Act of Valor"" fell 48 percent for $7 million in its third weekend, pushing its total gross to $56.1 million. In limited release, the R-rated ensemble comedy ""Friends With Kids,"" starring Adam Scott, Jennifer Westfeldt, Megan Fox, and a quarter of ""Bridesmaids"" alums (Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Jon Hamm, and Chris O'Dowd), had a so-so debut with $2.2 million from 374 theaters. That equates to a per-location average of $5,799. The Ewan McGregor-Emily Blunt romantic dramedy ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" reeled in $240,000 at 18 theaters, while the Oscar-nominated Israeli drama ""Footnote"" took in $48,100 at two locations. 1.

"Alpharetta, Georgia (CNN) -- His ramrod straight posture and slicked-back buzz cut give it away. Steve Venable is a boot camp veteran. But today, he's drilling his rookies for perhaps the most challenging mission of their lives: fatherhood. One by one, an army of expectant dads files into Venable's classroom at Northside Hospital near Atlanta, hoping to gain some wisdom from the ex-Marine-turned-""daddy boot camp"" instructor. Stephen Goodnough arrived 20 minutes early, admittedly tense. His baby girl is due in less than a month. ""I've never babysat, I've never taken care of a child, so that's probably why I've been nervous,"" he said. Goodnough has the crib, the nursery, the bottles and the bibs. But he hasn't a clue about what to actually do with the baby. ""It's not like they're power tools,"" said Goodnough, a marketing manager for NAPA auto parts. ""They don't come with instruction manuals. It's a kid, a human life. ... You leave the hospital, and that's it."" He's among some 300,000 expectant dads who have turned to Boot Camp for New Dads, a program now in 45 states as well as Britain, Canada, Italy and Japan. The course started in 1990 near a Marine base in California, and has grown despite declining attendance in childbirth classes nationwide as more parents turn to the Internet. Boot camps now take place everywhere from affluent communities to low-income neighborhoods and even a prison in Ohio. ""I'd say it's more important in low-income communities. The role models have more impact there,"" said Greg Bishop, founder of Boot Camp for New Dads. In three hours, the men in this boot camp learn a battery of ""troubleshooting and diagnostics,"" including how to swaddle and soothe a crying baby, change a loaded diaper and deal with the mother during and after pregnancy. Bob Meecham's baby isn't due until January 29, but the anxiety is already evident on his face. ""I know what I'm most scared of. I'm most scared of 4 a.m. in the morning, and the baby not being able to stop crying for two hours. What do you do?"" With 10 men surrounding a brightly colored mat and blanket on the floor, Venable, a father of two, issues a disclaimer: . ""I'm not a doctor. I don't play one on TV, and I didn't stay in a hotel last night. I'm just a dude,"" the instructor said. His assistant today is 1-month-old Anabella, daughter of recent boot camp graduate John Riley. Within minutes, Anabella morphed from smiling and tranquil to irritated and screaming. ""You've got a set of lungs on you,"" Venable said as he lay her down on the blanket. After a few swift motions with the cloth, Venable picked up the tightly wrapped infant and held her on her side, parallel to his chest. ""SHHH,"" he blew loudly across her cheek. Less than six seconds later, wailing Anabella fell silent in Venable's sturdy arms. ""It's like magic!"" one rookie exclaimed. In addition to hands-on demonstrations and training, in this room, no subject is off limits. Females over 2 feet tall are not allowed, so men can share their concerns freely -- particularly about how to handle their mates. ""This class was my idea because I wanted something to help me learn to deal with her,"" Meecham said, echoing other husbands' concerns about their wives. ""She's going through a lot."" Venable addresses a variety of mother-related topics, including how to help during labor, how to spot signs of postpartum depression and how to gain her trust as a caretaker. ""The biggest challenge the dad has is establishing enough credibility so that mom will relinquish control,"" he said. ""If you don't have the hands-on skills, and you don't have knowledge of the (baby's) cues ... it will be very hard to come to any kind of arrangement and have any kind of credibility. Those who don't have those skills tend to get treated as secondary parents. They'll feel sort of left out."" He said other topics men often reserve for boot camp include sex, discomfort with changing diapers and finances. Venable, who spent four years in the Marines, is among a network of experienced dads who have graduated from daddy boot camp and have come back as instructors. ""People who know me think it's either absolutely odd or encouraging that I'm doing this on my off time,"" Venable said. But there are parallels between the Marines and daddy boot camp, he said. ""When you look at military people, they look at critical skill sets. Once they learn what those skill sets are, they practice, practice, practice until they perfect them."" He said the same holds true for quieting a bawling baby by swaddling, or wrapping a baby snugly in a blanket to mimic the feeling inside the womb. Riley, Anabella's father, said he also returned to boot camp to help pay forward what he learned. ""It was such a help for me, I knew if I brought her in it would help everyone else,"" the executive search firm owner said. Dressed in a crisp white shirt and stylish watch, Riley looks more prepared for business than a daddy boot camp, until you see the pink Snoopy blanket in tow. He said he didn't expect to be such a hands-on father, figuring he'd primarily work while his wife took care of most baby issues. ""Once I had the baby, that completely changed my perspective on everything,"" he said. ""I love it, she's so much fun. It's more work than I expected, but anytime I look at her face, it relieves all my problems."" Before long, Anabella produced her second dirty diaper of the class. ""OK -- next victim,"" Venable said. A few groans sounded across the room as Meecham stepped up to the plate, cautiously removing a loaded diaper for the first time. ""I was like, oh man, don't twist the baby's ankle, make sure you get it clean all the way around,"" he said. By the end of the boot camp, Meecham also learned how to feed Anabella.

"New York (CNN) -- New York City officials will begin sifting through soil for human remains Tuesday at a site where a part believed to be from one of the 9/11 airliners was found. A Boeing Company technician confirmed that the piece, discovered last week, is a support structure from a trailing edge flap found on the wing of a Boeing 767 like the ones that were flown into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. It could not be determined from which of the two planes the part came, police said Monday. The piece was found in an 18-inch gap between two buildings near ground zero. One of the buildings is 51 Park Place, the site of a controversial Islamic community center. Surveyors who found the piece called authorities to report that they'd found ""apparently damaged machinery,"" police said. Contrary to an initial theory that the piece could have been lowered by a rope found still wrapped to it, the police department clarified Monday that a police officer had attached the rope last week to maneuver the part to better see a serial number and other indicators. The plane part is about 5 feet long, 4 feet wide and 17 inches deep, police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. Investigators are still trying to determine how the support structure became wedged into such a small space. ""If you see how confined this space is, and you realize the chaos that existed on this street, I think it's understandable. It's not that surprising,"" Kelly said. ""It's very, very confined, and no construction work went on, or no clean up went on in this 18-inch space between the two buildings"" after the attacks. Still identifying 9/11 victims' remains . Family members upset . Some family members of 9/11 victims are outraged by the discovery. Sally Regenhard, whose son Christian, a probationary firefighter, died when the towers collapsed, said: ""I'm disgusted, because after 9/11, the proper search was never done. The whole aftermath was uncoordinated. It was inadequate."" Regenhard has been one of the leading voices and, at times, critics for the families of the 9/11 victims, pushing hard for a federal investigation and calling for a more comprehensive search for remains and debris. ""We advocated for a huge trajectory from that collapse,"" she said. ""Human remains were thrown at least for a mile, but probably 2 or 3 miles from the site."" Police are treating the area as a crime scene and say the part of wreckage will remain there until a final home is chosen. In the past, the National Transportation Safety Board has taken some parts, while others have become part of museums. Sharif El-Gamal, president of Soho Properties, which owns 51 Park Place, said, ""We are cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities to make sure this piece of evidence is removed with care as quickly and effectively as possible."" This is not the first time this building has had national attention. It was the center of many protests while Park 51, the Islamic center, was seeking permission to locate there in 2010. Critics said the center's proximity to ground zero was unacceptable, while supporters argued it was meant to bring people together. Waiting for a match . In recent years, debris and human remains have been discovered in various spots around Lower Manhattan. In the past few weeks, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has been sifting through 590 cubic yards of construction debris from around the World Trade Center collected as recently as 2011. Close to 100 pieces of potential human remains have been found since the new sifting operation began. The medical examiner will now try to identify these remains using DNA. About 60% of the more than 2,700 victims have had remains identified. Some victim's family members are hopeful that this new pile of construction debris will contain the match they still wait for. ""It'll be difficult. All the emotions, all the thoughts come rushing back to you. It would be a relief to know that these sacred remains are no longer sitting in a landfill somewhere,"" said Michael Burke who lost his brother, Fire Department Captain William Burke Jr. Yet not all family members are anxiously waiting for the phone to ring. ""I really didn't want to find anything out, anything after a certain point in time because it would only be rehashing things all over again,"" said Paulette Hasson, who lost her son Joseph, an employee of the firm Cantor Fitzgerald. ""He's in a good place I'm sure and some day I'll see him, and I just feel like this is not something that I want to deal with right now. I don't feel that it will do anything for me if they find a bone fragment."" The total number of victims whose remains have been identified stands at 1,635, according to the Medical Examiner's office. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Rob Frehse, Chris Kokenes, Mary Snow and Steve Kastenbaum contributed to this report.","Boeing confirms that the part is from a 767 like the ones that hit the World Trade Center .

"(CNN) -- Anna Tsuchiya is one of Japan's most recognized young stars. Model, mother, actress and singer: Tsuchiya is living her life her own way. Born in Tokyo in 1984 to a Japanese mother and an American father, as a teenager, Anna started modeling, gracing the pages of fashion magazines. That later led to an acting career, starring in such movies as ""Kamikaze Girls"" and ""Sakuran."" Taking on non-traditional female roles is something Tsuchiya enjoys, as mush because it fits in with here own self image as a bit of an outsider. ""It's fun to act that kind of character who is said by others to be a 'bad girl' but in fact she has a good heart, and that fits me,"" she told CNN's Kyung Lah. ""It would be good if many people could establish good relations in their dealings with others by pure and genuine relations rather than what is on the surface. That is the reason I am fond of acting such characters."" More recently, Anna been taking to the stage, as a punk rock singer. ""My music might have an image of  being 'hard' but in fact it expresses human emotions. So it is different from the surface image and it expresses deeper messages which have emerged from inside, "" she said. With her twin career as actress and singer, she has become something of a role model for young Japanese, especially as her life and work are far removed from the traditional role for Japanese women. ""There is an image of women by which someone dictates how it should be. Nobody could say 'yes' to that image as the right model. We only get one life. I am a woman but I am doing and want to do things that I feel are cool,"" she told CNN. Since becoming a mother three years ago, Tsuchiya has developed a more mature attitude to life: ""What has changed very much is that I before I had my baby I lived just for myself. But now the child is more important than myself."" Her more sanguine attitude was compounded by tragedy when her ex-husband died in May 2008. ""Death is a sad thing but it has to happen and time can never be reversed. I happen to think that when I die I don't want to see people around weeping forever. I think he would have felt the same way,"" she told CNN. ""So if I had been caught up with sorrow he would have been upset. Rather than being overcome, I say I accept the reality."" Despite the setback and tragedies, with Tsuchiya's unique career in the ascendancy, her future looks bright.","Anna Tsuchiya is one of Japan's most recognizable actresses and singers .

"CANTON, Mississippi (In Session/CNN) -- A Mississippi middle school teacher could face the death penalty after she was found guilty Tuesday of fatally shooting and stabbing her lover's pregnant fiancee in 2006. Carla Hughes taught at the same middle school as the victim's fiancé, Keyon Pittman. Carla Hughes, 28, sobbed loudly as a judge read the verdicts on two counts of capital murder for the deaths of Avis Banks and her unborn child. The jury also found the slayings occurred during the commission of a burglary, making Hughes eligible for the death penalty. A jury of nine women and three men are due to return to Madison County Circuit Court Wednesday morning to decide if Hughes should be executed for killing Banks, who was five months pregnant. Their verdict must be unanimous or Hughes will receive a life sentence. Mississippi is among the states that consider murdering a pregnant woman to be taking two lives. Madison County district attorneys alleged Hughes killed Banks so she could be with Keyon Pittman, her lover and colleague at Chastain Middle School in Jackson, Mississippi.  Watch the jury find Carla Hughes guilty » . Banks, 27, was found lying in a pool of blood on November 29, 2006, in the garage of the Ridgeland home she shared with Pittman, the father of her unborn child. She had been shot four times in the leg, chest and head, and then stabbed multiple times in the face and neck as she lay dying, according to medical testimony. Suspicion initially fell on Pittman, who admitted to having an affair with Hughes, a language arts teacher. Pittman, a key prosecution witness, told the jury he began seeing Hughes one month after finding out his girlfriend was pregnant. He testified that the two met frequently in Hughes' home and even went out of town together, but he insisted the relationship was based solely on sex. Throughout the trial, defense lawyers maintained her innocence and attempted to cast blame on Pittman, portraying him as a womanizer seeking to avoid the burden of fatherhood. But prosecutors said they could not link the crime to Pittman, who testified that he invoked his right against self-incrimination during a preliminary hearing when asked where he was the afternoon his fiancée was killed. Instead, prosecutors alleged that the murder weapons connected Hughes to the crime. The defendant's cousin testified that he lent her a knife and a loaded .38 caliber revolver the weekend before Banks' death. Ballistics tests matched the bullets from Banks' body to the gun, which Hughes returned unloaded to her cousin after her first interview with police. Madison County District Attorney Michael Guest said Banks' relatives plan to deliver victim impact statements at the sentencing. He said medical testimony will be presented to support the prosecution's claim that the murders were gruesome and heinous, and warrant the death penalty. Hughes' lawyer, Johnnie E. Walls, Jr., a Mississippi state senator, said her relatives will testify in a bid to spare her life.","Mississippi jury convicts Carla Hughes of two counts of capital murder on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- As an NBA executive, I'm always looking for untapped potential. As a proud native of Nigeria, I believe that Africa is one of the world's greatest resources in that area. From Angola and Tunisia to Senegal and South Sudan, there is so much size and athletic ability across the continent. Some tribes in Sudan and Senegal have an average height of 6-foot-6, which also happens to be the size of the average NBA player. People in Nigeria, Mali and Congo tend to be very big and physical. We need to build a strategy to go into these regions and cultivate the talent through infrastructure and instruction. Not long ago, soccer in Africa was almost the same way. It was untapped. Kids in Africa start kicking a ball when they are six or seven years old, if not younger. It's like baseball, basketball and football in America. If you're talented, people will find you. That's what happened with soccer. The number of academies has grown rapidly, and people are really into it. As a result, nearly every major soccer team has a lot of African players. Through my experience as a Nigerian player, coach and now NBA executive, I believe basketball can follow a similar path. It starts with building facilities. We need to start investing in outdoor courts and indoor gyms for kids to play. From African Voices: Nigerian NBA boss finding basketball stars . Most kids in Africa don't start playing basketball until they are 13 or 14 years old. This puts them at a disadvantage because they lack the instincts and must work harder to develop the skills and habits formed at an early age. With a tremendous assist from the NBA, Nike and the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), we have been trying to provide opportunities for the next generation of African basketball players. Every year, we conduct the Giants of Africa camp, sponsored by NestlÃ© Milo and Nike, as well as the NBA Basketball Without Borders Africa elite camp. Nearly 100 campers have gone on to play college basketball in the United States, including Luc Mbah a Moute, who now plays for the Milwaukee Bucks. Mbah a Moute (Cameroon) is one of several African success stories. Serge Ibaka (Democratic Republic of Congo) is a rising star for the Oklahoma City Thunder, and Luol Deng (born in Sudan) was an All-Star last year for the Chicago Bulls. These guys are great examples for young people in Africa. Kids are beginning to see the possibilities because of the exposure of the NBA. It was unfortunate that Hakeem Olajuwon (Nigeria), Dikembe Mutombo (Congo) and Manute Bol (Sudan) -- three African giants -- came in an era before the internet, cable and satellite television. A lot of African kids have heard of these guys, but they don't know the scope of their accomplishments. Deng, Ibaka and Mbah a Moute are trying to become giants themselves, but they can't do it alone. Read related: Team Nigeria gears up for motorsports debut . Through the Sprite clinics and Basketball Without Borders, we've been to Congo, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Senegal, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. On a continent with more than a billion people, we still have a lot more ground to cover, and we need help from sponsors in Africa. We need more companies to help build courts and gymnasiums for kids to play. Nestle Milo paid for a world-class floor made in the United States. That's what we use for my Giants of Africa camp. For years, Nike has generously provided shoes and equipment for the players. That is the kind of support we need from influential investors in Africa. As you can probably tell, the push to develop talent in Africa is personal. I grew up there. I played there. I know how much talent there is. We have to concentrate on building facilities, establishing successful leagues and finding investors to help young players. America gave me the opportunity, but I truly believe Africa is going to be the next big thing. It is going to be prominent in tapping basketball talent. I really hope I'm alive to see it happen.

"(CNN) -- The rise of new and more affordable vaccines in recent years augurs well for the future and provides us with an opportunity to prevent sickness and save lives on a scale that was previously unimaginable. We now have vaccines to prevent nearly 30 diseases. The GAVI Alliance -- a public-private partnership focused on increasing access to vaccines in poor countries -- has contributed to the immunization of more than 370 million children since 2000. The World Health Organization estimates immunization programs prevent 2 million to 3 million deaths every year. WHO also estimates we have an opportunity to reach an additional 22 million infants who live in hard-to-reach or insecure communities across the developing world. Reaching these populations is the key to achieving humanitarian milestones agreed to by the global community -- chiefly, Millennium Development Goal 4, which calls for a significant reduction in child mortality by 2015. One major step toward this goal is also one of the greatest public health achievements of this millennium. In 1988, polio was a disease that crippled or killed more than 350,000 individuals every year, mostly children. Today, that figure has decreased by more than 99%. The disease is now endemic in only three countries -- Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. It more recently has reappeared in Kenya and Somalia, yet success has never been closer. The greatest legacy of the polio eradication movement might very well be the foundation for stronger health systems it creates. At the end of April, leaders attending the Global Vaccine Summit in Abu Dhabi signaled their confidence in a six-year plan to achieve a polio-free world by 2018. Together, they committed $4 billion, close to three quarters of the plan's $5.5 billion cost over the next six years. A key reason for their unprecedented support was the polio eradication program's contribution to the critical base of evidence, knowledge and expertise needed to reach the most marginalized communities in the developing world with a wide range of health interventions. This was also a vote of confidence in the outstanding and exceptional leadership of Bill Gates as well as the work of the members of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, the real rock stars who have stemmed the tide of polio. Robust social mobilization and the effective engagement of community leaders have been instrumental to success against polio and in building up the systems needed to reach our immunization and wider health goals. However, myths and misinformation, high illiteracy rates, extreme poverty, weak health systems, insecurity and poor infrastructure represent real barriers to polio immunization and the overall expansion of access to health care. Just this week, a female polio health worker was killed and another wounded in Pakistan. This follows on the heels of a series of attacks that have taken place on health workers in all three polio endemic countries. These are real challenges. Bekele Geleta, the secretary general of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, stated at the Vaccine Summit that ""we train health volunteers who live in the same communities, speak the same languages and are trusted by local populations. These strong community ties allow us to extend the ability of existing health systems to provide quality health care to underserved populations."" After decades of foreign aid, national investments and philanthropic giving that has produced an impressive record of results, we need a decisive win. The eradication of polio can galvanize support for the development and delivery of additional lifesaving vaccines and achieving universal immunization coverage. More importantly, the polio program provides a blueprint for other health and development initiatives that will increase access not only to vaccines, but also antibiotics, bed nets for malaria prevention, clean water, access to proper sanitation as well as reproductive health and other essential health services. With sustained funding and a commitment to community-led solutions, polio eradication will join a short list of heady, historical achievements that have united the world in solidarity. This would follow the charge led by another international public health hero, Dr. Larry Brilliant, who played a key role in WHO's smallpox eradication program. It would mark the second human infectious disease relegated to history books, and the first great humanitarian achievement of the 21st century. As health and policy experts debate the merits of earmarking investments for global health, they must remember one thing: vaccines are the most powerful and cost-effective tools available to improve child health and advance human development. By investing in the polio eradication program, we are paving a path that will deliver these and other life-saving services to areas of the world where they are needed most. The evidence is clear: Vaccines work. We owe it to ourselves to seize this opportunity for a healthier and disease-free world. More importantly, we owe it to our children.

"(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration advised concerned consumers Thursday to stop taking a popular cholesterol drug that may be contaminated with specks of glass if the pills came from one of 41 recalled lots. The recall of generic Lipitor was initiated nearly three weeks ago by Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals, but this is the first time the FDA -- or anyone else -- has told consumers to stop taking the drug. The FDA also announced Thursday that Ranbaxy would stop making atorvastatin while it investigates how the glass might have gotten into the drug. Even with these new guidelines, some pharmacies are still telling customers it's safe to take the drug. ""Patients should continue to proceed as they normally would,"" said Brian Henry, vice president of corporate communications at Express Scripts, on Thursday. He added that the company would not give customers refunds for the generic Lipitor, or atorvastatin. Cholesterol drug recalled over glass concerns . Henry explained that this was a ""pharmacy-level recall,"" meaning pharmacies must stop dispensing contaminated lots of the drug, but consumers could keep taking what they already had at home -- even though the FDA has confirmed that some of the contaminated drug may have reached consumers. Pharmacists at several CVS stores also told customers it was OK to keep taking Ranbaxy's atorvastatin but said they would replace the drug at a patient's request. ""This whole thing is confusing for consumers,"" said Lisa Gill, editor of prescription drugs at Consumer Reports. She also expressed concern that it took the FDA nearly three weeks to issue guidance to consumers. ""It's not clear why it took them so long,"" she said. ""It's surprising."" FDA spokeswoman Sarah Clark-Lynn declined to comment on the reasons behind the delay. Recall leaves glass-specked drug in hands of patients . In its statement Thursday, the FDA said that the glass particles were ""similar to the size of a grain of sand"" and that ""the possibility of adverse events related to the recalled product appear to be low."" Making matters potentially even more confusing, the FDA directed concerned consumers to call their pharmacies to see whether their pills had been recalled, as not all lots of the drug are effected. However, pharmacists say they have no way of figuring out what lot number a bottle of pills came from. ""The ability to tie a specific prescription to a lot number would be very difficult,"" said Ronna Hauser, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the National Community Pharmacists Association. Ranbaxy, India's largest pharmaceutical company and the 12th largest generics maker in the world, has had quality problems in the past. The FDA has accused the company of ""a pattern of systemic fraudulent conduct,"" including taking shortcuts in crucial quality tests. So widespread and grave was the misbehavior that in 2008 the FDA barred Ranbaxy from importing 30 drugs into the United States.","FDA: Consumers should stop taking generic Lipitor if pills came from recalled lot .

"(CNN) -- Disappointment, anger, disgust. Words like these are echoing throughout social media about a national icon: The Boy Scouts of America. To put it mildly, Scouting is going through a rough patch. In July, the BSA national headquarters clarified its ban on gays and lesbians -- leaving it in place and triggering a national movement by hundreds of former Eagle Scouts to renounce their rank and return their treasured medals. And then this week, the so-called ""perversion files"" were publicly released, naming more than 1,000 suspected child sex abusers since the mid-1960s with links to Scouting. All this has people asking questions: What's going on here? Is Scouting in trouble? Is it even relevant anymore? Although membership has remained steady at 2.7 million youths, many parents are taking a hard look at the organization -- especially its ban on gays, lesbians, atheists and agnostics, says former Eagle Scout Burke Stansbury, an online activist. ""Some of the aspects of Scouting morality I find is sort of old school -- like they're stuck in the 1950s."" It's become more acceptable, he says, for people to be atheist and agnostic and still be considered moral in our society. Also, ""attitudes around homosexuality have changed a lot in the last few decades, and the Boy Scouts' moral code hasn't kept up with those changes."" Here's how mainstream the idea of gay and lesbian Scouts has become: both President Obama and Mitt Romney support it. Obama, in fact, serves as honorary BSA president, a tradition held by every commander in chief since the group was founded. Eventually, the Boy Scouts will have to change, Stansbury says, or else the organization will become socially irrelevant. The group is standing at a key moment in its survival, says Stansbury. If it fails to ""get with the modern times"" within the next decade, ""alternative youth organizations will appear that are more inclusive and based on equality."" The majority of Scouts agree with the policy, the BSA said in July. But ""no single policy will accommodate the many diverse views among our membership or society."" Scouting offers to teach members skills in ""character building"" and making good ""moral choices,"" says BSA spokesman Deron Smith. But he also says it's important to separate ""the discussion of larger societal issues"" from the operation of Scouting. ""The state of Scouting is very strong."" 'Living your values' The idea is sometimes referred to as ""living your values"" -- in other words, interacting only with organizations and businesses that match your morals and ethics. ""People with young kids are trying to live their lives more in accordance with their beliefs and their values,"" says Stansbury. It's hard, he says, to participate in something like the Boy Scouts and everyday question your own integrity. In protest, Stansbury sent his Eagle medal back to Scout headquarters a few months ago, along with hundreds of other ex-Scouts. Read a blog written by ex-Scouts who've renounced their Eagle awards . Boy Scout policies and procedures evolve over time, says Smith. For example, the child sex abuse concerns decades ago spurred the BSA to implement strict screening, education and prevention policies that continue today and represent a ""gold standard"" for protecting kids, Smith says. Boy Scout Zach Plante of Menlo Park, California, doesn't like the ban on atheists or gays and lesbians. But he loves Scouting. So the 16-year-old basically looks the other way, he says, along with the rest of Troop 222. ""In my troop I don't know of any particular Scouts that are gay or atheist, but I know that our troop wouldn't necessarily kick a Scout out of the troop for being gay or atheist."" Zach's dad, psychology professor Tom Plante, doesn't see any conflict between his support for Scouting and his opposition to the bans. Plante says he does his best to live his values and to make changes where he can. ""But at the end of the day we're not going to agree 100% with all the policies and procedures of every organization that we're a part of -- whether it's Scouts or the United States government or churches or companies."" Related: Boy Scouts feel a mother's wrath . Ryan Andreson's troop wasn't so understanding. When Andreson, who lives in Moraga, California, was denied his Eagle rank because he's gay, he mounted a campaign that gained national attention. Part of that campaign included collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures on a petition for local Scout officials. So far, Andreson is still waiting to get his Eagle. What if Scouting disappeared? You'd likely see more than $206,000,000 worth of yearly services and charity fundraising provided by Scout groups disappear, according to BSA. Religious ties . Many critics who accuse the Scouts of failing to change with the times blame BSA's deep connections to organized religion. Approximately 70% of Scout troops are affiliated with some kind of church or religious group, says Smith. Among the biggest backers are the Catholic Church and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, according to BSA. In 2011, Mormon-backed Cub Scout and Boy Scout units accounted for more than 420,000 of all Scouts nationwide, while more than 200,000 other scouts were members of units affiliated with the Catholic Church. Links with religious groups are ""definitely part of our longstanding tradition,"" says Smith. ""Our policies and procedures and everything that we are is definitely reflected by our membership and our charter organization partners."" Boy Scouts claim kids safer with them than at home . Those affiliations over the years have resulted in a complicated political maze that's difficult to navigate when it comes to change, Stansbury suggests. ""Oh yeah -- the Catholic and Mormon churches have a lot of influence on the Boy Scouts, especially the leadership of the Boy Scouts,"" he says. ""I certainly believe that's a big part of why the Boy Scouts have stubbornly held onto this policy. ""It would be a much better organization, not having those people involved. But it's not going to go away immediately."" There's also dissent among leaders inside Scouting -- although many keep a low profile. One Scout leader, who asked to remain anonymous because he fears losing his position, posted comments on a private online message board for Eagle alums. If the U.S. military can accept openly gay and lesbian troops, he asked, why can't the Boy Scouts of America? ""Every day I question my personal integrity for choosing to stay involved with a discriminatory organization."" So -- does America still need the Boy Scouts? Is it still culturally relevant as it enters its second century of service? Will the BSA make it to 200 years? What do you think?

"(CNN) -- The San Francisco Police Department is reopening a 25-year-old homicide that may be linked to convicted killer Richard Ramirez, known during his 1984-85 spree as the ""Night Stalker."" Richard Ramirez, known as the ""Night Stalker,"" is awaiting execution in California. Detectives recently obtained a warrant to test Ramirez's DNA based on new leads in the 1984 death of 9-year-old Mei Leung, who was sexually assaulted and killed in the basement of her home in the city's Tenderloin district, police said. ""There are no charges at this time,"" explained David Shinn, deputy director of the Bureau of Investigation. Inspectors went to San Quentin Prison, where Ramirez is awaiting execution, to get the DNA sample. Ramirez was convicted in 1985 of 13 murders -- 11 in Southern California and two others in the San Francisco area -- along with five attempted murders, 11 sexual assaults and 14 burglaries. Ramirez, a professed ""satanist,"" was dubbed the ""Night Stalker"" for his preference of breaking into houses in the wee hours of the morning. His brutal string of attacks, many of them on elderly couples, terrified Southern California. His preferred method of attack was to quickly kill the male and rape -- sometimes repeatedly -- the female after ransacking the home for valuables. Some of his victims survived and provided descriptions, but police were unable to name a suspect. After an attack in San Francisco in August 1985, however, police finally got a break. A Tenderloin hotel manager recognized the descriptions as a man who had stayed at the hotel periodically for a year and a half. Ramirez had already left San Francisco, however, and attacked again in Los Angeles on August 24. A week later, Ramirez took a bus from Tucson, Arizona, where he'd been visiting his brother, and was recognized from his picture, now gracing the cover of newspapers, at a store near the downtown Los Angeles bus station. He fled and was finally brought down by residents of an east Los Angeles neighborhood who recognized him as he tried to steal two cars. They held him down until police arrived. Mei Leung's death was an open case for 25 years until what police described as new information pointed to Ramirez as a possible suspect. One of the investigators, Inspector Holly Pera, was just starting with the department when the girl was slain. ""It is the type of case as a new officer that you don't forget,"" Pera said. She and her partner, Inspector Joseph Toomey, have had the case for a couple of years. Police said the family of the dead girl were notified of the developments and were described as being grateful that the crime is still being investigated. Ramirez, sentenced to die in 1989, later married a woman who wrote him some 75 letters after his capture.","Detectives recently obtained a warrant to test Ramirez's DNA .

"(CNN) -- After a year of national gridlock that ended on the precipice of a cliff, Donald Trump went nuclear. The man who called Barack Obama's re-election a travesty said Republicans could gain control of the budget showdown because they ""are sitting there with a nuclear weapon"": the specter of voting against a rise in the debt ceiling in the coming weeks. In other words, the GOP could get its way by again threatening to push the country into default. The remarkable thing here is not Trump's apocalyptic advice but that the man who still doesn't concede that the president was born in Hawaii draws attention no matter what he says. The colorful businessman has a knack for hijacking the media -- and he's hardly alone. Watch: Hey Fox, Hillary Clinton was sick after all . In fact, one of the most striking developments in recent years is how easy it is to carry out the hijacking. You don't need a weapon, nuclear or otherwise. You don't have to be a famous zillionaire to pull it off. In the Twitter age, almost anyone can capture the spotlight for 15 seconds. We're so easy. If it's new, novel or naughty, we are there. A critical mass of tweeters hijacked the presidential debates by turning Big Bird and ""binders full of women"" into trending topics. What, you thought what was most important was what the candidates said during those 90-minute face-offs? Nope, it's just as much about winning the post-game chatter. A single ""oops"" by Rick Perry enables the press to wipe out everything else that was said. Watch: Are critics being too harsh on Chelsea Clinton? Clint Eastwood, telling Obama (in the guise of an empty chair) to perform an anatomically impossible act? That hijacked Mitt Romney's convention. Eric Fehrnstrom inadvertently hijacked his boss' campaign when he compared Romney's election strategy to an Etch A Sketch. Nothing like a kid's toy to seize the attention of grown-up journalists. Any invocation of a celebrity has great hijacking potential, even if the story is a sprinkling of fairy dust. The political press recently surrendered to the notion that Ben Affleck might run for John Kerry's Senate seat in Massachusetts. This was based on nothing more than local chatter, amplified by Politico. Affleck shrewdly kept the door ajar -- such speculation helps in the gravitas department --but on Christmas Eve, he gave the press a lump of coal by admitting he wasn't running. Watch: Were the media swept away by fiscal cliff madness? Next the media got excited by the idea that Ted Kennedy Jr. would run for office -- until he quickly popped that trial balloon. Sometimes the hijacker wants no part of the limelight but is swept along for the ride. Paula Broadwell was embedded in the nation's consciousness for weeks after her affair with David Petraeus prompted his resignation as CIA director. And her romantic rival, Jill Kelley, became a captive as well. Racial tension can grab the media's attention like few other issues. There are more than 15,000 murders annually in the United States, but only a few move beyond local headlines. The killing of Trayvon Martin, initially overlooked even in Florida, became a national sensation once activists persuaded the media that race played a role in the teenager's shooting (a perception deepened by NBC's misleading editing of George Zimmerman's 911 call). Week after week of routine murders in cities such as Chicago barely register on the radar. WATCH: Forget the Fiscal Cliffâ€”Kim Kardashian Is Pregnant! Most journalists gravitate toward sensational and sexy stories (and I haven't been immune to the temptation) because we want the clicks and the ratings. And perhaps to alleviate our own boredom with the daily grunt work of reporting. The on-and-off negotiations over the fiscal cliff have been tedious and incremental. Along comes Trump and boom, you've got an easy headline. The problem with all this media hijacking goes beyond the strange twists and turns along the way. It's that we cede control of what's important. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: Donald Trump said the GOP can go nuclear in budget showdown .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Eight Chinese officials have been fired or suspended after five boys died in a rubbish bin after suffocating on fumes from charcoal they burned to stay warm, according to state-run media. The bodies of the boys, aged between 9 and 13, were found by a trash collector on Friday in Bijie in China's southwestern Guizhou province, Xinhua reported. They are believed to have died the night before, as rain fell and temperatures plunged to as low as six degrees Celsius (43 degrees Fahrenheit). Six officials have lost their jobs, including the principals of two local schools and four government officials in charge of education and civil affairs in Qixingguan district where Bijie is located. Two deputy heads from the same departments were also suspended pending an investigation. Users on China's social media platforms expressed shock and disgust, with some questioning how society could have allowed such young children to fall through the cracks. One user on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, wrote: ""China is supposedly an intermediate developed country but still can't protect its own children. At the age when they should be enjoying a happy childhood these poor kids are wandering and dying on the streets."" (@Datounaonao) Another said: ""I just can't believe this is a story happening in my country today...where are the ""relevant departments"" doing on this? And ""where are the kids' parents? Why give birth to children and then abandon them?"" (@Dongsir) Days after their deaths, details of the boys' lives emerged in local press. They all belonged to the same extended family, the sons of three brothers. Two of the fathers, Tao Yuanwu and Tao Xueyuan, were rural migrants, who had moved from Guizhou to the special economic zone of Shenzhen near the Hong Kong border, where they worked as rubbish collectors. The other father, Tao Jinyou, a poor man who was said to work long hours tending fields, told Xinhua that he and his wife paid little attention to their own son, let alone their nephews. ""Sometimes they didn't even come home at night,"" he said. Persistent truants, the boys were said to have been missing for three weeks before they were found dead. ""At first, I sent (my son) back to school by force,"" Tao said. ""But every time he'd run away again, so I knew it was hopeless."" There are estimated to be more than 150,000 street children in China, according to official figures quoted by Xinhua. However, Dale Rutstein of UNICEF China said up to 1.5 million children were thought to be fending for themselves across the country but, given the fluid nature of homelessness, it was hard to keep track. Rutstein says the presence of street children is obvious in some cities, but it's safe to assume that many remain in rural towns, the byproduct of a huge demographic shift in China, as parents move to booming cities for work. ""It's not uncommon to see several children living in a household with an elderly couple in rural China. These are the left behind children. Right now people are coping the best they can,"" Rutstein said. It's estimated there are 55 million ""left behind"" children in China, the sons and daughters of 200 million migrant workers who have moved to the cities for a better life. ""We would say in UNICEF that that's one of the most significant challenges for China right now, because all the data shows these children have lower nutrition, suffer a higher rate of accidents and injuries and are at greater risk of abuse and exploitation,"" Rutstein said. State media reported that four of the five boys found dead in the dumpster were being cared for by their aging, blind grandmother who had difficulty caring for herself. A local resident told CCTV that neighbors had noticed the boys wandering the streets. ""They took a shabby shed in a construction site near the dumpster and ate some discarded vegetables in the market and played football that they had picked up,"" he said. Last year, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs launched a nationwide campaign to return ""vagrant"" children to their homes. Once sent back, the children would be placed in government-run shelters, according to Xinhua. ""Street orphans should be placed in the care of welfare institutions or foster families if their guardians cannot be found,"" the article said, quoting the vice minister of civil affairs. Despite efforts to pull millions out of poverty in China over recent decades, the country still lacks modern child welfare systems seen in the West, Rutstein said. ""The concept of social workers, for instance, which is quite well known in Europe and North America, is very, very new in China. China's aware of this and there are many efforts in place right now to professionalize the whole system of social workers, to introduce alternatives to institutionalization, or just sending children to a state orphanage, which traditionally has been the main response to these kinds of situations,"" he said. An opinion piece published Wednesday in China Daily asked whether authorities were too quick to lay the blame on local officials and suggested that major changes were needed to reduce the number of ""left behind children."" ""This tragedy is a wake-up call that something needs to be done to improve the working and living conditions of migrant workers, so they can settle in the cities where they work and enjoy the same rights as their urban counterparts. This would enable them to have their children live with them,"" it said. The plight of the dead children in Guizhou has been compared on social media to the tale of the Little Match Girl, a Hans Christian Anderson story of a girl ignored by the rich who froze to death after trying to warm herself with a lit match. On Wednesday, messages of condolences for the five boys were still being posted on Weibo. ""Hope they won't feel cold anymore in heaven,"" @Qingyu_aneya said. @KongXia added: ""Rest in peace, don't reincarnate in China..."" Referring to Beijing's decision to turn on the city's heating system two weeks early this year due to colder temperatures, one of China's most popular fairy tale writers, Zheng Yuanjie, posted: ""Beijing spent 800 million [yuan] to start the heating system 15 days ahead of time, but you're out of the reach. Hope the 'The Little Match Boys' can forgive us in heaven."" The boys were Tao Zhongjing, 12; Tao Zhonghong, 11; Tao Zhonglin, 13; Tao Chong, 12; and Tao Bo, 9.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Jaime Escalante was ahead of his time. And today, more than 30 years after the Bolivian-born math teacher put East Los Angeles' Garfield High School on the map by convening 14 students in his very first AP calculus class, the rest of the educational establishment is still trying to catch up. Escalante -- who was immortalized in the 1988 film ""Stand and Deliver"" -- died this week at his son's home in Roseville, California, after a bout with cancer. It was way back in 1978 when Escalante began teaching calculus to Mexican-American kids from the barrio. That's more than two decades before President George W. Bush challenged the nation's public schools to acknowledge and overcome the ""soft bigotry of low expectations,"" and Escalante was already fighting that battle. He knew all about low expectations -- most of them coming from jealous colleagues and visionless administrators. More important, Escalante knew the recipe for how to overcome those low expectations and teach students to succeed. It starts, he would say, with ""ganas"" -- the desire of students to learn, coupled with the desire of teachers to teach. Mix in two parts hard work, a cup of sacrifice, and a dash of ""anything is possible."" Oh, because you'll inevitability meet up with cynics and critics who try to derail you, to make themselves feel better about their own failings and to sustain their prejudices about who can learn and who can't, it doesn't hurt to put in a spoonful of attitude of the sort embodied in Evita Peron's quip: ""It doesn't matter what the morons say."" All across the United States, students and teachers come to the classroom with tons of built-in excuses of why they can't or won't do what they know they need to do. And so, it's no wonder so little gets done. Just as it's no wonder that those who try to break through that culture and actually teach students who have been written off often meet with resistance. One of the things I remember from the years I spent  teaching the children of Mexican farm workers in central California was that sometimes, it seems, students and teachers are competing to see which group is the most victimized. Escalante had no interest in that game. Personally, I think it was because he was an immigrant. Here you have someone who arrived in the United States with very little money, who wasn't able to speak the language, but went on to mop floors and work as a short-order cook by day. He learned English and earned math degrees, and a teaching credential by night, on his way to working for an electronics company. Then he followed his passion into teaching. You know people like that, or you did. Think Grandpa. Think Grandma. Take out ""Bolivia"" and fill in ""Italy"" or ""Ireland."" Those people don't want to hear your problems and why you think you can't do something. It's embarrassing. You whine about how hard you have it and how the odds are against you, and they just arrived from a place that makes your troubles look like a day at the beach. That's how it was for the man who was eulogized this week by Jay Matthews, education reporter for the Washington Post, as ""the most famous and influential American public school teacher of his generation."" Escalante had no interest in hearing why poor Mexican-American kids from a barrio high school couldn't learn calculus, ace a national test and go on to attend prestigious universities. He was too busy making it happen. I met Escalante once in the late 1980's at a black-tie affair in Washington. But, the more memorable encounter took place a couple of years earlier, while I was in college. I had placed a long distance call to Garfield High School and left a message. A student group on campus wanted him to speak. To my surprise, after seeing a message that the school receptionist had scribbled down as being from simply ""Ruben at Harvard,"" he called me back. To my amusement, I soon realized the reason he did was because he thought I was another Ruben at Harvard -- a former student. For a lot of public school teachers in America, especially those who teach socio-economically disadvantaged kids, that kind of call might be unusual. Not Escalante. His former students from Garfield were sprinkled all over the Ivy League -- not just at Harvard, but also at Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Cornell and other universities. I'd sometimes meet them at student conferences, and there was always something special about them and how they carried themselves. There was that badge of honor, that additional bit of confidence that came from being one of an elite group of high achievers who demolished the low expectations of others. These were Jaime's kids. That's an impressive legacy -- and, in the case of an extraordinary educator who still teaches us what's possible in our public schools when you ditch the excuses, and have the ganas to make it happen, a well-deserved one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","America's schools still have a lot to learn from Jaime Escalante, who died this week .

"(CNN)  -- The images of Haitian children crying or injured or wandering the streets alone are heartbreaking. It's no surprise there has been a flood of well-intentioned people who want to adopt those children. But that's not always the best immediate move, aid groups caution. Save the Children Chief Executive Jasmine Whitbread said the ""vast majority"" of children on their own in Haiti are not orphans, but were simply separated from their families in the chaos. Their family members may still be alive, she said, and ""will be desperate to be reunited with them."" ""Taking children out of the country would permanently separate thousands of children from their families -- a separation that would compound the acute trauma they are already suffering and inflict long-term damage on their chances of recovery,"" Whitbread said. Hurriedly whisking unclassified children out of Haiti will not ensure the children are happy or safe in the long-term, experts said. Homes and potential parents must be reviewed by professional social workers and it's logistically impossible to do that in a short time. Allowing adoptions to proceed without thorough background checks can lead to child trafficking and other crimes. The United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, does not facilitate adoptions, but it has been bombarded with calls from people who want a Haitian orphan, said Christopher de Bono, a UNICEF spokesman. In 2007, UNICEF estimated that there were 380,000 orphans in Haiti, but de Bono said Thursday that he'd ""hate to vouch for that figure"" because that number -- any number -- is impossible to verify. Between Haiti's ""lousy [child welfare] oversight system,"" and all the challenges that Haitians have endured, it's not uncommon for Haitian parents to put their children in orphanages temporarily, de Bono said. This means knowing who is truly an orphan and who isn't requires great attention to detail and documents. ""Removing children who've just experienced a disaster from their environment, from where they're from is not necessarily good for them,"" he said. Haitian children must first be fed, sheltered, clothed and given medical attention; the next step is to register them and trace their relatives. Diana Boni, who works with Port-au-Prince's BRESMA orphanage, is firmly against new adoptions out of Haiti. ""Under no circumstances should we evacuate any child newly orphaned or displaced,"" she wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""Imagine losing much of your family, only to discover that a surviving relative had been whisked off to the States to be adopted by strangers without your knowledge or consent! Adoptions without consent are child trafficking. Pure and simple."" Full coverage | Latest news updates | Twitter updates . She has been taking care of children who waited for years in the orphanage to be adopted. ""It's a bit sad, as I have several wonderful children who waited literally for years for new families, and no one ever came,"" she said. The disaster in Haiti has led to an outpouring of support around the world, with the United States alone donating more than $305 million as of Wednesday, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, a newspaper covering nonprofit organizations. List of missing, found | Are you there? | Impact Your World . Because Haiti's poverty already made it ""extremely vulnerable"" to exploitation and abuse, rushed adoptions could open the door to traffickers, said World Vision Chief Executive Justin Byworth. ""We are concerned not only about premature overseas adoption but also about children increasingly being sent unaccompanied to the Dominican Republic,"" he said. Aid groups said adoptions that were already in progress before the January 12 earthquake should go ahead, as long as the right legal documents are in place and they meet Haitian and international law. For those who want to help Haitian children, Whitbread said, they should donate to aid agencies that are working on reuniting children with their families. The International Committee of the Red Cross has opened an office at the headquarters of the Haitian Red Cross in Crois de Prez to help people locate their relatives, said Pete Garratt, a disaster response manager at the British Red Cross. The Red Cross also has set up a Web site to help people searching for relatives, he said. CNN's Jessica Ravitz contributed to this report.","Experts: Hurried adoptions can lead to trafficking and cause more trauma to children .

"(CNN) -- World No.1 Novak Djokovic ended up on the losing side in the Hopman Cup final Saturday just 24 hours after it was announced that the ATP 250 tournament he owned back in his native Serbia had folded. Djokovic and former World No.1 Ana Ivanovic were beaten in the deciding mixed doubles 6-4 7-5 by Fernando Verdasco and Anna Medina Garrigues as Spain won the final 2-1 to claim the trophy at the mixed team event in Perth. Djokovic beat Verdasco in the opening rubber 6-3 7-5 but Ivanovic suffered a surprise 6-4 6-7 6-2 defeat to veteran baseliner Garrigues in their singles tussle as Spain drew level. Djokovic's family has run the Serbia Open tournament, which was scheduled to take place from April 29 to May 5 in Belgrade, since 2009. Staged on an outdoor clay court, it acted as a warm-up event for the French Open and was the first ATP tournament to be held in the country.. He had won the title twice, most recently in 2011, while Italy's Andreas Seppi claimed the crown in 2012 in what has turned out to be its last staging. Djokovic had opted not to play in his own event, dramatically reducing its appeal. A statement by Djokovic's Family Sport company, the tournament organizers, was posted on the official ATP Tour website to confirm the decision, but without giving any reasons. ""We have made the most rational decision considering the circumstances. We are grateful for everyone's contribution and help in running this event that brought a lot of international stars and attention to Serbia,"" it read. ""Unfortunately, we will not be able to run the Belgrade tournament and we have decided to cease the tournament's operations from 2013."" Djokovic has suffered mixed fortunes since arriving in Australia for the defense of the title at the opening grand slam of the season later this month. Jetlagged on his arrival from Abu Dhabi, he suffered a scare when a crowd barrier collapsed on him during his opening match, a straight sets win over Seppi. He was also beaten by Bernard Tomic in his singles rubber in the match against hosts Australia, but against Verdasco in the final he showed the form which has kept him at the top of the world rankings for the past two seasons. He then had to watch Ivanovic lose a two-hour 38 minute tussle with Garrigues before they were second best in the doubles. Last year, the Serbian duo reached the final, but an abdominal injury to Ivanovic ended their chances. ""We were unfortunate last time, this time we were beaten by a better team,"" Djokovic said after their defeat.","Novak Djokovic's Serbia beaten by Spain in Hopman Cup final .

"(CNN) -- The stars of tennis took time out from their French Open preparations Sunday to honor the man who helped them become some of the highest-paid athletes in the world. Brad Drewett passed away Friday, aged 54, succumbing to the motor neurone disease that had forced him to step down as head of the men's ATP World Tour. Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Serena Williams led a minute's silence ahead of the start of the Madrid Masters, while similar tributes were held at tournaments in Portugal and Germany. ""Brad wasn't just the president of the ATP but was a player himself, a board member,"" Federer said on the ATP website. ""He's given so much time and effort to the ATP, and I think this is really what we will try to honor in a small way today."" Drewett reached a career-high 34 in the world rankings, but his efforts in administration had far bigger impact on the game, from his time on the players' council to running the ATP's Middle East, Asia and Pacific operations before becoming president in early 2012. The Australian took the end-of-season championship to China as part of tennis' global spread in the early 2000s, and then brought it to London where it has become a lucrative moneyspinner and showpiece for the ATP. He has also been credited with getting the players a larger share of prize money from the four grand slam tournaments since he took over the top role a year and half ago. ""He was always very nice to work with. Very honest. Very nice. Gentle,"" said 17-time grand slam winner Federer. ""I've really enjoyed every step of the way working with him. For me, it was hard seeing him not be the same anymore towards the end physically. But we can only appreciate what he's done for us and what he did until the last moment he really possibly could. ""That will never go away. I'm sure that the ATP and the players will come up with something for the legacy of Brad Drewett. It's very important."" Nadal said Drewett was ""a very loved person"" on the circuit. ""The only thing we can do is say thank you for everything he has done for our sport, all the support, and all the good things he has done these years to help us and to help us to have a better sport. It's a sad moment for all of us."" World No. 2 Federer is returning to action this week to defend his Madrid title, having recovered from the back injury that hampered him at Indian Wells in March. Like Nadal, he is happy that the Spanish event has reverted to traditional red clay after experimenting with a blue surface last year that was roundly condemned by many players and subsequently banned by the ATP. ""There was a lot of criticism about the color, about the quality of the court as well, being extremely slippery,"" he told reporters. ""I don't know if that was due to the color, but this tournament has in the past had issues with the quality of the court. I think through what happened last year with the controversy around the blue clay, it was a big eye opener to have a proper court here now. ""I think this year, from what I'm hearing from the players, it's a good quality court and the players are happy. In the process, hopefully we'll see better tennis this year."" Top-ranked Djokovic, who ended Nadal's eight-year reign in Monte Carlo last month, is also happier with the new surface. ""The court is great. The one where I practiced is great. I haven't practiced on the center court yet, but I'll try to do that tonight to get a little feel about it,"" the Serbian said. Nadal bounced back from his Monte Carlo final defeat to win the Barcelona Open title for the eighth time in nine years. ""The courts were not at the level to play professionally last year,"" he told reporters. ""Fortunately this year they are very good. In Madrid, we have the problem of the dry climate, so it's very difficult to have the clay that settles down properly."" The women's tournament is also packed with top names, as defending champion Williams seeks to protect her No. 1 ranking from the challenge of in-form Maria Sharapova -- who will go top if she wins the title. Williams made a slow start to her opening match against Kazakh qualifier Yulia Putintseva on Sunday before winning 7-6 (7-5) 6-1. However, her older sister Venus was forced to withdraw ahead of her match against Spain's Anabel Medina Garrigues due to a back injury. Chinese fifth seed Li Na crashed out, losing 6-3 6-2 to 18-year-old American Madison Keys. Former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki continued her decline, as the Danish 10th seed lost 6-2 6-4 to another Kazakh player, Yaroslava Shvedova. Czech eighth seed Petra Kvitova, the 2011 Madrid champion, went through to round two along with Poland's world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska. Meanwhile, veteran Tommy Haas won the Munich Open on Sunday, beating fellow German Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3 7-6 (7-3) 13 years after losing in his previous final appearance in the clay event. The 35-year-old, a former world No. 2, will now climb to 13th in the rankings. It was the first all-German final in Munich since 1965, and Kohlschreiber was unable to defend his title -- having also won it in 2007. In Oeiras, Stanislas Wawrinka upset top seed and world No. 4 David Ferrer 6-1 6-4 to win the Portugal Open on Sunday. It was the 28-year-old Swiss' fourth career title, and first since January 2011.","Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal among stars to pay tribute to Brad Drewett .

"(CNN) -- The gulf between smartphones and cameras is getting smaller, thanks to a new point-and-shoot camera from Nikon that's powered by the Android operating system. The 16-megapixel Coolpix S800c camera, announced Wednesday, will be the first camera running Android on the market when it hits shelves in September. The addition of Android brings a few much-needed features to the point-and-shoot. Users can download mobile apps from the Google Play store and share images over cellular networks by tethering to a nearby smartphone or tablet. Pinterest releases new iPad and Android apps . When phone makers first started adding tiny, low-resolution cameras to their devices, the camera industry was not terribly threatened. They had glorious digital SLR cameras with interchangeable lenses, sleek pocket cameras with large sensors and manual controls, and features like high-ISO for low-light shooting, megazoom, and rugged bodies for the outdoors. Anyone who loved photos would certainly prefer the high-quality shots captured on ""real"" cameras, right? But the camera companies underestimated just how important convenience was to consumers, and the public's appetite for sharing photos of moments right when they happened. The resulting cellphone images were low-quality, but nothing a little sepia-filter couldn't fix. The iPhone was not the first phone to have a camera, but it made sharing images online, over its cellular connection, a snap. In 2011, more than a quarter of photos and videos were captured using a smartphone, according to a study from research company NPD Group. That number is only getting larger. The $350 Coolpix S800c is bringing some of what has made those smartphones so popular to a camera. It doesn't have a cellular connection, but it does have Wi-Fi. Wireless connections have been around for a while on cameras, but the addition of Android means the camera can tether to a smartphone or tablet running Android when there's no Wi-Fi network handy. The 3.5-inch touchscreen display gives users access to the Google Play store, where photogs can go to download more apps for their camera, including editing tools and social networks, such as Twitter, Facebook and, of course, Instagram. The camera can also run all the regular smartphone apps, allowing users to send e-mail, browse the Internet, listen to music and play games. Like Apple's iPod Touch, it draws the line at making phone calls, however. The camera has 10X zoom, can shoot 1080p video, and includes GPS and maps for tagging images with locations. There are no manual controls. The S800c is running Android 2.3, known as Gingerbread, which is not the most recent version of the operating system. That Nikon is the first to bring an Android camera to market is a surprise, since competitors Sony and Samsung already make Android devices and were in a better position to combine the two products. Polaroid showed off a demo camera running Android at the Consumer Electronics show in January, the SC1630, but it isn't yet available. Nikon's Android camera may be a first in the camera industry, but it's still playing catch-up to the real competitors: smartphones with increasingly higher-quality cameras.","Nikon's new point-and-shoot camera is powered by the Android operating system .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's equivalent to the U.S. National Security Agency, the Government Communications Headquarters, has tapped into many of the world's key international fiber optic cables and is routinely downloading and analyzing vast quantities of Internet and phone traffic, sharing the data with the NSA, The Guardian newspaper reported Friday. The NSA slammed the report as ""absolutely false."" ""Any allegation that NSA relies on its foreign partners to circumvent U.S. law is absolutely false. NSA does not ask its foreign partners to undertake any intelligence activity that the U.S. government would be legally prohibited from undertaking itself,"" NSA spokeswoman Judith Emmel said. The scope of the surveillance dragnet described in the article is enormous. The newspaper says the report, like many previous ones, is based on the Guardian's reading of documents provided by former U.S. defense contractor Edward Snowden, who admitted leaking documents this month detailing government surveillance programs.

"(CNN) -- A computer glitch forced Southwest Airlines to ground 250 flights, the company said early Saturday. Flights already in the air were not affected by the glitch, which started late Friday night. Most flights resumed takeoff early Saturday after the airline resorted to a backup system. ""Flights have started to depart, but employees are working through a manual process so their routine work flow is taking a bit longer,"" said Michelle Agnew, a spokeswoman for the airline. ""The manual process is involved because the team doesn't have access to all of the normal tools they would use to be able to communicate and dispatch flights."" Agnew said the glitch was in the internal system used to dispatch flights. It mostly affected planes on the ground that were scheduled to depart, she said. All Southwest flights were affected, but because the glitch occurred late, most of the planes waiting to fly were limited to the West Coast, she said. Major Southwest hubs in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Oakland, California, had grounded their flights. Southwest has an estimated 3,400 flights daily.","Flights already in the air were not affected by the breakdown .

"(The Frisky) -- It seems that all anyone is talking about lately is the economy, so why is money still such a tough topic to discuss with your nearest and dearest? They say married couples fight over money more than anything else, but what about when you just started dating? That's possibly even more awkward. Columnist says no woman should leave her house on first date without enough money to pay for her meal. The first date . Though Dr. Phil feels otherwise, my take on this has always been he (or she) who asks, pays. (The bloviating shrink says men should always be the ones to pony up.) And if you don't pay for the whole thing, you should at least offer to split the tab. Incredibly (to me), most women I spoke to thought I was an idiot and firmly believed the dude should always pay on a first date -- though for some this was a recent change of heart. Kate, a 33-year-old writer told me, ""I tend to try to pay for myself, but as I get older and more comfortable with my awesomeness, I kind of wish and hope that the other person will be a little more old-fashioned about it."" Good point. If someone's eating opposite Amazing Me, shouldn't she or he pay for the privilege? After all, I'm entertaining and cute and if you let me order dessert there may be some smooching in your future. Regardless of your feelings on the matter, whatever you do, don't leave the house without enough money to pay for at least your share. It's a first date so while he may seem great (and generous) on paper, you never really know what you're getting into until he's sitting across from you. Sure, he might be staring adoringly deep into your eyes, but then again, his pants might be held up with duct tape. Do you really want to count on that dude to know the meaning of ""gratuity?"" What to say: ""That's so generous of you -- can I at least leave the tip?"" What not to say: ""This princess doesn't pay for food!"" Dates two-thru-six . Jennifer Kelton, CEO and founder of BadOnlineDates.com, has built a business on bad dating behavior. She explains her thoughts on the money issue: ""While it's not expected, Let's face it -- we are hardwired to want the man to 'bring back dinner to the cave.'"" Up until my current relationship, I've almost always been in the driver's seat finance-wise (and believe me, that's a pretty meager seat) so I've always furnished my own cave. I ask her if it's okay to date a guy just for a free ride or free grub? Kelton says no. ""Being cheap is never attractive and I would say that after more than four dates the woman should pay the tip."" Whoa! Just the tip? Apparently the women who called me a moron were onto something! However, if you're going to keep riding the free-food express, the least you can do is surreptitiously feel out his money situation -- if he's hurting, suggest cheaper restaurants or maybe cook for the guy. What to say: ""That's so generous of you -- can I at least leave the tip?"" What not to say: ""Let's have the 2000 Perrier-Jouet, since this one's on you!"" Dates six-thru-infinity . Up until the two of you really get to know each other, there's probably not going to be any urgent need to discuss finances in depth, but he can't keep buying you steak and foie gras dinners if he's on a cheeseburger and fries budget. For all you know, you're out-earning him or he's supporting 12 Guatemalan orphans and is stretched to the breaking point. Then again, maybe he's a gazillionaire. At about date six (possibly sooner if they're really eventful dates!), you should be getting to know a lot about every part of him -- including his wallet. There's no right or wrong way to approach this discussion, but just remember, financial compatibility is almost as important as sexual chemistry, though rarely as much fun.

"(CNN) -- Brazil has intensified its efforts to forge closer relations with Africa recently, as the sixth largest economy in the world tries to compete with other emerging giants like China and India to take a more central role in the resource-rich continent. Last month, Brazil's top investment bank BTG Pactual unveiled plans to raise $1 billion to create the world's biggest investment fund for Africa, focusing on areas such as infrastructure, energy and agriculture. The independent bank's fund, which comes amid a government drive to establish a strategic partnership with Africa, is one of the latest moves signaling Brazil's increasing interest to extend its economic footprint on the continent -- trade between Brazil and Africa jumped from around $4 billion in 2000 to about $20 billion in 2010. ""It does represent a turning point where a lot of these investors and these entities for investments are recognizing that Africa is indeed the last frontier for growth,"" says Lyal White, director of the Centre for Dynamic Markets at the Gordon Institute for Business Science in South Africa. Eyeing potential . An unprecedented decade of economic growth in Africa, coupled with a series of policy and institutional reforms, has attracted emerging global powers into the continent, seeking to gain a stronger foothold in the continent in their bid to reach more markets and forge new political alliances. Read more: Why Asian giants scent opportunity in Africa . But while much has been said and written about China's and India's strides in Africa, Brazil's African foray has garnered less attention. ""Brazil has kind of been operating under the radar, it is not seen necessarily as one of those kind of players [China and India],"" says Markus Weimer, research fellow in the Africa Program at Chatham House. ""The stories of Brazil with Africa have also been less contentious -- you've heard stories from Zambia about miners being mistreated by their Chinese bosses but you don't hear from Mozambique or Angola when it comes to Brazilian companies."" Using Portuguese-speaking countries like Angola and Mozambique as an entry point to the continent, Brazil's state and private companies have made big inroads in various parts the continent, operating mostly in strategic sectors such as infrastructure, mining and energy -- last year, mining giant Vale announced plans to spend more than Â£12 billion on investments in Africa over the next five years. But while Brazil, like China, seems to be deeply engaged with the African resource sector, some analysts say its strategy and interests are quite distinct from its resource-hungry BRICS partner. ""Being a resource-rich country and a future major oil exporter itself, Brazil is not pursuing a strategy to secure resources,"" says Christina Stolte, research at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies. ""Rather, the South American economy is seeing Africa as a means of diversifying its export markets -- for food, seeds, agricultural machinery -- and internationalizing the production of its big companies -- Petrobras in the oil and biofuels business, Vale in the mining business."" Strong ties . Although separated by the Atlantic Ocean, Brazil and Africa have long historical and cultural ties, dating back to the days of slave trade in the 16th century, where scores of Africans where shipped to the former Portuguese colony to be exploited as slaves on the sugar cane plantations. Today, Brazil is quick to use this cultural affinity with Africa as an advantage in its competition with the other powers acting on the continent, analysts say. ""The fact that the majority of Brazil's population is of Afro-Brazilian origin -- making Brazil the world's largest black population after Nigeria -- is frequently quoted by the, almost exclusively white, governing elite of Brazil in order to stress Brazil's cultural similarities with the African countries,"" says Stolte. Read more: Is the West losing out to China in Africa? Such remarks could often be heard during the 2003-2010 presidency of Lula da Silva, who made Africa a strategic priority for Brazil as part of the country's efforts to expand its global influence. During his eight-year tenure, Lula made 12 trips to Africa, visiting 21 countries, more than any of his predecessors. At the same time, Brazil increased the number of its embassies in Africa from 17 in 2002 to 37, boasting today more embassies in the continent than the United Kingdom. Brazil's deepening engagement with Africa has also continued under the leadership of Dilma Rousseff, who became president of Brazil in January 2011 -- in her first year in office, Rousseff visited Angola, Mozambique, and South Africa. Business model . Analysts say Brazil has adopted a three-pronged approach to its engagement with Africa, with an ""almost seamless interaction"" between the government, the private sector and development institutions. ""This all kind of comes together as one coherent strategy toward Africa from Brazil,"" says White. Brazilian companies seeking to do business in the continent tend to hire and train local workforce and offer social projects to foster home-grown development -- in Angola, Brazilian construction company Odebrecht has become the largest private employer in the country. Knowledge transfer . In recent decades, Brazil has gone from being a net importer of food to one of the world's biggest exporters of agricultural and food products. More recently, Brazil's per capita income rose an average of 1.8% faster than its GDP in 2003-09, according to a World Bank report. As a result, Brazil's domestic development experience and success in narrowing social inequality have attracted attention from several African countries who are keen to replicate some of its programs. Analysts say Brazil is keen to leverage its advanced technological know-how in helping African countries in areas that are key to the continent's development, including tropical agriculture and disease fighting. ""Brazil therefore sees itself as partner for African countries that is able to offer successful strategies to fight the continent's most pending problems such as hunger and AIDS,"" says Stolte.","Brazil seeks to establish partnership with Africa .
Analysts say Brazil sees Africa as a means of diversifying its export markets .
It also wants to internationalize the production of its big companies .

"(CNN) -- Huawei has given up its quest to conquer the market for telecom network equipment in the US, where the Chinese company's sales efforts have been repeatedly blocked by security fears. ""We are not interested in the US market any more,"" Eric Xu, executive vice-president, said at the company's annual analyst summit on Tuesday. The world's second-largest supplier of network gear by revenue has shifted the focus of expansion away from the US over the past year. Huawei's decision ends an aggressive push for business in the world's largest economy. US security officials and politicians have repeatedly identified Huawei as a threat to US national security -- an allegation the Chinese company has consistently denied. Although Huawei has done business with 45 of the world's top carriers, it failed to get contracts from any leading operators in the US. Last month, Sprint Nextel, the third largest US mobile network operator, and its Japanese suitor, Softbank, both gave assurances to the House intelligence committee that they would not use Huawei equipment. In October, a US congressional report officially branded Huawei and ZTE, its smaller Chinese peer, a threat to national security. At the time, Representative Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called on the US government and private sector companies to shun Huawei and ZTE. Despite its success in other markets, including the UK, Huawei has struggled in the US for years because of concerns among politicians and security officials about the military background of its founder Ren Zhengfei, a former People's Liberation Army officer. In 2008, Huawei retracted a bid for 3Com, a US technology company, after it emerged that the proposed deal would not gain regulatory approval in Washington. Two years later, Huawei bid for a multibillion-dollar contract to supply network infrastructure to Sprint Nextel, one of the top US operators, but lost after the US government intervened. It also failed to win bids for other US telecom assets and, in 2011, was forced to unwind a $2m deal to buy patents from a US company. In response to these setbacks, Huawei launched a major US lobbying campaign. It hired a number of senior executives from ailing rivals such as Nortel and Motorola, in an effort to build a big research and development presence. Ken Hu, a senior Huawei executive, also wrote a passionate open letter calling on the US government to launch a formal investigation, which he believed would clear his company. But October's congressional report made it even more difficult for the company to do business in the US, Huawei executives say. As a result, it has halted its expansion there. While Huawei still employs 1,400 people in the US, its R&D headcount has dropped from 800 to 500, and the sales team has shrunk too. Executives at the company's consumer and enterprise business-groups said they no longer consider the US to be a strategic market. Huawei on Tuesday also revised downwards the long-term outlook for its enterprise business, its youngest but fastest-growing division. William Xu, the unit's chief executive, said its goal of generating $15bn in revenues from the business by 2017 -- a target set just last year -- was ""too optimistic"". The company is now aiming for just US$10bn. But Mr Xu still expects the unit's revenues to grow 45 per cent this year, up from 25 per cent growth in 2012.","China's Huawei has ended attempts to gain access to U.S. telecoms gear market .

"(CNN) -- Wealthy socialite and Grammy-nominated songwriter Denise Rich has renounced her U.S. citizenship and resides in London, her spokeswoman Judy Smith said Tuesday. Rich's maiden name, Eisenberg, appeared on April 30 in the Federal Registrar's Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen To Expatriate, though she left in November 2011. By handing in her American passport, tax lawyers say she is able to legally avoid paying significant taxes on her estate. Rich, 68, is the ex-wife of billionaire commodities trader Marc Rich, who was pardoned in 2001 by then-president Bill Clinton for oil profiteering and tax evasion after he fled to Switzerland. The pardon was considered controversial because of Denise Rich's financial contributions to the Democratic Party and to the Clinton Library. As of 2001, Denise Rich had made more than $1.3 million in political contributions to the Democratic Party since 1993, including $70,000 to Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign and $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library in Arkansas. Investigators told CNN at the time that there were Secret Service logs showing that Rich went to the White House the last night of Bill Clinton's presidency. Superman renounces his American citizenship . Rich isn't the only high-profile American to abandon ship. Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin also appears on this list. He renounced his citizenship in May shortly before Facebook's initial public offering. They are two of many who have expatriated from the United States in the last few years. ""It may not be coincidental that some of these high profile expatriations are occurring when asset values have been relatively depressed,"" said tax attorney Dean Berry of Cadwalader, Wickersham, & Taft LLP. But Rich is not completely off the tax hook. According to expatriation tax legislation passed in June 2008, she is considered a covered expatriate and will therefore have to pay an exit tax on the net gain calculations of her assets. It is still far less than she would have paid as a U.S. citizen with a large estate, however, according to tax attorneys. ""Expatriation makes the most sense when asset values are historically low and tax rates are historically low. Her timing may have had something to do with that,"" tax attorney David S. Miller of Cadwalader, Wickersham, & Taft LLP said. In January, Rich put her Fifth Avenue Manhattan penthouse on the market, according to her real estate agency, Corcoran. The property, which boasts 20 rooms and 11 baths, is on sale for $65 million. According to her spokeswoman, Rich renounced her citizenship because she wanted to live in London, where her long-time partner and her two daughters live. Rich, a songwriter, has been nominated for Grammys three times. She has written for Patti LaBelle, Chaka Khan and Marc Anthony, among others. In 1999, Rich was nominated for a Grammy for the duet she penned for Mary J. Blige and Aretha Franklin, titled ""Don't Waste Your Time.""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- More than one in three women have experienced sexual assault, physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey. The same is true for more than one in four men, according to the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. The survey, released Wednesday, was based on telephone interviews with more than 16,500 adults in 2010. Supported by the National Institute of Justice and the Department of Defense, the survey was aimed at better describing and monitoring ""the magnitude of sexual violence, stalking and intimate partner violence victimization in the United States,"" the CDC said. The report is the first of its kind to provide data on national and state levels, the agency said. The data can assist in understanding the burden of violence in populations and address some of the health issues that may accompany it. Those may include depression, anxiety, low self-esteem and suicide attempts, but also conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders, substance abuse, sexually transmitted diseases and gynecological or pregnancy complications. ""The health problems caused by violence remind us of the importance of prevention,"" said Howard Spivak, director of the CDC's Injury Center Division of Violence Prevention, in a statement. ""In addition to intervening and providing services, prevention efforts need to start earlier in life, with the ultimate goal of preventing all of these types of violence before they start."" Among the victims of intimate partner violence, more than one in three women reported experiencing multiple forms of rape, stalking or physical violence. Among males, 92% reported experiencing physical violence from a partner, while 6% said they experienced both physical violence and stalking. However, nearly half of all women and men reported experiencing ""psychological aggression"" from an intimate partner. Nearly one in four women and one in seven men said they had been subjected to ""severe physical violence"" by an intimate partner -- defined in the report as being hit with a fist or hard object, beaten or slammed against something. Of the victims of intimate partner violence, nearly three in 10 women and one-tenth of men reported effects of the violence -- fear; concern for their safety; symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder; needing medical treatment or suffering an injury; contacting a crisis hotline; needing housing, victim advocate or legal services or missing at least one day of work or school. As far as sexual violence, nearly one in five women -- translating to nearly 22 million women in the United States -- reported having been raped or the target of an attempted rape during their lifetime, according to the survey. More than half of them, 51%, said they were raped by an intimate partner and nearly 41% by an acquaintance. Of the victims of completed rapes, nearly 80% said they experienced their first rape before the age of 25 and 42% before the age of 18. About one in five white and African-American women and one in seven Hispanic women reported being raped at some point. One in 71 men also reported being raped during their lifetime; of those, more than one-fourth, or nearly 28%, experienced their first rape when they were 10 or younger. More than half the men, or 52%, said they were raped by an acquaintance. Linda Degutis, director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the CDC, said the organization was very concerned by how large the numbers were, and by how great an impact such abuse has on people's lives. Highlighting the extent of the issue may help people to feel more comfortable reporting abuse when it occurs, she said, and aid them in forming healthy relationships. ""The solution is the same for both sexes, to develop relationships that are strong, that are stable and do not allow violence to be a part of the relationship or of resolving conflict in a relationship,"" Degutis said. The report confirms ""that sexual violence is one of the most pervasive and serious public health issues in the country,"" said Laura Palumbo, prevention campaign specialist at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. ""We've been well aware of the kind of far-reaching effects of sexual violence and the frequency of it, but it's really helpful to have a current and widespread set of data that can confirm that for us. It's not news to people that have been doing this work, but it is really wonderful that we have now something really concrete that we can point to."" The information can ""be used to spearhead prevention efforts,"" especially if it will be updated annually and trends over time can be tracked, she said. Palumbo applauded the report's focus on male victims of sexual assault. ""For a number of reasons in our society, it's really difficult to believe that this happens to men,"" she said. ""It's difficult for a man to be able to say that this has happened to him because our culture doesn't accept male vulnerability. Our culture really puts a lot of pressure on men to be able to protect themselves."" While recent child sex abuse scandals at Penn State University and in the Catholic Church have helped focus attention on child sex abuse, she said, male sexual assault ""is consistently happening, and it's not focused on in the way that it needs to be."" Victimization by stalking was reported by one in six women and one in 19 men, to the point where ""they felt very fearful or believed that they or someone close to them would be harmed or killed,"" the survey report said. Two-thirds of women reported their stalker was an intimate partner, while 80% of men said the stalker was an intimate partner or acquaintance. The most common form of stalking reported was repeatedly receiving unwanted telephone calls along with voice or text messages. The estimates for sexual violence, stalking and intimate partner violence are ""alarmingly high"" for adult Americans, with intimate partner violence alone affecting more than 12 million people yearly, the CDC said. ""Women are disproportionately impacted. They experienced high rates of severe intimate partner violence, rape and stalking and long-term chronic disease and other health impacts, such as PTSD symptoms."" The study points to long-term health effects, ""everything from irritable bowel syndrome to diabetes, things that will really have an influence on the quality and length of someone's life,"" said Palumbo. ""... In many ways, there's a domino effect"" of complications and needs after a traumatic experience, she added. Such victims need coordinated services to ensure healing and prevent a recurrence, the report said, including strengthening the response of the health care system. ""One way to strengthen the response to survivors is through increased training of healthcare professionals,"" the CDC said. ""It is also critically important to ensure that legal, housing, mental health and other services and resources are available and accessible to survivors."" Holding perpetrators accountable is also a key issue, according to the survey, which noted that survivors of sexual violence, stalking or intimate partner violence may be reluctant to report the behavior because of shame, embarrassment, fear of retribution or a belief that authorities may not support them. Prevention efforts should also focus on families, particularly on fostering healthy relationships between parents and children and emotionally supportive environments, the survey said. ""These environments provide a strong foundation for children,"" the survey said. ""... It is equally important to continue addressing the beliefs, attitudes and messages that are deeply embedded in our social structures and that create a climate that condones sexual violence, stalking and intimate partner violence.""","NEW: Highlighting the issue may help people form healthy relationships, an expert says .

"(CNN) -- A Drug Enforcement Administration agent was killed in an apparent robbery attempt in Colombia, the agency announced Friday. Special Agent James ""Terry"" Watson, assigned to the DEA unit in Cartagena, was on temporary duty in Bogota. Watson died after being stabbed in a taxi cab Thursday night after leaving a Bogota restaurant, a law enforcement official said. Investigators believe Watson's cab stopped at a traffic light and his assailants jumped out of two other cabs which pulled up on either side of the vehicle in which he was riding, the official said. The official said taxi vehicle robberies are part of what are called ""millionaire ride"" thefts. There's no suggestion the suspected robbers knew they had set upon a DEA agent. According to the official, Watson managed to escape from the cab and was taken to a hospital, where he died. Patrick Ventrell, a State Department spokesman, said earlier Thursday evening Watson watched the last game of the NBA finals at a restaurant with colleagues from the U.S. Embassy. The United States is working in close cooperation with Colombian authorities to find those responsible, Ventrell said. ""This is really a profound tragedy for our embassy community and indeed for our government."" ""These are the worst days for anyone in law enforcement and we grieve Terry's loss,"" said DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. The DEA said Watson was a 13-year veteran of the agency. He had been sent to Afghanistan three times on counter-narcotics trafficking assignments and had previously served in the Army and worked for the U.S. Marshals Service.","DEA mourns loss of special agent .

"(CNN)  -- A Nebraska couple missing along with their children since last month surrendered to police and were taken into custody Monday, authorities said in a statement. The Schade family of Creighton, Nebraska, had last been seen on March 20 in Knox County. Matthew and Rowena Schade, along with their children, met with Knox County Sheriff Jim Janecek Monday about 10:50 a.m. according to the written statement from Janecek's office. ""The family turned themselves over to law enforcement officers from the Knox County Sheriff's Office and the Nebraska State Patrol,"" the statement said. ""Matthew Schade was arrested on an Antelope County warrant for violation of probation and Rowena is being held on a detainer from the Nebraska Department of Probation."" A determination on the placement of the children, a daughter, 11, and a son, 8, will be made after interviews with child welfare workers from the state Department of Health and Human Services, the sheriff's statement said. Both Matthew and Rowena Schade were on probation -- he in Antelope County, and she in Pierce County, officials in both counties told CNN. Antelope County Attorney Michael Long told CNN Matthew Schade was wanted for violation of probation and failure to report a change of address. The Schade family was last seen on March 20 in Knox County. Janecek said they disappeared after an officer went to their home on a domestic abuse complaint. Knox County is near the Nebraska-South Dakota border. Authorities in both states on Friday suspended a search for the family after a relative told authorities he had spoken with them and they were unharmed. Authorities thought they might be in Nebraska, after a brush truck they believed the couple stole from a South Dakota volunteer fire department was found abandoned in Antelope County on Friday. A brush truck is a type of small fire truck. Schade's father, Chet Schade, contacted the Knox sheriff's office on Thursday afternoon. He confirmed he had spoken with all four family members and said they were alive and well. Searchers had been searching for the family in South Dakota's Black Hills until it was determined the couple possibly made their way back to Nebraska. Investigators thought the Schades might have gone camping on U.S. Forest Service property in the Black Hills. Schade had visited the area in the past, and law officers found the family's Ford Taurus on Tuesday in Silver City, South Dakota.","Matthew and Rowena Schade, children, met with Knox County Sheriff Monday .

"New York (CNN) -- Sixteen years ago, Sundhe Moses was found guilty of second-degree murder for the death of a 4-year-old girl caught in a gang-related shootout. But the District Attorney's Office in Brooklyn, New York, is now taking a second look at his case after another murder conviction was overturned in March. Moses' conviction review is one of 50 investigations from the District Attorney's Criminal Investigation Unit that was sparked after prosecutors suggested that David Ranta's second-degree murder conviction of a rabbi in 1991 be tossed out. A witness came forward years after the case and said that an investigator coached him into identifying Ranta in a lineup. Ranta, who insisted he was innocent for years, was freed from prison after serving 23 years. The same detective was involved in Moses' investigation. Moses, now 37, said that former New York Police Department Officer Louis Scarcella beat him, wrote the words of a confession he was forced to sign and smudged his signature, according to Ron Kuby, Moses' lawyer. Kuby said there were multiple red flags raised through the trial, despite Moses being found guilty and sentenced to 16Â½ years to life. According to Kuby, none of the six eyewitnesses identified Moses at trial, though two said they identified him earlier in a lineup. Moses also insisted on testifying in court, a rare occurrence often insisted upon by the innocent, Kuby said. Kuby suggests that the high-profile crime of an innocent victim and the public's demand for action led police to inaccurately charge Moses. ""Moses knew many of the people in that area implicated by gang violence,"" Kuby told CNN on Monday. ""It was ... guilt by association.""

"London (CNN) -- ""After the storm of a life lived in the heat of political controversy, there is a great calm."" And so it seemed inside St. Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday as more than 2,300 guests from 170 countries stilled their quiet chatter and waited, silently, for the coffin of Margaret Thatcher to enter. Those words from the Right Rev. Richard Chartres, Bishop of London, in many ways summed up the mood within: This was a farewell to a stateswoman and Britain's pioneering first female prime minister but also to a very human mother and grandmother now gone to her final rest. The domed white marble splendor of St. Paul's, Christopher Wren's masterpiece, only served to remind those within of how insignificant even the greatest of leaders is in the end. Rewriting history: How UK might have been without Thatcher . The coffin's solemn arrival was signaled to those waiting inside by the muffled tone of the cathedral clock tolling the hour. Far from the fierce political debate and fervent protests that raged in Thatcher's life -- and indeed in the nine days since her death -- the coffin was carried quietly in by uniformed members of the armed forces. Draped in a Union flag and topped with a white flower arrangement, it was placed carefully on a bier directly before the guests of honor at the service, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. They sat across the aisle from Thatcher's children, Mark and Carol; and her grandchildren, Michael and Amanda; and next to serving Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife. Thatcher: Revered and reviled, in death as in life . A ceremonial mourning sword lay on a red-covered table before the queen, carried in by the Lord Mayor of London. The royals' red velvet-covered chairs had been the last to be filled, as steadily the cathedral filled to its capacity. Those who'd taken their places in the tight-packed rows of seats behind and to either side included men in formal military uniform, adorned with gold braid and medals, cardinals with their distinctive red caps, women in elaborate black hats and foreign dignitaries, some in dark suits, others in more distinctive traditional dress. Live blog: Funeral of Margaret Thatcher . Grey hair was much in evidence, and men outnumbered women -- as was the case by a much greater margin when Thatcher was in office. After all, when she entered Parliament in 1959, she made up part of only 4% who were women. From time to time during the ceremony, sunlight poured through the windows of the cathedral to glint off the gold mosaic tiles and gilded carvings below the frescoed dome, lit also by gleaming candelabra. There was no sign within the grand cathedral walls of the tight security outside, with crowds of supporters and a few pockets of protesters kept under the watchful gaze of some 4,000 police officers. Welcoming the congregation, the Very Rev. David Ison, dean of St. Paul's -- who himself this week evoked the lasting anger and hurt felt by some in Britain as a result of Thatcher's policies -- recalled now ""her leadership of this nation, her courage, her steadfastness, and her resolve to accomplish what she believed to be right for the common good."" Giving thanks for the country's traditions of freedom, democracy and rule of law, he invited those gathered to pray. Only twice did a quiet murmur of laughter punctuate the solemn calm of the proceedings, when Chartres recounted anecdotes which gave a more personal sense of Thatcher's dealings with those she met. She may not be able to control how she is judged by future generations, but the late prime minister's hand was behind much of the service that marks the end of her physical presence on Earth. Opinion: Why Britain needs another Thatcher . As Chartres pointed out, at her request this was not a memorial service, filled with eulogies, but a simple funeral that reflected her disciplined Methodist upbringing as a grocer's daughter in Grantham. He acknowledged the contentious nature of her legacy, saying, ""the storm of conflicting opinions centers on the Mrs. Thatcher who became a symbolic figure -- even an 'ism,' "" but said that lying there, she was ""one of us,"" subject to human destiny. ""There is an important place for debating policies and legacy; for assessing the everyday lives of individuals and communities ... but here and today is neither the time nor the place,"" he said. ""This is a place for ordinary human compassion of the kind that is reconciling. It is also the place for simple truths which transcend political debate."" Thatcher's granddaughter, Amanda, gave the first reading, her voice clear and steady despite the gravity of the occasion. Its theme of righteous struggle, ""not against flesh and blood but against principalities, against powers, against the ruler of darkness of this world"" was perhaps meant to bring to mind Thatcher's own struggles, first to reach power as a woman in the 1970s and then to exercise it for the good of her country. As the Bishop of London said, ""In a setting like this ... it is easy to forget the immense hurdles she had to climb."" Cameron, who now leads the Conservative Party that Thatcher headed from 1975 to 1990, gave the second short reading from the King James Bible. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, rounded off the service with the final blessing. The hymns and predominantly English music, chosen by Thatcher and her family, reflected the tastes of a woman Cameron described last week as a ""patriot prime minister"" with a ""lion-hearted love"" of her country. And at the end of the funeral, as the other illustrious guests filed out -- including 11 serving prime ministers, 17 serving foreign ministers and senior clergy from around the world, as well as many British lawmakers -- the sense was reinforced that this was a farewell to a woman who, like her or loathe her, was truly out of the ordinary. Indeed, many observers noted that the pomp and ceremony of her funeral procession, with full military honors, was barely distinguishable from the state funeral accorded to a monarch. No UK prime minister has been given such a farewell since Winston Churchill died nearly half a century ago. Former Prime Ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Major, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper were just a few of the familiar faces among the departing guests. Some 50 of the guests had links to the Falkland Islands, the disputed territory over which Thatcher led Britain to war against Argentina in 1982. After receptions where relatives, dignitaries and former colleagues gathered to discuss their own memories of the politician once known as the ""Iron Lady,"" Thatcher's family accompanied her coffin to a west London crematorium for a final farewell. As Chartres said, those close to her must sometimes struggle to recognize the woman they know in the ""mythological figure"" created over decades of life in the public eye. But as her daughter, Carol, said last week, the tributes paid by foreign and British leaders on her death prove that, whatever one's views on her politics, Thatcher's ""place in history is assured."" Cameron's verdict, given via Twitter, was that the funeral was ""a fitting tribute to a great prime minister, respected around the world.""","More than 2,300 mourners fill St. Paul's Cathedral for Margaret Thatcher's funeral .

"(CNN) -- Dear Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, . My name is Ronique Laquette Smith, and I, too, am a survivor of a kidnapping. My sister and I were kidnapped by my baby sitter. In 1974, at the age of 4, I was forced to live like a fugitive on the run, from cheap motel to cheap motel -- sometimes sleeping in cars. I endured extreme abuse and neglect during my entire childhood. I only went to school for a few months or weeks at a time, till we would go on the run again. I was able to get away when I was 12. My kidnapper died in 1986, when I was 16. I had a very difficult time adjusting to the normal world. Amanda, Gina and Michelle, it is so wonderful that all of you are alive and survived your ordeal. You are very courageous. My heart is with you all. Hearing about your story, I felt it was important to share with you my journey to healing and recovery from kidnapping. It is important that you know that you are not alone. You have the love and support of your families, your community and other kidnapping victims who were rescued or escaped. You are all survivors, and you will continue to survive. It's been nearly 40 years since the kidnapping, and I am still healing. It will be my lifetime work. I was diagnosed with severe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and anxiety and have learned to manage my disorders with acupuncture and Chinese herbs, which help calm my nervous system after the trauma my body has endured. Yoga helps tame my mind by using my breath to find peace and calm after many years of trauma. I also went to the Jaycee Dugard foundation for intensive reunification healing with my family last summer in 2012. I am learning how to function in society again and most important, learning how to live again. I went back to college and should graduate in 2014. I offer you hope on this next part of your life journey. It will not be easy, but you can overcome and even thrive. My prayers are with you and your families as you come through this horrible ordeal. I will never forget what happened to me and will never understand how or why this it had to happen -- but I cannot change the past, so I must keep going forward. During my kidnapping, I lost my entire identity and couldn't remember my real name. I wanted to know who I really was and where my parents were. I contacted attorney Gloria Allred, and we decided to go to the media to tell my story in the hope that my parents would contact me. That is exactly what happened. ""Dateline NBC"" aired my story in 2011, and 37 years after my kidnapping, my real mother found me by seeing me on the show. It was a miracle. Despite being my biological mother, she had to formally adopt me. I believe I survived for a reason, in order to keep telling my story and document my own personal healing process. The healing process has been difficult but not impossible. Sometimes the transition from captivity to freedom can be almost as difficult as the transition from freedom to captivity. That certainly was the case for me. I am truly grateful to be alive and to be able to share with you. I hope it helps. As you continue to come through your ordeal, just remember to take one day, one hour, one breath at a time. You strong, brave women are in my thoughts and prayers. Peace, love and many blessings, .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court made it harder Wednesday for foreign victims of torture and other crimes against humanity to press their legal claims against corporations and others in U.S. federal courts. The outcome could have significant global impact from a moral, political and financial perspective. At issue is the scope of a federal law that is increasingly being used in an effort to hold those accountable for human rights atrocities committed overseas. A dozen Nigerian political activists now living under asylum in the United States say foreign oil companies were complicit in violence at the hands of their former country's military. Their decade-old civil damages lawsuits have been blocked from going to trial in American courts. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the unanimous court, said acts committed on foreign soil by foreign entities against foreign citizens typically cannot be resolved in American courts. ""On these facts, all the relevant conduct took place outside the United States,"" he said. ""Corporations are often present in many countries, and it would reach too far to say that mere corporate presence suffices"" to press these kinds of legal claims. The Obama administration is siding partly with the foreign businesses. The justices first heard the case in February 2012, trying to sort out whether individuals alone -- or political groups and corporations also -- are covered by broad civil immunity for alleged international law abuses. Then the court then took on another more fundamental question: whether the 1789 federal law can be applied to any conduct committed entirely outside the United States. Roberts, in his opinion, noted a ruling for the foreign plaintiffs could affect Americans living, working or traveling overseas. ""Accepting petitioners' view would imply that other nations, also applying the law of nations, could hale our citizens into their courts for alleged violations of the law of nations occurring in the United States, or anywhere else in the world,"" Roberts said. ""The presumption against extraterritoriality guards against our courts triggering such serious foreign policy consequences, and instead defers such decisions, quite appropriately, to the political branches."" The human rights appeal was filed on behalf of residents of the oil-abundant Ogoni area of the Niger River Delta. Two decades ago, they protested the longstanding environmental harm that Shell and other energy companies caused by extracting petroleum. They and their families say the Nigerian government brutally suppressed them, ""aided and abetted"" by private corporations doing business there. The Ogoni 9, as the key leaders became known, were allegedly detained, tortured and tried by a special Nigerian military tribunal, in violation of international human rights treaties. The Nigerian government's 1993-1995 crackdown sparked global outrage after author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists were convicted, then hanged. Among those bringing suit is his nephew, Charles Wiwa, who escaped the oppression and now lives in Chicago as a political refugee. He described being a student activist beaten by soldiers for hours in front of a crowd of onlookers, then detained and tortured for days. He says that Shell, based in the Netherlands and Britain, conspired with the government to keep its business operations going in the face of protests and should be held accountable for ignoring or encouraging a pattern of killings, rapes, beatings and property destruction. He said the United States is only place to obtain justice. ""Nigeria's dictatorship has grown rich from its oil,"" Wawa told CNN. ""It is important those (oil) companies be held responsible, because we cannot bring any legal action in courts in Nigeria."" The U.S. law in question is the Alien Tort Statute, which gives federal courts jurisdiction over civil claims from foreigners that they were harmed by international law violations. It was largely ignored for decades but has become an important legal vehicle for those bringing human rights claims. Similar lawsuits involve Chevron and Exxon energy operations in Indonesia; Chiquita Brand fruit farms in Colombia; and businesses that operated years ago in the now-outlawed apartheid system in South Africa. ""Shell remains firmly committed to supporting fundamental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business and I want to make clear that we deny, in the strongest possible terms, the allegations made by the plaintiffs in this tragic case,"" said Peter Rees, Shell's legal director, in response to the ruling. ""Today's decision doesn't weaken the human rights of people around the world; it makes it clear that the Alien Tort Statute does not provide a means for claims to be brought in the U.S. which have nothing to do with the U.S."" But a range of human rights groups said they were ""deeply disappointed."" ""Today's decision moves one step closer to shutting the court room doors to victims of war crimes and torture,"" said the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights. However, the organization said, ""This ruling is not a grant of immunity from liability."" The high court in 2004 endorsed the use of the statute in question, but only in limited circumstances. Wednesday's decision reinforced that approach. But the four more liberal justices, while agreeing with the court's conclusion, differed on the reasoning behind it. Justice Stephen Breyer suggested that the Alien Tort Statute should continue to have some strong enforcement application. ""International norms have long included a duty not to permit a nation to become a safe harbor for pirates (or their equivalent),"" he said, citing past Supreme Court cases. ""This approach would avoid placing the statute's jurisdictional scope at odds with its substantive objectives, holding out 'the word of promise' of compensation for victims of the torturer."" The civil lawsuits in the international law context have been compared to a separate, high-profile domestic political dispute. The high court in 2010 concluded that corporations -- businesses, unions and issue advocacy groups -- enjoy the same free speech rights as individuals when it comes to independent election spending. Now the issue in part was whether corporations and political entities should be treated the same as individual offenders when it comes to enforcing international human rights. The current case is Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. (10-1491).","Lawsuits accused foreign oil companies of being complicit in violence against Nigerians .

"(CNN) -- Before she was a princess, she was a child - shy but affectionate, respectful but mischievous. Diana Spencer, shown on her first birthday, grew up at Park House, a country estate leased from the royal family. Ten years after the death of Princess Diana, two women who helped raise the future princess are providing a new, intimate portrait of the girl who would become the ""People's Princess."" Diana Frances Spencer was born into a life of privilege. She grew up at Park House, a country home leased from the royal family's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England. Her parents, Johnnie and Frances Spencer, were well-known members of the English aristocracy. Inge Crane came to Park House as an au pair when Diana was just 3 years old. ""There's always been something special about Park House. It's difficult to put a finger on what it is,"" she said in her first interview, given exclusively to CNN. Life at the house wasn't entirely normal -- the queen's estate was about a mile away, and the young Princes Andrew and Edward (Diana's future in-laws) frequently visited to swim in the pool. When the butler would ring the gong for dinner, the children would rush to the stairs, slide down the wooden banister and run into the dining room. Despite growing up in the shadows of royalty, Crane and Mary Clarke, Diana's nanny starting at age 9, describe an ""ordinary"" childhood for Diana, a tomboy who loved going outdoors, climbing trees and playing with animals. ""She was quite a lovable child,"" Crane said. ""She was very, very cuddly.""  Watch Crane share her memories of the young Diana » . Inside Park House, however, the marriage of Diana's parents was falling apart. The divorce was finalized in 1969. Clarke said the failed marriage had a resounding effect on Diana. ""When Diana walked towards me at school, she had these downcast eyes,"" Clarke said of their first meeting, when Diana was just 9. Diana's broken home made her feel different from her classmates, Clarke said. Divorce was uncommon at that time in England. Even more unusual -- Diana's father got custody of their four children. Nearly 40 years later, Clarke still remembers their first conversation. ""She said, 'I will never marry unless I'm really in love because if you're not in love, you're going to get divorced -- and I never intend to be divorced,' "" Clarke said. ""This was quite a profound statement for a little girl to come out with."" ""Diana's dreams all through her childhood really were just to be happily married and to have a large family,"" Clarke said. Her dream, specifically, was to marry Prince Charles, 12 years her elder. While other 13-year-olds loved pop stars, Diana's boarding school room was decorated with pictures of Charles.  See family photos as CNN's Soledad O'Brien recounts friends' stories of Diana » . The young child's dreams seemingly came true when she married him just seven years later, but, like her parents' relationship, her marriage unraveled. From that first candid conversation about her aspirations, Clarke and the future princess of Wales connected. ""We always clicked from the word go,"" Clarke said. ""We worked together as a team."" Clarke had heard rumors about a mischievous Diana -- how a flurry of nannies had come and gone, including the one she locked in a bathroom. But, Clarke said, the Diana she knew never gave her ""any headaches whatsoever."" Clarke, who was 21 and had no previous experience, was given ""sole charge"" of Diana and her younger brother Charles. Diana often helped around the house and was especially nurturing toward Charles. Charles would describe his sister as the ""very essence of compassion"" at her funeral. Diana's motherly instincts were evident as she matured. As a teenager, she would become a nanny, then an assistant kindergarten teacher, and then a mother of two sons, William and Harry. Clarke remembers observing Diana's impartial love at a young age. She played with children from royalty as well as children from the village. ""They were all treated completely as equals, which is why I feel that in Diana's adult life, she ... found it so easy to interact and to mix with everyone, because to her, each person was an individual,"" Clarke said. Diana would become famous for that openness. She was photographed holding hands with a patient who was HIV positive in 1987 -- when many still believed the virus could be spread by touch. Diana devoted herself to her volunteer work, visiting the sick and campaigning for an international ban on landmines. Even as a teenager visiting patients at a mental hospital, she bonded with people -- ordinary people, disabled people -- in a way no other student could. In his funeral oration, Charles said his sister told him ""it was her innermost feelings of suffering that made it possible for her to connect with her constituency of the rejected."" She remained, he said, a ""very insecure person at heart."" As the Princess of Wales, Diana captivated the world with the same qualities that stood out to her nannies -- her affection, her vulnerability and her private misery. These qualities changed the face of the monarchy, and they keep the shy girl from a broken home just as much in the public eye, a decade after her death. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- A small boy, perched on an open catwalk in a candy factory, falls to his death. No, it is not a macabre moment out of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" It is a true story told by social reformer Jane Addams, who founded Chicago's Hull House in 1889. Addams also described little girls who refused sweets as Christmas gifts that year. ""They could not bear the sight of it,"" Addams wrote. ""We discovered that that they had worked from 7 in the morning until 9 at night, and they were exhausted."" These Dickensian scenes lasted in America from the late 19th century until 1938, when child labor was outlawed under the Fair Labor Standards Act. They are a sobering reminder of why the nation marks Labor Day. To most Americans, the first Monday in September means a three-day weekend and the last hurrah of summer, a final outing at the shore before school begins, a family picnic. But Labor Day was born in a time when work was no picnic. As America was moving from farms to factories in the Industrial Age, there was a long, violent, often-deadly struggle for fundamental workers' rights, a struggle that in many ways was America's ""other civil war."" It was a war fought when 12-hour days and six-day weeks were routine. Wages were low; there were no sick days, pensions or holidays. There was certainly no unemployment insurance. Any attempts at organizing were met by the combined wrath of business and government. The business of America was business. That conflict, a period in which thousands of workers died in America's unsafe and unsanitary factories and mines, and hundreds more died in riots and pitched battles over workers' rights, is the little-noted history behind this holiday. The first American Labor Day is dated to a parade organized by unions in New York on September 5, 1882, as a celebration of ""the strength and spirit of the American worker."" Their goals were simple: decent wages, an eight-hour workday and the right to organize. The September date was selected to provide a respite for workers and their families midway between July Fourth and Thanksgiving Day. By all accounts, the first Labor Day was a peaceful affair that drew tens of thousands of workers and their families to the city's Union Square Park. But the path to a national Labor Day holiday was no walk in the park. The federal Labor Day was created 12 years later, signed into law by President Grover Cleveland during his second term in 1894. It's not that Cleveland was a great friend of labor. In fact, he had just sent out troops to break a strike. During the economic depression known as the Panic of 1893, workers for the Pullman Car Co., one of the country's largest manufacturers, walked off their jobs when Pullman tried to cut wages, fire workers and evict them from their company-owned homes. They were joined by hundreds of thousands of workers in a nationwide walkout. Facing a strike that would shut down America's railroads, Cleveland dispatched 12,000 federal troops on the premise that the strike interfered with the U.S. Mail. In the ensuing violence, at least 13 strikers were killed. This was not the first time troops had been used against American workers. Federal soldiers, state militias and private armies, often from the Pinkerton Detective Agency, had used deadly force to break many 19th-century strikes. Some of these strikes had become pitched battles, like the Homestead strike of 1892 in Pennsylvania. There, men on both sides armed with rifles and cannons died fighting over keeping a union at a steel mill, a union that owner Andrew Carnegie and manager Henry Frick were determined to break. After crushing the Pullman strike, Cleveland thought that granting workers a Labor Day holiday was a sop that would appease them as he sought a third term. (It didn't work; he was denied the Democratic nomination in 1896.) Politicians and labor leaders were content to keep the holiday in September, far from the growing popularity of May Day as a commemoration of the ""Martyrs of Haymarket Square,"" a group of union leaders executed -- unjustly, it was later proved -- after Chicago's deadly Haymarket Square Riots in May 1884. For unions, Labor Day proved a hollow victory. Most of the reforms they sought did not come about for nearly half a century. The Depression-era fair labor laws that were passed under Franklin D. Roosevelt finally set standards like the eight-hour day and an end to child labor. This history is worth remembering on Labor Day. But at a moment when American workers are battered by high unemployment, the Great Recession, a technology revolution in the workplace and globalization, there seems to be little to celebrate. And these economic forces are only part of the relentless pressures faced by America's work force. There is also a renewed war over labor in this country. It is being fought in battleground states including, most notably, Wisconsin, Ohio, New Jersey and Florida, where mostly Republican governors are wrangling with public employees over pay, pensions and more fundamental issues including the right of collective bargaining. Their sharp anti-union rhetoric has increasingly found receptive listeners who have been convinced that ""spoiled"" unions and public employees -- the people who fight our fires, teach our children and pick up our garbage -- are at fault for our budgetary woes and the sorry state of the economy. The fight has been vitriolic but well short of the violence of America's ""other civil war."" With that in mind, it is worth recalling President Abraham Lincoln's words during the dark early days of the real Civil War. ""Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed,"" he told Congress in December 1861. ""Labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration,"" Today, the first Republican president's words would count as heresy in the GOP. But they are a sharp reminder that working men and women built this country and fought its wars. And their labors are worth more than a Monday holiday or the mean-spirited contempt they now face. They deserve, as Lincoln said, ""the higher consideration."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kenneth Davis.","Ken Davis: Today, labor under fire.

"(CNN) -- A federal court sentenced a Pakistani citizen to more than four years for providing false documentation and attempting to smuggle a person he thought was a Taliban member into the United States. Irfan Ul Haq, 37, was sentenced Thursday to 50 months in prison. His sentence is part of an agreement to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement. Ul Haq and two others -- Qasim Ali, 32, and Zahid Yousaf, 43, -- pleaded guilty in September. Ali and Yousaf were sentenced in December to 40 months and 36 months, respectively. As part of their plea deals, the three agreed to be deported after their sentences, the statement said. ""Today's sentence successfully brings to a close our prosecution of three criminals who aimed to use their human smuggling network to help a person who they believed to be a terrorist infiltrate our homeland,"" said U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. ""By convicting three Pakistani nationals who were operating out of Ecuador, we have demonstrated our ability to dismantle human smuggling operations throughout the world when they threaten our national security."" The three men were arrested in Miami last year in a federal sting operation. According to court documents, the three men were living in Quito, Ecuador, when they were contacted by federal informants who claimed they wanted to sneak a member of the Taliban into the United States. The Pakistani Taliban is designated a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. According to the court documents, the three agreed to move the person from Pakistan to the United States. Ul Haq told the federal informants it was not his concern what the purported member of the Taliban wanted to do in the United States, saying if they want to do "" hard labor, sweep floors, wash dishes in a hotel, or blow up. That will be up to them,"" the documents said. The three were arrested after accepting payment and procuring a fake Pakistani passport for the fictitious Taliban member, the court documents said.

"(CNN)  -- Authorities at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear plant were investigating what caused a weekend radiation leak that resulted in 150 workers being sent home, officials said Sunday. An airborne radiological contamination alarm sounded about 4 p.m. Saturday in the Unit 1 containment building, according to a statement from Exelon Nuclear, which operates the Three Mile Island plant near Middletown, Pennsylvania. The unit had been shut down since October 26 for refueling, maintenance and steam generator replacement, the company said. ""A monitor at the temporary opening cut into the containment building wall to allow the new steam generators to be moved inside showed a slight increase in a reading and then returned to normal,"" the company said. ""Two other monitors displayed normal readings."" Three Mile Island was the scene of the worst U.S. nuclear accident, a partial meltdown in 1979 that resulted in the plant's second reactor being shut down permanently. Tests showed the contamination in Saturday's incident was confined to the building itself, and none was found outside, Exelon said. There was no threat to public health and safety, but the workers were sent home because they could not continue until the area was cleaned, Bill Noll, Exelon vice president, said in the Saturday statement. One worker was found to have received 16 millirem of exposure, and others received lower levels of contamination. The annual occupational dose limit for workers at Exelon plants is 2,000 millirem, the statement said. Radiation exposure from a chest X-ray is about 6 millirem, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Although Noll said it was hoped work would resume at Unit 1 on Sunday, Exelon spokeswoman Beth Archer told CNN on Sunday it had not resumed, as the cause of the leak was still under investigation. Two radiation specialists from the NRC were scheduled to investigate Sunday. ""Numerous work activities were going on in the building at the time the alarm sounded, and Exelon engineers are working to determine the cause of the incident,"" the statement said. The March 1979 accident at Three Mile Island brought the nuclear industry to a standstill. The partial meltdown of Unit 2's nuclear core resulted in no injuries to plant workers or nearby community members, but it triggered changes in nuclear power plant operations and emergency planning and led to tighter oversight of the industry by the NRC. The Unit 2 reactor is permanently shut down and defueled, the NRC said. In 2001, FirstEnergy acquired it and contracted its monitoring to Exelon, which owns Unit 1. The companies plan to keep Unit 2 in ""long-term, monitored storage"" until the Unit 1 operating license expires, at which time both plants will be decommissioned, the NRC said.

"Washington (CNN) -- P.J. Crowley abruptly resigned Sunday as State Department spokesman over controversial comments he made about the Bradley Manning case. Sources close to the matter said the resignation, first reported by CNN, came under pressure from the White House, where officials were furious about his suggestion that the Obama administration is mistreating Manning, the Army private who is being held in solitary confinement in Quantico, Virginia, under suspicion that he leaked highly classified State Department cables to the website WikiLeaks. Speaking to a small group at MIT last week, Crowley was asked about allegations that Manning is being tortured and kicked up a firestorm by answering that what is being done to Manning by Defense Department officials ""is ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid."" Crowley did add that ""nonetheless, Bradley Manning is in the right place"" because of his alleged crimes, according to a blog post by BBC reporter Philippa Thomas, who was present at Crowley's talk. ""The unauthorized disclosure of classified information is a serious crime under U.S. law,"" Crowley said in a statement Sunday. ""My recent comments regarding the conditions of the pre-trial detention of Private First Class Bradley Manning were intended to highlight the broader, even strategic impact of discreet actions undertaken by national security agencies every day and their impact on our global standing and leadership. ""The exercise of power in today's challenging times and relentless media environment must be prudent and consistent with our laws and values,"" Crowley said. ""Given the impact of my remarks, for which I take full responsibility, I have submitted my resignation."" Crowley has told friends that he is deeply concerned that mistreatment of Manning could undermine the legitimate prosecution of the young private. Crowley has also made clear he has the Obama administration's best interests at heart because he thinks any mistreatment of Manning could be damaging around the world to President Obama, who has tried to end the perception that the United States tortures prisoners. Nevertheless, Crowley's political fate was sealed Friday when Obama was asked at a White House news conference about his comments regarding Manning. Obama revealed that he had asked Pentagon officials ""whether or not the procedures that have been taken in terms of (Manning's) confinement are appropriate and are meeting our basic standards."" In a comment that drew howls of protest from liberals, Obama added that Pentagon officials ""assure me that they are. I can't go into details about some of their concerns, but some of this has to do with Private Manning's safety as well."" Manning's treatment has become a flashpoint for liberals, with Amnesty International noting he has been confined to a windowless cell for 23 hours a day, is stripped down to his boxers at night and is not given pillows or blankets. Manning's lawyer also says the young private recently had to sleep in the nude because defense officials thought there was a suicide threat and decided to take away his boxer shorts. Crowley is highly respected on foreign policy matters, dating back to his time as National Security Council spokesman under then-President Bill Clinton. He has been the Obama administration's public face on many international stories as the daily briefer at the State Department for Secretary Hillary Clinton. But he has not had a completely smooth relationship with officials in the Obama White House, and eyebrows were raised several months ago when White House aide Mike Hammer was sent over to the State Department to serve as Crowley's deputy. A senior White House official stressed that Crowley's exit was in the works for months and said the MIT incident only ""hastened that departure."" ""Everybody likes P.J. This was more a situation where it wasn't the right fit,"" said the official, noting there were times when Crowley wasn't on the same page as Clinton, let alone the White House. Hammer will replace Crowley as the assistant secretary for public affairs, Clinton said in a statement Sunday. She said she accepted Crowley's resignation ""with regret."" ""P.J. has served our nation with distinction for more than three decades, in uniform and as a civilian,"" she said. ""His service to country is motivated by a deep devotion to public policy and public diplomacy, and I wish him the very best."" A little-known factor in Crowley's comments about Manning was revealed Saturday by April Ryan, a White House correspondent for American Urban Radio who covered Crowley in the Clinton White House. Ryan wrote on Twitter that Crowley ""dislikes treatment of prisoners as his father was a Prisoner of War."" While it's true that Crowley's father was imprisoned during World War II, people close to him downplay that as a major factor in his comments about Manning, saying the biggest factor is simply that Crowley believes what he said. In his statement, Crowley said he leaves with ""great admiration and affection"" for his colleagues and ""deep respect for the journalists who report on foreign policy and global developments every day, in many cases under dangerous conditions and subject to serious threats. Their efforts help make governments more responsible, accountable and transparent.""","NEW: Crowley's exit was in the works for months, White House official says .

"(CNN) -- The death of a U.S. Army captain who died while engaged in a video chat with his wife from Afghanistan remained under investigation Saturday, the family said. Capt. Bruce Kevin Clark was in Tarin Kowt, about 85 miles (140 kilometers) north of Kandahar, when he died during a Skype session with his wife. Clarence Davis, a spokesman for the William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, where Clark was based, said that it has not been determined how Clark died and that the case is under investigation. Clark's family said in a statement that they'd hoped for ""a miracle"" after his wife Susan saw what happened to Clark during their chat on Monday, but ""it was not to be."" They did not elaborate as to what took place. ""Although the circumstances were unimaginable, Bruce's wife and extended family will be forever thankful that he and his wife were together in his last moments,"" Clark's wife and family said Friday. Clark -- known by many as Kevin -- was a chief nurse in the Army who amassed many honors in his military career, according to his family. Those include an Army Commendation Medal, Military Outstanding Volunteer Service, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and an Army Service Medal. The longtime resident of Spencerport, New York, joined the Army in September 2006 and served, among other places, at the Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, according to a Beaumont Army Medical Center statement. More recently, he was based at that medical facility in southwest Texas and assigned to the Army's A Company, Troop Command. ""He loved being in the military,"" his sister-in-law Mariana Barry told CNN affiliate WHAM in upstate New York. ""He was absolutely willing to make any sacrifice, and it's just horrible that this is the sacrifice he ended up making."" His commander described Clark, 43, as ""awesome,"" ""professional"" and ""a great asset, leader and friend,"" the family said. After his death, special operations troops from the United States and Australia lined up to give him his final send-off from Afghanistan. And on Thursday, his casket was wrapped in an American flag as it was transported off a military plane onto the tarmac of Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, according to the U.S. Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operation. While no dates have been given, the family said that Clark's funeral will be in Spencerport and a memorial service will be held in Addison, Michigan. In addition, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed that all flags at state government buildings be flown at half-staff Monday in Clark's honor, as he's done with other Empire State troops who have died in combat zones. In addition to his wife, Clark is survived by two daughters. Dozens have posted comments on a Facebook tribute page set up in Clark's honor, some of them from people who knew him and his family personally and others from strangers wishing to thank him for his service. ""He was an excellent nurse, a fierce patient advocate, and loved to teach students. But what I remember most about him is the great love he had for his wife and beautiful little girls,"" one woman wrote. ""I have no doubt that Bruce will be watching them and loving them forever more."" Barry said that her sister Susan is ""being strong"" for her daughters and that the entire family is committed to stepping up -- just like Clark did. ""We're going to try to take care of my sister and my nieces the way that Kevin would have taken care of them, and the way he would have wanted us to take care of them,"" Barry said.

"(CNN) -- Earlier this year, the Justice Department filed a $5 billion lawsuit against Standard & Poor's -- one of the nation's Big Three credit rating agencies, which also include Moody's and Fitch. The lawsuit accuses S&P of knowingly giving AAA ratings to financial products the agency's analysts understood to be unworthy. Handing out sparkling ratings to deeply flawed securities represents a serious breach of trust on the part of a credit rating agency. But it was common practice for the Big Three. And in no small way, this practice enabled the financial meltdown of 2008. Under the current so-called ""issuer pays"" model, agencies are paid by the Wall Street firms whose products they are rating. The agencies thus have a financial motive to satisfy issuers with a high rating: If an agency declines to give a particular product its seal of approval, the issuer can simply take its business -- and its fees -- elsewhere. In the lead-up to the financial crisis, the Big Three gave out AAA ratings to subprime mortgage-backed securities. The securities, of course, turned out to be toxic, but the agencies were paid anyway. What's worse, when Wall Street ran out of questionable mortgages to securitize, it created a whole new market based on bets on those securities, bets called ""derivatives."" The Big Three kept on handing out AAA ratings to these complicated new products, and were again paid handsomely to do so. The rating agencies made hundreds of millions of dollars, but in the end, it was American taxpayers who paid the price -- losing their savings, their homes and their jobs in addition to having to pay billions to bail out banks. In the wake of that catastrophe, there is bipartisan agreement that the credit ratings process needs serious reform. That is why we worked together on an amendment to the Dodd-Frank financial reform law -- and why the Franken-Wicker provision passed with bipartisan support. Our amendment was designed to bring accountability and transparency to the ratings process. In short, we want to replace pay-for-play with pay-for-performance, opening up the ratings process and establishing a competitive marketplace that rewards accuracy. The final version of Dodd-Frank required that the Securities and Exchange Commission complete a study of the ratings system before acting. Nearly three years later, that study is complete, finding that ""inherent"" conflicts of interest in the system contributed to the 2008 crisis. At our urging, the SEC held a roundtable earlier this week to discuss moving forward. During the open comment period on its report, the SEC received just 32 letters on the issue -- six of them coming from rating agencies. We are pleased that the roundtable sought greater public engagement, including input from the investors and consumer advocates. But now comes the real test of whether the SEC is truly committed to preventing another recession. Ultimately, the decision to move forward will be led by its new chair, Mary Jo White. White's close ties to the financial industry -- she was a defense attorney for many of Wall Street's biggest players -- have rightly raised concerns about her ability to police it. Her defenders argue that, as a former prosecutor who's taken on gangsters and terrorists, White won't be bullied into going easy on bad actors in our financial sector. But it's up to White to prove that she's up to the task. And how aggressively she takes on the credit rating industry after the roundtable is the first key test to demonstrate that her Wall Street background won't impede her ability to be the watchdog we need. It will also be a test of how serious the Obama administration is about preventing another financial meltdown. Make no mistake: we will be watching closely that, under her leadership, the SEC will implement credible reform. A responsible credit rating industry is critical to protecting the public interest -- and there is bipartisan support for reform that restores accountability, transparency and integrity to the system. This week's roundtable was a step forward. We hope that the new SEC head will follow through on the reform that, as we learned the hard way in 2008, is long overdue. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Al Franken and Roger Wicker.","Franken, Wicker: Justice Dept. sued S&P for fraud in AAA ratings ahead of financial crisis .

"New York (CNN) -- Protesters will resist any efforts to remove them from the Lower Manhattan park where they have been camped for nearly a month, despite Mayor Michael Bloomberg's order that they vacate the park at 7 a.m. Friday so it can be cleaned, an organizer said Thursday. ""Come tomorrow morning, we will passively resist and make it as difficult a process to remove us as possible,"" said Occupy Wall Street spokesman Tyler Combelic. ""It's not an occupation if you can't occupy the park."" His words appeared to be backed up by the sentiment of the crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who filled Zuccotti Park Thursday night. ""All day! All week! Occupy Wall Street!"" they chanted. Combelic called the mayor's announcement a ""not-so-veiled attempt"" to force protesters from the park, setting up a possible confrontation with authorities. Protesters descended on the privately owned park near the New York Stock Exchange on September 17 to protest the nation's ailing economy. ""You want to clean up something? Clean up these crooks on Wall Street,"" said City Council Member Charles Barron. Daniel Mintz of MoveOn.Org said he was planning to deliver to Bloomberg more than 350,000 petitions and signatures he received Thursday from supporters around the nation. ""The mayor would do a lot better cleaning up Wall Street than cleaning up the plaza,"" he said. ""The park is clean,"" said Letitia James, a councilwoman from Brooklyn. ""The issue of cleanliness is a ruse, a disguise and nothing more than an excuse to end OWS."" Some protesters could be seen sweeping up debris. Others said they have used donated funds to clean the park. A number of unions have pledged to support demonstrations cropping up in cities nationwide. Maida Rosenstein, president of UAW local 2110, said members of her chapter planned to gather at the park at 7 a.m., when the cleaning is scheduled to begin. ""If the mayor thinks he's going to evict these protesters and end these protests, he needs to know that New Yorkers are watching,"" Rosenstein said. ""The unions are going to be there tomorrow and are also watching."" Bloomberg met Wednesday with protesters and told them that the decision to clean the park was made after owners voiced concerns about ""unsanitary conditions and considerable wear and tear on the park."" ""The mayor is a strong believer in the First Amendment and believes that the protesters have a right to continue to protest,"" Deputy Mayor for Operations Cas Holloway said in a written statement. But the situation in the park is ""not in the best interests of the protesters, residents or the city,"" he said. The cleaning is to be done in stages, and protesters will be allowed to return to the park as areas are cleaned if they obey the rules set forth by the owners, Brookfield Properties, the statement said. ""The park has not been cleaned in four weeks, a process that is normally undertaken every night,"" Brookfield said Thursday in a statement. ""Our goal is to keep the park clean, safe, and accessible to all."" A walk in the park Thursday night found it in orderly shape. The only distinctive smell was an occasional waft of marijuana smoke. Loads of cardboard boxes holding clothes and other personal belongings were neatly tied up in one area; garbage bags were piled in garbage-collection areas; a number of people were cleaning up. Authorities have distributed a pamphlet at the park outlining a list of rules for protesters after the scheduled cleanup. The rules prohibit camping or pitching tents; lying on the ground or on benches; placing tarps or sleeping bags on the ground; using bicycles, skateboards or skates; and storing personal property that interferes with park use. Zuccotti Park was built for the general public, but the weeks-long protest has raised concerns among area business owners and residents about sanitation. The protest campaign began in July with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and a sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange. For almost a month, demonstrations have addressed such issues as police brutality, union busting and the economy, the group said. Organizers have taken inspiration from this year's Arab Spring protests that swept through North Africa and the Middle East. Crowds have taken up residence in the park in New York's financial district, and organizers have called for 20,000 people to flood the area for a ""few months.""

"(CNN) -- When Hollywood star Richard Gere selected the decor for the Bedford Post -- the boutique hotel he co-owns with his wife and fellow actor Carey Lowell -- there was one thing above all else that he wanted to embody in the design. ""Sex -- every choice in here was about sex,"" joked Gere, as he took CNN's Richard Quest on a tour of the eight-bedroom luxury inn. This amorous sentiment was echoed in a slightly less forward fashion by Lowell, who said ""romance"" and ""intimacy"" were key inspirations behind the hotel's design. She said they had tried to create an open atmosphere where guests feel at home and comfortable to be themselves. ""It's just a relaxed place,"" she said, adding that each room had been designed to exude a ""serene"" aura -- reflected in the muted palette and earthy tones used throughout the inn. See also: Marriott mogul's 55 years of hotels . Situated on the outskirts of the sleepy town of Bedford, in upstate New York, the Bedford Post is a renovated old country home that dates back to the 18th century. The movie-star couple bought the house after spotting it whilst horse riding in the area. At the time it was derelict, on the point of collapse, but they have renovated it to meet the specifications of a luxury retreat. Both were keen to highlight, however, that they have been careful to remain true to the site's rustic charms. ""All the stone walls are from rocks that were here,"" Lowell told Quest, with Gere adding that many of its wood beams date back to the original building. See also: World's most outrageous hotel amenities . Among its amenities, a yoga room provides communal space for exercise and meditation, while a restaurant, bar and cafe serve up gourmet food for hotel guests and Bedford residents alike. It was this opportunity to create a gathering point for the residents of Bedford that Gere, the star of hit films Pretty Woman and An Officer and a Gentleman, says inspired him to open the hotel. ""This is an area with some extremely successful people and many different (types) of human experience,"" said Gere. ""I thought this could be the center of this village ... (a) place where people could come and discuss the world and how we can affect it in a positive way,"" he added.","Richard Gere and Carey Lowell have a boutique hotel in upstate New York.

"(CNN) -- Crowds gathered in somber reflection near the Rwandan capital of Kigali on Tuesday, marking the 15th anniversary of the start of a 100-day genocidal massacre in Rwanda in which an estimated 800,000 people were brutally killed. Rwandan President Paul Kagame, right, meets with former South Africa President Nelson Mandela in March. Rwandan President Paul Kagame addressed thousands during an emotional candle-lighting ceremony, criticizing the international community for not doing more to prevent the bloody wave of violence. ""I remind those experts that they need to go back to school,"" Kagame told reporters. ""These children you saw here -- you think they are standing there because they are exploiting everybody's guilt? Sparked by the assassination of then-Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, extremist militias made up of ethnic Hutus slaughtered ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus across Rwanda after Belgian peacekeepers left the country. During a ceremony at the United Nations, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon reflected on what he described as a ""horrifying scene and experience."" ""Today is a day to open our eyes to this suffering and honor the memory of those killed in Rwanda 15 years ago,"" he said. ""But beyond reminding us of the horror, that silence should spur us to action."" In a White House statement, U.S. President Barack Obama called for a period of reflection. ""As we mourn their senseless passing, we must also acknowledge the courageous men and women who survived the genocide and have since demonstrated remarkable strength and generosity in forgiving those who committed these heinous acts,"" Obama said. Among them was a former Kigali hotel owner named Paul Rusesabagina. Fifteen years ago, he sheltered 1,200 Tutsis and moderate Hutus as machete-wielding gangs cut down hundreds of thousands outside his hotel walls. ""I did all I could during that time,"" Rusesabagina told CNN in a 2006 interview. ""We knew there were intentions between Hutus and Tutsis,"" he said. ""But we never believed that people can be so cruel -- can be so wild."" Rusesabagina's efforts were later highlighted in the 2004 Hollywood film ""Hotel Rwanda,"" starring Don Cheadle, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Rusesabagina, and Nic Nolte. The genocide ended when Tutsi-led militias backing Kagame ousted the Hutu government supporting the massacre. Candlelight vigils across Rwanda are expected throughout the week in commemoration.","Candle-lighting ceremony marks 15th anniversary of 100-day massacre in Rwanda .

"(CNN) -- Reports of young children developing premature or inappropriate sex characteristics have prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to require a boxed label warning on two testosterone gel products. Men use testosterone gels if they no longer produce testosterone or produce it in low amounts. The FDA announced Thursday that these children had experienced adverse effects in growth and sexual development after coming into contact with adults who used the products. Specifically, young girls developed male sex characteristics, and boys prematurely developed male sex characteristics . The gels, AndroGel and Testim, are approved for use in men who produce little or no testosterone. In 2007, there were 1.4 million prescriptions dispensed for AndroGel -- 25,000 of which were for women -- and 370,000 for Testim. Some women use testosterone gel products off-label, perhaps to increase sex drive, but the FDA has not approved these products for any reason in women. Other non-FDA approved products are sold over the Internet. The agency has not reviewed the safety and efficacy of these products and does not know how widely they are sold. In explaining how a child might have been exposed, Dr. Dianne Murphy, director of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics at the FDA, suggested that a gel user might  forget to wash his or her hands or cover treated areas, or may have not waited for skin to dry, and then picked up the child and held him or her to the upper body. The ratio of skin surface area to total body size of a child is much greater than in an adult, Murphy said. That means that a small area on an adult's body corresponds to a greater percentage of surface area on a child's body. The FDA has reviewed eight cases of children ages 9 months to 5 years who developed symptoms as a result of exposure to the gel up to December 1. Abnormal effects included inappropriate enlargement of the genitalia, premature development of pubic hair, advanced bone age, increased libido and aggressive behavior. Although most children's signs and symptoms regressed after they were no longer exposed to the gel, in a few cases the enlarged genitalia did not return to normal, and the bone age was still higher than the child's chronological age, the FDA said. One of these children required surgical intervention, the FDA said.  Some children also had to undergo invasive diagnostic procedures. More than a dozen additional reported cases are currently under review by FDA. Androgel is applied to the upper arms and shoulders and abdomen once per day, and Testim is applied to the upper arms and shoulders once per day, said Dr. Mark Hirsch of the FDA. The current labels instruct users to wash their hands after use, and to cover treated skin with clothing. When product users applied gel to body parts that were not indicated in the product's labeling, they ""increased the opportunity for a child to be inadvertently exposed,"" she said. The FDA recommends that children and women avoid contact with the places where men have applied these products. The agency also recommends that adults who use testosterone gels do the following: . • Wash hands with soap and water after every application.  • Cover the application site with clothing when gel has dried.  • Wash the site where the gel was applied with soap and water before coming into skin contact with another person.  • Note that the use of non-FDA-approved testosterone gels that can result the same effects should be avoided.","AndroGel and Testim approved for use in men who produce little or no testosterone .

"(CNN) -- A helicopter runs out of fuel midair after its pilot was evidently flying with one hand and texting with another. The chopper crashes, killing everyone on board. It sounds incredible, but it's true. We live in a multitasking society. That's a reality. Now some experts wonder whether that reality is clashing with the safe operation of our nation's aircraft. Distraction in the cockpit was a key element of testimony delivered Tuesday on a deadly 2011 medivac helicopter crash. The pilot was violating Federal Aviation Administration rules and company policy by using his phone in flight. Yet in some cases, the use of other types of personal electronic devices in the cockpit is still allowed. Read details from the NTSB accident investigation (pdf) But that may be changing. Experts and officials say a total ban on using personal electronic devices in the cockpit is needed. ""You can't multitask everything,"" said John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is the nation's top aviation investigation agency. ""To think that you can text and fly, especially a helicopter, is ludicrous. Helicopters require concentration, even more so than many airplanes."" Medivac chopper pilots fall under the same rules for electronic communications devices as commercial airplanes. Goglia and other experts favor stricter FAA rules for all aircraft, including helicopter ambulances. Under a newly proposed FAA rule, commercial pilots would be banned at all times from using ""a wireless communications device or laptop computer for personal use while at their duty station on the flight deck while the aircraft is being operated."" Nonflight related conversations, including via electronic devices, are banned during take off and landing and during flight below 10,000 feet. Above 10,000 feet, commercial pilots can use tablets and laptops. Yet laptop distractions were blamed in an embarrassing 2009 incident where Northwest pilots overshot their destination by 150 miles. The FAA cited that blunder as a factor in its January proposal to toughen the current rules, which haven't been updated since 1981. Laptops and tablet computers such as iPads have been around for years. The Northwest incident happened in 2009, so why is the FAA only now getting around to stiffening the rules? ""The FAA is behind the curve across the board,"" said Goglia. ""The rule making process has become so cumbersome that even when there's a strong desire to change the rules, it still takes forever."" When tougher rules might go into effect is uncertain, the FAA said. The agency says it is reviewing comments on their proposal. It's a challenging time for the FAA to respond quickly to rapidly changing technology, said former Department of Transportation Inspector General Mary Schiavo. ""It's kind of a learning phase ... a work in progress really."" She said the FAA has been hampered recently by less than ideal congressional leadership on aviation issues. The FAA points out that its longstanding policy has always prohibited ""during a critical phase of flight"" any activity that would distract from the safe operation of an aircraft. Even if personal electronic devices are banned during flight, pilots often use text-based systems to communicate with controllers on the ground. The difference is in situational awareness. Using technology that folds into flight operations is directly connected to the job at hand. Making dinner plans is not. Pilots follow an approved FAA process. ""One pilot tells the other that he's going heads down for a minute,"" Goglia explained. ""That's his signal that the other pilot has to pay more attention."" When it comes to single pilots flying alone, operating heads-down technology is supposed to be very limited, Goglia said, but it's still a problem that the FAA needs to address.","Texting factored into deadly medivac helicopter crash .

"London (CNN) -- When it comes to the Renaissance, few of us would immediately equate the rich cultural fruits of the period with the birth of the modern banking system. But a new exhibition in Florence is showing just how intertwined the two really were. Entitled ""Money and Beauty: Bankers, Botticelli and the Bonfire of the Vanities,"" the exhibition in Florence's Palazzo Strozzi looks at how Florence's famous families got rich -- and how they then used their wealth to commission works from some of the world's most celebrated artists. According to the Palazzo's Director General James Bradburne, the idea for the show had been in development since 2006, but it would be another two years before it was cemented as a particularly apt exploration of the city's history. ""September 2008 rolls around and we're talking about the development of the show and Lehman Brothers goes bust, which made the whole idea very timely,"" he said. The show's trajectory takes in the birth of the Medici bank and its use of relatively new financial systems, including letters of exchange (an ingenious type of lending that managed to get around usury laws by changing foreign currencies and profiting on exchange rather than interest rates), right up to its collapse at the end of the 15th century. Included in the show are paintings by Sandro Botticelli, who had a close relationship with the Medicis, as well as paintings of the new mercantile class and their novel activities by artists such as Dutch painter Marinus van Reymerswaele. And gold -- whether in the form of coins or the golden halos hovering over depictions of the holy family -- is one of the exhibition's dominant themes and materials. The exhibition is curated by English writer Tim Parks, author of ""Medici Money: Banking, Metaphysics and Art in Fifteenth-Century Florence,"" and Ludovica Sebregondi, an Italian art historian and author of ""Iconography of Girolamo Savonarola, 1495 -1998."" Both show how the bankers, worried that their activities might be contravening their religious beliefs, poured money into building churches and commissioning devotional paintings -- often with themselves inserted into them. ""The bankers were never quite sure whether (the letter of exchange) was usury of not, a lot of theologians said it was and a lot of theologians said it wasn't,"" Parks explained. ""So you have a situation where these bankers, who were often very devout men, were making penitential gestures towards the church just in case,"" he said. The influence of their new wealth, he said, is evident in the paintings of the holy family, where the Virgin is frequently depicted wearing sumptuous Florentine clothes and the artists use significant amounts of gold. ""You could say that some of these gestures were simply penitential, but then the banker begins to realize that in giving them money he can also begin to define the image that is produced by his money, and of course one of the things he instinctively does, whether it's conscious or not, is to use the image to change the attitude to money, that is, begin to use the image to undermine the resistance to money,"" said Parks. Money was feared, he said, not only because Christianity espoused poverty but crucially because it allowed for social mobility and therefore undermine the set Medieval hierarchies. Still, for a few years, the Medicis were in charge of papal finances. And, said Parks, the artists were often happy to oblige in order to ensure their own economic prosperity. Sebregondi, for her part, doesn't believe that the artworks commissioned necessarily spoke of cynicism on the part of the patrons or the artists. ""Patrons wanted works of art to highlight their wealth and their power, but the beauty aspect allowed them to ""purify"" their money, to shake off the vulgarity and the sense of sin that has always been associated with it,"" she said. Regardless of their efforts, there was a backlash, personified at the end of the 15th century by the preacher Girolamo Savonarola, who railed against the lavish lives of the rich and encouraged artists such as Botticelli to throw their works onto ""bonfires of the vanities."" The exhibition ends with a section on Savonarola and includes the turbulent, later paintings of Botticelli, who Sebregondi believes was tormented by ""emotional anguish."" It was a tumultuous time, said Bradburne, with some echoes of our current predicament. ""It is not a coincidence, any more then than now, that wealth and the investment in certain kinds of expression of wealth are related,"" he said. ""One might say (the banker's money) basically funded the Renaissance,"" Sebregondi concluded.

"(CNN) -- Spanish soccer giants Real Madrid increased the value of their club by 76% over the past year to usurp Manchester United as the world's most valuable football team. A study by financial experts Forbes found that Real Madrid's value now stands at $3.3 billion, knocking the English Premier League champions elect off the top of the list for the first time since the study began in 2004. Confounding the increasingly difficult economic conditions in Spain, Real, managed by Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho, have increased revenues to $650 million. Their operating income of $134 million is second only to the $227 million amassed by the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, which is the highest of all sports teams. Manchester United, on the brink of securing a record 20th English top flight title, increased their value by 42% to $3.17 billion, according to Forbes. Despite dropping to second behind Real, United have boosted revenues with a share issue and by signing bumper sponsorship deals. Their seven-year shirt sponsorship deal with U.S. car giant Chevrolet is worth $559 million while an eight-year agreement with insurance firm Aon is thought to be worth $230 million. All England's top flight clubs have been boosted by an increase in television revenue with the combined domestic and overseas rights having the potential to top $6 billion, Forbes say. Real's arch rivals Barcelona are third on the list with a value of $2.6 billion, English club Arsenal lie fourth on $1.32 billion while German champions Bayern Munich sit fifth on $1.3 billion. The top 20 clubs, all but one of which are European, are worth an average of $968 million, which is up 26% on last year. David Beckham, who now plays for French club Paris Saint-Germain, is again the best-paid soccer star with earnings of $50.6 million while Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo is second on $43.5m. Barcelona's Lionel Messi is third on $40.3m. Forbes say they value teams by calculating their ""enterprise values (equity plus debt) that are based on multiples of revenue that teams garner from television, premium seating, media, licensing, merchandise and concessions."" But speaking to CNN, sports business expert Simon Chadwick questioned the relevance of measuring value in this way. ""Real Madrid, Manchester United and Barcelona are all in the top-10 list of the most indebted clubs in the world, even if their revenue streams are healthy and strongly established,"" he said. ""The implication of measuring value in this way seems to be that many clubs in the top-10 are simply buying their success by signing players, building debt and winning trophies. ""It will be interesting to see the extent to which the UEFA Financial Fair Play initiative moderates valuations in coming Forbes league tables."" UEFA's new rules are designed to make Europe's clubs live within their means and attempt to break even each year, though there is an allowance for debt in the initial stages of their strategy. Chadwick believes the figures underline just how immune soccer is to the financial difficulties being experienced in Europe. He says the upward spiral shows no signs of abating. ""While football clubs clearly have tremendous financial value and commercial potential, some of the figures being reported here are staggering,"" he added. ""For Real Madrid to almost double its financial value in 12 months is incredible, especially set against the backdrop of economic austerity (particularly in Spain) and competition from other sports and industrial sectors. ""If these figures are a truly accurate and rigorous measure of value, then they are stunning. Even at the top-end of the game, clubs are relatively underdeveloped as commercial entities. ""With changes in management practice, a stronger commercial emphasis, and global marketplace development, then one can only speculate how much further the value of top clubs might increase.""","Real Madrid are the world's most valuable football club according to Forbes .

"London (CNN) -- In the years leading up to 2011, several celebrities, royals and politicians had claimed to have had their phones hacked by News of The World. The paper's royal editor and a private investigator had even been convicted of intercepting phone messages and spent time in prison. The story was covered on the inside pages of selected newspapers but failed to really capture the British public's attention. That all changed in July of that year when the Guardian reported that police suspected the cellphone of murdered teenager Milly Dowler had been hacked by News of the World and that messages had been deleted to free up space for new voicemail. The allegations sparked outrage: amid condemnation from politicians on all sides of the spectrum, the paper's boss Rupert Murdoch closed down the 168-year-old tabloid newspaper and paid Dowler's parents and charities more than $4 million in compensation. At a parliamentary inquiry into the allegations, Murdoch declared: ""This is the most humble day of my life."" Timeline of phone-hacking scandal . When Milly's parents appeared at the Leveson Inquiry set up by the government to investigate press ethics, they gave a raw assessment of the false hope that the deletion of messages had raised in the days after their daughter's disappearance in March 2002. ""I rang her phone,"" recalled Sally Dowler. ""It clicked through on to her voicemail, so I heard her voice and it was just like, 'she's picked up her voicemail, she's alive.'"" Tragically, those hopes were dashed and six months later Milly's body was found in woodland in Hampshire in southern England. Although it was suspected that the deletion of the messages hampered the police investigation, the truth may have been more prosaic: later that year a lawyer acting for the country's biggest force, the Metropolitan Police, said there was no evidence News of the World had been responsible for deleting the messages. The Guardian issued a clarification, but the damage had been done to News of the World and Murdoch's reputation. Whatever took place, the fact remains that it took police nine years to bring nightclub bouncer Levi Bellfield to justice. In June 2011 he was found guilty of murdering Milly Dowler and sentenced to life imprisonment. During the trial the jury was told Bellfield had previously murdered two other women and attempted to kill a fourth. So who was the girl whose murder in a quiet suburb of southwest London led to the closure of the UK's top-selling paper, suspicions of collusion between police officers and journalists, and at one time even threatened to topple Murdoch from the media group he had led for half a century? The scandal also led to charges being brought against several Murdoch employees, including two of Prime Minister David Cameron's friends. Press dishes it out, but can it take it? Despite her extraordinary legacy, by most accounts Amanda Dowler, who was known as Milly, was a normal, bright 13-year-old schoolgirl who had a good relationship with her parents and elder sister Gemma. Her friends testified during Bellfield's trial in London that she had a sunny personality and was her normal self on the day of her disappearance. ""She was one of the funniest people I had ever met,"" Danielle Sykes said in a statement. ""She would always be trying to make people laugh, joking and smiling. ""She was one of those sort of people that when she was happy she was exceptionally happy, an infectious personality. If she was sad about something she would be particularly sad and get upset. She valued her friendships and family a lot."" Sykes, who was one of the last people to see Milly alive, said she ate chips with her friend in a cafÃ© in Walton-on-Thames after school. ""We parted and I gave her a hug and asked if she would be alright walking home on her own and she said, 'Yeah, I'll be absolutely fine.' ""I then turned around and shouted back at her 'I would not tell anyone what we had been talking about.'"" Sykes added that they had been discussing a boy whom Milly fancied. After the friends parted, Milly started to walk to her home nearby, but was snatched by Bellfield as she walked along a road. Milly's sister also told the court she knew instinctively something was wrong when she returned home to find the house empty. She said: ""I knew Milly wouldn't go out without telling Mum or Dad. I rang Milly's mobile. It was switched off so I left a message on her answer phone telling her to come home because Dad was really annoyed. ""I was worried because Milly would always ring to tell us she was going to be late. It was so unusual for her not to be home on time. I knew instinctively something bad had happened to Milly and that she had been abducted."" Milly's disappearance sparked a nationwide search involving more than 100 police officers and a reconstruction of her last movements on the TV program ""Crimewatch."" Detectives from Surrey police however suggested she had not been taken by force and had run away. Some friends indeed portrayed a different side to Milly, suggesting she had been ""distressed"" at the time of disappearance, after finding bondage pornography belonging to her father Robert. Police initially considered him a suspect, but later apologized. In a statement read to the court, Jacqueline Pignolly said: ""Milly told me some pornographic magazines had been found in her Dad's drawer. ""At the time Milly was a bit upset about it, not much for herself but her mum. I know that Milly did see them and there was more than one of them."" During the trial Bellfield's lawyers used this testimony, along with a ""goodbye"" note that Milly had written to her parents and a poem in which she said ""I hate myself,"" to paint a picture of the teenager as unhappy and distressed. His tactics caused great distress to the family, but the jury failed to believe his plea of innocence. Geoffrey Wansell, the author of a book on Bellfield, ""The Bus Stop Killer,"" told CNN that in the wake of the 2011 trial, during which the Dowlers were pilloried by the tabloids over the pornography revelations, the family grew to loathe the press. It was in this atmosphere that the revelation was made about the hacking of Milly's phone, which became, according to Wansell, ""the defining moment from which News of the World could not recover."" ""I don't think it's as simple as the fact that Milly Dowler's phone was hacked and that led to the end of the News of the World. I think there are more layers to the story than that, and we may never know what actually happened.""","Police said in 2011 that Milly Dowler's voicemail hacked by News of the World .

"Joplin, Missouri (CNN) -- On the blank canvas left behind by last year's tornado, new homes are slowly popping up in Joplin, Missouri. Every few blocks the buzz of power saws and the pop-pop-pop of nail guns from construction crews signal another step toward making the city whole again. ""Joplin is on the mend,"" said Mayor Melodie Colbert-Kean. ""We have a long road to travel, but the way that everyone is joining together and unifying and chipping in, we're going to make it."" What Joplin needs now . A year ago, the city suffered a direct hit by a massive EF5 tornado with wind speeds over 200 mph. The May 22 twister leveled homes and businesses, killing 161 people. ""A third of the city got pretty much destroyed by the tornado,"" Colbert-Kean said. ""Total devastation, a war zone, that's what it looked like to me."" After the search and rescue finished, the cleanup began. Most of the 3 million cubic yards of debris left by the tornado was removed in the first few months after the storm, leaving behind an eerie, treeless tableau. After devastating tornado, Missouri hospital to be demolished . In the middle of this destruction, the iconic cross at St. Mary's Catholic Church still stands, giving hope to many in Joplin. Father Justin Monaghan was in his quarters behind the church watching a golf tournament on television when the storm hit. He took shelter in his bathroom as the church and rectory were leveled. ""I was praying at a high speed,"" said the priest, known to his parishioners as Father Justin. ""I didn't expect from the noise coming at me that I was going to survive in any manner. I certainly was praying, and I was just praying to ask God to accept his will."" Monaghan moved to the United States in the 1960s, but he still speaks with a lilting Irish brogue. He has been the pastor of St. Mary's for 12 years and has seen storms come and go, but nothing like the magnitude of last year's tornado. When he emerged from the rubble, he saw that one of the few things still standing was the cross. ""I just looked and I thought, God is really with us, and he's letting us know he's going to take care of us,"" he said. ""It was tremendous. It was a real gift to see that and it became a symbol all over the community, in fact all over the world."" His flock has been attending services at a neighboring church while construction begins a few miles away on the new St. Mary's. The location of the old church will be the site of an electrical substation, but the cross will remain and become part of a small park. iReporters share their experiences from Joplin . Monaghan said he still visits the cross many mornings to pray and meditate at dawn. ""Your God is alive and well. And we don't always know why these things happen, but thanks for giving us a message of unity,"" he prays. The cross sits on high ground overlooking the mixed recovery in Joplin. Nearby Cunningham Park now holds a beautiful fountain and memorial to those lost in the tornado, along with basketball courts and playgrounds. Across the street from the park is the wreckage of St. John's Regional Medical Center, which still looks much the way it did in the days immediately after the storm, with blown-out windows and collapsed walls. Demolition is under way on the heavily damaged hospital, but it is the tallest building in the area, making it impossible to forget the epic destruction the tornado brought. A new hospital is being built on a site a few miles away. About a mile west of St. Mary's, the tornado hit Joplin High School, which is now a massive pile of rubble behind a chain link fence. The school district canceled the remainder of the 2011 school year and set to work trying to figure out what to do with its students when summer was over. School officials settled on a unique solution: They would construct a temporary school in the vacant end of a shopping mall and use it for several years until a new school could be built. After a frantic summer of planning and building, they managed to open the makeshift school on time in September 2011. Read Joplin student's blog post . It took the students and teachers awhile to get used to having classes in a mall, watching senior citizen mall walkers pass by the cafeteria doors during lunch. Now, as the seniors get ready for graduation, it feels like a real school. There is an uncommon maturity to the students at Joplin High School. Two students from the school died, many others lost their homes, and all are part of a battered and bruised community. ""We get support from each other and our teachers,"" explained Rachel Berryhill, an 18-year-old senior. ""And it just helps us grow stronger and stronger, so I think it's good we're here together."" The tornado destroyed her family's home, along with all her possessions, including clothes and jewelry. ""I know it's changed me a lot as a person whether I like it or not,"" she said. ""I don't care as much about material possessions. Now it's like, whatever, and it's made me value friendships."" She is excited to have President Obama speak at her graduation and, like many in Joplin, she doesn't dwell on what happened here. But, she says, when a storm approaches it's hard to forget. To ease students' minds and protect them in the event of another tornado, the school has erected concrete storm shelters in the parking lot. Each student is assigned a shelter and the school holds regular drills to be sure they can evacuate in a matter of minutes. Many Joplin residents struggle with the fear of another devastating storm striking the town. Judy Lowe lost everything in last year's tornado, salvaging only a few photos of her sons after seeing them posted on Facebook. Today, she keeps them in a concrete-reinforced closet with a steel door. ""This is just like having a lock box, and I know that I'm not going to lose these photos again,"" she said. ""I can replace anything that I can go to a store and buy, but I can never replace any of these things."" Lowe now lives in a brand-new house full of newly purchased furniture. Her neighborhood is only partly rebuilt and backhoes are as common on the streets as cars. Work keeps her busy. She tries to not dwell on the tornado and all that she and her family have been through, but like Rachel Berryhill, she gets nervous when a storm rolls in. ""I get tense, edgy, just kind of anxious,"" she said. ""There's always going to be that fear of it happening again, and my biggest struggle is trying to not show fear for my children."" She is eager for the anniversary to come and go and for the rebuilding to be complete. ""I'm proud of Joplin. We have a long way to go,"" she said. ""Seeing it every day you just want it over, want it done, want it fixed. Unfortunately we're not there yet, but we will be.""","On May 22, 2011, a powerful tornado destroyed about a third of Joplin, Missouri .

"Beijing (CNN) -- For the first time, urban dwellers in China now outnumber those living in the country. At the end of 2011, China counted 690.79 million urban dwellers, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said Tuesday. That marks an increase of 21 million over the previous year and accounts for 51.27% of the country's 1.347 billion people. During the same period, the rural population shrunk by 14.56 million to 656.56 million. The number of people between the ages of 15 and 64 stood at about 1 billion, or 74.4% of the total population, the NBS added. China's breakneck economic growth over the past three decades has seen an explosion in the size of China's cities and towns, especially along its prosperous east coast. China's economic growth slowing? Spurred by Deng Xiaoping's reform policies of the 1970s, which were aimed at modernizing an economy that had been dominated by agriculture, millions of Chinese farmers have been on the move, a massive internal migration that has changed the face of China. Many of these migrant workers, known as ""mingong,"" have left the countryside for the cities looking for better-paid jobs in areas such as manufacturing. Mega-cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, have been at the heart of this change, serving as the engines of China's rapid economic transformation. ""Urbanization is an irreversible process and in the next 20 years, China's urban population will reach 75% of the total population,"" said Li Jianmin, head of the Institute of Population and Development Research at Nankai University, in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse. ""This will have a huge impact on China's environment, and on social and economic development."" There are at least 200 million migrant workers in the whole country, according to a national census carried out in April last year. Many are seasonal workers who work in cities part-time and then return to their villages -- though an increasing number live and work in urban centers permanently. However, it is difficult for many rural migrants working in cities to become fully-fledged urban residents, due to a centuries-old household registration system known as ""hukou,"" which categorizes the population into rural and urban residents. Without an urban hukou permit, a migrant is often denied access to the subsidized health, housing and education for children that city dwellers enjoy.","2011: China counted 690.79 million urban dwellers, 656.56 million in rural areas .

"(CNN) -- The body of a crime reporter who had been abducted Thursday in northwest Sonora State was found Friday inside a plastic bag south of Sonora, Notimex reported. Marco Antonio Avila Garcia's body, which bore signs of torture and carried a message related to drug trafficking, was discovered south of the municipality of Guyamas, the state-run news agency said, citing Jose Larrinaga, a spokesman for the district attorney. Avila Garcia, 39, covered the public security beat for the daily El Regional de Sonora and Diario de Sonora in the municipality of Cajeme. Three armed, hooded men had kidnapped him from a carwash, Larrinaga said. The National Human Rights Commission condemned the killing. Commission President Raul Plascencia Villanueva called for an official investigation and that those responsible be punished ""and sent a clear message that there will be no tolerance for those who commit crimes against journalists."" The Committee to Protect Journalists said it had tallied more than 45 journalists who have been killed or disappeared in Mexico since 2006. ""We call on the Mexican authorities to do everything in their power to locate Marcos Avila Garcia and bring him back to safety,"" said Joel Simon, CPJ's executive director. Early this month, the dismembered bodies of two newspaper photographers, the girlfriend of one of them and a retired newspaper photographer were found inside plastic bags in Mexico's eastern state of Veracruz. In its report on a survey of political rights and civil liberties, ""Freedom of the Press 2012,"" Freedom House described Mexico as ""not free.""","Marco Antonio Avila Garcia, 39, had been abducted Thursday from a car wash .

"(CNN) -- She's a veteran reality television star, not to mention an author, entrepreneur, wife and mother. Kendra Wilkinson's life in the limelight demands that she travel by plane about five times a month. She can handle fame, but flying terrifies her. ""I cannot stand it,"" she says. When she flies, Wilkinson, whose reality show, ""Kendra on Top,"" debuted this month on WE tv, turns to her fellow passengers to help her cope. ""Every time I fly, I grab on to the person next to me,"" she says. ""People pray with me."" The airline staff members she encounters are especially empathetic. ""The flight attendants give me ice packs."" Millions share Wilkinson's anxiety, and the fear can be debilitating. Many turn to professional therapy. Others try to resolve their fears themselves; some have more success than others. Experts caution that it's hard to pin down a precise number of people who suffer from a fear of flying, without a recent comprehensive survey. Also, many are reluctant to share details of their phobia -- or how disruptive it can be. Wilkinson, who rose to fame as one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends on the reality show ""The Girls Next Door,"" turns to the cocktail cart to calm her nerves. ""I do try to have a glass of wine. Wine helps me cool down a little bit,"" she says. ""Or two glasses of wine."" Pinot grigio aside, she also tries to picture calming images. ""I try my hardest to close my eyes and picture my son,"" she says. ""I think of my happiest moments."" Wilkinson, who hasn't received formal treatment, aspires to fly with her 2Â½-year-old son without scaring him with her unconcealed fear. Reason doesn't always conquer fear . John DiScala was terrified to fly. From his late teens until his early 20s, he rarely left his home in Connecticut. Now, he visits more than 20 countries a year -- by plane -- and runs the travel blog JohnnyJet.com. But his runway toward recovery was a long one. His terror set in when he was 17. Waiting with his parents to board a flight from New York, bound for Australia, he had an anxiety attack at the airport. ""I felt this tingling all over my body,"" he says. ""I felt like I was not in control."" The year before, his doctor had diagnosed him with asthma. He had also suggested that the cabin pressure on the flight could give him respiratory problems. ""It kept running through my head what the doctor said,"" DiScala remembers: "" 'You will have trouble breathing.' "" He missed that trip to Perth, where he would have visited his sisters -- and didn't travel again for more than three years. ""I was basically afraid to leave the house,"" he says. ""I was full of fear."" This unchecked terror arises despite statistics that show how safe flying is. Less than 1% of total transportation fatalities in the U.S. were the result of air accidents in the most recent figures from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. But numbers don't necessarily calm nerves. And a fear of air travel isn't always rational. ""It doesn't have to do with how safe flying is,"" says Tom Bunn, the president and founder of the SOAR program. He counsels fearful fliers with a mix of one-on-one therapy and education about how airplanes work. He says his clients, who hail from a wide range of backgrounds and professions, try to talk themselves out of their fear but fail. ""Oftentimes, they struggle tremendously on their own to fix it, and find they can't,"" he says. Many turn to therapy when their fear starts to disrupt their lives as well as their livelihoods. Phobia interferes with work . Patty McLoughlin, 53, is a sales representative in the gift industry. She needs to travel to meetings at least twice a year. Based in Columbus, Ohio, she would regularly drive 12 hours just to avoid a flight. She hadn't flown in 16 years. ""For pleasure, I could work around it,"" she says. ""Not with business."" But when a West Coast meeting came up at a new job, she realized she had to conquer her fear. ""It was difficult to drive to California,"" she says. It was impractical as well. She realized that her fear was getting in the way, and flying to meetings would help her make the most of her new job. ""If I wanted to grow within the company, I knew I'd have to overcome it,"" she says. And she did, with the help of a SOAR course. There are people who buy plane tickets but are too scared to use them. ""We hear from people who want to go someplace special, and they can't go,"" says Alies Muskin, executive director of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. ""They just don't do it."" Karina Slota of Maryland, 39, was supposed to be maid of honor at her sister's wedding in Bermuda 10 years ago. Her entire family traveled to the event, including her 80-year-old grandmother, who had flown over from Germany. Slota boarded the flight from Maryland to Bermuda but didn't make it to takeoff. ""If I stay on this plane, I am going to die,"" she thought. While the plane was still at the gate, flight attendants had to open the plane door to let Slota off. She calls the experience humiliating. ""I was crying,"" she says. ""I felt like I was being judged."" She missed the wedding, and for 10 years, she didn't fly. Finally, Slota took a course with SOAR. Although she still gets anxious ahead of a trip, she says she manages to stay calm on the flight itself. She uses the mental exercises she learned from the program's videos, such as focusing on her surroundings, to stay calm and now flies about once a year. More treatment available . Some travelers are afraid to travel by plane without letting that fear interfere with their lives. They might grip their armrests tightly during takeoff, say a prayer before they board or take anti-anxiety medication. And when a flight gets bumpy, almost anyone can get scared, even frequent fliers. ""I really don't like turbulence,"" says Liz Borod Wright, editor of the travel blog Travelogged. But she doesn't let that stop her from traveling overseas. Driving isn't a realistic option when holiday plans include Europe. ""I'm not going to let my fear of flying prevent me from flying."" Fear of flying ""doesn't discriminate,"" says Josh Spitalnick, director of Research and Clinical Services at the Virtually Better clinic in Atlanta. He says some of his clinic's clients became wary after unpleasant flights, sometimes involving severe turbulence. Others just anticipate a rocky ride. ""Through treatment, we teach people relaxation skills to better allow them to cope,"" Spitalnick says. His clinic uses virtual reality technology to simulate a flight. It also uses data and statistics to teach nervous fliers that thousands of flights take off successfully every day. A wide range of treatments are available for people with flying fears. So whether a person hasn't flown in decades or just gets anxious during turbulent flights, he or she should be able to find the right remedy. ""Over the last 30 years, there have been a lot of treatments that have been developed, and refined,"" Muskin says. ""Thirty years ago, there were no treatments at all."" Every person's anxiety takes a different form, so their solutions do, too. ""No two individuals are treated the same way,"" she says. With the range of remedies, people with flying phobias have a higher chance of curing their fears. ""People have a lot of success,"" she says. ""We know that they can get better."" Conquering a fear of flying comes at a cost: Sessions can cost hundreds of dollars, and most patients need more than one. But for many, the cost of living with the phobia and missing important personal and professional obligations can be higher than the price of curing it. For DiScala, the thrill of traveling helped him overcome his fear. ""I almost think travel is a drug,"" he says. ""I love to explore new places."" Are you afraid to fly? Have you overcome a fear a flying? How did you do it? Share your experiences below.","Kendra Wilkinson travels by plane five times a month and hates to fly .

"(CNN) -- Lane Kommer should be skiing this week. Instead he postponed a trip to Colorado because the snow situation just isn't looking good. ""We've been keeping a close eye on the weather the last few weeks and keeping our fingers crossed, hoping for some good snow and it just got to the point where we decided it's better to reschedule and pay to change our plans than to go out there and be disappointed,"" said Kommer, who was planning to fly from Dallas to meet up with friends at Beaver Creek Resort. Now they're planning to go in February. It is a decision faced by skiers and snowboarders across the United States as ski resorts scramble to make the snow that Mother Nature isn't providing. December 2011 yielded the 11th least extensive snow cover in the United States in the past 46 years, according to climatologist David Robinson, a professor in the geography department at Rutgers University. Weather patterns are moving in and out too quickly and nothing is locking in to produce significant snowfall, he said. ""It doesn't look like there's going to be huge improvement the next two weeks and we're getting halfway through winter by then. But still, hope springs eternal for late January into early March. One would expect that we're going to see at least some interruption in this progressive fast-moving pattern,"" Robinson said. Any snow would be a welcome change for the Lake Tahoe area straddling California and Nevada, where odd spring-like weather has plagued snow seekers. Base snow averaged about 14 inches at seven area resorts on Thursday, with summit averages of a little more than 19 inches. The annual average summit snowfall at one of the resorts is 350 inches. Revenue at some California resorts over the peak week between Christmas and New Year's was down 20% to 30% after a tremendous ski season across the United States last year, according to estimates from the National Ski Areas Association. It's no good for skiers, but the warm weather is pleasant, said local restaurant manager Vicky Mallett. ""It's just gorgeous. People are paddle-boarding and hiking and riding their bikes, so they're definitely in town hanging out,"" said Mallett, who manages the Fire Sign CafÃ© in Tahoe City, California. Lack of the cold white stuff actually brought a boost to the cafÃ©'s business in the past few weeks, she said. ""We're really busy because (visitors are) not skiing."" People who would usually be on the trails all day are skiing in the morning and then coming into town, Mallett said, but she suspects the novelty of the warm weather will wear off for vacationers. Ski resorts in other parts of the West didn't experience such steep declines in December business. In Colorado and Utah, revenue was down by single digit percentages over the holiday week, said Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association. Holiday bookings at major destination resorts are usually made before the start of the season. With the lack of snow going into January, some potential customers are hanging back to see what happens, Berry said. ""We are a weather-dependent industry, no matter what, and we've done lots of things to help mitigate it, but at the end of the day, it's always nice to have Mother Nature's help,"" he said. Some of Colorado's biggest resorts -- like Aspen and Vail -- are surviving on high altitude, cold temperatures and enough money to produce a lot of man-made snow, said Patrick Crawford, content director of snow sports website OnTheSnow. Ski areas are trying to make the best of it. Aspen/Snowmass CEO Mike Kaplan penned a blog post this week titled ""The Glass is Half Full"" highlighting some of the best trail conditions, and a Facebook comment complaining about attractive photos of ""fake snow"" on the resort's page received this upbeat response: ""Yep - sometimes we've got to lend a hand when Mother Nature is being fickle. Sure beats doing nothing, right?"" Vail Resorts, which owns six resorts in Colorado and California, is looking at a .6% increase in total lift ticket revenue from the start of the season in November through the beginning of January over the same period last year, according to CEO Rob Katz. Katz said that slight uptick after last year's incredible season is due in large part to the company's investment in snowmaking and family-friendly activities and amenities. So while a lot of expert terrain is closed, the intermediate terrain is available to vacationing families. ""For an expert skier who wants to ski everything, no question, they come and they say 'hey, this isn't as good as it was last year,' absolutely,"" Katz said. Despite a very slow start to the ski season, there are a few brighter spots, Crawford said. Western storm systems have split to the far north and south of the country, so conditions in New Mexico, Arizona and southern Colorado in the south and the Pacific Northwest, Alaska and Canada are looking pretty good. ""We can't complain certainly,"" said Kathleen Goyette, a spokeswoman for Ski Washington. Resorts in Washington got 20 to 35 inches of fresh snow during the last week of December. The state's resorts are aware of their luck compared with many other areas of the country, she said. ""We've been there before,"" Goyette said. ""We've been the ones with no snow."" Not so compassionate is Big Sky Resort in Montana, which is taking a run at Vail Resorts' business with an offer of free lift tickets to holders of the company's Epic Pass, which allows unlimited access to all six Vail-owned resorts in Colorado and California. Epic Pass holders must book lodging through Big Sky to be eligible for free skiing. Still, there's no bounty of deals, and the OnTheSnow user community isn't happy paying full price for poor conditions, Crawford said. ""Considering the state of the snow, you don't see as many discounts as you think you might. But this is also when (resorts) make all their money."" Things have ""turned the corner"" at ski areas east of the Mississippi after a 10% to 15% slump in holiday week revenue, said Berry of the National Ski Areas Association. There has been some natural snow in some areas this week and colder temperatures mean resorts are ""making snow like crazy."" People in the ski business have their fingers crossed for recovery across the country. Lack of snow affects livelihoods as well as vacation plans. ""It's a big big deal for our little industry,"" Crawford said.","Ski resorts have suffered from dry weather and warm temperatures .
Base snow averaged about 14 inches this week at Lake Tahoe resorts .
Bright spots include New Mexico, the Pacific Northwest and Alaska ."
"Washington (CNN) -- A federal court panel in Washington Wednesday ruled in favor of South Carolina's voter photo ID law, but said it cannot go into effect until next year because there's too little time to implement the new law for this November's election. The three-judge panel said South Carolina's law does not discriminate against racial minorities as the Justice Department and other opponents had argued. The ruling further clouds the issue, which has resulted in conflicting rulings on whether requiring voters to present an identification card bearing the person's photograph is discriminatory. In ""pre-clearing key sections of the South Carolina statute, the judges compared the law with those of other states, including Texas, where a federal court panel rejected a photo ID requirement for voting,"" wrote the opinion's author, D.C. Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Latino voter registration efforts running out of time in Pennsylvania . ""In sum, our comparison of South Carolina's act to some other states' voter ID laws ... strongly buttresses the conclusion that South Carolina's law has neither a discriminatory effect nor a discriminatory purpose,"" he wrote. Circuit judges John Bates and Colleen Kollar-Kotelly joined with concurring opinions. The judges said the new law would require voters to be informed of and educated about the law's requirements, which would not be possible before the November 6 elections. Therefore, the panel rejected trying to implement the provisions for the upcoming balloting. The judges noted that about 95% of South Carolina registered voters possess the approved photo IDs. That includes 96% of whites and 92% to 94% of African-American voters. Despite the disparity, the court found that state election officials had included a ""sweeping reasonable impediment provision"" that eliminates any disproportionate effect or material burden on voters. The judges took note of the requirement in the Texas law, which has been blocked in court, requiring many citizens to get a birth certificate that costs $22. And in Texas, unlike South Carolina, many counties lack a place for voters to obtain qualifying photo identification cards. The court found no comparable issues in the South Carolina law. The Justice Department, although on the losing end of the ruling, issued a statement expressing satisfaction with much of the opinion. Judge blocks Pennsylvania voter ID law for November election . ""The Department of Justice is pleased that the court has denied ""preclearance"" of the South Carolina law for the 2012 elections,"" said Justice Department civil rights spokeswoman Dena Iverson. ""With regard to future elections, the department welcomes the court's agreement that South Carolina's law required broad modifications in order to respond to the serious concerns raised by the attorney general that the law as written would exclude minority voters."" South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson declared victory in the case, calling the ruling ""a major victory for South Carolina and its election process.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Air Force began grounding a third of its fighter jet fleet on Tuesday because of forced spending cuts, one of the most prominent consequences so far of government-wide austerity that began in March. Dozens of units in the United States, Europe and the Pacific ultimately will stand down, according to a statement from Gen. Mike Hostage, the commander of the Air Force's Air Combat Command. The move involving jets assigned to fighter, bomber, airborne warning and other squads aims to ensure that remaining units can maintain sufficient readiness through the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends September 30. The cuts impact operations and maintenance, which must be implemented in part by flying approximately 45,000 fewer training hours through that period. Budget cuts ground Blue Angels, Thunderbirds . ""We must implement a tiered readiness concept where only the units preparing to deploy in support of major operations like Afghanistan are fully mission capable. Units will stand down on a rotating basis so our limited resources can be focused on fulfilling critical missions,"" Hostage said. ""The current situation means we're accepting the risk that combat air power may not be ready to respond immediately to new contingencies as they occur,"" he said. The Pentagon is expected to absorb about half of the $85 billion in sweeping budget cuts, called sequester, that resulted from the inability of Congress to reach a deal on deficit reduction. The Defense Department had warned the cuts could threaten readiness. It is also expected to furlough civilian employees and cut contracts to meet the budget target. Separately, the Navy on Tuesday announced it was canceling all the air shows its Blue Angels Flight Demonstration Squadron had scheduled for the rest of the year. The Navy action follows the Air Force's April 1 announcement that its Thunderbirds team would not perform again this year. Some units currently deployed, including A-10s, B-1s, F-16s and F-22s, will stand down after they return from their deployments. Others were grounded on Tuesday. The action will also impact certain Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard A-10 and F-16 squadrons. ""We're entering uncharted territory in terms of how we've had to take this year's cuts and make adjustments to mitigate the most serious impacts,"" Hostage said. ""Remaining as mission-ready as possible for combatant commanders is our priority, and we're prioritizing spending to ensure this imperative is met."" Units that stop flying will shift their emphasis to ground training. They will use flight simulators to the extent possible within existing contracts, and conduct academic training to maintain basic skills and knowledge of their aircraft.

"(CNN) -- It has been nearly four weeks since Italians went to the polls and the country is still drifting rudderless without a functioning government. This week, political leaders are holding two days of crucial talks with Italy's ceremonial president of the republic, Giorgio Napolitano. The talks began Wednesday morning and are expected to conclude at 6 p.m. Thursday in Rome. Italy's February elections were inconclusive, and have created a political gridlock that is hobbling the country's economy. The nation is currently in its longest recession in 20 years. It's economy -- Europe's third-largest with a government debt the Treasury Ministry puts at $2.6 trillion -- shrank by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, Eurobarometer says. After the elections failed to produce a government, international ratings agency Fitch downgraded Italy's credit rating from A- to BBB+ and warned of further risks if political uncertainty continues and reforms and austerity measures are stalled by a lack of a functioning government. Italy's hung parliament met for the first time on Friday, when ministers began the process of electing leaders of the lower house and the Senate. Laura Boldrini, 51, a former journalist and spokeswoman for the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, won a strong majority as the speaker of the lower house. Piero Grasso, 68, an anti-mafia magistrate from Sicily, became the speaker of the Senate. At a news conference Tuesday, Boldrini and Grasso pledged to push through legislation that would cut salaries and benefits for members of parliament by 30%. Italian lawmakers are among the highest paid in all of Europe, according to a Eurobarometer poll in 2011. ""We are asking for the same kinds of sacrifices to our pay that Italians are suffering through the recession,"" Boldrini told CNN by telephone. But Italy is still lacking a functioning prime minister. None of the country's top leading parties currently has enough support to lead the country single-handedly, and none of the leaders have so far showed a willingness to form a grand coalition or support each other's candidates for the prime ministerial role. Napolitano said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon that during this week's talks he will first attempt to persuade leaders to support Pierluigi Bersani of the center-left Partito Democratico as prime minister. Bersani fared the best in the February elections by leading a leftist coalition to a small majority in the lower house of parliament. But he was unable to win a majority in the Senate, where it counts. Instead, power in the Senate was divided between Bersani and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's center-right coalition, anchored by his party, Popolo della Liberta, or People of Freedom. Bersani and Berlusconi are arch-rivals who have indicated they will not work together. Bersani's platform included judicial reforms that reverse legislation passed when Berlusconi held office, including expanding statutes of limitations on financial crimes and stripping political leaders of immunity. Berlusconi is currently awaiting a verdict in a trial in which he stands accused of paying an underage prostitute for sex on more than 13 occasions and abusing his office to protect her in an unrelated crime. The verdict is expected to come in early April. Last year, Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud. Last month, he was convicted of publishing illegally acquired wiretaps in his brother's newspaper. He is appealing both convictions. Berlusconi has indicated that he does not agree with Bersani's judicial and criminal reforms and that he would not work with the center-left as long as those items are on the agenda. The election deadlock has meant that Beppe Grillo, a former comedian and political revolutionary who led his grass-roots Five-Star Movement to third-place in the elections by promising to get rid of Italy's tired politicians and traditional political parties, would be the key to power if he were to support one of the traditional parties. But since the elections, he has refused to work with either Bersani or Berlusconi, resulting in the political gridlock. He has said no to a political or technocratic government, leaving little room to negotiate. Grillo, continuing to rebuff Bersani's attempts to work together to form a coalition, Friday called Bersani ""dead man talking."" But his own party is showing some fractures. A dozen of its members in parliament voted against the party's candidates in the elections last weekend to choose the parliamentary leaders. Grillo, who is not a member of parliament and did not run for office, lambasted his unfaithful party members on his personal blog. Mario Monti, who led Italy in a technocratic role after Berlusconi resigned under pressure in November 2011, did not win enough support in the February elections to bolster either side, and his austerity platform is not seen as a draw for support. He has been acting as prime minister since the election produced no winner, but he threatened to walk off the job last weekend during the debate over electing the parliamentary leaders. Saturday, Napolitano asked Monti to stay on in his caretaker role until a government can be formed. ""It is important for Europe, and to exercise whatever initiatives are possible and necessary, especially for the economy and jobs, the government remains under the authoritative leadership of Mario Monti until a new government is formed,"" Napolitano said in a written statement. Napolitano's intervention meetings on Wednesday and Thursday will either confirm Bersani as a prime minister or produce a technocratic leader who will guide the country forward to inevitable early elections, likely either in June or next autumn. To further complicate matters, Napolitano's mandate as president ends on May 15. In accordance with Italy's electoral law, the president cannot dissolve parliament or call new elections with less than six months left in office. That means that either with or without a prime minister, Italy's hung parliament must begin the process of electing a new president to replace Napolitano. That process will start on April 15 with the nomination of candidates, a step subject to a fair amount of backroom horse-trading. Berlusconi recently said in an interview on his Mediaset television network that he would consider agreeing to Bersani as prime minister if his center-right ally, Gianni Letta, were elected president of the Republic. Other presidential candidate names mentioned by members of parliament in interviews with the Italian press include Monti and respected Radical Party leader and former European Union Member of Parliament Emma Bonino.","Talks led by President Giorgio Napolitano begin Wednesday in an effort to forge a government .

"(CNN) -- The oldest-known hominid skeleton was a 4-foot-tall female who walked upright more than 4 million years ago and offers new clues to how humans may have evolved, scientists say. This sketch shows what a 4 million-year-old hominid, nicknamed Ardi, may have looked like. Scientists believe that the fossilized remains, which were discovered in 1994 in Ethiopia and studied for years by an international team of researchers, support beliefs that humans and chimpanzees evolved separately from a common ancestor. ""This is not an ordinary fossil. It's not a chimp. It's not a human. It shows us what we used to be,"" said project co-director Tim White, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Ardipithecus ramidus, nicknamed ""Ardi,"" is a hominid species that lived 4.4 million years ago in what is now Aramis, Ethiopia. That makes Ardi more than a million years older than the celebrated Lucy, the partial ape-human skeleton found in Africa in 1974. Ardi's 125-piece skeleton includes the skull, teeth, pelvis, hands and feet bones. Scientists say the data collected from Ardi's bone fragments over the past 17 years push back the story of human evolution further than previously believed. ""In fact, what Ardipithecus tells us is that we as humans have been evolving to what we are today for at least 6 million years,"" C. Owen Lovejoy, an evolutionary biologist at Kent State University and project anatomist, said Thursday. Analysis of Ardi's skeleton reveals that she weighed about 110 pounds, had very long arms and fingers, and possessed an opposable big toe that would have helped her grasp branches while moving through trees. Ardi's brain was believed to be the size of a chimp's, but she also had many human-like features, such as the ability to walk upright on two legs. Her ""all-purpose type"" teeth indicate that she probably ate a combination of plants, fruits and small mammals, scientists say. ""The anatomy behind this behavioral combination is very unexpected and is certain to cause considerable rethinking of not only our evolutionary past, but also that of our living relatives: the great apes,"" said Alan Walker, professor of biological anthropology at Pennsylvania State University. Many scientists hypothesize that humans took a different evolutionary trajectory from those of chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas. Ardi's findings help challenge earlier beliefs that humans evolved from chimpanzees, their closest genetic relatives, scientists say. Researchers are still trying to pinpoint when the two lineages -- chimps and humans -- split from their common ancestor. Digging up the past has not been easy. Scientists stumbled upon the Ardipithecus fossil in 1994 when a graduate student found a single upper molar tooth. The rest of Ardi's fossilized bones, sandwiched between layers of volcanic rock, took three years to be recovered and many more to be analyzed. ""In many ways, the discovery of Ardipithecus has been like a marathon,"" White said. ""Ardipithecus ramidus and its prevailing anatomy revolutionize the way most of us understood the earlier part of our evolutionary history,"" said team member Yohannes Haile-Selassie, paleontologist at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. The Ardi findings are the work of 47 paleontologists and geologists representing 10 countries. The results will be published Friday in 11 articles in a special edition of the journal Science. Until now, Australopithecus, nicknamed ""Lucy,"" was the oldest fossil studied by scientists seeking to explain human evolution. Lucy is believed to have lived about 3.2 million years ago in what is now Ethiopia. Many scientists credit Ethiopia with taking the lead in helping the world better understand the origins of humans. ""This finding points to a deeper sense of our [humans'] interconnectedness,"" Samuel Assefa, Ethiopian ambassador to the United States, said Thursday. ""We are all Ethiopians at heart."" Ardi's skeleton resides in the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa.","Researchers have unveiled a 4.4 million-year-old skeleton of a hominid female .

"(CNN) -- Four Nigerian farmers and the environmental group Friends of the Earth took oil giant Shell to court Thursday in the Netherlands to demand a proper cleanup and compensation for pollution in the Niger Delta. The farmers want the Anglo-Dutch multinational to ""clean up the oil pollution in their fields and fishponds"" and make sure their pipelines are maintained and kept secure to prevent leaks in the future. The civil case has been filed against the Nigerian subsidiary of Shell, the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), and its international headquarters in the Netherlands, Royal Dutch Shell. Read more: Ice floe forces Shell to call off Arctic drilling . Based on ""years of oil pollution in three villages in the Niger Delta,"" it could have ""major legal consequences internationally,"" the Dutch branch of Friends of the Earth, known locally as Milieudefensie, said in a statement ahead of the first hearing. The three villages concerned are Goi, hit by a spill in 2004, Oruma, affected by a spill a year later, and Ikot Ada Udo, hit by various spills in 2007, according to Friends of the Earth. Shell argues that it has cleaned up the spills to the satisfaction of the Nigerian authorities, and has no case to answer. But Friends of the Earth says that oil pollution has had a devastating and continuing impact on vegetation, water supplies and local fishing ponds. The campaign group says this is the first time a Dutch company has been brought before a court in the Netherlands over environmental damage caused abroad. ""It is also the first time that the headquarters of a multinational concern on the European continent has been summoned to appear in court for environmental or human rights violations in a developing country,"" it said. Shell insists it is ""committed to cleaning up all spills from its facilities"" and blames saboteurs who steal oil from its pipelines for much of the environmental damage. Read more: Could it finally be springtime for Nigeria? ""The real tragedy of the Niger Delta is the widespread and continual criminal activity, including sabotage, theft and illegal refining, that causes the vast majority of oil spills,"" Shell spokesman Jonathan French said in a statement Thursday. ""It is this criminality which all organizations with an interest in Nigeria's future should focus their efforts on highlighting and addressing."" French said that Shell had cleaned up three leaks at three locations, from 2004 to 2007, which were caused by sabotage. Under Nigerian law, oil companies are not liable to pay compensation for damage caused by sabotage spills, he said. The court is expected to hear from both sides in the case Thursday and will probably deliver a verdict late this year or early in 2013, Friends of the Earth said. ""Hopefully, the legal route that Milieudefensie has chosen will ensure not only that four people in the Niger Delta have a better life but also increase the opportunity for thousands of their fellow citizens and millions of people worldwide who now often are without rights against powerful and sometimes unscrupulous multinationals,"" campaign coordinator Geert Ritsema said. The argument over the impact of oil production in the Niger Delta, which includes the Ogoniland region, is a long-running one. The world's third largest wetland, the Niger Delta is diverse and rich with mangroves and fish-rich waterways. But oil drilling has turned it into one of the most oil-polluted places on Earth, with more than 6,800 recorded oil spills, accounting for anywhere from 9 million to 13 million barrels of oil spilled, according to activist groups. Read more: Chevron facing $18B judgment in Ecuador . Many residents make their livelihoods from fishing and depend on the polluted mangroves and creeks. A report by the U.N. Environmental Program last year found that pollution from more than 50 years of oil operations in the Ogoniland region, by Shell and other companies, was more far-reaching than thought. The assessment, commissioned by the Nigerian government and funded by Shell, concluded that restoration of the area could take up to 30 years, cost $1 billion and become the largest cleanup operation in history. ""Control and maintenance of oilfield infrastructure in Ogoniland has been and remains inadequate: the Shell Petroleum Development Company's own procedures have not been applied, creating public health and safety issues,"" the report found. Shell has previously accepted responsibility for two oil spills in Ogoniland in 2008 and 2009. CNN's Alexander Felton contributed to this report.","The case was brought by four Nigerian farmers and the Dutch Friends of the Earth .

"(CNN) -- Get off the grid and into the wild on an overnight backpacking trip. Backpackers are likely to experience the wilderness much more intimately than other types of travelers -- and reap the benefits of physical exercise and mental refreshment at the same time. ""A variety of studies show that even relatively brief experiences in nature can enhance feelings of energy and vitality,"" said Dr. Richard M. Ryan, professor of psychology, psychiatry and education at the University of Rochester. Nature has a way of magnifying little details you may have overlooked, and your safety and overall enjoyment depend on your preparedness. So if you're not sure where to begin your backpacking adventure, consider a guided trip. 7 prime spots for wildlife viewing . Trip outfitters will often supply you with all the gear you need, including food. And guided getaways are not just for beginners. Seasoned backpackers often opt for guided trips too, says Ian Elman, owner of Southern Yosemite Mountain Guides, a company that specializes in these types of excursions. Many guides will customize trips to suit your specific needs and physical condition. Guided trip costs can range from less than $200 per person to thousands of dollars depending on the nature and length of your trip. Starting locally is a great way to gauge your interest and skill level for future expeditions. 12 things you might not have known about the Appalachian Trail . Ready for some adventure? These five immense U.S. national parks offer backpacking trips of a lifetime: . Grand Canyon National Park . The Grand Canyon in Arizona offers some of the most challenging backpacking in the United States due to its steep trails and fast-changing weather conditions. If you opt to hike from the North Rim to the South Rim, you'll experience an elevation differential of more than 10,000 feet from start to finish, according to the National Park Service. The reward? Getting a unique perspective on the natural wonder and its geological rainbow from the base of the canyon. Are you a window flier or an aisle seater? A popular itinerary for first-time backpackers is to spend a few nights at either Bright Angel or Indian Garden Campgrounds. These sites can be accessed by the Bright Angel Trail, and you'll need a park service backcountry permit. The National Park Service maintains a list of companies authorized to guide backpackers within the park. Glacier National Park . Glacier National Park in Montana ranks as one of the most popular backpacking parks, according to the National Park Service. Its alpine lakes, steep mountains, abundant wildlife and more than 700 miles of trails make this park a backpacker's dream. Belly River Trail is a popular route. This 13.6 mile trail offers spectacular mountainous scenery and passes by campgrounds at Elizabeth Lake and Helen Lake. The trail drops 740 feet in the first few miles then levels out. Backcountry campers will need a permit. Glacier Guides is the park-service approved outfit for guided and custom backpacking trips into the park's backcountry. Yellowstone National Park . Yellowstone is one of the most diverse national parks, with landscapes ranging from forested mountain slopes to valleys bustling with wildlife to roaring rivers. Some 1,000 miles of trails criss-cross the park, some offering easy trips over gentle terrain, while others require technical skills and endurance. The park service says many of Yellowstone's trails are more than 7,000 feet above sea level and most areas have snow until late May or early June. The park service suggests avoiding high elevations early in the season because some of these areas may be closed if conditions are considered unsafe for visitors. A list of outfitters permitted to guide backpackers within Yellowstone can be viewed on the park's official website. Denali National Park and Preserve . Denali, in Alaska's interior, encompasses more than 6 million acres of land and is home to North America's tallest peak at 20,320 feet -- Mount McKinley. Black bears and grizzly bears are among the stars for wildlife spotters (just keep your distance). This national park is about the size of Vermont, yet only a handful of trails exist in this vast, solitary area. Most of the trails are within three miles of the park entrance, but if you're adventurous, you can explore the wild terrain, which ranges from a low-elevation taiga forest to snow-covered mountains. You'll need to get a backcountry permit in person before you set out. Three park-authorized companies offer guided backpacking: Alaska Mountaineering School, Mountain Trip and Rigging for Rescue. North Cascades National Park . Escape to this national park in Washington state and surround yourself with mountains, glaciers and streams. Grizzly bears are among the 75 mammal species that inhabit the wilderness. Backpacking is popular at North Cascades and trips can range from an overnight on relatively level land to multiday hikes over multiple mountain passes. Mountaineering treks for varying skill levels are an option, too, but this is not a beginner's venture. Beaver Loop trail is a moderate, forested route. The 34.2 mile journey offers a side trip with views of Challenger glacier and peak and usually takes three to four days.

"(CNN) -- If you can pay for your bills online; why not pay for your sins? ""I'm not in a drive-through business,"" says Atlanta priest Ricardo Bailey, with parishioner Kim Schulman. Already a repository for too much information from bloggers divulging their every intimate thought, the Web recently extended its reach into territory the church once dominated. Tens of thousands of the guilty among us are visiting confessional booths at ivescrewedup.com, mysecret.tv and dailyconfessions.com and unburdening themselves anonymously. As priests report a steady decline in sinners showing up to confess in person, according to a Georgetown University study, and parishes across America staff makeshift confessionals in malls with rotating priests, the guilty are repenting online. On camfess.com, a woman admitted, ""I don't think my boyfriend is cute."" If God is checking his e-mail, He might see the ""ask for forgiveness"" form you completed on forgivenet.com. Absolution is also available on YouTube, where videos of members of XXX Church, a team of pastors based in Michigan, discuss their unholy addiction to porn. Admissions on Christian church-operated sites such as ivescrewedup.com and mysecret.tv range from shoe shopping addictions (""I can't stop. They are all so pretty"") to extramarital affairs (""I'm not sure whether I should tell my wife"") to criminal acts (""I have stolen about $15,000 when working for a family member""). The majority of confessions, signed with initials and young ages, are descriptions of shame and guilt associated with sex. Confession 2.0 is a place where anonymity is a substitute for privacy and the intimacy traditionally experienced by talking to a priest, therapist or friend is replaced by a virtual community of strangers. Among the Web site managers CNN spoke with, none has professional counselors monitoring confessions. ""This is a new genre of confession,"" said Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Sherry Turkle, who has researched cyber relationships and interviewed people who post confessions online. ""They have said to me, 'This is where hope is for me.' They think they can find on these sites some kind of goodness that eludes them in real life."" But people who seek something more than their words on a Web site are often disappointed, said Turkle, who's also a psychologist. Most sites do not invite or allow responses to messages, although grouphug.com allows posters to vote ""hug"" or ""shrug"" in response to confessions. ""Some responses are empathetic and kind; others aren't so nice,"" Turkle said. ""The expectation of what you can get out of these sites far exceeds what some ultimately get, and that, in its own way, can be harmful."" ""What these sites say to me is what are we are increasingly missing in our lives: a sense of community and real, tangible connection with other people,"" Turkle said. ""Community"" should have a broader definition, said the Rev. Bobby Gruenewald of Oklahoma-based LifeChurch.tv, an evangelical consortium of 13 churches that launched mysecret.tv in 2006. ""This might be the first time some of these people are opening up about not just secrets in their life, but things they have felt embarrassed about for many years,"" he said. About 30,000 people have posted ""secrets"" on mysecret that are linked to categories such as ""lust,"" ""cheat,"" ""steal"" and even ""beastiality."" When the site was featured on AOL's homepage, more than 1.3 million people clicked on it in a single day, he said. LifeChurch members monitor messages, deleting those that are, in their view, too graphic or fabricated. As on ivescrewedup.com, which is also run by a large church, IP addresses are not tracked. If someone posts a confession of a criminal nature -- someone who says they enjoy child porn or they've committed murder -- there's not much the site managers can do about it. A recent message on ivescrewedup.com reads: ""I have killed four people. One of them was a 17 year old boy."" ""We suspect that is a soldier,"" said the Rev. Troy Gramling of South Florida's Flamingo Road Church, which launched ivescrewedup.com last year. ""We don't want to track IP addresses, because that would compromise the authenticity of a site that says it's anonymous."" The churches' phone numbers are on their sites, both pastors note. ""We're hoping that if they want to reach out and give their name or talk to someone, they will,"" Gruenewald said. The Georgetown University study, which came out in 2005, found a significant decline in Catholics who go to confession. Although the Roman Catholic Church officially opposes online confessions, the Archdiocese of Washington used radio advertisements last year to encourage sinners to return to the sacrament. And in Chicago, Illinois, five parishes hosted ""24 Hours of Grace"" with rotating priests.  Read more about the sacrament known as confession » . But the Web does not offer a road to ""true absolution,"" said Father Ricardo Bailey of Holy Spirit of Atlanta, Georgia. ""I'm not in a drive-through business,"" he said. ""Confessing means you're taking accountability for the things we've done wrong, that you understand the impact you've had on other people. ""As a priest, we ask people questions, we tell them to approach the person or persons they've wronged,"" Bailey said. Online confession ""is another way for people to avoid taking responsibility."" Holy Spirit parishioner Kim Schulman, 38, called online confession ""horrible."" ""It's easy to send an e-mail without emotion or remorse. ... Tone is hard to see in an e-mail,"" she said. ""How do you know that people aren't lying, doing it for the shock value, someone trying to outdo the confession before them?"" But Gramling said online confession is not meant to replace traditional confession. ""Just because confessions don't go directly to God through a priest or a church doesn't mean they aren't sincere,"" he said. ""And there's something healing about just going on the site and reading it, seeing all these other confessions. Some people might realize, 'Maybe I'm not alone.'

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The volume of Hong Kong property sales fell 60% compared with last year in a sign that recent government policies are cooling one of the world's most expensive real estate markets. The Hong Kong Lands Registry recorded about 4,400 sale and purchase agreements in April with a valuation of $4 billion -- a 48% drop compared with the previous year. ""I'm not surprised,"" says Buggle Lau, chief analyst for strategic development and research at Midland Realty. ""This is largely due to the measures implemented by the government. Residential property transactions -- primary and secondary -- dropped significantly. Non-residential transactions also dropped -- industrial spaces, car parks, commercial spaces."" The slowdown in Hong Kong's property sales was expected, echoes Simon Lo, executive director of research and advisory at Colliers International in Hong Kong. ""Most homeowners find they don't have a very strong reason to sell,"" he says. ""They can wait for a couple of years"" because of the government's property policies. On February 22, the city announced a doubling of the existing stamp duty, or DSD, to 8.5% to target investors who want to buy a second property to lease. From April 2010, that rate had been set at 4.25%. In October 2012, to target short-term investors seeking to flip a house for profit, Hong Kong extended the existing special stamp duty, or SSD, on property resales from two to three years. If the owner sold the property within six months of purchase, a 20% duty would apply -- between one and three years, a 10% levy would apply. Also in October, Hong Kong enacted a 15% buyer's stamp duty, or BSD, against home purchases by foreigners. ""Altogether, we're talking about an additional 40-plus percent increase in costs,"" says Lo. ""So you can imagine if you're the buyer then you're just going to hold on and wait."" Hong Kong's layers of levies have also stifled interest from mainland Chinese buyers -- with the 15% tax for foreigners widely interpreted as an attempt to stop them. ""Two years ago, 40% to 50% of all home transactions in Hong Kong were by mainlanders,"" adds Lo. ""Now most buyers are local and most mainlanders aren't making any moves."" In Hong Kong's super luxury market, defined around $13 million and above by Colliers, ""mainland buyers have all dried up"" says Lo. Regular luxury homes, defined at around $2.5 million and above, can often be found in Hong Kong's prime districts of the Mid-Levels and the Peak. ""Two years ago, we would normally have ten to 15 luxury home sales every week. Now it's less than five,"" Lo says. Hong Kong property has notoriously been some of the most expensive in the world for years. As recently as spring 2012, Savills found Hong Kong as the most expensive in a company survey, outranking Singapore, London, Tokyo and Paris. Property prices soared in the special administrative region 50% between 2010 and 2012. Just last year, Hong Kong's priciest apartment -- the Frank Gehry-designed Opus -- sold for $58 million making it one of the most expensive residential properties in the world. But now, as property transactions fall, property prices will follow, say Lau. ""They are falling already,"" he says. ""The average price correction has been 2-3% from March and April -- and it will carry on in May. But property prices have dropped by as much as 6% between January and March for some properties already."" Lau adds that property prices ""are very likely"" to continue to fall but by ""no more than 10%"". ""It's all supply and demand. Demand has dropped significantly even as supply has stayed the same. The only option is to lower the price.""","Hong Kong property sales fell 60% in April 2013 year-on-year .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- In the worst single incident for Kenyan police in living memory, 38 officers were killed in northern Kenya over the weekend by heavily armed cattle rustlers, according to injured police reservists who were on the scene. Local media reports put the number at between 37 and 42 dead. Internal Security Minister Katoo Ole Metito would not give a total figure on how many police officers had died. Read more: Attack on Sunday school leaves child dead, others wounded . The police officers were part of an operation to recover cattle belonging to the Samburu tribe that had been stolen by the Turkana tribe, according to the minister. They were ambushed in a valley when a large group of Turkana fired on police, leaving dozens dead and many injured. The Turkana and Samburu, both pastoralist groups, have frequently engaged in tit-for-tat cattle rustling operations over many years. Villages in the region are heavily fortified by residents, and it's not unusual to see cattle herders armed with automatic rifles. In the most recent incident, Turkana raided the Samburu last month and took a large amount of cattle, according to the internal security ministry. Read more: Kenya military reports success in Somali fight . The Kenyan government intervened and gave an ultimatum for the Turkana to return the cattle last Friday, or it would respond with force. The Turkana did not meet the deadline, prompting the police operation that ended in tragedy. Both Turkana and Samburu leaders have frequently asked for more security in the region from the government. They say the police are outmanned and outgunned. While visiting wounded officers who had been airlifted to a Nairobi hospital, the minister said the government is addressing those complaints. Read more: Is Barack Obama still Kenya's favorite son? ""The ratio of police to civilians in the country is far below the international standards, but we are looking for more resources to bring balance,"" he said, claiming the government is working to reconciling both communities. Some wounded police reservists recovering at the hospital weren't so sure. ""Reconciliation will only work if the Turkana are forcibly removed from Samburu territory. That's the only solution,"" said Ledemiano Lenankani, a Samburu reservist. Lekirnyei Masianai, another reservist, agreed. ""There is no room for reconciliation. I'll not put down my weapon while my community is being attacked.""","The officers were trying to recover stolen cattle, a security official says .

"(CNN) -- Two bartenders have been arrested in connection with the killing of the grandson of civil rights activist Malcolm X, according to the office of the Mexico City attorney general. Prosecutor Rodolfo Fernando Rios Garza said the men work at a bar called The Palace Club where Malcolm Shabazz and three people had drinks early Thursday. An argument ensued when the staff said the bill was $1,200. Shabazz was beaten while another man was threatened and stripped of his belongings, Rios said. Shabazz, 29, was transported to Balbuena General Hospital, where he died of his injuries later Thursday morning, police spokesman Octavio Campos said Friday. The attorney general's office said his injuries were caused by a blunt object and included brain trauma and several broken bones. Prosecutors said there was no video of the killing because several cameras had been moved and others appeared to have been turned to face a wall. Police are looking into the actions of other people that night, the attorney general's office said. The incident took place at Plaza Garibaldi, a rough but famous patch of Mexico City known for its mariachis. ""To all who knew him, he offered kindness, encouragement and hope for a better tomorrow,"" the Shabazz family said in a statement Friday. ""Although his bright light and boundless potential are gone from this life, we are grateful that he now rests in peace in the arms of his grandparents and the safety of God."" A U.S. State Department spokeswoman was aware that a U.S. citizen had died in Mexico but declined to comment further. ""I was saddened, stunned, shocked, to read about the murder of young Malcolm,"" former Georgia congresswoman Cynthia McKinney said. The former lawmaker had taken Shabazz under her wing, and he had traveled with her to Libya. ""Many of my closest associates have personal memories of their time with him and of his efforts to reach out to them for help,"" McKinney said. ""He was writing a book."" In 1997, Shabazz -- then 12 years old -- was convicted of the juvenile equivalent of second-degree manslaughter and second-degree arson for setting the fire that killed his grandmother, Betty Shabazz, in June of that year. During his sentencing, a psychologist described him as a chronic fire-starter and a paranoid schizophrenic. CNN's Elwyn Lopez, Mariano Castillo, Marlena Baldacci, Nick Valencia and Sunny Hostin contributed to this report.","Police are looking at other potential suspects in the case .

"Washington (CNN) -- A prominent House conservative said Tuesday that the immigration reform bill under consideration in the Senate is part of an ongoing plot to build a massive new Democratic voting bloc. America's growing Hispanic vote is ""a huge boon for Democrats. They have known that for a long time,"" said Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. Their message has been that ""we are going to recruit all you folks. That we are going to give amnesty to (you) to become Democrats."" Democratic leaders ""are in the process of seeking to establish another monolithic voting bloc,"" he said. Republicans backing the bipartisan Senate bill ""completely ignore that fact."" King made his remarks at a Capitol Hill press conference with several other House conservatives taking aim at the ""Gang of Eight"" legislation drafted by four Senate Democrats and four Senate Republicans. Controversial immigration report may be right . The bill is winding its way through the Senate Judiciary Committee. Two committee Republicans from the ""Gang of Eight,"" Arizona's Jeff Flake and South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, have been working with the panel's Democratic majority to prevent any major changes to the bill. Another House conservative at the press conference with King, Louisiana GOP Rep. John Fleming, noted the length of the proposal by the ""Gang of Eight,"" 844 pages . ""When in recent years have we passed such a large bill and had a good outcome?"" Fleming asked. ""I'll give you Obamacare and Dodd-Frank (financial reform) as good examples of that. I really think we need to tear this thing up and start from the beginning."" Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, said the ""Gang of Eight"" would be defeated by a ""gang of millions."" ""They will rise up against (the Senate bill) and it will fail because the people are stronger than the 'Gang of Eight,'"" Stockman said. Gay rights, immigration reform on collision course . A bipartisan group of House members has also been working on comprehensive reform legislation. So far, however, they have not presented any broad-based agreement. Backers of the ""Gang of Eight"" legislation are hoping to ultimately win as many as 70 votes in the 100-member Senate to give the legislation serious momentum heading into the more conservative House. The ""Gang of Eight"" blueprint would create a 13-year path to citizenship for the bulk of America's 11 million undocumented immigrants while bringing significant change to labor policy on the country's farms. The bill commits additional resources to security along the Mexican border and creates a new system of metrics to measure border control effectiveness. Critics, however, say the plan is full of holes and translates to amnesty for those who broke the country's immigration laws. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee met Tuesday for a second day of debate and votes on proposed amendments to the plan. Among other things, the panel rejected proposals to tighten future immigration caps and force the creation of a biometric visa identification system before granting permanent legal status to undocumented residents. The two amendments were offered by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, who has emerged as the Senate's leading opponent to the ""Gang of Eight."" Tackling border security in immigration bill .","Iowa Rep.
