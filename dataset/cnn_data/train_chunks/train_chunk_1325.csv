His denial came after X Factor viewers took to Twitter to discuss mysterious marks on her body when she appeared on the talent show's final on Sunday. She had just left hospital where she had been for three days after being admitted with stomach pains. Belafonte described the remarks as 'disgusting', adding: 'I don't usually respond to Twitter msgs but I will respond to comments of hitting wife which I think are quite disgusting untrue'.

X Factor viewers had said that Mel B's arms appeared to be scratched during Sunday's show, but insiders have insisted any marks were caused by her hospital treatment. 'The scratches on her body were due to the hospital care she had before the final,' a source told The Sun. The source added: 'She was advised against appearing on the final on Sunday but Mel is a true professional and didn't want to let the show down. 'But it was obvious to everyone just how much she was suffering and she was crying at certain points during the show.'

One man went to hospital. Mel B said he was defending her. Police were called but no charges brought. Throughout their marriage Mel has stood by her husband and defended husband Stephen  - real name Stephen Stansbury – who has managed to make his fortune making TV and films in Hollywood despite his criminal past. Before they married in Las Vegas in 2007 she was said to be shocked to hear about his history  but  went into the relationship 'with her eyes open'. A friend said at the time: 'Mel knows he's no angel.' Their partnership came after she admitted to having been in a long-term relationship with a woman before falling for Stephen after a kiss and said she 'trusted him 100% with my life'. Soon after their wedding the singer had to defend her husband's past when it emerged that he had battered his common-law wife Nicole Contreras during a drunken row at their home in 2003. The millionaire film producer attacked the mother of his daughter Giselle, now ten, in what was described as a 'malicious and unlawful' drunken frenzy. He did not contest the charge, which the judge said was the same as a guilty plea, and said: 'This happened crazily, one drunk, retarded night.' He was accused of vandalising Nicole's phone by spitting into it but this was dropped. Later he said he did not realise that he had admitted battering his ex-partner, saying that the admission came at a moment when he was 'confused and stressed'. But this plea was rejected. While partying with his wife in 2010,  Belafonte was involved in a fight with three men at the luxury five star May Fair Hotel. One man was left needing hospital treatment following the incident. But Mel B stood by  her burly husband, claiming he was only acting in her defence. She told the Mail: 'He was rushing to the defence of a woman - me. He was my defender. So I can't be mad. It's been blown into more than it was.' Bystanders to the fight reported that it began after film producer Mr Belafonte, who was drinking cocktails in the hotel's Amba Bar & Grill, heard a fellow drinker make a derogatory comment about his wife. The singer then watched on as hotel staff broke-up the fight before police and ambulance arrived on the scene. However, no charges were brought following the incident. Incidents: These pictures show a three-man brawl involving Belafonte at the exclusive May Fair Hotel in 2010 . Aftermath: Hotel staff broke-up the fight before police and ambulance arrived on the scene but no charges were brought following the incident . Explanation: Mel B said later he had been acting in self defence and defending her after someone made a derogatory comment about her . Love: Mel B said she knew about Belafonte's past but trusted him '100 per cent with my life' In 2007 Belafonte admitted killing a mallard with a brick outside his house in the state of New Jersey, but fled to Los Angeles without paying the £300 court fine. Later he told OK magazine: 'Oh, yes, apparently I killed a duck.' 'But I haven't. Sure I got into fights and I did get drunk but I learned from it and I don't do it now.I don't sit around at 33 and panic about the press writing a story that happened when I was 17.' Court papers: These documents describe how Belafonte attacked his former partner in 2003 and how a 1997 burglary charge became a handling stolen goods charge . Support: The singer, left kissig her husband, had to defend his past when it emerged that he had battered his ex partner Nicole Contreras, together right, during a drunken row at their home in 2003. Belafonte's criminal past is known to have started 20 years ago. The then 19-year-old was arrested for burglary in New Jersey in 1994. He failed to show for a court appearance in 1995 and was arrested on the warrant in 2001. He was eventually convicted for receiving stolen property under the value of $200 after the burglary charge and one of theft was dropped. In 2000 he was accused of assaulting two men in a row on a highway, and according to initial charges he threw a missile of some sort at their car. The assault case was reduced to vandalism after he agreed to pay for the damage caused to the vehicle and he had to do community service at a children's home. It is alleged that he failed to reveal that he had married Nancy Carmell in Las Vegas in 1997 on his marriage paperwork when he married Mel B. He and Ms Carmell separated within three months, with his then wife going home to Hawaii and they divorced two years later. An ex-girlfriend, who did not want to be named, claimed he persistently cheated on her. She said 'He never invited me over, never introduced me to his friends, never talked about his family. We met about two weeks after he broke up with the mother of his daughter. 'But he later told me that he was still sleeping with her throughout the whole time we dated. I knew in my gut something wasn't right about this guy.'","Stephen Belafonte's first arrest dates back to 1994, when he was aged 19 .

"Michael Bisping kept his hopes of a title shot alive with a stoppage victory over Cung Le in Macau. The British middleweight was looking for his first win in almost 18 months after suffering a tame defeat by Tim Kennedy in April. Bisping slowly but surely wore Le down before the fight was stopped in the fourth round. After a competitive opening session, Bisping landed a jab which cut Le near his left eye. Fight: A cut to Cung Le's left eye meant the fight was stopped in the fourth round in Macau . The 42-year-old complained he had been poked in the eye but replays showed otherwise. The doctor allowed the fight to continue and Bisping edged the third round to carve out a lead before finishing the job in the next session. A barrage of blows left Le badly beaten and the referee stepped in to stop the contest. Bisping then called out Luke Rockhold as he bids to work his way towards the title shot that has so far eluded him. He said: ‘There’s an idiot called Luke Rockhold who doesn’t stop talking about me. I think he’s got the hots for me, to be honest. ‘I’m going to beat him then take the title, make no mistake!’ Claims: The 42-year-old said he had been poked in the eye but video replays suggested otherwise .

"Powdered alcohol hasn't even arrived in stores yet, but states already are moving to ban the product touted by its inventor as an easy way to mix a drink on the go. Colorado is the latest state considering prohibiting 'Palcohol' amid concern it will increase underage drinking. The product is marketed as an ounce of rum or vodka in powdered form, which is then added to water. Each serving is the equivalent of a shot of liquor, according to Lipsmark, the company that owns Palcohol. Scroll down for video . Legislators in five states have already outlawed Palcohol before its planned launch next year . The controversial product is awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration before it can launch . 'I think being proactive and jumping out in front of the problem is probably the right thing to do,' said Chris Johnson, executive director of the County Sheriffs of Colorado. 'It really doesn't have any place in our society, powered alcohol. We have enough problems with the liquid kind.' Johnson said he fears powdered alcohol will make it easier for children to 'sprinkle it on top of their Wheaties for breakfast' and increase the potential for alcohol poisoning. 'It can be a very dangerous thing,' he said. The company's website notes various instances where they argue the product would be convenient, including on flights and as an antiseptic on remote locations. Palcohol's creator, Mark Phillips, said he thought of the idea because it would be easier to carry powder for a drink during a long hike or other outdoor activities. Alaska, Delaware, Louisiana, South Carolina and Vermont already have banned powdered alcohol, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Minnesota, Ohio, and New York also are considering bans, the organization said. Colorado Republican JoAnn Windholz is planning to introduce a ban on Palcohol in her home state . In a video posted on the company's website, Phillips dismisses the concerns about underage drinking, noting the product would be sold only at liquor stores to people 21 and older. In the video, he also argues it would be impractical for people to snort the powder, as some critics fear, because it would be painful to do and the amount of powder in a package fills about half a glass tumbler. The company doesn't expect Palcohol will be available in stores until spring 2015 at the earliest. They're still waiting for labeling approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. The Food and Drug Administration said it does not have a legal basis to block the product after examining the non-alcoholic ingredients in the powder. Lynne Barbour, director of communications for Palcohol, said states should control the product instead of banning it. 'We believe it should be regulated and taxed,' she said in an email. In addition to making Palcohol available as powdered rum and vodka, the company plans four cocktail varieties — Cosmopolitan, Mojito, Lemon Drop, and Powderita. Republican Rep. JoAnn Windholz is sponsoring a bill to ban powdered alcohol in Colorado during the legislative session that begins next month. She said it's prudent for states to ban the product until they know how it can affect people if it happens to be stronger than liquid alcohol — another concern Phillips contends is unfounded. Windholz said states should make sure they have a regulatory system in place before allowing powdered alcohol to be sold. 'It can be taken into schools, it can be taken into sports (events), Broncos games, whatever,' she said.","Legislators are considering a powdered alcohol ban before its US launch .

"There are plenty of Hollywood actors who would fancy themselves in the ring - Jean-Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, The Rock to name just a few - but according to UFC star Cung Le, none would be as effective in MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) as Channing Tatum. The two have trained together before and  Le, an action film star himself, is impressed with his friend's natural ability, who is best known by many for his comedic roles in the 21 Jump Street series. 'Channing would actually have the best chance out there of anyone else,' Le told FOX Sports. VIDEO: Channing Tatum trains in Mixed Martial Arts with UFC fighter Cung Le! 'He's strong, he's physical and he's not scared at all,' said Le, who worked with Tatum in the 2009 movie Fighting. 'If he would dedicate as much time as he did in the movies [to MMA], he would do fine.' When Tatum was filming Foxcatcher, which will premiere in November, Le drilled wrestling with him, and although the actor struggled at times, Le was impressed. Relentless: Channing Tatum impressed Cung Le with his energy and attitude towards fighting . Brutal: Le has established himself as one of the stars of UFC and takes no prisoners in the ring . No contest: Le thinks Channing Tatum has more of what it takes to be a fighter than Jean-Claude Van Damme . 'All you have to do is carry yourself like a wrestler, look like a wrestler and do takedowns and shoots like a wrestler,' Le told him. 'He didn't need to do all that.' Le trained Tatum in different techniques for two hours and said that by the end, most people watching would have thought Tatum had a wrestling background. 'It was just all drilling for two hours and he looked the part,' Le said. 'Not anyone can do that in that quick a time.' Take that! Le is put through his paces as he delivers a high kick as part of his training routine . As for Van Damme, Le starred with him in the 2012 flick Dragon Eyes and, after sparring with him, didn't come away thinking that the Belgian could cut it in the UFC. 'His technique is very clean, very sharp,' Le said. 'He's a good martial artist… there's a new breed these days. MMA fighters are top of the food chain. Some of them might not punch and kick as pretty as Van Damme, but it's a different level.' Tatum will be in Macao next week for Le's UFC fight against Michael Bisping.","UFC fighter Cung Le has trained with Channing Tatum and was impressed .

"Problem: American teens have some of the highest rates of binge drinking in the developed world . American teenagers have the highest rates of drug and alcohol abuse in the developed world. And they are far more likely to be killed by violence than peers in Europe. This lost generation, whose unemployment rate is 20 percent, leads the modern world in some of the most dangerous and irresponsible behaviors, according to a new study released by the Lancet medical journal. The shocking data was released to highlight cultural neglect occurring in the adolescents and young adults -- too many of whom die young, according to the researchers behind the publication. Not all the news is bad. American teens appear to have the highest rates of exercise in the developed world. Despite this, American teens, age 13 to 15 are dramatically more likely to be overweight, leading the western world, according to the data. Among the most startling discoveries of the Lancet data is how much higher the rates of teen violent death are in the US than the rest of the developed world. About 17 in 100,000 teen boys age 15 to 19 are killed by violence. The next two closest countries are Israel and Switzerland, with four. Britain's rate is just one. The teen drinking statistics come with an important caveat. Some 30 percent of American 13 to 15 year-old-girls reported binge drinking in the last 30 days -- more than any other developed country. However, several nations -- among them Britain -- were not included in the data. Britain has the third highest proportion of sexually active teenagers in the world as well as some of the worst levels of harmful underage drinking. The research found that sexual activity among 13 to 15-year-olds was highest among girls in Denmark followed by Iceland, the UK and Sweden. Greece and Denmark had the highest rates among boys. The lowest rates in boys were in Belgium, and for girls Israel. US rates of young teen sex were about average for the developed world, with about 25 percent of boys and 26 percent of girls saying they had sex before age 15. Boys in the United States, age 15 to 19, are more than four times more likely to be killed by violence than the next-most violent industrialized country. Here is the list of the Western nations with the highest rates of violent death per 100,000 teens: . 1. United States -- 17 . 2. Israel -- 4 . 3. Switzerland -- 4 . 4. Canada -- 3 . 5. Ireland -- 3 . 6. New Zealand -- 3 . 7. Estonia -- 2 . 8. Sweden -- 2 . *United Kingdom -- 1 . England had the fourth highest percentage of youngsters who have been drunk by the age of 13 in a league table of 40 mostly high income countries. Wales was fifth and Scotland eighth. Wales was third for those drinking weekly at the age of 15, with England fourth and Scotland again eighth. The figures are taken from 2006, the last year with internationally comparable data, with new estimates in the coming months set to provide an opportunity for the UK to assess whether policies to reduce harmful drinking among teenagers have had any impact over the past five years. Teenagers' general well being has . improved far less over the last 50 years than that of children under 10 . with evidence suggesting adolescence is not the healthiest time of life, . as is often assumed. A . lack of focus on adolescent health could be described as a 'missing . link' in the approach to health, an international team of scientists . warn. The statistics are revealed in two . studies by Professor George Patton, of the University of Melbourne in . Australia, and colleagues which was published in The Lancet Series on . Adolescent Health. The . first paper says even the explosion in social media such as Facebook and . Twitter has both good and bad points for young people. While it enables them to be catalysts . for community change, as happened in the uprisings of the Middle East . and North Africa, it also exposes adolescents to new risks such as . cyber-bullying, and sexting, the act of sending sexually explicit or . pornographic messages by mobile phone. There . are now some 1.8 billion adolescents aged between ten and 24 in the . world today, comprising more than a quarter of the population. Peer pressure: Statistics published in the medical journal the Lancet show that youngsters are more at risk from drug taking and sexually transmitted diseases than ever before . Teen girls in the United States have the highest rates of binge drinking in the developed world, according to the survey. It should be noted, however, that the results for several nations were not included in the survey -- most importantly, Britain. The following is data shows the percentage of girls, age 13 to 15, who reported binge drinking at least once in the last 30 days: . 1. United States -- 30 percent . 2. Ireland -- 29 percent . 3. Austria -- 28 percent . 4. Iceland -- 26 percent . 5. Malta -- 21 percent . 6. Switzerland -- 16 percent . 7. Luxembourg -- 13 percent . 8. France -- 12 percent . The . researchers said with longer periods in education, and significant . delays to marriage or settling down, the period during which young . people are exposed to the risks of adolescence has extended . significantly. Such behaviours include harmful alcohol consumption and illicit drug use with peers, and sex with more casual partners, increasing the risk of sexually transmitted infections. Prof Patton said: 'The present . generation of young people will take a different path through . adolescence from previous generations and will face new challenges to . their health and well-being along the way.' Programmes to promote maternal, . newborn and child health across countries of all incomes have led to . more children surviving and the current adolescent population boom, . known as the 'youth bulge'. Over . the same period digital media, industrialisation, globalisation and . urbanisation have changed traditional family and community influences, . resulting in less 'social scaffolding' of adolescents. The . researchers said many health-related behaviours that usually start in . adolescence such as smoking and drinking, obesity and physical . inactivity contribute to the epidemic of non-communicable diseases . including heart disease, cancer, diabetes and lung disease. New threat: The explosion in social media exposes adolescents to new risks such as cyber-bullying . More American boys age 13 to 15 say they get more than an hour of exercise per week than teens in any over developed nation. 1. United States -- 35 percent . 2. Canada -- 31 percent . 3. Czech Republic -- 28 percent . 4. Austria - 27 percent . 5. Ireland -- 27 percent . 6. Belgium -- 24 percent . 8. Finland -- 24 percent . 9. Iceland -- 24 percent . 10. Israel -- 24 percent . 11. Netherlands -- 24 percent . 12. United Kingdom -- 24 percent . Studies . on adolescent brains suggest they are more affected than adults by . exciting or stressful situations when making decisions. Increased . activity in the nucleus accumbens, a reward and pleasure centre, appears . linked to this. While the death rate among under fives has declined by 80 per cent or more in many countries in the past fifty years, adolescent mortality has only marginally improved. The major causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYS), a measure that combines burden of mortality and disease, in adolescents are alcohol use (seven per cent), unsafe sex (four per cent), iron deficiency (three per cent), lack of contraception (two per cent) and drugs abuse (two per cent). Prof Patton said: 'Irrespective of region, most adolescent deaths are preventable and thus strongly justify worldwide action to enhance adolescent health. 'In view of their dynamic and challenging health profile, the contribution of adolescent health to the global burden of disease, and the important effect of adolescents and their health across the life course, adolescents should be more prominent within future global public health policies and programming.' The second paper revealed the UK had the fifteenth lowest rate for adolescent mortality in a league of 27 high income countries. The UK was also mid ranking for both boys and girls in cannabis use. Surprisingly, despite its obesity epidemic, boys aged 13 to 15 in the USA exercised more than boys in any other of the 16 countries reporting data, and American girls had the second highest levels of exercise behind Ireland, which was in second place for boys. The UK finished eighth best for girls in the amount of exercise they did, and fifth best for boys out of sixteen countries reporting data. Prof Patton added: 'For the largest generation in the world's history, the available global profile of youth health is worrying.'","Youngsters 'more at risk from binge drinking, drug taking and STDs than ever before'

"A teenager trapped in a car with his disabled sister managed to keep calm while an aggressive marine raged outside – by turning up the radio and listening to AC/DC. Mike McCurdy-Quintana was with his sister Bree - who is a marine herself and is now confined to a wheelchair following an injury - when the incident occurred and she caught his violent outburst on camera. After the two cars touched bumpers, Sergeant Joshua Brigthman stormed out of the truck and approached the 19-year-old's window. But instead of reasoning with him, Mr Brightman saw red - and threatened to kill him. Mr McCurdy-Quintana locked the windows and turned up the radio, which was playing an AC/DC song, to drown out the marine’s expletive-laden tirade. Infuriated that he was being ignored, Mr Brightman turned on Mr McCurdy-Quintana’s sister who was on her way to collect her three-year-old son from nursery in Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, San Diego, in the US. Like her brother, she ignored the furious marine and concentrated on filming him on her camera phone. Following the incident, Mr McCurdy-Quintana told Inside Edition that he wanted to diffuse the angry man. Keeping calm: Mike McCurdy-Quintana turns up the radio to drown out the angry marine who goes mad after the 19-year-old knocks the bumper of his truck . He said: ‘I guess I just went into the ""nothing zone."" I just listened to the music and blocked him out and just kept staring. ‘Me looking at him, he would just have gotten more enraged, and I notice on the video at one point that I do look at him and he does get more enraged. ‘I was prepared to get out and confront the man, but as soon as he said, ""I am going to f***ing kill you,"" I immediately locked the doors.’ What upset Mr McCurdy-Quintana most was the way the marine treated his sister. The video shows Mr Brightman yelling, ‘Take a f***ing video you f***.’ ‘It was uncalled for—for the words, and what he said to my sister. It's just disrespectful for anyone to hear those words.’ Mr Brightman, who is a veteran of Afghanistan and a recipient of the Purple Heart, a US medal awarded to those wounded or killed in action, later apologised. But the teenager does not believe he is truly sorry. Mr McCurdy-Quintana said: ‘The way he said it did not feel like it was sincere, whatsoever.’ No charges were filed at the time. Mr Brightman’s father Peter later spoke out to say his son’s behaviour was inappropriate, but that he was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress after serving two tours in Afghanistan.","Mike McCurdy-Quintana was driving his disabled sister to collect her toddler .

New approach: Nadia Bolz-Weber is a rising star in the Lutheran church who has a growing congregation . Reverend Bolz-Weber, who has experimented with Wicca, is now the pastor of All Sinners and Saints - a Lutheran church in Denver, Colorado. While normal church events might end with the congregation blessing themselves on the way out, this church prefers to have a dance party featuring a chocolate fountain in the baptismal font. But despite her alternative approach, her quirky sermons which are littered with profanities has worked. Her congregation is growing and hundreds of people now peer out from the among the pews to listen to her preach. 'We are all about Jesus. But to have humor and lightness and irreverence is our version of piety,' she told Spirituality and Health. Nadia Bolz-Weber was once a drug and alcohol addict but turned to the church and hasn't looked back . The married mother-of-two has now written a spiritual memoir about her journey called Pastrix: The Cranky Faith of a Sinner and Saint. The book is near the top of the New York Times bestseller list after it was released in September. And she doesn't hold back. From a teenage rebellion against her fundamentalist Christianity, drug and alcohol addiction and doing stand-up in a comedy club in Denver, she describes herself as one of society's outsiders.

Andie Lyons, right, and her partner, Laurie Lynch, are joined in a civil union ceremony by Nadia Bolz-Weber at the Webb Building in Denver in May . There are 66 million Lutherans worldwide, according to The Lutheran World Federation. They follow a creed founded by the German monk and professor Martin Luther in the early 16th century, which makes it the oldest protestant denomination. He was disillusioned with the Catholic Church, perceiving it to be corrupt and indulgent. Germany is still the spiritual home of Lutheranism, but it's also the official state church of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland, according to religionfacts.com. Bolz-Weber started getting tattoos when she was 17 but the ones on her arms are mainly religious. She has the church year down one arm and images which include images for . Advent, Christmas, Lent, Good Friday and Pentecost. 'In . a way, my arms are like the stained glass in a medieval cathedral. They . are pedagogical.

And then I’m telling the story of Jesus. It’s a . no-brainer.' As a teenager she felt that she never quite belonged and turned to drink and drugs for about a decade. But she says she never stopped believing in God. It was during her recovery that she met Lutheran seminary student Matthew Weber who brought her back to the church.

"TLC's My 600-lb Life is back with its third season next month, and its first subject is so morbidly obese, she is unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time. At only 24 years old, Amber, from Troutdale, Oregon, weighs 660lbs and lives at home with her parents and boyfriend of two years. She says she feels like 'a nasty yucky monster.' Amber, who will undergo high-risk gastric bypass surgery as part of the series, fears she will 'never be able to change' by herself. She suffers from pain in her back and her shins, and must bathe sitting over a toilet. Housebound: Amber, 24, from Troutdale, Oregon, (pictured) will be first to appear on season three of TLC's My 600-lb Life. She weighs 660lbs and is unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time . Amber, who admits she is 'killing herself' with her over-eating, dropped out of Portland State University and quit her job a while ago, but hopes having surgery will allow her to return to her education. 'I feel trapped,' she says. 'I feel miserable. I feel like I have failed myself and my parents.' The hit reality series will also follow the lives of seven other morbidly obese individuals as they undergo gastric bypass surgery in a bid to shed the weight that has rendered most of them housebound for years. One thing all the subjects have in common, aside from their weight struggles, is at least one traumatic childhood event they point to as a cause. Ordeal: Amber, who admits she is 'killing herself' with food, must bathe herself sitting down (pictured) Susan is a 37-year-old woman who has never lived on her own. She weighs almost 600lbs and resides at home in Eddy, Texas, with her mother, who is her caretaker and enabler. Susan traces her weight issues back to the divorce of her parents as a young child, which triggered depression and 'trust issues.' According to TLC, Susan's life consists of work, the fast food drive-thru, and sitting in her trailer, and she no longer feels comfortable going out in public. Pauline, 50, from Sacramento, California, also attributes the start of her problems with food to her parents' divorce, after which she says she did not get enough to eat. After her parents reconciled, food was suddenly plentiful again, but Pauline found she 'didn't know when to stop eating' and had ballooned to over 200lbs by the age of 12. By the time she was married, Pauline weighed 500lbs and since her divorce, she has climbed to nearly 700lbs. Desperate for change: Amber lives at home with her parents and boyfriend of two years, and says she feels like 'a nasty yucky monster' Daily struggle: Even getting up the stairs is a monumental task, often leading her to fall . Bettie Jo is 24 and lives in Potosi, Missouri with her husband of four years, Josh. Bettie Joe is eager to start a family but at nearly 700lbs, is unable to. She is confined to a chair in her living room and her weight is a constant source of conflict between her and Josh, who is described as her Jo's 'primary caretaker rather than romantic partner.' Laura, 40, from San Antonio, Texas, has been gaining weight all her life and now at 554lbs is 'close to giving up.' She too is confined to her chair due to lymphedema - a chronic swelling of the body tissue - and skin ulcers. Because her husband has multiple sclerosis, neither can properly care for one another, so they live with Laura's parents. Angel is 42 and lives in Kerville, Texas. She grew up 'thin and gangly' but began to put on weight when she was forced by her mother to give up her baby at the age of 14. She had her second child when she was 20 and weighed 300lbs. After the death of her father and the birth of her third child, Angel fell into a deep depression and 'ate herself into oblivion.' She now weighs 596lbs, is nearly immobile and her boyfriend Donnie feels she has 'shut herself off from life.' Given up: Amber dropped out of Portland State University and quit her job a while ago . Miserable: She hopes that having gastric bypass surgery will allow her to return to her education . Charity, 38 from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has been overweight since the age of five, having been physically and emotionally abused throughout her childhood. She gave birth to her daughter Charley at the age of 19, who became her mother's caregiver when she was only eight. Charley and her boyfriend now share the care taking duties of Charity, who weighs 787lbs. Joe, the only male subject to appear in the upcoming series, is 31 and lives in Johnson City, Tennessee. He weighs 802lbs and was 'a chunky baby and a picky eater as a child, who eschewed all vegetables.' Joe recently lost his job in IT and now eats, sleeps and lives in the same living room chair 24 hours a day. He is completely immobile and unable to bathe himself, and like the rest of TLC's subjects, desperately hopes he can win his life back after undergoing surgery.

"Pakistan has been braced for this kind of bloodthirsty attack, writes Ian Birrell, but lashing out in this way is seen by some experts as a sign of weakness . At first staff thought it was just children playing a boisterous game, for as older pupils sat exams on the upper floor a party was being held for younger classes. But then they saw the armed gunmen, the blood and the bodies. The Taliban murderers picked their target with precision then issued a chilling statement. ‘We selected the army’s school for the attack because the government is targeting our families and females. We want them to feel our pain.’ Nine gunmen stormed the military school in the north-western Pakistani city of Peshawar today, killing up to 140 children. Pakistan has been bracing itself for attack after a military crackdown on the Taliban's tribal heartlands but nothing of this depravity . As heartbroken relatives buried their dead, the Taliban made it clear this horrific attack was a response to the operation which has wiped out many of its fighters in its North Waziristan stronghold. They said they wanted the government to 'feel their pain' More than 1,600 militants have died in recent months but the Taliban designed the attack to send a message written in blood to the military, which claimed to have cleared them out of their tribal region . This cruel attack on an easy target is designed to make a spectacular statement with the least possible cost for the Taliban . Pakistan has been braced for this kind of bloodthirsty attack. It is the savage response to a military crackdown on the group’s tribal heartlands, which claims to have wiped out hundreds of militants. This is, after all, a terror group that has made widespread use of suicide bombing, attacked hundreds of schools, massacred teachers, shot a schoolgirl who dared show defiance to them and even killed hundreds of worshippers at mosques and shrines. Yet it is also a reaction to shifting geopolitics in the region since the election of a new president in Afghanistan, which threatens the Taliban even in its traditional stronghold. Analysts say the sickening slaughter of schoolchildren symbolises its sudden weakness. Clearly it is designed to send a message written in blood to the military that claims to have cleared the Taliban from much of its regional stronghold in the country. But it is hard to think of a softer target than a school filled with army children and, for all the horror, may indicate the success of concerted attacks on the long-feared terrorist organisation. As one expert said, this cruel shift in tactics to such an easy target is designed to make a spectacular statement with the least possible cost for the Taliban. For years Islamabad resisted attacking the fanatics in North Waziristan, on the north-west frontier with Afghanistan. Both countries blamed their neighbours for harbouring terrorists - with strong justification. But in recent months Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the militant’s umbrella group that has killed thousands of people in Pakistan, has come under new pressure. First a US drone strike killed long-haired leader Hakimullah Mehsud late last year - and successor has struggled to hold together the organisation as it came under fierce attack. Splits have been evident with some senior figures pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, while others recently launched a splinter group of al-Qa’ida in the Indian sub-continent. A father mourns the loss of his son who was killed by Taliban militants. Talat Masood, a retired general and security analyst, said the attack was an attempt to weaken military resolve in the region . A tearful young pupil lies injured after the second assault in less than six-months by Taliban militants. A June attack on Karachi airport left 28 dead . Bombing raids were launched from the air on the Taliban’s north-western strongholds in February. These were followed four months later by Operation Zarb-e-Azb, which has since killed more than 1,600 militants. The recent election of Ashraf Ghani as president of Afghanistan, combined with improved relations between Islamabad and Washington as well as with Kabul, has made life tougher for the terrorists on both sides of the border. Over the past fortnight there have been a series of counter-insurgency assaults on the Taliban in Afghanistan. On one day this month a US drone killed nine leading militants and a senior commander captured by US troops in Afghanistan was handed over to Islamabad. ‘This is something new - Afghanistan and Pakistan seem to have finally realised they have a common enemy,’ said Gareth Price, senior research fellow with Chatham House think tank. ‘Lashing out at schoolchildren in this way is a sign of weakness. The TTP made it clear this horrific attack in Peshawar was a response to the military operation and the wiping out of its fighters. There have been other recent outrages in reaction to the assaults on its heartland. In June, 10 militants armed with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and suicide bomb vests mounted a raid on Karachi airport that left 28 people dead and damaged several planes. Operations by the Pakistani military have seen a substantial fall in the number of terrorist attacks in the country. Army commandos quickly arrived at the school and exchanged fire with the gunmen, but they could not prevent many children being massacred . The Pakistani Taliban has splintered into several groups after a US drone strike killed their Hakimullah Mehsud, but they remain a powerful force in the region . Talat Masood, a retired general and security analyst, said this latest attack was designed to weaken military resolve. ‘They are going for soft targets,’ he said. ‘These attacks have a great psychological impact.’ Although Pakistan has long worried about cracking down on militants, fearing the kind of bloodbaths as seen in Karachi and Peshawar, its operations have led to a substantial fall in the number of terrorist attacks in the country. Yet Naveed Ahmad, an investigative journalist and security analyst, said the country had been expecting a backlash. ‘These people have been looking for an opportunity and the trouble is our security is so superficial, which makes it easier for them. ‘No-one is ever held accountable for the security failures. So we saw no-one fired after the airport attack, for instance.’ Others queried whether even this attack on a school, killing scores of innocent pupils, will change attitudes. Two months ago 17-year-old Malala Yousafzai - shot in the head by Taliban militants - became the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for her campaigning on female education. Yet the honour received scant mention in much of the Pakistan media, criticism from prominent figures in the country and scathing attacks on social media.","Pakistan has been bracing itself for an attack of this type of attack .

"Speaking at a conference in London today, Sir Bruce Keogh said: 'The system is creaking, it is under pressure at the moment' Accident and emergency services are already under strain from increased winter demand, the medical director of the NHS in England has admitted. Speaking at a conference in London, Sir Bruce Keogh said: 'The system is creaking, it is under pressure at the moment. 'A&Es are having to address increasing demand, the ambulance services are struggling in many parts of the country and we have a number of issues to deal with, which we are tackling.' Also speaking at the conference, Dr Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said increased pressure was partly due to ambulances being called by NHS 111 operators. However Sir Bruce said forward planning meant the NHS should cope better with a spike in demand for A&E services this winter. Measures included a flu plan announced in April and a system to help trusts which were struggling to plan for winter, launched in June. A £400 million injection of funding from the Department of Health in June also helped preparation, he said. Another £300 million boost in October assisted with staffing and bed capacity. Sir Bruce said: 'We've started to address winter much sooner than in any of the other years. 'In winter we know that the demand on A&E changes. 'So while the activity might be slightly lower than during the summer, the proportion of people who need admission is higher.' He said high expectations from the public and budget cutbacks were also making it more difficult for the NHS to succeed. Sir Bruce defended proposals to overhaul the health system to create 'supercentre' specialist A&E departments. The Keogh review, published last November, advocated the concentrating of accident and emergency services into a few specialist hospitals. He said: 'There has been a slow and inadvertent deception that all A&Es are equal. They are not, and people in the know know that.' He also said that demographic changes has placed greater strain on the NHS and that younger people had 'an expectation of an immediacy of service'. Dr Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, speaking at the same conference, said: 'I think the system is under pressure but it's working pretty well.' He said that increased pressure was partly due to ambulances being called by NHS 111 operators. Earlier this week it was reported that  casualty departments were forced to close their doors to ambulances nearly 100 times last month as they failed to cope with soaring patient numbers, alarming figures show. In total, around 27,000 patients were stuck inside the backs of ambulances outside A&E units for at least half an hour because staff were too busy to take them in – a third more than this time last year. Scroll down for video . Sir Bruce said A&Es are having to address increasing demand, the ambulance services are struggling in many parts of the country . In the worst cases they were turned away altogether. And in early December, more than 35,000 patients were forced to wait more than four hours in A&E – the worst figure on record – separate statistics reveal. Experts warned that the ‘bleak’ figures were indicative of a ‘crisis’ in the NHS and showed the system was ‘cracking under extreme pressure.’ And they say the situation could worsen over the next month. NHS chiefs finally released the data indicating how hospitals are coping with the pressures of winter five weeks later than planned yesterday. They show the situation is far worse compared with this time last year. Waiting times data is normally released on a weekly basis from the start of November. But NHS England said that it was being held back while they ‘reviewed’ the information – prompting concerns they were trying to delay bad news. Last week, more than 35,000 patients had to wait more than four hours in A&E – the worst figure on record . The 95 occasions that overstretched casualty units had to divert ambulances to other hospitals is almost double the 48 in the same period last year. A total of 6,968 operations had to be cancelled – 367 which were urgent – and 33 patients waited on trolleys in corridors for more than 12 hours. Several hospital trusts are now on ‘black alert’ – whereby GPs are urged not to send in patients – and senior NHS managers in some areas of the country have admitted the situation is the worst in living memory. The figures show A&E units are already under considerable pressure even though winter is barely under way. The crisis is partly due to bed-blocking, where elderly patients stay in hospital despite being fit for discharge because of a lack of care for them at home. In addition, record numbers of patients are visiting A&E because they are unable to get an appointment with their GP. Separate weekly data shows that 35,373 patients waited more than four hours in A&E – the Government’s target – a record number since data was first published in November 2010. Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association’s council which represents senior doctors, said: ‘These figures point to a system cracking under extreme pressure, leading to unacceptable delays in care. ‘While the NHS is used to seeing a spike in demand during winter months, this year it’s experienced a spring, summer and autumn crisis as well, leaving no spare capacity in hospitals as we hit winter.’ Last month the Government announced that A&E units would get an extra £700million to avert a winter crisis, a sum that senior doctors described as little more than a ‘sticking plaster’. Dame Barbara Hakin, NHS England’s National Director of Commissioning Operations blamed the crisis on soaring numbers arriving in A&E and having to be admitted on to hospital wards. There were 436,229 attendances last week – up nearly 30,000 on the average typically seen for this time of year. Dr Peter Carter, Chief Executive and General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Last year’s winter pressures on hospitals and A&E never went away – our health service is now running at capacity all year round, and a bad winter could spell disaster. ‘Staff are working incredibly hard to care for record numbers of patients, but the system is failing both staff and patients.’ Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the figures should be a ‘wake-up call’.","Sir Bruce Keogh said today: 'The system is creaking, it is under pressure'

"More than a dozen passengers and crew have reportedly been injured after an American Airlines flight was rocked by severe turbulence over the Pacific Ocean. Passengers were settling into their 12-hour transpacific journey from Seoul to Dallas when the Boeing 777-200 hit turbulent skies east of Japan, sending glass 'flying' inside the aircraft cabin, according to a woman on board. With as many as 15 passengers and crew reportedly in need of medical assistance the flight crew declared an emergency, turned the plane around and diverted to Narita International Airport near Tokyo.

"A Las Vegas mother, her ex-husband and his new wife all faced court on Tuesday after being charged with what police described as  'one of the most horrific sex rings in memory' involving their own children. Mother-of-four Terrie L. Sena, 43, who was arrested last week and charged with multiple counts of disturbing sexual abuse in Clark County, has been a licensed kindergarten through 12th grade substitute teacher since May 2013, according to The Las Vegas Review Journal. Along with her ex-husband Christopher Sena, 47, and his current wife Deborah Sena, 50, the trio are accused of engaging in sex acts with at least eight minors and filming some of the encounters as part of a child porn operation. The eight children identified as being abused were immediate and extended family members, police said. Despite the strange relationship dynamic, all three live together in the same trailer home. In court on Tuesday: Christopher Sena, 47 (left) and his current wife Deborah Sena, 50 (right), are facing a total of 50 sexual abuse charges involving eight child victims over 12 years . Disturbing: Mother-of-four Terrie Sena, 43, a Clark County School District substitute teacher, is accused of participating in the sex ring. She is seen at left in her mugshot and at right in court this week . Scene: Officers searched the Vegas trailer home of Christopher Sena, where they allege the abuse occurred . Investigators believe there are more victims and say the sex crimes have been going on for at least 12 years. Some of the victims are now adults, police said. Terrie and Christopher Sena had three sons and a daughter together before splitting in 1997. However Terrie continued to live with her ex and their children, even when he took a new wife. Police found out about the alleged sex ring in September after the new wife Deborah Sena, another adult and a child told a family law attorney about the abuse. Charged: Christopher Sena, 47,was arrested September 19 after investigators identified him as the alleged ring leader, while his current wife Deborah Sena (right) and ex Terrie Sena were arrested Thursday . Hangout: Neighbors say the home was a meeting point for alot of children in the area . Deborah Sena is said to have left her husband in August, moving out of the home where the alleged abuse occurred. A Metro SWAT team served a search warrant on their trailer home in the 6000 block of Yellow Stone Drive, near Lake Mead Boulevard and Mount Hood Street, on September 18. Officers found at least 30 pieces of electronic and recording equipment. A subsequent investigation lead to the arrest of Christopher Sena, who is facing 23 charges, including incest, bestiality and felony child abuse. Many of the charges carry a sentence up to life in prison. Deborah Sena told police that there was 'fear and intimidation' involved when it came to dealing with her husband Christopher (pictured together in an old photo), whom she split from in August . Debra Sena was charged with four counts of open and gross lewdness, two counts of sex assault against a child less than 14 and two counts of incest, among other charges . Christopher Sena was charged with five counts of child abuse or neglect, four counts of incest and three counts each of sex assault against a child less than 14, sex assault and lewdness with a child less than 14 . One of the seized recordings allegedly shows two Sena children having sex with the family dog, The Daily Beast reported. A review of other the recordings allegedly implicated Terrie and Deborah Sena. The pair were arrested on December 11 and together face 27 charges, including child abuse and neglect, sexual assault of a minor and incest. More charges related to child pornography are expected to be laid. All three appeared in Las Vegas Justice court Tuesday morning. The court heard that Christopher Sana threaten to break the legs of one of his alleged victims if the child told anyone of the abuse, according to KLAS-TV. Neighbors describe the Sena property as a meeting point for many children in the community and was often the place many of the kids would hang out. 'Sick': Christopher Sena has been described as a 'monster', sexually assaulting at least eight children . Home: All three Sena family members lived here,  in the 6000 block of Yellow Stone Drive . Christopher Sena would erect a projector screen in the yard and hold movie nights, the neighbors said. The two women appeared in court on Monday before Judge Nancy Oesterle, who described their charges as 'extremely shocking and disturbing'. 'That’s putting it mildly,' Judge Oesterle said. Both women said they cannot afford an attorney. All three Senas have been held without bail.","Terrie Sena, 43, is a licensed substitute teacher in Clark Country,Nevada .

"The humble chopping board is integral to even the most basic of kitchen cupboards. From raw meat to organic root vegetables, most of what we eat will pass across its surface en route to pan or oven. Now, a new survey has revealed the chopping board to be one of the most dangerous utensils, harbouring 200 per cent more faecal bacteria than the average toilet seat. The research, commissioned by the Global Hygiene Council, found 40 per cent of all food poisoning cases are caused by poor hygiene in the home. Almost half of all frequently touched items in the home, including chopping boards, are contaminated with harmful bacteria including E.coli. Dr Lisa Ackerley, food hygiene expert and Global Hygiene Council representative, said: 'In all surveys I have ever done focusing on the home, chopping boards come out really badly, the reason being because people don't clean them properly. This infographic reveals the hidden dangers lurking on your chopping board. A survey revealed the average chopping board has around 200 per cent more faecal bacteria on it than the average toilet seat . 'People pay lots of attention to the toilet, using lots of disinfectant and think that is the dirtiest place in the house. 'But nearly every study I have been a part of, it is the kitchen where the most dangerous bacteria lurks. 'Raw meat, raw vegetables and poultry are the culprits. 'People aren't aware that the organisms are invisible, and so people aren't taking the necessary precautions to protect themselves. 'The first thing is to understand where your enemy is. 'Raw meat, vegetables and poultry harbour E.coli, salmonella and Campylobacter bacteria - more than 60 per cent of raw chicken contains Campylobacter bacteria. The Hygiene Council advises using disinfectant wipes on kitchen surfaces . 'Basically if you have raw chicken in your home, you are likely to have Campylobacter bacteria. 'The best approach is to assume all raw meat and vegetables pose a risk.' Dr Ackerley said a few years ago an outbreak of E.coli left experts baffled, until they discovered the common link was leeks and potatoes. Around 250 people were affected, suffering violent food poisoning. 'You tend to eat those vegetables cooked,' she told MailOnline. 'But it is easy to forget that these root vegetables were pulled from the ground and so were covered in organisms and bacteria from the ground. 'This is especially the case for organic vegetables, which have been fertilised in animal manure. 'If you wash them in the sink, you can transfer the bacteria to your hands and the washing up bowl. 'So it is vital people wash their hands properly after preparing them.' Describing the 'journey of the germ', Dr Ackerley explained how bacteria, which is harmless in one place, makes it to the gut where it becomes dangerous, threatening to trigger food poisoning. She said organisms are picked up on a person's hand and when they fail to wash their hands properly, the bacteria can be spread quickly through the home, landing on any surface a person touches. 'Some of these bacteria are very infectious, even in small numbers,' she said. 'Just a few organisms on a person's hand can be transferred to door handles, tea towels, cloths and other surfaces where they multiply quickly. 'If someone else comes along and touches the contaminated surfaces, they can pick up the bacteria, and if they then eat something with their hands, could be at risk of food poisoning. 'The simple act of really washing your hands properly will really destroy most bacteria and stop it spreading. 'As few as 500 Campylobacter bacteria or just 10 E.coli organisms can cause food poisoning. You would need to have millions of E.coli in one place before you could see them.' Dr Ackerley said while many people just 'swill' their hands in warm water, it is not sufficient to kill harmful bacteria. In fact, it is the act of rubbing your hands together that will rid them of the bacteria, rather than the hot water killing it off. 'To kill bacteria you need water much hotter than it is bearable to touch,' she told MailOnline. 'It is the rubbing action of washing your hands that rids your hands of the bacteria. 'The water doesn't kill it off but rubbing your hands together for longer than 20 seconds and really getting under the nails will remove the organisms. 'If I really manhandle chicken, like if I am marinading it, I will always wash my hands twice. Anti-bacterial hand wash really helps too.' But she said as important as washing your hands, is disinfecting all kitchen utensils and surfaces after preparing raw meat and vegetables. For some utensils the dishwasher is the best option, as long as the wash is at least 65°C, Dr Ackerley said. But for surfaces and chopping boards, it is important to use disinfectant, she added. 'A lot of Government advice suggests having different coloured chopping boards for meat and veg, but in reality that doesn't happen,' she said. 'The only way to control bacteria and stop the spread is to use disinfectant. If you can touch it, disinfect it, just using water won't kill the bacteria.' Washing up without using disinfectant merely transfers and spreads the bacteria from the chopping board to washing up brush or cloth and tea towel. The only fail safe way to combat these organisms is to use the dishwasher or disinfectant, she added. And when it comes to kitchen cloths, Dr Ackerley said the only way to ensure they are safe is to put them through the washing machine, or boil them in water everyday. She said: 'The reason your kitchen cloth smells is because it is infested with bacteria. 'Seventy-five per cent of kitchen cloths have traces of E.coli, so either bin them each day or make sure you wash them at a high temperature everyday.' But she said, people do not have to 'completely panic'. 'This isn't about having a major deep clean every day, rather targeted cleaning,' she reassured. 'Cleaning the right place at the right time and avoiding touching things like raw meat and vegetables as much as possible.' She said when preparing chicken, for example, she uses a fork to chop it up and transfer it straight to the pan, before immediately disinfecting and cleaning the utensils she has used. 'That way I am avoiding transferring any bacteria around my home,' she said. The Hygiene Council advises using disinfectant wipes, such as Dettol anti-bacterial surface wipes, on chopping boards as they eliminate 99.9 per cent of bacteria.","New survey reveals 40% of all food poisoning cases are caused by poor hygiene in the home .

"Business is booming in Colorado's mountain resorts, and the addition of recreational marijuana stores this year has attracted customers curious about legalized pot. But there's mounting anxiety that ski towns have embraced stoner culture a little too much, potentially damaging the state's tourism brand. That worry flared up in two resort towns last week. In Breckenridge, residents voted overwhelmingly to force downtown's lone dispensary off Main Street to a less-visible location. And just up the road in Granby, town officials used a property annex to prevent the first dispensary from opening there. The fear is that some families — a mainstay of the ski tourism industry — will stop vacationing here. Pack up: Last week, residents in Breckenridge, Colorado voted to move this dispensary off Main Street to a less-visible location . Bad for business? Colorado's number two industry is tourism, and those in the business fear that the legalization of pot could have an impact on families vacationing in the state. Above, a picture of skiers and snowboarders eating lunch at the base of Breckenridge on December 11, 2014 . 'It's not a morality issue, or that we think marijuana is bad,' said Breckenridge councilman Gary Gallagher, who supported legal marijuana but also voted to force the Breckenridge Cannabis Club out of downtown. 'Marijuana, it is not in this country's DNA yet. It's a little bit too early.' So far, there's no indication that legal pot has damaged tourism, Colorado's number two industry. The state notched a record $17.3 billion in tourism spending the year after legalization, with a record 64.6 million visitors, and state tourism officials say 2014 is poised to top last year's record. But it's an open question whether pot has anything to do with it. Officials cite the improving economy and the weather, with healthy snow totals historically being the most significant driver for mountain visits. The state and its marijuana industry are barred by law from advertising weed out of state, and the head of the Colorado Tourism Office says the state isn't tracking the role of marijuana in tourist behavior. 'It's all anecdotal,' Al White said. 'I have heard from some angry parents who said they'll never come back to Colorado because of marijuana. And I've also heard from people who say they came to Colorado just to see the marijuana. Safe haven: However, legalization is also driving tourism to the state.  A report in july found that 90 per cent of recreational marijuana sales in mountain resort communitites were made by out-of-state visitors. Above, two customers from Texas smell strains of marijuana at the Breckenridge Cannabis club last Thursday . 'Too soon': Moving the Cannabis Club off Main Street, was not a 'morality' issue, Breckenridge councilman Gary Gallagher said. 'Marijuana, it is not in this country's DNA yet. It's a little bit too early.' Above, a pot store employee talks with customers inside the soon-to-move out Breckenridge Cannabis Club . 'At the end of the day, it may be having a modest effect, but it's not huge either way.' The recent friction isn't the first time officials have moved to lower marijuana's profile. The nation's largest ski operator, Vail Resorts, made headlines over the last year tearing down makeshift shelters built illicitly in hard-to-reach areas and used by stoners to 'get safe,' mountain slang for toking up out of the cold and away from ski patrollers. Resorts across the state are dotted with the so-called smoke shacks, and some of them are decades old. 'We will continue to communicate that consumption of marijuana is illegal in public and on federal land,' Vail Resorts' Russ Pecoraro said in a statement about destroying the shacks in its four areas, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge, Keystone and Vail. Still, at rates greater than their urban neighbors, mountain communities backed marijuana legalization in 2012, including Breckenridge, an early and enthusiastic support base, and there's no doubt that recreational pot has had an effect on ski towns. Shhh: Colorado is not allowed to advertise legalized marijuana outside the state, but out-of-towners are allowed to but it when they travel there. Above, snowboarders ride a lift at Breckenridge, in Colorado . Any change? The state has yet to conduct a report studying the impact of tourism since the legalization of marijuana. Above, this December 11, 2014 photo shows skiers and snowboarders take a run at Breckenridge . Support base: The resort towns were overwhelmingly in favor of legalization when the issue came to  a vote in 2012. In this December 11, 2014 photo, snowboarders ride a lift at Breckenridge, in Colorado. A state-produced July report on the new marijuana industry concluded that 90 per cent of recreational sales in mountain resort communities go to out-of-state visitors. The influx of shoppers - and camera crews that have become frequent sights as they work on pot-themed news stories and documentaries - has prompted a lively debate among residents about how pot is changing their resorts. 'Whether you're pro-marijuana or against marijuana, you have to be concerned about how tourists react to seeing it,' said Bob Gordman, a Breckenridge retiree who voted to move the dispensary. Others say the marijuana novelty will die down naturally and that resort towns shouldn't worry about dispensaries or the souvenir shops that put 'Rocky Mountain High' puns on T-shirts. 'In five or 10 years, it'll be no big issue,' said Bill Kiser, a Breckenridge retiree who voted to keep the dispensary on Main Street. 'Why don't families get turned off when they go on vacation and see a bar and people drinking alcohol? Because they're used to it,' Kiser said. 'People will eventually get used to this, too.'","Residents in Breckenridge, Colorado voted in favor of forcing the town's lone dispensary off Main Street to a less-visible location last week .

"A rare variety of butter favored by famed chef Thomas Keller can now be yours - for a whopping $49 per pound. Animal Farm butter, which is produced by Diane St Clair in Orwell, Vermont, is made using the cream from her ten Jersey cows, which contains over 87per cent butterfat. It's cultured for 24 hours with buttermilk from the farm, churned by hand into a deep yellow, and then kneaded by hand to work the fats. Fancy spread: Animal Farm butter, a rare variety of butter favored by famed chef Thomas Keller, can now be yours - for a whopping $49 per pound . While the majority of the butter is delivered to Mr Keller's restaurants, The French Laundry in California and New York's Per Se, a surplus is now being sent to Saxelby Cheesemongers in Manhattan, where non-chefs can purchase it in quarter-pound nubs. Saxelby is being provided with a limited supply of Animal Farm butter for just a few weeks in December, while French Laundry takes a seasonal break from business. According to GrubStreet, the creamy butter sold at Saxelby comes sealed and unsalted in a 'completely unglamorous Ziploc bag'. Ms St Clair, who started making butter on Animal Farm over ten years ago, produces just 100lbs of butter a week, ten months of the year, making the product extremely rare and precious. Painstaking process: The butter is made from the cream of Jersey cows, cultured with buttermilk from the farm, churned by hand into a deep yellow, and then kneaded by hand to work the fats . Other than the shipments to Chef Keller's eateries, some of it is also sent to Chef Barbara Lynch's Boston restaurants, Menton and No 9 Park, well as to The Inn at Little Washington, in Virginia, owned by Chef Patrick O'Connell. In a 2013 interview with the Napa Valley Register, Ms St Clair revealed that her butter caught the attention of Chef Thomas Keller after she sent him a sample and asked for his opinion. The chef reportedly responded with: 'Who are you? It's the most amazing butter I ever tasted.' What's more, he was so taken with the butter that he bought her entire inventory at the time, without even asking the cost. Big fan: Famed Chef Thomas Keller was originally so taken with the butter that he bought her entire inventory, without even asking the cost. Now he serves is at French Laundry (pictured) and Per Se . Ever since then,  he has continued to server Animal Farm butter at both of his Michelin-starred restaurants. Ms St Clair recently published a recipe book about how to use the butter and buttermilk from her dairy farm, and Chef Barbara Lynch offered a rave review. 'The first time I tasted Diane's butter, I was blown away,' she wrote in an endorsement of the book. 'And when I later sampled her buttermilk, it was a revelation - gorgeous globs of that golden butter suspended in creamy, tangy buttermilk. Of course, I wanted to put it in everything'.","Animal Farm butter, produced by Diane St Clair in Orwell, Vermont, is made using the cream from Jersey cows, which contains over 87% butterfat .

"A Nazi guide to Christmas - in which the Virgin Mary becomes German and the Archangel Gabriel is turned into an Ayran goddess - has been unearthed in an archive in the city of Dresden. As well as listing precise instructions for decorating the Christmas tree, faithful yuletide revellers were to be ordered told to ditch Christmas carols in favour of more 'Germanic' ditties extolling motherhood, harvests and nature. They include melodies which went: 'A mother enters into the world alone and is as tired as a stone: but a tree grows tall, aloof, and soon becomes her sheltering roof.' Christmas the Nazi way: Adolf Hitler meets not one, but two, Santa Clauses during a Christmas party given by the Chief of the Chancellery in Berlin in 1937 . The 20 page instruction leaflet for party members was produced in November 1937 by the Heimatwerk organisation of the Saxony branch of the Nazi Party. The Heimatwerk was formed the previous year and billed itself as the promoter of 'Saxon Germanic culture as a shining example of true Germanness.' It was never intended for publication but distributed to party functionaries to see that the population buckled down to the new way of doing things. The Nazi guide to Christmas starts off by telling followers that 'no festival is as German as Christmas' and then gives instructions about how many baubles should be placed on the tree. The swastika is 'firmly recommended' to replace a fairy or an angel at the top. Because Nazism viewed organised religion as a competitor - and therefore an enemy - of the movement, its disciples were told that it wasn't really a Christian celebration at all. Evil at work: Adolf Hitler sits with other Nazi Party officials at a Christmas party for Waffen SS officer cadets at the Lowenbraukeller, Munich, Germany, December 18, 1941 . Following instructions: The 1941 Nazi Christmas party was decorated with golden swastikas on the walls . The 20-page instruction leaflet from 1937 teaches Nazis that Virgin Mary is German and how to decorate the perfect Hitler Christmas tree (pictured is Waffen SS officer cadets during the 1941 NSDAP Christmas party) The manuscript goes on: 'The festival has been introduced against the wishes of the Church. Priests had to to reinterpret it in a Christian light, in their favour, later on. The deep mystery of the German Christmas can only be understood by those who feel its originality and authenticity.' This was part of the Nazi hijacking of Christmas, turning it into a form of pagan worship in which Germanic myth and legends became central to the celebrations. 'Maria is the German mother,' says the manuscript,' 'and Jesus Santa Claus is no longer located in the crib, but will be relocated in a cradle to stand for the constant renewal of the German people.' Thus it was not the Three Wise Men 'but the German workers and peasants who flock to him!' said the guide discovered in the archives of the Institute of Saxon History and Folklore in Dresden. Presents, parents were advised, should be part of a game of hide-and-seek so that the 'entire festival will be celebrated without Christ, but as a Germanic-fertility jubilee.' In the run up to the big day, it advised, the Nativity pageant should be replaced in schools and kindergartens with 'fairy tale performances that put a German stamp on the history of Christ's birthday.' Hitler, who was the Messiah to so many Germans, was indeed to become the new God of the German people. A prayer was suggested for the family to say together: 'We spent Christmas in the field, during combat, with the Germans. One was always with us... He is still with us. We greet him!' Him is not meant to be Jesus, but Hitler, the 'Saviour of the Germans.'","'Nazi guide to Christmas' leaflet uncovered in Dresden, Germany .

"Oskar Groening faces charges relating to a two-month period between May and July 1944 . Authorities have confirmed that a former S.S. guard charged in September with participating in the mass murder of 300,000 people at the Auschwitz concentration camp during WW2 is fit to stand trial for his crimes. Oskar Groening, 93, will go into the dock in the spring of next year, the only one of a 'dirty dozen' former camp personnel identified and charged over participation in the Holocaust in the past two years who will actually answer for his crimes. The others were told that their cases were being dropped because of age, infirmity or lack of clear evidence. The court in the northern city of Lueneburg did not identify the accused who will be tried on charges of being an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people. But it is known to be Groening who was employed at the Nazi concentration camp in occupied Poland where an estimated 1.2 million people were liquidated between September 1942 and October 1944. Prosecutors from Hanover are charged with preparing the indictment against Groening, who was in charge of counting, collating and shipping back to the Reich the money and possessions of those murdered in the gas chambers of Hitler's premier extermination camp. The charges relate to a two-month period between May and July 1944, when an estimated 137 trains arrived at the camp carrying 425,000 people, mostly from Hungary. At least 300,000 of them were murdered immediately. 'The accused knew that, as part of the selection process, those not chosen for work and told they were going to the showers were really going to the gas chambers where they would be put to death in an agonizing manner,' the court said in a previous statement issued in September. Some 16 survivors or relatives of survivors have come forward, the court said, and eight have been accepted as witnesses. Groening was in charge of counting, collating and shipping back to the Reich the money and possessions of those murdered in the gas chambers of Auschwitz . News of the case comes a week after a court in Cologne threw out a case against a former SS soldier who prosecutors said was involved at the 1944 massacre of over 600 villagers in the French village of Oradour-sur-Glane. Groening has openly talked about his time as a guard at Auschwitz but claims that while he witnessed atrocities, he didn't commit any himself. He has spoken in the past of witnessing terrible things at the camp. Oskar Groening, now 93, will go into the dock in the spring of next year to face charges relating to 1944 . Once on 'ramp duty' - the place where the doomed Jews were sorted after arrival into those who would live to work and those who would be immediately gassed - he heard a baby crying. 'I saw another SS soldier grab the baby by the legs...' he said. 'He smashed the baby's head against the iron side of a truck until it was silent.' He added: 'Every night and every day I remember it for the nightmare it was. It was in 1942 that my SS chiefs in Berlin ordered me there. 'I was an official in the prisoners' possessions administration which basically involved removing the money, jewels and other valuables from the inmates, registering it and sending it back to Berlin. 'They had diamonds and gold worth millions and it was my duty to make sure all of it got to Berlin. 'Down the years I have heard the cries of the dead in my dreams and in every waking moment. I will never be free of them.' 'It was completely understood by all that the majority were going straight to the gas chamber, although some believed they were only going to be showered before going to work. Many Jews knew they were going to die. 'On one night in January 1943 I saw for the first time how the Jews were actually gassed. It was in a half-built farmyard near to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. A gas chamber was built there. We were searching the wood nearby for prisoners who had escaped. A picture taken just after the liberation by the Soviet army in January 1945 shows a group of children wearing concentration camp uniforms behind barbed wire fencing in the Auschwitz Nazi concentration camp . 'There were more than 100 prisoners and soon there were panic-filled cries as they were herded into the chamber and the door was shut. 'Then a sergeant with a gas mask went to a hole in the wall and from a tin shook Zyklon B gas pellets inside. In that moment the cries of the people inside rose to a crescendo, a choir of madness. These cries I have ringing in my ears to this day. 'This guilt will never leave me. I can only plead for forgiveness and pray for atonement,' he said .

"Returning to Earth from orbit is no easy feat. To do so, spacecraft must endure temperatures of more than 1,650°C (3,000°F) as they hit the atmosphere at 25 times the speed of sound. Thankfully, over the years the technique has been refined to a tee; astronauts can get from the ISS to the surface of Earth in just 3.5 hours. But a GIF has revealed the fiery process that takes place when the manned Soyuz spacecraft first comes into contact with the thick atmosphere - before it makes its daring descent back to Earth. Scroll down for video . This GIF shows the moment cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky, and astronaut Michael Hopkins, returned to Earth in March this year at the culmination of ISS Expedition 38 . Up to three crew members can return to Earth at any one time in one of the Soyuz TMA spacecraft. This is why the ISS has a crew of six. Three people are taken there and back every six months, with crews of three overlapping with each other so that the same crew doesn’t all depart at the same time. The GIF shows the moment the ablative heat shield of the Soyuz begins to bear the brunt of the temperatures of re-entry. On 23 November 2014 a Russian rocket blasted off to deliver three new crew members to the International Space Station - including Italy's first female astronaut. Soyuz TMA-15M, holding incoming station commander Terry Virts, with the US space agency Nasa, left the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazahkstan. Also on board for the lift-off at 3am local time (Sunday 9pm GMT) was Soyuz commander Anton Shkaplerov, with the Russian Federal Space Agency. Ablative means that it ‘burns up’ on re-entry to dissipate heat away from the cabin and keep the astronauts safe. But aside from a small amount of manouevring, there is not much for the astronauts to do during re-entry - except to sit and hope. 'There's not much an astronaut can do as their module re-enters Earth atmosphere but strap in, hold on tight and put their faith in years of proven science and technology,' Ben Biggs, Editor of All About Space Magazine, told MailOnline. 'That can hardly be much consolation though: the temperature on the outside of their high speed spacecraft can be hot enough to melt iron due to friction with the Earth's atmosphere, while the effect of deceleration can be greater than seven times Earth gravity. 'Humans are better able to withstand g-forces perpendicular to the spine, which is why these astronauts are on their backs for re-entry.' The Soyuz (shown) is actually composed of three elements end-to-end - the Orbital Module (top left), the Descent Module (middle) and the Instrumentation/Propulsion Module (bottom right) As it makes its way through the atmosphere (shown), the capsule is subjected to intense temperature, which burn away the ablative heat shield on board - as it is designed to do. Ablative means that it ‘burns up’ on re-entry to dissipate heat away from the cabin and keep the astronauts safe . Expedition 38 returned to Earth on 11 March 2014 (shown) in the snowy reaches of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan after a six-month stay aboard the ISS . Here the three-man crew of the mission are seen on the ground after exiting from the Descent Module. Their journey back to Earth lasted about 3.5 hours in total . The Soyuz is actually composed of three elements end-to-end - the Orbital Module, the Descent Module and the Instrumentation/Propulsion Module. The crew occupies the central part, while the other two are jettisoned before re-entry and burn up in the atmosphere. On their way to the station the Orbital Module provides additional living space, and also contains the systems required to dock with the ISS, including a hatch and docking mechanism. The Instrumentation/Propulsion Module, as its name might suggest, allows the spacecraft to rendezvous with the station after launch. On returning to Earth, it places the Soyuz into a deorbit burn, an angle of entry that will bring it back to Earth, before being jettisoned. However, in the Descent Module the crew also have a guidance, navigation and control system - so they do have some aspect of control when they have separated from the other two elements. Conditions inside the module can be quite cramped. The astronauts have some degree of control over the spacecraft, but otherwise must trust the science and technology on board . Just a split second before landing, six solid-fueled soft-landing engines fire (shown), dampening the impact by decreasing the speed to just 9.8ft (three metres) per second . During the re-entry procedure, the Soyuz begins by undocking from the ISS and then performing a 15-second separation burn. When it is 7.5 miles (12km) behind the ISS, it begins the deorbit burn, which slows it down by about 375 feet (115 metres) per second. Then, three hours after undocking and just minutes from re-entry, it pyrotechnically separates the Orbital and Instrumentation/Propulsion module. This begins the fiery entry process, during which the crew are unable to communicate with ground control. Then, at a height of about 5.6 miles (nine kilometres), a drogue chute slows the Soyuz from 785 to 295 feet (240 to 90 metres) per second. The main chute then deploys at an altitude of 4.6 miles (7.5km), slowing the Soyuz to 20 feet (six metres) per second. Next, the heat shield is jettisoned, exposing the underside of the spacecraft, which contains the landing engines. And finally, just a split second before landing, six solid-fueled soft-landing engines fire, dampening the impact by decreasing the speed to just three metres per second. Shock abosrbers in the seats also dampen the landing for the astronauts on board, before the entry module hatch is opened and they climb out to the landing crew awaiting them.","The return of three astronauts to Earth is shown from inside Soyuz capsule .

"The ex-wife of Sydney terrorist Man Haron Monis sought refuge in the US before she was stabbed to death, it has been revealed . The ex-wife of Sydney terrorist Man Haron Monis sought refuge in the US before she was stabbed to death, it has been revealed. The self-styled sheikh was shot dead in a firefight at the end of Monday's cafe siege which also resulted in the death of two hostages. Today the relatives of his ex-wife Noleen Pal, said that she escaped to San Francisco from her abusive husband just months before she was stabbed 18 times and set alight outside her apartment in April 2013. Ayyut Khalik, Pal’s godfather, told NBC News Monis became both physically and emotionally abusive towards Pal after she gave birth to the couple’s first child - they have two sons under ten. Khalik said just over a year ago the 30-year-old fled to his home in Hayward, where it is understood have mother also lives nearby. He said Monis  forced her to wear a hijab at all times and forbid her from contact with non-Muslims. 'We found out he was hitting her and stuff, and he was telling his kids white people are bad,' he said. Missing her children she returned to Australia after a month-long stay in America. But less than six months later she died in a brutal killing when she was set upon, stabbed repeatedly, doused with accelerant and then set alight in an apartment building stairwell. At the time, Monis and Pal were involved in a bitter custody battle over their children. Documents allege that he threatened to shoot Pal at Minchinbrook McDonalds in western Sydney almost two years before she was murdered. Scroll down for video . Today the relatives of Noleen Pal (right) in America, told CBS San Francisco station KPIX-TV that she sought refuge in San Francisco from her abusive husband, left,  just months before she died after she was repeatedly stabbed and set on fire . Murder scene: This is the Werrington apartment in western Sydney where Man Haron Monis was living and where Noleen Hayson Pal was set alight and stabbed to death in April 2013 . According to an interview conducted at St Marys Police Station on July 27, 2011, Monis threatened Pal after they split up and had demanded full custody of their children, then aged seven and three-and-a-half. Pal, who told police she was afraid of Monis, had met him at the McDonald's a week earlier to discuss custody of their children. Police say Monis told her, 'If I can't see the kids more than I am now, you're going to pay, even if I have to shoot you'. Monis also told polce that he was a former 'security officer in Australia' and that he had previously held a firearm licence and and gone target shooting. It was not until seven months later, in October 2013, that police arrested and charged Monis's girlfriend, Amirah Droudis with murder and charged Monis with accessory to murder before and after the fact. On December 12 last year, the pair applied for bail on the accessory to murder and murder charges. Ayyut Khalik, (pictured) Pal’s godfather, told NBC News Monis became physically abusive towards Pal after she gave birth to the couple’s first child - they are believed to have two sons under ten . Evidence given during a bail hearing in Penrith Local Court said a witness saw Pal having fluid poured on her and set alight by a woman wearing a 'black cape' and a headscarf, the Daily Telegraph reported. The court heard that Monis went to 'extreme and elaborate lengths' to create an alibi for himself, placing himself at a Penrith pool immediately before the murder and deliberately and faking a car crash outside Penrith Police station following the murder, after which he claimed he had chest pains and was taken to Nepean Hospital. The lawyer who acted for both Monis and Ms Droudis last December, Manny Conditsis, told Daily Mail Australia the pair had been granted bail because the charges of accessory to murder and murder were based on 'circumstantial' evidence. Mr Conditsis said Monis had spent around 12 weeks in total in custody for the accessory to murder and the sexual assault charges and that during that time in prison he had been tortured by being made to stand up and having 'excrement' put on him in his cell. Pal's mother, Momina Khalik, has also posted on her Facebook page her anger over Monis's bail conditions, saying: 'They should have let him rot in the jail his a f***en sick animal'. Monis's partner, Amirah Droudis, has been helping police with their investiagation into the Sydney cafe siege . Amirah Droudis arrives at a police station in western Sydney, as investigators searched her home . Today Pal's brother Talat Khalik spoke of his anger that Monis was allowed out on bail despite facing charges over the murder of his sister. Speaking from his home in California, he told ITV News: 'It could have been avoided if the system was right over there. I was happy that he's going to burn in hell. 'Guys like that shouldn't be able to walk along anywhere in this world.' Mr Khalik said his thoughts were also with the families of hostages Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson who died in the bloody climax to the 17-hour siege. 'The other two people that lost their lives, we feel bad for their families, too,' he added. 'We know what they are going through.' Police raid the home in Belmore, in Western Sydney, where Man Haron Monis was thought to be living . Mr Khalik had yesterday posted pictures of his sister on Facebook after Monis was revealed as the hostage-taker with the message: 'F****** lucky tey got u before we did. Now rest in hell f****** asshole'. Investigating officers are attempting to delve deeper into the mind of the madman who has already proved to be a thorn in the side of the authorities since he arrived in Australia from Iran nearly 20 years ago. Court documents show that the dead gunman behind the siege of a Sydney cafe was facing up to 50 sexual offence charges, including aggravated sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault and inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act. Man Haron Monis massaged women's breasts and rubbed his genitals against them before raping them in 'spiritual healing' sessions all over Sydney going back 13 years, the documents allege. He committed the sexual offences against women at his Spiritual Consultation business in the Sydney suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between September 2001 and September this year, according to the documents. Monis, whose name is recorded in the documents as Mohammad Hassas Manteghi, was due to face court on February 27 next year. The house where Man Haron Monis spent time with his partner Amirah Droudis . The partner of Sydney terror siege gunman Man Haron Monis posted a series of hate-filled videos in which she described herself as a terrorist and expressed happiness at the 9/11 and 2002 Bali terror attacks and the Holocaust. Amirah Droudis, 35, appeared in public Tuesday just hours after Monis was shot dead by police to end a 17-hour siege in which he held hostages at a central Sydney cafe. Droudis reported to Campsie Police Station in southwestern Sydney as required under conditions of her bail for the alleged murder of Monis's ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal, who was stabbed multiple times and set alight in April 2013. Monis was also charged in connection to the murder. Four years before the killing, a woman believed to be Droudis posted a series of chilling videos on YouTube in which she described acts of terrorism as God's will. The videos bear the address of Monis's website. 'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore,' says the woman in one of the videos, whose face is mostly covered by a niqab. The video provoked a media storm at the time they were first posted, but no charges were laid. His mental state had been discussed by Australian and Iranian officials several times before the siege in Sydney according to Iran's foreign ministry, AAP reported. According to Iran's Fars news agency Australia had also denied an attempt to extradite Monis to Iran, where he been indicted for fraud. It also emerged that Monis had apparently posted a series of hate-filled rants online which grew increasingly extreme in the days leading up to his terrorist attack. The self-styled fake sheikh took to Twitter to vent his anger at Australia's foreign policy of sending troops off to fight overseas. On December 10, just five days before he stormed the Lindt cafe with a sawn-off shotgun, he raged: 'Shame on Team Australia and shame on those racist and terrorist Australians who support the governments of'. The theme is similar to that of a letter addressed to Tony Abbott and posted on his website a year ago, saying the country's foreign policy meant 'Australia and Australians will be attacked'. On the Thursday before the siege, he complained about 'death threats on his page 'based on religious hate' and then praises Australian Muslims for choosing 'Team Islam'. He railed against former prime minister Kevin Rudd for criticising him and the fact he was 'for five years on bail conditions' following his conviction for sending vile hate letters to the families of Australian soldiers who died fighting in Afghanistan. The Twitter account appears to be genuine, although his Tweets are linked to a Facebook page which has been pulled down.

Evil countdown: Five days before he stormed the Lindt cafe armed with a shotgun, Man Haron Monis lashed out at 'racist and terrorist Australians' who supported 'Team Australia' and Tony Abbott's foreign policy .

"The Obamas are packing their bags for their annual holiday vacation to Hawaii, scheduled to last 17 days this year. The first family will leave Washington, D.C. on Friday for the president's native state and won't return until Jan. 4, the White House has said. It is not yet known where they stay this year, though they have traditionally rented out a property on Oahu island. During their year-end trips to the Hawaiian islands the Obamas typically lounge around their rental home, venturing out only on occasion for  shaved ice and dinner with their friends. First Lady Michelle Obama revealed on Monday that it's her Christmas wish to spend this year's holiday sleeping in late. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama are pictured here making their annual trip to speak with current and retired members of the U.S. military and their families as they eat a Christmas Day meal in the Anderson Hall mess hall at Marine Corps Base Hawaii on December 25, 2013 in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. The first family will be vacationing in the Hawaiian Islands again this year, leaving on Friday and returning on Jan. 4 . President Obama walks with his daughters Malia, tp his left, and Sasha, to his right, while they and his friend Marty Nesbitt, back right, walk to their car after a visit to Sea Life Park on December 27, 2011 at Waimanalo, Hawaii. This year will be their seventh year vacationing in Hawaii for Christmas . The Obamas, including dogs Bo and more recently Sunny, have spent every Christmas since Barack was elected to president visiting the his birth place, Honolulu, which is coincidentally located in the beautiful Hawaiian islands. For the past three years they have stayed on the most populous island, Oahu, in the wealthy Kailua neighborhood. In addition to culinary excursions the president generally spends his time on the golf course or working out at a local Marine Corps base. He and the first lady usually make a special trip to the base to to wish the troops stationed there a Merry Christmas and to thank them for their service, as well. Last year the Obama family also went on two hikes, two beach trips, a snorkeling expedition and visited the Honolulu zoo during their 17-day trip. Their six previous trips have lasted between two and two and a half weeks and cost taxpayers roughly $4 million, government watchdogs have estimated, even with the Obamas paying for their own accommodations, which cost them $56,000 in 2013. Taxpayers picked up the tab for as at least seven other homes in the area that Secret Service and White House staff stayed in, however. A 2012 trip cost even more - $7 million - Watchdog.org found, after the president accompanied his family to Honolulu, Hawaii, for five days, then rushed back to Washington to help negotiate a deal to keep the country from falling off the 'fiscal cliff.' After spending several days at the White House, Obama then returned to Hawaii to pick up his family and finish out his vacation. Earlier this year the president's two-week vacation to Martha's Vineyard was interrupted by a series of domestic and international crises and the president ended up having to work on many days set aside for relaxation on the Massachusetts island. He also returned to Washington, D.C. for two days during that getaway, without his wife, for meetings at the White House. This year's winter vacation promises to be much less stressful, as Congress has already approved a $1.1 trillion appropriations bill to fund the government through the end of this fiscal year. President Obama buys a a shaved ice from Island Snow at Kailua Beach Center in Kailua, Hawaii, on December 31, 2013. The Obamas traditionally treat themselves to snow cones during their yearly vacation to the president's birth state . A favorite past time of Obama both at home an on vacation in Hawaii is golfing. He is pictured here shaking hands with the crowd gathered at the 18th green after playing a round at the Mid Pacific Country Club in Kailua, Hawaii on December 29, 2008 a month and a half after being elected president . The first lady said on Monday that she's looking forward to getting a good night's sleep while on her upcoming holiday. Obama was at the Washington, D.C. medical center to read children the classic Christmas tale Twas the Night Before Christmas and to answer their questions on Monday when a patient asked her what she wanted this year, according to CBS News. 'I don’t really have a long wish list for Christmas, because I pretty much have everything I need,' she responded. 'I just want everybody to be happy, and I want to sleep in. That’s what I want for Christmas. I want to sleep late. Maybe I’ll get that,' she continued. After the first lady's initial answer another child inquired as to whether she had Christmas-themed sleepwear. 'Maybe that’s what I should put on my Christmas list,' Mrs. Obama said told the group that had gathered to listen to her read at Children’s National Health System hospital. 'OK, Mr. President, if you’re watching, I think we could use some Christmas pajamas. That’s a good idea,' she said. Earlier that day her husband had admitted that he struggles with buying her gifts she'll like - particularly clothes - while talking to radio and TV personality Ryan Seacrest . 'Michelle is hard to shop for,' he told the American Idol host during a radio interview that was taped Friday but aired on Monday. 'She's very fashionable and she looks good,,' he said, per USA Today. 'So I'm worried about buying her clothes because she'll, on Christmas Day, look at it and say, ""That's really sweet, honey,""  and peck me on the cheek -- and I never see her wear what I bought.'","'I just want everybody to be happy, and I want to sleep in.

"Burt Reynolds' personal memorabilia, including the infamous Smokey and the Bandit Trans Am car, fetched more than $2.5 million at a Las Vegas auction. More than 600 items, including his 1998 Golden Globe for Boogie Nights and the canoe made for his movie Deliverance were up for sale. The 78-year-old star strongly denied speculation that he was selling the collection because he was bankrupt saying before the sale, 'I want everyone to know that contrary to what all the news outlets are saying, I am not broke.' Instead he said his house has become a shrine to himself. Scroll down for video . Denial: Burt Reynolds has said that he is not in any financial difficulties and simply wanted to offload a lot of clutter he has collected during his career . The iconic Trans Am car from the Smokey and the Bandit movies fetched $450,000, the highest price paid at the auction . 'I have been dealing with a business dispute for many years as well as a divorce settlement,' he said. 'I am simply selling some of my memorabilia that I have enjoyed for so many years but no have use nor room for them anymore.' 'Quite frankly, I am sick of so many picture of myself in my own home.'

"A photographer has embarked on a journey to capture the remaining rest stops on the roadsides of America before they vanish from existence. Ryann Ford, 32, from Austin, Texas, United States, has spent the last five years driving across America to capture 'humble' rest stops. Her journey has seen photograph over 150 rest stops, while driving over 20,000 miles across 17 states. A photographer has embarked on a journey to capture the remaining rest stops on the roadsides of America before they vanish; pictured here is a stop near Big Bend National Park, Texas . The White Sands National Monument, New Mexico offers passers-by incredible views of the landscape . Each of the rest-stops display a very inque style of architecture; here is a stop near Sonora, Texas . 'My inspiration was the structures themselves,' said Miss Ford. 'I am a big fan of mid-century architecture and can usually spot it when I see it. When I moved to Texas, eight years ago, and started noticing these old stops set out on gorgeous minimalist landscapes, I was instantly inspired. 'There are tables shaded by faux oil rigs, teepees and wagon wheels, and geometric shapes echoing classic mid-century design. They are a really great example of Americana.' The results of her documentation show that rest stops vary in design and usually take influences from the state, town or city. Astop near Clines Corners, New Mexico might be a good place to shield yourself from any extreme weather conditions . This stop near Austin, Nevada looks like it could become more like a sauna should the sun reach full strength . This resting place in Abiquiu, New Mexico is dwarfed by snow-covered mountains in the background . Miss Ford said: 'think people will learn how historically significant these unassuming stops are and I don't think a lot of people realize how unique the design of each stop is until you look at dozens of them at a time. I think most people will also find beauty in something they never expected to when they slow down and take a good look. 'When I started the project I did a little research and was alarmed to read that they were currently being closed and demolished all over the country. I immediately felt an urgency to document as many as I could, as quickly as I could. It was also really interesting to find out how much thought went into these stops. 'When Eisenhower designed the Interstate Highway System in 1956, it standardized highway design from coast to coast. The one element that stayed within the jurisdiction of the states, however, was their rest stop design. States really took advantage of that and used the best architects and designers, and their creativity, to design stops that represented the different regions of their state and their cultural and historical significance.' This stop near Walker Lake, Nevada is of the more simple style, and would just about fit a family of four under cover . It may not have walls, but this stop at Thackerville, Oklahoma does at least have a roof to protect from any rain or snow . This stop at the Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona might not be the prettiest, but it looks of sturdy nature . A stop near Burleson, Texas;  Ryann Ford, 32, from Austin, Texas, US, has spent the last five years driving across America to capture humble rest stops . Miss Ford is now aiming to create a book of all the rest stops, called 'The Last Stop - A Photo Book of America's Rest Stops' by December next year with her project still ongoing. All of the locations will be captioned, along with their GPS coordinates, with plans for a historian to write an essay for the book. Miss Ford, who is sometimes accompanied by her mother on her trips, will continue to document more rest stops into the New Year. She added: 'When I tell people I am working on a project documenting rest stops, a lot of them look at me funny as they are probably picturing dirty toilets and truck drivers. The shade at this stop in Monument Valley, Arizona is just what is needed on the desert landscape that can reach sweltering point . Ryann Ford's journey has seen photograph over 150 rest stops, including this one near Organ, New Mexico, while driving over 20,000 miles across 17 states . You'd better hope there's not too many weary travellers at this stop near Saguaro National Park, Arizona, with space at a premium . Resembling an old-style jail cell, this stop at Juan Santa Cruz Picnic Area,Tucson, Arizona retains a certain style . 'Once I show them a few of the photos though, they get it immediately and love the project. People love to point out which ones they've been to and share their stories and memories of visiting these stops. 'My mom joined me on almost all of the trips. We are great travel buddies and the trips with her were so much fun. She would just sit in a chair and read while I shot the rest stops.'","Ryann Ford, 32, from Austin, Texas, United States, has spent the last five years driving across America .

Just as the shoot was due to end, a passing rider offered to lend Mrs Mahaffey her horse to take a picture on top of, and she happily accepted and went to jump into the saddle. But just as she settled on top of the animal it bolted, running across the beach and sending her crashing headfirst into the sand. Scroll down for video . Bride-to-be Lauren Mahaffey was posing for a pre-wedding photoshoot on a Californian beach when a passerby offered to lend their horse for a picture. However, as Mrs Mahaffey climbed on to the animal it bolted . Eventually Mrs Mahaffey was left face-down in the sand after being thrown off the horse, but despite being bruised went on to pose for more pictures for another half an hour . Groom Joshua Mahaffey was unaware of the accident until his wedding day a few weeks later when he was shown the video, alongside 200 guests, who were left in fits of laughter . Photographer Jarrett Hucks warned against posing with the animal, saying it would be unpredictable, and was soon proved right. He said he was worried for Mrs Mahaffey's safety after the accident, but when he rushed over he found her laughing . The footage was caught on camera by wedding photographer Jarrett Hucks who rushed to bride's aid - only to find her in fits of laughter. Meanwhile the horse continued to buck and nearly knocked over its handler before the owner finally stepped in to bring the situation under control. Groom Joshua Mahaffey knew nothing of the accident until a few weeks later at the wedding when his blushing bride revealed all. Jarrett said: 'My client decided that since you only live once, she wanted to take a photo on top of a horse. I'm not much of a fan of large animals myself because of the unpredictability of them, but I agreed to take the photo if she wanted. Dumped: Mrs Mahaffey lays face-down in the sand on Myrtle Beach, California, with a shoe sitting to one side, after being thrown from a horse while posing for pre-wedding pictures . Shaken: Wedding photographer Mr Hucks said he worried that Mrs Mahaffey was seriously injured after the accident last month, but when he ran over was relived to find her laughing . Despite taking a tumble into the sand Mrs Mahaffey was left with only a few minor bruises, and was even able to finish the shoot . 'Everyone thought it was very funny as soon as we knew she was OK. It was the subject of many laughs on the wedding day. 'I think it scared her as it was happening but when we got to her she was already laughing. She was such a good sport that she posed for another half an hour even though she was a bit bruised. 'The groom was shown the video on the wedding day and I watched the expression on his face. He was pretty shocked but he knew that she was ok and he did see the funny side. 'The video was shown at the evening party to around 200 people, and others have since watched it on the internet.' The wedding photographer who captured the unforgettable moment was Jarrett Hucks. Bad idea: Mrs Mahaffey is pictured hitching up her dress before attempting to climb on to the horse which suddenly made a run for it . Moments from disaster: All still appears calm as Mrs Mahaffey takes the saddle on top of the unruly animal, but moments later it bolted . Terror: Mrs Mahaffey appears to be laughing, or screaming, or a mixture of both as she disappears off camera on top of the horse . There she goes: Mrs Mahaffey holds on in vain as the frightened horse disappears off camera before dumping her on to the beach . Jarrett, who has been a professional wedding photographer for three years, added: 'The horse owner didn't stick around for very long after the bride fell off. I've had a couple of funny things happen on shoots before but none who has had their life in danger. 'This was a really easy-going wedding day. It went really smooth and the weather was great.' The happy couple have now put the horsing around behind them and are enjoying a honeymoon in Hawaii. How it should have looked: Mrs Mahaffey did eventually get a picture with the horse, though decided not to ride it this time around . Stunning: Despite the accident Mrs Mahaffey carried on with the shoot, including this shot, which she showed to her husband on their big day - along with the video of the horse .","Bride-to-be Lauren Mahaffey was posing for pre-wedding pictures for her husband on beach in southern California .

"Michael Strahan has called his divorce 'one of the worst best things that ever happened to me'. The 42-year-old co-host of 'Live! with Kelly and Michael' and former NFL star opened up about his personal life in a special interview with Barbara Walters for ABC. She quizzed him about his two divorces, his first from Wanda Hutchins, with whom he has two adult children, and his second from Jean Muggli, with whom he has 10-year-old twin girls. He said he learned a lot from his famously acrimonious divorce from Muggli, whom he met in 1994 while she worked in a skincare salon in Manhattan. They married in 1999 and divorced in 2005. Scroll down for video . Opening up: Michael Strahan, the co-host of 'Live! with Kelly and Michael', said in an interview that aired on ABC on Sunday that he learned a lot from his divorce to ex-wife Jean Muggli . 'Learning experience': Strahan, who was married to Muggli (right) for six years, said the experience taught him not to care what anybody thought. She had accused him of beating her - but a judge dismissed the claims . 'It was one of the worst/best things that ever happened to me,' he said, adding that media coverage painted him as a cheater one day, then having a gay relationship with a friend the next. When Muggli filed for divorce, she made numerous accusations against him, including that he had beat her, cheated on her and even recorded her sister undressing. A judge ultimately dismissed the claims. 'It let me get to the point where I had to learn not to care what anybody thought,' Strahan explained. 'So I also didn't want to say anything and fight back to the papers because that fed more into it.' He added that it also taught him to focus on what was important: his daughters. 'I had these two little babies and I don't want my little ones to Google when they're older... and say, ""Daddy, why did you say this about mommy?"" I didn't want that.' he explained. 'It was more important for me to take it and deal with it as a father than to put my - to say something that could hurt my kids in the future.' The former New York Giants player also has a 23-year-old daughter, Tanita, and a 20-year-old son, Michael Jr., from his first marriage. Watch more at ABC News . Split: Over the summer, he broke off his five-year engagement to Nicole Murphy, pictured left and right . Focus: Strahan said that he focused on his twin girls, who are now 10, during the tough divorce . He said their mother, Wanda Hutchins, whom he divorced in 1996, is still one of his best friends and continues to give him good advice on relationships. 'We were just kids having kids,' he said. 'For us, we were smart enough to turn that into a great friendship.' Strahan spoke to Walters as part of her '10 Most Fascinating People of 2014' special, which aired on ABC on Sunday night. Most recently, he called off his five-year engagement to Eddie Murphy's ex-wife, Nicole Murphy. The couple split this summer, citing conflicting schedules and distance.","The 'Live! with Kelly and Michael' host spoke about his work and personal life with Barbara Walters for an ABC special .

"They’re among the most fearsome predators in the animal kingdom. Not that one would have guessed it from this display. When a pride of lions became involved in a stand-off with a family of elephants, they quickly decided it was a battle they weren't going to win. One of the lions ended up scrambling up a tree in an effort to escape the charging elephants . A lion lays low (bottom left) as the pride was chased by elephants at Lower Zambezi National Park in Zambia . Instead of putting up a fight, they had no choice but to flee to rampaging elephants, which were attempting to protect one of their young calves. Rose Hipwood, from the Luxury Safari Company, and Kyle Branch, from the Sausage Tree Safari Camp, watched as the event unfolded during a safari trip in the Lower Zambezi National Park in Zambia. Mr Branch said: ‘We spotted the pride of twelve fast asleep in the shade of the winter-thorn trees... a peaceful scene until a herd of elephants with a tiny calf arrived from a mid-day mud wallow. ‘The herd would have been extra sensitive to any predators, because of the presence of the young calf, and were agitated as they approached from a long way off to investigate the lions scent that was blowing towards the herd. The pride of 12 lions fled after being charged by a group of elephants trying to protect their young calf . A pride of lions relax at Sausage Tree Camp in the Lower Zambezi National Park in Zambia, Africa . ‘The matriarch eventually spotted a camouflaged lioness close to our vehicle and the games began. ‘I repositioned the vehicle so we weren't part of the fleeing lion pride and watched as the whole elephant herd made sure who the real king of the jungle is! Lions are quicker than elephants thank goodness and none of them were hurt. ‘Eventually the elephant herd calmed down and moved off to feed. Elephants are a regular sight at Sausage Tree Camp on the banks of the Zambezi River . ‘The lions promptly sat down and went to sleep again, except for one of the 14-month-old cubs, who had climbed a small tree and was pretending to be a leaf. ‘Once he had made sure the elephants had gone he re-joined the pride to sleep.’ Ms Hipwood added: ‘Close encounters with big game are thrilling and exciting. ‘We got caught in the middle of a herd of elephants chasing 12 lions as the sun set on the Lower Zambezi - an unforgettable experience.’","Onlookers watched as the scene unfolded in Lower Zambezi National Park .

"A globe-trotting couple have put even the most dedicated selfie takers to shame, with a selection of stunning photographs in impressive dance poses around the world. Ashlee Montague, 24,  and her fiancé Richard Hanke, 28, who live in New York, first met in 2007 while dancing together at the Rock School for Dance Education in Philadelphia, and have spent most of the last two years training hand-to-hand and acrobatic ballet. Ashlee explained: 'We started dating the following summer and did long-distance for six months - Richard was dancing in Miami, and I in Seattle. Richard later moved to Seattle, and together we left for New York in 2009.' Ashlee Montague and Richard Hanke perform a pas de deux lift  in Paris. The duo met  at the Rock School for Dance Education, Philadelphia . She told MailOnline Travel: 'When we ask someone to take a picture of us we like to surprise them and don't tell them we're about to do something acrobatic. It's fun to see their reactions. 'Some people try to walk in closer to us for a typical two person photo and we have to ask them to step back because they won't get both of us in the shot. 'This is usually met with a confused ""okay"" and a few steps back. More often than not the surprise leads to a mediocre picture because they spend most of the time watching us instead of the screen, but to us that's a huge compliment.' The dancing duo have spent the last two years training hand-to-hand and acrobatic ballet. Pictured here in a pointe in hands backbend . The couple dream of  performing for a major circus company or production. Pictured here on the Pont de Bir Hakeim, in Paris . The pair are both trained in classical ballet and have performed at numerous locations around the world, including the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. 'It wasn't until we met some friends who are aerialists that we discovered the circus arts in 2011. 'In 2013 we decided we really wanted to pursue hand-to-hand as a career, and that's when we found our coach Jerome in Montreal. Now we are doing things now that we never would have dreamed about four years ago.' Ashlee Montague and her fiancé Richard Hanke show off their acrobatic prowess at the Trocadero Museum, in Paris . In spite of her passion for discovering new styles of dance, Miss Montague insists that twerking is not for her. 'Tried it once, it was embarrassing,' she says. 'For the immediate future we'd like to perform for a major circus company or production. 'We have big dreams for a two person show, but our ideas aren't fully together yet. A good production or touring contract now will give us the chance to gather our thoughts and ideas in our free time.' The elagent pair are perfectly silhouetted against a Parisien sky at the Trocadero Museum with Eiffel Tower in the background . 'Richard proposed on Christmas Eve, 2013 in New York City. He read somewhere that something women regret most on their engagement is not having their nails done in the pictures of their hands. 'He cleverly plotted for me to get my nails done with my friend while he set up roses, champagne, and little bags with letters for me to find. It was the most awesomely romantic thing ever.'

"Emails leaked in the Sony hack have revealed that Sony's Japanese CEO urged filmmakers to edit the death of Kim Jong-Un to make it less graphic in a bid to avoid a crisis. In The Interview, which is due to be released over Christmas, the North Korean dictator, played by Randall Park, is in a helicopter which is hit by a rocket. The footage of the dramatic scene, released as part of the cyberattack, shows the tyrant's face covered in burning embers and melting before the aircraft explodes. It is believed to be the final cut of his death, following a number of alterations discussed by Seth Rogan and the company's executives in both the United States and Asia. Scroll down for video . In The Interview, which is due to be released over Christmas, the North Korean dictator, played by Randall Park, dies when a helicopter he is in is hit by a rocket . In an email, obtained by The New York Times, the movie's creators Rogen and Evan Goldberg tell Amy Pascal, the employee at the center of many of the leaked messages, the edits they have made to the scene. It includes an angry correspondence from Rogen saying: 'This is now a story of Americans changing their movie to make North Koreans happy. That is a very damning story.' It reads: 'We took out three out of four face embers. Reduced the hair burning by 50 per cent, and significantly darkened the chunks of Kim's head. He finishes by saying: 'Let us know what you think ASAP.' Pascal then consults Sony's Japan-based CEO Kazuo Hirai about the shot described in Rogen's email. She said that the filmmakers arrived at the shot after much 'cajoling' and asked whether it was an acceptable end product. Pascal insisted that it included reduced 'face-melting' Hirai agrees with her, but in the first intervention from the company in 25 years, he asks her not to include the version in the international edition of the film. The footage of the dramatic scene, released as part of the cyberattack, shows the tyrant's face covered in burning embers and melting before the aircraft explodes . Following emails between Amy Pascal (left) and Sony's Japan-based CEO Kazuo Hirai (right), Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg were forced to change the ending to make it less graphic . He then urges her to push Rogen and Goldberg 'a bit further' to see if they can make the scene less graphic. Pascal responded by saying that Rogen was 'happy' with the agreement. However the director replied following the final cut, which saw them remove 'fire from the hair' and the 'secondary wave of head chunks', saying: 'This is it! Please tell me this is over now.' In the movie, two American journalists are recruited by the C.I.A. to kill the North Korean leader. Experts on North Korean society said that it would not be much of a surprise if the country was behind the hacking. On Monday, Rogen and James Franco, the stars of the comedy, broke their silence over the hacking. In one of the leaked emails, a frustrated Seth Rogen says: 'This is now a story of Americans changing their movie to make North Koreans happy. That is a very damning story' In an interview on ABC's Good Morning America: 'I don't know if the hacking honestly is because of our movie, definitively or not. I know that it has been the center of a lot of media attention lately,' Included in the leak were Rogen, 32, and 36-year-old Franco's salaries for the film, with a reported budget of $44 million. Records showed that Rogen, who also directed and wrote the script, was paid $8.4million for the film, while co-star Franco was paid $6.5 million. 'The movie itself is very silly and wasn't meant to be controversial in any way,' he added.","Scene shows tryant's face burning with embers following a rocket attack .

Zhou worked as a builder and needs to undergo surgery but doctors will not operate on him until the couple pay the 100,000 Yuan (£10,000) fee. His wife's sign read: 'Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to see my daughter and save my husband.' According to That's Magazines, she was also in possession of another poster that stated: 'Boss fled after industrial accident and we don't have the money for treatment. I'm willing to sell my child to save her father.' Many locals who witnessed her in distress were sympathetic to her plight. Although some gave her money, no-one offered to purchase her daughter in the four hours she sat in the street with the sign, the magazine reported.

Police in Shanghai charged the couple with human trafficking after accepting money for the baby, who was born at home and still only weeks, or months old, when sold. Despite claiming to have been acting in the baby's best interests, prosecutors said after having received the money, which was deposited in their bank account, the couple went out on a spending spree, using part of the proceeds to buy an iPhone.","Ni Qiong was pictured in Fuzhou offering to sell her baby daughter .

"A colossal statue of an ancient pharaoh has risen again after it was toppled in an earthquake 3,200 years ago. Archaeologists unveiled the restored monument of Amenhotep III - who ruled Egypt between 1386 and 1349 BC - in the famed temple city of Luxor. The statue shows the pharaoh in a striding pose and was re-erected at the northern gate of the king's funerary temple on the west bank of the Nile. A colossal statue (pictured) of an ancient pharaoh has risen again after it was toppled in an earthquake 3,200 years ago. The statue shows the pharaoh in a striding pose and was re-erected at the northern gate of the king's funerary temple on the west bank of the Nile . The temple is already famous for its existing 3,400-year-old Memnon colossi - twin statues of Amenhotep III whose reign archaeologists say marked the political and cultural zenith of ancient Egyptian civilisation. The 43ft (2.92-metre) statue, unveiled on Sunday, stands west of an existing effigy of the king, also depicting him walking, which was unveiled in March. 'These are, up to now, the highest standing effigies of an Egyptian king in striding attitude,' said German-Armenian archaeologist Hourig Sourouzian, who heads the project to conserve the temple. The world-famous twin Memnon colossi are 68ft (21 metres) tall but show the pharaoh seated. Impressive: An Egyptian policeman walks past a group of tourists and journalists standing in front of a newly displayed statue of pharaoh Amenhotep III in Egypt's temple city of Luxor. This statue was unveiled in March . Royalty: Egyptian archaeological workers stand next to a statue of pharaoh Amenhotep III. The king inherited an empire that stretched from the Euphrates to Sudan . The restored statue now stands again for the first time since its collapse 3,200 years ago, Dr Sourouzian told AFP from Luxor. Pharaoh Amenhotep III inherited an empire that stretched from the Euphrates to Sudan. The 18th dynasty ruler became king aged around 12, with his mother as regent. He is believed to have ruled Egypt between 1386 and 1349 BC. He chose the daughter of a provincial official as his royal wife, and throughout his reign Queen Tiy featured alongside the king. The king's palace at Malkata was close to his funerary temple - the largest ever built with its original location marked by the two 'Colossi of Memnon' statues. Amenhotep III died in around 1354 BC and was succeeded by his son Amenhotep IV, widely known as Akhenaten. Consisting of 89 large pieces and numerous small fragments and reassembled since November, the monolith weighs 110 tonnes. It had lain broken in pieces after the earthquake in 1200 BC, Dr Sourouzian said. The statue shows the king wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt, and each hand holding a papyrus roll inscribed with his name, like the one standing next to it that was unveiled earlier this year. His belt, holding a dagger with a falcon-head handle, is fastened with a rectangular clasp bearing the names of the king. Work to conserve the Amenhotep III temple is entirely funded through private and international donations.

"Families planning a ski trip in Europe this winter are being urged to research the cost of ski passes before they book. Research by leading travel money provider, ICE – International Currency Exchange, has found that prices can vary hugely across various European ski resorts. A six-day child pass in Italy will cost on average £46.50 (€58.50) but you'll need to stump up £160 (€200) in France. Bulgaria is the cheapest ski location in Europe, with a six-day ski pass at just £90,  less than half the cost of a pass in France and Switzerland . ICE has also found that a family of four (two adults, two children) could pay £385 (€486) for six-day ski passes in Germany compared to £715 (€900) in France, saving £333 (€414); a difference of 85 per cent. Overall, Germany comes out on top for value within the Eurozone, while Pamporovo in Bulgaria (outside the Eurozone) is the cheapest of all the resort costs studied, with a six-day ski pass at just £90 (€114), less than half the cost of a pass in France and Switzerland. Germany could be as much as 85 per cent cheaper for a family of four to ski than France . Skiers in the French Alps will be shelling out a fair amount on their ski passes compared to other locations . A family of four would pay £305 (€384) saving over £400 on the cost of passes in the Eurozone. 'Koko Sarkari, COO of ICE said: 'Ski pass costs are simply part and parcel of any skiing holiday but can make a big dent in the holiday budget. 'With the Pound now offering 1.2418 against the Euro compared to 1.1735 Euros this time last year, holidaymakers are already at an advantage this Christmas, almost £40 (€50) on a £700 order. 'But you can't predict how rates will change so it may pay to lock in the rate now for all the essentials on holiday from ski passes to Après Ski.'","Family of four could pay £715 in France, but £385 in Germany .

"A legal 'electronic joint’ to help patients with conditions that are eased by cannabis will go on sale in France next month. The firm behind the e-joint, called KanaVape, claims it will provide all the relaxing and pain-killing effects of marijuana, without the high.

It claims the e-joint, called KanaVape, will provide all the relaxing and painkilling effects of marijuana, without the high, as it does not contain the psychoactive ingredient THC . Cannabis-derived drugs such as Sativex are already used in the U.S., UK and other European countries to treat the pain associated with multiple sclerosis and cancer . ‘KanaVape brings you many of the benefits of cannabinoids without the psychotic effect of THC’, its makers claim, writing on their website. Cannabis-derived drugs such as Sativex are already used in the U.S., UK and other European countries to treat the pain associated with multiple sclerosis and cancer. Two other cannabis-derived drugs, Cesamet and Marinol, are also used in Canada and the U.S. to treat the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and AIDS-related anorexia. The founders of KanaVape, Antonin Cohen, a start up entrepreneur and Sebastian Beguerie, an agricultural engineer, spent two years extracting legal cannabinoids and developing the product, VICE News reports. It is made from the hemp version of the plant, grown legally in France, which contains more CBD and only 0.2 per cent THC, which is not enough for recreational users of cannabis. Mr Cohen, who previously worked in start-up companies in the U.S. where he said it was possible to earn a ‘comfortable salary’, said he quit his job and set up KanaVape as he wanted to help people suffering conditions that could be eased by marijuana. He realised many people in France suffer from cancer or MS, and said it was an ‘injustice’ they could not use cannabis to ease their pain. He said: ‘One of them said ""Cannabis plant helps me to fight against my illness, however, the legislation that I have to put myself in situations of illegality. I therefore cannot provide myself with cannabis legally, I cannot find quality cannabis.” ‘We sell this product in France for the sick, a harmless molecule is sued and cannot be accused of marketing a product for recreational use. There is no high in it.’ Antonin Cohen, who previously worked in start-up companies in America  said he set up KanaVape as he wanted to help people suffering conditions that could be eased by marijuana. Here, he is pictured speaking at the launch in Paris in December . He added that they are not interested in promoting the recreational use of cannabis, and have no problems with current drugs laws. He is working with a legal firm who advise on the best ways to market the products. Mr Cohen is launching his product amid a blazing debate over whether e-cigarettes should be regulated. Some experts argue they are safer than smoking traditional tobacco, whose bouquet of toxic chemicals and gases can cause cancer, heart disease and strokes. But the World Health Organization has called for them to be banned in public places, and their sale to vulnerable groups like minors and pregnant women regulated, as not enough research has been carried out into their long-term use. Mr Cohen insists that he controls the entire production chain to ensure his product is safe. While they are not officially registered as organic – because they did not pay the certifications – he claims their farming methods are the equivalent, he said.","Legal 'electronic joint' developed to help ailments eased by cannabis .

At the moment, Google's search results and Shopping tab find items for sale and then send the customer to that merchant's website to complete the purchase. Under the rumoured plans, if a customer wants to buy an item without looking at it on the merchant's site first, they can pay for it in one click of the Buy button. The exact details of the scheme have not been announced, and reports claim the plans are still in the very early stages. On Amazon, when a customer places their first order and enters a payment method and delivery address, 1-Click ordering is automatically enabled.

"It is the season for travel chaos and passengers travelling from Gatwick and Heathrow appear to have the worst experience, according to statistics. Nearly half of all departures from the two London airports were delayed or cancelled last Christmas and New Year. Overall, two in five UK departures (38 per cent) were affected, with Heathrow sitting well above the average at 47 per cent. New research finds that 38% of all UK departures disrupted near the holidays - with Heathrow averaging 47% . Of the 9,521 flights departing from Heathrow over last year's festive season, 4,409 were delayed and 63 were cancelled due to high winds and rain. This new research comes from flightright.co.uk, a consumer portal for air passenger compensation on delayed, cancelled or overbooked flights. And the UK's next largest airport did not fare much better. Over 45 per cent of departures were affected at Gatwick Airport, while Bristol, Newcastle and Manchester rounded up the top five. The UK's second largest airport, Gatwick, does not fare much better - 45% of all flights were affected last year . The silver lining? London Stansted does fairly well with on-time departures with only 27% delayed . For those flying out of the capital, there is some good news, however: London Stansted fared better than average, with just 27 per cent of departures delayed or cancelled. Flight departures from December 20, 2013, through January 5, 2014, were analysed by the company and the top 10 worst UK airports were identified. 1. London Heathrow - 47% . 2. London Gatwick - 45% . 3. Bristol - 37% . 4. Newcastle - 36% . 5. Manchester - 36% . 6. Glasgow GLA - 35% . 7. Southampton - 33% . 8. Cardiff - 32% . 9. Edinburgh - 31% . 10. Liverpool - 31% . And for anyone who was caught up last Christmas, there may be a silver lining. Marek Janetzke, Managing Director of flightright, said: 'The Christmas and New Year holiday remains a peak time for air travel in the UK, and with the unpredictable winter weather, delays and cancellations are common. Looking for a distraction during your delay? Thankfully there are plenty of shops in London Heathrow . 'Unfortunately, most passengers still do not know about their rights as airlines frequently leave them without information or don’t tell them that they are entitled to compensation or support. Airlines may be obliged to provide snacks, refreshments, telephone calls (or other means of communication), or hotel accommodation – even if they are not responsible for the issue. 'It only takes a three hour delay to be eligible for compensation of around £200. 'Potential compensation can reach up to £475 per passenger depending on the flight distance and delay time. 'UK passengers have up to six years to make a claim compensation so it’s not too late to claim for flight delays over last Christmas.'","Holiday travel may be stressful again for travellers through Heathrow .

"The Swedish Lapland's iconic Icehotel is now open for business. Over the last several weeks, 42 artists from around the world have gathered in the village of Jukkasjarvi to create the stunning hotel and art exhibition to celebrate its 25th anniversary. Using 1,600 tonnes of ice and snow from the nearby frozen Torne River, the 'pop up' hotel was one of the first of its kind when it was originally built in 1990. Scroll down for video . This cosy hotel suite is comprised of 12 frames, which form a gradient and offer the illusion of infinity . The 'Borderland' room is inspired by the folk art that decorated the typical wooden houses of the region of eastern Poland . This year's ice bar is called 'Boom,' as it appears to have risen out of an enormous ice explosion . Each year it opens in December before melting away the following March. For this season, there are 16 individually designed 'art suites' based on concepts such as the perception of time, the change of seasons and the idea of love. Designs range from frozen forest fairies to the inner workings of a clock to a human-sized chess board. There are also two deluxe suites, which each have an en-suite bathroom and sauna. To celebrate the Icehotel's 25th year, Kristian Anttila played a concert in the main Aurora Hall, which is made entirely of ice . The design is inspired by a giant pressure wave that has forced sharp blocks of ice through the bar, sending snow and ice splashing upwards . Suite 305 is better known as the 'Hot Type' suite where letterpress typography, which are hand-carved, protrude from the wall . The room was designed by graphic designers and typography enthusiasts, who used the fonts baskerville, bodoni and futura in the suite . The reception and main hall have been designed to honour those who helped in the Icehotel's construction, including a gallery of illuminated photography and sculptures of local wildlife. This year's ice bar appears as though it was risen from a giant explosion - with shards of ice decorating the walls and a large dance floor. For its anniversary, Icehotel is also unveiling the Aurora Hall, a 1,800-square-foot dome-shaped theatre, which can be rented out for private functions and live performances for up to 150 people. The Aurora Hall is made of solid ice, which creates a unique acoustic environment and also offers a transparent ceiling. Sweden's Icehotel is officially open for its 25th year. The hotel uses 1,600 tonnes of ice and snow from the nearby Torne River . In suite 303, 'Spring' has come early - and it is inspired by the colours and scents that arise when winter ends and nature comes back to life . Suite 320 is called 'Two As One' and is a visual representation of the moment of perfection that ensues when love strikes . 'Abject Beauty' is the theme of suite 316 where five extremely detailed and anatomical sculptures grow out of the wall . This will also be the first year that the hotel will offer a well-being escape, designed for those looking for a healthy break in a very cool setting. Guests will have the opportunity to try out winter running using specially designed grippers on one of the scenic trails. Adventurous visitors can also try cross-country skiing, take part in a snowmobiling excursion or try their hand at dog-sledding.","Over the last few weeks, 42 artists from around the world have constructed the Icehotel for the 25th time .

"Last week, more than 117,500 people in the Bay Area were left without power after a massive storm made landfall in Northern California. While states such as California have to deal with power outages relatively frequently, a new US study suggests other metropolitan areas could soon be heading for the same fate. Researchers in Maryland created a computer model that predicts New York City, followed by Philadelphia, Jacksonville and Virginia are at severe risk of being left in the dark. Researchers in Maryland have created a computer model that predicts New York City, followed by Philadelphia, Jacksonville and Virginia as being at severe risk of being left in the dark . The model combined, data on the risk of severe weather patterns as a result of climate change, along with information on the vulnerability of power grids. There is good news for people living in Memphis, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Buffalo, whose future risk of outages is unlikely to dramatically change. Seth Guikema, a professor in the university's Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering, said his team's analysis could help metropolitan areas better plan for climate change. Pictured is the 100-year fraction of customers without power for metropolitan areas of New York and Washington. The colours show the scenarios of varying storm intensity . This graph shows the scenarios for landfall loss. To create the landfall scenarios, the first divided the entire coastline into segments labelled 1 to 98, starting at the Texas-Mexico border and ending at the Maine-Canada border. Landfall 2 spreads the distribution out more, Landfall 3 focuses more on the Gulf of Mexico, Landfall 4 shifts the distribution towards the mid-Atlantic, Landfall 5 concentrates more on the Florida peninsula . 1 - New York . 2- Philadelphia . 3 - Jacksonville . 4 - Virginia Beach . 5 - Hartford . 6 - Orlando . 7 - Tampa . 8 - Providence . 9 - Miami . 10 - New Orleans . 'We provide insight into how power systems along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts may be affected by climate changes,' said Professor Guikema. 'If I'm mayor of Miami, we know about hurricanes, we know about outages and our system has been adapted for it. But if I'm mayor of Philadelphia, I might say, ""Whoa, we need to be doing more about this.""' Not surprisingly, lead author of the paper, Andrea Staid, found results depend strongly on location. If climate change intensifies hurricane activity, some areas of the US would feel the impact more than others. Cities already in the eye of the storm, such as Miami and New Orleans, would remain so. But cities such as New York City and Philadelphia, as well as some more inland urban areas, would likely be increasingly susceptible to more frequent and intense storm activity, the team found. Mapped landfall scenarios, with red showing the highest probabilities of a virtual storm making landfall in the east stretch of coastline. Probabilities are annual probabilities of landfall in each segment . A map from Pacific Gas & Electric reveals the widespread outages on Thursday thanks to a powerful storm that forced nearly 100,000 Northern Californians to get ready for work in the dark . For both New York City and Philadelphia, the 100-year storm scenario - which is the level of storm impacts expected to be exceeded on average once every hundred years - would be 50 per cent higher. 1 - Memphis . 2 - Dallas . 3 - Pittsburgh . 4 - Atlanta . 5 - Buffalo . In that same type of 100-year storm situation, the researchers predict about a 30 per cent increase in the number of customers without power in Miami and New Orleans relative to current climate conditions. In more geographically protected cities, such as Baltimore and Washington, there would be about a 20 per cent increase in the number of customers without power in the 100-year storm. 'The range of results demonstrates the sensitivity of the U.S. power system to changes in storm behaviour,' Professor Guikema said. 'Infrastructure providers and emergency managers need to plan for hurricanes in a long-term manner, and that planning has to take climate change into account.'

"In the past few months, conclusive evidence has been found that Mars once had water on its surface, but one greater question remains: Was there, or is there still, life on Mars as well? Scientists may be on the brink of answering that question with an equally conclusive 'yes', as convincing evidence has been detected by Nasa's Curiosity rover. An instrument on the rover identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria-like organisms on the surface - and it could be the first alien life ever detected. Scroll down for video . Nasa scientists in California have revealed evidence that suggests there is life on Mars based on readings taken by the Curiosity rover (shown). They say methane spikes on the planet could be produced by bacteria. And at the moment there is no alternative explanation for the spikes . This image illustrates possible ways methane might be added to Mars' atmosphere (sources) and removed from the atmosphere (sinks). NASA's Curiosity Mars rover has detected fluctuations in methane concentration in the atmosphere, implying both types of activity occur on modern Mars. 'This temporary increase in methane -- sharply up and then back down -- tells us there must be some relatively localized source,' said Sushil Atreya of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Curiosity rover science team. 'There are many possible sources, biological or non-biological, such as interaction of water and rock.' Previous satellite observations have detected unusual plumes of methane on the planet. But none of these previous readings are as extraordinary as the sudden 'venting' measured at Gale Crater, where evidence suggests water once flowed billions of years ago. Curiosity landed in the 96 mile-wide (154km) crater in August 2012 and has been exploring the region ever since. Recently, Nasa reported that Gale contained the remains of an ancient freshwater lake where there may have been a hospitable environment for life in the distant past. Life is the chief producer of methane on Earth, but there are many non-biological processes that can also generate the gas. The low background level of methane detected by Curiosity can be explained by the sun's rays degrading organic material possibly deposited by meteors, said the Nasa scientists. But the spikes of methane required an additional source, which was unlikely to be a recent impact by comet or asteroid. Such an object would have had to measure several metres across and would have left a large crater - no sign of which was visible. The short time-scale of the methane spikes did not suggest that the gas was released from volcanic deposits trapped in ice, called clathrates either. Nor did it appear to come from the release of gaseous methane that had become bound to the soil. The new discovery, reported in the journal Science, followed studies of gas samples by Curiosity's Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) - an instrument that uses intense light to carry out chemical analysis. It revealed a low background level of methane, which spiked 10-fold over a period of just 60 Martian days. In four sequential measurements, Curiosity showed the methane level soaring from about 0.69 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) to 7.2 ppbv. The spikes occurred within 655ft to 985ft (200 to 300 metres) of each other and less than 0.62 miles (1km) from where the lower readings were detected. By the time Curiosity had travelled a further kilometre, the higher methane levels had disappeared. In their paper, the US scientists led by Dr Chris Webster, from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, wrote: 'The persistence of the high methane values over 60 sols (Martian days) and their sudden drop 47 sols later is not consistent with a well-mixed event, but rather with a local production or venting that, once terminated, disperses quickly.' The wind direction indicated a source to the north of the rover. The methane spikes were spotted by Curiosity's Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS), which is part of the large Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) suite of instruments, seen here on Earth before launch. The spikes were spotted briefly before disappearing - suggesting that bacteria is living on or under the surface . Life is the chief producer of methane on Earth, but there are many non-biological processes that can also generate the gas. The low background level of methane detected by Curiosity can be explained by the sun's rays degrading organic material possibly deposited by meteors, said the Nasa scientists. Billions of years ago, a lake once filled the 96-mile- (154-km) wide crater being explored by Nasa's Mars rover Curiosity, bolstering evidence that the planet most like Earth in the solar system was suitable for microbial life. That's according to the latest findings, which combined more than two years of data collected by Curiosity since its sky-crane landing inside Gale Crater in August 2012. Scientists discovered stacks of rocks containing water-deposited sediments inclined toward the crater's center, which now sports a three-mile (5 km) mound called Mount Sharp. But the spikes of methane required an additional source, which was unlikely to be a recent impact by comet or asteroid. Such an object would have had to measure several metres across and would have left a large crater - no sign of which was visible. The short time-scale of the methane spikes did not suggest that the gas was released from volcanic deposits trapped in ice, called clathrates either. Nor did it appear to come from the release of gaseous methane that had become bound to the soil. The Nasa authors are cautious about jumping to conclusions, but conclude that 'methanogenesis' - the formation of methane by microbial bugs known as methanogens - may be one answer to the riddle. They wrote: 'Our measurements spanning a full Mars year indicate that trace quantities of methane are being generated on Mars by more than one mechanism or a combination of proposed mechanisms - including methanogenesis either today or released from past reservoirs, or both.' Life is the chief producer of methane on Earth, but there are non-biological processes that can also generate the gas. However, the spikes of methane spotted on Mars required an additional source, which was unlikely to be a recent impact by comet or asteroid striking Mars (shown) - but could be explained by bacteria . NASA's Mars rover Curiosity drilled into this rock target, ""Cumberland,"" during the 279th Martian day, or sol, of the rover's work on Mars (May 19, 2013) and collected a powdered sample of material from the rock's interior. Gale Crater, on the Martian equator, was created when a large meteor struck the planet 3.5 billion to 3.8 billion years ago. At its centre is a high mountain, named Mount Sharp, that rises 18,000ft (5,500 metres) above the crater floor. Flowing water appears to have carved channels in the sides of the mountain and the crater walls. Another major discovery by Curiosity was that of water bound in the fine-grained soil within the crater. Each cubic foot of Martian soil was found to contain around two pints of water, not freely accessible but attached to minerals. Curiosity also detected different Martian organic chemicals in powder drilled from a rock dubbed Cumberland, the first definitive detection of organics in surface materials of Mars. These Martian organics could either have formed on Mars or been delivered to Mars by meteorites. 'This first confirmation of organic carbon in a rock on Mars holds much promise,' said Curiosity participating scientist Roger Summons of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. 'Organics are important because they can tell us about the chemical pathways by which they were formed and preserved. 'In turn, this is informative about Earth-Mars differences and whether or not particular environments represented by Gale Crater sedimentary rocks were more or less favorable for accumulation of organic materials. 'The challenge now is to find other rocks on Mount Sharp that might have different and more extensive inventories of organic compounds.' Researchers also reported that Curiosity's taste of Martian water, bound into lakebed minerals in the Cumberland rock more than three billion years ago, indicates the planet lost much of its water before that lakebed formed and continued to lose large amounts after. Earlier findings by Curiosity revealed layers of sedimentary rock in Gale Crater (shown) that must have been produced by water in the planet's past billions of years ago, bolstering evidence that the planet most like Earth in the solar system was once suitable for microbial life - or still is . Observations by the rover Curiosity have indicated that Mars' Mount Sharp, where it is currently exploring, was built by sediments deposited in a large lake bed over tens of millions of years, shown in this illustration. Gale Crater is 96 miles (154 kilometers) in diameter, and at its centre today is Mount Sharp . The rover has reached the base of Mount Sharp and over the coming months will begin a slow climb. Scientists are especially keen to explore the mountain because its sedimentary layers provide tantalising snapshots of Martian history. The question of whether there is, or was, life on Mars may finally be answered by Esa's ExoMars mission, which will land a 300kg (660lbs) rover on the Red Planet in 2019. ExoMars will be equipped with a 6.5-foot (two metres) drill and the ability to detect biomarkers of life. It will not be heading for Gale Crater, however. Because it will land with less precision than Curiosity, the crater and its mountain are considered too potentially hazardous.","Nasa scientists in California have revealed evidence for life on Mars .

"The haul of bags you inevitably end up with when Christmas shopping can leave you fumbling for your credit card while half your purchases end up on the floor. Now Barclaycard claims it has the answer to such shopping woes. The bank is trialling prototype 'tap and pay' gloves that let shoppers pay for items with a swipe of their hand in the same way they would with their contactless cards. Forget chip and pin: Barclaycard's gloves are embedded with a small contactless chip that can be linked to a credit or debit card. As with contactless cards, they can be used to pay for transactions of up to £20 ($31), without the need to enter a PIN at the till . Prototypes of the gloves are currently being trialled in the UK, with a view to possibly making them available to consumers more widely next year. This is the latest move towards wearable technology, which people can use to help them deal with their everyday finances. In November, Nationwide Building Society announced that its customers can now check their balances using a watch on their wrist. Nationwide said members who have downloaded the mobile banking app for Android will be able to access their balance using their Android Wear smartwatch. Big spender: Prototypes of the gloves are currently being trialled by Barclaycard in the UK (pictured) with a view to possibly making them available to consumers more widely next year . Hands on: The gloves (pictured) are the latest move towards wearable technology which people can use to help them deal with their everyday finances . They can also set the smartwatch to give them daily notifications of how much money is in their account. The Barclaycard gloves are embedded with a small contactless chip that can be linked to a credit or debit card. As with contactless cards, they can be used to pay for transactions of up to £20 ($31), without the need to enter a PIN at the till. In September, Barclaycard announced that it was trialing the bPay band in London to make payments. The band contains a smart chip and a tiny radio antenna that triggers a payment when it is swiped over a terminal on a bus or the security barrier at an underground or train station. The same technology can pay for a cup of coffee or a sandwich when the wristband is waved across a high street till terminal. Initially, the bands were made available to 10,000 commuters in London, however there is a plan for a national launch next year, presenting them as an alternative to cash for small purchases. Users effectively load money on to the band from their own debit or credit card via the bPay website and then make purchases up to a value of £20 ($32) on a single item. They can top it up themselves online or arrange for cash to be automatically loaded if it falls below a set trigger point of, for example, £5 ($8). Contactless technology has become increasingly popular in recent years, with 45 million contactless cards now in circulation and more than 300,000 places where contactless payments can be made across the UK. Barclaycard said that the contactless readers that currently exist would not have to be specially adapted in order to be compatible with the gloves. It is also considering making the gloves available to non-Barclaycard customers, but its plans will depend on the feedback it receives from initial trials. Mike Saunders, managing director of digital consumer payments at Barclaycard, said that if the prototypes prove popular, the gloves 'could be bringing some festive cheer to bag-laden shoppers by Christmas 2015'. Mr Saunders said wearable technology is seeing huge growth, with consumers generally wanting items that are easy to wear, fashionable and that have added functions. The technology used within the gloves is adaptable to other items of clothing or accessories and Barclaycard had considered the possibility of creating tap and pay bracelets, handbags, hats or even elbow pads. But the consumer research it carried out suggested that a warm pair of woolly gloves would prove particularly popular as a payment method. The gloves are also touchscreen-enabled so shoppers can also wear them when using their phones. Barclaycard added it is working on 'his and hers' versions of the gloves, with the women's version having a softer and more 'fleecy' appearance than the men's.

"Life has been discovered nearly a mile and half underground, raising hopes bacteria might be able to survive deep beneath the surface of other planets. Researchers found the single-celled organisms living inside coal beds more than 8,000ft (2,440 metres) below the seabed off the coast of Japan. It is the deepest life has yet been found beneath the ocean. At those depths the spherical microbes have to survive huge pressures that would crush most organisms while having no access to light or oxygen often needed for life. Scroll down for video . Researchers found the single-celled organisms living inside coal beds more than 8,000ft (2.4 metres) below the seabed, off the coast of Japan. It is the deepest life has yet been found beneath the ocean. The tiny single celled microbes were found to get nutrients by breaking down coal and other hydrocarbons . Instead, the bacteria scavenge the chemicals they need to survive by breaking down the hydrocarbon compounds in the coal around them. Scientists from the International Ocean Discovery Program, who made the discovery, said the microbes also have sluggish metabolisms. Evidence from spacecraft and rovers have not proved that the surface of Mars once flowed with water. The most recent  findings from Nasa's Mars rover Curiosity has shown that, billions of years ago, a lake once filled a 96 mile wide crater it is now exploring. Water is considered to be one of the most crucial ingredients needed for life and has raised the question that if life could evolve here on Earth, why would it not have done so on Mars. Scientists have yet to find conclusive proof that organisms lived on the surface of Mars. However, the new findings suggest that if it cannot be found on the surface, then scientists may want to look below ground. Indeed bacteria that can survive here without the need for oxygen would be protected from harmful radiation from space.Future missions like the European Space Agency's ExoMars will drill down into the Martian surface, but their drill will only extend a few feet. If scientists want to seek life that might exist like that which exists in the coal beds beneath our oceans, they are going to need a bigger drill. The findings, which are to be revealed at the America Geophysical Union Fall Meeting, raise the prospect that life may still be clinging on deep underground on planets such as Mars, where there was once thought to be flowing water on the surface. Dr Elizabeth Trembath-Reichert, from the California Institute of Technology, who is part of the team that carried out the research, told the Mail Online: 'The deeper we keep looking, the deeper we keep finding life. 'It looks like for the most part they survive on the celery of the microbial world, but when pre-made molecules of another dead cell are available they can take those in and use it as their own rather than having to make everything from scratch themselves, thereby saving energy.' The microbes were found in core samples taken by the IODP Expedition 337, which took place in 2012 just off the coast of Japan's Shimokital Peninsula in the northwestern Pacific. A huge drill was lowered more than 3,000 feet (915 metres) through the waves from the research ship Chikyu before then drilling down a further 8,034 feet (2,446 metres) of rock beneath the seafloor. The microbes were found to be thriving in the cores taken from the coal beds beneath the seafloor, creating what they have called 'coal bed biospheres'. In an attempt to understand how these bacteria survive, the researchers conducted experiments to feed the microbes a range of different hydrocarbon compounds. They found that as well as coal, they were also able to eat other small chained fossil fuels found within deep sea oil and gas, breaking them down into methane gas. However, snacking on these hydrocarbons leaves the microbes with an extremely slow metabolism as they try to use as little energy as possible. The research vessel Chikyu drilled nearly a mile and a half (2.4km) below the seabed off Japan's Shimokital Peninsula (pictured). In an attempt to understand how these bacteria survive, the researchers conducted experiments to feed the microbes a range of different hydrocarbon compounds . The researchers found the bacteria thriving in coal samples returned to the surface by the deep sea drilling. They found that as well as coal, the organisms were able to eat other small chained fossil fuels found within deep sea oil and gas, breaking them down into methane gas . Scientists now believe there could be many other microbes living within the coal beds, helping each other to survive in an ecosystem. Dr Trembath-Reichert said they are also keen to find out how the microbes got there in the first place. Such findings could have implications for where life may be found on other planets. She said: 'We don't know exactly how they get down there. It is possible they start in a surface environment and the ones we find are just the ones that can survive. 'As we expand our understanding of the habitable zones of life on Earth, we can use these temperatures and pressures to help model where similar conditions may exist on other terrestrial bodies. We may not be limited to the surfaces of other planets.' The ship used an enormous deep sea drill to retrieve intact cores of the rock and coal from below the seafloor. Scientists now believe there could be many other microbes living within the coal beds, helping each other to survive in an ecosystem . The expedition spent nearly 70 days at sea while drilling down into the Earth's crust to search for life .","Tiny single celled organisms survive by feeding on coal, gas and oil .

"The meaning behind a 'moo' may have been solved by scientists, who have recorded and analysed the way cows communicate. British researchers found cows make two very distinct calls when they talk to their calves, depending on the distance between them. They also identified a specific call a calf makes to its mother when its wants to start suckling. Cows and their calves communicate using calls that are individualised in a similar way to human names. The team studied two herds of free-range cattle on a farm in Nottinghamshire. Recordings were made using highly sensitive audio equipment . The team spent 10 months studying the ways cows talked to their young to discover cows make maternal low sounds when a mother is close to her calf. The louder, higher pitched calls are reserved for when a calf is out of visual contact. Meanwhile, calves make a specific call when they want milk. But, the most important finding was that all three calls were individualised  in a similar way to human names. Lead scientist Dr Monica Padilla de la Torre, from the University of Nottingham, said: 'The research shows for the first time that mother-offspring cattle 'calls' are individualised - each calf and cow have a characteristic and exclusive call of their own. The team spent 10 months studying the ways cows (stock image) talked to their young to discover the animals make maternal low sounds when a mother is close to her calf. The louder, higher pitched calls are reserved for when a calf is out of visual contact. Meanwhile, calves make a specific call when they want milk . 'Acoustic analysis also reveals that certain information is conveyed within the calf calls - age, but not gender.' The team studied two herds of free-range cattle on a farm in Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire. Recordings were made using highly sensitive equipment that gathered enough data to study for a year. Low frequency calls - These are produced by cows when they are close to their calves, usually a few weeks after birth. Louder high frequency calls - The louder calls are made when cows are separated from their calves, after nursing, and not in visual contact. Calf calls - These calls are created when calves are separated from their mothers and want to suckle milk. Further work may reveal vocal indicators of well-being or distress in cows which could influence animal care policies, say the researchers . Co-author Dr Alan McElligott, from Queen Mary University of London, said: 'This is the first time that complex cattle calls have been analysed using the latest and best techniques. 'Our results provide an excellent foundation for investigating vocal indicators of cattle welfare.' Farmer James Bourne, who has been around cows since the 1950s, told the BBC that the research supports what he has always noticed himself. 'A calf certainly knows its mother from other cows, and when a calf [calls] the mother knows it's her calf,' said Mr Bourne, who is a farmer in Lincolnshire. 'If they are not distressed, and they are calm, they will moo fairly low to the calf, almost talking to their calf.' Co-author Dr Alan McElligott said: 'This is the first time complex cattle calls have been analysed using the latest and best techniques. Our results provide an excellent foundation for investigating vocal indicators of cattle welfare.'

"A stray cat has become a local celebrity after it sneaked into a shop at an airport in far eastern Russia and helped itself to expensive fish and squid. Despite being caught red-handed by staff at Vladivostok International Airport, the tabby cat continued its feast and didn’t seem to care that she was being recorded on a cellphone camera. The furry intruder was eventually removed from the closed shop’s showcase fridge and given a proper home thanks to her newfound fame. The tabby cat rips into vacuum-sealed packages in a refrigerator at a fish shop at Vladivostok's airport . While it was an amusing sight, as much as £700 worth of seafood (approximately $1,100) was eaten or thrown in the bin as a result of the hungry cat’s feast at a shop called Fish Island. The ravenous feline ate through vacuum-sealed packages of smoked fish and squid, according to staff. A shop assistant told Russia’s Ria Novosti agency: ‘The cat made its way inside the counter, and ate and nibbled the goods, scratched and wrecked the packaging around the squid and dried fish.’ As much as £700 worth of seafood (approximately $1,100) was eaten by the cat or thrown in the bin . The airport said CCTV showed the cat sneaking into the shop while it was open, but staff didn't know she was there and locked her inside when they went home for the day. It turned out to be a costly loss for the shop, which had to throw all of the fridge’s contents in the bin and sanitise the appliance before restocking it with more seafood. The cat has become a local celebrity as many residents of Vladivostok offered to adopt her. The cat was given to an ice hockey club and named Matroskin after an adventurous cartoon character . She has been gifted to Admiral Vladivostok, a professional ice hockey club in the Kontinental Hockey League. The cat has become the team's official mascot. They named her Matroskin after an adventurous feline character from the famous Soviet cartoon Three from Prostokvashino.","Stray cat has become a celebrity in Vladivostok in far eastern Russia .

"Busy British workers are losing more of their annual leave this year than ever before. This year, the typical employee will fail to use a little over three days of holiday (3.34 days), as opposed to an average of 1.55 wasted days in previous years. And a third of respondents are blaming the busy nature of their jobs, claiming they simply cannot take any more time off work. A new study found that 18-24 year old Brits were least likely to use up all of their annual holiday days . Meanwhile, one in six (16 per cent) workers are so worried about losing their jobs they fear being away from the office on annual leave. The trend, revealed in a study by thetrainline.com, shows the lengths that workers go to earn respect from bosses and the stress at keeping their jobs. More than a third (36 per cent) of workers will fail to book their remaining time off by the end of 2014. And while some might be stressed about being absent from the office, one in six (17 per cent) simply lose track of their remaining number of days. Travelling for Christmas? Not likely! 36% of survey takers will not claim their days by the end of 2014 . But being stuck in the office will cause 1 in 3 to become angry - yet, admittedly, helps to further their career . Yet the poll of 2,000 workers found those most likely to not use all of their annual leave were those aged 18 to 24 years old. Indeed, a third of younger staff are worried about keeping their job - making them the most concerned group when it comes to job security. Being stuck in the office may also cause one in three to become angry, yet the same number are pleased they put in the hard graft as it helps further their career. Iain Hildreth, Marketing Director at thetrainline.com, said: 'Being too busy at work may leave some people stuck in the office instead of being off on holiday, but this might cause you to be more stressed as a result. 'It's good to take a break every now and then, and especially as the year draws in a last minute day off might come as a welcome treat. 'If you take your leftover holiday you can use the time to visit friends, family or have a long weekend away.'","New study finds that the typical employee will fail to use 3.34 holiday days .

"Kathie Lee Gifford has claimed that Bill Cosby tried to kiss her during their comedy tour in the 70s. The Today host, who has been a staunch defender of the comedian in the wake of mounting sexual assault allegations, opened up about her experience on the show on Tuesday morning. Gifford said the incident took place when she was touring with Cosby, who was married to wife Camille at the time. 'I will admit, towards the very last times I saw him, he did try to kiss me,' she said. 'I said, ""Bill, no, we're friends,"" and he said, ""OK, goodnight,"" and I said, ""Goodnight."" And I went to my room, and he went into his room.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Kathie Lee Gifford revealed on the Today show on Tuesday morning that Bill Cosby tried to kiss her in the 1970s - but when she rebuffed his advances, 'he respected it' Uncertainty: She said that she was not saying Cosby's accusers were lying, just that she had never seen any similar conduct. She said that he had treated her with 'great kindness and generosity' Gifford said that she felt a 'chill' when she heard that supermodel Beverly Johnson accused Cosby of giving her a cappuccino spiked with a drug. 'I do know that I got a chill because every night when we'd come off stage and Bill would be going on-stage, he would have made cappuccinos for all three of us,' she said, referring to her backup dancers. 'And I always thought it was such a kindness and it was so sweet, and now you see Beverly Johnson saying that he made her a cappuccino, and I just don't want it to be true, but I'm not saying that the women are liars... I'm just saying I never personally saw it with my own two eyes.' She went on: 'A lot of married men come onto single women... but once I said, ""No, absolutely not,"" he respected it.' Friends: Gifford, with Cosby and co-host Hoda Kotb, toured with the comedian for two years in the 70s . Support: Her claims come a day after Cosby's wife Camille, pictured together in November, slammed the media coverage of the accusations - suggesting he was the real victim . Throughout the segment, she insisted that Cosby had acted with 'great kindness and generosity' over the two years they worked together. More than two dozen women, including model Janice Dickinson, have claimed that Cosby, now 77, drugged and sexually assaulted them in incidents stretching from the 1960s until the 2000s. He has denied any wrongdoing and no criminal charges have ever been brought - but in 2006, he did settle a civil lawsuit with a woman who claimed he drugged and raped her in 2004. Her comments come a day after Camille Cosby broke her silence. She compared the media's handling of the reports to Rolling Stone's botched coverage of the UVA rape scandal. 'There appears to be no vetting of my husband's accusers before stories are published or aired,' she said. 'An accusation is published, and immediately goes viral... None of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking a victim. But the question should be asked - who is the victim?' See below for video .

"The Duchess of Cambridge exchanged high end fashion for a hoodie as she helped out a Beaver Scout colony tonight. Kate, who is five months pregnant, wore a black UK Scouting hooded top with black skinny J Brand jeans and boots as she helped eager youngsters to ice a cake blindfold. Kate worked as a volunteer for the Scout Association when she and Prince William lived in Anglesey, North Wales, and looked delighted to be helping children at the 23rd Poplar Beaver Scout Colony earn a new badge. Scroll down for video . Scouting for royals: The Duchess of Cambridge exchanged high end fashion for a hoodie as she helped out a Beaver Scout colony tonight, teaching the eager youngsters at the 23rd Poplar Beaver Scout Colony to ice a cake blindfold . Woman in black: Kate, who is five months pregnant, wore a black UK Scouting hooded top with black skinny J Brand jeans and boots as she helped the children earn their disability awareness badge . It promised to be a messy evening as the Duchess helped the Beavers, aged between five and eight, learn about life with disabilities. As well as teaching the children to ice a cake, Kate  cut up a chocolate bar with boxing gloves, learned the Scout Promise in sign language, and helped children put a wet suit on blindfolded, supported by two-times world para triathlon champion Steve Judge. In return, the children  earned a disability awareness badge. The Duchess went to the meeting at Old Ford Primary School in Bow in the East End to highlight the Scout Association’s new campaign, Better Prepared, designed to bring Scouting to 200 of the most deprived parts of the country. Good cause: The Duchess of Cambridge learns sign language as she meets one young girl at the newly established  Scout colony. Her visit was in support of the Scout Association's 'Better Prepared' campaign – a project designed to reach 200 of the most deprived areas in the country . Shown the ropes: Kate was shown around by Carlos Lopez-Plandolit (centre), the Beaver Scout colony leader, who became a volunteer about a year ago after coming to Britain five years ago from Spain to work for a technology company . Jam packed evening: As well as teaching the children to ice a cake and learn the Scout promise in sign language, Kate was due to help the children to cut up a chocolate bar with boxing gloves and put a wet suit on blindfolded . Royal seal of approval: The Duchess gives a thumbs up sign to one young Scout after she masters the promise in sign language . But the movement, which has 446,000 youth members and already works in 70 of the 100 most deprived parts of the UK, will need to recruit 1,000 more adult volunteers to make it happen in those 200 areas. Across the country, Scouting needs 16,000 more adult volunteers to ensure that it can give the 40,000 young people on its waiting lists a place. The Beaver Scout colony in Poplar and Bow was launched last year. Wayne Bulpitt, UK Chief Commissioner of The Scout Association, said: 'We’re delighted that the Duchess has been able to help us celebrate the launch of Better Prepared – a project designed to reach 200 of the most deprived areas in the country, so all young people can access life-changing, everyday adventure. Task master: Kate looks concerned as she is handed a red boxing glove for her next assignment at the meeting . Getting to grips: Kate attempts simple tasks, such as chopping up a chocolate bar while wearing a pair of boxing gloves . Getting the giggles: Kate got stuck in to the activities, laughing as she joined a group of Beavers trying to cut up and eat Mars Bars using boxing gloves to simulate those with mobility or coordination problems . Reaching out: The Duchess tries to grab a plastic fork while wearing her boxing glove, to the amusement of Scout leader Mr Lopez-Plandolit . Familiar: Kate worked as a volunteer for the Scout Association when she and Prince William lived in Anglesey, North Wales, and looked delighted to be helping children at the 23rd Poplar Beaver Scout Colony win a new badge . One of the gang: The Duchess was quickly given a UK Scouts scarf of the 23rd Poplar group tied in a friendship knot and got down to activities with the children . 'The Duchess has seen at first-hand how Scouting helps young people develop, during her time as a volunteer in North Wales.' He added: 'Where else, for £1.50 a week, can young people develop skills such as leadership, organisation, drive, loyalty, commitment, passion and compassion, and self-confidence? These are the attributes that young people need in order to get ahead in life. 'As we look for 1,000 adult volunteers to help us launch 200 new Scout groups, we are working to make it as easy as possible for adults to fit volunteering in around their busy lives – this is how we change our society: with many people doing a little bit.' A bite to eat: Kate also had a go at eating a bit of chocolate bar using chopsticks. 'No pressure,' the Duchess muttered to herself, as the cameras were trained on her . Helping hand: Kate teaches the young girl how to use the chopsticks to pick up sweets during one activity . Proud: The little girl manages to eat a fizzy lace with her chopsticks, thanks to the help of the Duchess who is clearly pleased with her efforts . Surprise visitor: The children had not been told beforehand that the Duchess was coming and when she arrived, one older Scout shouted out: 'Oh my God, it's Princess Kate' Kate was shown around by Carlos Lopez-Plandolit, the Beaver Scout colony leader, who became a volunteer about a year ago after coming to Britain five years ago from Spain to work for a technology company. 'It's the most exciting thing that happened to me in five years,' said Carlos, 31. 'Scout groups like the one that the Duchess is visiting this evening give young people access to some fantastic opportunities that they might not have access to otherwise. Under instruction: Kate helped guide the hands of Fynley Gooch, 7, as he sat with a neckerchief covering his face and tried to squeeze icing over a fairy cake . Offering support: The Duchess holds the chocolate cake still so the young boy can decorate the treat without making a mess . No peeking! Kate laughs as she lifts the Scout's blindfold to make sure he is not peeking as he tries to ice the chocolate cake . 'As someone who had never considered volunteering with The Scout Association until recently, I can’t recommend it enough. 'It’s a brilliant experience for those who love adventure and working with young people. Being a volunteer changed my life and I am proud I can change the life of the young people in the community in which I live and work.' The children had not been told beforehand that the Duchess was coming and when she arrived, one older Scout shouted out: 'Oh my God, it's Princess Kate.' She was quickly given a UK Scouts scarf of the 23rd Poplar group tied in a friendship knot and got down to activities with the children, practising learning how to use sign language to say the Scout Promise. The Duchess helped one group of children put on blindfolds to simulate blindness but did not have a go herself at that stage. At the next table, however, she certainly got stuck in, joining a group of Beavers trying to cut up and eat Mars Bars using boxing gloves to simulate those with mobility or coordination problems. Taking part: At the final table, Kate sat with a group of children trying to put icing on some fairy cakes while blindfolded. She used her Scout scarf to cover her face and show the children what they needed to do . Changing places: After finishing Fynley's cake, Kate had a go at being blindfolded and he took his turn to guide her in decorating the cake .

After finishing Fynley's cake, Kate had a go at being blindfolded and he took his turn to guide her in decorating the cake. Fynley turned out to be not as patient as Kate, however, and at one stage walked off. Carlos, the Beavers' leader spotted him making a break for it. 'It's OK, he's here,' he said, returning Fynley to the Duchess. 'Can you tell me please when he walks away,' Kate said, giggling. When she had completed her cake decorating, Kate joined the 20 Beavers sitting in a circle and then, when everyone stood up, went around the circle, presenting each with a disability awareness badge. 'Well done,' she told each Beaver. 'Oh my gosh, look at all your badges,' she said to one. 'How many? Have you been counting them?' Then Kate joined all the Beavers in using sign language to say the Scout's Promise - 'I promise to do my best, to be kind and helpful and to love my world' - before singing along to their farewell song 'Goodnight Beavers'. After she had left, Carlos said: 'It was amazing. She's really spontaneous. She's naturally gifted with children. I think she had a great time.'","Duchess of Cambridge visited 23rd Poplar Beaver Scout Colony in east London to help children earn a badge .

"As Apple's antitrust case enters its final stages, a former engineer has revealed the firm deliberately blocked rivals' music from its iPods (pictured) After just a few hours of deliberation, a jury in California has found in favour of Apple in a billion-dollar class-action lawsuit over the price of its iPod music players. The eight-member jury in U.S. District Court rejected a claim by attorneys for consumers and iPod resellers, who argued that Apple's use of restrictive software froze out competing makers of portable music players. Apple had argued that the software provided necessary security protection. However, the jury said Apple's iTunes 7.0, released in the fall of 2006, was a 'genuine product improvement,' meaning that new features were good for consumers . Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they plan to appeal. 'We're glad we got this to the jury,' said attorney Bonny Sweeney, who had argued on behalf of the estimated 8 million consumers who purchased iPods from 2006 to 2009. But she asserted that a ruling by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, kept the jury from considering the full effect of the iTunes software update that was the focus of the trial. The case was filed nearly ten years ago and dates to a time when Apple used anti-piracy software that prevented its iPods from playing songs that were downloaded from online outlets that competed with Apple's iTunes stores. 'We thank the jury for their service and we applaud their verdict,' Apple said in a statement. 'We created iPod and iTunes to give our customers the world's best way to listen to music. 'Every time we've updated those products — and every Apple product over the years — we've done it to make the user experience even better.' As Apple's billion-dollar antitrust case entered its final stages, a former engineer earlier this week claimed the tech giant deliberately blocked rivals' music from its iPods. Rod Schultz, who worked as a senior software engineer at Apple between 2006 and 2008, said he worked on a project 'intended to block 100 per cent of non-iTunes clients.' The project was also set up to 'keep out third-party players' that competed with Apple's iPod, according to the Wall Street Journal. Mr Schultz was subpoenaed by the prosecution to prove Apple restricted rival music on its iPods, which ultimately pushed up the prices of the devices. Apple is accused of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market, and only earlier this month lawyers claimed the firm deliberately deleted rivals' song from iPods. The case went to trial in California last month, after being filed a decade ago. Plaintiffs are claiming Apple's restrictive software froze out competitors and allowed it to sell iPods at inflated prices. They are seeking $350 million (£224m) in damages, which could be tripled if the jury finds Apple broke federal anti-trust law. Apple stopped using the particular software in question in 2009, which means the lawsuit only covers iPod models bought between September 2006 and March 2009. Mr Schultz, who worked on Digital Rights Management (DRM), security and data encryption for iTunes and iPods during this time at the firm, said he was an 'unwilling witness' and was not happy about discussing his work, codenamed Candy. Apple, and Mr Schultz, claimed the aim of the project was to improve iTunes and protect its users from malware and other threats caused by downloading non-iTunes music. They added it was not the firm's intention to stifle competition. Earlier in the trial, the prosecution told the court that  Apple deleted songs from iPods that had been bought from rival music stores. Each time an Apple user with non-iTunes music tried to sync their devices, between 2007 and 2009, the tech firm  urged them to restore the players to factory settings.

And the lawyers claimed this was a deliberate move to wipe the rival files, and cause the users' music libraries to 'blow up.' But Apple insisted the move was a legitimate security measure. The court case was almost dismissed earlier this month when the judge disqualified one of the claimants because her iPod wasn't bought during the time period detailed in the case. The other claimant withdrew her claims. But 65-year-old Massachusetts business consultant Barbara Bennet read about the floundering case online and volunteered to represent consumers in the suit. US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has repeatedly shown impatience with the attorneys for not doing a better job of vetting the original named claimant in the case, who are supposed to represent the 'class of affected consumers'. 'We shouldn't have been here in the first place,' Rogers said as attorneys on both sides debated how to proceed Tuesday morning. A video testimony of late Apple boss Steve Jobs was played earlier in the trial, filmed six months before his death in 2011. In the testimony, Mr Jobs defended the software and said: 'We were very scared' of the prospect that hackers could break Apple's security system. He added that this might jeopardise Apple's contracts with music recording companies that didn't want their songs to be pirated. 'We would get nasty emails from the labels,' he added.

"Resignation: Cecil Rex Ard has stepped down as the mayor of Webb following his arrest last month . The mayor of a small Alabama town has quit after he was arrested as part of a massive prostitution sting last month. Cecil Rex Ard, 69, the mayor of Webb, was one of 12 men arrested in the operation in late November by the Dothan Police Department. He continued to serve his first term as mayor until Monday night, when the Webb Town Council officially accepted his resignation. In his place, the council then appointed Councilman Eddie Hamm as the new mayor of the Houston County town of 1,400 people, the Dothan Eagle reported. Hamm and the council declined to comment after the meeting on Monday night, and would not comment after Ard was arrested on November 25. Ard, who served on the council before he was elected to mayor, faces a misdemeanor charge of soliciting prostitution. Authorities were tight-lipped about the nature of their investigation, but such operations generally involve undercover officers posing as prostitutes, Dothan First reported.

"Reverend Al Sharpton has blasted Sony executive Amy Pascal over racially charged comments that were made public in her hacked emails - and says it's part of an overwhelming problem of lack of diversity in Hollywood. 'Right now, Hollywood is like the Rocky Mountains. The higher up it goes, the whiter it looks,' he quipped to TMZ. Sharpton and two other black leaders are meeting with Pascal at her request after she was forced to apologize for comments she made about President Barack Obama in leaked emails. Scroll down for video . Al Sharpton says the comments revealed in Amy Pascal's hacked emails are part of a much wider problem with lack of diversity in Hollywood . He told TMZ it won't be easy for the embattled Sony Pictures co-chairman to avoid his condemnation. 'If people have a culture of acting like it's OK to joke about the President of the United States only watching black movies - this is what are were saying in 2014,' Sharpton said. He added: 'I don't know who's behind the hack. I know what I've read about the hack. And I'm going to give her a lot of heck about the hack.' Pascal, it was revealed, joked with film producer Scott Rubin over email about what she talk to President Barack Obama about during a breakfast meeting. Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal is fighting for her job and has been forced to apologize for the contents of her hacked emails . She then offers that the president probably liked 'Django Unchained' - a violent film about a slave freeing himself. Mr Rubin counters with '12 Years a Slave' and then 'Ride-along.' 'Ride-along. I bet he likes Kevin Hart,' Mr Rubin writes. RadarOnline also reports that in one email she says TV deals are the new 'black baby' in Hollywood -which Radar says is a jab at stars who adopt African and African American children. Pascal has asked to meet with Sharpton, as well as the head of the Urban League and the head of the NAACP in an effort to smooth over her comments. Pascal was responsible for greenlighting the new 'Annie' film featuring black leads - including in the title role . However, Sharpton says that matters little if none of the top executives in Hollywood are diverse. 'That's product, that's selling to consumers,' he said. 'Who makes the decisions? Who does the budgets? Who writes the checks? That's what we want to know.'","Amy Pascal has asked to meet with Sharpton and two other black leaders to discuss her comments .

"They can’t lay claim to morning sickness, sleepless nights or swollen feet. But it seems that fathers-to-be do suffer at least one symptom of pregnancy. Research shows that men’s hormones go into a spin in the months before becoming a parent for the first time. Scroll down for video . Fathers-to-be suffer at least one symptom of pregnancy - a dip in two key hormones. A fall in testosterone may make men less aggressive and more caring. A drop in oestradiol helps prepare them for new responsibilities . The prospect of fatherhood brings with it a dip in two key hormones. The changes may help men prepare for bonding with their babies – as well as stop them from straying. In these most detailed study of its kind, US researchers measured hormone levels in 29 couples at four points during pregnancy. All four hormones – testosterone, cortisol, progesterone and oestradiol, a form of the sex hormone oestrogen – shot up in the women. Amounts of testosterone and oestradiol fell in the men. Levels of the other two hormones did not change, the American Journal of Human Biology reports. The surge in women’s hormones in pregnancy has been well-researched but this study is the first to look in detail at men’s hormones. University of Michigan researcher Robin Edelstein said: ‘Other studies have shown that men’s hormones change once they become fathers. 'But our findings suggest that these changes may begin even earlier, during the transition to fatherhood. The changes may help men prepare for bonding with their babies – as well as stop them from straying . ‘We don’t yet know exactly why men’s hormones are changing. 'These changes could be a function of the psychological changes that men experience as they prepare to become fathers, changes in romantic relationships or even physical changes that men experience along with their pregnant partners.’ A fall in testosterone, for instance, may make men less aggressive and more caring. It may also be nature’s way of keeping them faithful to their partner. A drop in oestradiol may also help prepare men for their new responsibilities. It seems, however, that men are pretty relaxed about fatherhood. Cortisol and progesterone – the two hormones that did not rise in the men as the birth become closer – both go up when stressed.","The prospect of fatherhood brings with it a dip in two key hormones .

"No justice: It was revealed Tuesday that dozens of suspected criminals were released in Detroit, because the county prosecutor's office, headed by Kym Worthy (pictured), failed to sign warrants in time . A shocking new report shows that dozens of suspected rapists, murderers and child abusers were released back onto the streets of Detroit in the last four years, because county prosecutors didn't sign warrants in time to keep the accused behind bars. The Detroit News reports that the office's backlog of outstanding warrants goes back to 2010, and includes 21 for murder, 105 for sexual assault and 126 for child abuse. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy explained the chilling statistic, saying budget cuts have whittled down her staff who are now struggling to keep up with the cases. 'I have been saying for two years what would happen if our budget was cut,' Worthy told the Detroit News. 'We have lost half of our staff and it is no surprise that we are not able to fulfill our mandated functions with such drastic staff reductions.' In one especially sobering example, a rapist was released after prosecutors failed to sign a warrant and he went on to assault three more women. Detroit Police arrested Jamieson Kelley in September 2011 after a woman claimed he raped her at his apartment. Police believed the woman's account since Kelley had been released from prison just three months earlier after finishing a 10-year sentence for sexual assault. Furthermore,  the victim was able to identify Kelley from a photo line-up and confirm his address. But because the case was based on 'one person's word against another' prosecutors decided they didn't have a strong enough case and did not sign the warrant, letting Kelley go free. He went on to rape three more women in 2013 and 2014, and was eventually arrested again. Most infuriating for the police, when it came time for Kelley's trial this year, they asked the original 2011 victim to testify, despite the fact that they found her too 'unreliable' three years prior. Disappointment: The slow work of the prosecutor's office has made Detroit Police Chief James Craig's (pictured) job difficult, as his officers are constantly having to release suspected criminals they worked hard to arrest . 'If they're saying it's something we should've done in our investigation, that's one thing,' Detroit Police Chief James Craig told the News. 'But if we're talking about a witness not being credible, how can they then turn around and use that same witness in a later case? Either she's credible or she isn't.' Kelley pleaded guilty to rape charges in November and was sentenced to between 22 and half to 50 years in prison, but Craig hates the fact that the additional rapes could have been prevented. 'We believed we arrested the right suspect, and it turned out we were right. This man is a predator who was allowed to go back and rape more women.' Cases like Kelley's have led to a rift between prosecutors and the police, who are constantly having to release inmates they have worked hard to jail because of the prosecutors' slow work. The suspects who were released in the last four years were arrested by police, but let go after prosecutors failed to formally arraign them within the required 72 hours. Worthy says keeping up is impossible with her staff severely cut down in the bankrupt city's budget crisis.  The office currently has 154 staff attorneys, after losing 90 more this year in the latest round of cuts, spokesman Maria Miller said. In 2010, the Warrant's division had eight full-time attorneys and two to three project consultants. Now the office has just five full-time attorneys, with one who works an abbreviated 32 hours a week and a part-timer. While Chief Craig is sympathetic to the budget cuts, he says he is pressed with the same issues and still has to continue his department as usual. However, the prosecutor's office points out that some of the issues with the warrants go back to police not doing enough investigative work.  Miller says cases are commonly sent back for further interviews, forensic analysis or evidence that wasn't provided. 'Over the last year, we have seen an increase across the board for Detroit cases that must be returned for further work,' Miller said. 'Prosecutor Worthy estimates that a fourth of all DPD cases across the entire office are returned for further investigation.' In addition to the unsigned warrants, the Detroit police also have a backlog of 11,000 untested rape kits which were discovered in 2009. Lawless: A view of Detroit, Michigan, where local authorities are struggling to prosecute criminals due to staffing cuts .","Report shows unsigned warrants going back to 2010 include 21 for murder, 105 for sexual assault and 126 for child abuse .

"The age at which girls start their first menstrual cycle may impact their risk of heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure new research has found. Women who begin menstruating before age 10 or after age 17 may have a higher risk of heart disease, stroke or high blood pressure than those who begin in the intervening years, according to a new study. Menarche, the onset of first full menstrual cycle, tends to occur earlier in obese children, so the link between earlier periods and later heart disease risk was expected, said lead author Dr. Dexter Canoy of the University of Oxford in the U.K. Women who begin menstruating before age 10 or after age 17 may have a higher risk of heart disease, stroke or high blood pressure than those who begin in the intervening years, according to a new study. Researchers studied health data for more than one million U.K. women ages 50 to 64, including reproductive and medical history and national data on deaths and hospitalizations over the subsequent decade. Over the course of about 11 years, almost 250,000 women were hospitalized for or died from complications of high blood pressure, 73,000 developed heart disease and more than 25,000 had suffered a stroke. Those who had their first period at age 13, about 25 percent of the group, had the lowest risk of heart problems during the study. But his team was surprised to find another increase in risk for older age at menarche, he told Reuters Health by email. 'Menarche, onset of first full menstrual cycle, is a marker of puberty and the onset of endocrine functions relating to reproduction, but why the timing of menarche is associated with increased vascular disease risk remains unclear,' Canoy said. Researchers studied health data for more than one million U.K. women ages 50 to 64, including reproductive and medical history and national data on deaths and hospitalizations over the subsequent decade. Over the course of about 11 years, almost 250,000 women were hospitalized for or died from complications of high blood pressure, 73,000 developed heart disease and more than 25,000 had suffered a stroke. Those who had their first period at age 13, about 25 percent of the group, had the lowest risk of heart problems during the study. Compared to those women, the four percent who reported having their first period at age 10 or younger were about 27 percent more likely to develop heart disease. Heart disease risk increased almost as much for the one percent of women who started menstruating at age 17 or older, according to data in the journal Circulation. Stroke and high blood pressure patterns were similar, but the increases in risk were smaller than for heart disease, the authors write. 'This is a very interesting paper confirming previous association studies showing links between early menarche and cardiovascular disease risk,' said David Dunger, a pediatric clinical scientist at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. who was not involved in the new study. But previous studies have not included such a large group of women, he told Reuters Health by email. Those who had their first period at age 13, about 25 percent of the group, had the lowest risk of heart problems during the study. Compared to those women, the four percent who reported having their first period at age 10 or younger were about 27 percent more likely to develop heart disease. The risks remained even when the authors accounted for body size, smoking and socioeconomic status, Canoy said. These findings are likely applicable to middle-aged Caucasian women born between 1930 and 1950 in industrialized countries, Canoy said. The women in the current study were mostly white. Researchers need to see whether the findings are similar in women of different ethnicities or from less industrialized countries, he added. Heart disease risk was slightly different for women whose first period came at age 12 compared to those who started at age 15, but so small as to likely be clinically unimportant, he said. 'Strategies to prevent excess weight gain during childhood may also avoid menarche occurring at an earlier age than necessary, which in turn could reduce the risk of developing heart disease and stroke in the long-term,' Canoy said. Average age at menarche has been on the decline since the late 1800s, Canoy noted. 'What is currently unexplained is whether the timing of menarche per se is somehow what is crucial or is there another factor occurring/operating at around middle-age (which might happen to be a correlate of age at menarche) that increases susceptibility to the development of heart disease,' Canoy said.","Women who begin menstruating before age 10 or after age 17 may have a higher risk of heart disease, stroke or high blood pressure than those who begin in the intervening years .

"Channing Tatum wants to star in a new Ghostbusters franchise, according to the latest hacked emails from Sony Pictures. In the emails, which were leaked in a November 24 cyber-attack on the studio, Tatum told Sony co-chairman, Amy Pascal, that he should star in a reboot of the 1984 classic - and that it could have the same audience appeal of Christopher Nolan's Batman franchise. In an August email, the Magic Mike star, expressed abundant enthusiasm for the remake which would also star Chris Pratt. Scroll down for video . Channing Tatum (left) is reportedly keen to star in a Ghostbusters movie remake, according to emails from the Sony hack, with Chris Pratt (right) as a co-star . The original: Channing Tatum told bosses at Sony he wanted a lead role in a remake of Ghostbusters, originally made in 1984 starring (from left) Harold Ramis, Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd . According to The Hollywood Reporter, Tatum's message read: 'Let us show the world The DarkSide and let us fight it with all the glory and epicness of a HUGE BATMAN BEGINS MOVIE. 'I know we can make this a huge franchise. Fun adventure craziness. COME OONNNN!!!' A follow-up email from Columbia Pictures co-president of production Hannah Minghella, added that directors Anthony and Joe Russo, who worked on The Avengers and Captain America, wanted to get involved. Minghella allegedly wrote: 'The Russos, Channing and [Tatum's producing partner] Reid [Carolin] have been brainstorming ideas and want to create a whole new mythology that would support multiple movies (the way that [Christopher] Nolan reinvented Batman).' According to THR, the Russos wanted Paul Feig, who is directing a Ghostbusters movie with women in the leading roles, to also direct their Tatum and Pratt version. According to reports, Sony execs were excited about the concept - including Pascal, who responded: 'F***.' News of an all-female Ghostbusters cast was also leaked during the security breach - and director Feig planned to make it 'scarier and more hi-tech' than the Eighties version, starring Harold Ramis, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver. The director reportedly hoped that Games Of Throne star Peter Dinklage would play the villain 'who returns as a ghost after his execution'. In the original movie, the ghost of dead librarian terrifies the ghost-busting crew after she transforms into a gruesome monster. Cecily Strong, SNL cast member, was also being lined up for an 'antagonistic' starring role. Pascal's excitement for the alleged Ghostbusters project wasn't mirrored in her reaction in another email about director Cameron Crowe's rom-com starring Bradley Cooper. The untitled movie stars Cooper as a military contractor who falls in love with an Air Force officer played by Emma Stone. Peter Dinklage (left) was being lined up to star as the villain in another Ghostbusters reboot with a leading female cast, alongside SNL's Cecily Strong (right) Rachel McAdams, Alec Baldwin, Bill Murray, John Krasinski and Danny McBride have all signed on to play supporting characters, according to Gawker. Pascal wrote: 'I'm never starting a movie again when the script is ridiculous. I don't care how much I love the director and the actors. It never, not even once, ever works. She also criticized director Crowe for not changing the script after test audiences responded negatively: 'People don't like people in movies who flirt with married people or married people who flirt.' On November 24, Sony Pictures Entertainment computers were hacked. According to reports, hackers attacked the company relating to the release of The Interview, a movie starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, where a celebrity journalist lands an interview with North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-Il, and becomes part of a plan to assassinate him. Other highly sensitive material from the Sony hacking is being leaked almost daily, including exchanges between Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin and Sony co-chairman Amy Pascal that contained a frank assessment of Angelina Jolie's talent and racially offensive jokes about Obama's presumed taste in movies.","Tatum emailed about Ghostbusters remake, saying: ''I know we can make this a huge franchise.

"Guilty: Gurminder Singh, 29, (pictured) has been jailed for life after he murdered his lover Amandeep Kaur Hothi after he discovered she was married . A jilted boyfriend was jailed for life today for murdering his lover by slashing her throat in a hotel room after he discovered she was already married. Gurminder Singh, 29, attacked Amandeep Kaur Hothi after luring her to a hotel in Wolverhampton, West Midlands on March 5 last year. A terrified Mrs Hothi had called her husband telling him 'I'm dying', but neither he nor police were able to find her in time. Singh stayed with her  body for 24 hours before eventually dialling 9999 and telling the operator he had self-harmed. When paramedics arrived at the Britannia Hotel, they found Singh lying on the bed with a cut to his throat having tried to kill himself. The body of the mother-of-two, who had also had her throat cut, was found on the floor. Singh had denied murder but was found guilty by a jury at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Today he was jailed for life and told he would serve a minimum of 24 years. During the trial, the court heard Mrs Hothi, from Wolverhampton, embarked on an affair with Singh, from Forest Gate, London, a year before her death. She told him her name was Simran Sandhu and used a second mobile phone to communicate with him so her husband, Pal Singh, would not find out about the affair. Robert Price, prosecuting, told the court Singh flipped when she tried to break off their relationship in order to 'guarantee that if he could not have her, then nobody else could.' A distraught Mr Singh told the jury how he heard his wife screaming for help as she was murdered. 'She told me she had got mixed up with a guy,' the factory worker had told the jury. 'I was at work and the machines were on. She could have said ""I’m dying"". 'She screamed as she spoke, I thought she was under attack and was very anxious but I did not know where she was.' Speaking after the case, he said: 'Our family has been left devastated and traumatised by the events of the 5 and 6 March this year. 'We are heartbroken by the loss of Amandeep. Scene: Singh  lured Mrs Hothi to the Britannia Hotel in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, where he attacked her . 'We are pleased the person responsible has been found guilty. The court trial has been difficult and distressing emotionally for us to endure. 'The family is rallying together to look after Amandeep’s two young sons and we now want to be left alone to grieve and to come to terms with all that has happened.' Martin Lindop from the Crown Prosecution service described the case as 'tragic'. He said: 'This is a very tragic case where a young woman has entered into a relationship which has ultimately ended up costing her life and two young children losing their mother. 'Gurminder Singh was unable to accept the fact that the victim wanted to break off their relationship, but he persuaded the victim to meet him. 'Armed with a knife, he travelled up to Wolverhampton to meet Mrs Hothi. 'The defendant took the victim back to his hotel room, where he attacked her with the knife. 'Mrs Hothi tried to call her husband for help, but he and the police were unable to locate her. 'Singh then tried to commit suicide, but failing this, he called the emergency services for help, medical help which he denied Mrs Hothi.

"A new survey shows just how little diversity there is in the fashion world, especially when it comes to magazine covers. The Fashion Spot assessed 44 major print publications across the globe to determine which magazines did and did not feature models from a minority background on their cover at some point in 2014. It found a shocking lack of diversity across the board, with white models appearing 567 times out of 611 total covers and people of colour appearing just 119 times. Scroll down for video . Discrepancy: A new survey of 44 major print magazines has found a shocking lack of diversity, with white models appearing 567 times out of 611 total covers this year and people of color appearing just 119 times . Surprising ratio: That means that white women have been chosen as cover stars nearly five times as often as non-white women have made the cut . That means that white women were chosen as cover stars nearly five times more often than non-white women made the cut. Of the magazines surveyed, a number of them failed to use a woman of minority on the cover at all, including Harper’s Bazaar U.S. and UK, Vogue UK, Vogue Netherlands, Vogue Paris, Vogue Ukraine, Vogue Russia, Teen Vogue, Numéro, LOVE and Porter. And according to the survey, Vogue UK is the biggest disappointment when it comes to representing minorities. In fact, the magazine has not featured a model of color on the cover in a whopping 12 years, the last instance being Naomi Campbell's appearance in 2002. That being said, Vogue UK has featured several non-white celebrities of color over the years, including Beyonce in May 2013 and Rhianna in November 2011. Lack of representation: Neither LOVE (left,  Fall/winter 2014 issue) nor Harper's Bazaar UK (right, September 2014 issue) has chosen a single cover model of color this year . Pattern: Vogue Korea (left, May 2014 issue) and Vogue Japan (right, July 2014 issue) also overwhelmingly chose white models for the cover, with Vogue Japan only featuring one model of Japanese descent all year . But when it comes to cover girls who are professional models, they all have been white. Even Jourdan Dunn - who was named Model of the Year at the British Fashion Awards in 2008 and was the first black British model to make Forbes' top-earning models list in 2014 - has never landed a solo Vogue UK cover. Jourdan did appear on the cover with Eden Clark and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley on the November 2008 issue, but she is yet to star on the cover without any other models. Meanwhile, her close pal Cara Delevingne has been on the cover of British Vogue twice this year alone, as has 40-year-old supermodel Kate Moss. By the numbers: This graph shows that black models were the minority that was best represented on magazine covers, followed by those from an Asian background . Vogue Japan and Vogue Korea also overwhelmingly chose white models to appear on their covers in 2014, with Vogue Japan only featuring one model of Japanese descent all year. They did, however, choose Puerto Rican beauty Joan Smalls for their December 2014 cover. The glossy magazines who best represented minorities on the cover this year were Vogue India and Vogue Taiwan, the first of which used exclusively models of color in 2014. Most of Vogue Taiwan's 2014 cover models were also women of color, although for the May cover they picked Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr.","Harper's Bazaar U.S. and UK, Vogue UK, Vogue Netherlands, Vogue Paris, Vogue Ukraine, Vogue Russia, Teen Vogue, Numéro, LOVE and Porter all failed to use a woman of color on the cover at all in 2014 .

"Hockey's biggest star, Sidney Crosby, has been stricken with the mumps - one at least 20 players who came down with highly infectious virus in the last few weeks. The National Hockey League is struggling to contain the spread of the illness, which is usually not dangerous to healthy adults but is incredibly contagious. Players on at least six teams have missed games after being infected. Crosby appeared in front of reporters on Friday with one side of his face swollen - a telltale sign of the mumps. The Penguins said an earlier mumps test turned up negative and that they thought the swelling was the result of an injury. Telltale: Sidney Crosby, the NHL's biggest star, show the puffy face on Friday (left) that is common among people infected with mumps (pictured right without the illness) Team doctors believed the swelling in Crosby's face was due to an injury. He will miss at least three days as the virus runs its course . Crosby's Pittsburgh Penguins teammate Beau Bennett  has come down with a suspected case of the mumps just days after he visited sick kids at a children's hospital with his team. Bennett is being tested for the virus and doctors fear he may have exposed the children, many of whom have compromised immune systems, to the virulent illness. At least one child at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh has been quarantined. Crosby will miss at least three games before he is allowed to return to the ice, according to ESPN. Players from the New York Rangers, New Jersey Devils, Minnesota Wild, Anaheim Ducks and St Louis Blues are believed to have come down with the virus. An infected person can be contagious for weeks before showing signs of the illness - which includes swelling of the salivary glands, fatigue, muscle aches and fever. Mumps, which is usually associated with childhood illness, spreads by coming in contact with an infected person's saliva. And the NHL outbreak is particularly troubling because it has been able to spread despite recent vaccinations. Unfortunate: Penguins player Beau Bennett is pictured during a charity visit to Children's Hospital - just five days before he was quarantined with a suspected case of the illness . Bennett (left) and Crosby (right) are two of the latest victims of an outbreak that is proving resistant to vaccination. At least six teams have had players fall ill . Crosby, whose mumps results were confirmed on Monday, received a booster shot of the vaccine last year before he traveled to Russia for the Olympics, team officials said. Other players who were infected had gotten booster shots this year. Hockey is an ideal environment for mumps to spread. It's a full-contact sport where players share towels and water bottles. League officials are offering booster shots and vaccinations to players, team officials and referees, They are also educating players about how the disease is spread and working to eliminate the sharing of water bottles and other objects that can spread the virus.","Pittsburgh Penguins star Beau Bennett came down with mumps symptoms five days after visiting sick kids at Pittsburgh's Children's Hospital .

"Brothers Brad and Dallas Woodhouse share the same DNA but when it comes to politics, the two couldn't be more different, and on Tuesday, when their partisan differences were on full display during a televised debate, their mother Joy unexpectedly called in to ask them to stop fighting. 'I'm your mother and I disagree that all families are like ours. I don't know many families that are fighting at Thanksgiving,' she said, scolding her political operative sons. 'I was very glad that this Thanksgiving was the year that you two were supposed to go to your in-laws, and I'm hoping you'll have some of this out of your systems when you come here for Christmas.'

Before that he worked as the director of the Tar Heel State's Americans for Prosperity chapter. His brother, Brad, is accomplished in his own right, having founded progressive group Americans United for Change and worked as the communications director at the Democratic National Committee. He now serves as president of political action group American Bridge. The siblings' unusual relationship was the subject of a documentary released earlier this fall aptly called Woodhouse Divided. 'I’m the Democrat, he’s the wing nut – he was dropped on his head as a child,' Brad told attendees of the Washington, D.C. premiere of the film in September. The documentary covered a four-year span of the brothers' lives and included scenes of them defying their mother and arguing at holiday gatherings. Longing for a drama-free Christmas get-together this year, she called into C-SPAN's Washington Journal program this morning to reproach her sons, who were on the cable channel to discuss whether 'bipartisanship is good for governing.' The show's host had just finished teasing them about the heated back and forth they were having when he informed them that a caller named 'Joy' from Raleigh, North Carolina, was on the line for them. 'Hey, somebody from down south!' Dallas said excitedly. 'You're right I'm from down south!' the voice on the line barked at him. 'Oh, God. It's mom,' he said a moment later, burying his head in his hands. Joy Woodhouse called into C-SPAN this morning while her boys - who couldn't have more different political views - were on the television channel having a heated discussion about bipartisanship . 'They're both very passionate about what they believe in, and I love that about them,' she said. 'But I hope that they just kind of get this out of their system today on your program.' Brad told her, laughing, 'That is wishful thinking' At one point during his mother's rant about their bickering, Dallas tried to jump in, but his brother cut him off and said, 'Let your momma talk.' When she had finished, she told them, 'I would really like a peaceful Christmas. And I love you both.' Taking advantage of the opportunity to chat with dueling political operatives' mother, the program's host asked Joy what it was like to raise the two brothers. 'Well it hadn't been easy,' she candidly responded. This time it was Brad's turn to say, 'Oh god.' 'We love you mom,' Dallas told her. 'They're both very passionate about what they believe in, and I love that about them,' she said. 'But I hope that they just kind of get this out of their system today on your program.' 'Ain't no way that happens,' Dallas said. 'That is wishful thinking,' Brad told her, laughing.","Brothers Brad and Dallas Woodhouse were on C-SPAN having a debate about whether bipartisanship is good for governing .

"The New York teenager who gained overnight fame after telling a reporter he had made $72million trading stocks on his lunch breaks at school has apologized on video for 'making it all up'. Mohammed Islam, 17, a Stuyvesant High School senior, told New York magazine's Jessica Pressler that he had earned millions of dollars by trading oil and gold futures, and small to mid-cap equities . But after the magazine ran the interview and his story made international headlines, the student quickly backtracked, hiring a pricey crisis PR firm and battle-tested attorneys to spread the word. Now, he has released a video, via 5WPR, saying he is 'sorry for anyone who may have been hurt' and that he simply 'gave into [the reporter's] pressures of wanting more and more and more'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Apology: Mohammed Islam - who gained overnight fame after telling a reporter he had made $72million trading stocks on his school lunch breaks  - has released a video (above) in which he apologizes for 'making it all up' Going back: Mohammed (pictured center, in glasses) told New York magazine's Jessica Pressler that he had earned millions of dollars by trading oil and gold futures on his lunch breaks at Stuyvesant High School . In the footage, Mohammed, dressed in a suit, said: 'I am sorry for anyone who may have been hurt by this story.Most of all I’m sorry for the embarrassment and the pressure I’ve caused my family. 'My dad's always taught me to be truthful and I went against everything he said, and I can't even speak properly to him anymore. He continued: 'I've always dreamed of one day starting a business and becoming wealthy, but at the age of 17, I spend my recreational time doing simulated trades. 'While I’ve had really successful simulated trades, my financial prowess has not been practiced and fine tuned in the real world.' The teenager dismissed the magazine's claim he had used his enormous fortune to purchase a Manhattan apartment and a BMW, saying: 'I live with my family in Queens.' He added he had been 'naturally excited' by the chance to feature in New York magazine, and 'did not realize' the consequences of 'giving into the pressure' and 'pretending to be someone I'm not'. Coming clean: After the magazine ran the interview and his story made international headlines, the student (left) quickly backtracked, hiring a pricey crisis PR firm and battle-tested attorneys to spread the word . Apology: Now, Mohammed has released a video, via 5WPR, apologizing for his actions. It comes just hours after New York magazine issued its own apology (pictured), admitting it had been 'duped' by the teenager . Mohammed's apology comes just hours after New York magazine issued its own apology to it readers, admitting it had been 'duped' by the teenager. In a statement, the magazine said: 'As part of the research process, the magazine sent a fact-checker to Stuyvesant, where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight-figure bank account. 'After the story's publication, people questioned the $72 million figure in the headline, which was written by editors based on the rumored figure. The headline was amended. Criticized: The writer of the article, Jessica Pressler, has come under fire for failing to fact check . 'But in an interview with the New York Observer last night, Islam now says his entire story was made up. A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified.' It concluded: 'We were duped. Our fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better. New York apologizes to our readers.' Hours after the magazine's interview with Mohammed - president of the Stuyvesant's investment club - was picked up by global news outlets on Sunday, the student came clean. Surrounded by his new PR and legal entourage, Mohammed told the New York Observer that not only was his supposed $72million fortune false, but he has never made any money in the stock market at all. '[I led her to believe] I had made even more than $72 million on the simulated trades,' he said. Mohammed's comments sparked a wave of online criticism, with many social media users and other journalists accusing Ms Pressler of failing to carry out appropriate fact checks for her article. The Observer's Ken Kurson wrote: 'Even if this working-class kid had somehow started with $100,000 as a high school freshman on day one at Stuy High, he’d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796% over the three years since. C’mon, man.' Helaine Olen of the Pacific Standard  demanded via Twitter that Ms Pressler came up with some answers to how she and her publication managed to pass off the seeming impossibility as fact. 'OK. Here goes ... did he show statements? I have a 15 yr old so I want to believe,' Olen tweeted. Not a multi-millionaire: Surrounded by his PR and legal entourage, Mohammed told the New York Observer that not only was his supposed $72million fortune false, but he has never made any money in the stock market . Fighting back: In response to the Observer's article, Ms Pressler claimed she saw statements backing up the rumors about Islam's wealth. But he argued they were only rumors and he's never even traded a stock . Defending her work: The online bickering began when the New York Post picked up the story and ran it as fact. Above, Ms Pressler appears to hit back at the Post's version of the article, tweeting 'MY story is true' Ms Pressler responded to the criticism through Twitter on Monday morning. 'We saw a bank statement confirming the eight figures, & I'm comfortable with what's in the piece,' she wrote. In the wake of the controversy New York Magazine added an editor's note to qualify their now contentious article - which was later edited to include the full apology. 'Our story portrays the $72 million figure as a rumor; the initial headline has been changed to more clearly reflect the fact that we did not know the exact figure he has made in trades,' the note said. 'However, Mohammed provided bank statements that showed he is worth eight figures, and he confirmed on the record that he’s worth eight figures.' School: Pictured is Stuyvesant High School, where Mohammed said he spent his lunch breaks trading stocks . So, as the Observer and everyone else wants to know: where did Pressler come up with the $72 million figure? In Islam's own words, 'The number’s a rumor.' Indeed, Pressler does not state the $72 million figure as fact in her original article. However, the online bickering began when the  New York Post picked up the story and ran it as fact with the captivating headline, 'High school student scores $72M playing the stock market.' 'A thing that I have learned today is that @nypost still drives a remarkable amount of international news coverage,' Ms Pressler tweeted on Monday. Talking the talk: Mohammed (pictured giving a high school TED talk) said his parents are not speaking to him . Also on Monday, Mohammed was due to appear on CNBC on Monday morning to talk about his fantastical skills on the stock market. In light of his new found infamy, that slot was canceled. Speaking to the Observer, the teenager said: 'My mom basically said she’d never talk to me. Their morals are that if I lie about it and don’t own up to it then they can no longer trust me. 'They knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and I haven’t spoken to them since.'","Mohammed Islam told New York magazine he had earned $72million .

"Kendall Jenner has made her third appearance in American Vogue, modeling a collection of cropped jackets, which are predicted to be one of next season's must-have fashion items, for the magazine's January issue. The 19-year-old model, who is currently in California preparing to celebrate the holidays with the rest of the Kardashian clan, looks like the ultimate professional as she showcases the high-end designs from big-name labels such as Givenchy and Burberry Prorsum. It is the second time in as many months that the reality star has appeared in the US edition of the fashion bible; in December, Kendall also sat down for an in-depth interview with the publication, revealing details about her 'competitive' upbringing in the Kardashian household. Scroll down for video . Fashion favorite: Kendall Jenner makes her third appearance in US Vogue this month, modeling a collection of cropped jackets including this $1,295 Edun design . Perfectionist: In the December issue of the magazine, the 19-year-old confessed that she is incredibly competitive when it comes to her career . 'I learned early that being a perfectionist and providing quality was the only way to do business,' she told reporter Emma Elwick-Bates. 'Workaholic is a good word in our house.' This time around, Kendall allows the photos do the talking as she poses up a storm in the 10-strong selection of images, which appear to have been shot on a desert-based location. Kendall's appearance in Vogue rounds off an incredibly successful year for the young model, who was last week named as social media site Tumblr's most popular model for 2014. And in addition to being shown some serious love by Vogue's Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, during the past 12 months, Kendall has appeared on numerous catwalks during Paris, New York and Milan Fashion Weeks, modeling for the likes of Balmain, Dolce & Gabbana, Bottega Veneta, Pucci, Fendi and Chanel. Earlier this month, just weeks after being revealed as the newest face of Estee Lauder, she reportedly turned down the opportunity to model in the hotly-anticipated Victoria's Secret fashion show in London. No rest for the wicked: Although Kendall is currently at home for the holidays, she clearly can't stop working, sharing this photograph of herself and make-up artists Rob Scheppy and Joyce Bonelli on a shoot . Instead, Kendall joined fellow model - and close friend - Cara Delevingne in Salzburg, Austria, where the duo walked in Chanel's Métiers d'Art Show. And while the young model is currently at home in California for the holidays, she hasn't let that slow her down, posting a picture of herself on a shoot earlier today alongside celebrity make-up artists Joyce Bonelli and Rob Scheppy. Indeed, if she carries on the way she has for the past 18 months, Kendall looks set to achieve even more success in 2015 - something she isn't afraid to embrace. 'I would always be looking at these supermodels, they were just so amazing, they were like superheroes,' she told Nightline earlier this year. 'I want to be some little girl's superhero. I want to be the best role model I can be to a little girl or a little boy or to anybody.' Cover star: This month's issue of the magazine features actress Sienna Miller on the cover .

"Oscar Pistorius faces being jailed in the same high security prison as a notorious Czech prisoner on trial for torture. The athlete is due to discover his fate on Tuesday when he is sentenced for the Valentine’s Day shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius' legal team called for the paralympian to be spared jail and placed under house arrest over fears for his safety, when they presented their case at the sentencing hearing last week. Scroll down for video . Oscar Pistorius is due to be sentenced on Tuesday for the shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . A high security cell has been prepared for Pistorius alongside a notorious Czech suspected gangster Radovan Krejcir, right, who is standing trial on charges of alleged kidnapping and torture . Krejcir is currently on trial at the High Court in Johannesburg for alleged kidnapping and torture, but is being held in a special wing at Pretoria Central Prison as he is considered a high security risk prisoner . Defence counsel Barry Roux quoted from a newspaper interview with a gang leader who had threatened to order a hit on Pistorius if he is given special treatment in prison. With prison authorities under acute pressure to guarantee the fallen track star’s safety, a meeting of senior correctional services officials met on Friday to draw up plans to keep him safe. According to South African news agency EWN, a cell has been set aside for Pistorius in a wing of just six cells at Pretoria Central prison, which is guarded by a special task force and where Radovan Krejcir is being held. Security at the wing is second only to the notorious ‘C Max’ wing - where the most dangerous inmates are held. Krejcir is currently on trial at the High Court in Johannesburg for alleged kidnapping and torture, but is being held in Pretoria as he is considered a high security risk prisoner. Pretoria Central Prison was the execution site of dozens of black political activists by South Africa's white-only apartheid government, which ended with the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994. It is now the home of apartheid death squad leader Eugene de Kock, known as 'Prime Evil', and is known for a vicious gang culture. The correctional services department on Monday denied that it was making arrangements in advance of Pistorius’ sentencing tomorrow. Pretoria Central Prison was the execution site of dozens of black political activists by South Africa's white-only apartheid government. Now it is home to the apartheid death squad leader Eugene de Kock . Pistorius, right, pictured in November 2012 with girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, who he shot dead in their home in Pretoria while she was locked in the toilet, saying that he mistook her for a possible intruder . Gerrie Nel, who prosecuted Pistorius for the murder of 29 year old Miss Steenkamp, told Judge Thokozile Masipa that the idea of the athlete serving his sentence at home under 'correctional supervision' with an order to carry out community service, was 'shocking inappropriate' for the severity of the crime he had committed. He said the double amputee’s disability should not be taken into consideration when he is sentenced and called for a minimum of ten years behind bars. The trial of Krejcir is one of the most high profile and high security South Africa has ever seen. The fugitive arrived in South Africa on a fake passport and since then a number of his business rivals and associates have died in mysterious circumstances, including German super car conversion specialist Uwe Gemballa and the owner of a string of strip clubs, ‘Lolly’ Jackson. The special arrangements come after Pistorius's legal team told the court their client faces threats from a ruthless prison gang leader is he is given preferential treatment in jail. Khalil Subjee - known as The General - said he would order 'a hit' on the double-amputee if his fame and wealth bought him an easy time behind bars. Defence lawyer Barry Roux quoted the claims from a newspaper article to argue that the athlete's life would be at risk if he was jailed for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius talks to his lawyer Barry Roux on day four of his sentencing hearing at the High Court in Pretoria . Emotional: The athlete's sister, Aimee, wipes tears from her eyes next to her aunt Lois while listening to testimony from Miss Steenkamp's cousin, Kim Martin, during the sentencing hearing . If he is jailed, it was thought the paralympian could have been sent to Kgosi Mumpuru prison in Pretoria, where feared gangs are notorious for turning new inmates into sex slaves in exchange for protection. Mr Roux said Subjee, the head of the feared 26s gang who claims to control all of South Africa's inland jail, made his threats in an interview from a prison phone box. Subjee said: 'If he thinks he is going to come here and buy his way to get computers and cellphones and a lavish lifestyle, he must know that will never happen for as long as I am around.' The criminal kingpin, who has been in and out of prison for the past 33 years, admitted he had organised similar retribution on other prisoners who had received special care, including the killer of Chris Hani - a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle. The revelations came after Miss Steenkamp's cousin made a dramatic appeal for Pistorius to be sent to prison, telling the court that he 'needs to pay for what he's done' to her family and his own. Prison life in South Africa is characterised by an elaborate system of gangs, through which much prisoner-on-prisoner violence is mediated, a report by a human rights group has found. While gang activity is common to many prison systems, South African prison gangs are distinctive. Most importantly, they have a national organisation. As such, a gang member who is transferred from one prison to another, or even released and re-imprisoned, will keep his membership and gang rank in the new prison. Stark conditions: Prisoners are lined up inside the Kgosi Mumpuru 11 Management Centre during a surprise raid by prison officials checking for drugs and other contraband. The jail is the most likely one that Oscar Pistorius will be sent to if he is given a prison term for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . The gangs have a history that predates the formation of the South African prisons department. They are not spontaneous creations in each prison, with an improvised system of membership and command. They instead have an elaborate structure, ranking and disciplinary code that mimics the militaristic structures of the South African apartheid system in general and the prison administration in particular. The three predominant gangs operating in South Africa's prisons today are the 28s, 27s and 26s, known collectively as the 'number gangs'. The 'number gangs' trace their origins, by an elaborate oral history, to the late 19th century, when gangs were formed in the all-male compounds occupied by migrant laborers working in the mines on the Witwatersrand, near Johannesburg. Grim: The athlete's lawyer has argued that there will be a risk from prison gangs if he is sent to jail . A report by Human Rights Watch found that promotion is gained by carrying out acts of violence on non gang members or rivals . The 28s are said to be the most feared, operating an organised system of 'wyfies' - or sexual partners. The 26s are known for skill at obtaining contraband items, while the 27s enforce the codes of the other two groups. Inmates who are not associated with a gang complain of having to 'buy' back their own bunk from gang members and have other possessions confiscated. And any attempts to disrupt the structure of gangs often leads to warfare within the gang and with rivals. Most worryingly, warders often turn a blind eye to gang activities and in some cases, actively collaborate with them.

"It will take about 11 trillion gallons of water (42 cubic kilometers) -- around 1.5 times the maximum volume of the largest U.S. reservoir -- to recover from California's continuing drought, according to a new analysis by Nasa. The space agency used satellite data to create an estimate of the water needed to end a drought for the first time. They say it will help planners, who recently found California's three year drought is the worst seen for over 1200 years. Scroll down for video . The dry bed of the Stevens Creek Reservoir in California: A combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall during California's three-year drought have produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years. NASA GRACE satellite data reveal the severity of California's drought on water resources across the state. This map shows the trend in water storage between September 2011 and September 2014. Image Credit: NASA JPL . The finding was presented by Nasa scientists at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco. 'Spaceborne and airborne measurements of Earth's changing shape, surface height and gravity field now allow us to measure and analyse key features of droughts better than ever before, including determining precisely when they begin and end and what their magnitude is at any moment in time,' Jay Famiglietti of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena said. 'That's an incredible advance and something that would be impossible using only ground-based observations.' A team of scientists used data from Nasa's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites to develop the first-ever calculation of this kind - the volume of water required to end an episode of drought. Earlier this year, at the peak of California's current three-year drought, the team found that water storage in the state's Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins was 11 trillion gallons below normal seasonal levels. Data collected since the launch of GRACE in 2002 shows this deficit has increased steadily. Since 2011, the Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins decreased in volume by four trillion gallons of water each year (15 cubic kilometers). That's more water than California's 38 million residents use each year for domestic and municipal purposes. About two-thirds of the loss is due to depletion of groundwater beneath California's Central Valley. In related results, early 2014 data from NASA's Airborne Snow Observatory indicate that snowpack in California's Sierra Nevada range was only half of previous estimates. The observatory is providing the first-ever high-resolution observations of snow water volume in the Tuolumne River, Merced, Kings and Lakes basins of the Sierra Nevada and Uncompahgre watershed in the Upper Colorado River Basin. To develop these calculations, the observatory measures how much water is in the snowpack and how much sunlight the snow absorbs, which influences how fast the snow melts. These data enable accurate estimates of how much water will flow out of a basin when the snow melts, which helps guide decision about reservoir filling and water allocation. The low water level of California's Lake Kaweah, February 5, 2014. Now in its third straight year of unprecedented drought, California is experiencing its driest year on record, dating back 119 years and possible the worst in the past 500 years. 'The 2014 snowpack was one of the three lowest on record and the worst since 1977, when California's population was half what it is now,' said Airborne Snow Observatory principal investigator Tom Painter of JPL. 'Besides resulting in less snow water, the dramatic reduction in snow extent contributes to warming our climate by allowing the ground to absorb more sunlight. This reduces soil moisture, which makes it harder to get water from the snow into reservoirs once it does start snowing again.' New drought maps show groundwater levels across the U.S. Southwest are in the lowest two to 10 percent since 1949. A combination of . record high temperatures and sparse rainfall during California's . three-year drought have produced the worst conditions in 1,200 . years, according to a study accepted for publication by the . American Geophysical Union (AGU). 'The current California drought is exceptionally severe in . the context of at least the last millennium and is driven by . reduced though not unprecedented precipitation and record high . temperatures,' the report's authors said in the study released . late Thursday. The study by the University of Minnesota and the Woods Hole . Oceanographic Institution said that warm, dry conditions have . shrunk the supply of surface water from reservoirs, streams and . the Sierra Nevada snowpack in the state, even as demand from . people and farms has gone up, resulting in unprecedented . scarcity. Daniel Griffin, an assistant professor in the Department of Geography, Environment and Society at the University of Minnesota, and Kevin Anchukaitis, an assistant scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, asked the question, 'How unusual is the ongoing California drought?' and collected new tree-ring samples from blue oak trees in southern and central California. 'We were genuinely surprised at the result,' says Griffin, a NOAA Climate & Global Change Fellow and former WHOI postdoctoral scholar. 'One thing is clear, drought is going to continue to happen. This is the kind of thing we get to see in the future.' The maps, developed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, combine GRACE data with other satellite observations. 'Integrating GRACE data with other satellite measurements provides a more holistic view of the impact of drought on water availability, including on groundwater resources, which are typically ignored in standard drought indices,' said Matt Rodell, chief of the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory at Goddard. The scientists cautioned that while the recent California storms have been helpful in replenishing water resources, they aren't nearly enough to end the multi-year drought. 'It takes years to get into a drought of this severity, and it will likely take many more big storms, and years, to crawl out of it,' said Famiglietti.","Current short-term drought  worse than any previous span of consecutive years of drought without reprieve .

"The Federal Communications Commission has received a series of complaints over a recent on-air outburst by New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, even though none of it was audible. And the NFL star isn't happy about it. The fiery 37-year-old unleashed several F-Bombs toward the end of the November 30 game against the Green Bay Packers, after it became apparent his team was set to lose. While it was obvious Brady was cursing the notorious four letter word, it was not picked up by microphones during the national broadcast by both CBS and NBC. However that did not stop at least three viewers filing official complaints with the FCC. At issue was the fact children watching the game could easily lip read and understand what Brady was screaming out. Scroll down for video . Angry: Tom Brady unleashed several F-Bombs during the November 30 game against the Green Bay Packers . Not happy: The outburst lead to at least three official complains lodged with the . Brady has since spoken about his in-game swearing,  explaining NFL players aren’t 'choirboys' 'My eight-year-old grandson was watching the game with me and even commented that he should not have said that,' a Pennsylvania grandparent complained to the FCC, according to The Smoking Gun. 'I understand the first time it happened that the camera man would not have expected that, but to keep the camera on Tom Brady as he kept yelling was uncalled for.' Another complainer added: 'They clearly knew he was saying it and so did my 10-year-old son … It was almost as if the announcers got away with it, because they didn't actually say it. 'Very unprofessional.' Third complainant, an Indianapolis parent, wrote that their 'six-year-old children know how to read lips even if there is no sound'. Brady has since addressed the situation, and said it was not his fault. He explained that NFL players aren't 'choirboys' and that upset viewers should 'blame CBS and NBC for putting it on TV'. Hitting back: Quarterback Tom Brady warms up before the NFL game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field on November 30, 2014 in Green Bay, Wisconsin . 'I wish I did have a better mouth out there at times, but there's nothing that quite expresses the way I feel like that word,' Brady said Monday on WEEI. 'It is, it is (a great word), especially in the heat of the moment … Blame CBS and NBC for putting it on TV. 'Don't blame me. We're not choirboys, I know that.

"It’s a special occasion – but our birthdays are not always that happy. The odds of dying on that day are higher than average, according to a study of millions of death records. The excesses of partying plus accidents while travelling to celebrations are risk factors, warned researchers. Accident: New research suggests the excesses of partying plus accidents while travelling to celebrations are risk factors on birthdays . Suicides triggered by the ‘birthday blues’ may also be to blame, said academics at Chicago University. Researcher Pablo Peña said the phenomenon could be due to people ‘deviating from their usual behaviour’ on their birthday.

"President Barack Obama's new . plan to spare 4.7 million illegal immigrants from the threat of deportation violates the U.S. Constitution, a . federal judge declared on Tuesday, handing down the first legal . ruling against the plan. Judge Arthur Schwab's ruling has no immediate impact, since the Obama administration says there was no reason for his Western District of Pennsylvania court to address the issue in the . case, which concerns the legal status of 42-year-old Honduran immigrant Elionardo . Juarez-Escobar. Schwab is the first judge to rule on the legality of the . plan Obama announced on Nov. 20. The executive action by the . Democratic president is opposed by Republicans and has already been legally challenged by two dozen U.S. states. 'President Obama's unilateral legislative action violates the separation of powers provided for in the United States Constitution as well as the Take Care Clause, and therefore is unconstitutional,' Judge Schwab wrote. UNCONSTITUTIONAL: Judge Arthur Schwab (left) ruled Tuesday that President Barack Obama's plan to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants is beyond his authority under the US Constitution . Anti-immigration-amnesty protesters have turned up outside Obama events in the weeks since his announcement, including these people on Dec. 9 in Nashville, Tennessee . The 'Take Care Clause' of the Constitution requires the president to faithfully execute laws passed by Congress. Schwab also ruled that the policy gives illegal immigrants a path 'to obtain substantive rights' that belong only to citizens and legal U.S. residents. U.S. senators from both sides of the aisle weighed in on Tuesday outside the Senate chamber. 'I obviously agree with the idea that the action he took was an unlawful and unconstitutional action,' South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune told MailOnline, noting that he had not yet read the ruling. 'I wish the president was a little bit more – I wish he had accepted the results of the election and decided that it was time, maybe, to go in a different direction,' Thune said. 'I don't know that he got the message.' 'Coming out right away with the immigration decision' after the Democrats' disastrous midterm shellacking 'wasn't helpful,' he said. Democratic Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois shot back: 'I think he's wrong' – referring to Judge Schwab, not Sen. Thune – before slipping onto the Senate floor and out of reach of reporters. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat told MailOnline that Schwab made 'an incorrect ruling,' and then abruptly ended his press availability. The administration has defended its policy by classifying it as an example of prosecutorial discretion,- a special case of a mundane and widely accepted authority granted to court officials who often must choose which cases to bring to trial and which to dismiss. But Schwab ruled that the president’s policy goes 'beyond' that, setting up a hard-and-fast framework for evaluating applications from millions of people – the opposite of a case-by-case determination. Obama's executive action 'goes beyond prosecutorial discretion,' he wrote. 'It is legislation.' TROUBLE: Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson toured a new family immigration detention center in Dilley, Texas, on Monday – a massive facility with a capacity of 2,400 people, opening after a summer surge of children crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally . Schwab says he ruled on the executive action issue because . he concluded that Juarez-Escobar could be eligible for relief . under the executive action, a situation that required him to dive into the minutiae of what Obama's plan does and doesn't do. Government lawyers told Schwab that Juarez-Escobar, who has . pleaded guilty to re-entering the country, was not eligible . because Obama's order does not affect criminal proceedings. Schwab was named to the federal bench in 2002 by President George W. Bush, a Republican. His other most noteworthy ruling came a year later, when he presided over a case involving 'Up In Smoke' actor Tommy Chong for conspiracy to distribute marijuana bongs. Schwab sentenced Chong to nine months in federal prison.

"Los Angeles prosecutors have declined to file any charges against Bill Cosby after a woman recently reported the comedian molested her around 1974. The rejection of a child sexual abuse charge by prosecutors on Tuesday comes roughly 10 days after the woman, Judy Huth, met with police detectives. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office rejected filing a misdemeanor charge of annoying or molesting a child under the age of 18 because the statute of limitations had passed. Scroll down for video . 'Molestation': Police have decided not to pursue claims by Judy Huth, left, against comedian Bill Cosby, right. Authorities had considered filing a charge of molesting a child under the age of 18, but decided not to because the alleged incident happened too long ago . No charges: Prosecutors declined to pursue claims against the comedian, pictured above in November, through the courts . Huth has claimed Cosby plied her with beer while the two played billiards, then led her to a bedroom inside the mansion and forced her to perform a sex act on him. A lawsuit claimed: 'psychological injuries and illnesses were caused by the sexual abuse.' Cosby's attorney said that Huth attempted to extort $250,000 from the comedian before she sued. The accusations prompted a horrified Hugh Hefner to issue a statement over the incident. Hefner, who counts Cosby as a close friend, said: 'the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening.' The Playboy mogul, who lives at the Beverly Hills mansion, added: 'I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved.' Other Playboy housemates have since claimed that Cosby's abuse was widespread. One woman, 24-year-old Chloe Goins, claims she was attacked in 2008 - and intends to go to police about it. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Goins said Cosby drugged her then stripped her naked. She allegedly woke up to find him sucking her toes and pleasuring himself. She said: 'I was butt naked lying on my back on a bed and didn't have any idea where I was... I came to and remember seeing this big man crouched over me. 'It was Bill Cosby and he was at my feet, kind of licking and kissing them and I think he bit my toe as that's what woke me up... He jumped up, pulled his pants back up quickly and left. Speaking out: Chloe Goins is the latest woman to speak of being drugged and attacked by Cosby. However her case is so recent that it is not covered by any statutes of limitation, which affects other allegations . 'He had seen that I was alert and bolted out of there, I was left in the room by myself.' 'I remember waking up and feeling moist all over, like he had been licking all over me... I felt embarrassed, it was a gross, icky feeling, I felt very violated and humiliated. 'I was scared, I was just 18 and he was an old man, I was not very sexually experienced and I didn't really know what had happened, it was violating.' Recently another housemate, P J Masten, who worked for Playboy in LA and Chicago, said she and 12 other Playboy workers were also raped, but have been too scared to come forward. 'Together': Lawyers for Huth have claimed this photogtraph shows Cosby and Huth together around the time of the attack . Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, has called allegations against the trailblazing African-American comedian 'discredited' and 'defamatory'. Singer and Cosby's publicist did not immediately response to requests seeking comment on Tuesday about the prosecutor's decision. Cosby's wife and one of his four daughters have defended him in public statements over the past two days. Evin Cosby, 38, said in a statement that Cosby 'is the father you thought you knew,' echoing the statement of her mother, Camille Cosby, who publicly defended her husband for the first time on Monday. The statements by Camille and Evin Cosby have drawn on the comedian's affable TV persona as the wholesome father Dr. Cliff Huxtable on the top-rated series 'The Cosby Show.' The comedian, who has largely remained silent, has had two television projects shelved and several standup performances canceled since the numerous allegations started last month. In 2006, Cosby settled a lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct. Another accuser, Tamara Green, has sued Cosby for defamation. Cosby's most high-profile accusers include models Janice Dickinson and Beverly Johnson. Dickinson alleges that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in 1982 while Johnson alleges Cosby drugged her in the mid-1980s.","Prosecutors in Los Angeles declined to file charges after new accusation .

"The parents of an aspiring weatherman who died from a gunshot wound to the head have slammed a police investigation into his death as 'a whitewash' after it ruled their son took his own life. Bill and Therese Engelhardt said they are now hiring a private investigator to look into the death of their son Timothy. The distraught couple said they are disgusted by the report which blames the 22-year-old for his own death. An 'extensive investigation' into the young man's death by police in Florida ruled that he had been ranting about suicide at a friend's home before grabbing the barrel of a loaded gun and pointing it at his head. Last picture: Timothy Englehardt (left) shared the picture with friends of him at a barbecue with his friend and room mate Cody Moore (right) on the day he died. Moore said the 22-yeat-old honor student had everything to live for. This is the last picture of him alive . Doubts: His parents, William and Therese, say he had everything to live for and wouldn't have taken his life . Timothy was shot in the head with the trigger apparently pulled by 26-year-old Jacob Eldred who was holding the gun. 'The police report is a load of bulls***. It is a whitewash and full of lies,'said Bill Engelhardt. 'My son did not take his own life. We wanted justice for Tim and we have not got this. 'We are hiring a private investigator to get to the bottom of this and find out the truth.' Timothy, who was studying meteorology at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach,Florida, died on September 13th. He was due to graduate next year and had already completed a successful internship at a local TV station in Boston and lined up a job on his graduation. On the day he died Englehardt had been hosting a BBQ with his roommate Cody Moore. Moore told Mail Online his friend had 'everything to live for' and had not been depressed. He supplied the last ever photo of Engelhardt taken at the BBQ with the pair smiling as they cooked for friends at their rented home in Daytona Beach. Tragic: Student Timothy Englehardt suffered a single gunshot to the head, dying as a result. He was studying to become a meteorologist at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Floriday . Scene of tragedy: The screened in porch where Timothy Englehardt died. Four other people were in the house at the time. Less than two hours later the aspiring weatherman was dead from a single gunshot wound to the head. He had gone to a friend's house in nearby Holly Hill to feed their dogs. According to the four people inside the home Englehardt started expressing suicidal thoughts after making a phone call. The police report said he had excused himself to make the call and when he returned was in an 'agitated mood'. Moments later he grabbed a gun that Eldred had been holding while the two men talked about Eldred's previous suicidal thoughts . The handgun's magazine had been removed but there was still a bullet in the chamber. The report makes clear that Timothy grabbed the gun and pulled it towards his head. It is thought Eldred's finger was on the trigger when the gun went off. However, the report clearly contradicts the earlier statement made by Stephanie Lauber who witnessed the killing. When police responded to an emergency call, she told the arriving officer she saw Englehardt take the gun and pull the trigger. Tauber said:'She advised that the victim, identified by her as Tim, also observed the magazine being removed from the weapon. 'She advised that she saw the victim take the weapon, place it to his head and pull the trigger. She advised that the victim then collapsed to the floor. 'She then began saying that she believed the shooting was actually an accident as the weapon was supposed to be unloaded.' The police report makes no mention of Engelhardt pulling the trigger. Bill Engelhardt said the report compiled by Holly Hill Police chief Steve Aldrich was 'full of lies'. He takes exception to the claim by witnesses that his son had become agitated after calling home. 'Mr Aldridge told me that the witnesses said Tim went out to make a phone call to his mother and then came back in an agitated state. That is just a lie. 'We had not spoken to Tim for several hours. There was no call to us before he died. The phone records will prove that. Also in the house: Stephanie Lauber, 22, a classmate of Englehardt, made the 911 call to say he had shot himself. A voice int he background can be heard apparently saying: 'I did it.' Lauber then tells that person: 'No, you didn't. Relax. You didn't kill him.' On the rise: Englehardt, pictured right, had completed an internship with WCVB in Boston over the summer . 'The police have just taken the word of those in the house and they have lied.They have not looked into anything about Tim otherwise they would know that he was not suicidal. 'We are beside ourselves. This is just sickening. The others in the house had lied to cover themselves.' The four people in the house were named as Lauber, Eldred, Charles Eichler, and Rachel Schlosberg. Police initially become suspicious about the death due to a call to the 911 dispatcher when a male voice could be heard in the background saying: 'I did it'. Lauber,who made the 911 call, replied: 'No, you didn't. You did not kill him.' Lauber refused to talk with Mail Online when contacted at the civil engineering office where she worked in Daytona Beach. Another puzzling aspect for police was why the why the gun was found in another room away from his body . The police investigation clears that aspect up by revealing Eldred was holding the gun when it went off and said he placed it on a coffee table. Investigated: Holly Hill Police Chief Steven Aldrich, whose force have now completed their investigation. It has been heavily criticized by the dead man's parents . Happy: Englehardt with an unnamed friend was said to be enjoying himself at university and had booked tickets home for Thanksgiving . The Engelhardts said they had hoped police in Holly Hill would have carried out a more thorough investigation. 'There is so many parts of the report that are wrong,' said Bill, from Haverhill, Massachusetts. 'We believe there has been a cover up. People are lying and those in the house have come up with a credible story that the police believe. 'Holly Hill Police chief Steve Aldrich told me on the phone today that my son was talking to my wife just before he died. My wife would know if she talked to her own son. The phone records will be the proof as he did not call. They have just taken the words of those in the house, and they are lying. 'We have waited three months for this report and it's a whitewash. Tim had just been told by his grandmother that she would pay for his flight ticket home. He was happy. Why would he take his own life. We want answers.' The Holly Hill Police Department has completed its extensive investigation into the death of Timothy Englehardt on the night of September 13, 2014, at  - Clifton Avenue, Holly Hill. After a thorough investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding Mr. Englehardt's death, a criminal complaint affidavit will be forwarded to the State Attorney's office charging Jacob Eldred, 26 yoa, with the Improper Exhibition of Dangerous Weapons or Firearm (1st degree Misdemeanor). A copy of the criminal complaint affidavit will be released when it is filed with the State Attorney's Office for their review. Our investigation into the death of Timothy Englehardt revealed that Timothy had gone to his friends' home to care for Jacob Eldred's pet prior to Mr Eldred's return from a daytrip in the Gainesville area. Upon returning home, Jacob Eldred and his friends, (Stephanie Lauber, Charles Eichler, and Rachel Schlosberg) found Timothy still at the house. Once in the home, the group began to talk and drink sociably. Witness statements indicated that after a short period of time, Timothy Englehardt excused himself to the rear yard during a phone conversation. While Timothy Englehardt was in the rear yard speaking on the phone, Charles Eichler and Rachel Schlosberg excused themselves to Charles Eichler's bedroom, in the rear of the residence, for a more private conversation. Jacob Eldred and Stephanie Lauber were in the front Florida Room when Timothy returned from his phone conversation in an agitated mood. According to witness statements, Timothy began ranting about his perceived personal problems and making suicidal statements. Growing weary of Timothy's ranting about suicide, Jacob Eldred removed the magazine from his .45 caliber firearm that he normally carried and confronted Timothy about his suicidal statements. While standing face to face with Timothy, Jacob had his handgun out pointing it at himself telling Timothy about his own past thoughts of harming himself and the fact that it was never the right thing to do. According to witness statements, Timothy then grabbed the barrel of the gun and pulled it toward his head. The firearm immediately discharged striking Timothy Englehardt in the head. While still holding the firearm, Jacob Eldred immediately placed the firearm on a nearby coffee table and exited the room with Stephanie Lauber. Stephanie Lauber immediately placed a phone call to 911 to report the shooting and to summon emergency assistance. Any further informational releases related to this case will be at the discretion of the State Attorney's Office once they have reviewed the case.","Timothy Englehardt died from a gunshot wound as he hung out with friends in Florida on September 13 .

"Three elementary teachers in a New Jersey school district have been caught having a shocking conversation about some of their special needs students, referring to them as 'morons' and 'short bus kids' - and are now set to be fired as a result. The teachers - Tyler Van Pelt, Maria Weber and Maryellen Lechelt - allegedly engaged in an inappropriate online discussion on October 23 while training in a new technology to be implemented in their school district of Edison, however were unaware that the chat room could be accessed by others in the program. Another teacher in the room suspected the trio were making fun of her after hearing them laughing and soon stumbled upon a transcript of their vulgar chat, which she then sent to her principal. The three were suspended with pay - as per procedure - and are accused of unbecoming conduct, insubordination for misuse of school technology, failure to pay attention to the training and violating the district's sexual harassment and affirmative action policies, among other charges, NBC New York reported. Board: A New Jersey school district have agreed to bring tenure charges against three teachers who were caught disparaging some of their disabled students and some other teachers . Scene: Two of three teachers work at Lincoln Elementary School in New Jersey . The teachers were learning how to use Chromebook laptops when the incident occurred. According to NJ.com, Van Pelt invited Weber and Lechelt into what he called a 'personal wiseass (sic) backchannel discussion'. 'i like the group name ''morons'',' Lechelt allegedly responded. 'they take the tart cart home.' Van Pelt then wrote back: 'short bus kids.' Van Pelt also described a group of his students as 'I hate you don't waste my time'. Lechelt, following suit, described some of her own charges as 'jesus christ, why the f--- did they place you with me?'. Weber did not contribute to that conversation, however the chat moved from students to fellow teachers. Weber is accused of speaking out of line by questioning the sexual hygiene habits of the woman running the training program. 'She looks like a poor man's Denise Richards,' Van Pelt allegedly wrote of the woman. 'poor man's anything is as good as its gonna get in edison,' Lechelt wrote back. Van Pelt allegedly then said of the woman: 'i'd like to invite her to a private backchannel discussion... all night long.' During the conversation, Van Pelt suggested he was leaving the room to masturbate, NJ.com reported. Outraged: Parents, such as Andrea Siragusa (pictured) have come forward, calling for the teachers to be fired . He was subsequently accused of Masturbating In or Around Board Property, but denies this happened. Van Pelt and Lechelt are teachers at Lincoln Elementary. Van Pelt runs a local education blog, while Lechelt won the 2012 Outstanding Classroom Teacher of the Year award from the Edison Chamber of Commerce. Weber is a teacher at James Monroe Elementary. The Edison Board of Education met on Monday to discuss the matter. They moved to terminate the teachers, but have put them on paid leave for 120 days in the interim. Their case will be decided by an arbitrator, who may also decide to keep them on or reduce their pay. Parents of the students who attend classes by the teachers involved are said to be furious. 'If you choose to be a teacher, it's a public work. You're dealing with kids. If you don't have it in you, I feel like the decent thing for you to do is to resign,' parent Andrea Siragusa told NBC New York.","Tyler Van Pelt, Maria Weber and Maryellen Lechelt have been suspended by the Edison School District in New Jersey .

"Mark Oberholtzer isn't an Islamic fighter in Syria. He's never been to Syria. And the plumber from Texas City, Texas, says he certainly would never willingly aid fundamentalist rebels. So it's hard for him to understand how his Ford F-250 pickup truck - including his logo for Mark-1 Plumbing and his phone number - wound up being in a photo posted on Twitter by the extremist Ansar al-Deen Front from the front lines of the war in Syria. Mr Oberholtzer says he's been getting hundreds of phone calls and faxes since the Ansar al-Deen Front tweeted a picture of what appeared to be his old truck with an anti-aircraft gun in the back, according to the Galveston County Daily News. However, it remains to be seen if the photo is entirely authentic, with a new video surfacing which suggests the photo could have been digitally altered. Scroll down for video . This truck, once owned by Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City, Texas, is seen here in an Islamist propaganda photo. It's unclear if it has gone all the way to Syria or whether the photo has been digitally altered . This photo, taken from a propaganda video, shows a near identical scene featuring a different truck, raising questions as to the authenticity of the photo featuring Mr Oberholtzer's truck . The Islamist forces fighting across the region are known for their advanced and technical digital propaganda campaigns. The video, featuring a different vehicle firing from exactly the same position, raises the possibility Mr Oberholtzer's vehicle may have been photoshopped into a video frame. Superimposing a better vehicle and gun into a still frame from the original video would be significantly easier than trying to alter the video itself. This could be why the video features an older model car and weapon, but the photo features Mr Oberholtzer's later-model Toyota. Despite this, people have now been making hateful phone calls to Mr Oberholtzer's company in the mistaken belief he is supporting the fundamentalists. 'A few of the people are really ugly,' he told the newspaper. Some threatened his life. Mr Oberholtzer says he has hired a lawyer and wants to make Twitter remove the posting, CBS News reports. He says he sold the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. In the past when he sold his work trucks, he always removed the logo first. The last time he got rid of a vehicle he didn't. Mark Oberholtzer says he has no idea how Islamists in Syria could have got hold of his truck . Mr Oberholtzer, who has worked as a plumber for the past 32-years, assumed AutoNation would remove the decal before selling the truck. Apparently it didn't. It's still unknown how the truck could have made its way into the possession of Islamist fighters in Syria. A spokesman for AutoNation told KHOU 11 News that the truck went to auction, and probably different owners over and over, before it may have ended up in the hands of Islamic terrorists. Oberholtzer wants the death threats and the phone to stop ringing. 'We have a secretary here, she's scared to death. We all have families. We don't want no problems,' said Oberholtzer. CBS News reports that the band of Ansar al-Deen seen in the photo mostly hail from Chechnya in Russia. While most fighters are Islamic extremists, the group has not reportedly allied itself with ISIS in Syria. ISIS: The terror group has expanded how and why it recruits new members and is specifically targeting sympathizers abroad . And while it is not known how fighters with ISIS could have come to own a Texan plumber's truck, the terror group is trying to expand how it recruits fighters to its ranks. The extremist organization also has been targeting its sophisticated propaganda to entice potential wives and professionals such as doctors, accountants and engineers in its efforts to build a new society. Among those it has lured were three teenage girls from Colorado, who set out for Syria this fall after swapping Twitter messages about marriage and religion with IS recruiters, and a young woman who sought to fight there - or failing that, to use her nursing skills. It's a diverse pool of recruits whose motives perplex Western governments seeking to combat the flow. The group 'is issuing a bit of a siren song through social media, trying to attract people to their so-called caliphate,' FBI Director James Comey told reporters. 'And among the people they're trying to attract are young women to be brides for these jihadis.' The group conscripts children for battle, recruits Westerners for acts of jihad and releases videotapes of beheadings. But it also uses propaganda with a humanitarian appeal, such as photos of bombed-out Syrian villages coupled with pleas for help. Video images of smiling children being given treats and enjoying stuffed animals paint a family-friendly portrait that suggests roles within the proto-state for wives and mothers. Justice Department officials say people aiding the Islamic State understand what they're getting into and risk prosecution, whether or not they venture to Syria and even if they don't plan to take up arms themselves. Prosecutors have criminally charged more than 15 people in connection with supporting Islamic militant groups. Advance: Militant Islamist fighters wave flags as they take part in a military parade along the streets of Syria's northern Raqqa province in June . A Rochester, New York, food store owner stands accused of trying to arrange for others to travel to Syria and of plotting to kill members of the U.S. military. An Illinois man, allegedly determined to join militants, left behind a letter saying he was disgusted by Western society. And prosecutors say a North Carolina man asked Allah online for martyrdom. Most charges are brought under a statute that makes it illegal to provide 'material support' - including money, training or a false identity - to a designated terrorist group. Defense lawyers argued the law is overly broad and ensnares the misguided as often as it sweeps up the dangerous. Courts, however, have accepted an expansive interpretation of the law. 'We need to make clear that if you want to go over there and join a terrorist group, you're likely to end up instead in jail,' Carlin said. Justice Department officials say they're also trying strategies other than prosecution, including trying to identify potential recruits before they go. FBI agents in Colorado met repeatedly with Shannon Conley, a 19-year-old nurse's aide who had converted to Islam, hoping to dissuade her from traveling to Syria to marry a militant suitor she met online. Agents suggested she try humanitarian work instead of jihad, but she told them that if she couldn't fight, she would use her skills as a nurse's aide to help militant fighters, according to court documents. Conley pleaded guilty in September and faces sentencing next month. Her lawyer, Robert Pepin, has said she was 'led terribly astray' while pursuing her religion and was 'saved' by her arrest. Perhaps no case better shows the penetration of the recruitment campaign than that of the three Colorado girls, all from East African immigrant families, who were radicalized online and headed for Syria in October. The self-styled 'caliphate' declared by the Islamic State group bridging Iraq and Syria is starting to show signs of strain . A review of the girls' social media use, which included thousands of Twitter messages and postings on other sites, by the SITE Intelligence Group shows they were in contact with online jihadists from around the world and were deeply interested in marriage and the role of women. As recruiters interacted with the girls, their typical teenage banter about friends and school became replaced with discussions of religion, paradise and death, the review showed. Six months before they went overseas, one girl wrote that she wanted to get married as soon as possible and her friends wished her well, telling her they hoped she got an 'amazing husband because you do not deserve anything else!' One female recruiter told prospects to expect to marry quickly and expect to live a domestic life, as it is 'completely impossible for women to participate in battle,' according to SITE. Women are expected to marry the fighters and bear their children, she explained. Another recruiter told a 16-year-old girl who inquired about joining that 'everyone is welcome,' according to the report. U.S. officials say even comparatively benign motives for supporting the Islamic State are troubling. 'I'm not sure we've seen someone who's gone over there who's not attracted to the jihadi cause,' Carlin said.","Mark Oberholtzer, of Texas City, Texas, sold his truck to a dealership three years ago .

"It was revealed that a virus forced Tyson Fury to miss his last three weeks of training, but it was the fans who caught a bad cold on a fog-shrouded Saturday night in London’s Docklands. Fury climbed from his sickbed in time to reduce Dereck Chisora’s face to something out of pulp fiction with his telescopic jab and thereby move into line to challenge dominant world heavyweight Wladimir Klitschko next year. When, and if, that happens it will be a sight worth seeing. So hopefully it will take place before thousands of those watching have left. VIDEO Scroll down for Peter Fury: Tyson have to be at death's door to pull out of a fight . Tyson Fury spars with his trainer Peter Fury in the lead up to his fight with Dereck Chisora . Tyson's uncle Peter (left) revealed that the heavyweight fighter was suffering with a virus up until last week . Tyson Fury dominated Dereck Chisora for 10 rounds before his opponent was pulled out by his corner . Fury lands an uppercut on his way to a decisive victory over Chisora . ExCel sounds like a prescription drug but there was no easy remedy for the public as a rousing evening of boxing in that arena yawned on into the early hours of Sunday. Those without cars faced a choice: make a dash for the last train back to town before the main event even started, or stay in their seats to get their money’s worth before emerging into the dank and the dark to join long queues for infrequent night buses or wander deserted byways hoping to hitch a lift. They could walk for hours to the nearest quarter of the City where taxis might still have been operating. Grim choices for ticket buyers. Especially those in stiletto heels and micro dresses. These over- running shows are becoming as epidemic as flu in winter. Last weekend in Liverpool, Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly lumbered on until after midnight. Fury and Chisora were supposed to be in the ring by 11pm but did not touch gloves until 12.40am. Chisora stumbles forward as he struggled to get any purchase on his punches while Fury throws out his jab . Those in the sell-out crowd of 15,700 who were anxious to catch that last train just about made it by scarpering the moment the judges of the preceding bout awarded their split decision to Billy Joe Saunders over Chris Eubank Jnr. At least they had seen the fight of the night. But no-one is more conscious than promoter Frank Warren that they will think twice about going next time if tarrying until the climax means you cannot get home before dawn. Having lived up to his promise of a good night’s sport, he departed vowing to ‘put a curfew on the finishing time in future’. Some will be saying that those who missed Fury spearing Chisora with his switch-hitting jabs until he resembled a gargoyle were the lucky ones. Peter Fury, the gypsy giant’s trainer and uncle, let us in on the secret of his nephew’s pre-fight ailment, saying: ‘Tyson was weakened but would not pull out.’ From the first bell, Fury was on top with Chisora failing to land a decisive blow over the 10 rounds . That reinforced their decision to minimise risk, especially with a prize as rich as a mandatory position as Klitschko’s challenger at stake. Uncle Peter praised his young nephew for ‘having the maturity to be patient against a man who will always be dangerous if you give him the chance’. Some of those still in attendance grew restless as Fury used his 6ft 9in height to lean back out of Chisora’s range and his long reach to gradually disfigure his opponent’s features. It was not a performance to cause Klitschko any loss of sleep as the rest of us trudged home but it forced the stoppage of a hard man who was in better shape than when he took Fury the distance in their first fight three years ago. With Chisora’s eyes swollen to near-closing point his corner convened a medical consultation at the end of the 10th. Warren instructed them to pull him out. Fury, in a southpaw stance, shows his height and reach advantage which allowed him to dominate all night . Chisora has his eye checked after being forced to take some heavy punishment from Fury's jab . Chisora had not won a round and Warren said: ‘No boxer likes to be retired. Least of all in a fight this important. Dereck was not happy. But by then he had no chance of winning and there was no point him taking further punishment.’ The boos had been growing louder but Peter Fury said: ‘Some people with a lot of booze only want a slug-fest. We are interested in bringing the world heavyweight title back to Britain and Tyson will do that. He has phenomenal talent and until now we’ve only been scratching the surface. He’ll be ready for Klitschko next year.’ Warren said: ‘That will be a huge stadium fight and we’ll do all we can to get it over here.’ That will have to wait until Klitschko is given his chance to add the only world title missing from his collection, the WBC belt soon to be contested by Deontay Wilder and Bermane Stiverne. The fight is waved off after Chisora's trainer Don Charles told his man that he wanted him to go out on his feet . Fury is congratulated by his wife Paris after conserving his unbeaten record with victory over Chisora . Fury locks lips with Paris and has barely a scratch on his face after the one-sided showing in London . Klitschko is expected to meet the winner in the spring, while Fury will keep busy against a top-15 opponent on Warren’s February 28 promotion at London’s O2 Arena. Assuming there are no nasty surprises, the Ukrainian and the Mancunian should meet next August or September. Saunders opened the door to his own world middleweight title shot by surviving a gladiator comeback by the powerful son of a fabled father. Chris Eubank Snr stood erect and absorbed while Junior failed to win any of the first six rounds as the experience and technical skills of Saunders taught him a lesson. But the lad is a quick learner. He turned it into a rough-house in the second half of the fight, clawed back some of the deficit and forced Saunders to dig deep to survive a storming finish. Fury claimed the European and vacant British belt to set up a challenge against Wladimir Klitschko (above) It ended with Eubank still 117-112 behind on my card but the judges called a close split decision. This came a fight or two too early for Eubank but stars can be born in thrilling defeats and by the time this rivalry blossoms into a rematch, the outcome could be different. But that is on hold while Saunders chases his dream. Fury has long hoped to become the first member of the travelling community to win a world title but Saunders may beat him to it. Billy Joe is now the mandatory challenger for the winner of next month’s fight for the WBO middleweight belt between Matt Korobov and Ireland’s Andy Lee. Saunders should get his shot in March or April and again Warren will strive to bring his man home advantage — but before the witching hour, if you please. By the time I had finished working and negotiated a plague of roadworks, I was opening my front door in London at a quarter-to-four in the morning. But then I am paid to do this, not forking out hard-earned cash for the very dubious privilege of being stranded in the dead of night.","Tyson Fury coasted to a 10th-round stoppage win over Dereck Chisora .

From algae to zebrafish, life under the microscope can be beautiful, surprising and mysterious. This week, amazing glimpses of the unseen universe earned top prizes in the 2014 Olympus BioScapes Digital Imaging Competition®, the world's foremost forum for showcasing microscope images of life science . subjects. First Prize went to an extraordinary movie of a fruit fly developing, captured by a team including William Lemon, Fernando Amat and Philipp Keller of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Virginia. In the fascinating video, a trembling ball of cells turns into a fully developed fly larva that actually starts to crawl off screen by the movie's end. It was selected from among nearly 2500 entries to earn $5,000 worth of Olympus equipment. 'For 11 years, Olympus has sponsored this competition to shed light on the importance of research and draw attention to the amazing intersection of science and art,' said Hidenao Tsuchiya, Chairman of Olympus Scientific Solutions Americas, part of Olympus Corporation. 'Olympus BioScapes movies and images have spurred public interest in and support of microscopy, drawn attention to the vital work that goes on in laboratories worldwide, and inspired young people to seek careers in science.' The First Prize movie is a good example, say organisers of the contest. High-speed videos like this allow researchers, almost for the first time, to follow the fate of individual embryonic cells from shortly after fertilization to the time the fly larva hatches; the cells divide, migrate, diversify and eventually become the varied organs and systems of the fly. Understanding exactly how an animal develops and how different cells develop separate functions can lead to a better understanding of life processes, and ultimately may contribute to disease research.

"The Russian economy is set to plunge deeper into the abyss, after a  desperate interest rate hike failed to halt a slide in the value of the battered Russian rouble. As a result of plummeting oil prices and Western sanctions over Ukraine, the entire Russian stock market is now worth less than the market value of Microsoft. However, the Russians are concerned with a more pressing crisis: they are running out of buckwheat. Buckwheat and bling: A young Russian lady displays her wealth: furs,  cash, jewels and buckwheat . Not my buckwheat! Two men in military uniforms pretend to cry over spilled buckwheat in the snow . My country, my buckwheat: This young pouting princess holds her buckwheat close to her heart . Buckwheat has been a Russian staple for centuries, and is used for everything from porridge to casseroles and baking. The grain is particularly associated with the Soviet era, and buckwheat, or 'grechka' in Russian, is eaten across the country's timezones and social classes. Following a poor annual harvest in Siberia, Russians are now bulk-buying buckwheat, and taking selfies proudly displaying their bounties. One young fur-clad lady has snapped herself flashing a wad of cash and a bowl of buckwheat, while another picture show two men in military uniforms pretending to cry over spilled buckwheat in the snow. Others show young Russian women clutching buckwheat to their hearts, or filling a trolley to the brim with bags of the grain . But while the population worry about missing out on their favourite porridge, President Vladimir Putin has more pressing matters to attend to. Russian priorities: A poor buckwheat harvest has seen Russians across the country bulk-buy the grain amid the national economic crisis . Nation's favourite: Buckwheat is a Russian staple and is used for everything from porridge to baking bread . Clearing out: One lucky young lady has managed to get her hands on one remaining brand of buckwheat on an otherwise completely cleared out buckwheat shelf in a supermarket . Buckwheat before boyfriends: This ecstatic young lady got up-close-and-personal with her buckwheat bags . In the early hours of this morning, Putin's central bank ramped up interest rates from 10.5 per cent to 17 per cent in a desperate bid to save the battered rouble. The currency has lost around half its value this year due to falling oil prices and the impact of Western sanctions on Moscow over the annexation of Crimea and 'destabilisation' of eastern Ukraine. While there are few overt signs of panic, the 1am move from Putin's central bank showed the level of concern in the Kremlin. The rouble initially rallied but slumped again as the move produced mixed results. Despite its name, buckwheat is not releated to wheat and is not a grain, but a fruit seed related to rhubarb. It is recommended as a substitute to those suffering from gluten intolerance and has a very low GI. It is considered a staple food in Russia and some parts of eastern Europe. It can be eaten as a rice-replacement, but is commonly used to make porridge. Ground down, buckwheat flour is used to make blinis and bread and to thicken sauces and casseroles. Russia was the world's number one buckwheat producer until it was overtaken by China. News agency RBK forlornly compared the entire Russian stock market capitalisation at the close on 14 December at $384.9 billion with the Microsoft Corporation at $386.6 billion and Apple at $643.9 billion. It warned of a risk of falling below Google - at $352.7 billion . Russians have seen a marked rise in prices of essentials in recent weeks as inflation bites, and today there was a warning of another 15 per cent rise in early 2015. The Bank of Russia said today's hike was 'aimed at limiting substantially increased rouble depreciation risks and inflation risks'. And as if the buckwheat shortage was not enough, Russians may find an increase in prices across the foodgroups. 'Foodstuffs will be getting more expensive simultaneously in the luxury and economy chains,' warned Andrei Karpov, the executive director of the AKORT association of retail traders. 'The price rises will embrace imported foods and Russian produce in an equal measure.' There is now 'a growing sense that the currency crisis is spiralling out of control' and increasing speculation that government could undertake stricter measures like capital controls, warned Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at London-based Capital Economics. 'In the absence of an improvement in relations with the West and a lifting of the economic and financial sanctions on Russia, the appeal of capital controls and external debt default will grow.'","Buckwheat is a Russian staple commonly associated with Soviet .

"Having plied his trade among Europe's elite for over a decade it's fair to say Xabi Alonso knows a player. Winning the Champions League twice, the former Liverpool midfielder can identify exactly what it takes to formulate a team to lift the continent's biggest prize. Now at Bayern Munich, the Spaniard has picked his greatest ever Champions League XI - starting with Manuel Neuer and ending with Lionel Messi. Here is Alonso's team and why he picked them in his own words. And he's played with or against them all. Scroll down to view the Champions League XI in pitch form . Xabi Alonso (celebrating in the Istanbul final in 2005) has picked his Champions League dream team . Alonso has clinched the biggest club competition in world football on two occasions in his career . The central midfielder now plies his trade with Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich . Alonso laughs with Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher earlier this season over in Germany . Manuel Neuer . Teams played for: Schalke, Bayern Munich . Wins: 2013 . I have played with some fantastic goalkeepers, but he is the best. It isn’t just the ability he has to make saves, but how good he is outfield and the fantastic composure that he always shows on the ball. Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is between the sticks in Alonso's dream XI . Philipp Lahm . Team played for: Bayern Munich . Wins: 2013 . Such a great player for Bayern, his leadership and qualities have been missed while he has been injured. Hopefully we will have him back for some important matches before the end of the season. He is comfortably one of the top five defenders of the last 10 years. Germany's World Cup-winning captain Philipp Lahm is stationed at right back for Alonso . Sergio Ramos . Teams played for: Real Madrid . Wins: 2014 . When Sergio is mentally on the top of his game, then I think he is the best there is. He is a leader, he gives everything, and as a player in midfield he is the sort of defender that makes you feel very comfortable being behind you. Sergio Ramos scored for Real Madrid during the Champions League final win against Atletico last season . Carles Puyol . Teams played for: Barcelona . Wins: 2006, 2009, 2011 . So important for Spain’s success at the Euros in 2008 and then was even better when we won the World Cup in 2010. So dependable at the back, and then scored that winning goal against Germany in the semi-final. David Alaba . Teams played for: Bayern Munich . Wins: 2013 . One of those players who I think does not get the recognition outside of Germany and Austria he deserves. Maybe the most complete full back in the world who can attack and defend brilliantly. When I joined Bayern it was him and Neuer who impressed me the most. Carles Puyol (lifting the trophy in 2009) is at centre-back with David Alaba (right) out on the left . Zinedine Zidane . Teams played for: Juventus, Real Madrid . Wins: 2002 . I played against him when he was at Madrid and also against France, then of course he was part of the staff when I was playing for Real. At his peak he was on a different level to anybody, made the most difficult of things look easy. Zinedine Zidane scored an incredible goal for Real Madrid against Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 final . Paul Scholes . Teams played for: Manchester United . Wins: 1999, 2008 . In Spain you would not believe how well respected he is by professionals and journalists. Maybe because he was quiet off the field he never got the right praise in England because he likes to keep a low profile. Technically he could have played in any league in the world. Manchester United's Paul Scholes watches as his effort flies into the Barcelona net at Old Trafford . Xavi . Teams played for: Barcelona . Wins: 2006, 2009, 2011 . Such an intelligent player, and proof that you don’t have to cover 100 miles to be effective. So much of Spain’s success was because we played with so many midfield players, and Xavi was at the centre of everything. Barcelona captain Xavi has been the heartbeat of the Catalans' side for years . Steven Gerrard . Teams played for: Liverpool . Wins: 2005 . He is a great friend and has been a big influence on my life. As a player it is about so much more than his obvious ability. It’s his behaviour, his leadership, the values that he stands for and what he represents as a captain. Steven Gerrard (centre) celebrates with Alonso (second right) after Liverpool beat AC Milan in the 2005 final . Cristiano Ronaldo . Teams played for: Manchester United, Real Madrid . Wins: 2008, 2014 . If you looked at his goalscoring record for Real Madrid and you hadn’t witnessed it yourself, then you just wouldn’t believe that it is possible. I have been privileged to play with some amazing players, but he is the best. Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo wheels away after scoring against Atletico in Lisbon last year . Lionel Messi . Teams played for: Barcelona . Wins: 2006, 2009, 2011 . To have two players like Messi and Ronaldo in the same era is pretty rare. The individual brilliance that they are capable of sets them apart. It is no surprise that they have won so many Ballon d'Ors between them. Lionel Messi's goalscoring record since breaking through at Barcelona has been phenomenal .","Xabi Alonso has picked his Champions League dream team .

"A manager at a ‘busy NYC restaurant’ claims that customers constantly using their cell phones are to blame for a dramatic increase in the amount of time it takes to be served in restaurants nowadays. In an anonymous post on the Craigslist 'rants & raves' board, the restaurateur claims to have reviewed surveillance videos from 2004 and 2014 and found a staggering difference in the average time it takes to service a customer. Following their research, the poster found that the average time that a customer spent in the restaurant from start to finish in 2004 was 1 hour and 5 minutes, while in 2014 the average time was 1 hour and 55 minutes. An anonymous restaurant manager claims to have reviewed surveillance videos from 2004 and 2014 and found a staggering difference in the average time it takes to serve a customer because they spend so long on their cell phones . The restaurant decided to compare the footage in a bid to discover why service is significantly slower compared with ten years ago despite adding staff and cutting back on menu items. After comparing the videos, they found that cell phones have become a large distraction for customers which are preventing them from ordering as efficiently as they once did. Nowadays customers are too per-occupied with taking photos upon entering, telling the waiters they are having problems connecting to the WiFi, taking photos of their food once it’s delivered to them and bumping into other customers and waiters as they enter and exit the restaurant as a result of texting while walking. Restaurant customers nowadays are too preoccupied with taking photos and telling waiters they are having problems connecting to the WiFi . The poster, who lists their age as 28 and location as Midtown East Manhattan, offers few clues to the name of the restaurant but describes it as popular with both locals and tourists alike. ‘We are grateful for everyone who comes into our restaurant, after all there are so many choices out there. But can you please be a bit more considerate?,’ the poster begs. Read the full post here... We are a popular restaurant for both locals and tourists alike. Having been in business for many years we noticed that although the number of customer’s we serve on a daily basis is almost the same today as it was 10 years ago, the service just seems super slow even thou we added lot’s more staff and cut back on the menu items. One of the most common complaints on review sites against us and many restaurants in the area is that the service was slow and or they needed to wait a bit long for a table. We decided to hire a firm to help us solve this mystery, and naturally the first thing they blamed it on was that the employees need more training and that maybe the kitchen staff is just not up to the task of serving that many customers. Like most restaurants in NYC we have a surveillance system, and unlike today where it’s a digital system, 10 years ago we still used special high capacity tapes to record all activity. At any given time we had 4 special Sony systems recording multiple cameras. We would store the footage for 90 days just in case we need it for something. The restaurant decided to compare the footage in a bid to discover why service is significantly slower compared with ten years ago despite adding staff and cutting back on menu items . The firm we hired suggested we locate some of the older tapes and analyze how the staff behaved 10 years ago versus how they behave now. We went down to our storage room but we couldn’t find any tapes at all. We did find the recording devices, and luckily for us, each device has 1 tape in it that we simply never removed when we upgraded to the new digital system. The date stamp on the old footage was Thursday July 1 2004, the restaurant was real busy that day. We loaded up the footage on a large size monitor, and next to it on a separate monitor loaded up the footage of Thursday July 3 2014, the amount of customers where only a bit more than 10 years prior. I will quickly outline the findings. We carefully looked at over 45 transactions in order to determine the data below: . 2004: . Customers walk in. They gets seated and are given menus, out of 45 customers 3 request to be seated elsewhere. Customers on average spend 8 minutes before closing the menu to show they are ready to order. Waiters shows up almost instantly takes the order. Food starts getting delivered within 6 minutes, obviously the more complex items take way longer. Out of 45 customers 2 sent items back that where too cold we assume (given they were not steak we assume they wanted the item heated up more).

Average time from start to finish: 1:05 . 2014: . Customers walk in. Customers get seated and is given menus, out of 45 customers 18 requested to be seated elsewhere. Before even opening the menu they take their phones out, some are taking photos while others are simply doing something else on their phone (sorry we have no clue what they are doing and do not monitor customer WIFI activity). 7 out of the 45 customers had waiters come over right away, they showed them something on their phone and spent an average of 5 minutes of the waiter’s time. Given this is recent footage, we asked the waiters about this and they explained those customers had a problem connecting to the WIFI and demanded the waiters try to help them. Finally the waiters are walking over to the table to see what the customers would like to order. The majority have not even opened the menu and ask the waiter to wait a bit. Customer opens the menu, places their hands holding their phones on top of it and continue doing whatever on their phone. Waiter returns to see if they are ready to order or have any questions. The customer asks for more time. Finally they are ready to order. Total average time from when the customer was seated until they placed their order 21 minutes.

This takes on average another 4 minutes as they must review and sometimes retake the photo. 9 out of 45 customers sent their food back to reheat. Obviously if they didn’t pause to do whatever on their phone the food wouldn’t have gotten cold. 27 out of 45 customers asked their waiter to take a group photo. 14 of those requested the waiter retake the photo as they were not pleased with the first photo. On average this entire process between the chit chatting and reviewing the photo taken added another 5 minutes and obviously caused the waiter not to be able to take care of other tables he/she was serving. Given in most cases the customers are constantly busy on their phones it took an average of 20 minutes more from when they were done eating until they requested a check. Furthermore once the check was delivered it took 15 minutes longer than 10 years ago for them to pay and leave. 8 out of 45 customers bumped into other customers or in one case a waiter (texting while walking) as they were either walking in or out of the Restaurant.

"The wife of Olympic ski champ Bode Miller is showing off her baby bump in a new photo. Morgan Beck, a professional volleyball player and model, shared a snap of her growing belly on Instagram as the two enjoy a tropical vacation. The pair confirmed just last week that Beck was pregnant, making this the third child for Miller and the first for Beck. Scroll down for video . Mom to be: Morgan Beck (above) showed of her baby bump just days after she and husband Bode Miler announced they were expecting . Showing: In a photo of the couple posted over Thanksgiving (above), Beck's little bump can be seen . A look back at a photo of the couple over Thanksgiving also shows Beck with a tiny baby bump. This after Beck implied that Sara McKenna, the mother to Miller's 22-month-old son, got pregnant by fishing one of the skier's condoms out of the trash and inseminating herself. 'Girls do crazy things for money... including taking condoms out of trash cans and locking themselves in a bathroom,' read the November 18 post on TheBump.com. After users became aware of her identity, the image and posts were promptly removed. McKenna and Miller have been involved in litigation over custody of their since his birth, with the case just now being settled, though details have not been made public. Even more strange is the fact that McKenna named the boy Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna, though Miller has named him Nathaniel. Miller, 37, chose that name to honor his brother who died of a seizure at the age of 29 in 2013. Drama: Last month, Beck accused Miller's ex Sara McKenna (left) of getting pregnat with their son by taking a condom out of the trash . Odd: While McKenna named their son Samuel, Miller (above) calls him Nathaniel . McKenna has also dismissed Beck's claims about how she got pregnant, saying; 'Sam was conceived the old fashioned while we were on vacation in Florida. This Morgan thing has been getting a little out of control and downright scary and I would like it to stop.' Miller and Beck, who met in 2012 just months after he began dating McKenna, were married in October 2012. Early in 2013 Beck, 27, suffered a miscarriage while pregnant with a child, just one month before McKenna gave birth. Miller's other child is daughter Neesyn, who he had with his ex Chanel Johnson and was born in 2008. Miller has named her Dacey.","Bode Miller, 37, and Morgan Beck, 27, confirmed last week that they are expecting their first child together .

"Former AC Milan and Real Madrid midfielder Kaka has been revealed as the highest earning MLS player, despite never having played for his club. The 32-year-old Brazilian, who signed for Orlando City in June and was immediately loaned to Sao Paulo, earns just over £4.4million a year, which works out at £84,000 per week. LA Galaxy forward Robbie Keane (£2.76m), meanwhile, earns more than Arsenal legend Thierry Henry (£2.67m) does at the New York Red Bulls. Former Totteham and Fulham midfielder Clint Dempsey is the highest earning American in the MLS . The MLS's highest earner, Kaka signed for Orlando City in June but immediately joined Sao Paulo on loan . Jermain Defoe secured a lucrative move to Toronto earlier this year, but a return is not out of the question . Kaka  £4.4m  (£84,000 per week) Clint Dempsey  £4.1m (£78,000 per week) Michael Bradley  £3.9m (£75,000 per week) Jermain Defoe  £3.8m (£73,000 per week) Landon Donovan  £2.8m (£53,000 per week) Robbie Keane  £2.76m (£53,000 per week) Thierry Henry  £2.67m (£51,000 per week) Tim Cahill  £2.22m (£42,000 per week) Jermaine Jones  £1.99m (£38,000 per week) Marco Di Vaio  £1.59m (£30,000 per week) But more staggering than wages of the high earners is the discrepancy between those players and their less talented, and less fortunate, team-mates. Many players in the league earn as little as £22,000 a year, or £420 a week, which is less than the average salary in the UK. To put that into perspective, it would take Manuel Aparicio three and a half years to earn what his Toronto team-mate Michael Bradley does in a week. Moreover, when Clint Dempsey joined Seattle Sounders from Tottenham last summer, his salary was more than the entire payroll for 15 of the 19 MLS teams. A number of other former Premier League players are also earning high salaries in the US. The evergreen Obafemi Martins picks up an annual salary more than £1m while Liam Ridgewell earns around £750,000 a year. Bradley Wright-Phillips, who has scored 25 goals in 35 games for New York Red Bulls, earns £230,000 annually. Arsenal legend Thierry Henry, who moved to New York Red Bulls in 2010, is the seventh highest MLS earner . Michael Bradley, who plays for Toronto FC, is the third highest earner on the list behind Dempsey and Kaka . Former Spurs man Robbie Keane earns more than his one time north London rival Thierry Henry . David Villa, who joined the recently formed New York City FC from Barcelona during the summer, is listed as earning just £60,000 a year. The figure is misleading, though, as the majority of his salary is currently being paid by A-League side Melbourne City, where he is currently on loan. Similarly, Frank Lampard is not included on the list because he is not due to return from his loan at Manchester City until 2015. Regardless of some of the smaller numbers on show, the growth of the league is clear to see. In 2013 there were just seven players earning more than a million dollars annually. In 2014 that number has more than doubled, and that doesn't even include the full salaries of Frank Lampard and David Villa who are likely to take the total number of million-dollar players to 17.

"Nordstrom has fired a sales associate who made a statement about killing police on his Facebook page. Aaron Hodges, 37, of Portland, suggested killing a white officer for every black man killed by police. His comment quickly circulated online, prompting complaints both online and directly to his employer. Nordstrom spokeswoman Tara Darrow said the department store chain does not tolerate violence, violent conversation or 'threats of any kind.' Controversy: Aaron Hodges, 37, of Portland, suggested killing a white officer for every black man killed by police. His comment quickly circulated online, prompting complaints both online and directly to his employer . Fired: Hodges was an employee at the downtown Portland Nordstrom location, but has been fired as the company distances itself from his comments . 'What our former employee chose to post from his personal account does not in any way reflect our views as a company,' said Darrow said. We do not tolerate violence, violent conversation or threats of any kind.' The post in question, reports KGW, read: . 'Every time an unarmed black man is killed, you kill a decorated white officer, on his doorstep in front of his family.' Hodges, who is African-American, said Tuesday he's troubled by the police killings of Michael Brown in Missouri, Eric Garner in New York and Tamir Rice in Ohio, and he made the Facebook comment in an exchange with a friend from high school. Hodges said he sometimes says outrageous things to 'bring things into scope' and didn't literally mean that white officers should be killed. 'I'm a black Mormon, so there's no way I could be racist,' he said. 'I'm just passionate about black issues because nobody else seems to be.' Hodges said a manager from the downtown Portland store called him Friday to say people were calling nonstop and he must remove references to his Nordstrom employment from his Facebook page. The next day, Hodges said, a manager told him to stay away until Wednesday, because there had been a death threat. 'And then the store manager called me on Sunday and was like: 'We can't support you anymore Aaron. We got to let you go.' Given the flood of complaints, Hodges said he understands why Nordstrom fired him, but he doesn't understand why someone took a screen shot of his Facebook comment and destroyed his livelihood. 'I would never think to do something like that,' he said. 'If you and I have a problem, I handle it with you. I don't go behind your back.' Hodges said he worked at Nordstrom for six months in the sportswear department and won an award for customer service. Now unemployed, he plans to print about 50 resumes this week and hit the streets looking for a job. 'Whatever job I've had, I've excelled at, so I'm not worried,' he said. 'All I need is a foot in the door.' Hodges defended himself, saying, ''I'm a black Mormon, so there's no way I could be racist...I'm just passionate about black issues because nobody else seems to be'","Aaron Hodges suggested the murder of a white officer for every black man killed by police in a post to a friend .

"Click here to read what Henry told Sportsmail's Matt Barlow about Sky move . Thierry Henry has become the best-paid pundit in English football by a distance after joining Sky Sports as a football expert and ambassador from the start of next year. His pay packet is said to dwarf that of Sky colleague Gary Neville, who is believed to be paid £1.2million a year. The terms of Henry’s mega-deal still allow him to work for the BBC at major tournaments, as he did during Brazil last summer. But he is not permitted to work for Sky’s arch-rivals BT Sport, who were also keen on signing him. Thierry Henry has become the best-paid pundit in English football by a distance after joining Sky Sports . Henry's pay packet is said to dwarf that of  Gary Neville (right), who is believed to be paid £1.2million a year . Henry has shelved his coaching ambitions to accept a six-year deal with Sky, worth £4m a year. After two decades scoring goals, the 37-year-old Frenchman said: ‘It feels like a logical step. It gives me the possibility to stay close to the game and help people understand it better.’ He has in the past spoken of his desire to coach, and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said the door would always be open for him at Arsenal. Henry added: ‘That is the plan, to go through that process, but we are far from that at the moment. Everyone is busy at Arsenal and nobody is going to stop what they’re doing for me.’ Henry joins the likes of Neville, Jamie Redknapp, Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness in the Sky Sports stable. Henry moved from Juventus to Arsenal in August 1999 for a fee of about £11m under Arsene Wenger . The French striker played for Monaco, Juventus, Arsenal, Barcelona and New York Red Bulls during an illustrious career, scoring a total of 360 goals in 792 appearances. He also played for France on 123 occasions, scoring 51 times. Henry lifted the Premier League title twice and the FA Cup three times before adding the Champions League with Barcelona in 2009. He also won the World Cup with France in 1998 and the European Championship in 2000. Sport England are understood to have spent more than £2m setting up the ‘spogo’ website as a tool to help browsers find local sports clubs. But just two years later, the site is being merged with a London 2012 legacy initiative Be Inspired because hardly anyone was using the Sport England facility. This extravagance follows the eye-popping £3m a year Sport England spent on their Active People Survey, the expensive findings from which have been delayed because of botched data research. A Sport England spokesman said: ‘We believe the website merger makes sense because we can bring together facilities and people to better effect, and the APS research is critical to our funding decisions.’ The BBC’s website made its contribution to the general unease that has greeted the overwhelming size of Lewis Hamilton’s victory over favourite Rory McIlroy in the Sports Personality of the Year vote. The first news the Beeb put up online after the votes were counted was that McIlroy had won. A spokesman said: ‘It was human error and was taken down immediately.’ The BBC mistakenly put online that Rory McIlroy (right) had won Sports Personality of the Year rather than actual winner Lewis Hamilton (pictured centre next to third-placed Jo Pavey) Paul McGinley, who was widely praised for his Ryder Cup captaincy, is already starting to prepare meticulously for leading Ireland’s 2016 Olympic golf challenge, including visits to the unfinished course in Rio. The professional focus of McGinley, who took a tour of the FA’s St George’s Park just to keep abreast of coaching ideas, contrasts with the shambolic British entry into rugby sevens that will not even name a manager until next year. Paul McGinley is already starting to prepare meticulously for leading Ireland’s 2016 Olympic golf challenge . PR LURE FOR BEVINGTON? The departure from the FA of Club England managing director Adrian Bevington has been inevitable since technical director designate Dan Ashworth announced his vision to the FA board after the World Cup. Ashworth’s presentation of his ‘England DNA’ blueprint for national teams was well received and allowed him effectively to take charge of the future direction of England football from St George’s Park. Bevington, who was also impressed by Ashworth’s talk, realised Club England — which he had led since its formation in 2010 — had been kicked into the long grass and it crystallised his desire to leave the FA. The departure from the FA of Club England managing director Adrian Bevington had been inevitable . Bevington declared before the World Cup that his ambition is to be a club chief executive and had always seen 2014 as his likely leaving date. A negotiated settlement gives him time to find the right football post. But he will have no difficulty picking up a top PR job after his consummate work in his other role as FA director of communications handling crisis after crisis at Wembley. Bevington’s Club England post has been made virtually redundant, meaning the replacement for general secretary Alex Horne, who will leave at the end of next month, will have to involve himself closely with England matters. Bevington shows UEFA President Michel Platini around St Georges Park during a visit last month . Meanwhile, the pressure is now firmly on Greg Dyke, not the easiest FA chairman to work with, to steady the ship following the exits of Horne and Bevington in quick succession. Members of FIFA’s executive committee, led by Germany’s Theo Zwanziger, calling for Michael Garcia’s World Cup corruption report to be published in full will find their cause made that much harder by the FIFA appeals committee rejecting Garcia’s complaint that the summary of his report was ‘incomplete and erroneous’. The appeal was considered inadmissible because by the statement by ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert was not legally binding, and thus not subject to appeal. Typical FIFA dysfunctionality.","Thierry Henry has become the best paid pundit in football after joining Sky .

"An ex-staffer for Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold is suing the married congressman's office for wrongful termination,  court documents discovered today reveal. The plaintiff in the case, Farenthold's former communications director, Lauren Greene, alleges that the congressman and his chief of staff engaged in 'hostile conduct' toward her and that Farenthold sexually harassed her on multiple occasions. She also claims in the lawsuit that the Texas lawmaker 'regularly drank to excess' and had 'a tendency to flirt' at Capitol Hill functions with women who were not his wife. On one occasion the congressman allegedly told his aides that a 'female lobbyist had propositioned him for a ""threesome."" ' On another, Greene says he told her that he and his 'estranged' wife Debbie had not had sex in years. Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold is pictured here with his wife Debbie and his children Morgan and Amanda. A former staffer of Farenthold is taking him to court over claims that he sexually harassed her and fired her without just cause . Farenthold's former communications director, Lauren Greene, alleges in her lawsuit that the Texas lawmaker 'regularly drank to excess' and had 'a tendency to flirt' at Capitol Hill functions with women who were not his wife . Greene also claims that after the chief of staff complained that her shirt was 'transparent' and he could see her nipples, Farenthold told his personal assistant that as far as he was concerned, Greene 'could show her nipples whenever she wanted to.' The court filing, first uncovered by the National Law Journal, was submitted to the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia on Friday and charges that Farenthold's office violated the Congressional Accountability Act when it fired Greene in July. According to the court documents, Greene began working in Farenthold's office in February 2013 as the new media director. The following January she was promoted to communications director after the congressman's previous spokesperson gave notice. A review of her pay stubs on congressional database Legistorm confirms that much. On what was to be her first day in the new position, however, Greene claims she was informed by the chief of staff in the office, Bob Haueter, that she would have to interview for the job and that he was also speaking with other candidates. He ended up formally offering her the position the next day, but Greene says he made her 'professional life unbearable' and five months later she was fired after making her concerns about Haueter's behavior known to the congressman. While the court filing names the 'hostile work environment' that both Farenthold and Haueter allegedly created as the reason for the lawsuit, it specifies that 'gender discrimination' was the reason for Greene's mistreatment. According to the former aide, several weeks before her promotion, she told Farenthold's executive assistant Emily Wilkes that the congressman 'was awkward toward her at work and regularly seemed to try to avoid interacting with her.' Wilkes in turn shared that the congressman and father of two 'had admitted to being attracted' to Greene and having 'sexual fantasies' and 'wet dreams' about her. 'Farenthold knew that Wilkes and Plaintiff were friends and confidantes and that Wilkes would likely convey his comments to Plaintiff, which is exactly what happened on this and other occasions,' the lawsuit contends. After finding out the sexual fantasies, Greene said she was 'anxious' to avoid one-on-one meetings with the congressman, and he seemed to avoid her, too, making it difficult to her do her job. Yet the court documents also claim that the congressman 'regularly' made comments toward Green that were meant to determine her interest in a 'sexual relationship.' One time 'Farenthold told Greene that she had something on her skirt and that he hoped his comment wouldn’t be taken for sexual harassment,' the document says. 'A reasonable person would infer that Farenthold was joking that she had semen on her skirt,' it goes on to say. Another time Greene says the congressman told her that her skirt was partly unzipped. Upon inspecting her skit in the bathroom 'she realized that the opening was so small that Farenthold would have had to be staring at her closely to notice.' After word got out on Tuesday about Greene's lawsuit against her former employer, she deleted her twitter account - but not before MailOnline took a screenshot of it . No stranger to controversy: This 2009 photo of Farenthold posing with a model, taken at a Texas night club, caused a stir on the eve of his election in 2010. He still beat his Democratic opponent, though, and has cruised to reelection ever since . The lawsuit indicates that it was the chief of staff's terse relationship with Greene that ultimately led to her firing, not the congressman's unwanted advances. The filing lists numerous ways in which the chief of staff undercut her, including publicly humiliating her at staff meetings and 'blaming her for errors and failings committed by others.' She eventually set up a meeting with Farenthold at which point she alerted him that the chief of staff was 'bullying her and treating her in a very hostile fashion.' 'Farenthold replied that Haueter was known to be condescending toward women on the staff, and then paid empty, lip service encouragement for Plaintiff to stand up for herself,' the lawsuit states. After that point both the congressman and Haueter 'marginalized and undermined' her, Greene claims, and several weeks later she was fired, without any warning. On Tuesday Farenthold's office rejected Greene's version of events and denied that it discriminated against her. 'It goes without saying that both the Congressman and the members of his staff who are included in this complaint have a very different view of the allegations than Ms. Greene,' Farenthold's current spokesman, Kurt Bardella, said in a statement to The National Law Journal. 'For the record, the Office did not and does not discriminate based on sex or any other unlawful factor. The Congressman is eager to respond to Ms. Greene's allegations through the appropriate legal process and is confident that once all of the facts are revealed, he will be cleared of any wrongdoing,' the statement continued. Worst week ever: Farenthold made headlines yesterday after a Twitter user discovered that the former entrepreneur still owned the domain name blowe-me.org . Farenthold was first elected to Congress in the Republican wave of 2010. In a true October surprise, a photo of the Texas politician in ducky pajamas standing next to a scantily-clad model at a night club was released two weeks before the election. The photo was revealed to have been taken a lingerie and pajama-themed birthday party fundraiser for a friend of Farenthold's. A news article from the time says that the money raised at the party was to benefit four charities: the American Heart Association, Big Brothers and Big Sisters of South Texas, the Gulf Coast Humane Society and the Women’s Shelter of South Texas. 'They say it’s some big-night-on-the-town party. It was a fundraiser for a local charity,' Farenthold said of the gathering. The conservative politician said he hadn't filed for office when he attended the event nearly a year earlier. 'But regardless of whether I was running for office or not, I’ll put on funny clothes if it’s going to raise money for charity,' Farenthold said. Despite taking flak for the photo, Farenthold went on to narrowly beat his Democratic opponent, incumbent Rep. Solomon Ortiz, in that November's midterm election. He's since won reelection easily as a result of changes to Texas' congressional map that made his district more Republican. Prior to being elected to Congress Farenthold worked as a lawyer and founded a web design company. His days as an entrepreneur caused another salacious problem for him this week when a Twitter user pointed out that he still owns the lewdly titled website blow-me.org. Roll Call followed up on the tip and determined that Farenthold purchased the domain name in 1999 and it expires on July 23, 2015. A second spokesman for Farenthold's office, Michael Rekola, confirmed to the news publication on Monday that site was in fact registered to the three-term representative. 'Prior to serving in Congress, Mr. Farenthold operated a computer consulting company that routinely bought domain names including the one in question. The domain name has never been used and Mr. Farenthold has no intention to renew it,' Rekola said.","Republican lawmaker Blake Farenthold's former communications alleges that the congressman sexually harassed her on multiple occasions .

AMIR KHAN: Really sorry to hear the news about @ant_crolla hope you get well soon mate . TONY BELLEW: My heart goes out to him! The nicest kid in boxing full stop! His world title challenge against Richar Abril, scheduled for January 23 at the Manchester Arena, has been postponed. Crolla's promoter Eddie Hearn told Sportsmail: 'We're devastated for Anthony and his family, you couldn't meet a nicer guy in boxing. 'It was a dream to get him his world title shot. I've alerted Abril's team and hopefully we can rearrange it but we don't know the extent of Anthony's injuries. 'His health is our first concern.' Crolla was deep in training for his fight with Cuban Abril who holds the WBA title. And his trainer Joe Gallagher told the Manchester Evening News: 'He could have been killed. 'I've just spoken to him on the phone and he's heart-broken. He's all plastered-up and waiting for a CT scan. His title dream is gone. Whether he will ever get another shot at it in the future, I don't know. His dreams are in tatters.' Crolla lands a punch on John Murray on his way to victory over his close friend in Manchester this year . Crolla has rebuilt his career since losing to Derry Mathews in a British title fight two years ago. A draw in the rematch a year later was followed by an impressive win over Gavin Rees and stoppages of Stephen Foster and John Murray. Crolla had said about the scheduled fight with Abril: 'To have the world title shot in Manchester is a huge factor. 'Without wanting to sound cheesy, it doesn't get any bigger than that. I am a Manchester lad so to be fighting in Manchester for a world title, I couldn't ask for anything more and the only way it could get better than that is to go out there and win it.' Crolla is the third boxer to suffer serious injuries this year. World welterweight champion Kell Brook only recently returned to training after he was stabbed in the leg in Tenerife while former European champion Jamie Moore was shot in both legs in Marbella in August. Crolla was due to fight Richar Abril for the WBA ligthweight title next month but that has been shelved .","Anthony Crolla was injured after confronting two intruders .

"Luis Suarez's summer move from Liverpool to Barcelona looks set to be the most costly deal in 2014. The Catalan giants may have only had to pay a figure of around £75million for the Uruguayan but when taking into account the range of additional fees during his five-year contract, Suarez's move could potentially cost Barca up to £199m. This far from princely sum eclipses the 2013 calculated total for Gareth Bale's move to Real Madrid, which looks likely to cost the La Liga leaders around £158m during the Welshman's stay in Spain. Luis Suarez's move from Liverpool to Barcelona looks set to be the most costly deal in 2014 . Suarez in action for Barca during his club's 3-1 Champions League win against Paris Saint-Germain . The 27-year-old's five-year deal could cost Barca close to £199million . Luis Suarez to Barcelona - £199m . Angel Di Maria to Manchester United - £190.4m . James Rodriguez to Real Madrid - £133.5m .

David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain - £90.9m . Eliaquim Mangala to Manchester City -£87.7m . Although Barca stand to spend the most on a single player, the 2014 Goal Transfer List, calculates that Manchester United's busy transfer windows in 2014 will eventually see the Old Trafford club having to part with close to £400m on the likes of Angel di Maria, Luke Shaw and Juan Mata. Elsewhere, Di Maria's £60m move to United sees the Argentine in second place in 2014's most costly transfers, potentially commanding a figure of £190.4m once considering details such as original fee, tax, salary and length of contract. Arsene Wenger, who has been accused of being reluctant to splash Arsenal's cash in recent years, will see his club fork out around £133m during Alexis Sanchez's time at the Emirates. Gunners faithful will argue, however, that the diminutive Chilean has been worth every penny of his £35m fee after nine goals in 16 Premier League games so far this season. Angel di Maria's £60m move to Manchester United is second on the 2014 most costly transfers list . United stand to spend close to £400m after big money deals for the likes of Juan Mata (left) and Luke Shaw . Alexis Sanchez has already scored nine Premier League goals, but his deal could cost Arsenal £113m . The top 10 list, compiled by Goal, also includes four Chelsea deals with their Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas moves eventually costing the Blues over £200m while the £50m summer sale of David Luiz could cost Paris Saint-Germain up to £90.9m with Mata's January move eventually taking around £96.4m from United's pocket. The 2014 list also shows the increase in club spending across Europe, with the combined cost rising by 27 per cent compared to last year's compilation. Interestingly, nine of the top 10  deals in 2014 include at least one Premier League club while not a single club from Serie A or the Bundesliga feature in the big money moves. James Rodriguez's move from Monaco to Real Madrid is the only transfer to feature on the top 10 list which didn't involve a Premier League club .

"The New York premiere of the Sony movie that is at the center of its hacking crisis has been cancelled after it was threatened with a terrorist attack. Screenings of the movie have also been cancelled at thousands of theaters across the country. Early Tuesday, the hacking group Guardians of Peace, who have been systematically releasing email correspondence and leaking films after breaking into Sony's internal system, claimed an event similar to '11th of September 2001' would occur at theaters showing the film. North Korean hackers are believed to be behind the cyber attack and now terrorist threat, angered over the film which tells the story of two men who travel to the secretive communist nation to kill leader, Kim Jong-un. The Carmike Cinemas chain, which operates 278 theaters in 41 states, is now the first chain who will not be showing the film when it opens. California's ArcLight cinemas. whose Hollywood location is one of the most famed and popular theaters in the country, will also not be showing the film. Also backing out is Landmark Cinemas, who have now cancelled the film's New York premiere which was scheduled for Thursday at the famed Sunshine Cinema in the city's Lower East Side. Scroll down for video . Problems: Hackers have made ominous '9/11-like' threats against movie theaters showing Sony Pictures' film The Interview (above) starring James Franco and Seth Rogen . Problem child: The hackers are believed to be North Korean, and angered over the film, which tells the story of two men sent to kill Kim Jong-un (above) Let it go: Now Sony and its studo heads Amy pascal (center) and Michael Lynton (right, with producer Scott Rudin on left) have told movie theaters they can pull the film . Despite all this however, Sony said they will not stop from distributing the film, set to open on Christmas. The New York Times reports, 'Three people briefed on Sony’s internal discussions on Tuesday said the studio had decided to all but invite theater owners to force cancellation or further postponement of The Interview.' The Times also spoke to one theater owner, who asked to remain anonymous, that called the reference to the 9/11 attacks a 'game changer.' Patrick Corcoran, spokesman for the National Association of Theater Owners, wouldn't comment on the threats. Mail Online has contacted cinema groups including Regal Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment and Cinemark for comment. All three companies experienced a drop in their stock price after the threat was announced. The chief executive of Sony Entertainment, Michael Lynton, sent an email to employees on Tuesday in which he told staff to ‘remain vigilant.’ ‘We are aware of the latest threat and are working closely with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. Please remain vigilant,’ he wrote. The FBI has confirmed that it is looking into the credibility of the threat, with a spokesperson saying; 'The FBI is aware of recent threats and continues to work collaboratively with our partners to investigate.' However a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security has said that they don't believe that the threats are credible. 'We are still analyzing the credibility of these statements, but at this time there is no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters within the United States,' said the spokesperson. Laying low? On Wednesday night, Franco was seen leaving a restaurant in New York wearing a hat and scarf while holding some  headphones . Not backing down: Sony has also said that despite the threat, they will still be distributing the film . The Interview is a comedy in which Rogen and Franco star as television journalists involved in a CIA plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Speculation about a North Korean link to the Sony hacking has centered on that country's angry denunciation of the film. Over the summer, North Korea warned that the film's release would be an ‘act of war that we will never tolerate,' threatening a ‘merciless’ retaliation. The FBI has said that it is investigating the attack but has declined to comment on whether North Korea or another country was behind the attack. As the Times points out in their article, a film depicting the murder of a sitting world leader is almost unprecedented. The Guardians of Peace threat released on Tuesday reads: . Warning . We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places The Interview be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to. Soon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made. The world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, you’d better leave.) Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment. All the world will denounce the SONY. Some in the industry are also saying major theater chains that are publicly traded companies may not be able to even show the movie for fear of serious legal repercussions should these threats ultimately be true. 'If something does happen at theaters showing The Interview, today’s hacker threat means that no one can say they didn’t know or at the very least have a reasonable expectation, explains Deadline. And that means that any victims or their families could sue the theater or theater chain, and would likely win. This is much different than the mass shooting that happened in an Aurora, Colorado theater during a 2012 screening The Dark Knight Rises as neither the studio, Paramount, or the theater had any idea that there would be an incident of such horrific violence. That has not stopped many from suing the Cinemark owned Aurora Century 16 multiplex though, citing the lack of security on the premises which allowed shooter James Eagan Holmes to open fire during a midnight screening, killing 12 and injuring 70. And there is a very good chance they will win their cases, as over the summer a judge in Colorado ruled against Cinemark's attempts to dismiss these lawsuits. 'This is a horror show that doesn’t seem to end,' long time media investor Harold Vogel told Deadline. 'Why can’t this picture just be pulled off totally? Why do you need this headache? There are plenty of other pictures out there. All these things are made in the self-reflective echo chamber of Hollywood.' Not happy: Other studios like Disney, who is releasing Into the Woods (above) on Christmas, could also be affected by these threats . Angie: The highly anticpated Unbroken, directed by Angelina Jolie, is also set to be released on Christmas . The famous water tower at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California . This threat is also problematic for other studios releasing tent-pole films on Christmas. There are three other major releases on the holiday; Disney's Into the Woods, Universal's Unbroken and Paramount's The Gambler. Fear among the public to go to theaters showing The Interview will no doubt affect the box office of these films as well. Also not helping the film may be the reviews coming in, that are decidedly mixed. USA Today's Claudia Puig writes; 'Considering the controversy and chaos Sony Pictures Studios is undergoing because of it, The Interview fails to live up to the hype, floundering as a rowdy comedy as it grows duller by the minute.' Even harsher was Variety, with Scott Foundas writing; 'An alleged satire that’s about as funny as a communist food shortage, and just as protracted.'","Guardians of Peace have released a chilling new message including ominous threats against cinemas showing Sony's The Interview .
The threat makes reference to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 .

"Nintendo games consoles might be wrapped up under a lot of trees this Christmas but scientists have found that unless you take plenty of breaks from playing, you might just end up in hospital. Nintendo consoles have been linked to dozens of injuries to gamers, including Wii-itis to a stroke, . While most have suffered little more than a sore thumb from hammering the buttons too hard, some have been struck down with life threatening injuries from playing too much. Scientist found 38 cases of Nintendo related injuries and problems ranging from neurological and psychological to surgical . Two patients were rushed to hospital having had a stroke after playing on a Nintendo Wii, while another needed surgery for a hernia after exercising on the Wii Fit game. A 55-year-old woman was also found to have suffered a massive chest bleed after falling on to her sofa while playing tennis on her Wii. The injuries were uncovered after a team of Dutch researchers gathered all reported cases of Nintendo-related problems to see whether it was a safe present to give at Christmas. After searching two medical databases they found 38 reports of injuries and problems ranging from neurological and psychological to surgical. The findings, published in the Christmas issue of the British Medical Journal, include early reports of seizures, dubbed 'Nintendo epilepsy'. There were also two cases of Nintendo-related incontinence, where children were so engrossed in playing Super Mario Bros they ignored the need to got to the toilet. A case of 'Nintendo neck' was reported in a child playing his Game Boy for 30 minutes in a hunched position, while 'Nintendo elbow' was diagnosed in a 12-year-old who played his console 'a lot' for more than a month. Nintendo-related problems in the thumb, hand and wrist are referred to as 'nintendinitis' or 'nintendonitis', and were associated with strenuous game play using a traditional controller with buttons or a joystick. Nintendo, who produces the Wii, says it is committed to the safety of its customers . After receiving more than 90 complaints, Nintendo handed out protective gloves to all owners of the game Mario Party, in which players had to rotate the joystick quickly with their thumb. And after Nintendo introduced the Wii in 2006, with its motion-sensitive remote controller, there were reports of injuries arising from playing its most popular game, Wii Sports. A 29-year-old man was found to have acute tendinitis in his right shoulder after playing the game for several hours. Another report described a case of carpal tunnel syndrome in a woman who played a bowling game for six to eight hours daily for 10 days. There were also two reports of Achilles 'wii-itis' - a partial tear of the Achilles tendon. Tennis was found to be the most dangerous Wii sport overall, and the most common injuries were hand lacerations and bruising. The researchers, led by Dr Maarten Jalink of the University of Groningen, said: 'Overall, a Nintendo is a relatively safe Christmas present. 'However, those who receive such a gift should not swing the controller too hard, they should be careful about where they play, and they should take frequent breaks.' A spokesman for Nintendo said: 'The Wii video game system is often credited with getting people up off the couch. But, as with any activity, people playing the Wii system, or any other Nintendo product should pace themselves and not overdo it. 'Nintendo is committed to the safety of its customers and always includes comprehensive health and safety guidelines with its products. Provided these are followed correctly, a user should be able to enjoy their Nintendo product safely.'","Dutch researchers looked at whether Nintendo consoles are a safe present .

"FIFA ethics investigator Michael Garcia has lost his appeal against the findings which cleared Qatar and Russia to host the 2022 and 2018 World Cups. Garcia last month claimed a statement by ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert on his report into bidding for the World Cups had contained 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions' and announced he would appeal. That appeal has now been declared inadmissible by FIFA's appeals committee, who said Eckert's statement was not a legally-binding decision and therefore could not be appealed against. Ethics investigator Michael Garcia's appeal has been dismissed by FIFA . Eckert's statement said any rule breaches by the bidding countries were 'of very limited scope', adding: 'In particular, the effects of these occurrences on the bidding process as a whole were far from reaching any threshold that would require returning to the bidding process, let alone reopening it.' A FIFA statement said: 'The FIFA appeal committee, chaired by Larry Mussenden, has concluded that the appeal lodged by the chairman of the investigatory chamber, Michael J. Garcia, against the statement of the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of the independent ethics committee, Hans-Joachim Eckert, is not admissible. Michael Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert pictured together earlier this year . 'The said statement about the report on the inquiry into the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process does not constitute a decision and as such is neither legally binding nor appealable.' Meanwhile, complaints by two World Cup bid whistleblowers that their cover had been blown by Eckert's findings have also been rejected. Phaedra Almajid, who worked for the Qatar 2022 bid team before losing her job in 2010, and Bonita Mersiades, who worked for Australia's 2022 bid, complained that promises of confidentiality had been breached because his findings contained more than enough information to make them easily identifiable. Almajid said in a statement: 'The conclusion of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee dismissing my complaint against Herr Eckert for breaching my confidentiality is a transparent avoidance of a clear violation of its own rules. 'I cooperated with Mr. Garcia’s investigation for over two and a half years under a clear, unqualified promise of confidentiality. He asked me for my confidentiality and repeatedly promised me mine. I kept my promise. Herr Eckert breached that confidentiality. I did not. The Disciplinary Committee’s avoidance of this undisputable violation is emblematic of its culture of self-protection. 'The Disciplinary Committee’s assertion that I had “gone public with [my] own media activities long before the publication” of Herr Eckert’s statement is an obvious dodge. My public statements were all made long before I entered into a confidentiality agreement with Mr. Garcia. 'I made no public statements during the entire period of Mr. Garcia’s investigation. I relied on FIFA’s promise of confidentiality and continued to honor my promise until Herr Eckert published his “Summary.” My recent public statements have only been made AFTER Herr Eckert’s identification of me in blatant violation of FIFA confidentiality rules. 'The Disciplinary Committee’s decision today is one more example of an organization whose rules are mere formalities meaning nothing.'","Garcia claimed last month his intention to appeal against findings which cleared Qatar and Russia to host 2022 and 2018 World Cups .

"Read Sportsmail's Matt Barlow on the rise of  teen sensation Martin Odegaard . Martin Odegaard visited Arsenal on Tuesday as he continued his tour of Europe's biggest clubs - but Bayern Munich remain confident they will land his signature. Bayern were hoping they could announce the Norwegian wonderkid's signing as early as Wednesday, the date of Odegaard's 16th birthday, but the Gunners' late interest may have thrown a spanner in the works. Odegaard, who will also move on to visit Manchester United before making another trip to Liverpool while in England. has trained at Bayern and Liverpool in recent weeks with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United and Manchester City also registering an interest.

Celtic, managed by Odegaard's former boss at Stromsgodset, Ronny Deila, are keen to bring the teenager to Glasgow but they are outsiders for his signature. Stromsgodset will be due a compensation package should Odegaard opt to leave his homeland. The attacking midfielder has made 25 appearances for Stromsgodset since making his debut in April and has scored five goals. He already has three full caps for Norway having made his debut in August. Odegaard has been guided in negotiations by his father, Hans Erik, who was a professional footballer in the Norwegian league and who is now the assistant manager at Mjondalen. Hans Erik was also at Arsenal on Tuesday as his son trained with the first-team. Celtic boss Ronny Deila (right) gave Odegaard his debut at Stromsgodset before leaving for the Scottish giants .

Speaking recently, Celtic boss Ronny Deila said his club have not made their interest in Odegaard known officially to Stromsgodset but believes his contacts in Drammen will keep him informed of any developments. ‘I haven’t (made Celtic’s interest clear),’ he said. ‘But I have control over the situation. ‘I know what’s happening. He’s in the town where my kids live and I know a lot of people there. ‘We’ll see. If there are possibilities, of course, we will try it. But it’s a very hard competition.’ With five loan signings on Celtic’s books just now, Deila had not discounted the possibility of attempting to bring Odegaard to Glasgow for a season were he to head for the continent. ‘You never know, but we want to have players that we want to get something for if we develop them,’ he said. ‘You can’t have too many players from other clubs. We need to have players who we can earn money on or who can stay at our club.’ Asked if Odegaard was good enough at the moment to play for Celtic, Deila replied: ‘It’s very hard to say. He’s only 15 years old and will be 16 this month, but he is very special and every time he gets to a new level, he takes his chance. His attitude is great - he always wants to learn and he listens to everything you say.

"Cities really are brighter places during the holidays, Nasa has revealed. In a series of stunning images, it found the holidays can cause a cities lights to be boosted by 50%. The series of pictures shows Christmas and New Year's in the United States and the holy month of Ramadan in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . City lights shine brighter during the holidays in the United States when compared with the rest of the year, as shown using a new analysis of daily data from the NASA-NOAA Suomi NPP satellite. Dark green pixels are areas where lights are 50 percent brighter, or more, during December. The Suomi NPP satellite, a joint Nasa/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) mission, carries an instrument called the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). VIIRS can observe the dark side of the planet – and detect the glow of lights in cities and towns worldwide. The new analysis of holiday lights uses an advanced algorithm, developed at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, that filters out moonlight, clouds and airborne particles in order to isolate city lights on a daily basis. 'Even from space, holidays shine bright,' Nasa said. Researchers analysed daily data from the NOAA/Nasa Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. They were able to track how patterns in nighttime light intensity change during major holiday seasons – Christmas and New Year's in the United States and the holy month of Ramadan in the Middle East. Around many major U.S. cities, nighttime lights shine 20 to 50 percent brighter during Christmas and New Year's when compared to light output during the rest of the year, as seen in the satellite data. In some Middle Eastern cities, nighttime lights shine more than 50 percent brighter during Ramadan, compared to the rest of the year. The new analysis of holiday lights uses an advanced algorithm, developed atNASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, that filters out moonlight, clouds and airborne particles in order to isolate city lights on a daily basis. The data from this algorithm provide high-quality satellite information on light output across the globe, allowing scientists to track when – and how brightly – people illuminate the night. In the United States, the lights started getting brighter on 'Black Friday,' the day after Thanksgiving, and continued through New Year's Day, said Miguel Román, a research physical scientist at Nasa Goddard and member of the Suomi NPP Land Discipline Team, who co-led this research. He and his colleagues examined the light output in 2012 and 2013 in 70 U.S. cities, as a first step in determining patterns in urban energy use – a key factor in greenhouse gas emissions. In most suburbs and outskirts of major cities, light intensity increased by 30 to 50 percent. Lights in the central urban areas did not increase as much as in the suburbs, but still brightened by 20 to 30 percent. 'It's a near ubiquitous signal. Despite being ethnically and religiously diverse, we found that the U.S. experiences a holiday increase that is present across most urban communities,' Román said. 'These lighting patterns are tracking a national shared tradition.' Because snow reflects so much light, the researchers could only analyze snow-free cities. They focused on the U.S. West Coast from San Francisco and Los Angeles, and cities south of a rough imaginary line from St. Louis to Washington, D.C. The team focused on the U.S. West Coast from San Francisco and Los Angeles, and cities south of a rough imaginary line from St. Louis to Washington, D.C. The new analysis of holiday lights uses an advanced algorithm, developed atNASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, that filters out moonlight, clouds and airborne particles in order to isolate city lights on a daily basis. The team also examined lighting patterns across 30 major towns in Puerto Rico, known for its vibrant nocturnal celebrations and for having one of the longest Christmas holiday periods. 'Overall, we see less light increases in the dense urban centers, compared to the suburbs and small towns where you have more yard space and single-family homes,' said Eleanor Stokes, a Nasa Jenkins Graduate Fellow and Ph.D. candidate at Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, New Haven, Connecticut, who co-led the study with Román. These new results, illustrating holidays in lights, were presented at the American Geophysical Union's Fall Meeting in San Francisco. The idea to look at holiday light-use patterns stemmed from one of the first analyses of the new daily lights algorithm, Román said. Colleagues from Nasa Goddard and Yale were looking data of Cairo in 2012 and noticed a large discrepancy. 'Either you have something going on with your data that's wrong, or there's a real signal there that you have to look into,'Román recalls them saying. When the team investigated the satellite record, they found that the large increase in light output in Egypt's capital corresponded with the holy month of Ramadan. During Ramadan, Muslims fast during the day, pushing meals and many social gatherings, markets, commerce and more to nighttime hours. In several cities in the Middle East, city lights brighten during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, as seen using a new analysis of daily data from the NASA-NOAA Suomi NPP satellite. Dark green pixels are areas where the lights are 50 percent brighter, or more, during Ramadan. To confirm that the nighttime signal was not merely an instrument artifact, they examined three consecutive years worth of data from 2012 through the fall of 2014. They found that the peaks in light use closely tracked the Islamic calendar, as Ramadan shifted earlier in the summer. But not all Middle Eastern cities responded the same as Cairo. Light use in Saudi Arabian cities, such as Riyadh and Jeddah, increased by about 60 to 100 percent through the month of Ramadan. Light use in Turkish cities, however, increased far less. Some regions in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon did not have an increase in light output, or even demonstrated a moderate decrease, possibly due to unstable electrical grids or conflict in the region. 'Even within majority Muslim populations, there are a lot of variations,' Stokes said. 'What we've seen is that these lighting patterns track cultural variation within the Middle East.'","Team looked at Christmas  in the United States and found lights shone 50% brighter during holiday season .

"He is one of the greatest of the Great War poets, was described as 'the handsomest young man in England' by fellow writer W.B Yeats and spent years travelling the world before dying tragically young during the Gallipoli campaign. But while the later career of Rupert Brooke, the author of the famous line: 'If I should die, think only this of me: that there's some corner of a foreign field that is forever England', is well known, his time spent travelling in Tahiti is shrouded in mystery. There, he was rumoured to have fathered a child with a local woman - rumours that were later brushed under the carpet by his family and have never been proved. Now Brooke's biographer Jill Dawson reveals why she believes the tales to be true - and presents compelling new evidence to suggest that the poet may indeed have been a father, although tragically, he would never know his daughter. Daughter of a poet: Alice Brooke, pictured second from right, is thought to be the war poet's daughter . 'The handsomest young man in England': Brooke in a 1913 photo taken ahead of his South Pacific trip . The Soldier, with its famous line: ‘If I should die, think only this of me: that there’s some corner of a foreign field that is forever England’, is one of the best-known poems in the English lexicon. But the idea that Rupert Brooke might have had a child, had left a part of himself deep in the South Seas islands, comes as a surprise to many. A child born out of wedlock to a Tahitian woman who some described as a prostitute doesn’t fit with the version of Brooke as a poster boy for the Establishment and patriotic feeling. In fact Brooke was a far more complex figure than this version allows: his prose writings give a much fuller picture of the man. He wrote a play, many wonderful letters, as well travel essays highly critical of British and American attitudes to the indigenous people of the South Seas. 'The white population of heaven must be very small indeed,' he claimed. He travelled by cruise ship to America, Canada New Zealand, Fiji and Tahiti in 1913 and his letters home show how bewitched he was by the South Sea islands: . ‘Hour after hour one may float in the warm lagoons, conscious in the whole body, of every shred and current of the multitudinous  water…..’ he wrote. He was also enchanted by Taatamata, a young woman with 'wonderful eyes' whom he met at the Tiare Hotel in Papeete, the capital of Tahiti, in 1913. 'She has wonderful eyes, the walk of a Goddess and heart of an angel,' wrote a smitten Brooke. She too was devoted to him. ‘I . think I shall write a book about her – only I fear I am too fond of . her,’ he wrote in a letter home. The five South Seas poems he went on to . publish in 1914 were infused with love for her and the islands. Battle: Brooke was supposed to take part in the Gallipoli campaign but was taken ill and died before he arrived . That, for most, is where the story of Rupert Brooke, Taatamata and the South Sea Islands end. But evidence suggests that it isn't quite true. On his return to the UK, Brooke wrote to his boyhood friend Dudley Ward and confessed to a dream in which his beloved Taatamata committed suicide. He was clearly worried about her.  'No mention of a baby,' he adds, suggesting that the possibility of having conceived one was high and played on his mind. A reply from Taatamata eventually reached him via an extraordinarily circuitous route. It was dated 2nd May 1914 and began ‘My dear Love darling’. It had been forwarded from Ottawa, having been recovered by divers from the Empress of India, the ship that had gone down in the St Lawrence Seaway, taking most of its passengers with it. Although . rather bedraggled by the time he was able to read it, the letter . confirmed his suspicions.  In a mixture of French, English and Tahitian . his Polynesian girlfriend writes: 'Sweetheart....I grow fat all time.' Brooke’s . reaction is unknown. There the trail ends. It wasn’t until 21 years . after Rupert Brooke’s death that Dudley Ward began making enquiries . about the existence of a child. By . then 50 years old, a CBE and a member of the Treasury, it’s doubtful . that Ward would have bothered if he hadn’t had a strong inkling that . such a child was probable, so did Brooke confide in him? Paradise: Brooke's five South Sea poems were published in early 1914, a year before his tragically early death . A corner of a foreign field: Brooke's own corner is high in an olive grove on the Greek island of Skyros . Confidential: Brooke confided in his boyhood friend, the Cambridge economist Dudley Ward . The date of Ward’s detective work coincides with the death of Brooke’s mother. Ward, perhaps sensitive to the hurt it might cause, preferred to let the rumours well alone while Mrs Brooke was alive. Ward's search for the truth began with a letter to Norman Hall, director of Mutiny on the Bounty, asking if he knew of Tataamata, apparently ‘the only woman that Rupert Brooke really cared about’. Hall replied that she was well known to him, lived on Moorea, and was ‘still quite a handsome woman and must have been a very attractive girl when Brooke knew her’. He promised to ask about a child but if he did, there is no record of it. Norman Hall died in 1951 but his daughter confirmed that her mother had always known that Alice Rapoto, a close friend of the family, was the daughter of Brooke and Tataamata. She supplied the only known photograph of Alice who died around 1992 (if born in 1915 she would have been 77), although no records of birth or death confirm this. The islands of Tahiti and French Polynesia are about as far as it’s possible to travel from the UK and most biographers, including Mike Read, who came closest to the story in his biography Forever England, didn’t make the journey. In 2006 I began research on my novel The Great Lover about the life of Rupert Brooke and made the trip to Tahiti. Despite my enquiries I found no evidence of a child on that research trip so I wrote the novel anyway, using the logic of imagination and the inferences of Mike Read’s book and Taatamata’s letter.  This year – a month ago - I was invited back to a Salon du Livre festival in Tahiti’s capital, Papeete. While there I did some TV interviews and made general enquiries. I didn't look for documents in the knowledge that Polynesian culture is often casual about such things. I had some great conversations with other writers and translators and experienced anew the sensory assault that bewitched painters like Matisse and Gaugin. Brooke himself had painted a picture of the scene in words: 'And after dark, the black palms against a tropic night, the smell of the wind, the tangible moonlight like a white, dry translucent mist, the lights in the huts, the murmur and laughter of passing figures, the passionate, queer thrill of the rhythm of some hidden dance, all this will seems inexplicably and almost unbearably like a scene your heart has known long ago, and forgotten and yet always looked for.’ Still, confirmation of the existence of an Alice Brooke hadn't appeared. I returned home, although not before sending an email. And I struck lucky, although the evidence was anecdotal. The writer translating The Great Lover into French a teacher who lives on the nearby island of Ra’iatea, mentioned he’d been talking to a friend about me and my novel. His friend, Georgia, told him that as a child in the 1960s she met a beautiful woman with long grey hair, called Alice Brooke, living in grand house on the island of Moorea overlooking Tahiti. Everyone knew, Georgia says, that her father was the English poet, Rupert Brooke. There were children around, small children, thought to belong to Alice. It might not be the DNA evidence that a court would want but taken together, to me, there are too many coincidences to overlook. I like to think that living quietly in Tahiti are Alice's children, the grandchildren of Tatamaata and Rupert Brooke - one of the greatest poets the UK ever produced.

"Mario Balotelli is unlikely to return to Inter Milan in January, according to club vice-president Javier Zanetti. The 24-year-old Liverpool forward has failed to make an impact since moving to Anfield from AC Milan over the summer and has been linked with a move back to Italy. Inter are keen to strengthen their attacking line in the winter transfer market but Zanetti told Sky Italia: 'A Balotelli return? We all know Mario is a great player but I think it's difficult because he only just arrived at Liverpool. Mario Balotelli is enduring a nightmare start to his career at Liverpool following a £16m move . The Italian striker fluffed his lines in front of goal yet again in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester United on Sunday . 'In any case, after our game against Lazio (December 21) we will hold meetings to see what we can do and what is needed in terms of the (transfer) market.' Balotellli has scored only two goals in his 14 appearances for Liverpool. A return to the San Siro would see the Italy international reunited with Roberto Mancini, who coached Balotelli at Inter and Manchester City. Balotelli made his name as a talented but temperamental striker at Inter Milan . Mancini, who took the reins at Inter last month for a second spell in charge, revealed after Monday's 2-0 triumph at Chievo of the need for his side to bolster their attack. 'In certain roles in attack we are lacking,' Mancini told Gazzetta dello Sport. 'The club are aware of this but in January it will not be easy.'

"Scientists secretly vaccinated more than 2,000 children in religious-run homes in suspected illegal drug trials, it emerged today. Old medical records show that 2,051 children and babies in Irish care homes were given a one-shot diphtheria vaccine for international drugs giant Burroughs Wellcome between 1930 and 1936. There is no evidence that consent was ever sought, nor any records of how many may have died or suffered debilitating side-effects as a result. The scandal was revealed as Irish premier, Enda Kenny, ordered ministers to see whether there are more mass baby graves after . the discovery that 800 infants may be buried in a septic tank outside a former . mother and baby home in Tuam, Co. Galway. Children at Sean Ross Abbey in Tipperary are thought to have been used in secret drug trials in the 1930s . Children's homes are under the spotlight since it emerged that 796 babies may be buried at the former mother and baby home at Tuam, Co. Galway - Enda Kenny has ordered officials to see if other mass graves exist . The Irish premier has ordered his officials to examine the possibility that there may be other mass graves, too . The Taioseach intervened from the United States . yesterday to say that he had ordered his officials to 'see what the . scale is, what's involved here, and whether this is isolated or if there . are others around the country that need to be looked at.' Michael Dwyer, of Cork University’s . School of History, found the child vaccination data by trawling . through tens of thousands of medical journal articles and archive . files. He discovered that the trials were carried out before the vaccine was made available for . commercial use in the UK. Homes . where children were secretly tested included Bessborough, in Co. Cork . and Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea, Co. Tipperary, both of which are at the centre of . the mass baby graves scandal. Other institutions where children may also have been vaccinated include Cork orphanages St Joseph’s Industrial School for Boys, run by the Presentation Brothers, and St Finbarr’s Industrial School for Girls, run by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. In Dublin, it is believed that children for the trials came from St Vincent’s Industrial School, Goldenbridge, St Joseph’s School for Deaf Boys, Cabra, and St Saviours’s Dominican Orphanage. But Mr . Dwyer said: 'What I have found is just the tip of a very . large and submerged iceberg. 'The fact that no record of these trials can be found in the . files relating to the Department of Local Government and Public Health, . the Municipal Health Reports relating to Cork and Dublin, or the . Wellcome Archives in London, suggests that vaccine trials would not have . been acceptable to government, municipal authorities, or the general . public. 'However, . the fact that reports of these trials were published in the most . prestigious medical journals suggests that this type of human . experimentation was largely accepted by medical practitioners and . facilitated by authorities in charge of children’s residential . institutions.' Horror: The scandal of the babies in the mass grave was discovered by local historian, Catherine Corless . Innocence: Academic Michael Dwyer found out about the secret drugs trials by going through old medical records - children from the Sean Ross Abbey home in Tipperary, pictured, are thought to have been involved . A . spokesman for GSK – formerly Wellcome – said: 'The . activities that have been described to us date back over 70 years and, . if true, are clearly very distressing. 'We . would need further details to investigate what actually took place, but . the practices outlined certainly don’t reflect how modern clinical . trials are carried out. We conduct our trials to the same high . scientific and ethical standards, no matter where in the world they are . run.' A . spokeswoman for the Sisters of Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, the . order that ran Bessborough and Sean Ross Abbey, said that like GSK, they . would also welcome an independent inquiry. Fianna . Fáil leader Micheál Martin called on the Irish government to add vaccine . trials into the investigative remit of any inquiry into the mother and . baby homes. He said: 'We need to start with an independent investigation . into the mother and baby homes which would be followed by a wider . separate investigation into the vaccine testing.' Historian . Catherine Corless, whose discovery of the suspected mass baby grave at . Tuam was revealed by the Mail earlier this week, said her study of death . records for the St Mary's home run by Catholic Bon Secours nuns from . 1925-1961 pointed to the existence of the mass grave. Children's homes in Ireland were often the only place where a woman pregnant out of wedlock could go . Children were looked after by nuns and often adopted abroad - now it seems they were used in drugs trials, too . The Irish PM interrupted a . trade visit to San Francisco to order an inquiry in the Tuam home and others, saying that Dublin must decide . what is the 'best thing to do in the interest of dealing with yet . another element of our country's past.' St . Mary's was one of several such 'mother and baby' homes for 'fallen . women' who had become pregnant outside marriage in early 20th century . Ireland. Another . such institution was the Sean Ross Abbey in Tipperary, was where Philomena . Lee gave up her son for adoption in the 1950s. Her story was made into . the Oscar-nominated film 'Philomena' last year. The . 'mother and baby' homes accommodated women who were ostracised from their own families and had nowhere else to turn. Under . conservative Catholic teaching of the time, children born outside of . marriage were not baptised and were therefore denied a Catholic burial . on consecrated ground.","Scientists secretly gave 2,051 children and babies diphtheria vaccine .

"Real Madrid are 90 minutes from being crowned the best team on the planet after beating Mexican side Cruz Azul 4-0 to reach Saturday's World Club Cup final. With their 21st straight win they won their semi-final in Marrakech to set-up a potential showdown with the Copa Libertadores winners San Lorenzo who first need to beat Auckland City in Wednesday's second semi-final. Madrid started like a team that had won their last 20 games and could have been ahead inside three minutes when full back Dani Carvajal tore down the right and crossed to Karim Benzema. The Frenchman headed the ball down to Cristiano Ronaldo inside the six-yard box but his shot was saved at point-blank range by Jesus Corona in the Cruz Azul goal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo's rabona and match highlights of Real Madrid vs Cruz Azul .

Subs not used: Allison, Gutierrez, Castro, Chavez, Loeschbor,  Vela, Torres, Baez, Zurdo . The Mexican keeper was less impressive on 15 minutes when he came for Toni Kroos' corner and missed it, allowing Sergio Ramos to head it into the empty net. Carvajal had won the free-kick down the right and Kroos' perfect delivery was dispatched by Ramos, the man who got the all-important Champions League equaliser against Atletico Madrid, that helped put Real Madrid in this competition. It was Kroos' eighth assist of the season. He is still a long way from conversing fluently with his team-mates in Spanish but the understanding on the pitch is word perfect. At this stage of the campaign he looks like the signing of the summer. From the next Kroos corner Bale jumped to make contact and was punched by defender Hernan Bernardello as he landed; despite his complaints to the referee play continued. Kroos almost scored himself on the half hour with a stinging shot that Corona pushed away. Then minutes from the break Benzema got the second, turning in the ever-dangerous Carvajal's cross from the right. The full back was pushing Kroos for man-of-the-match and Benzema's execution was worthy of the assist. When Cruz Azul looked as if they had found a way back into the game Iker Casillas slammed the door shut. Ramos was harshly judged to have brought down Mariano Pavone but when Gerardo Torrado stepped up to take the spot-kick Casillas guessed right and pushed it round his post. He was up to the challenge again moments later when a poor back pass from Asier Illaramendi let in Pavone but the Spain keeper came out to make the save.

Five minutes into the second half Gareth Bale made it 3-0, heading in Ronaldo's cross after the Portuguese had been played in by Benzema. It was a BBC production with Benzema starting the move, Bale ending it and Cristiano providing the perfect centre. He then tried to score the most audacious of goals for what would have been 4-0. Bale went down the left and crossed and Ronaldo caught the ball perfectly with what can only be described as a 'rabona' volley but Corona made the save. Isco scored a glorious fourth, tip-toeing through the centre of the Cruz Azul defence and shooting past Corona. Ramos was taken off in the second half holding the back of his thigh but Real replaced him with the brilliant Raphael Varane. And in another show of their immense strength in depth two more substitutes, Jese and Sami Khedira, almost combined for the fifth but the German's header hit a post.

"Alex Trebek has become the latest celebrity to get sucked into Sony's ever growing email hack scandal after messages emerged Tuesday of the game show host all but threatening to quit over a Jeopardy Kids episode. Per the emails, the behind the scenes drama began when an 11-year-old little girl ran off the stage after losing in a December episode and ended when producers assented to her mother's demands to reshoot the segment, causing the host of 30 years' ire to flare. 'When I’m vilified, corporate (and certainly legal) always seems to say ‘don’t say anything and it’ll blow over,’ and I’m not feeling support from the producers, and that disappoints the s*** out of me,' Trebek snapped, in an email Radar reports he dictated to an assistant. Scroll down for video . Furious: Alex Trebek all but threatened to quit Jeopardy after a little girl's tantrum over losing out on appearing in Final Jeopardy eventually caused producers to ask him to reshoot the segment . The request to reshoot reportedly came after the contestant was in the red prior to Final Jeopardy and per the rules was unable to finish the game with the other two players. She ran off, according to her mother, because 'she was upset about not being able to completely play the game to the end.' The mother said Trebek, meanwhile, seemed totally uninterested in consoling the girl. 'I don’t think I’ll ever forgive him for that,' the mother told producers. When he was asked to retape, Trebek came about as close as one can to threatening to walk. 'If I’m making mistakes and saying things you don’t like, maybe it’s time for me to move on,' he told 'It’s not a threat, but I want to let you know how I’m feeling.' Now, as Sony's headache grows thanks to an unprecedented email leak, they're likely counting their lucky stars that Trebek didn't take the threat a step further.

The lawsuits seek to gain class-action status on behalf of those employees whose private data, including medical records, have been released by hackers in recent weeks. Two employees sued Sony in federal court on Monday, alleging the company failed to secure its computer systems despite ""weaknesses that it has known about for years,"" and instead made a business decision to accept the risk. It contends that the latest data breaches are especially ""surprising and egregious"" because Sony Pictures has been repeatedly attacked over the years, including a 2011 hack that revealed millions of user accounts on Sony's PlayStation video-game network. On Tuesday, two former movie production workers sued Sony in Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming the company waited too long to notify employees that their data had been stolen. The case filed by Susan Dukow and Yvonne Yaconelli alleges Sony violated California laws meant to protect sensitive financial and medical information. The hack attack against Sony Entertainment is airing the film studio's dirty laundry in public - revealing.

"Nottingham Forest have won a £250,000 transfer fund to spend in the January window, despite being subject to a Football League embargo. Forest supporter Shaun Lander earned his side the prize as Sky Bet's Transfer Fund competition came to an end on Tuesday lunchtime, just over 24 hours after the Football League put Forest, along with Championship rivals Blackburn and Leeds, under an embargo for breaching financial fair play rules. But the League's chief executive Shaun Harvey confirmed that Stuart Pearce's men will still receive the windfall, however it can only be spent on the wages of players signing on a free transfer or on loan. Nottingham Forest have £250,000 to spend in January after receiving an unexpected windfall . But boss Stuart Pearce can only spend it on wages . 'They can use the money in terms of paying loan wages but not transfer fees,' he told Sky Sports News. A shortlist of 10 fans was selected at random from 70,000 customers of the Football League's title sponsors and Lander was announced as the lucky winner in the draw at Wembley - securing his club the bumper prize as well as a £5,000 cheque for himself. The clubs that missed out at the final hurdle were Huddersfield, Fulham, Cardiff, Leeds, Watford, Wigan, Southend and Exeter. Blackburn, Leeds and Forest were given a transfer ban for the January window after breaching the Football League's FFP rules. The League announced that the three clubs all incurred financial losses more than the £8million permitted during last season. Submissions from QPR, Leicester and Burnley - who were all promoted to the Premier League - plus the three clubs relegated last season will now be considered by the Football League. Under the transfer embargoes, the three clubs will be prohibited from signing any new players - either on a permanent or loan deal - unless they have 24 or fewer 'established players', which is described as 24 players aged 21 or over that have made at least five starts for the club.","Nottingham Forest fan won his club £250,000 transfer fund .

"Some of the trophies stolen from Formula One team Red Bull's factory have been found dumped in a lake, it has been revealed. More than 60 trophies were stolen after a gang of six men used a vehicle to ram the front entrance of the team's building in Milton Keynes at around 1.30am on December 6. Thames Valley Police said that around 20 of the prizes were recovered from Horseshoe Lake near Sandhurst Monday after being spotted by a member of the public. Sebastian Vettel poses next to the Red Bull trophy cabinet from which 60 trophies were stolen on December 6 . Red Bull's factory in Milton Keynes was smashed by a silver 4x4 - about 20 trophies were found in a lake . Detective Constable Chris Oakman said: 'We estimate about 20 trophies have been recovered, but we are liaising with Red Bull to establish the exact number, as some of the trophies are damaged.' Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the manner in which some trophies were found showed the disregard the criminals had for the objects stolen. 'It's good news that some of our trophies have been found and thanks to the police for all their help so far,' he said on the Red Bull Racing website. 'The fact that some of the trophies were discarded in a lake and damaged shows how senseless this crime was. 'While the trophies mean an enormous amount to the team, their intrinsic value is low – and the extent of the damage that was caused to the factory by the offenders during the break-in was significant. 'Hopefully we can get the trophies back to our factory where they belong and get replicas made of those that we can't. Thanks to everyone involved for their help so far.' The damage to the factory after the building was ram-raided was clear from the outside . After the robbery, Horner warned fans of the Austrian team which won the F1 constructors' championship and drivers' championship from 2010-2013 would be victims too with access to the site likely to be limited in the future. 'The break-in caused significant damage and was very upsetting for our night officers who were on duty at the time,' Horner said. 'The offenders took items that not only did not belong to them, but which represented the efforts of a group of dedicated, hard-working individuals. 'Beyond the aggressive nature of this break-in, we are perplexed why anyone would take these trophies. The value to the team is of course extraordinarily high due to the sheer hard work and effort that went into winning each and every one. Team principal Christian Horner said the 'break-in caused significant damage' and said it could affect fans . 'But their intrinsic value is low; they would be of little benefit to those outside of the team and, in addition to that, many of the trophies on display were replicas. 'The actions of these men mean it's likely that we will have to make our site less accessible in the future, which will be unfair on the hundreds of fans that travel to visit our factory each year to see our trophies and our Formula One car.'

"Brendan Rodgers insists Liverpool's dressing room is not being undermined by unrest as he urged his squad to revive their ailing season by securing a League Cup semi-final place. The scrutiny on Liverpool has been intensifying on the back of poor results and performances and Rodgers said after the 3-0 defeat by Manchester United that Liverpool needed to rediscover their team ethos. It prompted former Liverpool midfielder Paul Ince to pinpoint Mario Balotelli and he claimed the Italian has been a disruptive influence, ruining the harmony that was in place last season during the club's pursuit of the Barclays Premier League title. Brendan Rodgers arrives at Liverpool's training ground ahead of the League Cup tie at Bournemouth . Raheem Sterling - showing off his new shaved haircut - arrives at Melwood for training . Emre Can drives in to Liverpool's Melwood training complex . Mario Balotelli drives his car into the carpark at Melwood . Lucas Leiva parks up ahead of training at Melwood before the game at Bournemouth . Rodgers, however, has dismissed suggestions that discord in the dressing room is compromising Liverpool's ambitions and he wants to see his squad provide the perfect response by beating Bournemouth to get within touching distance of what would be the club's ninth League Cup triumph. 'Mario has had a problem with his groin that is on going,' said Rodgers when asked if Balotelli would feature against Bournemouth. 'We will assess it. There are lots of opinions about Liverpool. Paul is someone I respect. He has been a manager and knows the pressures. Mario is here and my job is to maximise what I can get out of him and that is what I will concentrate on. Mario Balotelli has been suffering with a groin problem . Reds captain Steven Gerrard looked dejected as they lost 3-0 at Old Trafford at the weekend . 'Our dressing room is very strong. We have got a captain who is a strong leader. I have heard stories about unrest but that is absolutely not true. I believe once we get confidence back, we will be better.' Of the test against Championship leaders Bournemouth, Rodgers added: 'It is going to be a really tough game. It is a challenge that we are up for. We want to win this competition. I saw enough at the weekend to see that things are coming back for us. It would give us confidence. If we can get the victory and get through that will hopefully give us the impetus to go on. 'This is the first competition that you can win so it is a priority. The next game is always the most important.' Paul Ince said that he thought Balotelli had been a disruptive influence - Rodgers denied the claim . December 16 marks five years to the day since Rodgers was sacked by Reading. Liverpool's form has led to the spotlight shining on his position at Anfield but he's not letting the pressure get to him. 'It was unfortunate (what happened at Reading) but it was the making of me as a manager,' said Rodgers. 'It's not until you have experienced it you can become better. I was able to go on and do a decent job a Swansea and I would hope that people have said I have done a decent job here. I have got great confidence in how I work and how my staff work.'

"His bold, ambitious words befitted the city in which they were delivered. On the New York leg of Liverpool’s summer tour, Brendan Rodgers was asked his main aim for the year. ‘I want a trophy this year,’ Rodgers replied without hesitation. ‘I want the club to win big trophies again. The expectancy this season is continual improvement. We want to win. To be successful is winning trophies.’ That statement was given on August 1, when hopes were high and confidence was soaring. Fast forward to December 17 and the picture is dramatically different. There has been no continual improvement, just a litany of disappointment and frustration. Brendan Rodgers arrives at Liverpool's training ground ahead of the League Cup tie at Bournemouth . Raheem Sterling - showing off his new shaved haircut - arrives at Melwood for training . Mario Balotelli drives his car into the car park at Melwood as Liverpool prepare for Bournemouth . Still, though, Rodgers’ dream is alive. Though the two biggest prizes — the Barclays Premier League and Champions League — have disappeared, the Capital One Cup could yet be the competition that turns the tide for Liverpool’s embattled manager. This, after all, is a trophy that has spent more time being polished at Anfield than anywhere else. Liverpool have won the League Cup a record-breaking eight times, most recently in 2012. They have also contested the most finals (11) and semi-finals (14). History, however, is no help to Rodgers in these trying moments. To stand a chance of stopping the rot that has set in, Liverpool will need to quarry into their reserves of resilience and find a way of negotiating another night that is littered with pitfalls. Bournemouth, leaders of the Sky Bet Championship, versus struggling Liverpool under floodlights in a tight stadium has ‘upset’ written all over it. If that were to happen, if another ray of light were snuffed out, the damage it would cause to a campaign would be huge. Liverpool dare not lose. Mario Balotelli is enduring a nightmare start to his career at Liverpool following a £16m move . The Italian striker fluffed his lines in front of goal yet again in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester United on Sunday . ‘We want to win this competition,’ Rodgers said. ‘It is the first trophy (of the season) you can win, so it is a priority. If we can get the victory and get through, hopefully that will give us the impetus to go on. It’s going to be really tough but it is a challenge we are up for.’ Rodgers set the right tone at Melwood. From the moment he walked into the media room, dressed in club tracksuit, there was no sense he was stewing on the results that have torpedoed his side’s ambitions. But words are meaningless unless they are backed up with performances and Rodgers, who admitted at Old Trafford that Liverpool had lost their ‘team ethos’, will need no reminding that critics will be studying every move of his players, looking for cracks. Reds captain Steven Gerrard looked dejected after his side's 3-0 loss at Old Trafford on Sunday . ‘It’s not a distraction,’ said Rodgers, batting away the perception of problems in the dressing room ‘I know the players I have. They are a wonderful group, honest. Some are still adapting to being at Liverpool, which is very difficult. ‘The spirit is strong, you saw (against Manchester United) at the weekend the work the players put in. It is not rocket science, for people to look and analyse why we’re not what we were last season. ‘We have world-class players missing from our group. We’ve been inconsistent and we have got many more games this season. We are adapting to the challenges this year and learning. As the season goes on, we will get stronger and stronger.’ Glen Jonhson will miss the clash with Bournemouth after pulling up against in the loss to Manchester United .

Mario Balotelli — whose FA hearing into a misconduct charge will be held on Thursday — misses the Bournemouth game with a groin problem and Glen Johnson is sidelined after pulling up on Sunday, so Rodgers will change his starting line-up for the 27th game in a row. ‘The reality is we haven’t scored enough goals or been enough of a creative threat,’ Rodgers acknowledged. ‘I’m not going to persevere with a system that has not been creative for us.’ Raheem Sterling will be trusted to convert Liverpool’s chances at Bournemouth. Unnecessary scrutiny on his contract has been created — Bayern Munich are the latest side he has been linked with — but Rodgers is calm, and said: ‘I don’t think there’s anything affecting him. He leaves his representatives to work with the club to hopefully organise a deal.","The Barclays Premier League and Champions League are no longer targets for Brendan Rodgers' side .

And Palace are ready to revive their interest in the former England star who won 107 caps. Cole’s position at Roma is unclear after being dropped from the starting line-up for the last five matches. Cole’s struggles in Rome have reignited Palace’s interest but there are numerous hurdles to overcome before any move materialises - namely persuading Roma into a deal and the issue of wages. Cole takes on Sergio Aguero during Roma's Champions League clash against Man City earlier this season . Inclusive of bonuses, Cole earns up to £80,000 per week in Italy, while Palace’s wage ceiling is about £40,000 per week. If Palace strike a deal, Cole would be making a romantic return to Selhurst Park.

"League One Sheffield United produced another major cup upset on a feisty night that ended with Southampton manager Ronald Koeman refusing to shake the hand of his victorious rival Nigel Clough. Marc McNulty's scrappy second-half winner – following an error from England goalkeeper Fraser Forster – took the Blades into their second consecutive major cup semi-final following their run in last season's FA Cup. It was accompanied by a constant roar from the Bramall Lane faithful and the animated presence on the touchline of Clough and his assistant, former Blades skipper Chris Morgan. Sheffield United's Scottish striker Marc McNulty celebrates after putting his side 1-0 up . McNulty pounces to send the ball towards goal as Fraser Forster desperately tries to stop it .

Subs not used: Davis, Yoshida,  Reed . Sent off: Gardos . Booked: Mane, Clyne, Wanyama, Schneiderlin, Fonte . Referee: Michael Oliver 6.5 . MOTM: Harris . Attendance: 21,906 . Morgan was sent to the stands after United's goal for making one comment too many and afterwards Koeman blanked Clough's offer to shake hands. 'I only shake hands with people who have respect for me as a coach, who have respect for the fourth official,' said the clearly cheesed off Dutchman. 'The behaviour of the bench of Sheffield United, I have never seen that (before). That was the reason I didn't shake hands.' Nigel's father Brian wouldn't have been happy at any alleged haranguing of fourth official Paul Tierney or any other official but he would have been delighted by the effort and commitment shown by the underdogs. Even though Southampton had lost their last four games and were without suspended top scorer Graziano Pelle, they do stand fifth in the Premier League and were hot favourites after Koeman named a strong team with regulars Nathaniel Clyne, Ryan Bertrand and Victor Wanyama included, and Morgan Schneiderlin making a welcome return from injury. But United just didn't let them settle from the first whistle to the last, so much so that even Koeman didn't have any complaint about the final outcome. 'We hit the ball too long, we didn't play our normal football and to give them credit, they made it difficult for us,' he said. After an opening 45 minutes that saw 19 fouls committed without a single shot on target being registered, the home side – who beat West Ham earlier in the competition – stepped up a gear.

Southampton's Mane (centre) holds off the challenge from Sheffield United's Louis Reed . Southampton’s first shot on target in the match didn’t arrive until the 70th minute. They had eight attempts off target before then. Forster made fantastic saves to keep out Jamie Murphy and Michael Doyle but then became a culprit as Sheffield took the lead after 63 minutes. A free-kick by Bob Harris was fumbled by the Saints goalkeeper and from a couple of yards, McNulty beat a posse of players from both sides to get their first and squeeze the ball over the line. The Scot, signed from Livingston in the summer, couldn't stop smiling and said: 'It was a striker's goal, a poach inside the box.' Clough was also delighted. His side, fifth in League One, have now beaten four Premier League clubs in 2014. His half-time substitute Che Adams was playing non-league football for Ilkeston a few weeks ago. 'The only disappointment was we didn't win by more,' said Clough. 'That's the story, I don't think a sentence should be written about the managers,' he said rather irritatedly when the subject of the non-handshake came up. The real surprise was that Southampton failed to pepper the United goal when they had 27 minutes to save the tie. Instead, the home side seemed likelier to score and Southampton's misery was compounded at the start of four minutes' injury-time when Florin Gardos was shown the red card for fouling McNulty as he threatened to break away and make it 2-0.

Southampton players gather for a huddle ahead of the Capital One Cup quarter-final at Bramall Lane . A chastened Koeman admitted: 'It's cup football and it's not about the level. They showed the best cup experience. It's not the first time and it's not the last time a League One club will beat a Premier League. That's football.' Clough pointed out afterwards his side were forced to field a right-winger Ryan Flynn at right-back against a team of internationals. 'It is an incredible night for the club,' he said. 'I thought we deserved the victory, we created more chances and the only disappointment was that we should have had another goal. 'Whoever we get in the semi-final will be a special occasion, but nights like tonight stay in the memory for a long time.' As a player with Nottingham Forest when his dad Brian was the manager, Nigel won the League Cup twice in 1989 and 1990.

"Self sufficient: Five turbines (stock image pictured) on El Hierro will have an output of 11.5 megawatts - enough power for the island's 10,000 residents . Self-sufficiency is a dream for many environmentally-minded people who would like to generate their own electricity. And now a whole island is set to become the world’s first land mass to be fully self-sufficient - by generating its own water and wind power. A wind farm will open at the end of June on El Hierro - the smallest of Spain’s Canary Islands. With its steep cliffs and mountains, this location is perfectly positioned to harvest gusts of wind off the Atlantic coast of Africa. Its five turbines installed at the north eastern tip of El Hierro, near the capital Valverde, will have a total output of 11.5 megawatts. This is enough power to meet the demand of the island's 10,000 residents, as well as its water desalination plants. Although other islands around the world are powered by solar or wind energy, experts say El Hierro is the first to secure a constant supply of electricity by combining wind and water power - and with no connection to any outside electricity network. Surplus power from the wind turbines will be used to pump fresh water from a reservoir near the harbour to a larger one at volcanic crater located approximately 2,300ft (700m) above sea level. When there is little or no wind, the water will be channelled down to the lower reservoir through turbines to generate electricity. ‘This system guarantees us a supply of electricity,’ said the director of the Gorona del Viento wind power plant, Juan Manuel Quintero, who is supervising final tests before the plant starts functioning in a few weeks. A world first: El Hierro is set to become the world's first island to be be fully self-sufficient by generating its own water and wind power.

The plant will meet half of the island's . electricity demand when it is officially inaugurated at the end of June - . and that figure will rise to 100 per cent over the following months. The scheme will cut 18,700 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year and eliminate the island's annual consumption of 40,000 barrels of oil. However, El Hierro will maintain its fuel oil power station as a backup. The island is cited as a pioneering project by IRENA, the international organisation for renewable energy. Alain Gioda, a climate historian at France IRD science research institute told AFP: ‘The true novelty of El Hierro is that technicians have managed, without being connected to any national network, to guarantee a stable production of electricity, that comes 100 per cent from renewable energy, overcoming the intermittent nature of the wind.’ El Hierro's wind power plant has sparked interest from other islands seeking to follow its example. Officials from Aruba, Hawaii, Samso in Denmark, Oki in Japan, and Indonesia have all shown interest. Alpidio . Armas, the president of island's local council, said: ‘It is a project . which is considered at the world level as a pioneer and it is one of the . most important in the production of renewable energy’. The . island plans to boost its environmental credentials further by ensuring . that by 2020 all of its 6,000 vehicles are run on electricity, based on . an agreement with the Renault-Nissan alliance. Going it alone: Although other islands around the world are powered by solar or wind energy, experts say El Hierro (marked) is the first to secure a constant supply of electricity by combining wind and water power and with no connection to any outside electricity network. the island is the smallest of the Canary Islands . The wind power plant cost €80million euros (£66million or $110million) to build. The island authorities own 60 per cent of the plant, with 30 per cent held by Spanish energy company Endesa and 10 per cent by a local technology institute. Armos continued: ‘We wanted to be the owners of the majority of the plant. That means that the profits as well as the possible losses, that is the destiny of Gorona del Viento, is the responsibility of the residents of the island.’ He predicts that revenues from the plant will boost the island's budget by about €1million to €3million per year. ‘These are revenues that can go to the local residents, to subsidise water prices, infrastructure, social policies.’ The island is already designated a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, as 60 per cent of the land -  around 107 square miles (278 square kilometres) is protected to preserve natural diversity.","Wind farm will open in June on El Hierro - the smallest of Spain’s Canary Islands - which will harvest wind off the Atlantic coast of Africa .

"David Moyes has admitted he wants to bring in several loan reinforcements at Real Sociedad in January increasing the chances of Adnan Januzaj moving to Spain in the winter transfer window. Asked about likely first signings as Real Sociedad coach Moyes said: 'The president has been very good with me and he is going to let me see what I can do. My intention is maybe going into the loan market to bring in a couple of players on loan. If I can boost the squad and give everybody a lift then I will try to do that.' Moyes brought Januzaj through at Old Trafford and with the Belgian international out of favour under Louis van Gaal a move could suit all parties. Adnan Januzaj could be reunited with David Moyes when the transfer window re-opens in January . Januzaj has made 11 appearances for United this season... but could be allowed to leave for Spain . 'January is never the best time but if there are boys who could come here and help the team and we can have a look at them for six months then we'll do that,' he said after Sunday's draw with Athletic Bilbao. A central midfielder and a striker will also be on the former United manager's wanted list. Carlos Vela has already scored four goals for his new manager but alongside him 7.5m euros club record signing Alfred Finnbogason is yet to come any where close to justifying his fee. Moyes said: 'I have told him that sometimes the goals are the last thing to come. Everybody wants it to be the first thing but the first thing has to be what you do for the team. Hard workers are always respected. Vela was exceptional against Athletic Bilbao and we had to try to get the ball to him more in the second and we couldn't.' Moyes is looking to add to his Real Sociedad squad in the new year . The Scot says British clubs would benefit from a winter break after the FA Cup third round matches . Real Sociedad play a second leg Spanish cup last-16 match on Wednesday at home to third tier side Oviedo. The teams drew 0-0 in the first leg. Moyes then takes his team to play Levante at the weekend and will then experience his first winter break. 'I have always been an advocate of it,' he said. 'If you play in the Premier League then you have to accept that football is played over the Christmas and New Year period but I think we should have a break after the first game in January, after the FA Cup. 'That's when people have the least amount of cash in their pocket and when the players have just made a huge effort over Christmas so I have always thought that two weeks then would be ideal for British clubs. 'It is a different scenario here. It will be the first Christmas I have had with my family I although I imagine I'll probably end up watching a game somewhere on Boxing Day.'

"A team at Osaka Prefecture University in Japan has developed technology that could allow people to control their mobiles with their tongue . In the world of smartphones and tablets, a wealth of knowledge is constantly available at your fingertips. But what happens when your fingers are needed elsewhere? Scientists in Japan believe they have the answer - use your tongue instead. A team at Osaka Prefecture University in Japan has developed a device that controls gadgets by sensing tongue pressure through the cheek. This then activates various functions on a smartphone, depending on what type of movement the tongue has made. The aim is to enable people to have access to their personal devices in situations that require them to be hands-free. It can, for instance, be used by skiers and motorcyclists when they want to activate apps on their mobile devices. ‘The tongue is a well-developed muscle capable of fine-grain movements - so we thought it should be good for control interactions,’ team member Kai Kunze told New Scientist.

"Click here for all the big match stats from our brilliant Match Zone service . Briefly we had the whiff of a comeback. As the rain fell in Derby, Steve McClaren’s progressive Championship side, two down and seemingly finished, had just pulled a goal back on Chelsea seemingly out of nowhere. As is always the case in such situations, momentum had switched at a stroke. Derby found energy, Chelsea only uncertainty. And then, a long ball forwards from the Chelsea half prompted a race between a fresh visiting substitute with a point to prove and a 29-year-old Derby defender who had spent much of the previous 80 minutes locked in sapping combat with Didier Drogba. Eden Hazard strikes to give Chelsea the lead in the Blues' Capital One Cup quarter-final clash against Derby at the iPro Stadium .

Ratings by Ian Ladyman at the iPro Stadium . There was perhaps only like to be one winner and as Loic Remy and Jake Buxton hustled for the ball, arms inevitably became entwined and both tumbled to the floor. The inevitable question was: Who grabbed who first? Replays showed that Remy may have been guilty while another argument suggested Buxton had been the initial offender, placing his arm across his opponent. Whatever the case, Buxton was adjudged guilty by a linesman and walked the long walk. Moments later Chelsea – a man to the good and back in control of their own nerves – scored a decisive third goal and a place in the last four of one of Jose Mourinho’s favourite competitions was theirs. Certainly it was controversial and it may have robbed us of some late intrigue. The lesson here for defenders, though, is that in these situations, they always have the most to lose. Better perhaps to avoid the flailing arms, the tangling limbs, and put your faith in your own turn of foot. Failing that, perhaps, just close your eyes and hope the centre forward misses. Here, it was an unfortunate end to what had been a gripping game. Chelsea had started slowly but had, for the middle hour, been imperious. The manner in which they have responded to their recent Barclays Premier League defeat at Newcastle has been impressive and only a brave man would put money on Stoke as Chelsea head west along the A50 from here to begin their Christmas and New Year’s programme next Monday night. Derby, though, are a capable team. They looked sporadically dangerous with the ball and deserved to be in the contest until the death. Ultimately, perhaps, Chelsea’s greater quality in the final third made a greater difference than the late linesman’s flag. Initially, Derby were impressive, quick, sharp and mobile. By some distance, their best player was the young Englishman Will Hughes. Impossible to miss given his peroxide blond hair, Hughes is easy on the eye as a footballer, possessing a neat touch and a decent first yard of acceleration. Here, he troubled Chelsea for a while but was too often let down by team-mates not on the same wavelength.

Buxton pleads his innonence as referee Jonathan Moss brandishes the red card and gives the Derby defender his marching orders . At times, Hughes wanted it short and it went long. On other occasions, the pass in to his feet was a fraction off. These things can make a difference. And so it was that Chelsea reached the midway point of the first half having conceded ground and possession but no real chances. They then sprang forward to score with their first real attack of note and sadly the goal had its root in a dreadful mistake. Captain Richard Keogh played an unfortunate part in the build up to the Bobby Zamora goal that sunk Derby in last season’s play-off final and he erred again here, conceding the ball unnecessarily to Cesc Fabregas on the corner of his own penalty area. There was still much to do for Chelsea but good teams don’t need asking twice and when Fabregas fed the ball inside to Eden Hazard the Belgian twisted to his right to create a better angle and shot low past Lee Grant in the Derby goal. It was a real blow for Derby simply because Chelsea hadn’t looked like creating much until that point. For the next ten minutes, however, Mourinho’s team suddenly looked capable of closing out the game quickly. Another chance arrived for Hazard – the shot was dragged across goal – before left-back Felipe Luis hammered a drive straight at Grant. Derby reached the interval without further setback, though, while Chelsea lost defender Kurt Zouma to a head injury suffered while defending a corner. Whether that shook Mourinho’s players we don’t know but Hughes spurned the opportunity to punish a slow start by the visitors to the second half when he drove a low shot at Petr Cech following good work from Johnny Russell down the right.

"London Broncos' relegation from the First Utility Super League ends an unbroken 19-year stay in the top flight, but comes as little surprise. Installed as clear favourites to drop into the Kingstone Press Championship back in February, the Broncos' fate was confirmed on Sunday when they lost 72-12 at Warrington. It extended their record losing run to 20 matches and left them 15 points adrift of safety with seven matches left of the regular season. Dejected: The Broncos players have been up against it all season and relegation was confirmed on Sunday . The London club were one six ever-presents in the top flight since the advent of Super League and the switch to summer rugby in 1996. They include Bradford, who could lose their top-flight status next Sunday pending the outcome of their High-Court bid for the re-instatement of the six points they were docked for going into administration earlier this year. The Broncos, formed as Fulham in 1980, endured a yo-yo existence up to being given special status when the big switch came 19 years ago and they justified their inclusion by finishing as runners-up to champions Bradford in 1997. They were one of the few British successes in the ill-fated 1997 World Club Championship, famously beating Mal Meninga's Canberra Raiders in front of a packed house at the The Stoop, and reached the Challenge Cup final in 1999, when Richard Branson led the team out at Wembley in jeans and open-top shirt. Back in the day: Richard Branson led the Broncos out for the Challenge Cup final in 1999 . However, when Branson eventually withdrew his Virgin backing, it signalled a decline which gradually turned into a downward spiral as the club lurched from one crisis to another. Despite the heavy financial commitment of London-based businessman David Hughes, the crowds diminished as the club continued its nomadic trail around the capital and, despite brief forays into the play-offs in 2003 and 2005, they generally hovered near the foot of the table. Only late surges spared them the wooden spoon in each of the last two seasons, but the writing was on the wall at the end of 2013 when the club found itself on the brink once more following their departure from The Stoop. Head coach Tony Rea, who has been connected with the club in various roles since before the advent of Super League, reckoned it ""died five times"" before being thrown a lifeline by Barnet owner Tony Kleanthous, but it was a threadbare team that made the move to The Hive. Decline: Since Branson and Virgin removed their backing the Broncos have struggled to stay afloat . Rea was still putting a new-look squad together when the season kicked off and it was no surprise when he made way in May for the promotion of his assistant Joey Grima. The move came too late for Grima to prevent the inevitable and for the last two months he has been preparing the way for a new start in the Championship, with a raft of new signings and the appointment of an assistant coach. It promises to be a difficult route back to the top flight, but Grima is up for the fight.","Broncos had been in the top flight for 19 years .

"After five days featuring 58 catwalk shows, 57 models, an array of celebrity-saturated front rows and gallons of champagne, London's most fashionable week draws to a close today. And as the dust settles, trends begin to emerge. According to some of LFW's most influential designers - including Erdem, Tom Ford, Christopher Kane and Burberry's Christopher Bailey  - it appears that next season's most stylish accessories are... your nipples. Bare-all: Models at the Christopher Kane SS15 show proved that less is more . Sheer blouses, dresses and shirts have been all over the SS15 catwalks.

However, at Christopher Kane and Erdem, daring see-through designs gave the models nothing to hide behind. Nearly naked: Models at Tom Ford covered up with sequin detailing . Bra-less is the new black: Model at Christopher Kane (left) and at Bora Aksu (right) display a Gothic take on the trend . Surprisingly elegant: Zeynep Kartal displayed barely-there ball gowns on the SS15 catwalk . The fashion for exposed breasts comes hot on the heels of the Free the Nipple campaign. The 'Free the Nipple' campaign is an equality movement that uses social media and film to fight against censorship laws in the US, where it is illegal in 37 states for women to appear topless. It has gained the support of celebrities including Rumer and Scout Willis, Cara Delevingne and Rihanna.

"Thierry Henry has announced his retirement from football following a stellar 18-year career in the game and will take up a role as a Sky Sports pundit. The 37-year-old scored an impressive 360 goals in 792 games for Monaco, Juventus, Arsenal, Barcelona and New York Red Bulls, as well as netting 51 times in 123 caps for France. A good proportion of those goals were truly brilliant and here, Sportsmail has narrowed it down to the top-10 Henry strikes. Enjoy... Thierry Henry was Arsenal's leading scorer with 228 goals, 175 of those in the Premier League . Henry has been confirmed as a full-time pundit for Sky Sports after retiring from football . 10) Real Madrid 0-1 ARSENAL (Champions League round of 16, 21/02/06) This goal is in the list as much for its importance as for the actual quality of the strike itself. During Arsenal's run to the Champions League final in 2005-06, Henry inspired a 1-0 first-leg victory over Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in the last 16. Picking the ball up in the middle of the pitch from Cesc Fabregas, Henry flicked it past the Real defenders before placing the ball expertly past Iker Casillas. One of Arsenal's most famous victories - and it was almost single-handedly achieved by the superb solo goal from the Frenchman. Video courtesy of ITV and the UEFA Champions League. Henry scored a belter against Real Madrid to send Arsenal through to the quarter-final of Champions League . The Frenchman runs off in celebration after netting at the Bernabeu in February 2006 . 9) FRANCE 3-1 Tunisia (International friendly, 14/10/08) Arguably the best of Henry's 51 goals for his national side. With France trailing 1-0 at the Stade de France, Henry picked the ball up in his own half, sprinted towards the Tunisian box and then played a one-two with Yoann Gourcuff. He then placed a majestic shot out of the reach of the goalkeeper and into the back of the net to equalise for Les Bleus. Video courtesy of  the French Football Federation. Henry scored 51 goals for France and won the World Cup and the European Championship . 8) BARCELONA 6-1 Atletico Madrid (La Liga, 04/10/08) Barca may have been storming away with this match, already comfortably 5-1 up, but Henry's contribution to the scoreline was still brilliant. Neat tiki-taka style interplay between Henry, Xavi and Bojan Krkic eventually saw the ball land in front of Henry, who then arrowed a shot into the bottom left-hand corner of the net. Precise football, precise finish. Simply class. Video courtesy of La Liga. The Frenchman also enjoyed a spell at La Liga giants Barcelona after leaving Arsenal . 7) NEW YORK RED BULLS 5-2 Chicago Fire (MLS, 27/10/13) A New York Red Bulls counter attack saw Henry received a chipped pass, facing away from goal, 30 yards out. The forward chested the ball, let it bounce once before unleashing an unstoppable right-foot half-volley into the top right-hand corner of the net. Chicago Fire's goalkeeper could only watch, rooted to the spot, such was the ferocity of the shot. Video courtesy of MSG and the MLS. Henry finished his career by playing for the New York Red Bulls in Major League Soccer in America . 6) ARSENAL 4-2 Liverpool (Premier League, 09/04/04) Like so many of his goals, this oneinvolved a memorable dribble through the very heart of the opposition defence. Henry, advancing from 50 yards out, headed straight past Liverpool's Dietmar Hamann and left him on his backside, before utterly dumbfounding Jamie Carragher with his dancing feet. The trickery allowed Henry to head to the edge of the six-yard box before placing the ball into the back of the net. Video courtesy of the Premier League. Henry (right) battles for the ball with Jamie Carragher during Arsenal's 4-2 win over Liverpool in 2004 . The Frenchman runs off in celebration after netting a wondergoal against Liverpool . 5) ARSENAL 3-0 Tottenham Hotspur (Premier League, 16/11/02) How many players can say they have run more than 80 yards with the ball before scoring in such an important Premier League match as the north London derby? Well, Thierry Henry is one. He left the Spurs midfield for dead, before bamboozling Stephen Carr and Ledley King and then firing a left-footed shot into the bottom corner to send the Gunners on their way to a memorable 3-0 victory. Video courtesy of the Premier League. Henry is overjoyed having netted a stunning solo goal in the north London derby with Tottenham Hotspur . The Frenchman strikes the ball with his left foot having run a long way with the ball from his own half . 4) West Ham United 2-2 ARSENAL (Premier League, 24/08/02) With West Ham United 2-0 up at Upton Park, Arsenal finally decided to start playing the football they were capable of. After some loving quick passing in the middle of the pitch, the ball was passed to Henry's feet who, although turning away from goal, flicked the ball around the defender. He took a touch on his knee, then caught a shot on the half-volley from 22 yards which rocketed into the far corner of the net. Video courtesy of the Premier League. West Ham United were also one of the many sides who were subjected to a Thierry Henry special . 3) ARSENAL 4-0 Charlton Athletic (Premier League, 02/10/04) This is the goal many Premier League fans associate Henry with. Cheeky, audacious and brilliant. Henry received the ball with his back to goal on the edge of the six-yard box and, while showing great strength to hold off Charlton Athletic defender Jonathan Fortune, Henry controlled the ball and then backheel nut-megged the centre half. The ball went past the keeper and into the far corner. An exquisite goal. Video courtesy of the Premier League. Henry backheels the ball between the legs of Charlton Athletic centre back Jonathan Fortune . The goal was cheeky, audacious and magnificent and basically sums Henry up . 2) SC Weiz 0-5 ARSENAL (Pre-season friendly, 20/0705) In a pre-season friendly in 2005 against Austrian side SC Weiz, Philippe Senderos played a long ball forward to Henry. The Frenchman took a touch on his knee, flicked the ball over his own head and that of the defender, before placing a lobbed shot into the left-hand corner of the net from the edge of the area. Probably a goal most football fans will not have seen before, but certainly one to remember.

"It is the harrowing certificate that shows how 16-month-old John Desmond Dolan was described as being a ‘congenital idiot’ at the time of his death in St Mary’s Mother and Baby home. John is one of the 796 children whose remains were left in a mass grave on the grounds of St Mary’s, which was run by the Sisters of Bon Secours. Documents given to the Irish Mail on Sunday by the boy’s sister reveal how he had a healthy birth and weighed 8lbs 9oz when he was born at the Tuam home on February 22, 1946. Harrowing: The death certificate of 16-month-old John Desmond Dolan, who died in 1947 . His mother Bridget Dolan, a farmer's daughter from Clonfert, Co. Galway, gave birth to him in the presence of a woman known as Bina Rabbitte. There are no details given of his father. Records from the home show how a health inspection was carried out in April 1947 by a man known as Mr Humphreys. Tragic: Bridget Dolan, whose sons died at the mother and baby home . Despite being born a healthy baby, a year later John was described as a 'miserable emaciated child with a voracious appetite and no control over his bodily functions'. Doctors referred to John as 'probably mental defective'. That year there was an outbreak of measles in the home, which John contracted. He died on June 11, 1947. On his death certificate it showed how Ms Rabbitte was again present at the time of John's death. It is understood she had been born in the home and remained on, assisting the nuns with the children. John's cause of death was recorded as 'congential idiot and measles'. His sister said: 'He was born healthy and yet he died less than two years later. What is a congenital idiot? How could anyone call a child that? 'He is on that death list and it’s terrible what happened to him. To think that report says he was a miserable 16-month-old is heartbreaking.' In the home, mothers looked after their own children. John’s mother Bridget was discharged from the home in the February before her son died after the nuns found her a job as a housekeeper. Three years later she fell pregnant again and her second child, William Joseph, who was born at Galway University Hospital on May 21, 1950. He was born a healthy baby and there are no records of his having any illnesses. Heis registered in the Tuam home as having died on February 3, 1951, yet there are no notesregarding cause of death and no records of his death among the national death registrations. His sister has reported William Joseph missing to gardaí: 'I don't know where he is. I heard talk through his family that he was sent to America,' she said. And on Friday, the MoS has learned, the family made a formal requested to gardai that they find, exhume and return the body of John for a proper burial. John is one of the 796 children whose remains were left in a mass grave on the grounds of St Mary's .","16-month-old John Desmond Dolan died in St Mary's Mother and Baby Home on June 11, 1947 .

"US goalkeepers Tim Howard and Brad Friedel have ended their feud over claims made in the former's book. Veteran Tottenham shot-stopper Friedel was accused in his fellow American's book The Keeper of looking to prevent Howard's move to Manchester United going through in 2003, a claim he labelled 'ludicrous'. Howard, now with Everton, accepts his fellow goalkeeper's version of events and future print runs of the book will be amended to reflect this. Tim Howard has accepted Brad Friedel's version of events about a move falling through with Man United . Veteran Tottenham keeper Friedel said claims he sabotaged Howard's move were 'ludicrous' The disagreement stemmed from a letter of recommendation Howard asked Friedel, then playing for Blackburn, to sign on his behalf as he attempted to secure a work permit for his move from the New York/New Jersey Metrostars. Friedel felt the letter contained numerous inaccuracies that he was not prepared to put his name to - but disputed the assertion that he then wrote to the Professional Footballers' Association opposing Howard's move. Howard posted a statement on his Twitter feed on Tuesday evening in an attempt to bury the hatchet. Howard, claim a corner against QPR on Monday, will amend future editions of his book The Keeper . Friedel says he didn't sign a letter of recommendation for Howard as it contained a number of inaccuracies . It read: 'In telling the story of my move to Manchester United from MLS, I describe at length a number of obstacles that potentially stood in the way of a massive career-changing opportunity. One of many such obstacles that I discuss in this context is opposition to my work permit by the PFA and, as I understood at the time, Brad Friedel. 'Brad takes issue with my characterisation of his position and (the) events. At the time, I was surprised that Brad would not automatically sign my letter of recommendation, and I took this as an opposition to my application. Brad later explained that he had not in fact opposed my efforts to seek a work permit, either by writing to the PFA or otherwise. 'I have decided to take Brad at his word. Accordingly, I have directed my publisher to amend future copies of my book by striking reference to Brad's opposition.' Friedel, now with Tottenham, then reposted the statement, adding: 'Glad it's over, happy to move on.' In the original book, Howard wrote: 'The legal team at Manchester United ... told me that Brad hadn't merely refused to sign a statement on my behalf, he had actively tried to block my transfer. He'd written to the appeals committee suggesting that I shouldn't be given a work permit at all.' Howard and Friedel embrace after a Premier League  game between Everton and Aston Villa in 2009 . Friedel responded to ESPN FC on December 4: 'I never sabotaged, and I never stood in the way of Tim Howard getting a work permit. This is ludicrous. '(The letter) was sent to me, and the only thing that was true on it was my name. The letter was full of exaggerations that the people on the PFA and appeals committee would have seen through. 'It said that I had been in direct competition with Tim Howard for the starting job on the US national team for the last two years, when anyone who follows (US) soccer knew it was between Kasey (Keller) and I. 'Yes, I refused to sign that. We got the letter and said ""We have to change this, because this isn't true."" We made our changes and sent it back. They didn't like what I was going to sign, so they didn't use it. And that was the end of the matter.'","Tim Howard accepted Brad Friedel's version of story in The Keeper .

"The grace of Roger Federer, the power of Serena Williams, the pained determination of Andy Murray — all broadcast free to Wimbledon’s legion of armchair fans. In an ideal world the All England Club would like it to stay that way, which is why they moved quickly on Tuesday to scotch suggestions that any move towards subscription channels was imminent. Responding to a report that there had been talks between the BBC and BT Sport about possibly sharing coverage, a Wimbledon spokesman said that they were committed to their near 80-year broadcasting partner. TV presenter Sue Barker hosts the BBC's coverage at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships . Recently the BBC has had to cut or share its broadcasting rights for many live sporting events. LOST . SHARED . The ‘crown jewel’ events that must be shown on free-to-air TV: Olympics; football World Cup and Euros; FA Cup final; Scottish FA Cup final; The Grand National; The Derby; Wimbledon finals; Rugby World Cup final; Rugby League Challenge Cup final. ‘There has definitely not been contact with BT,’ he said. The Beeb never comment on rights negotiations and, in any event, their deal to cover Britain’s Grand Slam event runs for another three years. The good news for the millions who look forward to watching the summer fortnight of tennis without having to pay anything beyond the licence fee is that no drastic change will happen in the short-to-medium term. However, the media landscape is being reshaped so rapidly, and such are the questions hanging over the future budgets available to the public service broadcaster, that the status quo may not last forever. The BBC has been around at Wimbledon almost as long as the Centre Court, having started in 1937 with brief flashes of coverage growing to the enormous and slick operation that now hits the screens for two weeks every year. Ties between the two institutions run deep and, ever pragmatic, the All England Club, which hosts Wimbledon, continues to recognise the power of terrestrial television. Lewis Hamilton’s triumph over Rory McIlroy in the Sports Personality of the Year, for example, was arguably partly down to the driver’s feats being screened for free far more often than those of the golfer. But however much Wimbledon’s fondness for the BBC is reciprocated, the corporation is living in more straitened times, and with budgets limited there may come the time when the appeal of sharing costs with a wealthy partner proves irresistible. Andy Murray with the Wimbledon trophy after winning the Championships in July 2013 . A BBC cameraman records the tennis action on Centre Court at the All England Club in 1999 . Such arrangements are already in place with Sky over Formula One coverage, and something similar exists when it comes to the FA Cup. Of course the nature of a short Grand Slam is different, and in tennis specific terms it is more instructive to look at the new deal that began this year for coverage in France of the French Open. Roland Garros is covered in its first week exclusively from 11am to 3pm by Eurosport. Then France Televisions, the equivalent of the BBC, joins in, so if you want to watch the day’s play in full you have to sign up to a package that includes its broadcast partner. In time it is conceivable that this could happen at Wimbledon. The decision on who broadcasts The Championships is Wimbledon’s, although the finals weekend is considered one of the nation’s sporting ‘crown jewels’ that must be shown free to air. The BBC television edit suite showing all the courts during the 2011 Wimbledon Championships . And 90 per cent of tournament profits go to the LTA for the growth of the sport, so there are no shareholders baying for absolute profit. The All England Club need to make substantial amounts to pay for its latest phase of development, although this will be covered by the event’s remarkable commercial success. Among the contributory factors to that is the 12-year-deal with American broadcasters ESPN that started in 2012, reputedly worth £300million. It is notable that when the decision to drop co-hosts NBC was announced, All England Chairman Philip Brook stated that a major attraction was having one broadcaster covering the whole thing. Yet with the world changing so fast, nothing can guarantee there will not end up being a third party in this longest of marriages between Wimbledon and the BBC.","Wimbledon said on Tuesday that there had been no contact with BT Sport .

"Yeovil scored two late goals to finally finish off Accrington Stanley and set up a dream FA Cup third round tie against Manchester United.

It was clear what progression meant to both sides when the closest chance for either side in the first half was gifted by their opponents. Accrington Stanley's Tom Aldred was inches away from scoring a calamitous own goal after 12 minutes. The defender raced back towards goal to chase a long pass through and nodded the ball back to Rose, not realising his team-mate had hurtled from goal to intercept. The header wrong-footed Rose and beat the desperate Aldred to the line, only to trickle past the left post. Then just before the half-hour mark Brendan Moloney, brought in at the last minute to Yeovil's line-up after Jordan Clarke pulled out in the warm-up, under-hit a back pass to his goalkeeper, which let Accrington Stanley striker Marcus Carver in. But Yeovil stopper Jed Steer managed to steer the player wide and tip the ball off the pitch for a corner. The home side had more of the ball and should have taken the lead. Midfielder Joseph Edwards ran through on goal in the 30th minute and had two team-mates waiting in the middle for a ball across and a simple finish. Edwards went for goal instead and struck a shot straight at Rose. Yeovil continued to press and Gillett let a throw-in from the left run across his body then hit a drive towards the far right goal, only for the ball to sail narrowly past the right post with Rose beaten.

Yeovil are set to earn in the region of £50,000 inn gate receipts with the United tie almost certain to be sold out at Yeovil’s 9,565-seater stadium. Yeovil would be set to earn a staggering £1.5m from the third round tie if they can force a replay at old Trafford. The towering Tom Eaves – standing at 6ft 5ins tall – had two similar chances inside the box on the left-hand side, but he hit both hard and wide of the near post. Heavy rain which begun falling just before kick off continued to beat down turning the second half more to chance with players slipping and sliding. Shirts and shorts turned brown with mud as the two teams battled, knowing what was at stake. Yeovil pressed on and in the 53rd minute Gillett twisted and turned and got off a shot inside the box, as he slid, which was again close. Bu five minutes later at the other end a ball was swung into Yeovil's box which caused chaos, allowing Andy Proctor to get a shot away from eight yards but he fired over. The added pressure on both teams – that thought of facing Manchester United in the next round – weighed heavy and was felt in every slightly over-hit shot. Every chance on goal and defensive slip was a hero and villain waiting to happen. Yeovil's Sam Foley had plenty of time to judge his shot as the ball dropped from a height but the ball went over. At the other end Seamus McCarten made a strong run through the middle but his shot forced a top save from Steer. McCarten then hit the bar with a 20-yard shot, which came back out to Matt Crooks and with goalkeeper on the floor and only two yards out he headed wide. That was Accrington's chance – and it passed them by agonisingly. Then, with the game heading into extra time, Yeovil finished it off.

"Some Liverpool fans might look down tonight’s team-sheet and wonder who many of the Bournemouth side are. But one name will evoke pain, far more even than was felt during the weekend humbling at Old Trafford. It’s five years since Dan Gosling waltzed inside the Park End penalty area at Goodison Park in the dying minutes of extra time to score the winner in a fourth-round FA Cup Merseyside derby replay. The goal went down in Everton legend. Then 19, Gosling became big business overnight but saw a hugely impressive start curtailed by two season-ending injuries.

Gosling is mobbed by Leighton Baines (second left) and Phil Jagielka (right) after his match-winning strike . The rest of his Everton team-mates arrive to congratulate the Merseyside derby hero . Now, under the watchful eye of Eddie Howe, Gosling and the rest of this small seaside town are ready to have a crack at Brendan Rodgers’ beleaguered Reds in tonight’s Capital One Cup quarter-final. ‘It was a proud moment, one of the greatest of my career so far,’ says Gosling, reflecting on a goal that half the country didn’t see after television feeds momentarily failed. ‘It flashed back on when I was at the bottom of the pile. It cut off down in Brixton where my mum lives, but they made the Tic Tac advert out of it (the company recreated the goal), so it probably got more exposure than it would’ve done. It’d be nice to replicate it tonight.’ Gosling's goal was recreated by the Tic Tac's company for a humorous TV ad . Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has steered his side to the summit of the Championship table . While the central midfielder is finding it difficult to force his way into the Championship table-toppers’ league side, the former Newcastle man has been key in this cup run. Bournemouth are the top scorers in the country, and a 12-match unbeaten run has propelled them from quirky outsiders to potential New Year league leaders. Gosling and Howe laughed off suggestions that they are favourites for tonight’s tie, but the problems sweeping Anfield makes this a tougher result to call than it was when they met in January. Why the Cherries, whose 12,000-capacity Goldsands Stadium would be the smallest ever in the top flight, are performing way above their natural station is no mystery. Howe is the hottest young property in English management. ‘Training’s very intense,’ says Gosling. ‘It gets videoed, so there’s no slacking off. We video every training session, and the coaching staff watch it every afternoon.’ That has the stamp of Rodgers on it. The two managers are good friends and Howe has observed his methods. But this level of analysis isn’t even common practice in the Premier League. ‘Sometimes you get pulled in the morning after yesterday’s display,’ Gosling adds. ‘When I signed and they told me I was a bit like, “really?” I didn’t believe it.

This is your profession. If you’re not working hard and not enjoying it there’s something wrong. ‘Our manager is so young (37) and so clever tactically. To know all the stuff he does is amazing really. ‘When we do some of the drills — how has he thought of them? Give me a week and I wouldn’t think of some of the passing drills he does.’ Howe puts his rise down to watching football all week, every week, much like Roberto Martinez or Rodgers. When asked exactly how much he watches, Howe said: ‘I would have to lie — my wife will see this.’ As for Gosling, he hopes a Bournemouth goal to sink Liverpool will be replayed just as many times as that one back in 2009.","Dan Gosling signed for Bournemouth during the summer .

Subs not used: Gray, Naismith, Simpson, Hunt, Barry . Referee: James Linington . Attendance: 6,373 . This will now be the venue that Louis Van Gaal brings Wayne Rooney and Co in one of the mouthwatering ties of the next round. 'If we had a ground which could hold 100,000 we'd have 100,000 on the day,' Johnson said. 'But it only holds a 10th of that, so hopefully all who want tickets will get them. There is no greater prize, it's a game against probably the world's biggest team.' The victory will earn Yeovil an extra £250,000 in prize and TV money – but they had to earn it. This turned into a proper cup tie, tense and tight, as the heavy rain, which begun before kick off, turned the second half more to chance with players slipping and sliding. Shirts and shorts turned brown with mud as the two teams battled, knowing what was at stake. Accrington Stanley's chance to win it came in the 69th minute when Seamus McCarten hit the bar with a 20-yard shot, which came back out to MattCrooks only two yards out, but with goalkeeper Jed Steer on the floor he headed wide.

Substitute Kieffer Moore sealed the win for Yeovil in the 89th minute as headed home . Johnson added: 'Although the quality was not there both teams gave everything, tackles were flying in. It made for a scrappy game. The important thing was the result. 'Playing United will be the highlight of their career for most of our players. We're not under pressure to beat Manchester United, but it's massive. I didn't want to talk about the finances but it's huge for a club like ours. We can't sell player for a quarter or half a million. If the FA Cup draw is good that's the only other way to get it. We've got it. I'm sure the directors are smiling with their glasses of wine.' The added pressure on both teams – that thought of facing Manchester United in the next round – weighed heavy and was felt in every slightly over-hit shot. Every chance on goal and defensive slip was a hero and villain waiting to happen. Johnson said after the match that Yeovil could fill a stadium of 100,000-seater stadium for the United game .

Accrington goalkeeper Rose punched weakly straight to Gillett who hit the ball first-time and into the wide open left of goal. The game was put beyond reach with Kieffer's last-minute header. Accrington Stanley manager John Coleman wants revenge by winning promotion from League Two and taking Yeovil's place in the league above. 'You got the feeling it's not going to be your night when you hit the underside of the bar,' he said. 'It's very small margins. I don't think anybody can argue we weren't the better side in both legs, but sometimes you don't get what you deserve. 'I hope Yeovil enjoy their moment, but I want to take their place in League One and that will be the bigger prize for us.'","Yeovil beat Accrington 2-0 in their FA Cup second round replay onTuesday .

"Jose Mourinho moved a stage closer to the first cup he won in English football, then scotched talk of winning four trophies. A 3-1 win at Derby put Chelsea into the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup but Mourinho said: ‘You spoke a few weeks about being unbeatable in the Premier League - we never did it. Now you speak about a quadruple but we must keep our feet on the ground.’ Mourinho, who won this competition in 2005, insisted Monday’s match at Stoke was his only consideration. He said: ‘We can win on Monday. But it will be difficult.

Mourinho also expressed frustration that medical staff carrying a stretcher did not reach Kurt Zouma quicker as he lay on the floor following a head collision with Petr Cech. Zouma will be available for Monday despite his injury. ‘He was just a bit dizzy,’ said Mourinho. ‘The stretcher-carriers came out walking. When a player is injured and the body language is that he has to go out I feel a bit frustrated. ‘The people with the stretcher want to help and if they didn’t run I have to believe that is the instruction they have.’ Chelsea defender Zouma had to be taken off the field on a stretcher following a nasty collision with Petr Cech . Chelsea's Spanish duo Cesar Azpilicueta and Cesc Fabregas helped paramedics carry Zouma off the field . Derby manager Steve McClaren was incensed that Jake Buxton was sent off in the 78th minute for pulling down Loic Remy, claiming his side were denied a chance to mount a late comeback with the score at 2-1. The former England manager said: ‘The disappointing thing is that we were robbed of the last 15 minutes. It is a big decision, a poor decision. It was six and two-threes, typical tussle between centre half and centre forward. ‘I’m so proud of the players, we grew into the game.

Koeman was clearly upset by the non-stop 'verbals' dished out by Clough and his assistant Chris Morgan to fourth official Paul Tierney with Morgan, a former Blades captain, sent to the stands after Marc McNulty had scored the 63rd minute winner.

'It was a remarkable effort by the players and we thoroughly deserved the win. We had a lad from Ilkeston Town out there, a 17-yearr-old in midfield and a right winger at right back. 'Not a lot is going to disappoint us, you will have to ask him (why he didn't shake hands).'

"New Zealand fly-half Dan Carter has warned England that prolific wing Julian Savea is in 'red hot' form. Savea has plundered 29 tries in 30 appearances for the All Blacks, but it is against the Red Rose that he has been at his most lethal by touching down eight times in four matches. The 24-year-old has been described as better than Jonah Lomu by All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen and will be the world champions' main strike weapon in Saturday's QBE Series opener at Twickenham. Dan Carter has revealed Julian Savea will be the main threat to England at Twickenham on Saturday . 'Julian has really grown. He's such a huge threat and a great player to have on your side,' Carter told Sky Sports News. 'He's strong, he's powerful, he's fast, he can break tackles and he loves scoring tries. 'He has a great strike rate against England and every time he pulls on the All Blacks jersey. He's in pretty red hot form and is a great player to play alongside.' Savea is on a collision course with Semesa Rokoduguni, the serving British Army soldier who is set to make his England debut on the opposite wing. Savea is in imperious form for the All Blacks, he has scored 29 tries in 30 appearances for New Zealand . 'Every player who pulls on the England jersey performs out of their skin, even more so in the early stages of their career,' Carter said. 'For Rokoduguni to come into an environment like this.....he's got nothing to lose and will make the most of the opportunity.' Carter won his 101st cap in Saturday's 74-6 thrashing of the United States, but Hansen hinted afterwards that he is unlikely to start against England. Savea has been most prolific against England, scoring eight tries in four appearances . The last 12 months have seen the 32-year-old complete a six-month sabbatical and rehabilitate a broken leg and troublesome calf, restricting his availability for the All Blacks. However, his seven starts at Twickenham have left him with a clear understanding of the size of occasion on Saturday. 'Every time we play at Twickenham it's a huge match and this weekend is no different. It's a great stadium and a great place to play,' Carter said. 'The All Blacks love playing there and it's never an easy match. It's going to be a huge occasion and we'll be up against a strong England side.'","Julian Savea has scored 29 tries in 30 appearances for All Blacks .

"Dale Jennings bagged a brace as ruthless Barnsley showed no mercy against non-League Chester to book their place in the third round of the FA Cup. Barnsley’s players were woeful in the first match at Oakwell but a rollicking from Tykes boss Danny Wilson did the trick as they swept their Conference opponents aside to set up a home tie against Middlesbrough. The visitors edged ahead when Peter Ramage’s shot was blocked by Matty Brown and the ball fell kindly to Kane Hemmings who emphatically dispatched it high into the net from near the penalty spot. Chester were fortunate to only be a goal down at half-time with goalkeeper Jon Worsnop forced to make saves to deny Jennings and Conor Hourihane. Barnsley players celebrate after Kane Hemmings opens the scoring against Chester . Dale Jennings (3rd left), who scored a brace against Chester, celebrates with team-mates . Barnsley took the sting out of the contest just after the hour when Hemmings slid in Jennings and the winger curled a low shot into the corner.

Matt Done scored a hat-trick as Rochdale comfortably saw off Conference side Aldershot with a thumping 4-1 victory to book a third-round tie at home to Nottingham Forest. The League One side, who beat Colchester by the same scoreline on Saturday, took charge of this second-round replay when Done struck in the 31st mnute.

"Manchester United defender Phil Jones has turned to yoga and pilates in a bid to overcome the injury problems that have blighted his early years at Old Trafford. The England international made his latest comeback for Louis van Gaal’s team in the 3-0 Barclays Premier League win over rivals Liverpool at the weekend. Jones was rushed back ahead of schedule but came through unscathed and last night revealed he has turned to some of the game’s more modern conditioning methods as he bids to maintain fitness. Phil Jones made his first appearance since October against Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday . On Monday Jones (right) visited a children's hospital to hand out Christmas gifts to young patients . The 22-year-old tussles with Mario Balotelli as Manchester United record a comfortable win against Liverpool . ‘I started the pre-season and played every single game and every single training session,’ he said. ‘Then, on international duty, I pulled my hamstring and I have never had a muscle injury so it was disappointing. ‘When I was coming back I then had shin splints. It has been unfortunate. I have been doing a lot of work in the gym and hopefully that will stand me in good stead for the rest of the season. ‘It is strength work, yoga and pilates and loads of stuff. I will do anything I can to improve myself. People don’t wake up one morning and say, “I fancy being injured today’’. It is just the way it is. ‘My aim right now is to stay fit and stay focused and get a run of games under my belt.’ Jones slides in to challenge Liverpool's Raheem Sterling during Sunday's 3-0 Premier League win . Jones received a yellow card after sending Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho tumbling . If Jones sounds defensive about his injury record then it is perhaps understandable. Since signing from Blackburn, the 22-year-old has made a relatively modest 69 league starts in three-and-a-half seasons and has suffered more than a dozen injuries. On Sunday against Liverpool, however, he produced a performance fundamental to United’s victory. ‘The first 20 minutes were a bit of a whirlwind for me to be honest,’ he said. ‘But it was great to be back out there. ‘We know that we are not firing on all cylinders yet but we are learning and we will keep improving.’ Midfielder Ander Herrera declared his innocence int he face of match-fixing allegations . The allegations date back to the midfelder's time in Spain with Athletic Bilbao . Meanwhile, United midfielder Ander Herrera has declared his innocence in the face of allegations of match-fixing in Spain. Herrera and Swansea midfielder Jefferson Montero are among 41 players, coaches and directors named in an investigation. Prosecutors allege almost one million euros was used to pay Levante players to lose their match against Zaragoza at the end of the 2010-11 season. In a statement on his Facebook page, Herrera said: ‘I have never had and will never have anything to do with manipulating match results. If I am ever called to testify in any judicial hearing I’ll be happy to attend as my conscience is totally clear.’","Phil Jones has suffered numerous injuries since joining Man Utd in 2011 .

"The bodies of nearly 800 babies are believed to have been interred in a concrete tank beside a former home for unmarried mothers. The dead babies are thought to have been secretly buried beside a home for single mothers and their children in County Galway, Ireland, over a period of 36 years. It is suspected that 796 children were interred on unconsecrated ground without headstones or coffins next to the home run by the Bon Secours nuns in Tuam between 1925 and 1961. Newly unearthed reports show that they suffered malnutrition and neglect, which caused the deaths of many, while others died of measles, convulsions, TB, gastroenteritis and pneumonia. Scandal: Ireland's historic adoption scandal was compounded by the recent discovery of a mass grave at Tuam . The babies were usually buried in a plain shroud without a coffin in a plot that had housed a water tank attached to the workhouse that preceded the mother and child home. No memorial was erected to the dead children and the grave was left unmarked. The site is now surrounded by a housing estate. But a missing persons' report just filed to Irish police, gardai, means that the burial site may now be excavated. A relative of one boy who lived there, William Joseph Dolan, has made a formal complaint to gardai after she failed to find his death certificate, despite records in the home stating that he had died. A source close to the investigation said: 'No one knows the total number of babies in the grave. There are 796 death records but they are only the ones we know of. 'God knows who else is in the grave. It's been lying there for years and no one knows the full extent or total of bodies down there.' The existence of the grave was uncovered by local woman Catherine Corless, who compiled the records of 796 babies who died at the home. She has established a group called the Children's Home Graveyard Committee to erect a memorial. She said: 'People who had relations there are the most interested. They are delighted something is being done. Horror: The scandal of the babies in the mass grave was discovered by local historian, Catherine Corless . 'When I was doing the research, someone mentioned there was a graveyard there for babies but I found out there was more to it than that.' With the help of the Births and Deaths Registrar in Galway, Mrs Corless researched all children whose place of death was marked 'Children's Home, Tuam'. Galway County Council has all the cemetery books for Mayo and Galway, and with the help of the archivist there, Mrs Corless cross-checked the grave records. She said: 'There was just one child who was buried in a family plot in the graveyard in Tuam. That's how I am certain there are 796 children in the mass grave. These girls were run out of their family home and never taken back, so why would they take the babies back to bury them, either?' Bridget Dolan: Her two sons were placed in the Mother and Baby home at Tuam and both are recorded as having died there . The records state that a young single mother called Bridget Dolan from Clonfert, Co Galway, gave birth to two boys who were placed in the home. John Desmond Dolan was born on 22 February 1946 weighing 8lb 9oz. His birth was recorded as 'normal' but he died from measles on 11 June 1947. His brother, William Joseph Dolan, was born on  21 May 1950 and was said to have died the following year, but there is no death certificate for William. His relative, who asked not to be named, said: 'I just want to know what happened to him.  He may have passed on, yet there is no death certificate. I believe he might have been fostered out, and then moved to the US. 'He could still be alive, or he's with his brother in the grave. I want to find out.' A local health board inspection report carried out in 1944 reveals the conditions the children and their mothers lived in. It reveals that in April that year, 271 children were listed as living there with 61 single mothers, a total of 333 - way over its capacity of 243. One 13-month-old boy was described as a 'miserable, emaciated child with voracious appetite and no control over bodily functions and probably mentally defective'. In the same room was a 'delicate' ten-month-old baby who was a 'child of itinerants', while one five-year-old child was described as having 'hands growing near shoulders'. Another 31 infants in the same room were described as 'poor babies, emaciated and not thriving'. The majority were aged between three weeks and 13 months and were 'fragile, pot-bellied and emaciated'. The oldest child who died there was Sheila Tuohy, aged nine, in 1934. One of the youngest was Thomas Duffy, aged two days. Teresa Kelly, the chairman of the Children's Home Graveyard Committee, said an excavation was long overdue. 'It's an awful story,' she said.  'It's a mass grave.  Many of the babies were malnourished. We want to make sure those children's identities are acknowledged. They had names, they were human beings, not animals.' The grave was discovered in the 1970s by 12-year-old friends, Barry Sweeney and Francis Hopkins. Mr Sweeney said: 'It was a concrete slab and we used to play there but there was always something hollow underneath it so we decided to bust it open and it was full to the brim of skeletons. 'The priest came over and blessed it. I don't know what they did with it after that. You could see all the skulls.' The home, which closed in 1961, was one of several such establishments - Catholic and Protestant - for 'fallen women' across Ireland which had astonishingly high infant mortality rates. Sean Ross Abbey in Tipperary was another: in the first year after it opened in 1930, 60 babies died out of a total of 120. Those who survived, meanwhile, were often sold abroad to childless couples. At a memorial service at the site of the home yesterday, it emerged that women who gave birth at Sean Ross and other homes plan to file missing persons reports in a bid to track down their children. Grim: More than 2000 children were sent to families in America by nuns during the 1950s and 60s . Tragic: Many of the so-called fallen women to give birth at the homes had their children taken without consent . Adoption: Between 40,000 and 60,000 children were given up for adoption by nuns during the 50s and 60s . Philomena Lee, whose three-year-old son, Anthony, was handed over by nuns at Sean Ross to an American family 60 years ago, was among those at the memorial service. She said: 'It's not about getting angry, it's about doing what's right and it's about opening all the files.' And Mrs Lee, whose story was made into the Oscar-nominated film, Philomena, added: 'Maybe the State never thought the mass graves would be found out about. They seem to be wanting to push it under the carpet, but it needs to be told.' She said: 'I don't know how many bodies of mothers and children are in graves all over the country, . 'I'm shocked at the latest news of the mass grave [at Tuam] - it's appalling and shouldn't be hidden.' Children in the playroom at Sean Ross Abbey: Such homes for 'fallen women' and their children existed across Ireland . Cribs and playpens: The homes were run by nuns, both from the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches . The mothers of children given up for adoption by nuns are now calling for more information about their babies . An 85-year-old woman who survived the children's home in Tuam has told of the miserable conditions at the home, where she was placed in 1932. The woman, who gave her name only as Mary, and now lives in the west of Ireland, spent four years in the home before being placed with a foster family. She said: 'I remember going into the home when I was about four. There was a massive hall in it and it was full of young kids running round and they were dirty and cold. 'There were well over 100 children in there and there were three or four nuns who minded us. 'The building was very old and we were let out the odd time, but at night the place was absolutely freezing with big stone walls. 'When we were eating it was in this big long hall and they gave us all this soup out of a big pot, which I remember very well. It was rotten to taste, but it was better than starving.' Mary recalled that the children were 'rarely washed', and often wore the same clothes for weeks at a time. She said: 'We were filthy dirty. I remember one time when I soiled myself, the nuns ducked me down into a big cold bath and I never liked nuns after that.'","Hundreds of babies and toddlers believed to be buried in Tuam, Co Galway .

Jose Mourinho went mad at the people carrying the stretcher onto the pitch as Kurt Zouma lay stricken on the floor, physically pushing two of the quartet to hurry up. Cesc Fabregas and Cesar Azpilicueta then ran over to drag them along quicker. It was odd to see such medical staff walking but the doctors were already tending to Zouma and did not look in immediate need of the stretcher.

Richard Keogh was culpable for Chelsea's opening goal, just as his error led to Bobby Zamora scoring QPR's winner in May's Championship play-off final. His slip here allowed Cesc Fabregas to pick up his 15th assist of the season, 10 more than any other Chelsea player. Away fans cruelly taunted Keogh, chanting 'Are you Gerrard in disguise?'

'I call it ""crack candy"" because I imagine giving up is like trying to break a crack habit' An astonishing 700 million games of Candy Crush are played every day on mobile devices alone, according to AppData, a leading authority on social media trends. But, unlike so many video games, it appears that instead of teenage boys and men, it's mostly women who are in thrall to Candy Crush. According to the game's creators, King.com, women aged between 25 and 55 are the demographic most loyal to the game. 'Candy Crush is one of those gender-neutral games that has a ""moreish"" quality that can fit in flexibly around a woman’s life,' says Professor Mark Griffiths, director of the International Gaming Research Unit at Nottingham Trent University. It takes up all your cognitive ability because you have to concentrate on it 100 per cent. 'That means you can forget about everything else for a few minutes,' he continues, 'which is appealing to many women - whether you're a stay-at-home mother who has ten minutes to play it in between childcare, or a business executive on her commute. Appeals to women: Candy Crush is one of those gender-neutral games that has a 'moreish quality' that can fit in flexibly around a woman's life according to one expert . 'Unlike so many online games, it doesn't involve killing, fighting or strong male characters or highly-sexualised female characters. What's more, it's deceptively simple and fun.' The rules of Candy Crush are indeed simple. Players move a variety of brightly coloured sweets - or candies - around a grid and line up at least three of the same sweet in a row. Every time a row is completed, the line explodes, making way for more sweets to drop in. With more than 400 different stages, each more difficult than the last, and more being added all the time, players never need run out of challenges. As a so-called 'freemium' product, basic access to the game is free, but users must pay for 'premium' services. Players aren't charged to advance through the first 35 levels but after that, it costs 69p for another 20 levels, although it is possible to avoid paying by asking your Facebook friends to send you extra lives. However, the cost can rise as players are encouraged to buy 'boosters' such as virtual 'candy hammers' for around £1. 'I'll have a sneaky game or two at . lunchtime. When I get home, I'll leave the ironing or the housework and . have half an hour - or more - on the iPad' According to ThinkGaming, Candy Crush makes an estimated £400,000 a day for King. That's £146m a year, figures which have prompted the Office of Fair Trading to voice concern that guidelines are needed to stop firms exploiting young users. King claims that 90 per cent of its players are over 21, but maturity doesn't seem to prevent women like Lucy from falling under Candy Crush's spell. 'I call it ""crack candy"" because I imagine giving up is like trying to break a crack habit,' says Lucy. 'I hadn’t heard of it until I saw that many friends - all intelligent, creative women - were playing it on Facebook.' She admits: 'I've never played any other game on my phone. But I don't like going a day without my ""fix"". I play it whenever I have a free moment. In the morning I play on my commute and when I look around the train, nearly every other person seems to be doing the same. 'I'll have a sneaky game or two at lunchtime. When I get home, I’ll leave the ironing or the housework and have half an hour - or more - on the iPad.' But it's at the weekend that Lucy says her gaming becomes more of a problem. 'Once I’ve got up and read the papers, I'll start playing and that’s me sorted for the next three to four hours. In fact, I only usually stop when my iPad runs out of battery. My boyfriend thinks I'm mad. 'My son Ben, who is at boarding school, can't understand my obsession. I've been known to meet him off a train and rather than give him a hug I've said: ""Just a minute Ben, I’m just getting on to the next level!"" Sour side: The psychological effect of playing is very similar to gambling . 'Over the past four months I've probably spent around £150 playing it. But it's worth it.' Steph Brophy, 37, a bank worker from West Malling, Kent is another Candy Crush addict. She started playing only five weeks ago, but says she’s already losing sleep over it. 'I'm thinking about it all the time,' says mother-of-one Steph, who lives with partner Martin. 'I wake up and the first thing I do is pick up my phone to have a game, then I'll be playing if I get a spare second before work. 'I play it on my walk from the car to the office. When I come home, I play it while I'm cooking the evening meal or watching TV. Martin thinks I'm bonkers. When the lights go out and we're in bed he'll say: ""I know you’re playing it because I can see the light from your phone"" so I have to play it under the covers. 'My son asks: ""Why are you playing that game again Mum?"" It's as if our roles have been reversed. It's taking over my life. I don't know if I’ll ever be able to stop.' 'Housework has gone to pot. I've even been late picking my ten-year-old up from school because I've been stuck on a level' So is Candy Crush as benign as it looks? Psychologists say that 'freemium' games can be an insidious route to more serious gambling problems. 'On first look, games like Candy Crush may not seem to have much connection to gambling, but the psychology is very similar,' says Prof Mark Griffiths. 'Even when games do not involve money, they introduce players to the principles and excitement of gambling. Small unpredictable rewards lead to highly engaged, repetitive behaviour. In a minority, this may lead to addiction.' Jenni Weaver, a 40-year-old mum of four from Bridlington, is worried that she's addicted. 'I'm playing it for eight hours a day now and it's become a real problem,’ she says. 'My daughter told me about it. I was hooked straight away. The longest I've played for is 12 hours with just a few short breaks in between. It's worse than smoking.' Jenni says her addiction is beginning to affect family life. 'Housework has gone to pot. I've even been late picking my ten-year-old up from school because I've been stuck on a level. 'I've burnt countless dinners and let vegetables boil dry because I've been engrossed. I'm trying to limit myself, but I can still spend eight hours a day playing it. It's ridiculous.' It seems that if they're not careful, some players may soon find the sweet taste of Candy Crush turning rather sour.","Game has millions of people in its grip .

"In a few months’ time, most likely before the final game of the Barclays Premier League season on May 24, the new television deals will be fixed in to place. They will fetch record fees and some financial analysts are even predicting that the overseas TV rights (currently £2.23billion over three years) will be bigger than the domestic rights (£3.018bn). Either way, from the start of the 2016 season, the Premier League clubs will be caked in money. Old Trafford was full for Manchester United's match against Liverpool on Sunday . In return, it is time to give the game back to the supporters who pay through the nose to watch their teams. The Premier League are rightly proud that the average number of tickets sold at their games last season was 36,695. More than 14 million supporters passed through the turnstiles at stadiums in the top flight. It is still boom time for the money men. Attendances run at around 95-96 per cent of capacity, which is an impressive statistic given the cost of watching a team in the Premier League. Amid all this, it is sometimes easy to forget that only 25,311 turned up to watch Aston Villa draw with Southampton last month, which is their lowest attendance in the league since 1999. There is one executive at a Premier League team, anticipating the guarantee of £100m in TV rights a season before a ball is even kicked in August 2016, who is considering freezing season ticket prices. Jacking them up again will not go down well. However, Aston Villa's match with Southampton (live on TV on a Monday night) was more sparsely attended . Other than mainstream American sports, there isn’t another industry in the world where 20 businesses are guaranteed that kind of turnover in return for 38 days’ work. According to the recent Price of Football survey by the BBC, season tickets in the Premier League have risen by 15.8 per cent in the past three seasons. Good on Manchester City, for example, where supporters will be charged £299 for a season ticket in the third tier of their new south stand. This season Manchester United froze season ticket prices, but they still generate £109m from matchday income. The Glazers could easily lose a few million on those figures and it would barely register on the record revenues of £420m that will be announced on Wednesday. By 2016 a team the size of United, who already boast 12 major commercial partners, could have a turnover approaching £500m when the new TV deal kicks in. Don’t forget the fans in all of this. Arsenal (£93m matchday income), Chelsea (£71m), Liverpool (£45m), City (£40m) and Tottenham (£33m) could still do more for their loyal support. Wayne Rooney is a star of the Premier League but some fans have to pay through the nose to see him . Arsenal routinely claim that the official attendance at the Emirates is just over 60,000, but an audit last season revealed that the true average is actually 53,788. The Arsenal Supporters Trust have previously declared that the reason for the no-shows is the price of tickets to watch the team (the highest season ticket is £2013 and the highest individual ticket price is £97 at the Emirates). Still, the Gunners pay £2.50 towards the cost of every ticket for away matches, which is a token gesture of goodwill and appreciation. Gone are the days when Junior Gunners could stand in the paddock next to the North Bank for a quid, but the next generation - the 16-25 year olds - should not be forgotten. At Newcastle, where the family enclosure seats 8,200 and is believed to be the biggest in Europe, a dad and lad can watch the Toon Army in all 19 games at St James’ Park for £417. This is an era when we routinely throw around figures about £250,000 a week contracts to Wayne Rooney, to Robin van Persie to Yaya Toure or whoever happens to be signing next. There are fewer eyebrows raised at the astronomical wages paid to the likes of Robin van Persie . Transfer fees are also inflated because Premier League teams have more far more money sloshing around than any other league in European football. It is easy to spend all that free cash. Around £835m was spent in the blink of an eye last summer as clubs competed for the biggest talents at home and abroad. Sadly, our game sometimes overlooks the fans who find the money to watch their team up and down the country. The next TV deal is time for the big pay-back. We have stopped blinking when it comes to super-sized salaries and swollen squads with players picking up big wages when they haven’t a hope of getting a game at the highest level. Some Barcelona fans can watch Lionel Messi play for a whole season for £105 (for a seat in the gods) In Europe there is a brutal reminder that fans come first. The cheapest season ticket at the Bernabeu is £175; at Barcelona you can watch Lionel Messi play in 19 La Liga games from somewhere up in the gods at the Nou Camp for around £105. Most of their income is drawn from commercial contracts and broadcast rights with some of the biggest corporate entities in the world. In return, the fans get to watch the best players on the planet at a fraction of the cost. Here in England, to maintain the Premier League’s status as the best in the world, then the time has come for to remember the biggest supporters.","New Premier League TV deal will fetch record fees for top-flight clubs .

"Who was the best centre half in the Premier League at the weekend? Obviously it was Michael Carrick. And with England struggling to find a partner for Gary Cahill, the solution presents itself right in front of Roy Hodgson’s eyes. Manchester United’s six-game winning streak has coincided with Carrick’s return, and while the finishing of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie, along with the sometimes stunning goalkeeping of David de Gea, have all been crucial in United’s run of results, Carrick has been vital. Michael Carrick has been impressive for Manchester United this season, sometimes at centre half . He is a calming influence on everyone around him, almost as if his team-mates can now relax and say: ‘It’s OK now, Michael is in the vicinity, we can just give it to him and we’ll be OK, we’ll keep possession.’ Few players have the spatial awareness and ability to know where everyone is on the pitch, and how much space they’re in. It seems to come naturally to Carrick. While Louis van Gaal has every reason to curse his luck with injuries this season, he has been blessed with good fortune by the return of Carrick, and the revelation that he is actually one of the best centre halves at the club. I’m not sure the Dutchman was banking on that. I’ve always been a massive fan but I thought his England chance had gone. And when I talk about his England chance, I mean Carrick being a regular in the national side. He has been criminally overlooked, and in my view England now owe it to Carrick to make him a regular, and in the immediate future, he can easily fill that troublesome second centre half role. Some will only fancy him as one of three centre halves, but he’s so good I don’t see why he can’t be one of two. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal congratulates Carrick after the win at Southampton . Carrick has the ability to play in both defence and in midfield for both United and England . And I think he will get the chance as well. This is what England coach and Carrick’s former team-mate Gary Neville told me about Carrick when I interviewed him recently: ‘The players that play with him love him, and Sir Alex Ferguson picked him in probably 95 per cent of games during the most successful period of Manchester United’s history. What he does isn’t wow, it’s largely unseen stuff, but a lot of midfielders don’t do it.’ At United he won five titles in his first seven years, played in three Champions League finals and won one of them. Yet his international career never took off. He made his England debut in May 2001 in a 4-0 friendly win over Mexico at Derby County’s Pride Park. But from that game, all the way through to the end of the World Cup in South Africa in 2010, Carrick was never been an established regular in the England team. Carrick has won 31 caps for England - but should have won far more . Carrick often found himself on the substitutes bench for England . Players such as Jermaine Jenas were often picked for England ahead of Carrick . Between his debut and England’s 4-1 thrashing at the hands of Germany in 2010, Carrick played 22 times for England, 16 of those in friendlies, and in only 10 of his games did he complete a full 90 minutes. The best moment Carrick had in an England shirt was controlling the midfield in a man of the match display in Berlin in November 2008. They beat Germany 2-1 that night. It was Carrick’s first international for over a year. He won the Premier League title and the Champions League with United in 2007-08; also in that season he played just once for England, in a friendly. He was overlooked for crucial qualifiers in Russia and at home to Croatia – England lost both and didn’t make it to Euro 2008. One of Carrick's best performances for England came in the 2-1 friendly win over Germany in 2008 . The most remarkable fact about Carrick’s international career is that he didn’t play a meaningful, competitive game for England from October 2006 through to September 2012. That’s the period when he was helping Manchester United to domestic and European success. So while successive England managers struggled with the tricky Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard dilemma, Gareth Barry and Scott Parker were golden boys for a while – even Jermaine Jenas played 21 times for England – the man trusted by Ferguson in Manchester United’s central midfield was repeatedly overlooked. Carrick has played a key role in helping United win five Premier League titles in his time at Old Trafford . Heads gone for the managers who ignored him, and in particular Fabio Capello. A month after Carrick’s son was born, Capello took the midfielder to South Africa for the World Cup. England were an embarrassing shambles, couldn’t pass the ball to each other, yet Carrick spent no time on the field at all. Not one second. Worse than that, Capello didn’t even take him to one side to explain why. So that’s why this player deserves his England chance, along with the fact he’s in brilliant form whether it’s at centre half or central midfield. Carrick isn’t a player who has let England down, the truth is the other way round. Head here to Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Hillary Rodham Clinton said the U.S. should never be involved in torture anywhere in the world  - and also slipped an anti-police protester's motto into her speech. The potential presidential candidate said on Tuesday at a star-studded gala in her honor that she's proud to have been part of an administration that 'banned illegal renditions and brutal interrogations.' Clinton spoke about the importance of the nation acting in accordance with its values after receiving an award from The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights at a gala in New York, where she addressed an audience including Robert De Niro and Tony Bennett and a clutch of the Kennedy clan. Scroll down for video . Denunciation: Hillary Clinton spoke out against torture while receiving an award at the Robert F Kennedy Ripple of Hope ceremony in New York City . Famous friends: Clinton gave a speech to luminaries including Robert De Nrio (right), Tonny Bennet (left), Donato Tramuto (second left), Kerry Kennedy (right of Clinton) and Ethel Kennedyu . 'Today we can say again in a loud and clear voice that the United States should never condone or practice torture anywhere in the world,' Clinton told the audience. 'That should be absolutely clear as a matter of both policy and law, including our international treaty obligations.' The remarks marked Clinton's first on the subject since the release of a Senate report last week investigating the CIA's interrogation techniques after 9/11. The report has sparked questions about the appropriate use of force in the war against terrorism. Clinton said that recent world events, including the mass murder of children in Pakistan and the siege in Sydney, Australia, 'should steal our resolve and underscore that our values are what set us apart from our adversaries.'

Hillary Rodham Clinton is the frontrunner in the 2016 presidential election, a poll has said. Although she has yet to announce her candidacy, 50 per cent of American voters have said they can see themselves supporting her if she runs. Republican nominee 2012 Mitt Romney fared marginally better with 33 per cent saying they could see themselves supporting him. Clinton said Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968, would agree that it's 'possible to keep us safe from terrorism and reduce crime and violence without relying on torture abroad or unnecessary force or excessive incarceration at home.' Clinton, a former first lady, New York senator and U.S. Secretary of State, is considering another run for president and is viewed as the likely Democratic nominee if she runs. She was honored at the Kennedy organization's star-studded Ripple of Hope Award ceremony. Clinton also addressed the recent protests that have raged across the country, and drew links between violence at home and abroad. She declared, 'yes, black lives matter,' a mantra of demonstrators around the country who have been protesting recent grand jury decisions not to indict white police officers involved in the deaths of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and in New York. Sea of stars: Actor Adam Paul, actress Rachael Harris, actor Mandy Patinkin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cheryl Hines all put in an appearance . Solidarity: Clinton's words echo the cries of protesters against the killings of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and other black men.

Star-spangled: Actress Cheryl Hines poses with her husband, activist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr . She wondered what Kennedy would say about 'the thousands of Americans marching in our streets demanding justice for all,' and 'the mothers who've lost their sons.' 'What would he say to all those who have lost trust in our government and our other institutions, who shudder at images of excessive force, who read reports about torture done in the name of our country, who see too many representatives in Washington quick to protect a big bank from regulation but slow to take action to help working families facing ever greater pressure,' Clinton said. The nonprofit says the award is meant to laud business leaders, entertainers and activists who demonstrate commitment to social change and 'reflect Robert Kennedy's passion for equality, justice, basic human rights, and his belief that we all must strive to 'make gentle the life of this world.''","Potential presidential nominee said U.S. should never condone torture .

"Western Australia is now considered the world's deadliest place for shark attacks and since 2012 six people have been killed - with the number of attacks said to be rising. In a bid to solve this problem, scientists from the area have fitted 320 sharks with special transmitters that track the animals’ movements. If a tagged shark swims within a kilometre of any beach along the west coast, a receiver will trigger an alert, which then generates an automatic warning tweet.

Among the sharks tagged are tiger sharks, great whites and bronze whaler sharks. The tweets are used in conjunction with the lifeguard patrols and helicopter sightings. The Twitter feed also keeps followers up to date with rescue missions and informs of beach closures, including those that have been closed due to shark sightings.

This location is based on which receiver was triggered. The tweets are sent in conjunction with lifeguard and helicopter patrols . As well as warning nearby swimmers to avoid potentially shark-infested waters, the tags are additionally being used by researchers to learn more about the sharks’ movements and behaviour. Dr Rory McAuley, from the Department of Fisheries told Sky News: ‘The battery life of internal acoustic tags is up to 10 years so the scientific data that may be collected from this shark is unprecedented.’ Ministers have also signed an agreement allowing fishermen in the region to use bait to attract and catch sharks during the summer months. Any sharks larger than three metres will then be killed to protect swimmers. Despite this rise, deaths from shark attacks are rare.

"A multi-millionaire Dallas attorney with close ties to President Obama was aboard the ill-fated American Airlines flight that hit severe turbulence over the Pacific Ocean and shared photos online that revealed the chaotic aftermath. Flight 280, a Boeing 777-200 heading from Incheon, South Korea, to Dallas/Forth Worth airport, was flying over Japan when the plane dropped suddenly and was rocked intensely for 30 to 40 seconds. Following the incident, the jet carrying 240 passengers and 15 crew members was forced to make an emergency landing in Tokyo and Marc Stanley posted his pictures to Facebook. Scroll down for video .

This photo shows Obama whispering something in his ear in 2009 . Four passengers and an airline employee were hospitalized with non life-threatening injuries. Stanley, a Dallas lawyer and prominent Obama donor, made headlines over the summer when he hosted a barbecue fundraiser at his home attended by the president benefiting House Democrats. Stanley, a former Chairman of the National Jewish Democratic Council, wrote on his Facebook page that the plane was diverted to Narita International Airport in Tokyo 'due to significant passenger and crew injuries and alleged damage to the plane' caused by 'insane turbulence.' 'One flight attendant took out an exit sign. High marks to crew. Low marks to AA weather folks,' Stanley wrote on his page. Funnyman: Stanley and his wife (left) posed for a picture with comedian and late-night host Conan O'Brien when he traveled to Dallas earlier this year for a live taping of his show . Reaching across the aisle: Stanley, a staunch Democrat, raised a few eyebrows among his friends by taking a picture with former Republican House Speaker and presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich . The status update was accompanied by photos taken by the Obama fundraiser showing splotches of wine on overhead bins, food and soda cans scattered down the aisle and a beverage cart resting on its side. Stanley, who is married and has three grown children, was appointed by President Obama in 2011 to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Council. In early July, Stanley threw a late-afternoon, $10,000-a-plate fundraiser dinner at his home, with proceeds going to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Besides the president, the barbecue was also attended by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. On Tuesday, Marc Stanley and his fellow passengers were settling into their 12-hour transpacific journey from Seoul to Dallas when the plane hit turbulent skies east of Japan, sending glass 'flying' inside the aircraft cabin, according to a woman on board. 'We were eating and all the food just flew up in the air and pretty much bounced off and fell. There were carts all over the place,' one passenger told TV Tokyo when the aircraft landed shortly after midnight at Tokyo's Narita airport. Japanese national broadcaster NHK said one person suffered a broken bone. The passengers and crew from the flight were given hotel rooms for the night, and the flight will continue to the United States on Wednesday.

The American Airlines plane was flying from Seoul to Dallas when it was struck by severe turbulence . Passengers were settling into their 12-hour transpacific journey when the Boeing 777-200 hit turbulent skies . The Weather Channel says the plane encountered turbulence while flying through a severe storm . Passenger Erin Cherry, 28, who lives in Huntsville, Alabama, told MailOnline Travel: 'There were people injured. The glass plates from business class were broken and being tossed throughout the cabin. 'There were also some people that were not buckled, and their heads hit the top of the cabin. It all happened when they started serving the in-flight dinner. 'It was very sudden -- a few bumps, and then trays, plates, silverware, all started flying throughout the cabin. 'When we arrived, there were several ambulances waiting, and the injured people were escorted out first.' NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, said at least 14 people were injured. American Airlines issued a statementsaying: ‘American’s primary concern at this time is for our passengers and crew on board the airplane and our team in Narita is providing assistance.’ The Boeing 777 – the world’s largest twin-engine passenger jet – was met by firefighters and paramedics when it touched down in Japan. It departed Seoul’s Incheon International Airport at 6:16pm local time and landed at the airport east of Tokyo shortly before 1am local time, about four hours after its departure. Passenger Erin Cherry said the incident sent glass 'flying' inside the aircraft cabin . This screen grab from a webcam shows the flashing lights of emergency vehicles which met the plane . The plane was east of Japan when it turned south and then west as it diverted to Narita airport in Tokyo . The plane was met by firefighters and paramedics when it landed in Tokyo around 1am local time . The Weather Channel said the plane encountered turbulence while flying through a ‘rapidly intensifying winter storm’ that is expected to become a ‘weather bomb.' The network said the storm is associated with a powerful ribbon of 150-200mph winds in the jet stream, approximately 38,000ft above sea level. The storm has prompted blizzard warnings for northern and western Japan, and high wind warnings for coastal areas near Tokyo. According to flight radar data, the plane was east of Japan when it turned south and then west as it diverted to one of the world’s five busiest airports. It was scheduled to land at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport at 3pm local time on Wednesday.","Dallas lawyer and Obama donor Marc Stanley was flying home from South Korea Tuesday .

"With little fanfare to mark a rare bipartisan achievement, President Barack Obama on Tuesday signed a massive, $1.1 trillion spending bill that keeps the government operating over the next nine months. The legislation was a compromise that angered liberals and conservatives alike but avoided a government shutdown and put off partisan clashes over immigration to next year. It was one of the last acts of Congress under the current Republican House and Democratic-controlled Senate. In January, the new Congress will return with Republicans in charge of both chambers. Spending bill: U.S. President Barack Obama addresses an audience of armed forces on Monday at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey a day before passing his $1.1 trillion spending bill . The measure retains cuts negotiated in previous budget battles and rolls back some banking regulations. But it also retains spending for Obama's health care law and pays for the administration's fight against Ebola. The Department of Homeland Security, however, will only receive its money through Feb. 27, a condition demanded by Republican leaders to appease critics of Obama's immigration measures. The department oversees the nation's immigration enforcement. The agreement, negotiated mainly by Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and House and Senate Republican leaders, was the result of a determined effort by House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to avoid a government shutdown like the partial one in 2013 that damaged the GOP's standing with the public. Still, conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas chafed at Boehner's and McConnell's decision not to use the spending bill to challenge or undo Obama's executive actions on immigration, especially ones that aim to shield more than 4 million immigrants from deportation and make them eligible for work permits. Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who has maintained a stance against Obama's immigration policy, strides to the Senate chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday . Likewise, liberals complained about a provision that did away with a requirement that large banks spin off their lucrative derivatives business into separate subsidiaries. They also objected to a provision that permits wealthy political donors to increase substantially their contributions to the Democratic and Republican parties. The opposition from the political left and right added drama and uncertainty to the spending bill last week. Obama made personal calls to lawmakers appealing for their votes. Meanwhile, Cruz and liberal Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren captured the spotlight by rallying their respective sides to oppose the legislation, laying bare the kinds of intraparty squabbles that could emerge in any future compromise efforts by Obama and the GOP.

"Generous Good Samaritans known collectively as 'layaway angels' have been reminding everyone what the holiday season is all about. Many US retailers have dusted off the once-popular layaway option in recent years, offering customers to reserve merchandise and pay for in installments. But shoppers on a tight budget often find themselves scrambling to come up with the money to cover their debt in time for the holidays so they can bring home presents for their loved ones. That is where the 'layaway angels' come in. Scroll down for video . Christmas miracle: Unsuspecting shoppers who lined up at a Charleston, West Virginia, Kmart to pay for their layaway Christmas presents Friday were stunned when Jed Smith (left) approached them and offered to cover their layaway tab . Heartwarming: Smith told customer Leann Heater he was Santa Claus for the day . Tears of joy: Heater, who had reserved $600 worth of gifts for her daughter, burst into tears when Smith took money out of his own pocket and paid her bill . In Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, a donor known only as 'Santa B' shelled out $50,000 to cover all layaway balances at the local Wal-mart (pictured) In Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, a mysterious donor who calls himself 'Santa B' shelled out $50,000 to cover all the layaway balances at the local Wal-mart this week. 'He said he wanted to help take care of folks – to bring everyone a special Christmas,' store manager Steve Myers told Pennlive.com. The do-gooder, who chose to remain anonymous, sent a check to the store and instructed Wal-mart staff to donate any money left from his gift to charity. Shoppers at the suburban big-box store who have inadvertently become the generous donor's beneficiaries were touched by his gesture - but also disappointed they were unable to thank him in person. 'We were scraping together the last few minutes here to pay for it, we were actually going to have to return a couple things,’ Brittny Coeyman told Fox43. 'Santa B's' grand gesture is part of a cultural phenomenon that has been observed in across the country. In for a surprise: Anastasia Waller was wheeling a shopping cart carrying a $300 Jeep Wrangler toy for her 3-year-old son when Jed Smith intercepted her at the cash register . Stunned: Waller had a look of disbelief on her face when Smith shook her hand, wished her a merry Christmas and let he know that he will be paying for her purchases . Altruist: Smith, pictured embracing a beneficiary, said he takes pleasuring in helping others . In Auburn, Massachusetts, Cathy O'Grady, a jewelry company owner and the founder of the charitable organization Sofia's Angels, walked into a local Toys R Us last week and paid just shy of $20,000 for strangers' layaway purchases. O'Grady says her mother, Sofia, who passed away from breast cancer 17 years ago, and who inspired her enterprise, taught her to be generous. ‘She was always a giver, and I wasn't sure how I was going to carry on her legacy and her memory,’ O'Grady told ABC News. ‘It took me long enough to figure out what I wanted to do.’ Unsuspecting shoppers who lined up at a Charleston, West Virginia, Kmart to pay for their layaway Christmas presents Friday were stunned when a stranger approached them and offered to cover their tab. Kind-hearted: Cathy O'Grady, the founder of Sofia's Angels charity,  walked into a Massachusetts Toys R Us last week and paid just shy of $20,000 for strangers' layaway purchases . The kind-hearted Good Samaritan turned out to be Jed Smith, the owner of Smith Company Motor Car, who spent more than $1,000 in his capacity as a ‘layaway angel,’ reported CBS12. 'I'm Santa Claus today,' he told customer Leann Heater. 'I'm going to cover this for you.' Heater, who had reserved $600 worth of gifts for her daughter, burst into tears when Smith took money out of his own pocket and paid her bill. Kmart district manager Dan Radcliffe described the experience as 'overwhelming,' saying that it was a first for him in his 32 years with the company. Anastasia Waller was wheeling a shopping cart carrying a $300 Jeep Wrangler toy for her 3-year-old son when Jed Smith intercepted her at the cash register. Waller had a look of disbelief on her face when Smith shook her hand, wished her a merry Christmas and let he know that he will be paying for her purchases. ‘I have the biggest butterflies in my stomach,’ an overjoyed Walker said. ‘I'm very excited. I'm happy. I'm blessed. This is crazy.’ A Toys R Us in Johnson City, Tennessee, also has been visited by a layaway angel who plunked down more than $5,000 to take care of 52 layaway accounts, including that of Monte Riffey, who was taken aback upon learning that a stranger had paid her $900 balance. ‘Of course, I was very shocked that someone would do that for someone they didn't even know,’ she said. ‘I was very shocked and appreciative.’ Mystery man: 'Santa B' instructed the store to give the rest of the money to charity . Customer:  Brittny Coeyman told a television station 'We were scraping together the last few minutes here to pay for it, we were actually going to have to return a couple things' before her balance was covered . 'Tis the season: Crystal Willis, one of the customers who benefited from 'Santa B,' is seen at the Mechanicsburg Wal-Mart . Another big-time donor paid a visit to the Lake City Wal-mart Supercenter in Florida Monday, closing some 300 layaway accounts to the tune of $63,000. ‘It was an outstanding thing,’ store manager Gary Taylor told ABC News. ‘It's good to know there are still some good Samaritans in the world.’ The Chiefland, Florida, Wal-mart has received a generous check for $51,000 towards the store's layaway accounts, and a location in Kansas City, Missouri, got a $10,000 donation to help out struggling holiday shoppers. The concept behind 'layaway angels' has been growing in popularity since 2011, when Lee Karchawar founded the Pay Away the Layaway charity to help shoppers settle their store accounts, reported CBS News. The non-profit organization, which works with Wal-mart, Kmart and Toys R Us, collects donations from individuals, which are then pooled together and used to pay down layaway balances of families who are trying to buy holiday presents for kids. The charity raised $25,000 last year but expects to double that amount this year, in part thanks to individual 'layaway angels' like Jed Smith, Cathy O'Grady and 'Santa B.'","In Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, donor known as 'Santa B' shelled out $50,000 to cover all layaway balances at the local Wal-mart .

"Phil Taylor is looking forward to a ‘good scrap’ with Kim Huybrechts in the third round of the World Darts Championship after cruising past Mark Webster. The 16-time world champion was ruthless in dispatching the Welshman 4-0 to set up a third-round clash with the Belgian, and he warned Huybrechts against jumping around on stage when they meet in the last 16 on Tuesday. Huybrechts beat Ian White earlier on Sunday at Alexandra Palace, and Taylor said: ‘He is a little jack in the box and jumps around a bit so it’s a matter of keeping him quiet. I’m looking forward to a good scrap. Sixteen-time champion Phil Taylor smiles after reaching the third round of the World Darts Championships . Tottenham star Andros Townsend and his dad Troy were at Alexandra Palace on Sunday . Taylor has warned his next opponent Kim Huybrechts not to start any jumping around antics . ‘He isn’t going to jump around the stage against me. If he does then there will be trouble. Me and Kim are going to play a proper game of darts. ‘He can jump around as much as he wants, but that’s wasted energy and it isn’t going to work on me.’ Taylor averaged 101.92 in his win over Webster, and feels this is the best chance he will get to win a 17th world title. ‘I’ve had everything right and got everything spot on,’ Taylor said. ‘If I don’t win the World Championship this year then I may never win it again. ‘It’s a big battle and a big fight now. I’m 54 years old and this is the biggest chance I’m ever going to get of winning my 17th. Kim Huybrechts jumps for delight during the World Darts Championships at Alexandra Palace . The Belgian celebrates winning his second round match against Ian White . An oche girl makes her way off the stage after turning heads at the Ally Pally . ‘I don’t think you’ve seen me like this for a long time. I’m ready for the 17th win now and ready for a fight and a battle and whatever is thrown at me.’ Taylor believes there is still more in the tank as the tournament reaches the business end, but was happy with his efficient performance. ‘It was nice and steady,’ he said. ‘I’m enjoying it. I’ve had lots of practice and lots of rest. I’ve done everything right for this. ‘Preparation is everything. Roy Keane once said “fail to prepare, prepare to fail” and he is spot on.’ Tottenham winger Andros Townsend was in attendance at the darts along with his dad, Troy. The England international appeared in his side's goalless draw with Manchester United before making his way to Alexandra Palace. Adrian Lewis, meanwhile, survived a late-night scare as he came from 2-1 behind to beat 22-year-old Keegan Brown. Cristo Reyes became only the second person to reach the third round after starting at the preliminary stage . The two-time world champion hit a crucial 134 checkout to take the fourth set, and went on to win 4-2 against the world youth champion in a match that featured 14 180s. Lewis paid tribute to the youngster, saying: ‘He is fantastic. He never gave in and that’s the key to a champion. He is a young lad coming through who nobody wants to come up against. 'I had to dig in deep and keep going at him. I wasn't on my A game by any means but had a 100 average again and if you keep on averaging over 100 you are going to be hard to beat.' In the first match of the evening session, Dean Winstanley survived a fightback from Darren Webster to win in a final-set shoot-out and seal his place in the last 16. Winstanley raced into a 2-0 lead before Webster came storming back to win the next three sets. But after clinching the sixth set to force a decider, Winstanley hit a crucial 79 checkout to break throw in the fifth leg of the final set, and sealed his victory by hitting double eight in the next.","Phil Taylor will meet  Kim Huybrechts in third round at Alexander Palace .

"North Koreans took to the streets of Pyongyang today to mark the official start of Kim Jong Un's reign - as a hacking group managed to shut down the premiere of a film showing his assassination. Horns and sirens sounded in the oppressed country to mark the end of a mourning period for the dictator's father, Kim Jong Il, who died three years ago. The ceremony - in line with a Korean custom of mourning one's parents for three years - marks the true commencement of the younger ruler's reign, as the last vestiges of his father's regime fade. Solemn: North Koreans bowed their head in a final act of respect towards Kim Jong Il, whose official mourning period of three years is now over . Paying respects: Crowds of people bow before statues of the first North Korean dictator, Kim Il Sung (left) and his son Kim Jong Il (right) Assassination: The Interview depicts the graphic death by explosion of the dictator . My time: Kim Jong Un is now more free to rule the country his way after the mourning period . The expression of continuity in the North Korean regime comes as thousands of American movie theaters back out of screening The Interview - a controversial film in which Kim Jong Un is killed. Leaked versions of the pivotal scene show the dictator's head exploding after a missile hits his helicopter and engulfs him in flame. Anger over the depiction of the brutal assassination caused a hacking cell called Guardian of Peace to launch a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, leaking thousands of damaging documents. The group also threatened terrorist attacks on the United States. The move led cinema chains - including the New York City location due to host the premiere - to pull out of showing the film after the hackers promised 9/11-style attacks. Not backing down: Sony has also said that despite the threat, they will still be distributing the film . Sad Koreans: Here women walk past a patriotic memorial holding flowers for the dead dictator . Officials at the Department of Homeland Security have said the attacks are not credible - but many theaters have still decided to back away from screenings. Meanwhile in Pyongyang, trains, ships and cars sounded their horns and masses of North Koreans fell silent for three minutes as they bowed toward the mausoleum where Kim Jong Il and his father, 'eternal president' Kim Il Sung, lie in state. The younger Kim may now be more likely to initiate new policies that underscore his own priorities and goals, though it is believed that major departures from his father's path are unlikely. Since the death of his father, Kim Jong Un has indicated he wants to build the economy and improve the nation's standard of living, but he has also held firm to the North's longstanding - and extremely costly - focus on strengthening its military and developing its nuclear weapons capabilities. Vast: Citizens of Pyongyang bow in Kim Il Sung Square, where huge pictures of their leaders are displayed . The Guardians of Peace threat released on Tuesday reads: . Warning . We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places The Interview be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to. Soon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made. The world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, you’d better leave.) Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment. All the world will denounce the SONY.","Citizens bowed in Pyongyang to mark three years since Kim Jong Il died .

"As movie chains across the country slowly begin to announce that they will not screen the upcoming Sony film The Interview following threats of a terrorist act similar to 9/11, some Hollywood- A-listers are doing all they can to make sure the public gets out and sees the film. Judd Apatow, director Adam McKay and Mindy Project producer and star Ike Barinholtz all took to Twitter to denounce the threats, which come from the group Guardians of Peace, who are thought to be North Korean. The group does not want to see the film released as it tells the story of two men sent to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Scroll down for videos .

'F""""k these terrorist threats. Now I'm going to see The Interview on Xmas day,' wrote McKay on Tuesday. 'The idea that threats r going to stop people from going to a theater & laughing is so bleak... Now I've never wanted to see a movie more.' Barinholtz was a little less extreme, tweeting; 'The Interview is a fuc*ing hilarious movie and you should all go see it and not live in fear of some fuc*ed up country.' Apatow responded to him, writing; 'people will now want to see it to know why they are so afraid of it. So their plan to suppress it will ultimately backfire.' Later in the night, Apatow took to Twitter again, saying; 'I am not going to let a terrorist threat shut down freedom of speech. I am going to The Interview.' Dialed back: Mindy Project star Ike Barinholtz took some time to praise the movie on Twitter (above) Very involved: Judd Apatow, the famed comedy director, voiced his opinion on Twitter (above) as well . Proud American: Apatow has been very vocal in denouncing the hackers . Early Tuesday, the hacking group Guardians of Peace, who have been systematically releasing email correspondence and leaking films after breaking into Sony's internal system, claimed an event similar to '11th of September 2001' would occur at theaters showing the film. Sony soon told theaters that though they would not stop from distributing the film, they were not expected to screen it if they did not want to out of fear of these threats. The Carmike Cinemas chain, which operates 278 theaters in 41 states, and California's ArcLight Cinemas. whose Hollywood location is one of the most famed and popular theaters in the country,both said Tuesday evening they would not show the film.

"'Oh, do stop complaining dear': Men can tolerate more pain than women, according to new research . It is a debate that can prove rather agonising for everyone involved. Men have long claimed that their pain threshold is higher than women’s, while women cite childbirth as proof the opposite is true. Now, however, scientists claim to have found the answer once and for all. It seems men can tolerate more pain than women and are less likely to let on that they are suffering because they want to appear macho. According to researchers from Leeds Metropolitan University, gender stereotypes mean men tend to act stoically when they are hurt, whereas women show more sensitivity. Pain scientist Dr Osama Tashani, who recruited 200 British and Libyan volunteers for the study, said: ‘Traditionally, high levels of stoicism are associated with men and high levels of sensitivity are associated with women. Some ethnic groups are described as more stoic, while others are viewed as more free in expressing their pain behaviour. We did not detect differences in pain unpleasantness.’ Dr Tashani monitored sensitivity, endurance and willingness to report pain, and found that men had higher pain thresholds and reported less pain intensity than women, irrespective of their nationality. The British volunteers could not endure as much pain as Libyan participants but were more willing to report it. However, reactions based on gender stereotypes were more pronounced in Libya than the UK, suggesting gender and culture both play a part in how we cope with discomfort. Those who took part in the two-year study, published in the European Journal of Pain, were put through two pain-inducing procedures. In one, they were jabbed in the hand with a 1cm-wide blunt tip, while in the other, they had to hold their hand above their head while a cuff was applied to restrict blood flow. However, according to another study, making them sit a maths test could have been just as effective. Researchers at the University of Chicago have found that ‘maths anxiety’ – where someone is scared of maths regardless of their ability – can cause physical pain. The study discovered that those who experience the highest levels of anxiety at the mere anticipation of a maths test also show increased activity in regions of the brain linked with pain sensation. And the higher the anxiety, the higher the neural activity detected, journal PLOS One reported.","Study tested 200 British and Libyan volunteers .

"One woman who knows the truth of how nuns in Ireland of the late 1950s handled the children entrusted to their care is Mary Lawlor, who was adopted out by the nuns at Sean Ross Abbey, Co. Tipperary. Letters she obtained from her adoptive parents detailing how she was given to them also sheds light on the nuns' attitudes towards children of poorer single mothers. The nuns cautioned the prospective parents not to pick a child of the ‘wrong class’, and to take a young child as ‘the better class girl has to leave here quickly so as not to be detected in her sorrow’. Shocking: The letter sent to Mary Lawlor's adopted parents from Sean Ross Abbey, Co. Tipperary. In a letter dated July 26, 1961, sent to the adoptive parents of Mary Lawlor, the sister in charge of the Roscrea institution reads: . Cherry-picked: Mary Lawlor was adopted as a baby in the 1960s. Here she is shown today . 'We had a wonderful reference from your priest and we think you should take a baby over six months… the baby will be brought up just as you would bring your own child up and a child of two years has been too long in an institution to fall easy into your ways. We have a very nice little girl Mary Margaret who is of good background and very intelligent,’ the nun wrote. Speaking to the Irish Mail on Sunday, Mary Lawlor said the nuns also gave her adoptive parents a book detailing how to look after a baby. 'They were picking and choosing babies, so the older ones – who would have needed a bit moresupport – ended up being left there because the nuns were putting people off them. 'They adopted me out with an instruction book. It's a pity the nuns did not read it beforehand.' In a follow-up letter on August 12, 1961, the nuns wrote again to Mary’s family to organise her adoption. It reads: 'It's much better for you not to come here as you could be known and in order to save any unpleasant contact later on for the child.’ Mary Lawlor was instrumental in organising the first annual memorial at Sean Ross Abbey last weekend with fellow adoptee Edel Byrne. The ceremony included readings from those affected by forced adoptions. One of the letters Ms Lawlor obtained from her adoptive parents detailing how she was given to them . 'We believe there are 700 or more babies also buried on the grounds of Sean Ross Abbey. We want all of the children and their families who were all affected by this terrible period in time to be remembered. We also want a full inquiry, a criminal investigation and compensation for victims.' Another adoptee Mari Steed, one of Ireland’s so-called 'banished babies', has also provided the MoS with adoption letters from Rev. Mother Barbara of the Sacred Heart Convent in Bessboro, Co. Cork. On May 8, 1962, the nun wrote: 'Our expense for this adoption amounted to 160 dollars so we would appreciate a check (sic) as soon as you can after getting Mary Teresa...'

"The Royal Navy’s most sophisticated warship has been ordered to the Falklands in a display of strength as tensions rise with Argentina. Britain is sending the £1billion Type 45 destroyer Dauntless on a seven-month deployment to the South Atlantic while Buenos Aires ratchets up pressure over sovereignty of  the islands. The vessel, which bristles with fearsome anti-aircraft weapons, will patrol the coastline during celebrations to mark the liberation of the islands 30 years ago. Fact file on the HMS Dauntless and its capabilities . Officials said sending out the Type 45 destroyer on her maiden voyage was not a response to increased tensions over the sovereignty of the islands and that it had been planned for a while . This will coincide with Prince . William’s posting to the Falklands as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot – . seen by Argentina as a provocative act. And Foreign Office Minister . Jeremy Browne has announced he will visit the Falklands in June for  the . commemorations. The Ministry of Defence confirmed that Dauntless would sail at the end of March, but insisted it was a ‘routine’ deployment. After returning to work following a cancer scare, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernandez, wasted little time in attacking David Cameron's  'colonialism' statement, saying Britain didn't have 'reasons or arguments' In December, the Mercosur grouping of . countries, which includes Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Paraguay, . announced that it would ban ships sailing under the Falkland Islands . flag from docking at their ports . The British people of Gibraltar should be barred from any talks over the future of the disputed colony, Spain has said. Mariano Rajoy, the country's new Prime . Minister, risked a furious diplomatic row by insisting officials on the . Rock should be excluded from sovereignty discussions. David Cameron is facing fresh calls from Madrid to open negotiations on ownership of the territory. The UK premier angered Spanish MEPs . last week by insisting that the future of Gibraltar would depend on the . colony's 30,000 residents. Going against their wishes of the people - . who have in the past voted to remain British - would amount to . 'recolonisation', he said. But Mr Rajoy and Spain's new foreign . minister José Manuel García-Margallo have vowed to raise demands for . fresh talks with the EU. Mr Garcia-Margallo has already written . to British Foreign Secretary William Hague stressing that there was no . mention of self-determination for Gibraltans in the Treaty of Utrecht of . 1713. Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in . perpetuity under the treaty after the Napoleonic Wars. But Madrid has . defiantly refused to recognise the agreement, which includes territorial . waters three miles around the Rock, and has repeatedly tried to reclaim . them. Under the previous Labour Spanish . government, the authorities in Gibraltar were included in three-way . talks with Madrid and London. But the discussions stalled last year . after clashes in waters near the Rock between the Royal Navy, Gibraltan . police and Spain's Guardia Civil. Earlier this month, Mr Garcia-Margallo made a sneaky jibe over the disputed sovereignty of Gibraltar in the European Parliament. As Tory Euro MP Charles Tannock rose . to congratulate him on his appointment, the Spaniard quipped: . 'Gibraltar, Español.', which translates as 'Gibraltar, Spanish!'. She is taking over from HMS Montrose, . a Type 23 frigate which is far less powerful. However,  Naval . commanders admitted sending the state-of-the-art warship to the region . would deliver a strong signal that Britain had no intention of . relinquishing the disputed territory. A Navy source said: ‘Dauntless is an elite warship. ‘She is going to the Falklands on a . routine deployment, but the fact that the Navy is sending her  and not . one of the older warships is significant.’ Tensions between the two countries . have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 . Falklands conflict, which cost the lives of 255 British and 649 . Argentine servicemen. Buenos Aires has recently renewed . claims to the islands. It has imposed an economic blockade on Falklands . fishing vessels, which have been repeatedly intimidated by Argentine . warships. The islands’ population of 3,000 want to remain British. Tory MP Julian Brazier, a  member of . the defence select committee, said: ‘This sends a very powerful and . timely message to Argentina that Britain means business when it comes to . defending the Falklands.’ A Royal Navy spokesman said: ‘The . deployment of HMS Dauntless to the South Atlantic has  been long . planned, is entirely routine and replaces another ship  on station.’ Admiral Lord Alan West, former First Sea .

"Roger Federer let out a huge roar after winning his first Shanghai Masters title with a straight sets victory over unseeded Gilles Simon in China yesterday. The Swiss world No 3 beat the Frenchman 7-6, 7-6 but was quick to appreciate how fortunate he was to reach the final after saving five match points in his second-round clash with Leonardo Mayer. ‘I got very, very lucky,’ said Federer, referring to his escape against Mayer in which he made 57 unforced errors. ‘I know what a privilege it is to be here today.’ VIDEO Scroll down to see Federer say it was a tough match that could have gone either way .

David Ferrer (ESP) Federer leads the tour this season in match wins (61), wins against players in the top 10 (13) and final appearances (nine) and today he will leap Rafael Nadal to become world No 2 for the first time in more than a year. ‘The biggest concern was to be healthy this year,’ Federer said after winning his fourth title of the season. ‘That’s something I’m just so pleased about, to see that the hard work I put in last year is paying off. Not only is it paying off, but I’m feeling good, I’m waking up normal. I’m not half broken like I was last year. ‘I’m enjoying myself on the tennis court. I’m playing the way I was hoping I could play again.’ Federer (right) didn’t play the cleanest match yesterday, though, even with the roof on the stadium closed due to the extremely windy conditions.

The 17-time major winner finished with 36 unforced errors to 21 winners, but he was the more aggressive player, constantly attacking the net behind crisp approach shots and forcing Simon to try to pass. ‘He still has the same strengths, this fantastic serve and this huge forehand,’ Simon said. ‘Now I know him, so I’m not scared any more when I have to play him. But it’s still so hard to beat him.’ World No 29 Simon was attempting to become the lowest-ranked player to win a Masters title since world No 50 Tomas Berdych captured the Paris title in 2005.

"Scent off: Justin Bieber with one of his fragrances. Elizabeth Arden has said its 28 per cent revenue drop is partly down to the poor performance of the singer's scents . From the Pope to reality TV star Joey Essex, it seems that most public figures have them. But the allure of the celebrity scent seems to be waning with beauty giant Elizabeth Arden seeing a 28 per cent revenue drop because of a decline in their sales. Furthermore, the company said the slump, which triggered a 25 per cent fall in share price, was largely due to the fragrances of pop stars Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. The cosmetic firm said its quarterly pre-tax loss to the end of June was £48m – the worst in the company’s 104 year history. Wild child Bieber, who last week pleaded guilty to charges of careless driving and resisting arrest, had launched three perfumes by his 20th birthday in March this year. His most recent scent, The Key (following on from Someday launched in 2011 and Girlfriend in 2012) is a ‘fruity floral’ mix of pink jasmine and sweet osmanthus blossom, which promises to ‘channel Justin’s authentic voice that inspires his millions of dedicated fans to believe – to believe in themselves, to believe in their connection with Justin, and most of all, to believe that their dreams will come true.’ However, with the singer’s delinquent behaviour and increasing brushes with the law - last month he pleaded no contest to a vandalism charge in California - it would appear his popularity, in terms of perfume at least, could be falling. Meanwhile 24-year-old Swift’s scent Wonderstruck and its follow-on Wonderstruck Enchanted, is also creating big losses for Elizabeth Arden despite being on sale the UK for just £13.50. The American singer says her products capture ‘the moment when you instantly feel a connection to someone, but then there’s that feeling of being completely enamoured — enchanted — when you know a little more about that someone and still feel that strong connection.’ This will hopefully be achieved thanks to a ‘charming and sparkling surprise of vibrant fruits, kissed by a bouquet of soft petals and a touch of sweet indulgence.’ Each year, more than 500 celebrity perfumes are released into an already highly saturated market, which began with the launch of Elizabeth Taylor’s White Diamonds for Elizabeth Arden in 1991 and went on to sell 60million bottles. Sales were at the highest in 2011, when Bieber’s Someday was the biggest selling perfume in America – with one bottle sold every minute in the first week of its launch. Scroll down for video . Slump: Taylor Swift’s scent Wonderstruck and its follow-on Wonderstruck Enchanted, is also creating big losses for Elizabeth Arden despite being on sale the UK for just £13.50 . In addition to Bieber and Swift, Elizabeth Arden owns the brands of Britney Spears, Jennifer Aniston, Mariah Carey and rapper Nicki Minaj. The company, which is having to cut 175 jobs because of the slump, said on Tuesday that half the loss was due to such products, adding in a statement: ‘The decline in sales of celebrity fragrances, particularly the Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift fragrances, was steeper than anticipated.’ Other celebrities with their own perfumes include former X-Factor judge Tulisa, Victoria and David Beckham, Madonna, Kylie Minogue and One Direction. Most of the cast of The Only Way is Essex also have their own brands, including Joey Essex’s My Girl and Sam Faiers’ La Bella. In 2012, it emerged that Pope Benedict XVI has commissioned celebrity Italian perfume maker Silvana Casoli, who created scents for Sting and Madonna, to create his own personal cologne. Around of 75% of Elizabeth Arden’s sales come from perfumes, compared to its rival Estee Lauder which relies more on cosmetics.","Elizabeth Arden says sales slump largely due to Swift and Bieber fragrances .

"Bad tenant: Leesa Wenman set fire to her council flat after two weeks because she 'didn't like the neighbours' A woman faces jail after she set alight her council flat a fortnight after moving in because she 'did not like the neighbours'. Leesa Wenman, 32, has been found guilty of arson after she started two fires in the bedroom of her home in Harlow causing £13,000 of damage. The local council moved her to the flat in the Essex town in late July last year but within two weeks she was having rows with neighbours. Chelmsford Crown Court heard how the 32-year-old was arrested on August 6 after her flat was torched. The court heard how neighbours called 999 when they spotted plumes of smoke coming out of Wenman's flat window. It took firefighters 30 minutes to control the blaze, which caused £13,000-worth of damage. Carolyn Gardiner, prosecuting, told the court that Wenman was 'not happy' with her new home. The court heard she started the fire shortly after she asked to borrow a cigarette lighter from a neighbour and then climbed out of a window and went to a friend's house. She told the court: 'Neighbours smelled smoke, it smelled like plastic was burning. They realised Wenman's flat was on fire. 'This defendant had motive - she had fallen out with her neighbours.' The fire service then had to break in to the flat and put out the blaze. Neighbour Kerry Roche told the court that Wenman had told her she hated living in the new house 'within a week' of moving in, saying she told her she 'did not get on with the neighbours'. Dangerous: Smoke pours from the windows of the block of flats that Wenman set fire to last year. She denied arson but was found guilty . The jury heard how two fires were started in the bedroom, with investigators finding burn marks on the floorboards and skirting board. Wenman was found guilty of reckless last Friday and faces sentencing on August 11.","Leesa Wenman, 32, started two fires in her bedroom in Harlow, Essex .

"Pizzas sold by takeaways and supermarkets are so stuffed with salt they are putting the health of customers at risk of high blood pressure and strokes. Many contain more salt than an adult should consume in an entire day, according to new research which suggests pizzas are getting less healthy. The worst examples were a Stuffed Crust Sausage & Pepperoni pizza from Papa John’s and the now-discontinued Domino’s Pepperoni Passion Hot Dog Stuffed Crust, which both came in at 16g of salt. Pizzas sold by takeaways and supermarkets are so stuffed with salt they are putting the health of customers at risk of high blood pressure and strokes. A Stuffed Crust Sausage & Pepperoni pizza from Papa John’s (pictured),  had 16g of salt . That is almost three teaspoons and some 2.7 times more than the 6g maximum recommended for an adult for an entire day. A survey by health campaigners found that nearly three quarters of all restaurants and takeaway pizzas - 586 out of 802 - surveyed contain more salt than recommended for a day. Pizzas sold by supermarkets were better, however some still contain relatively high levels for a single meal. A Tesco Stuffed Crust Cheese Feast Takeaway Pizza came in 7.2g, and the store’s Thin & Tasty Simply Pepperoni Stone Baked Pizza measured 5.8g. The now-discontinued Domino’s Pepperoni Passion Hot Dog Stuffed Crust (pictured) also had 16g of salt, which is some 2.7 times more than the 6g maximum recommended for an adult for an entire day . Generally, a customer will eat a whole pizza, however retailers give their nutrition label information based on the assumption that consumers will eat only half or less, which can be misleading. Eating high levels of salt over a lifetime is associated with developing high blood pressure and related conditions. The research was carried out by the campaigning group Consensus Action on Salt and Health (CASH), which said the food industry is failing to deliver on a promise to reduce levels. It said some products appear to carry more salt than when it surveyed pizzas two years ago. For example, Sainsbury’s Thin & Crispy Cheese & Tomato Pizza now has 1.3g of salt per 100g, up from 0.88 in 2012. The salt content of Pizza Express branded margherita and pepperoni pizzas sold in supermarkets has also increased. Researchers found that only one third – 38per cent - of pizzas targeted at children in restaurants would meet salt targets drawn up by the Department of Health, which is 1.8g per portion. Some products, including the Pizza Express branded margherita sold in supermarkets appeared to carry more salt than when CASH surveyed pizzas two years ago . Nutritionist at CASH, Sonia Pombo,  said: ‘Most of us aren’t aware of how much salt we actually eat on a daily basis, and thus the danger we are putting ourselves in. ‘With three-quarters of our salt intakes coming from processed foods such as pizza, how are any of us able to choose a healthier diet? We need the food industry to help us improve our diet, not to hide 3 times more salt than is recommended in a day in a single pizza.’ The CASH chairman, Graham MacGregor, the Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Barts & The London School of Medicine, said: ‘Eating too much salt puts up our blood pressure, the major cause of strokes, heart attacks and heart failure, the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. ‘At the World Health Assembly in May 2013 it was unanimously agreed that all countries should reduce their daily salt intake by 30per cent towards a target of up to 5g per day, by 2025. ‘Our survey has shown that many pizza manufacturers are still adding very large and completely unnecessary amounts of salt to their pizzas. This is completely unacceptable and our advice is to avoid eating pizzas from these manufacturers.’ Researchers also looked at pizzas sold in other countries and found even higher levels. The saltiest pizza surveyed is the Pizza Hut Meat Lovers Thin N Crispy sold in the USA which contains 23.6g salt per large pizza. The study found some stores and brands are able to provide pizza with lower salt levels. For example, a Virtuous Veg Pizzetta from Pizza Hut comes in at 1.67g; a Buffala from Zizzi is 0.6g salt and a Salsiccia (Prima) from ASK Italian is 1.8g.

"Desperate: Millions watched the finale of The Missing last night, hailing its ending and the performance of James Nesbitt . Almost seven million people watched the gripping finale of The Missing last night with many completely enthralled by an incredible twist about the fate of 'abducted' five-year-old Olly. By 10pm last night a 1,000 tweets a minute were being sent during the online frenzy about its ending - with many calling it the finest drama of the year and even better than ITV rival Broadchurch. Viewers called it 'mesmerising' and 'brilliant', with some admitting that they could not sleep afterwards because it was so 'disturbing' and 'chilling'. Rows broke out as people were upset that the ending was not conclusive because the boy's father Tony, played by James Nesbitt, still believes his son was alive. While others were abused because they said that it was better than Bafta-award winning drama Broadchurch, which was broadcast on ITV last year and returns in January. David Johnstone said: '#TheMissing ending was incredible. So powerful! Better than #Broadchurch sorry'. Jason McLaughlin added: 'Thought #TheMissing was far better written, acted & directed than #Broadchurch'. Chris d'Lacey ‏tweeted: 'I thought The Missing was brilliant overall and very moving last night, far better than the ridiculously-overhyped Broadchurch'. Benjamin Jones tweeted: 'Plenty of simple people on here complaining that the ending of #TheMissing wasn't spoon fed to them. You don't deserve good tele'. The eight-part series is being called the 'best drama of the year' and has received two Golden Globe nominations. ITV's Broadchurch received similar plaudits and will return for a second series starting on January 5. It was watched by 8.8million but The Missing's peak was 6.6million, last night. The first series dramatically concluded last night on BBC1 as the mystery of who abducted five-year-old Oliver Hughes from a hotel bar in France during a family holiday in 2006 was finally solved. James Nesbitt and Frances O’Connor, who plays Emily Hughes, starred in the first series as an English couple struggling to come to terms in the present day with their son’s abduction during the World Cup eight years ago. Popular viewing: The drama, which also starred James Nesbitt, was about an English couple struggling to come to terms in the present day with their son’s abduction during the World Cup eight years ago . Hit show: Frances O’Connor (centre, playing Emily Hughes) was one of the main stars of BBC1 abduction drama The Missing. She believed that her son is dead - her husband did not . Tony chased suspects himself, and even murdered a paedophile, as he searched for his missing son, in a tragic case which also cost him his marriage and his mental health. But in an incredible twist it was revealed that missing boy Ollie was not abducted - he had chased a fox, finding himself in the middle of the road. The drunk hotel owner, where the family was staying, knocked him down with his car and hid the boy’s unconscious body in his boot believing he was dead. But instead of being taken to hospital, the boy was moved to a safe house where he was found to be breathing. The hotel owner's brother the mayor called in Romanian man who found Olly alive in the boot, and he said he had killed him. While the boy's mother accepts he is dead - Tony continues his search for Olly because a body was never found - and the final scene shows him tracking a boy to Moscow who looks like his son. But police arrest him and he is taken away with viewers unsure about whether the boy is alive or dead. TV presenter Anneka Rice said: 'Fretful sleep last night cos of #TheMissing. Very disturbed by desperate ending'. Kara Fitzpatrick ‏wrote: 'The Missing finale was perfect - James Nesbitt at his best. Craig Saphier ‏tweeted: '#TheMissing was an exceptional bit of tele and a proper harrowing ending too. Loved every minute of it'. Revealed: Olly was not abducted, he was knocked down by the drunk owner of the hotel, who then hid the body in the boot . Tragedy: Olly appeared to be dead as the cowardly hotel owner called the emergency services and then hung up - choosing to save himself rather than the little boy . Pain: Nesbitt's character heard the hotel owner's side of the story from his death bed but would not accept his son was dead because no body was found . Is it him?The final scenes were in Russia, where Tony finds the boy he believes is his son in a flat, right . Anguish: But police arrive to arrest him and he is pulled away without finding out the truth . Today many viewers are rejoicing after the BBC confirmed its abduction thriller The Missing will return for a second series, with producers promising a ‘new case’.

He said: ‘To lose somebody can destroy a person. But to find them again, when so much has passed… Well, sometimes, that can be worse.’ The second series is expected to keep the show’s overall structure of a story set over two different time frames, but it will be a fresh case with different characters and a different location. The writers behind the show, London-based brothers Harry and Jack Williams, said: ‘We always knew that the story of Oliver Hughes would have an ending. ‘But in writing the first series we found there were many themes and issues we didn’t have the chance to explore.

"What's the worst part of your job? Long hours? Rubbish pay? Crazy bosses? Well spare a thought for poor model/designer/DJ Alexa Chung, who claims that free champagne is just the worst thing about working in fashion. The 31-year-old fashionista was quizzed by i-D magazine on the perils of working in the world's most glamorous industry and rather than take the opportunity to talk about body image or the plight of underpaid factory workers, the brunette singled out the posh fizz given out at parties as her biggest gripe. 'Do you know what? I really hate champagne,' she says in a video short for the publication. 'And my least favourite part of fashion is that that's the thing that they love to give out free at everything.' Scroll down for video . Ever the pro: Alexa Chung has revealed that she hates champagne in an interview with i-D magazine . But before you panic that party-loving Alexa has jumped on the wagon, the IT girl confirms that spirits are more her kind of thing, adding: 'I always wish whisky was associated with beautiful dresses because then I'd be having a much better time.' And in the past single Alexa has said that Maker's Mark bourbon and Coke on the rocks 'as strong as you can make it' is her favourite tipple. Not again: The presenter is often expected to sup free champagne at events and parties . When asked to describe the style industry the Vogue writer, who introduces herself as a girl who 'stands in parties in outfits' for a living, tells i-D that it is ridiculous: 'The fashion industry is just like Zoolander if Zoolander was a documentary,' she says. But for youngsters still wanting to make it in the ultra-competitive world of fashion she offers some sage advice: 'Find your voice and have a unique perspective on things. Have a clear vision that's new and fresh.' Or failing that, she says, be so 'slamming hot' that you just get to be there. Works for some...

"Dani Alves is coming to England, according to an interview the player has given to O Globo in Brazil. In news that will put half of the Premier League on alert. the full back is quoted as saying he will be playing in the Premier League next season after walking away from Barcelona after seven glorious years. Sources close to the player told MailOnline on Wednesday night that the player was simply expressing an interest in England and stressed that the interview was given at the end of last season. The interview was with Brazilian food critic Luciana Froes and almost all of its content relates to a project Alves has to create a chain of restaurants but when the conversation moves to his future on the pitch he says: 'This will be my last season at Barcelona. Next year I will move to England. I want to play in the birthplace of football.' Alves (left) has enjoyed a remarkably successful seven years at Barcelona, pictured with Lionel Messi . In training this week, Alves (right) runs with Gerard Pique at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris . No club is mentioned in the the O Globo exclusive but the news is likely to increase interest from a host of clubs keen on the defender who arrived at Barça in 2008 and has since won every honour possible including two Champions Leagues and four La Liga titles. Alves' contract runs out at the end of this season when he will be 32. Barça have already made plans to replace him buying Sao Paolo full-back Douglas in the summer. But the new man's recent debut against Malaga gave an early indication of just how much Alves will be missed. Alves didn't have his best night against PSG on Tuesday but he has played a part in Barcelona going five games without conceding in the league and he was at his assist-giving best in the weekend thrashing of Granada crossing for Leo Messi to score. Alves (left) with David Luiz during Barcelona's Champions League match with Paris St Germain on Tuesday . Barcelona manager Luis Enrique (right) has contingency plans in place should Alves leave the Nou Camp . The two have combined brilliantly throughout the last seven years and the Argentine will miss him. What remains to be seen is which Premier League coach is prepared to take a gamble on the world's most attacking full-back. Here are his options: . Manuel Pellegrini: Loves an attacking full-back although he still has Pablo Zabaleta in that position and with a contract until 2017. Jose Mourinho: There is as much chance of Alves fitting into one of Mourinho's finally-tuned defences as there is Mourinho donning one of Dani's red-trouser and denim-waistcoat post-match outfits for his next Premier League press conference. Arsene Wenger: Difficult to see Arsene making the move although with Debuchy injured he could do with Alves now. Brendan Rodgers: Loves an attacking full-back – with Moreno on one side and Alves on the other Liverpool would be some force going forward… and a disaster defensively. Roberto Martinez: Everton have a right-back shortage. Alves could even help realize Martinez' long-term aim of playing 3-4-3. Mauricio Pochettino: With Kyle Walker out Spurs are another who could do with Alves now. And you can see him preferring a move to London if he does switch to England. VIDEO: Dani Alves has earned a reputation for his terrible singing... here's the evidence: .","In an interview with O Globo in Brazil, Dani Alves admitted that his Barcelona career is coming to an end after seven years .

Pictured is Danielle Duchamps, a character from series one played by Stéphanie Van Vyve . ‘But in writing the first series we found there were many themes and issues we didn’t have the chance to explore. The response to the show has been fantastic. ‘And we’re thrilled to be telling a brand new story which we hope will surprise and intrigue and tell an even bigger tale on an even more ambitious canvas.’ Charlotte Moore, controller of BBC One, said: ‘The Missing surprised at every turn, weaving a gripping and complex story across two timescales which kept viewers guessing until the very end and demonstrated the range and ambition of drama on BBC One.’ And Ben Stephenson, controller of BBC Drama, said: ‘Harry and Jack Williams’ original drama series has had the nation gripped for the last eight weeks and has proved both a critical and ratings hit with our BBC One audience. With a brand new and fresh case ahead - we can’t wait to learn what Harry and Jack have in store for series two.’ Star: Nesbitt had a leading role in the first series, which Daily Mail TV critic Christopher Stevens said has brought us 'the most baffling whodunnit of the year' Coming up: The BBC last night trailed a cryptic message suggesting a second storyline, with a short advert accompanied by a voiceover from detective Julien Baptiste, played by Tcheky Karyo (left) The show had a consolidated audience of nearly eight million including seven-day catch up viewing, reported The Guardian. The new series will consist of eight hour-long episodes. The show - which has received two Golden Globe nominations - will be produced by New Pictures with Two Brothers Pictures and Playground, and will also air on Starz in the US. It has also been sold to networks in Australia, France, Denmark, Sweden and Canada. (SPOILER ALERT) Last night’s finale of the first series, which Daily Mail TV critic Christopher Stevens said has brought us ‘the most baffling whodunnit of the year’, had a dramatic twist. It turned out that Oliver was not abducted and had simply wandered off - into the path of a drunk driver, who hid the boy’s unconscious body in his car boot. But instead of being taken to hospital, the boy was killed and his body dumped. The culprits were the drunkard, who ran the hotel where the Hughes family were staying, and his brother the Mayor.","SPOILER ALERT .

"A 12-year-old boy will be one of the first patients in the UK to undergo an experimental epilepsy treatment using drugs derived from cannabis. The trial comes after a series of US-led studies found cannabidiol (CBD) could reduce the frequency and severity of seizures in children with acute epilepsy. Patients will receive the medication, Epidiolex, which is chemically based on CBD, a compound found in marijuana that is not psychoactive, therefore does not give a 'high'. Now, the study is to be extended into the UK, and patients are being selected for a randomised and controlled trial of the treatment. It will run in hospitals in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool and London. Max Robertson, 12, who suffers from severe epilepsy will be one of the first patients in the UK to trial the experimental drug Epidiolex, which is based on Cannabidiol (CBD), a compound found in marijuana . The initial focus will be on children with Dravet Syndrome, a rare but serious type of epilepsy that is difficult to treat. Some children will receive the treatment while others will receive a placebo. Dravet Syndrome usually develops before the age of one and causes prolonged seizures lasting more than five minutes. It has a significant impact on the child's development and can be fatal. Researchers will also study the effect on children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, a type of childhood epilepsy that is difficult to treat. This syndrome normally develops when children are aged between one and six and is characterised by frequent seizures of different types. Only children whose seizures cannot be controlled with existing medications will be invited to take part in the new trial, researchers said. Max Robertson, 12, from Haddington, East Lothian, who suffers from severe epilepsy will be one of the first patients in the UK to trial the cannabis-sourced medication. His mother, Lorraine Haddington, 41, said: 'Max was a five-month-old baby when he was diagnosed with West Syndrome. 'He used to be happy and noisy, but he had his first Tonic-Clonic seizure just after his fifth birthday, and about four or five years ago he was diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. 'Sometimes I just think he suffers but he can't tell us as he can't talk at all. He's in his own little world now and we don't get much interaction from him now. The new trial will focus on Dravet syndrome, a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy that begins in infancy. Children with Dravets tend to have normal development as babies but development starts to plateau when they are in their second year of life. Individuals with Dravet syndrome face a higher incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP). They often also experience other conditions including developmental delays, sleeping difficulties, chronic infections and difficulty feeding. There is currently no cure and treatment options are limited - they mainly involve using anti-epilepsy drugs to treat the seizures. Little is known about the long term prognosis of people with Dravet syndrome. 'Last year we heard on CNN about the little girl in Colorado who stopped having seizures after she was put on CBD, and as soon as we heard we mentioned it to the hospital. 'Around that time we met with our doctor (Dr Chin) and he knew that we were very keen on it. 'I got in contact with the company who produce the drug and they said that if we got the go-ahead from the hospital then we could go ahead.' Epidiolex is being developed by GW Pharmaceuticals, a British biotechnology company which is also sponsoring and funding the trial. Mrs Haddington said: 'There was a lot of red tape as there's been no trial in the UK yet, so they are concerned about safety, but we're almost there. 'We don't have the time to wait for clinical trials as to how it will affect people. 'I don't know if it will make a difference but we really just want to try it as I've lost count of how many medications he's tried over the years. 'The early data from the U.S. is giving us a lot of hope which we've not had for a long time. 'We believe it's going to be started in March or April and will run for about 12 weeks although we've not been told exactly what it is yet. We think it's a liquid chemical from the plant.' Dr Richard Chin, of the University of Edinburgh's Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, one of the hospitals where the trial will take place, said: 'Many children with serious forms of epilepsy do not respond to the medications that we currently have available. 'We need new means of treating these conditions so that we can give back some quality of life to these children and their families.' Ann Maxwell, founder of the paediatric epilepsy charity the Muir Maxwell Trust, added: 'I welcome the launch of these trials as it marks an important milestone in our long journey towards understanding the condition and improving the treatment of those suffering this severe form of epilepsy. Cannabis-derived drugs such as Sativex are already used in the U.S., U.K. and other European countries to treat the pain associated with multiple sclerosis and cancer. Pictured, is a cannabis plant . 'As the mother of a teenager with this life-altering condition, I strongly support the exploration of ground breaking medications that could seek out new ways to improve patients' life quality. 'I am excited to see organisations from across the UK work together on the development of this treatment and look forward to the trials' results.' Professor Helen Cross, of Great Ormond Street Hospital, added: 'Severe epilepsy can have an incredibly debilitating effect on individuals. 'These trials will allow us to accurately test the viability of treatment with CBD in a safe and controlled way.' The trials will take place at the University of Edinburgh's Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow, Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool and London's Great Ormond Street Hospital. Cannabis-derived drugs such as Sativex are already used in the U.S., U.K. and other European countries to treat the pain associated with multiple sclerosis and cancer. Two other cannabis-derived drugs, Cesamet and Marinol, are also used in Canada and the U.S. to treat the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and AIDS-related anorexia.","Max Robertson, 12, has epilepsy which current drugs have not controlled .

"London's relegation from the Super League was confirmed at the Halliwell Jones stadium as the winless Broncos suffered their 20th straight defeat of the season at the hands of the in-form Warrington Wolves. Salford's victory over Hull this weekend coupled with this heavy defeat for the Broncos sees London's run in the top flight come to an end and the game's flagship competition without a presence in the capital in 2015. The rampant Wolves made it 10 wins in succession as they had far too much power and pace for Super League's basement dwellers, running in 13 tries. Relegated: London Broncos were sent down from the Super League after a 72-12 defeat at in-form Warrington, their 20th straight loss of the season . Rampant: Chris Hill (left) celebrates the third of Warrington's 13 tries with Joel Monaghan as the Broncos were demolished at the Halliwell Jones Stadium . Winger Joel Monaghan claimed four tries with second row forward Ben Currie and prop Chris Hill both scoring hat-tricks, with the other tries coming from Ben Harrison, Paul Wood and Gene Ormsby while Chris Bridge landed 10 goals. London's points came from tries by Joe Keyes and Scott Moore, with Josh Drinkwater kicking both conversions. Warrington gave a debut to teenager Toby King in the centre while Paul Wood made his comeback from a torn bicep injury on the substitutes' bench. London knocked on straight from the kick-off and that set the tone for the opening exchanges as winger Gene Ormsby and prop Chris Hill were denied tries by some last gasp Broncos defence in the opening minutes. But it did not take long for the Wolves to open their account when in the seventh minute some crisp handling finished with Bridge sending Monaghan over for the opening try. Hat-trick hero: Joel Monaghan scores his third try of the game as Warrington sent out a message to their challengers . And the Australian winger was on the mark again five minutes later when he took Ben Westwood's pass to score and give the Wolves an early 8-0 advantage. But on their first foray into Warrington territory the Broncos posted points as they kept the ball alive superbly and stand-off Keyes crossed for the try which Drinkwater converted. A scuffle between Bridge and Atelea Vea sparked a punch up which raised the temperature a little but the Wolves soon got back to business with four tries in a blistering nine-minute spell. Firstly Monaghan's kick on the last tackle bounced nicely for Hill to scoop up the loose ball and touch down and fine inter-passing between Ben Currie and Rhys Evans ended with Currie touching down four minutes later. Easy: Warrington's Ben Currie completed his hat-trick by running in his team's seventh try . Straight from the restart a superb break by Gareth O'Brien allowed the supporting Currie to claim a quick-fire double and then Monaghan completed his hat-trick when he benefited from quick hands from Higham and Bridge straight from a scrum. Bridge kicked four first-half goals to give the Wolves a commanding 32-6 half time lead. It took the Wolves just five minutes after the restart to add to their tally as Currie claimed his hat trick as he touched down Matty Russell's kick and Bridge converted. London claimed their second try of the game on 51 minutes when Moore crashed over from close range and Drinkwater's conversion went over off the upright. But normal service was soon resumed as Wood on his return to action took O'Brien's pass to score and stretch their lead to 42-12. In the final 20 minutes the Wolves added a further five tries as the Broncos tired with Monaghan scoring his fourth, Hill claiming two more to complete his hat trick and Gene Ormsby and Ben Harrison also touching down.","Super League left without presence in the capital after heavy defeat seals Broncos' relegation .

"Pregnant women at risk of mental health problems will receive extra support after the tragic deaths of a new mother Charlotte Bevan (pictured) and her four-day-old daughter . Pregnant women at risk of mental health problems will receive extra support after the tragic deaths of a new mother and her four-day-old daughter. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) says women who experience or are at risk of mental health problems should receive extra support at every stage of their pregnancy, and after their baby is born. Nice’s 'wide-ranging' updated guideline comes two weeks after Charlotte Bevan, 30, went missing from a maternity hospital in Bristol with her four-day-old daughter at 9pm on December 2. Search teams found the body of Ms Bevan, who is believed to have suffered from depression and schizophrenia, on the Avon Gorge on December 3, and her daughter Zaani Tiana the following day. Around 12 per cent of women experience depression and 13 per cent suffer anxiety at some point during and after pregnancy, with many experiencing both. One in five women is affected by depression and anxiety in the first year after childbirth. There is an increased risk of psychosis in the weeks after childbirth. Women may also experience disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, tokophobia - an extreme fear of childbirth - and eating disorders. The update will help doctors, nurses, health visitors and midwives identify mental health problems in mothers and mothers-to-be. It also offers guidance on the most appropriate drugs or other treatments to safely offer mother and child. Women who have had mental health problems will be advised what help should be available to them if they are planning to have a baby. The guidance states women and their partners who have experienced a traumatic event such as a very difficult birth should be offered extra support. There are also clear recommendations about what should be offered to mothers who have suffered a miscarriage or whose baby is still-born. Search teams found the body of Ms Bevan, who is believed to have suffered from depression and schizophrenia, on the Avon Gorge (pictured) on December 3, and her daughter Zaani Tiana the following day . 'Mental health problems during and after pregnancy are common,' said Nice Centre for Clinical Practice director Professor Mark Baker. 'More than one in 10 women will experience depression at some point during their pregnancy. This increases to one in five women during the first year after giving birth. 'During pregnancy and the postnatal period, women may also experience other mental health problems. Giving women the right treatment at the right time can have a profound effect - not just for the mother, but her family too. The effect of getting this right can last for years. 'The guidance makes a number of new and updated recommendations, covering not only treatments, but also in providing women who are newly diagnosed or with a history of mental health problems with the information and support they need before they become pregnant.' Ms Bevan, pictured on hospital CCTV, went missing from a maternity hospital in Bristol with her four-day-old daughter Zaani Tiana at 9pm on December 2 . Nice says the guidelines have been updated thanks to more information becoming available on using drugs to treat mental health problems during pregnancy, and on stopping medication. More is also known about detecting mental health problems in mothers and pregnant women. Professor Stephen Pilling, Professor of Clinical Psychology and Clinical Effectiveness at UCL and facilitator of the group that developed the guideline, said: 'Having a baby is a time of huge change and any woman can find herself needing help. This updated guideline is about spotting what is not normal for each woman and making sure she gets the right treatment. 'Women with a history of mental health problems are at risk of relapse when they become pregnant, especially if they stop taking their medication. 'Drugs often have an important role in treating antenatal and postnatal mental health problems, but they are not always suitable and so we have again emphasised the need for rapid access to effective psychological interventions. 'It is critically important that a woman is able to make an informed decision about treatment and she is helped to weigh up the risks and benefits of stopping, starting or changing any treatment she is offered or currently receiving.' Mother-of-two Maria Bavette, co-founder of Maternal OCD, experienced postpartum obsessive compulsive disorder and helped to develop the new Nice recommendations. 'Being pregnant and/or a new mum can often be challenging, with a perinatal mental health problem it can be incredibly difficult,' she said. 'I believe this guideline will help to de-stigmatise mental health problems during the perinatal period and encourage all healthcare professionals at every point of contact with a mum to talk about their mental health as well as their physical health. 'Mothers especially need looking after so they can in turn care for themselves and their baby - this guideline sets out which treatments are recommended for mild, moderate to severe maternal mental health problems and needs to be utilised by all healthcare professionals.' The updated guideline makes recommendations for the recognition, care and treatment of mental health problems in women during pregnancy and the postnatal period. It also includes the care of women with an existing mental health problem who are planning a pregnancy, and the organisation of mental health services. Rachael Dobson, co-founder and chief executive of Pandas (Pre and Postnatal Depression Advice and Support), said the guideline highlighted the importance of individualised care for women. 'I welcome these new guidelines as an aid to assisting doctors, midwives, health visitors and nurses identify mental health illnesses in pregnant women and mothers, which will allow the illnesses to be treated and supported earlier thus helping to lower the impact both on women and the wider family unit,' she added. The guideline are available on the Nice website from today. Dr Patrick O’Brien, spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: 'We welcome these revised guidelines on antenatal and postnatal mental health. They come at a time when perinatal health services are in the spotlight. 'Many women experience low mood following childbirth; however, this is normal and should pass. However, women who have pre-existing mental health conditions, or who develop a more serious mental health condition antenatally or postnatally need specialist attention and care. Mental illness makes a significant contribution to maternal deaths and therefore it is vital these women receive the right support at the right time by the right professional. 'We cannot over-emphasise the importance of early identification and reaching women pre-conceptually, especially because women with pre-existing mental health disorders are at a greater risk. Healthcare professionals need to ensure that these women receive the best possible care. 'There is also a need to consider the training and support needs of professionals in order to develop better services for women. They need to be aware that this group of vulnerable women may not want to tell anyone about their condition and, if this is the case, they need to know the correct care pathways to follow. 'An integrated care plan should be developed for a woman with a mental health problem in pregnancy and the postnatal periods that sets out the treatment options and the roles of all healthcare professionals.' Recommendations in the updated guidelines on support for antenatal and postnatal women who experience or are at risk of mental health problems are wide-ranging. They include: . Considerations for women of childbearing potential: Discuss with all women of childbearing potential who have a new, existing or past mental health problem: . The use of contraception and any plans for a pregnancy . Treatment decisions, advice and monitoring for women who are planning a pregnancy, pregnant or in the postnatal period: Mental health professionals providing detailed advice about the possible risks of mental health problems or the benefits and harms of treatment in pregnancy and the postnatal period should include discussion of the following, depending on individual circumstances: . Starting, using and stopping treatment: Before starting any treatment in pregnancy and the postnatal period, discuss with the woman the higher threshold for pharmacological interventions arising from the changing risk-benefit ratio for psychotropic medication at this time and the likely benefits of a psychological intervention. Pharmaceutical interventions: When choosing a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or (serotonin-) noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor [(S)NRI] , take into account the reproductive safety and the uncertainty about whether any increased risk to the foetus and other problems for the woman or baby. Traumatic birth, stillbirth and miscarriage: Discuss with a woman whose baby is stillborn or dies soon after birth, and her partner and family, the option of one or more of the following: . This should be facilitated by an experienced practitioner and the woman and her partner and family should be offered a follow-up appointment in primary or secondary care. If it is known that the baby has died in utero, this discussion should take place before the delivery, and continue after delivery if needed.","At risk women to get extra support at each stage of their pregnancies .

"Salford's former England forward Gareth Hock has been banned for seven matches after being found guilty of making deliberate physical contact with a referee. The 30-year-old second rower was also fined £300 by an independent disciplinary panel meeting at the Rugby Football League headquarters in Leeds. Hock was chasing a kick during the first half of Saturday's First Utility Super League match against Hull when he came into contact with referee Matt Thomason, who was knocked to the ground. Banned: Gareth Hock has been handed a seven-match ban . The player claimed the collision was not deliberate but the panel found him guilty of the grade E offence, which carries a ban of between four and eight matches. Hock was never likely to be shown much leniency after having already been punished twice before for similar offences. In July 2008 he was given a five-match ban after being found guilty of pushing referee Ian Smith while playing for Wigan against Huddersfield and in May 2013, during a loan spell with Widnes, he was banned for four games for making deliberate contact with referee George Stokes . The suspension effectively ends Hock's season unless he wins an appeal. Salford have just seven matches left of the regular season, although they still have an outside chance of reaching the play-offs. Salford owner Marwan Koukash had pledged to defend Hock before the hearing and it would be no surprise if the club lodged an appeal. Hock, who served a two-year ban for testing positive for cocaine in 2009, was axed from England's World Cup squad last October after breaching disciplinary rules and was not included in coach Steve McNamara's 34-strong squad for a mid-season training camp.","Former England forward Hock banned for seven matches after making deliberate physical contact with a referee .

"White British people are now in a minority in London for the first time, it emerged today as census data revealed that the immigrant population of England and Wales went up by 3million over the past decade. Just 3.7million Londoners described their ethnicity as 'White British' in 2011 - down from 4.3million in 2001, and making up 44.9 per cent of the city's population. It is believed to be the first time that British whites have become a minority in any region of the UK. Another major change to the nation came in the decreasing number of Christians - 4million fewer people claimed to belong to the faith as a quarter of Britons said they had no religion. Foreign-born: This map shows the number of British-born people living in England. Darker areas indicate a higher number of British-born individuals living in an area, while lighter areas have a higher number of foreign-born residents. The figures - the ranges of which are found in the bottom left-hand corner - are taken from the 2011 census, conducted by the Office for National Statistics . In 2011, 7.5million residents were foreign-born, making up 13 per cent, or one in eight of the population - up from 4.6million people in 2001. The total population of England and Wales was 56.1million, a seven per cent increase on 2001 - and 55 per cent of the increase is due to migration. There were 33.2million people . claiming to be Christian, down from 37.3million in 2001 and making up . just 59 per cent of the population. 25.1 per cent of people said they had no faith, up from 14.8 per cent a decade earlier, while the proportion of Muslims rose from 3.0 per cent to 4.8 per cent. White British: 44.9% . Other white: 14.9% . Asian: 18.4% . Black: 13.3% . Arab: 1.3% . Mixed race: 5% . The third most popular religion was Hinduism, with 1.5 per cent of the population, while 0.8 per cent were Sikhs and 0.5 per cent Jewish. Nearly 180,000 claimed to be followers of the Jedi religion featured in Star Wars - down from 2001, when around 400,000 jokingly put the faith down on their census form. The statistics emerged as the Archbishop of Canterbury claimed that English cathedral congregations had grown dramatically in recent years, debunking the 'cliché' that the Church of England is fading away. Andrew Copson, chief executive of the . British Humanist Association, said the decline in religion was 'really . significant', adding: 'In spite of a biased question that positively . encourages religious responses, to see such an increase in the . non-religious and such a decrease in those reporting themselves as . Christian is astounding. 'Of . course these figures still exaggerate the number of Christians overall - . the number of believing, practising Christians is much lower than this . and the number of those leading their lives with no reference to . religion much higher.' But Nick Spencer, research director . at theology think-tank Theos, argued 'Religion is difficult to define . and difficult to measure. 'The census measures religious . identification, not beliefs or practice. It's about what people call . themselves, and which group they wish to identify with. 'These figures show that we have a . plural religious landscape, but that doesn't mean we're atheists. Digging deeper, we see that even those who say they have no religion . often have a variety of spiritual beliefs, but they don't want to . associate these to religious institutions.' Religion: This graph shows how Christianity has been in decline as every other faith grows more popular . Change: The number of 'White British' people is at an all-time low following a decade of change . The . data on religion showed considerable national variation - Knowsley, in . Lancashire, is the most Christian town in England with 80.9 per cent of . residents following the faith, while in London's Tower Hamlets 34.5 per . cent of the population are Muslims. Norwich . is the most godless place in the country, as 42.5 per cent said they . had no religion - despite the presence of one of England's most . spectacular cathedrals. Britain's increasing diversity was . emphasised by the data released by the Office of National Statistics, as . it emerged that the proportion of the nation that is white has fallen . below 90 per cent for the first time. 48.2million people described . themselves as being white, making up 86.0 per cent of the population of . England and Wales, down from 91.3 per cent a decade earlier. Within this ethnic group, the 'White British' category was the largest at 45.1million, or 80.5 per cent of the population, a fall compared to 87 per cent in 2001. 7.5 per cent of the population is Asian, while 3.4 per cent described themselves as black. Unsurprisingly, London was found to be the most ethnically diverse region, while Wales was the least. London . is also home to the most immigrants, as 37 per cent of its residents . were born abroad and 24 per cent are not citizens of the UK. One major reason for the explosion in . the foreign-born population is the accession of 12 countries in central . and eastern Europe to the EU, giving them the right to live and work in . the UK - the population of Poles in England and Wales has grown . nine-fold over the decade. Apart from Poland, the other leading countries of origin for British immigrants were India, Pakistan, Ireland and Germany. The . largest increase in ethnic group over the last decade was seen in the . 'White: Other' category where an increase of 1.1million was recorded. This reflects more than half a million Poles who migrated into England . and Wales during these years, the ONS said. Data . from last year's census today revealed the stunning decline of religion . in the UK - with the number of Christians dropping by more than . 4million. Just 59.3 per . cent of people in England and Wales now describe themselves as . followers of Christianity, raising the prospect that Christians could . soon be in the minority. Following . a decade of aggressive anti-religious campaigning by high-profile . atheists, a quarter of Britons now say they have no faith. Those . ticking the box for no religious affiliation rose from 14.8 per cent in . 2001 to 25.1 per cent in 2011 with the Christian category - including . Church of England, Catholic and all other Christian denominations - . falling from 71.7 per cent over the same period to 59.3 per cent of the . population. In addition to the huge spike in atheists, the proportion of Muslims has risen from 3.0 per cent to 4.8 per cent since 2001. Around . 2million respondents listed their partners or fellow household members . as being of different ethnic groups - 47 per cent more than in 2001. For the first time fewer of half of Britons - 46.6 per cent - are married, the data revealed, with nine per cent divorced and seven per cent widowed. Over a third have never married, while 105,000 people - 0.2 per cent of the population - are in a same-sex civil partnership. The census results reveal that the mean age of people in England and Wales is 39.4, with 21.3 per cent of the population under 18 and 16.6 per cent aged 65 or over. Good news for the country came from . the data on education, which revealed that for the first time more of us . have a bachelor's degree or higher than have no academic qualifications . - 27 to 23 per cent. There are also encouraging signs in . the fact that 81 per cent of people claim to be in good or very good . health - however, 10million people say they are struggling with some . sort of disability or long-term illness. Multicultural: The number of immigrants in England and Wales has shot up as the proportion of the population that is white has decreased over the past decade, according to census data . There are now nearly as many Catholics as Protestants in Northern Ireland, it was revealed today. According to last year's census, 48 per cent of population describe themselves as Protestant, while 45 per cent are Catholic. In 2001, 53 per cent were Protestant and 44 per cent Catholic. Almost half of the population described themselves as British when asked to choose from a list of identities. A total of 48 per cent considered themselves British, while 29 per cent said they were Northern Irish and 28 per cent called themselves Irish. And 10 per cent of the population is forced to provide unpaid care to a disabled friend or relative, with 2million people spending over 20 hours a week as a volunteer carer. Further data show some 4.8million people now hold a non-UK passport. Of these, 2.3million have EU passports. In 91 per cent of households, everyone's main language is English - but in four per cent, there is no one who was brought up speaking the language, which could harm the children of immigrants as they attempt to integrate into British society. The statistics also offer a snapshot of how people live. Since 2001, the proportion of people owning properties through a mortgage or loan has decreased from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, but the number of people who own homes outright increased from 29 per cent to 31 per cent. The census also showed a rise in the number of tenants who rent their homes - a figure which increased from nine per cent to 15 cent. Ownership of cars and vans has also gone up by 14 per cent. Last year there was an average of 12 cars for every 10 households - up on 11 cars per 10 households in 2001. London was the only region where the number of vehicles was lower than the number of households. Guy Goodwin, the ONS's director of census, said: 'These statistics paint a picture of society and help us all plan for the future using accurate information at a local level. 'This is just the tip of the iceberg of census statistics. Further rich layers of vital information will be revealed as we publish more detailed data for very local levels over the coming months.'

"A man who set himself on fire in Washington DC's National Mall on Friday afternoon died of his injuries last night, police said. The man's burns were so severe that he has still not been identified, and authorities will have to use DNA and dental records to trace him. He had poured a can of gasoline on himself in the center of the mall and then set himself on fire at about 4.20pm, as passing joggers tried to douse the flames. The man who set himself on fire on Friday in downtown DC has been identified as John Constantino, 64, from Laurel, New Jersey . Important place: The incident occurred in full view of the U.S. Capitol . Shutdown: The Capitol is on high alert in spite of the federal shutdown after  a woman slammed her car into one of the barricades following a high-speed chase . Police said he had been conscious and breathing when he was airlifted to MedStar Washington Hospital Center. Possible . motives for the self-immolation are being investigated, but Lieutenant . Pamela Smith said she was unaware that he carried any signs or had . articulated a cause. Witness . Katy Scheflen said she saw a tripod up near the man but that she did . not hear him say anything intelligible before he set himself on fire. It was also unclear if the man was filming the incident. Some reports say that two male bystanders initially tried to put the fire out using their own shirts while others put the number of Good Samaritans at closer to five or six people. 'I didn't hear a word from him,' witness Adam Stifel told CNN. 'He had already doused himself with gasoline, I saw his gas can.'

"A 15-year-old Muslim girl has been expelled from school in France for wearing a headband and long skirt combination which was considered ‘too religious’, her teachers confirmed today. Sirine Ben Yahiaten is now set to launch a criminal complaint for discrimination and harassment following her exclusion from the Prunais college in Villiers-sur-Marne, a Paris suburb. It comes as President Francois Hollande pledges to reinforce the controversial ban on full-face Islamic veils introduced in 2011. Unrest: The treatment of French student Sirine Ben Yahiaten, 15, who was expelled after wearing a Muslim headscarf, will reignite ill feeling among French Muslims, seen here protesting against plans to ban the burqa in 2010 . All conspicuous signs of religious affiliation, including Islamic headscarves, were banned from French state schools in 2004. But Sirine insists there was ‘nothing offensive’ about the black headband of between one and three inches wide which covered a portion of her hair. She wore it regularly with a long skirt covering her trousers – leading to the college authorities forcing her to take her lessons in a study room, away from other pupils. The college disciplinary board agreed the headband and long skirt combination was an attempt at a ‘religious symbol’. Sirine’s family took the case to the Administrative Court in nearby Melun, which on March 19 ruled the schoolgirl should be ‘reintegrated’. In turn, France’s Council of State reversed the court’s decision, and on Friday the college expelled Sirine for good. A source at the college today confirmed that the headband and skirt combination was considered ‘too religious’ for secular France. French President Francois Hollande has called for further restrictions against the wearing of the Muslim headscarf in public . Groups including Action Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) have now taken up Sirine’s cause, as she prepares to continue her fight against the school. Since the law banning headscarves was introduced, Muslims have been accused of trying to get round the ban, using the kind of garments which Sirine has been expelled for. Many believed Mr Hollande, the new Socialist president, would show a more liberal attitude towards Muslim dress. But instead Mr Hollande has called for further restrictions on the wearing of the headscarf in public. There have been demands for a new law after a ruling by France's highest court of appeals last month which declared that an employee of a privately-run nursery was sacked for wearing an Islamic headscarf had been unlawfully dismissed. On March 28, Mr Hollande called for the rules in ‘public service’ nurseries to be toughened up, so they are similar to those that apply in public schools. There are an estimated six million Muslims in France, and many believe that dress laws are a cover for institutional discrimination against their religion and way of life. France is a secular society, and many Muslims fear even stricter laws will increase acts of racism and hatred against them. The National Front party, which has made significant electoral gains in recent years, has an openly anti-Muslim agenda.","Sirine Ben Yahiaten first wins hearing to 'reintegrate' her into Paris college .

"Killer heels, soft music, expensive hair, lots of champagne. At first glance, this crowd of good-looking women seem to be on a rather glamorous girls' night out, swapping stories about work, kids and husbands. But around 10pm the first party game gets underway and it becomes apparent that this isn't your standard ladies' night. Scroll down for video . Skirt Club is the UK's first women-only sex club for straight girls . After stripping to her knickers, one guest takes her place on the dining table. A line of salt is poured up each of her thighs, a shot glass of tequila placed on her belly and a wedge of lemon in her mouth. Volunteers are requested to slam the spirit, and soon a line of tipsy, frisky women has formed - wedding rings flashing - and Body Tequila is underway. Some neck the tequila, most spend a lot longer working their way up the stranger's body, inviting their new friends to join them before disappearing off to bedrooms to carry on the party. Welcome to Skirt Club, the UK's first women-only sex club for straight girls. It is cool to be a 'lipstick lesbian' right now, with model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne, 22, becoming the poster girl for bi-curious women after her relationship with 36-year-old actress Michelle Rodriguez earlier this year. Glamorous stars Angelina Jolie, 39, Amber Heard, 28, Lady Gaga, 28, and Azealia Banks, 23, have all admitted to relationships with women in the past and research shows that more and more straight women are keen to experiment sexually with girls. All Skirt Club members (some pictured here) have to be vetted by founder Geneviève LeJeune . Skirt Club is the brainchild of Geneviève LeJeune*, a marketing executive and sexually adventurous thirty-something who found London's existing swinging parties a big turn off when her and a long-term boyfriend decided to give them a whirl. Geneviève, 34, says: 'I tried the current elite sex parties but my partner and I both found they were easily dominated by men , often drunk and lecherous. It appeared women were there primarily to please their partners. I wanted something different. Something more glamorous, and where women really were calling all the shots so I decided to try it with a small group of interested friends, and remove men from the equation entirely. 'I have learned that most women are attracted to women, it doesn't mean that they are gay. It’s the fluid nature of today’s sexuality. Most of our members are married or have long-term partners, and Skirt Club is a place for them to have a wild night playing with other like-minded girls before going back to their grown-up lives.' Most members are high-flying career women (this picture posed by models) and Geneviève claims that the club is for sexual deviants who like to play above board . The club celebrated its first birthday last month and from a small group of frisky friends the membership has grown to a community of several hundred well-heeled women who attend parties and events as well as chat through the club's website. Geneviève claims that the club's success is down to its commitment to exclusivity. The monthly sex soirees are held in high-end penthouse apartments in London's trendy Shoreditch neighbourhood, and, like all the best clubs, Skirt Club has strict membership criteria. 'It's free to join, but all applicants have to be personally recommended by an existing member, and - probably more importantly - they have to be hot, very hot. She says: 'Our members are generally very glamorous, professional city women. They expect a certain level of prestige at events - drinks, design, entertainment all has to be the very best - and they also expect a certain level of women to play with. They want to party with people like themselves so being attractive is crucial.' Isn't that terribly shallow? 'Possibly,' she says. 'But it's no different than checking someone out in a bar or choosing a Tinder date based on a picture. Plus there's actually more to the application process, including a questionnaire and personal meeting. We are after women with brains as well as brilliant bodies.' Most members are straight women keen to experiment with other women but remain anonymous (left). Model Cara Delevingne (right) is one high profile woman who has had relationships with both sexes . As head of the membership committee Geneviève will quiz potential members on their lifestyle, education and sexual leanings. She is keen to point out that a Skirt Club party is not a place to find your soul mate: 'For many people it's a once-in-a-lifetime ""let’s check this one off the bucket list"" experience before going back to their husbands. Gay women are welcome to apply, but they probably won't meet the love of their life.' At the monthly events a strict dress code is enforced and sexy lingerie is a must for any party-goers. 'Once we had a student member arrive in ugly Primark pants,' says Geneviève, 'I told her ""they go or you do,"" the knickers came off and she stayed and had a lot of fun,' Aside from the posh pants and no camera policy, guests claim that anything else goes as the lights dim. Body Tequila tends to break the ice and the women are quick to start making use of the venue as clothes start disappearing and the bedrooms and bubble bath gets busy. Events take place at luxury penthouses in London's trendy Shoreditch area . 'Guests can get as involved - or not - as they want,' says Geneviève, who as hostess claims not to get too involved herself. 'Some choose to watch, some end up snogging all night in the corner, and lots end up trying all kinds of things they have never done before. The parties are supposed to finish at 2am but we're often still going as the sun comes up.' The success of Skirt Club in London has led to interest from women (and investors) around the world, especially NYC, Toronto and Miami, where Geneviève has plans to launch new clubs in 2015. She says: 'We're already having to think about bigger venues to cope with demand here in London, and I would love to see Skirt Club evolve into a global community. 'Women are getting more adventurous, and more confident about asking for what they want. We love men but sometimes they just aren't enough, and Skirt Club is here to fix that.' Danielle Smith*, 38, is an executive PA in London. She is a married mother-of-one and has been to three Skirt Club parties. She says: 'When I arrived at my first party I was greeted at the door by Geneviève and ushered into the lounge area where there were lots of beautiful women having cocktails and talking, it was all very civilised. Everyone was really friendly and there was an excitement in the air, a kind of nervous tension. People knew they were there for a good time and that it could get cheeky. 'I didn't expect people to be so approachable and interested in what I did, but I guess that's women for you. We like to talk and we like to flirt. 'You need an icebreaker at any event and after a wonderful burlesque performance there was a guest speaker talking about the difference between orgasming and climaxing (I didn't even know there was one) and this cheeky entertainment escalated the sexual tension. 'The evening had a very natural progression though. Things don't really kick off until after midnight. Women need foreplay don't we? We need to be warmed up. 'After the speaker some ladies continued with conversations, some went off to the bedrooms and some stayed in the lounge where we some fun tequila body shots. If you wanted to watch then that was fine, or if you wanted to do more then that was fine as well. Skirt Club allows women to explore their sexuality without performing for a man, claims one member . 'At one point I went to the bathroom in the bedroom and as I walked by there were two girls on the bed having a grand old time. I thought: ""I could join in, or I could watch, or I could just leave them to it,"" I decided to stay and watch and it was very hot. Later I did get involved in some heavy petting with one girl, then left the party by myself around 2am. 'I would say most women there were straight. Some had partners who were supportive of them going, some ladies were there without their partners knowing. They wanted a safe environment that they could experiment in and know that they were not being looked upon or judged. 'I came away and told my husband all about my adventures and he reacted very well but we have a very strong relationship and are very happy with each other. 'We have been to Torture Garden and another sex club together but Skirt Club is different. When you take the male element out it seems a lot more about you and what you want. You're getting to explore your female sexuality 100 per cent without having to perform for a male watching. 'There's no photography so everyone's identity is kept anonymous and I think that's very important. It means we are more likely to take risks and explore. What happens in skirt club stays in Skirt Club and that's what keeps us coming back for more.' *names have been changed .","Skirt Club is a monthly girls-only sex party for straight women in London .

"TV presenter: Qiu Yuanyuan declined treatment while pregnant to avoid it harming her unborn baby . A Chinese television presenter who refused chemotherapy treatment after discovering she had cancer when she was pregnant has died. Qiu Yuanyuan, 26, of Zhengzhou, Henan, who had declined treatment while pregnant to avoid it harming her unborn baby, died exactly 100 days after giving birth to her son, Niannian. The former chess game show host learned she was pregnant in March - but the results of a physical exam found she had a late-stage malignant tumour, according to reports in China. She decided to stop her treatment to protect her baby, but the cancer then spread around her body – and she was admitted to hospital in September when her conditioned worsened. There, she gave birth by Caesarean section in September to Niannian, who had only been in her womb for seven months and weighed about 3lbs upon his arrival. The mother then had an operation to remove the tumour and 20 days of chemotherapy - but it was too late to save her and she died last week, reported the South China Morning Post. Her husband Zhang Qixuan told the Zhengzhou Evening News: ‘After getting married, becoming a mother was her biggest wish. She chose to save our child. She understood that not everything in life can be perfect. And she said she had never regretted her decision.’ Death: The former chess game show host learned she was pregnant in March - but the results of a physical exam found she had a late-stage malignant tumour, according to reports in China . Memorial flowers: The fate of Qiu Yuanyuan (pictured centre) has sparked intense online debate in China . He added: ‘The only thing I can do now is to take care our child and her family. I hope everyone can silently bless her and our child, and smile at life - just as Yuanyuan did.’ The mother’s death came last Wednesday evening, after her family had held a special meal to celebrate the baby’s 100th day since birth - which is a traditional custom in China. Her fate has sparked intense online debate in the country, with more than 10million users viewing her story last Friday on Sina Weibo, a Chinese website similar to Twitter. Tears: Relatives cry during a funeral for Qiu Yuanyuan last Friday in Zhengzhou city, Henan province . Remembered: The mother had an operation to remove the tumour and 20 days of chemotherapy - but it was too late to save her and she died last week . However, many of those commenting questioned why she had sacrificed her life. One said: ‘I don't think it's good to give up on living, even if the mother's love is great. It's not a beautiful thing if a child is born with no care and love from its natural mother.’ But another added: ‘Even chemotherapy cannot cure cancer, can it? So she chose this way, wise and helpless.’","Qiu Yuanyuan, 26, of Zhengzhou,  had declined treatment while pregnant .

"Sony executives believe a criminal gang of hackers that severely compromised the company's computer network had significant inside help. While North Korea remains the main suspect in the November 24 data breach, it is believed that someone inside Sony or recently fired by the corporation may have facilitated access to the computer network. A major investigation into the hacking incident has found that the culprits appear to have significant knowledge of Sony's internal computer network leading to fears that the criminals had some internal assistance. Scroll down for video . It is believed Sony has been targeted over its movie The Interview which features the planned assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, who is said to have been angered by the comedy's plot . The movie starring James Franco, left, and Seth Rogen, right has been cancelled by a number of cinemas . However, North Korea has denied any involvement in the sophisticated cyber attack on Sony . TMZ.com reports that Sony executives believe that North Korea recruited someone with a grievance against the company to infiltrate the computer network. Sony executives told the website that hackers had knowledge of internal IT systems, email, human resources and payroll. Threats of violence against movie theaters. Cancelled showings of 'The Interview.' Leaks of thousands more private emails. Lawsuits by former employees that could cost tens of millions in damages. The fallout from the hack that began four weeks ago exploded Tuesday after the shadowy group calling themselves Guardians of Peace escalated their attack beyond corporate espionage and threatened moviegoers with violence reminiscent of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The Department of Homeland Security said there was 'no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters,' but noted it was still analyzing messages from the group, dubbed GOP. The warning did prompt law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles to address measures to ramp up security. Those security fears spurred Sony to allow theater chains to cancel showings of the Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy 'The Interview,' that has been a focus of the hackers' mission to bring down Sony. Carmike Cinemas, which operates 247 theaters across the country, was the first to cancel its planned screenings of the film, according to The Hollywood Reporter. It remains to be seen if other chains will follow suit. GOP also released a trove of data files including 32,000 emails to and from Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton in what it called the beginning of a 'Christmas gift.' Sony Pictures has been on the defensive ever since hackers infiltrated its computer network last month . And two former Sony film production workers filed lawsuits alleging the Culver City, California company waited too long to notify nearly 50,000 employees that data such as Social Security numbers, salaries and medical records had been stolen. The filing follows another lawsuit this week from two other former Sony employees accusing the studio of being negligent by not bolstering its defenses against hackers before the attack. It claims emails and other leaked information show that Sony's information-technology department and its top lawyer believed its security system was vulnerable to attack, but that company did not act on those warnings. Sony, a unit of Japan's Sony Corp., potentially faces tens of millions of dollars in damages from class-action lawsuits, said Jonathan Handel, an entertainment law professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. 'It is a serious matter for Sony both in terms of dollar exposure and public perception of the brand,' he said. In 'The Interview,' Rogen and Franco star as television journalists involved in a CIA plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Speculation about a North Korean link to the Sony hacking has centered on that country's angry denunciation of the film. Over the summer, North Korea warned that the film's release would be an 'act of war that we will never tolerate.' It said the U.S. will face 'merciless' retaliation. The film's New York premiere is scheduled for Thursday at Manhattan's Landmark Sunshine, and it is expected to hit theaters nationwide on Christmas Day. It premiered in Los Angeles last week. But on Tuesday Rogen and Franco pulled out of all media appearances, canceling a Buzzfeed Q&A and Rogen's planned guest spot Thursday on 'Late Night With Seth Meyers.' A representative for Rogen said he had no comment. A spokeswoman for Franco didn't respond to queries Tuesday. The FBI said it is aware of the GOP's threats and 'continues to work collaboratively with our partners to investigate this matter.' FBI director James Comey last week said that investigators are still trying to determine who is responsible for the hack. Cinemas planning to show 'The Interview' have been forced to hire additional security due to threats . The New York Police Department, after coordinating with the FBI and Sony, plans to beef up security at the Manhattan premiere, said John Miller, the NYPD's top counterterrorism official. 'Having read through the threat material myself, it's actually not crystal clear whether it's a cyber response that they are threatening or whether it's a physical attack,' Miller said. 'That's why we're continuing to evaluate the language of it, and also the source of it. I think our primary posture is going to be is going to have a police presence and a response capability that will reassure people who may have heard about this and have concerns.' Following a commission meeting earlier Tuesday, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said his department takes the hackers' threats 'very seriously' and will be taking extra precautions during the holidays at theaters. The National Association of Theatre Owners had no comment on the developing situation. Neither Sony nor representatives from individual theater chains, including Carmike, responded to requests for comment. Since the hack surfaced late last month, everything from financial figures to salacious emails between top Sony executives has been dumped online. The nearly 32,000 emails to and from Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Lynton leaked Tuesday include information about casting decisions and total costs for upcoming films, release schedules for Sony films through 2018 and corporate financial records, such as royalties from iTunes, Spotify and Pandora music services. They include information about new electronics devices such as DVD players and cell phones. They also include budget figures for the Motion Picture Association of America, of which Sony is a member, and at least one email about a senior Sony executive who left the company. The emails also include banal messages about public appearances, tennis matches, home repairs, dinner invitations and business introductions.","Hackers targeting Sony's computer system may have had inside help .

"Whales 'sing' for their supper as they mount joint operations to track down food, according to new research. Scientists know that humpback whales have a trick or two when it comes to finding a snack at the bottom of the ocean. But up until now, how they find their meal at night, with little or no light, had been a mystery. Scroll down for video . Dinner time: Whales 'sing' for their supper as they mount joint operations to track down food, a study claims . The latest study looked at the importance of specific auditory cues that these mammoth creatures emit as they search the deep ocean for their prey. 'Humpback whales are known to cooperate with others to corral prey near the surface,' said Professor Susan Parks at Syracuse University. 'Recent studies suggest they may cooperate [with each other], when feeding on bottom prey, as well.' Silent hunters: The investigation revealed that whales make 'tick-tock' noises while hunting together at night in deep, pitch-black water, but are silent when hunting alone . Tasty: The whales in this study mainly fed on sand lance (pictured). Sand lances are most commonly found by fishermen in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, but are found in oceans throughout the world . Humpback are usually found near coastlines and feed on shrimp-like krill, plankton, and small fish. The mammoth creatures are known for their unique songs, which can travel for huge distances. Their moans, howls and cries can continue for hours on end and scientists are still attempting to decipher their meaning. Scientists believe humpbacks sing to communicate with others as well as attract potential mates. Humpbacks migrate each year from their summer feeding grounds near the poles to warmer breeding waters near the Equator. Whales off the coast of Massachusetts were tagged with special underwater recording devices so Professor Parks could determine how specific sounds correlated with seafloor feeding. The investigation revealed that whales make 'tick-tock' noises while hunting together at night in deep, pitch-black water, but are silent when hunting alone. The reason for this change in tactics remains unknown, however. Researchers found that they were mostly looking for sand lance - eel-like fish known to bury themselves in the sand of the ocean floor. Professor Parks suggests that whales' vocal sounds may help flush the sand lance out of hiding to where they're scooped up and eaten. The clock-like sounds created by whales may also serve as a dinner bell of sorts for other nearby whales during late-night feedings. 'Hints of behaviour suggest that other whales who overhear the sounds are attracted to them and may eavesdrop on other whales hunting for food,' Professor Parks added.

"Princess Charlene has given her first interview since giving birth last week and has revealed that she was 'overwhelmed with emotion' when the babies were born. The twins, Princess Gabriella Thérèse Marie and Prince Jacques Honoré Rainier, were born six days ago by caesarean section at the Princess Grace Hospital in Monaco. A week on, the twins and their mother remain in hospital, with 36-year-old Charlene admitting that there's a possibility that the family won't be able to celebrate their first Christmas at home. Scroll down for video . Crazy in love: Charlene, seen here during her last public appearance before the birth, is utterly delighted . 'It depends on the kids,' said Charlene, who married Prince Albert in 2011, in an interview with Paris Match. 'You see, they are the ""boss"" now.' Nevertheless, the princess appears to be enjoying motherhood, telling the magazine that she is 'crazy in love' with the twins and finds spending time with them 'magical'. 'What I can tell you is that they are both very active and very expressive,' she added. 'They are beautiful, adorable, I'm crazy in love with them.' She also told of the moment the children arrived and admitted to some nerves over the health of the babies whom, she revealed, arrived two weeks early. 'At first, I was happy to hear their first cries,' she said. 'I was obviously a bit overwhelmed with emotion. Overjoyed: The 36-year-old said the birth of the twin babies last Wednesday evening was 'emotional' Thrilled: The Monégasque royal revealed that every second spent with the children has been 'magical' Values: Charlene said she plans to bring up the children to hold her and Albert's shared values . 'Every second with them is magical. I look forward to spending more time in their presence.' According to Palais Princier sources, the babies should make their public debut 'sometime next week' but will be officially presented to the world on the 7th January. Proud father Prince Albert has been a daily visitor to the hospital and, last Friday, presided over a birth certificate ceremony at the Palace. The ceremony, which was also attended by Albert's sister Princess Stephanie, saw 20 witnesses descend on the court to watch the certificates being signed. Others to express their delight at the birth include the King of Morocco, Mohammed VI, who sent a note telling of his happiness at the birth. 'I am glad to hear the happy news,' wrote the monarch, 'which, I am sure, filled the princely family and Monaco's people with joy.' First interview: Princess Charlene gave the interview to this week's issue of French magazine, Paris Match . Keeping busy: Prince Albert spent the day hosting a children's party at the Palais Princier in Monaco . Festive: The royal, who sported a festive tie, was joined by Father Christmas for the event . Happy: Prince Albert has been a daily visitor to the hospital and was with his wife when she gave birth . Heirs: Little Prince Jacques is now heir to Monaco with Princess Gabriella second in line . Staying put: Charlene admitted that she and the babies may not get to enjoy their first Christmas at home . Princess Charlene's father Mike has also added his voice to the chorus of congratulation, telling South African news channel ENCA that he was given the news in a personal telephone call from Prince Albert. 'He called us and told us himself that things are good,' said the delighted grandfather. 'He gave us all the details, the babies’ names and all that, and said Charlene was doing very well.' Mr Wittstock, who has previously insisted that his new royal grandchildren would be treated the same as his others, is also planning a trip to the principality to meet the twins. 'We will now wait for things to settle down and then I will send my wife [Lynette] over first,' he said. 'That kind of thing is more of a woman’s job. Then I’ll go and join them a bit later.' Charlene, meanwhile, has spent the days since the birth bonding with the babies in private, telling Paris Match that she already feels a 'strong bond' with the children. Celebration: News of the birth, announced with 42 cannon shots, was greeted with joy in Monaco . Tribute: The days following the birth saw streams of well-wishers descend on the Palais Princier . Jubilation: The babies are expected to make their official public debut on the balcony of the Palais Princier . 'I think a very strong protective instinct in me was born in the same time [as the twins],' said the delighted new mother. 'A strong bond unites us, they are my responsibility in the coming years.' She also told how she plans to raise the twins with the values shared by the Monégasque royals and described the prospect of bringing up her children as an 'exciting mission'. 'I will do my best to guide them, raise them and send them the values ​​that my husband and I share,' she said. 'This is an exciting mission and we will give the best of ourselves to achieve it. For now, we are enjoying every moment.' Support: Since the birth, Monaco has been festooned with national flags - including the yachts in the harbour .

"They might be fluffy faced, buck-toothed little creatures, but two species of rodent have been identified the latest culprits to be contributing to climate change. Researchers have found that the arctic ground squirrel and the beaver may be playing a far greater role in global warming than had previously been realised. It means that scientists will in the future have to alter their theories around anthropogenic climate change to take account of 'rodentopogenic' influences. Menace: Ground squirrels live in shallow burrows around the Arctic Circle but their incessant digging mixes the normally frozen soil, introducing oxygen and leading to the release of carbon dioxide gas . The influence that these two species of rodents have on the climate were uncovered during separate studies of how their behaviour affects the environment. Researchers studying permafrost in the Arctic found that ground squirrels there are hastening the release of greenhouse gases from the frozen soil where they build their burrows. Scientists were baffled by the appearance of mysterious craters in northern Russia earlier this year. Researchers now believe these craters may have been created by a build-up of methane over centuries that has been erupting out of the thawing ground. But strange, unexplained holes are just the beginning of what could be a series of mysterious happenings on the planet – all caused by melting Arctic ice, scientists believe. The methane trapped inside the ice is known to catch fire explosively and could lead to fires spreading. Melting permafrost is also leading to ‘drunken trees’ as the firm soil slowly transforms into mud causing the plants that grow in them to lean to one side. Some trees survive this erosion, while others collapse or drown as the subterranean ice melts. They found that by churning up the normally stable layers of soil, and fertilizing it with their faeces and urine, the little rodents are encouraging the decomposition of biological material that is usually locked in suspended animation by the permafrost. This leads to carbon dioxide locked within the frozen Tundra ground to be released into the atmosphere. Permafrost is known to be an enormous store of carbon as methane gas and carbon dioxide can become locked inside ice crystals while organic matter from dead plants and animal are preserved in the ice. Scientists estimate that the Arctic permafrost is a store of twice as much carbon than is currently in the atmosphere and fear that if the permafrost melts, it will release these huge reserves of greenhouse gases, leading to climate change. Dr Sue Natali, an environmental scientist at Woods Hole Research Centre in Massachusetts, who led the work as part of the Polaris Project to study climate change at the poles, told Mail Online: 'Arctic ground squirrels are pan-Arctic, so their influence may be very widespread. 'But I think this is a larger story about wildlife impacts on carbon cycling, and how this may change as the climate warms. 'The Arctic ground squirrel dig colonial burrows that cause important shifts in soil structure and plant composition. 'Ground squirrel burrowing can impact soil carbon cycling as a result of nutrient addition and by digging up soil which disturbs the plant community, decreases soil moisture, and increases soil aeration.' Scientists estimate that more than 1,600 billion tons of carbon is locked in the Arctic permafrost and if released it could treble the levels of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere, driving global warming . Nigel Golden, an ecologist at the University of Wisconsin who also took part in the research, said that by digging into the Tundra soil, ground squirrels, which are also known as Parka in Alaska, increased the amount of carbon being released during summer melts. He said the temperature of the ground around their burrows was higher than in the surrounding area. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'They are soil engineers. They break down the soil when they are digging their burrows, they mix the top layer with the bottom layer, they are bringing oxygen to the soil and they are fertilizing the soil with their urine and their faeces. 'We saw an increase in soil temperature in the soils where the arctic ground squirrels were occupying. 'This is a major component. As that permafrost begins to warm, now microbes can have access to these previously frozen carbons that were in the soil. 'And because they mix the soil layers, they are being exposed to warmer temperatures.' Arctic ground squirrel, or parka, live in high numbers through out the arctic and climate scientists may now need to start taking account of their role in releasing greenhouse gases in future climate change models . It is not the first time that animals have been found to play a role in climate change - it is already widely accepted that livestock are major contributors to global warming through the methane they emit while digetsting their food. However, the researchers belive that ground squirrels may be playing a far more important role in the release of carbon from the permafrost than had been appreciated. Arctic ground squirrels are among the most numerous rodents in the arctic circle, found across North America and Siberia. With an average length of around 15 inches, they dig shallow burrows to shelter from the harsh conditions and can hibernate for around seven monoths of the year. They feed on grasses and other plants that grow during the brief summer in the Arctic. The research team, who presented their findings at the Fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union, also found that the nitrogen that squirrels were adding to the ground in their waste was having an impact. Dr Natali said: 'Plant removal results in soils that are warmer because plants and organic material in soil insulate soil from warm summer temperatures. 'Warmer soils will increase microbial breakdown of soil organic carbon, and then, that carbon is released as CO2, and increase ground thaw, which means that there is more unfrozen carbon available for microbes to decompose. 'Nutrients added by squirrel waste are needed by microbes to break down the carbon while increased aeration that results from digging also makes more favorable conditions for microbes.' Dam building by beavers is thought to have contributed 200 times more methane to the atmosphere than 100 years ago and the ponds they create in rivers now cover more than 16,200 square miles around the world . It is estimated that around 1,600 billion tons of carbon is stored in the Arctic permafrost. However, the role of arctic ground squirrels is thought to be tiny compared to the melting of the permafrost caused by carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by human activity. Dr Natali added: 'Human activities are the primary influence on climate. We do, however, need to understand how these activities are impacting natural ecosystems, and how these ecosystem responses will amplify or attenuate these human-driven impacts. 'Even though we cannot alter wildlife activity, it's important that we include greenhouse gas emissions from these activities into our accounting of carbon loss from the Arctic. 'But I think this is a larger story about wildlife impacts on carbon cycling, and how this may change as the climate warms.' She warned that further melting of the permafrost due to human activities could also lead to an increase in ground squirrel populations in the arctic. She said: 'Ground squirrels burrow in areas that are dryer and require a deep enough level of ground thaw. 'As the permafrost thaws with continued climate warming, additional areas may be opened up to ground squirrel burrowing.' A separate study has also found that another rodent, the beaver, is also playing a far greater role in the release of climate changing gases like methane than had been previously thought. Numbers of these animals has increased in recent years in both North America and Europe as a result of conservation projects. However, the shallow ponds that build up behind beaver dams produce methane as biological material builds up on the low oxygen environment on the beds of the ponds. Scientists estimate that 200 times more methane is released from beaver ponds now than was being released in 1900. Dr Colin Whitfield, from the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, estimated the size of global beaver populations and the amount of area covered by their ponds. Fur trade between the sixteenth and nineteenth century lead to beaver populations in many areas becoming extinct. But now Dr Whitfield and his team have estimated that beaver numbers have grown dramatically to more than 10 million and estimate populations in Europe and Asia could increase by a further four million. Beaver numbers have soared to more than 10 million globally since 1900 due to reintroduction projects . Ponds behind beaver dams are often less than five feet deep and as a result allow methane from decomposing biological material on bottom of the ponds to be released into the atmosphere rather than dissolved in water . They found that beavers have dammed up more than 16,200 square miles of ponds. The scientists, whose work is published in the journal AMBIO, claim that beavers are responsible for releasing around 881,000 tons of methane into the atmosphere each year. This is about 15 percent of what wild cud-chewing animals, such as deer or antelope, are thought to contribute. Dr Whitfield said: 'The dynamic nature of beaver-mediated methane emissions in recent years may portend the potential for future changes in this component of the global methane budget. 'Continued range expansion, coupled with changes in population and pond densities, may dramatically increase the amount of water impounded by the beaver. 'This, in combination with anticipated increases in surface water temperatures, and likely effects on rates of methanogenesis, suggests that the contribution of beaver activity to global methane emissions may continue to grow.'","Arctic ground squirrels churn up and warm soil in the Tundra, allowing carbon dioxide gas trapped in the ice to escape into the atmosphere .

"A former model who lost her good looks after becoming hooked on drugs and whose boyfriend shot dead a police officer has been released from jail after accepting a plea agreement. Traci Vaillancourt was sitting in a car with her boyfriend Timothy Troy Walker when police Sergeant Derek Johnson approached the Volvo in Draper, Utah, on September 1, 2013. Walker shot Johnson dead and turned his weapon on Ms Vaillancourt, seriously wounding her before failing to kill himself. Scroll down for video .

Timothy Troy Walker, left, shot dead Sergeant Derek Johnson, right on September 1, 2013 in Draper, Utah . Prosecutors initially charged Ms Vaillancourt, 35, with two felony counts of obstructing justice, claiming that she was trying to cover up her involvement in Sgt Johnson's murder. Ms Vaillancourt has spent the past 15 months in custody awaiting trial, however a last-minute plea agreement has seen her released in time for Christmas. Her boyfriend Walker has already pleaded guilty to Sgt Johnson's murder and has been sentenced to life in prison. Ms Vaillancourt told Fox13.com: 'I feel like I`ve been rung out like a rag yet exhilaratingly refreshed, I feel great, it hasn`t hit me yet actually.' Her lawyer Matthew Kober said: 'She wanted to minimize potential risk and that’s why she made the decision to proceed with the plea today, to secure her release before Christmas.' Sgt Johnson's widow, Shante,  said she was happy Ms Vaillancourt had accepted a plea agreement to avoid  a potentially painful trial. She said: 'So relieved that our family doesn’t have to face that, worry about that, go through the emotional drama of that and re-drudge all the details of that day again.' Derek Johnson, left, married his childhood sweetheart Shante, right, who agreed with the decision to accept Vaillancourt's plea agreement to avoid the pain of having to sit through a trial and reliving the murder . Sgt Johnson managed to drive his car a short distance after being shot before crashing it into a field . Sgt Johnson, left, had one son Bensen, right, with his wife Shante and lived in his hometown of Draper, Utah . Under the terms of the deal, Ms Vaillancourt will spend the next 36 months on probation. If she completes her probation successfully, her felony charges will be reduced to a misdemeanor. However, if she re-offends, she risks being returned to prison. Ms Vaillancourt's family said she had been a popular model in high school but was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder after the birth of her first child. Her sister Victoria King revealed in an earlier interview with KSL.com. She says her sister quickly became addicted to her pain medication after suffering four strokes before the age of 30. 'It just went downhill from there,' King told the broadcaster. 'I tried to get him away from her. She chose a different path. … He was bad news from the get-go, I knew it, and the two of them combined, and a loaded gun nonetheless, and strung out on drugs.' 'We tried and tried and tried to help her but you can't help someone who won't help themself,' she added. King last saw her sister and Walker the day before the shootings and was left startled by his behavior. 'He got out of the car and he was hyper, showing me a gun that has a laser and a machete and knives,' she said. The couple were trying to talk King into giving them cash - an event which wasn't unusual according to Vaillancourt's older sister. In the weeks before Sgt Johnson's murder, Walker and Vaillancourt were living out of motels and sleeping in their car.","Traci Vaillancourt, 35, has been released from prison after 15 months .

The Single-Lens Display Module (SLDM) is a microdisplay (left) that fits onto any type of spectacles - from sunglasses to work goggles - while also being detachable for when it’s not needed. Sony said that the module also has potential applications in sports (top right) or for work, to display useful information . SLDM is fitted with a high-resolution, colour microdisplay, a micro-optical unit and a miniature control board. Sony said the board has capabilities that are ‘on par with smartphones’ to show people useful information, quickly, over their right eye. ‘This display module possesses the potential to enrich users' lives in a variety of ways,' said the firm in a press release. ‘By simply attaching it to a pair of glasses, goggles, sunglasses, or other type of eyewear, you can instantly gain access to visual information that adds a level of convenience to your everyday life.’ Sony continued that the module also has potential applications in sports or for work, to display useful information. The ‘sub-window’ connects to the frames of existing glasses and has been designed not to obstruct the wearer’s field of vision. And, because it is detachable, it can be removed when it’s not needed. Sony said it is hoping to start selling the module ‘within the coming year’, but will be unveiling a concept model at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Vegas in January. SLDM is fitted with a high-resolution, colour microdisplay, a micro-optical unit and a miniature control board (pictured) It is also looking to partner with eyewear manufacturers, sports and entertainment brands, and other electronic experts to make the device more widely available. Sony will also make the software development kits (SDK) available for developers to create apps, when the module is nearer to completion. This display module’s microdisplay measures 0.23-inches, with a resolution of 640 x 400 pixels. The display unit weighs around 40g - 22g for the display arm and 18g for the secondary arm. By comparison, Google Glass weighs 43g, and its display has a resolution of 640 × 360 pixels. Sony’s SLDM is fitted with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections, as well as an electronic compass, accelerometer and touch sensor. It is powered by an ARM Cortex-A7 Processor. There is no mention of an on-board camera on Sony's headset, which would put it at a disadvantage to Google’s model, fitted with a 5MP camera. ‘Many situations spring to mind in which hands-free display of information would be extremely beneficial,’ explained the firm. Sony said it is hoping to start selling the module (example uses are pictured) ‘within the coming year’ and will unveil a concept at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas in January. Sony will also make the software development kits (SDK) available for developers to create apps, when the module is nearer to completion .

"One of Bill Cosby's accusers has hit out at his family's claims that the comedian is the victim of unfounded accusations and a 'wonderful husband'. Yesterday Cosby's daughter Evin and his wife Camille  issued impassioned defences of the 77-year-old actor. However, Barbara Bowman, who alleges Cosby was 'like an animal' when he assaulted her in 1987, has now responded with a message directed at Cosby's wife. Scroll down for video . Barbara Bowman (pictured) claims Cosby was 'like an animal' when he attacked her in 1987 . Bill Cosby has been fiercely defended by his wife of more than 50 years. Camille (pictured with Cosby on November 6) claims he is the victim of unfounded allegations . Mrs Cosby has continued to stand by her husband in the past few months while more than a dozen women have come forward claiming he assaulted them. Bowman said she could not imagine the 'torment, anguish and deep disappointment' Mrs Cosby would be experiencing, Access Hollywood reported. She added: 'As she comes to terms with the raw reality of what her husband has caused as his partner of 50 years, she must be shedding tears for her family and for other families across this nation. Bill Cosby is not that man I thought I knew.' Since Bowman went public with her allegation to MailOnline, more than a dozen other women have come forward with allegations that include claims Cosby spiked their drinks before taking advantage of them. Bowman claimed she was 'drugged and raped' by him. She said: 'He is a monster. He came at me like a monster. My hope is that others who have experienced sexual abuse will not be intimidated into silence by the famous, rich and powerful. If I can help one victim, then I've done my job.' Camille (left) and Evin Cosby (centre) have staunchly defended the comedian despite more than a dozen woman claiming he assaulted them over a period of more than five decades . Bill Cosby's youngest daughter Evin is the latest member of the comedian's family to publicly address the mounting rape allegations made against the comedian in a short statement issued on Tuesday . Staunch defender: Camille Cosby, pictured with husband Bill in 2009, released a statement Monday defending him in the face of the numerous rape allegations against him . Cosby has yet to be charged and the allegations against him, which date as far back as the 1960s, are too old for most criminal charges or civil complaints. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, has called allegations against the trailblazing African-American comedian 'discredited' and 'defamatory.'

"Mark Walhberg's former bodyguard has revealed that he does not believe the star deserves a pardon for the violent assaults he committed in 1988. Leonard Taylor, who worked as an unpaid bodyguard for Wahlberg for three and a half years, said that he does not believe the actor has changed his ways, but 'he just has money now where he can cover it up'. Speaking to Page Six this week, he insisted: 'You can take Mark out of the trailer park, but you can't take the trailer park out of Mark.' Wahlberg as rapper Marky Mark in 1991, three years after the attack on Mr Trinh and a series of other crimes . Wahlberg, 43, is seeking a pardon from the state of Massachusetts for a racially-charged attack he committed as a 16-year-old, saying he is now 'a better person and citizen'. He insists he has come a long way since April 1988, when he attacked Thanh Lam with a five-foot stick while yelling slurs at him, before hitting a second man Hoa Trinh. In a separate incident, Taylor - who is African-American - claims Wahlberg attacked him outside a downtown Manhattan club in 2001. He said the star started the fight when he directed a racially insensitive remark at him. In a $2million civil lawsuit at the time, Taylor stated that Wahlberg punched him in the face and bit him on the arm - but he later dropped the suit and no criminal charges were filed. 'Mark liked to say things I think are inappropriate,' Taylor told Page Six. 'One minute he's laughing, the next he's looking at you with the evil eye. He goes from hot to cold real quick. There is no middle ground with him.' Taylor, who has battled drug addiction, depression and homelessness, added: 'I’m gonna be in my 70s telling people he attacked me. This is not about money, this is personal. I want to be a painful reminder of what he did.' Wahlberg, 43, is seeking a pardon from the state of Massachusetts for a racially-charged attack he committed as a 16-year-old, saying he is now 'a better person and citizen' Trinh, a Vietnam war veteran who fought in the anti-Communist South Vietnamese Army alongside US forces, has spoken out to say he would be willing to support Wahlberg's plea for a pardon. He told MailOnline: 'He was young and reckless but I forgive him now. 'Everyone deserves another chance. 'I would like to see him get a pardon. He should not have the crime hanging over him any longer.' Wahlberg, who served 45 days in jail after the 1988 assault, says his record continues to impact him and could prevent businesses, such as restaurants, that work with him from getting licenses. Documents included in his pardon request show he called the Vietnamese immigrant a 'Vietnam f***ing s***' before striking him so hard that the stick broke in two and knocked Lam unconscious, according to the documents shared by The Smoking Gun. Mark Wahlberg, pictured on Late Night with Seth Meyers last week, made no secret about his wayward teenage years . Trinh was assaulted by  Wahlberg in 1988. He has said he believes the actor should be allowed a fresh start . He then fled the scene and approached a second man, Hoa Trinh, put his arm around his shoulder and asked him to help him hide. But once police passed, Wahlberg hit him, leaving him blind in one eye. When Boston cops tracked Wahlberg down and took him back back to the scene of the assault outside a convenience store in Dorchester, he told officers: 'You don't have to let him identify me, I'll tell you now that's the motherf***** whose head I split open', the documents show. Authorities wrote that he also made 'numerous unsolicited racial statements about 'gooks' and ""slant-eyed gooks"".' In his plea, Wahlberg said that he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs at the time. 'From later accounts of the incident, it is my understanding that I may have caused serious injuries' to the men, he wrote. The liquor store where Wahlberg attacked one man with a stick and then ran away, before hitting another . Other documents show that, in an earlier attack in Dorchester, he and two friends saw a group of black siblings and chased them. 'We don't like black n****** in the area so get the f*** away from the area,' the boys shouted at the group, according to the documents. They then chased the boys, shouting: 'Kill the n*****, kill the n*****'. The following day, the group encountered one of the boys again and threw rocks at him. One of the rocks thrown by Wahlberg and one of his friends hit a nearby girl. The trio caused 'a high level of anxiety, fear and intimidation', the documents said. Though he was then only 16 at the time of the 1988 attack, he was charged as an adult and convicted of assault. According to NECN the initial charge was attempted murder. After emerging from prison, Wahlberg went on to find success in music with Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch and as a Calvin Klein model. But it was his appearance in the 1996 film Boogie Nights that really changed things, catapulting Wahlberg into the critically-acclaimed box office juggernaut that he is today. Mark Wahlberg and Rhea Durham attend 'The Gambler' premiere.  Wahlberg wants to become an LAPD reserve cop. But a felony conviction from his youth may block his attempt to become a volunteer . 'I am deeply sorry for the actions that I took on the night of April 8, 1988, as well as for any lasting damage that I may have caused the victims,' Wahlberg wrote in the pardon application. 'Since that time, I have dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that I can be a role model to my children and others.' He devotes much of his time and a large amount of his money to various charities, including the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation and the Dorchester Boys and Girls Club. He is also a family man now, married to former model Rhea Durham and the father of four children, and attends church daily. 'The more complex answer is that receiving a pardon would be a formal recognition that I am not the same person that I was on the night of April 8, 1988,' Wahlberg said. 'It would be formal recognition that someone like me can receive official public redemption if he devotes himself to personal improvement and a life of good works.' The Board of Pardons will investigate the petition to decide if it warrants a hearing before it is recommended to the governor who by that time will be the recently elected Charlie Baker.","Leonard Taylor said he does not believe the actor has changed his ways .

"A man was arrested after he opened the emergency exit on board a plane 'to get off quicker.' Shortly after the China Eastern flight MU2331 from Xi’an arrived at Sanya Fenghaung International Airport in Hainan, the impatient Chinese passenger made for an alternative exit out.

The man opened the emergency exit as he wanted to get off the plane quicker, and was then arrested . When asked why he had broken the rules, the passenger replied by saying he had 'wanted to get off the plane quicker.' He also claimed he had not listened to the in-flight instructions, saying that he was not aware you couldn't use the emergency exit to disembark.

The incident comes only days after a Chinese woman scalded a flight attendant by throwing a cup of hot noodles after finding out she wouldn't be sat next to her boyfriend. The incident occurred on a charter flight from Bangkok to Nanjing, China, and passengers were on hand to pull out their smartphones as the mid-air drama unfolded in front of them, snapping pictures as the injured flight attendant covered her face and shouted in pain. During the chaos a man believed to be the woman's boyfriend jumped out of his seat and angrily threatened to blow up the plane as the injured flight attendant was tended to by her co-workers.

"Smokers who use e-cigarettes are likely to stop or reduce their smoking, claims an independent review of trial data. Almost one in 10 smokers using e-cigarettes had been able to quit the habit up to a year later, and around one-third had cut down. The review of two trials is published today in The Cochrane Library, the world’s leading producer of systematic reviews. Controversy continues over whether e-cigarettes have net benefits, amid fears that using them in public places will ‘re-normalise’ smoking, especially among young people, and reverse declining smoking rates. The independent review of two trials has revealed almost one in 10 smokers using e-cigarettes had been able to quit the habit up to a year later, and around a third had cut down . Professor Peter Hajek of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies at QMUL, co-author of the review, said smokers wanting to quit who had failed using conventional aids such as patches should try buying e cigarettes. The trial data showed no serious adverse effects from short to medium term use, he said. ‘Although our confidence in the effects of electronic cigarettes as smoking cessation interventions is limited because of the small number of trials, the results are encouraging’ he said. Around 2.1 million Britons use battery-powered e-cigarettes - devices allowing users to inhale nicotine while avoiding the harm caused by tobacco smoke. It is estimated that two thirds are current smokers, many of who are trying to quit, and most of the remainder are ex-smokers. The UK’s drug watchdog has decided they must be regulated as medicines to make the products ‘safer and more effective’ but this won’t happen until 2016. In Wales, health legislators are consulting on plans to make the principality the first part of the UK to ban e-cigarettes in enclosed public places. Some countries have banned them altogether including Norway, Singapore, Brazil, along with Western Australia. The World Health Organisation claimed in August that the devices pose a risk to bystanders through emissions of ‘toxicant’ substances and warned of limited evidence they help people quit smoking. The Cochrane review looked at two trials involving 662 current smokers, and 11 observational studies. Some experts fear e-cigs act as a gateway to smoking in younger people, who might not have started smoking otherwise (file picture) About nine per cent of smokers who used e-cigarettes were able to stop smoking at up to one year, compared with four per cent of those in the trial using nictotine-free e-cigarettes. The researchers found 36 per cent of e-cigarette users halved the number of conventional cigarettes they used, compared with 28 per cent getting the nicotine-free alternative. Professor Hajek said critics who claimed e-cigarettes might contain some toxins should realise they are not being compared with ‘fresh air’ but the known harms of conventional cigarettes. The furore over e-cigarettes and unexpected opposition from some quarters, including public health doctors, was possibly due to it being a ‘disruptive technology’, he said. It threatens vested interests, from tobacco manufacturers to those with ‘established public health positions’ he added. Professor Robert West, editor-in-chief of Addiction and Director of Tobacco Research at University College London, said: ‘This study tells us that even the older style electronic cigarettes improve smokers’ chances of stopping by about 50 per cent. ‘It’s early days but so far it seems that these devices are already helping tens of thousands of smokers to stop each year.’ Dr John Middleton, vice president for Policy at the Faculty of Public Health said: ‘Our position remains that while e-cigarettes may help smokers who want to quit, we don’t yet have enough evidence yet of the impact they are having on other people, particularly children and smokers who also use e-cigarettes. ‘There’s good evidence that most people start smoking in their teens and that the most effective way to stop smoking is through NHS quit smoking services. ‘It has taken decades of sustained effort to create a society in the UK where smoking is now not seen as the norm. ‘Our concern is that e-cigarettes could reverse this and create a new generation of customers for the tobacco industry, who might otherwise not have started smoking.’","Review of two trials found one in 10 smokers using e-cigs quit a year later .

"Dawood Ibrahim is counting his blessings after his alarm clock failed to work yesterday - because it meant he overslept and avoided getting caught up in the massacre at his school in Pakistan. The 15-year-old is now the only member of class 9 left at the Army Public School in Peshawar after terrorists slaughtered every one of his classmates. His story came to light after a tweet appeared that read 'there is no class 9 in APS anymore... Dawood, 15, is the only survivor'. Scroll down for videos . Tragic: Dawood Ibrahim is the only member of class 9 left. He didn't go to school on the morning of the attack because his alarm didn't go off . His older brother, Sufyan Ibrahim, confirmed his remarkable escape to The Express Tribune of Pakistan. He said: 'It was fate. No one from his class survived. Every single one of them was killed.' It's believed that his class may have been murdered by one of the gunmen detonating a suicide vest. Dawood spent yesterday attending funerals, his brother added - having been at a wedding the night before. Meanwhile, horrifying accounts from child survivors of the Pakistan school massacre continued to emerge - including one who was sprayed with the 'warm blood and flesh' of his friends as gunmen opened fire during a first-aid class. Their horrendous ordeals came as the first devastating images emerged today of the blood-soaked classrooms where 132 innocent children and nine teachers were massacred by the Taliban at an army-run school in Peshawar. Ehsan Elahi, 13, told how he survived by playing dead after being shot twice in the arm as militants 'sprayed bullets like hell' into his class, turning the room into a 'pool of blood and death'. Speaking to MailOnline from his hospital bed, the eight-grade pupil said he was being taught first aid by army instructors in the main hall when he heard the sound of gunfire drawing nearer. He said: 'Our teachers and instructors asked us to calm down but the sound of the bullets started came closer and closer. 'In the next minute, the glass of windows and doors of the hall smashed with bullets. Some people started kicking the hall doors.' He said that situation created panic among the 100 students in the hall. He said: 'Everybody was trying to find a place to hide but there was not such places in the hall. 'The students were crying and weeping. 'There were only chairs and benches to hide behind in the hall. I jumped behind a bench and laid on the ground.' He said the attackers burst in and started 'spraying bullets like hell'. Elahi continued: 'I saw army instructors falling on the ground first. I saw many of my friends getting bullets on their heads, chests, arms and legs right in front of me. 'Their body parts and blood were flying like small pieces of cotton in the class room. 'Warm blood and flesh of my friends fell on my face and other parts of my body. It was horrible. 'They kept on firing bullets for at least 10 minutes and then stopped. It was a pause of a maximum of a minute. 'Next moment, they started spraying bullets again towards those who were crying with pain or moving. I also received two bullets on my right arm. 'I did not cry because it meant death': Ehsan Elahi survived by playing dead after being shot twice in the arm when Taliban militants stormed his first-aid class, massacring his friends and army instructors . 'Blood, flesh and body parts were scattered every where': Ehsan Elahi (centre) saw the 'lifeless faces of his friends' as he fled the hall during the massacre . 'I wanted to cry with my full voice but I held my pain and did not cry because it meant death.' Elahi explained how his life was eventually saved by Pakistani soldiers. He said: 'They were not ready to leave alive even a single person present in the hall. After around 15 minutes, we heard some bullets shots from outside. 'I think army soldiers reached the school by that time and they fired those bullets. This diverted the attention of the attackers. 'They ran out from the hall. But, I did not move or cried for next 10 minutes unless army men came to rescue us. Devastation: Mrs Kazi's office, where a terrorist blew himself up during a nine-hour rampage . Shocking: The scene of the final gun battle between the jihadists and Pakistani soldiers . Harrowing: A blood-splattered doorway leading to an auditorium at the school in Peshawar, with spectacles on the floor belonging to one of the victims of the massacre . Chairs are upturned and blood stains the floor at the Army Public School auditorium . 'The hall has turned to pool of blood and death. Human blood, flesh and body parts were scattered every where. 'I saw lifeless faces of many of my friends when I was leaving the hall. Their faces are still in front of my eyes.' Another pupil told how he watched his female teacher being burned alive as she courageously stood in the path of the terrorists and told her children to run for their lives. Afsha Ahmed, 24, confronted the marauding gunmen when they burst into her classroom and told them: 'You can only kill my students over my dead body.' The militants doused her with petrol and set her alight, but she still mustered the strength to beckon her pupils to flee. One of her students, 15-year-old Irfan Ullah, wept as he recalled her incredible bravery. Tahira Kazi (left), the principal of the Army Public School and College in Peshawar, was set on fire by jihadists who slaughtered 142 people, most of them children . It is believed Mrs Kazi (right) was targeted because she's married to a retired army colonel, Kazi Javaid . He said: 'She was a hero, so brave. She jumped up and stood between us and the terrorists before they could target us. 'She warned them: ""You can only kill them over my dead body"". I remember her last words - she said: ""I won't see my students lying in blood on the floor"".' Irfan, who suffered serious injuries to his chest and stomach in the chaos, said he hoped Mrs Ahmed would forgive him for not trying to protect her and for any mistakes he ever made in class. 'I felt so selfish as we ran away to safe our lives instead of trying to save our teacher who sacrificed her life for our better tomorrow,' he added. Meanwhile, horrifying pictures have revealed the carnage wrought by seven extremist gunmen who sprayed children with bullets as they sat receiving first aid tuition and exploded suicide bombs in a room of 60 pupils. As the Pakistani city of Peshawar began the harrowing process of conducting mass funerals, the family of a teacher torched alive in front of her class gathered to say funeral prayers. Tahira Kazi, the principal of the Army Public School and College in Peshawar, was set on fire by jihadists who slaughtered so many. It is believed she was targeted because she is married to a retired army colonel, Kazi Zafrullah. The picture obtained by MailOnline shows her standing proudly next to a student believed to be her son. Today the Pakistani prime minister lifted a moratorium on the death penalty, as the school reopened to reveal the terrifying aftermath of the atrocity, including Mrs Kazi's office, where a terrorist blew himself up. The masscre led to calls for the death penalty to be restored. 'It was decided that this moratorium should be lifted. The prime minister approved,' said government spokesman Mohiuddin Wan, referring to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's approval of the decision by a ministerial committee.","Dawood Ibrahim, 15, was fortunate to escape the Peshawar massacre .

"The Obamas, pictured last week, spoke candidly in an interview about their experiences of racism . The Obamas revealed their first-hand encounters with racism as they spoke candidly about tough questions America is facing over race. The President and First Lady recalled a time when Barack was handed car keys to fetch the vehicle at valet-parking, while he waited outside a restaurant after dinner. In a joint interview, Michelle Obama told People this month that prior to holding the most powerful position in the U.S., her husband faced his share of prejudice. She said: 'Before that, Barack Obama was a black man that lived on the South Side of Chicago, who had his share of troubles catching cabs.' She said that even when she went to Target as First Lady, a fellow shopper had asked her to get something from a shelf. Mrs Obama said: 'Even as the First Lady - during that wonderfully publicized trip I took to Target, not highly disguised, the only person who came up to me in the store was a woman who asked me to help her take something off a shelf.' She added: 'These incidents in the black community, this is the regular course of life. These are the challenges that we still face as a country.' Of her husband, Mrs Obama added that during one event: 'He was wearing a tuxedo at a black-tie dinner, and somebody asked him to get coffee.' Scroll down for video . First Lady Michelle Obama, wearing a hat and sunglasses, center, stands in line at a Target Department store in Alexandria, Virginia in 2011. Mrs Obama told People this month that even when she went to Target as First Lady, a fellow shopper asked her to get something from a shelf . The President said racial relations have gotten better, but more progress is needed. 'The small irritations or indignities that we experience are nothing compared to what a previous generation experienced,' Obama said. 'It's one thing for me to be mistaken for a waiter at a gala. 'It's another thing for my son to be mistaken for a robber and to be handcuffed, or worse, if he happens to be walking down the street and is dressed the way teenagers dress.' The Obamas' remarks follow months of tense protests across the country as America faces up to burning questions about race relations following the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Eric Garner in New York at the hands of the police. The President said basketball superstar LeBron James did the right thing when he wore an 'I can't breathe' T-shirt - referring to the chokehold death of Mr Garner - on to the court. He told People: 'I think LeBron did the right thing. We forget the role that Muhammad Ali, Arthur Ashe and Bill Russell played in raising consciousness. 'I'd like to see more athletes do that - not just around this issue, but around a range of issues.' Obama agreed with basketball star LeBron James wearing an 'I can't breathe' T-shirt in protest of Eric Garner's chokehold death by an NYPD cop, on the basketball court in New York . Following the death of Michael Brown, a black teen who was unarmed when shot dead by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri, Obama met with young people from the area. He told them to express in peaceful ways what was going on in their lives - but cautioned them not to think all problems could be solved in the short-term. The Obamas said now their daughters, Malia, 16, and 13-year-old Sasha were older, the family were able to discuss more difficult questions facing the African-American community. Mrs Obama said: 'When you're raising black kids you have to talk about these issues, because they're real.' The President said they try to get Malia and Sasha to reflect on stereotypes, particularly on 'how they think they should have to act as African-American girls'. He added that following the cases of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin: 'Around the dinner table we're pointing out to them that too often in our society black boys are still perceived as more dangerous, and it will be part of their generation's task to try to eradicate those stereotypes.' The President also spoke about his feelings of nostalgia about Christmases past now that their daughters are teens. The President told People: 'Kids don't want toys now. They want iTunes cards.' The Obamas also shared intimate moments from White House life - including a secret dance party that took place in the Yellow Oval Room. Do you think the Obamas have been victims of racism? Do you think the Obamas have been victims of racism? Now share your opinion . On one recent Friday evening when the Obamas had a small group of friends over, Barack acted as DJ and they cranked the music up in a room that is more used to hosting visiting royal dignitaries. Obama shared his top playlist for getting people on the dance floor with People magazine. 'We started with Aretha’s Rock Steady. Sly and the Family Stone.' the President said. 'Then we ended the night on Al Green, and everybody did a slow dance.' The first couple's love of music and dancing is well-known, and while the commander-in-chief may only be spinning the decks behind closed doors, he was recently seen grooving with Santa Claus at the lighting of the National Christmas tree in D.C. The interviews comes just a few days before the Obamas are set to jet off on their annual vacation to Hawaii for almost three weeks. The first family will leave Washington, D.C. on Friday for the President's native state and won't return until January 4, the White House said. It is not yet known where they stay this year, though they have traditionally rented out a property on Oahu island.

"Hillary Rodham Clinton is the early frontrunner in the 2016 presidential election, a poll has said. Although the former Secretary of State has yet to announce her candidacy, 50 per cent of American voters have said they can see themselves supporting her if she runs. Mrs Clinton, 67, has said she will make her decision on whether or not to run for the White House 2016 early next year. Scroll down for video . Frontrunner: Half of American voters would support Hillary Rodham Clinton for president if she decides to run for office in 2016, a poll has found . The poll found that half of voters support another Clinton president, while 48 per cent oppose it. Despite only a small margin of support, hers is significantly stronger than that of any rumoured Republican nominees. One reason for this could be that Ms Clinton, a former first lady and New York senator  is viewed as the likely Democratic nominee if she runs with few other candidates seen as competition. This becomes clear when polling only Democratic voters, where 82 per cent said they could see themselves supporting her if she runs, and only 15 per cent saying they cannot. One likely Republican opponent Jeb Bush, who announced that he is 'actively exploring' running for President 2016, only has a 31 per cent support, the poll by NBC News/Wall Street Journal said. Big support: Hillary Rodham Clinton, pictured  at the 2014 Robert F. Kennedy Ripple Of Hope Awards yesterday, has and 82 per cent approval rate among Democratic voters . Winner, winner: Despite her overwhelming support from Democrats, the former Secretary of State has said she will not announce whether she is running until early 2015 . Age: 67 . Spouse: Bill Clinton (m. 1975) Children: Chelsea Clinton . Most recent occupation: Secretary of State . Previous: U.S. Senator for New York, First Lady . Democratic Credentials: Pushed for broad health care reforms known as Hillarycare . Backers: Ready for Hillary, Correct the Record . Best known for: 2008 presidential campaign; married to a former Commander in Chief; Benghazi . Says of 2016: 'I'll decide on 2016 presidential bid early next year.' Republican nominee 2012 Mitt Romney fared marginally better with 33 per cent saying they could see themselves supporting him. However, 57 percent say they could not support Jeb Bush, the younger brother of George W., while a full 60 per cent said they would not be backing Romney. Mr Bush took one step further towards the Republican nominee contest yesterday when he announced on Facebook that he will he will 'actively explore the possibility of running'. Many, both rivals and experts, saw his statement as a de facto announcement that ends months of speculation about his intentions. The son and brother of presidents, 61-year-old Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is the early favorite of the Republican establishment wing. His move puts immediate pressure on other establishment-minded GOP contenders to start competing with him for donors, campaign staff and national attention in a crowded field of potential contenders. Eyes on the prize: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush  took his most definitive step yet toward running for president oin Tuesday, announcing plans to 'actively explore' a campaign . In a race likely to include fiery conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Bush will occupy the middle ground despite his overwhelmingly conservative record as Florida's chief executive from 1999 to 2007. He also gives his party a powerful tool for courting the nation's surging Hispanic population. Bush is married to a Mexican-American, speaks Spanish and has been among the GOP's most outspoken advocates for an immigration overhaul, including a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are living in the country illegally. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren again said yesterday that she's not running for president, regardless of pleas from the progressive base for her to seek the Democratic nomination in 2016. 'You know, I'm just here to stand up for hardworking families who just want a fighting chance. 'That's what I'm in this fight for, and I'm in this fight all the way,' Warren told National Public Radio yesterday morning. The left-wing politician was careful not to say that she was 'never' running, however, leaving open the possibility of a future candidacy - potentially sooner than she's letting on publicly.","Hillary Rodham Clinton has the support of half of American voters .

"The father of an adopted Chinese girl who was brought over to the United States as an infant has called on school authorities to discover whether racist bullying caused his daughter to take her own life. Mark Olsen of Fairfield Township, Ohio believes his daughter Emilie Grace Olsen, 13, may have been bullied at school.

Speaking to Cincinnati.com, Mr Olsen said: 'I'm not saying the school did something wrong, but I am looking for answers. 'I'm not trying to stir the pot, and I know there are a lot of rumors out there, but I'm trying to get answers.' Several posts on social media suggested that the 13-year-old school girl had been racially bullied. He said: 'There was a racial component to the bullying. There was cyber-bullying and physical bullying. They (school officials) cleared it up in the sixth grade, but it continued into the seventh grade. She was an A student, but she started to fail intentionally and talked about wanting to go to another school district to get away from it.'

Emilie Grace was as student of Fairfield Middle School who denied there had been any racial element to the tragedy. School spokeswoman Gina Gentry-Fletcher described Emilie Grace's death a a tragedy and said the school was making counselors available to students. She said there were a number of 'rumors and misinformation' surrounding the tragedy. She said an earlier bullying allegation concerning Emilie Grace had been resolved. However, Mr Olsen later told WCPO.com: 'I want to believe them ... I spoke to the principal this morning. He called me back. I believe what he told me, however, I'm getting conflicting stories. 'I believe there is something more to it and that's what I want to find out.'

"Tech giant Apple has halted sales of iPhones, iPads and other products in Russia, saying the country's currency is too volatile for it to set prices. The value of the rouble has collapsed this week, losing 20 per cent of its value against the dollar at one point yesterday, after a dramatic decision to raise interest rates sparked investor panic. The Central Bank of Russia hiked interest rates from 10.5 to 17 per cent in a desperate effort to prop up the currency yesterday, but the move instead lead to financial meltdown. Scroll down for video . Money worries: Vladimir Putin is facing the toughest test of his leadership yet as the Russian currency goes into 'free-fall' prompting Apple to suspend sales of its products . Customers in Russia are unable to buy iPhones, iPads or other Apple items online today as the company said it cannot set prices while the rouble's value is so volatile . The crisis could weaken President Vladimir Putin’s iron grip on power as analysts warned the currency was in ‘free-fall’. Apple has already raised its prices by 20 per cent this year after a slide in the rouble's value since January left its products cheaper in Russia compared with elsewhere in Europe. Central bank officials today revealed they have spent $2billion intervening in the currency market since Monday, and have spent $80billion since the start of the year. ‘Russia is in a full-blown currency crisis,’ said Alexander Moseley, a fund manager at Schroders, the asset management firm. Harry Adams, managing director of the foreign exchange specialist Argentex, said the rouble had turned to ‘rubble’. The rouble has fallen by nearly 60 per cent against the dollar this year on the back of the tumbling oil price and worries about the outlook for the Russian economy. Oil and gas account for 70 per cent of Russian exports and half of government revenues, making the country vulnerable to falling prices. Crude fell below $59 a barrel yesterday for the first time since May 2009, having traded at $115 as recently as June. Fighting: The surprise announcement comes after the rouble's value has sunk roughly 50 per cent since January - battered by Western sanctions imposed over the Ukraine conflict (pictured) The lower oil price and sanctions imposed on Russia by the West for its land grab in Ukraine have left its fragile economy on the brink of recession. A one point yesterday, a dollar was worth nearly 80 roubles – compared with around 30 at the start of the year – rekindling memories of Russia’s 1998 financial crisis, when the currency collapsed and the country was forced to default on its debts. The current crisis has piled pressure on Mr Putin. ‘The pieces are falling into place to start to affect the political sustainability of this regime,’ said Nicholas Spiro, of the London consultancy Spiro Sovereign Strategy. Russia’s central bank predicts that the economy will contract by 4.5 per cent in 2015 if oil prices average $60 a barrel throughout the year. The slump in the rouble has driven inflation above 9 per cent by making imports more expensive, and this will hit families and businesses. Sergei Shvetsov, deputy governor of the central bank, said in Moscow yesterday: ‘I couldn’t imagine even a year ago that such a thing would happen, even in my wildest dreams. The situation is critical.’ Lavrov insisted: 'I can assure you that Russia will not only survive but we will come out stronger. We have been in much worse situations in our history and every time, we got out of those fixes much stronger. This will happen this time.' Turmoil: Putin was facing a serious crisis last night after the Russian rouble crashed through the floor, it hit 80 to the dollar, 100 to the euro, and 113 to the Pound at one point and lost 20 per cent in a matter of hours . Overnight, Russia had dramatically raised its interest rate from 10.5 to 17 per cent  in a desperate effort to prevent the collapse of the rouble and boost its stricken economy. The surprise announcement was made at 1am Moscow time and comes after the rouble's value has sunk roughly 50 per cent since January - battered by plunging worldwide oil prices and Western sanctions imposed over the conflict in Ukraine. The move is Russia' largest single rise since 1998, when interest rates soared past 100 per cent and the government defaulted on debt. Russia's economy is threatened by paralysis as the tumbling value of its currency pushes inflation to dangerous levels. The overnight action has somewhat allayed fears, however, prompting an immediate gain in the rouble and leaving it 1.6 per cent up on the Asian stock market. The Bank of Russia's aggressive move illustrated the size of the economic perils confronting Russia and reflected fears that the ruble's decline could trigger consumer panic and incite a run on banks. Russian interest rate: A desperate last-minute hike in interest rates to 17 per cent failed to halt the collapse . By raising interest rates, the central bank hopes investors will find it more financially appealing to keep their money in Russia rather than moving it to Western Europe, Asia or the United States. 'They did it as a lure to encourage people to keep their rubles at home rather than continue to flee the currency and the country,' said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California. 'It's a way of buying time. It doesn't solve any of the underlying issues that the Russian economy has,' he added, referring to falling energy prices, Western sanctions and widespread corruption. Such challenges are especially difficult because Russia's economy relies so heavily on petroleum revenue and lacks the diversification to withstand severe economic downturns. That tends to leave Russia at the mercy of global financial markets, where oil is priced in dollars. The average price of a barrel of oil has dropped below $56 from a summer high of $107. Historic: The move is Russia' largest single rise since 1998, when interest rates soared past 100 per cent, the government defaulted on debt, and people queued on Moscow's streets to withdraw their savings (pictured) The Russian government recently downgraded its growth forecast for next year, predicting that the economy will sink into recession. Still, the Bank of Russia's latest action carries dangers of its own. By jacking up rates to try to contain inflation, it risks inflicting further economic damage, Eichengreen noted. Though high interest rates can attract investor money, they can also stifle growth by making it harder for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend. Vital: The Russian economy is reliant on the price of oil extracted from its Siberian rigs (pictured) The announcement in Moscow came after U.S. and European markets had closed. Stocks have suffered in recent days amid the steady drop in global oil prices. The sell-off could continue if investors view the Bank of Russia's move as ineffective. The central bank has gradually raised the rate from 5.5 per cent early this year to 17 per cent now. Last Thursday, it tried unsuccessfully to stem the ruble's slide by boosting its key rate by 1 per cent point to 10.5 per cent. It cited a surge in consumer prices and a 'significant inflation risk.' The Bank of Russia said then that it expected prices to rise 10 percent for 2014 and climb further in the first quarter of 2015. But the ruble plunged further yesterday, dropping from 55 rubles to the dollar on Thursday to about 65 rubles to the dollar by the close of the markets last night. A falling currency increases the cost of imports, stoking inflationary pressures. At the same time, plunging oil prices limit the government's ability to fight a downturn and forces it to borrow more. The sanctions imposed by the West have magnified Russia's economic turmoil. In September, the United States and the European Union announced a new round of sanctions over Moscow's involvement in Ukraine, which included blocking Western financial markets to key Russian companies and limiting imports of some technologies. The additional sanctions were expected to cause enough pain to put Russia into recession for one or two years, predicted economist Alexei Kudrin, who served as finance minister under President Vladimir Putin for 11 years until 2011. The potential for a prolonged downturn caused investors to pull their money from the country, causing the ruble to further lose value.","Russian crisis deepens as Apple stops sales while rouble is in 'free-fall'

"As the world's highest-paid DJ Calvin Harris is usually hidden behind the decks of a super club, but now the Grammy-winning Scot has stepped out from behind the turntables to be unveiled as the face and body of fashion label Emporio Armani. The handsome 30-year old seems totally at ease in front of the camera in campaign shots released today, showing off his buff body, long legs and blue steel pout. In fact, he wouldn't look out of place in a male model line-up, but when exactly did this happen? When did Calvin Harris get so damn hot?! DJ Calvin Harris has been unveiled as the face of Emporio Armani for next season . The Scottish Grammy-winner is seen modelling clothing and accessories in stylish new campaign shots . Because the 6ft 5in music man hasn't always been quite so polished. Back in 2007, as he released his debut album I Created Disco, Dumfries-born Calvin - whose real name is Adam Wiles - was a pale and scruffy brunette who favoured a battered leather jacket, hooded tops and loose jeans. But roll on a few years and the award-winning producer, who is signed to music company Three Six Zero, has ditched the hair dye, hired a stylist and started working out. A lot. In the name of investigative journalism we have traced Calvin's transformation from so-so to super fit. Calvin has morphed from gawky twenty-something to a suave 30-year-old in the last seven years . Living in LA seems to have helped: 'The food is fantastic over here. You can eat healthily, there’s a lot more healthy options than in the UK — that’s a fact.' he told The Sun when he moved there in 2012. His daily routine now involves eggs for breakfast ('egg-white omelette with smoked salmon and spinach for protein, fibre and omega-3') and a trip to the gym before hitting the studio. Calvin has also learned to love his height. In the past the lofty chart-topper has admitted to being bullied at school for being different: 'It was hard being the tallest person in class. Especially when you are a teenager. You want to keep your head down. I did anyway.When you are a spotty awkward teenager, you don't want people to look at you. It's a self-conscious thing. Everyone looks at you because you are extra gangly. It's only in the last five years that I have come to terms with the fact that I am a big tall b******.' he said in 2009. The DJ shared this six-pack snap on Twitter on Tuesday with the caption 'Need more stepladders #Armani #BehindTheScenes #LaughingAboutSomething,' Other photographs shared by the artist showed off a toned chest and perfectly coiffed hair . But the biggest difference to Calvin's look has been embracing his natural blonde hair in 2012. 'I just don’t have time for that s*** any more in my life, and as I approach 30, I don’t think it’s a good thing for a man to be doing,' he said at the time. 'It’s just part of growing up, coming to terms with myself as a human being and not doing that s*** any more. I prefer my more natural look. If anyone doesn’t, they’d be preferring something that isn’t actually real — so it’s like you’re preferring an imaginary idea of someone who doesn’t exist. You either like it or you don’t like it.' We like it Calvin, we like it a lot. 2007 (left) Practising the moody music pose in London and 2009 (right) ring-flashed and a bit more polished (but still in the same jacket) 2010 (left) arriving at the Brit Awards in an arty T and 2011 (right) looking very slim at O2s Jingle Bell Ball . 2012 (left) he's ditched the hair dye at the MTV VMAs and 2013 (right) back at the Brits but this time looking super slick in a fitted suit . 2014 Performing at the Jingle Ball in New York this December.

Designer Giorgio Armani says of the DJ: 'Calvin Harris is a truly cosmopolitan, dynamic young man who is capable of attracting the masses with his music and energy. He isn't a model by nature, and this creates a more sincere and engaging bond with the public.' This lucky lady is model Aarika Wolf who is the first women that the musician has been publicly linked with since splitting from Rita Ora ealier this summer. It is understood Calvin met the 21-year-old American model after she was cast as one of a number of lingerie-clad women for his Blame music video filmed in August .","Scottish DJ Calvin Harris released his debut album I Created Disco in 2007 .

"The U.S. Olympic Committee will try to land the 2024 Olympics and end a 28-year drought without the Summer Games. Which city will it pick? Stay tuned. After hearing presentations from the four candidates Tuesday — Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington — USOC board members voted to join the race, but not until they have a chance to mull over the candidates during the holidays. 'It's a four-way tie,' CEO Scott Blackmun said, not diverging from the federation's closed-lip policy on this yearlong selection process. 'We had great presentations, now we have an opportunity to explore how everyone felt about the presentations. We'll reflect, come back after the holidays and see what's in the best interest for the United States.' Tight-lipped: USOC chairman Larry Probst (left) and USOC chief executive officer Scott Blackmun (right) address the media in a press conference following the USOC board of directors meeting at Hotel Sofitel San Francisco which revealed the US will vie to host the 2024 Olympics. They stayed mum on which city would put in the bid . This was the expected move from a federation that lost badly the last two times it bid for the Games — New York for 2012 and Chicago for 2016 — and hasn't played host to the Summer Olympics since the Atlanta Games in 1996. The 2016 Olympics are set for Rio de Janeiro. The 2020 Games, which the United States did not bid for, will be in Tokyo. America's chosen city for 2024 will be up against Rome and either Hamburg or Berlin. There will be others in the mix, as well, possibly including Paris, which is expected to announce its intention soon. The Games will be awarded in 2017. 'There are some real good cities lining up,' said Steve Penny, president of USA Gymnastics. 'It's going to be a tough race. It's important to take the time to make the right decision, to find a city that represents a very bold message.' Blackmun said there were no major changes in the decision-making process that stemmed from the International Olympic Committee's Agenda 2020 — an attempt to streamline the bidding process and make the Olympics less expensive. He and chairman Larry Probst said there was no move to have two cities combine on a bid — a possibility raised in Agenda 2020. All the cities had their mayors or mayor-elects there, along with the bids' power players. They included Giants owner Larry Baer for San Francisco, agent and media mogul Casey Wasserman for Los Angeles, construction magnate John Fish for Boston and Wizards and Capitals owner Ted Leonsis for Washington. 'Four-way tie': San Francisco is among the cities vying to host the games. The city is one of four in the U.S. hoping to outbid Hamburg or Berlin, Rome and possibly Paris . Boston also wants to play host to the Olympics, though a movement in protest of the bid has grown quickly in the city . 'We're not going to leave a bill for future generations,' Boston Mayor Marty Walsh told The Associated Press, hammering home a theme of cost-effectiveness that the USOC has insisted on from the start of this process. Also represented was the group No Boston Olympics, the most organized protest group in the four cities, which unfurled a banner outside the meeting place in Redwood City, California. The group cited polling data that showed tepid support, along with the secretive process of the domestic selection process, as among the reasons to reject the Olympics. Blackmun said the protest groups won't scare the USOC. 'Once we pick a city and the city has more freedom (to outline details of its bid), I think you'll see opposition decline,' he said. 'You'll see that each bid is fiscally responsible.' The cities all came in with projected operating budgets of between $4 billion and $5 billion, though that cost almost always skyrockets, and doesn't include the infrastructure and other Olympic-related improvements cities make. Blackmun said the cities had to show how an Olympics would fit into their long-term plans — an element the IOC also thinks is important as it tries to end the days of billion-dollar roads, stadiums and airports that are only partially used once the Olympics leave town. Also important to the U.S. bid is the USOC's reputation overseas. Blackmun and Probst have spent more than four years traveling the world to repair frayed relations that played into the country's last two losses. 'They've done a tremendous job,' said Max Siegel, CEO of USA Track and Field. 'They've been consistent, deliberate, invested in building meaningful relationships. Where we operate, I think people are noticing there's a genuine effort to be a contributing member.' Los Angeles wants to host the games for the third time in 2024--having hosted in 1932 as well as 1984 .","The U.S. cities will be up against Hamburg or Berlin, Rome and possibly Paris for the games .
