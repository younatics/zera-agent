"(CNN)Here's a roundup of five medical studies published this week that might give you new insights into your health. Remember, correlation is not causation -- so if a study finds a connection between two things, it doesn't mean that one causes the other. Dream on and it'll get weird . At the beginning of your sleep cycle, you may be dreaming about grocery shopping or your favorite TV show. But by the end of the night, you more likely will be dreaming about doing that shopping in your underwear with a murderous clown following you. In a study in the American Psychological Association journal, scientists followed the dream patterns of 16 people over two nights. The dreamers were awakened four times a night and asked to describe their dreams. The researchers found the longer someone slept the stranger and more emotional and in-depth their dreams got. Scientists concluded that a particular time of night may affect the content of dreams. A new way to detect depression . Currently, a doctor or social worker will ask you a standard set of questions to determine if you are depressed. Depression is often underdiagnosed because studies have shown patients frequently underreport their symptoms. Scientists at Northwestern University have come up with an alternative way to diagnose depression that uses a blood test, according to a study from Translational Psychiatry. The blood test looks at nine genetic markers in the blood that have been linked to depression. Scientists tried the test on 32 adults who were diagnosed as depressed and 32 who were not. After 18 weeks of therapy, those who were considered depressed were tested again. Those who improved through therapy showed a change in their genetic markers. The accuracy of the blood test showed similar results to people who were diagnosed through diagnostic interviews. Could a blood test predict suicides? American beer bellies are getting bigger . Americans are getting bigger around the middle, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. That's considered the most dangerous place on the body to gain weight. Studies have shown that people whose weight settles in their midsections have a higher risk for diabetes, heart disease and other serious conditions. In this study, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at adults over a period of 12 years. They found that the average waist size went up nearly an inch for men, to almost 40 inches. For women, the average waistline was about 38 inches, which is up nearly an inch and a half from 2000. By the CDC's estimates, 54% of U.S. adults are heavier in their midsections. That's up from 46% in 1999-2000. The average body mass index, or BMI, has stayed steady. Illicit drug use among teens is down slightly . Fewer teens are using illicit drugs and binge drinking, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which was released in full this week. About 8.8% of teens 12 to 17 reported using illegal drugs in the survey, a decrease of 13% from 2009 and 24% from 2002. Fewer teens also reported drinking in the month before completing the survey. Around 6.2% reported binge drinking. Even marijuana use among teens was down slightly. Researchers did not see a change in the number of people over 12 who were using pain relievers for nonmedical purposes. Around 4.5 million Americans admitted to doing so, a rate similar to those in 2011 and 2012. Gupta: How we created the heroin problem . A link between artificial sweeteners and diabetes . Artificial sweeteners may be messing with our gut bacteria and, in turn, with our ability to tolerate glucose. Glucose intolerance is a condition that can lead to diabetes. The series of studies appeared this week in the journal Nature. Scientists found that when mice ate or drank liquid or food made from aspartame, saccharin or sucralose, many of them became glucose intolerant. Researchers then tested the same thing out in seven human volunteers. Four of the seven developed glucose intolerance after consuming a regular dose of saccharin for a week. These individuals were not regular users of artificial sweeteners before the experiment. In a separate study of 400 humans, the scientists noticed the gut bacteria in study participants changed after they consumed artificial sweeteners. Gut bacteria are different in everyone. But some experts believe our gut bacteria can affect how our body processes food and burns calories. They theorize that the way sweeteners react with gut bacteria may affect whether someone gains or loses weight.","Average BMI has stayed the same for Americans, but our waist size is expanding .

"Rita Taylor's heart used to break every time she put her two young daughters to bed. For five years, Taylor and her children were homeless, sometimes sleeping in abandoned houses or cars. When they finally moved into a home of their own, they had nothing to put in it, and Taylor's girls were sleeping on the floor. ""As a mother, I felt like I let my kids down, and that bothered me,"" Taylor said. ""I felt like I was failing my kids."" When a friend referred Taylor to an organization called A Wider Circle, all that changed. The D.C.-area nonprofit helps furnish the homes of impoverished families -- for free. ""There's no stability and there's no dignity when you live in apartments that have nothing in them,"" said Mark Bergel, the organization's founder. Since 2001, Bergel and his group have assisted more than 125,000 people throughout Washington by providing furniture, household goods and life skills workshops. Thanks to A Wider Circle, Taylor now tucks her daughters, Genora, 7, and Anna, 1, into beds of their own each night. Genora has a desk where she does her homework, and the girls have a cabinet full of books for Taylor to read to them. ""Once we get their homes furnished they have a chance to just take a breath and start to create a different life,"" said Bergel, 51. Despair in the shadows . Behind the stately monuments and pristine Capitol Hill, Washington is plagued by hardship and despair. More than 18% of the city's residents live in poverty . Bergel witnessed the need firsthand 13 years ago as a volunteer distributing food to families around the city. ""Most apartments had nothing but a chair. People were storing their clothes in plastic garbage bags. There was nowhere for them to eat their meals. There was nothing that would give these people a sense of hope, a sense of dignity,"" he said. Today, Bergel's group operates two warehouses stocked with furniture, linens, clothing and toys, where families can pick out the items they need. ""We can be a family again, have a home again, come together again,"" Taylor said. ""Now my kids can pursue their dreams, their goals."" From poverty to possibility . For families like Taylor's, A Wider Circle also provides long-term assistance through workshops on topics such as job readiness, financial planning and nutrition. ""Most people are in poverty because they were born into it,"" Bergel said. ""The best way for them to get out of poverty is through support."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes . The group's Well Mother, Well Baby program helps low-income teen mothers learn about newborn care, positive parenting and financial management. They are also paired with mentors. In addition, the program equips new mothers with cribs, changing tables, strollers and other items to help them raise healthy children. ""My goal is to help people find the hope that was missing in their lives, and to see the opportunities that are before them,"" Bergel said. The power of a bed . For Bergel, it's personal. After donating his bed to A Wider Circle six years ago, he has slept most nights on his couch. He vows to sleep without a bed until every person in the United States has one of their own. ""I'm able to tell the hundreds of people who reach out to us for assistance each day -- and have been sleeping on the bare floor for years -- that I know how hard it is and mean it,"" he said. Bergel would like to expand his services nationwide and says he won't feel satisfied until his group has helped all families in need. He works 15-hour days, seven days a week. ""I want to help create the change that will enable people to rise out of poverty and enjoy the freedom and independence afforded to others,"" he said. ""Poverty is a human problem, and human beings will solve it."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN)Greg Ozubko never thought he'd be tending goal at this point in his life. Not just because he's 50, but because 16 years ago he was having so much pain in his hands and feet he couldn't walk across a parking lot, let alone put his feet in a pair of skates or drop to his knees to stop a puck. Like many Canadians, Ozubko started playing hockey as a kid. When he grew up he wanted to be Wayne Gretzky. He played through high school and college, but knew he wasn't good enough to realize  his NHL dreams. So he moved on in life. He started a graphics business, got married and settling down in Atlanta. His hockey gear, it collected dust in the closet. In 1998 he started having unexplained pain. It was so severe that nothing could touch his joints. ""Once the symptoms started they were pretty debilitating,"" he remembers. After a series of doctor's visits and tests, he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Doctors were able to find a medication that worked for him. That was life changing. By 2002, he felt so great that while watching his home NHL team, the Atlanta Thrashers, he made a decision. The team was horrible that year and in watching them struggle motivated him. He would get back on the ice. ""One night it just flipped a switch and it just went, I wanna go do this again,"" he says. The next day Ozubko says he unearthed his old goalie gear from the 1980s. He dusted it off and headed to the rink. He decided he wanted to be a goalie. There was a learning curve though. The modern techniques goalies used were different from when he was a kid. He had to learn. He must have been a quick study, because his style of playing caught the attention of some coaches along the way. They invited him to play in an elite group of hockey players in the Atlanta area. That led to an invitation to training camp for the minor league team called the Gwinnett Gladiators. Ozubko made the cut and was tapped as the East coast hokey league team's backup goalie. Quickly he was blocking shots from players half his age. He's always ready to step in whenever one of the teams' goalies is injured or when the team's goalie would called up to the majors. Today he's retired from minor league play. But he still feels good enough to play.  He fills in on goalie when they need one for team practice. He mentors many of his much younger teammates and works as a player liaison. That time playing with the Gladiators has left its mark. Ozubko remembers taking it all in as he dressed for his first professional game in November 2011. ""It was a profound experience,"" Ozubko says. His mission now is to remind the young guys how lucky they are to have landed a coveted spot on a team. ""When I first started doing this I was 47 and I never would have believed that I would have had an opportunity like this,"" he says. To him, his ability to play, even for a short amount of time, it is a true gift.","Greg Ozubko suffered terrible arthritis pain and couldn't walk .
His NHL team the Atlanta Thrashers were having a terrible season .
That made him determined to get better ."
"Ex-New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the July 2012 killings of two men in Boston, authorities said Thursday. Hernandez, 24, could be arraigned as early as next week. He is currently in jail awaiting trial in a separate case: the 2013 slaying of Odin Lloyd, who was dating a sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said at a news conference Thursday that a grand jury returned the indictments in the shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. ""Mr. de Abreu and Mr. Furtado were ambushed and executed as they drove home along Shawmut Avenue in Boston's South End in the early morning hours of July 16, 2012,"" Conley said. In addition to the two counts of first-degree murder, Hernandez also has been charged with three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, the district attorney added. The latter four counts reflect shots fired at three people, one of whom was wounded, inside the car that de Abreu and Furtado were in, Conley said. Conley said that Hernandez was driving an SUV that pulled up alongside de Abreu and Furtado's car near the nightclub and that the former football star fired a .38-caliber revolver at them. Hernandez has also been charged with unlawfully carrying the gun he allegedly used in the attack, Conley said. The gun has been recovered by authorities. CNN's calls to Hernandez's attorney were not immediately returned. He 'may have been the shooter' Confirmation that Hernandez was suspected in the Boston slayings came when documents were unsealed in court in January. In those records, it is suggested that Hernandez was the trigger man in de Abreu and Furtado's killings. ""There is ... probable cause to believe that Aaron Hernandez was operating the suspect vehicle used in the shooting homicides ... and may have been the shooter,"" reads a June 2013 warrant that was part of the unsealed batch of records. The warrant was used to search a Toyota 4Runner linked to Hernandez that, according to court documents, witnesses saw at the scene of the crime. The warrant gave permission to search for gun residue on the SUV, which was recovered at the home of Hernandez's uncle in Bristol, Connecticut. In search warrant affidavits, investigators have said Hernandez and another man, later identified as Alexander Bradley, followed de Abreu and Furtado into the club. The former star football player and Bradley are seen on security cameras together inside Cure Lounge and driving an SUV that had been following de Abreu and Furtado when they left the club, according to court papers. Witnesses said that the SUV sped away after multiple shots were fired at the car. In February, the de Abreu and Furtado families filed wrongful death lawsuits against Hernandez, with each family seeking $6 million. They said Thursday they were thankful that the justice system was moving forward with criminal charges. ""They have wanted some kind of accountability and they feel as if that is starting to happen,"" attorney William Kennedy told reporters while flanked by the fathers of the two men. July 2012 shooting . At Thursday's news conference, Conley described the night that de Abreu and Furtado were killed. About 12:30 a.m. on July 16, 2012, de Abreu and Furtado arrived at the Cure Lounge in Boston's theater district. By coincidence, Hernandez and another person entered the club at the same time, Conley said, adding that the investigation has not uncovered evidence that the two sets of men knew each other. Instead, he said, it seems that their ""chance encounter"" inside the club ""triggered a series of events that culminated in these murders."" The victims left the club about 2 a.m. and drove away, unaware, the district attorney said, that Hernandez was driving behind them. When the victims' car stopped at a red light, Hernandez's SUV pulled up beside it. ""Aaron Hernandez then fired a .38-caliber revolver multiple times from the driver's side of his vehicle into the passenger's side of the victims' vehicle,"" Conley said. De Abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest, and Furtado, who was in the front passenger seat, was struck multiple times and gravely wounded with a shot to the head, the district attorney said. Two backseat passengers escaped injury and ran from the car. A third man remained in the car and suffered a wound to his arm, Conley said. June 2013 shooting . Law enforcement has focused on Hernandez since he was arrested in June. He was charged with first-degree murder and weapons charges in connection with the shooting death of Lloyd, a 27-year-old semipro football player, in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, about a mile from Hernandez's home. On June 17, a jogger found Lloyd's body riddled with gunshot wounds at an industrial park. Prosecutors have said that on that day, Lloyd was seen was seen around 2:30 a.m. with Hernandez and Hernandez's friends, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, in a rented silver Nissan Altima. On June 18 and 22, police searched Hernandez's home. Days later, the football player was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in Lloyd's death. Hernandez also was hit with five weapons-related charges. In court on June 26, First Assistant District Attorney Bill McCauley said that Hernandez ""drove the victim to the remote spot, and then he orchestrated his execution."" ""He orchestrated the crime from the beginning,"" McCauley said. ""He took steps to conceal and destroy evidence, and he took steps to prevent the police from speaking to ... an important witness."" Hernandez pleaded not guilty, and a judge ordered him held without bail. The NFL's Patriots then dropped the tight end from the team roster. On Thursday, Lloyd's sister, Olivia Thibou, said the new indictment of Hernandez shocked her. ""It's pretty scary to hear that someone was on the street, in the public eye, and is such an icon, and now we learn that this is (allegedly) happening behind the scenes,"" she said. After the July 2012 double homicide, Hernandez continued to play football. During the next season, he had 51 receptions for 483 yards and five touchdowns. The Patriots finished the regular season with 12 wins and four losses and won the AFC East Division. They lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC championship game. At the June 26 hearing, defense attorney Michael Fee said that the evidence against his client was circumstantial and that bail should be granted so that Hernandez could return home to spend time with his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, and his child, then 8 months old. ""It is a circumstantial case. It is not a strong case,"" Fee said, arguing that Hernandez had cooperated with law enforcement and was not a flight risk. While investigators worked, and the former football star stayed in jail, the Lloyd case took several twists and turns. Last month, Hernandez's associates, Ortiz and Wallace, were indicted on murder charges in connection with Lloyd's killing. ""Ernest Wallace did not shoot or kill anybody,"" Wallace's attorney, David Meier of Boston, told CNN on April 11. Wallace pleaded not guilty Thursday to the murder charge in court in Fall River. Among Hernandez's jail visitors have been his fiancée and cousin, Tanya Cummings Singleton, both of whom face charges in connection with the Lloyd homicide, the court papers revealed in February. Prosecutors on Thursday announced that Singleton was charged with criminal contempt of court in connection with the de Abreu and Furtado slayings. The grand jury has also returned an additional indictment charging Singleton with criminal contempt of court, Conley said. Last October, Jenkins pleaded not guilty to perjury charges after prosecutors alleged that she lied to a grand jury and disposed of evidence.","Attorney says fathers of two men killed pleased that case is moving forward .

"Mika Yamamoto's first day in Syria would also be her last. A veteran war reporter, Yamamoto had accepted an assignment to cover the increasing violence in the country last month, as she had in the past in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Balkans. Kazutaka Sato was her partner both in and out of work -- they both worked for Japan Press, an independent television news provider. He was just meters from her when she was shot. Sato had covered many war zones with Yamamoto and describes her passion for journalism. ""I think it was her firm belief that you can stop a war with journalism ... she would also turn her attention to children. I believe she wanted to tell the world how they are hurt, dead and bruised in their hearts."" Japanese journalist killed in Syria . Sato says he is not coping well with her loss and the only way he can find peace is to learn exactly what happened to his common-law wife. He says they were in the besieged city of Aleppo with the rebel Free Syrian Army when he saw 10 to 15 men walking towards them. ""At first I thought it was the Free Syrian Army, and we were on the same side so I held up my camera and started shooting.  It was then that it happened."" Sato describes seeing one man in an olive green helmet, which made him think they were from the Syrian Army, but there was no way to be certain. As he turned and ran, he heard gunshots, followed by an automatic weapon firing. ""I thought I was going to be hit and that's when I was separated from Mika,"" he says. For the next hour he tried to find her, believing she was fine. ""At no point did I think that she had died,"" he says. ""I asked a rebel fighter where Mika was. He told me, 'She's at the hospital, go and see for yourself.' At that point I pretty much imagined what had happened to her... On the first floor of the hospital, in the lobby to the left on a stretcher, I saw a body wrapped in a sheet. And I knew then it was Mika."" Video of slain journalist's final hours . Sato believes Mika was targeted because she was a foreign journalist. He says one of the armed men had shouted, ""There they are, the Japanese,"" but it is difficult to determine exactly what was said from the video that captured her final moments. Sato watches that footage -- filmed by Yamamoto when she was hit by the bullet -- for the first time. ""In the video she's alive,"" he says in a quiet voice. ""I don't know how I'm going to deal with this, I can hear her voice."" He has asked the Syrian government through the embassy in Tokyo to look into her death but says he holds little hope for an answer. ""I need to know what happened to her,"" he says. ""Mika was the best part of my professional and personal life. She was my right hand, my left hand, my everything. I have no idea what to do now she's no longer here.""","Veteran war reporter Mika Yamamoto was killed while working in Syria last month .

"As a country, Turkey is often described as a bridge between Europe and Asia. On Tuesday, for the first time, the two continents will be officially connected by a multi-billion dollar underwater railway tunnel. Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Abdullah Gul, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta and numerous transport and trade ministers gathered to open the giant rail system, on the country's republic day. The Marmaray link, named by combining the Sea of Marmara with ""ray,"" meaning rail in Turkish, is a part of $4.5 billion, 76-kilometer mega-project launched by the government in 2004. Erdogan, speaking at the event, said the project ""connects history and future, past and the future, as well as connecting continents, Marmaray connects people, nations and countries."" Its scale, along with designs for a third airport, a parallel canal for the Bosphorus river and a third suspension bridge, are seen as overly ambitious plans by Erdogan to build his legacy and hark back to days of the Ottoman Empire. The bold project brings the dreams of Sultan Abdul Medjid, first outlined more than a century ago, to reality as the Turkish Republic celebrates its 90th anniversary. READ MORE: Silk Road railways link Europe and Asia . It is finally being completed by Erdogan after he faced  intense protests for the redevelopment plans of a central Istanbul park with Ottoman-era military barracks and a mosque. The 13.6 kilometer (8.5 miles) tunnel -- the deepest of its kind -- passes under the Bosphorus Strait, one of the busiest shipping arteries in the world. The financial capital of Istanbul, with a population of nearly 15 million people, is often snarled with traffic, with some two million residents making the crossing between continents on a daily basis. According to Erdogan, Marmaray ""is not a project only for Istanbul Marmaray is a project for whole humanity."" The rail system, built by a Turkish-Japanese consortium, is expected to have a capacity of one and a half million people a day, connecting the two continents in about four minutes. The Marmaray is being described as a vital link on the modern Silk Road, which will provide seamless rail transport from Turkey to China. Turkey, under Erdogan, has looked east to tap emerging markets for growth. More than half its exports go to the European Union, and that slowdown has cut Turkey's annual growth in half after it peaked above 8% before the 2008-09 financial crisis. READ MORE: The world's spectacular infrastructure projects . Beyond the size of such an undertaking, digging for the Marmaray uncovered some 40 thousand artefacts and helped archaeologists trace Istanbul's history back 8,500 years, 2,500 more than ever believed before. However the discoveries delayed the project for four years, which frustrated the prime minister who, analysts and businessmen say, wants to put a permanent imprint on Turkey's financial capital. The project also had to account for Turkey's long history of violent earthquakes, and the tunnel's position parallel to a major fault line. Transport minister Binali Yildirim has outlined the precautions, including that the tunnel is designed handle a quake of 9.0 magnitude due to construction that allows movement. READ MORE: Connecting continents amid earthquakes . With these infrastructure projects Erdogan is aiming high, striving to increase Turkey's impact as the republic heads towards its 100th anniversary. Erdogan believes Turkey can double its gross domestic product to $2 trillion, and by doing so stake its claim as one of the top ten economies internationally. But obtaining the financing for this activity after such fierce public resistance may stand in the way of this government's master plan. Tuesday, however, was a day in which Erdogan could point to his pride in Marmaray. It is, he said, ""an artwork that will find its place in history as an environmentalist project as well as being a project of precision and excellence.""","Turkey is often described as the link between Europe and Asia -- now a tunnel will connect the two continents .
The Marmaray link is 76-kilometers long and has cost  $4.5 billion .

"Robin Lim, an American woman who has helped thousands of poor Indonesian women have a healthy pregnancy and birth, was named the 2011 CNN Hero of the Year on Sunday night. Through her Bumi Sehat health clinics, ""Mother Robin,"" or ""Ibu Robin"" as she is called by the locals, offers free prenatal care, birthing services and medical aid in Indonesia, where many families cannot afford care. ""Every baby's first breath on Earth could be one of peace and love. Every mother should be healthy and strong. Every birth could be safe and loving. But our world is not there yet,"" Lim said during ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,"" which took place at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and recognized Lim and the other top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. Many women in the developing world do not have access to contraception or maternal care. According to the United Nations Population Fund, three out of five women giving birth in South Asia do so without a skilled birth attendant on hand. In Indonesia, the average family earns the equivalent of $8 a day, according to the International Monetary Fund. But a baby delivery costs about $70 at a hospital, and a Caesarian section can cost as much as $700. Lim believes Indonesia's high maternal and infant mortality rates are caused in part by these costs, which many women cannot meet. ""The situation is bad ... babies are unattended, deliveries have become commercialized, and mothers die from hemorrhage after childbirth because they can't afford proper care,"" Lim told CNN earlier this year. The CNN Hero of the Year was chosen by the public after an 11-week vote on CNN.com. For being named Hero of the Year, Lim will receive $250,000 for her cause. That's in addition to the $50,000 that she and the rest of the top 10 Heroes each received for making the top 10. This is the fifth year that CNN, with the help of entertainers and other celebrities, have honored everyday people changing the world. Among this year's presenters were comedians Jerry Seinfeld and George Lopez; actors J.R. Martinez and Chris Colfer; musical artists Ice Cube and will.i.am; model Christy Turlington Burns; former NFL quarterback Kurt Warner; and actresses Laura Dern, Mary-Louise Parker and Sofia Vergara. (Photos: Scenes from the night) Kid Rock performed the song ""Care"" from his platinum-selling album ""Born Free,"" while Miley Cyrus sang her triple-platinum hit ""The Climb."" Turlington Burns introduced Lim's video tribute during Sunday's show, before the Hero of the Year announcement. As founder of Every Mother Counts, she is also a passionate advocate for maternal health around the world. ""Eight years ago, after giving birth to my first child, Grace, I felt what could have been a life-threatening complication,"" she told the audience of nearly 5,000. ""It suddenly got very scary, very fast. If I hadn't received the expert care in the hospital birthing center I was in, then I may have not been so fortunate. ""My wish is that every mother all over the world has the same chance surviving childbirth I had. My friend Robin Lim shares that wish and she spends her days and nights making it so."" Photos: See how Lim helps thousands of women . Turlington Burns recently made the trip to Indonesia to meet Lim and see her work firsthand. Lim became a midwife after her sister -- and her sister's baby -- died from complications during pregnancy several years ago. She and her husband then sold their home in Hawaii and moved to Bali to ""reinvent their lives,"" she said. ""It was there she learned she could make a difference,"" Turlington Burns said. ""She opened a clinic, Bumi Sehat, so poor mothers can give birth safely and be treated with dignity and respect. She has delivered thousands of babies, and that is why they call her 'Ibu' -- Mother."" After being announced as the CNN Hero of the Year, a tearful Lim accepted the award from host Anderson Cooper and made an impassioned plea for help. ""Today on our Earth, 981 mothers in the prime of their life will die -- and tomorrow again and yesterday,"" she said. ""And I'm asking you to help change that.

"A Palestinian-American minor has been killed by the Israel Defense Forces, the U.S. State Department said. According to a press release from the State Department, the youth was killed Friday during clashes in Silwad, a town in the West Bank. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA identified him as Orwa Hammad, 14. The IDF said an ""attack was prevented"" when the military fired upon a male hurling a Molotov cocktail on a main road with traffic. The Israeli military declined to comment further on the individual's identity and health status. ""We call for a speedy and transparent investigation, and will remain closely engaged with the local authorities, who have the lead on this investigation,"" said Jen Psaki, spokeswoman for the State Department. Tensions have remained high in the region after the bodies of three Israeli teenagers were found in the West Bank in June. Reprisal attacks, rocket fire and retaliatory airstrikes followed. Seven weeks of heavy fighting ensued, with more than 2,000 Palestinians killed and 67 deaths on the Israeli side. On October 19, a kindergarten girl died and another was seriously injured after an Israeli settler ran over them -- deliberately, according to the official Palestinian news agency, WAFA -- near a village north of the West Bank city of Ramallah. Israeli police say they are investigating. Then, on Wednesday, a 3-month-old girl was killed and several people wounded when a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters at a rail stop in Jerusalem. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld called the incident an apparent ""intentioned event"" and terror attack.","Palestinian-American killed during clashes in West Bank, U.S. State Department says .

"The chair, perhaps the most famous chair in political history, stands in the office of a large, nondescript cement building just a stone's throw away from the U.S. Capitol. That's right, the chair Clint Eastwood used as a prop in his rambling and at times incoherent critique of President Barack Obama at the Republican National Convention is now one of the many pieces of political memorabilia in Reince Priebus' spacious office on First Street in Washington. The chairman of the Republican National Committee gets the joke; the chair is the first thing he points out to a reporter before sitting down behind his desk to discuss how his party must dramatically rethink its strategy and message in hopes of recovering from the national drubbing of 2012. The second collector's item he shows off is a yellow foam cheesehead autographed by Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. It reads: ""To Reince, from one QB to another, Best Wishes! Aaron Rodgers."" Rodgers might be on to something. As RNC chairman, Priebus isn't calling the plays: That's up to House Republican leadership and the ambitious GOP governors roaming state capitols around the country. But he is reading the other team and making crucial adjustments to the game plan. Priebus is also the general manager, responsible for helping build the team and manage the expectations of ownership. And he has many owners to answer to: 168 Republicans who make up the national committee, deep-pocketed donors who write the checks, grass-roots activists who provide conservative energy, and the lawmakers who have an immediate personal stake in the party's success. Boehner says Obama's focus is to 'annihilate the Republican Party' A two-tiered goal to restructure, rebrand GOP . That's why Priebus is developing a political plan he hopes, in the near term, will re-energize his party in time for the 2014 midterm elections, while also developing a long-term strategy to compete among key demographic voting blocs -- Hispanic, Asian, African-American -- that broke so heavily Democratic in November. To hear Priebus tell it, the goal is two-tiered: restructure the party on a tactical level to match the sophisticated and data-driven efforts of the Obama campaign, and create a communications plan to sell the GOP's message to voters it failed to connect with in 2012. GOP's surprising edge on diversity . It's an overwhelming task and it's going to cost money, lots of money. ""I've been meeting with donors since the election in November,"" Priebus said. ""I would say I am pleasantly surprised how quickly the donors who have given so much are ready to build a party that is a year-round operation."" Bennett: GOP, play offense in Obama's second term . As he reflected on the presidential race, it quickly became clear that one of the most bothersome aspects of the presidential race was the marathon debate schedule. The primary debates were a point of frustration for some Republicans, who felt the process was controlled by the news media, not the party, in the past election. ""I believe that No. 1, we have to control the debates,"" Priebus said. ""I think that having over 20 debates is too many, and I think we ought to regulate the debates, pick the moderators and get involved in setting the calendar."" Priebus cautioned his comments are not set in stone and he described his ideas in ""hypothetical"" terms. One idea he mentioned was instituting a penalty system in which candidates for the nomination would lose a percentage of delegates if they participated in a debate not sanctioned by the RNC. Dark horse candidates hungry for media attention would likely oppose such a move, but it's unclear if they would have the power to prevent a change in the rules. The idea of handpicking moderators would also face stiff opposition from the media organizations who foot the bill to stage and broadcast the debates. Primary calendar needs to be condensed . As for the primary calendar, Priebus said he would like to see it condensed to allow the eventual GOP nominee more time to prepare for the general election. In an ideal world, he said, the intra-party fight would start later and finish sooner, with the Republican National Convention possibly being held as early as June. But he doesn't talk about changing the order of the four leadoff primary and caucus states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina -- that have traditionally kicked off the nomination process. ""I think that the carve-out states have served us well, but I think the timing of the calendar and the rest of the calendar issue should be looked at,"" he said. Priebus rejected the notion of the RNC becoming involved in presidential primaries to assist the strongest candidate, but he was quick to point out that state Republican parties can choose to play in primaries if they want. ""State parties can decide for themselves,"" he said. ""It's their choice."" In terms of outreach to minorities, Priebus said the GOP failed to pass a very basic test. Attracting minority voters a key GOP goal as Obama begins second term . ""Well, for one thing, we have to ask for the vote,"" he said. ""You have to ask for it and I don't think that we've been doing a very good job of that."" Priebus said a glaring organizational flaw for Republicans is that there have been no long-term investments made in human capital to help sell the GOP message on a neighborhood to neighborhood level. It's more than just having an outreach director in a state -- it's having dedicated, full-time staffers on a grass-roots level to run ""voter registration, hold community events, go to swearing-in ceremonies ... having real job descriptions for lots and lots of people on a yearlong basis in communities that move the dial."" The party's standing among Hispanics emerged as a damaging sore spot last year for national Republicans, who were forced to answer for hard-line immigration positions from prominent conservative figures, including their own presidential nominee. Obama won with 71% of the Hispanic vote, according to CNN national exit polls. Outreach to Hispanics has already begun, Priebus says . ""I think you are seeing a lot of movement from our party on these issues,"" said Priebus, who said outreach has already begun. ""A lot of it, I tell you, was tone. You know, it wasn't necessarily the policy on immigration, it was what is coming out of your mouth."" He specifically mentioned a comment by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who suggested illegal immigrants might ""self-deport"" and leave the country willingly. ""When you talk about stuff of self-deportation, it is probably not the best place to start,"" Priebus said. Still, Priebus said he believes that Republicans, not Democrats, better represent the ideals and goals of all voters, including minorities who turned out in droves to re-elect the president. Priebus plans to explain his vision for the overhaul of his party in more detail to the 168 RNC members who arrive in Charlotte, North Carolina, this week for a three-day meeting that will focus almost entirely on this subject. Five Republican heavyweights -- Henry Barbour, Sally Bradshaw, Ari Fleischer, Zori Fonalledas and Glenn McCall -- are helping Priebus craft the recovery plan, dubbed ""The Growth and Opportunity Project."" Just as Obama asked Democrats to nominate him as their presidential nominee in Charlotte in September, Priebus will ask RNC members on Friday to elect him to another two-year term. It will be more of a formality than an election, because Priebus has only token opposition and has locked down enough support to maintain his role as chairman. ""Both the grass-roots and the donors have to be on the same page, and I think I am in a unique position to do that,"" he said. Priebus predicts a more 'granular' approach for GOP . Priebus is in a unique position because of his financial stewardship of the national committee, which two years ago was saddled with nearly $25 million in debt after the departure of controversial former RNC chairman Michael Steele. ""Our money situation here was so bad that both credit cards were suspended when I walked in the door,"" he said. ""So when we went to go book travel or anything like that, we didn't have a credit card to put the travel on. Fortunately, we had my two credit cards, so we maxed out both of those cards."" Priebus estimated he spent $40,000 to $50,000 on his personal credit cards, which he was eventually reimbursed. Dialing for dollars became Priebus' priority, a tough task for a depressed donor base that saw super PACs and the congressional campaign committees as viable alternatives to the poorly managed RNC. When he started as chairman, Priebus said there were fewer than 100 major RNC donors, people who contributed more than $15,000 per year. By the close of his first year, he said 1,000 people were donating $30,000-plus each year. Paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission showed the RNC ended 2012 with about $3.3 million in the bank and no debt. Unlike two years ago, Priebus won't have to use his own credit card to pay for his plane ticket to Charlotte. Now the big question is whether he will be able to raise enough money to transform the party, and if he can, will his fellow Republicans embrace his plan?","Reince Priebus, who engineered turnaround in GOP's finances, is up for re-election .

"Tatyana McFadden is a force to be reckoned with. Twenty-four years ago, she was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, with an open spinal column, a condition known as spina bifida. Normally, babies with spina bifida are operated on immediately after birth to minimize permanent nerve damage. Tatyana had to wait 21 days. Her legs never worked and being an unwanted, disabled child, she spent the first six years of her life in an orphanage that was so poor it couldn't afford a wheelchair for her. That didn't slow her down -- she walked on her hands. In 1994, a chance visit to the orphanage by a U.S. government official brought Tatyana and Deborah McFadden together. The girl immediately sensed this would be her mother. Once she arrived in the United States, Tatyana received much needed medical care and began to flourish. She went from being the youngest member of the U.S. Summer Paralympic Team to 15-time World Championship medalist (including 11 gold medals), a 10-time Olympic medalist in wheelchair racing, and a gold medal winner in London two years ago. Late last year, McFadden, whose nickname is ""Beast,"" decided to try paralympic cross-country skiing because she wanted to come back to the country she was born in, compete in Sochi and show all of those left behind at the orphanage never to give up and that disabled people ""can also lead a normal life."" Q: Why did you decide take up cross-country skiing? A: I'm really looking forward to going back to Russia and to compete for my country, the United States. It's good to go back and show that athletes with disabilities can still live a normal life and that you just have to give those people opportunity.  And especially being adopted, and happen to be adopted by an American family ... they're the ones who gave me that love and support to inspire my dreams. So I think it's about showing that and just having fun. I'm really excited to compete. I'll be doing the sprint, the 5K and the 10K plus the biathlon. It's going to be extremely tough, cold, of course. But I'm really excited for the transition. The coaches have been very supportive and really understanding and have a lot of patience for me, because I've been spending a lot of time looking at the snow instead of actually skiing, but the transition has been so much fun. My goal is to make the finals and see where that goes, and then after that I'm back to training for Rio (the 2016 Summer Paralympics) ... So, lots of training all the time, but I love it. Sports is definitely my passion. Q: What's the thing you want people to take away most from hearing your story? A: That there are no limits to what you can achieve if you put your mind to it! Perseverance, dedication, courage are all critical ingredients for success in athletics and success in life. Q: What's one thing you'd want to share above all else? A: Don't put limits on your dreams. If you want it bad enough, you must try, and if you miss the first time, you must try again. Don't let others tell you that your dreams are too big -- or you ambitions impractical. We all must learn to listen to that drive that is within us. If we all listen carefully to that drive within, there are no limits to what we can achieve in life. Q: What was your biggest lesson? A: When I was competing in the Paralympics in Beijing (2008), everyone expected that I would get the gold medal in the 100-meter sprint -- the first of my races. I came in sixth -- and I was devastated. I was in tears and thought I had failed in the eyes of all those who supported me, including my family.  My mom gave me her ""signature pep talk"" and sent me back to the track to continue competing ... and I came away with three silver medals and a bronze medal. What I learned was that your family, your friends, your supporters will always love you as long as you do your best and keep on trying. Q: What made you proudest? Or what's been your hardest thing? A: What was both the hardest ... and the proudest thing that I have done was making the decision to file suit against in Howard County, Maryland, for the right to race alongside able-bodied runners on my high school track team. We achieved victory in Howard County -- creating a new law that has been embraced nationwide -- forever changing the face of high school athletics. Q: What's something you'd change if you could? A: Most people think that I would ""take away my disability"" if I could. But that isn't true. I have lived a wonderful life -- and I do not, in any way at any time, consider myself disabled. We are all born with many gifts ... and the list of gifts that I have been given is endless. If I could change anything, I would make this a world where all children have loving parents (birth parents or adoptive parents) and are able to grow up surrounded by the love and care that can only come from a family. Q: What's the thing you rarely have time to share when you're telling your story but that you feel is important? A: I rarely have a chance to talk about how grateful I am to my family and friends for their unending support -- and to my coaches, particularly Adam Bleakney at the University of Illinois, who thought it would be good idea to ""try a marathon."" I am fueled by the support of those closest to me -- and I can never thank them enough for all they have done to make my life's journey possible.","Tatyana McFadden spent her first six years in a Russian orphanage .

"Few feats of engineering are synonymous with an entire industry. But Boeing's 747 jumbo jet revolutionized air travel, adding to the glamour, romance and, most significantly, affordability of commercial flight, while simultaneously slapping it in the face by ushering in the bovine era of mass tourism. Monumental in size, the shape of the 747 is iconic itself -- the enormous wings, four engines and that front end ""hump"" make it one of the world's most recognizable aircraft. To this day, the ""upstairs"" seating area -- reserved for a lucky few each flight -- imparts a sense of prestige and exclusivity. Boeing has delivered more than 1,400 of the aircraft to airlines around the world -- not bad for a plane now into its fifth decade. Since its historic debut at the Paris Air Show in 1969, the company has introduced a number of variations to the 747 family, including the 747-100, 747-200 and 747-300. The most common variety for international travelers today are versions of the 747-400. Each new version has brought enhancements. The 747-400's most noticeable change was the addition of winglets, which Boeing describes as ""wing tip extensions which reduce lift-induced drag and provide some extra lift."" The 747-400 is no longer being built -- production ended in 2009. Its successor, the 747-8 Intercontinental, rolled out last year and is currently being built at a rate of two per month. Each 747-8 is made up of about 6 million parts and has a list price of $351.4 million. Lufthansa is the only airline flying the passenger version of the 747-8. It has six in the skies serving cities such as Frankfurt, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Bangalore and New Delhi. The first was delivered in 2012, one of 19 of the aircraft the European carrier ordered, with deliveries expected to be completed in 2015. This month, the airline added the 747-8 to its Hong Kong-Frankfurt route and invited CNN to tour the latest version of the classic jumbo jet. So what's different? No surprise that the 747-8 Intercontinental looks like a 747. Though 70% of the airplane's structural weight is brand new, it has the same iconic shape, though with some noticeable external differences. The wings are new -- an upgrade Boeing hadn't originally intended for the new design. Gone are the winglets, replaced by raked wingtips Boeing says increase aerodynamics and, thus, fuel efficiency. The same design is being used on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. Boeing says the 747-8 is approximately 14% more fuel efficient per seat than its predecessor. The engines are new, too. There are still four, but the new design features a scallop-edged casing around each newly developed General Electric engine. As important, though less noticeable to the typical passenger, the plane has been stretched. It's 5.6 meters (18 feet) longer than its predecessor, with a total length of 76.3 meters (250 feet). Boeing points out this makes the 747-8 about a meter longer than the Airbus A340-600 and thereby the longest commercial aircraft in the world. The upper deck is also stretched. ""We chose this location (for additional room) because it is here that the airlines benefit the most -- both from the premium seating on both the upper and lower decks, as well as in the cargo hold,"" says Boeing's Joanna Pickup. Inside, the plane still has that exhilarating new airplane smell (kind of like new car smell, but a lot more expensive), with windows and surfaces joyously free of the scratches, smudges and hair goo residue all too typical of the commercial flying experience. When we toured it was also free of other passengers -- no screaming kids nor (sadly) smiling cabin crew manning the drinks cart. While we can't comment on the flying experience, the Lufthansa 747-8 interior is sleek, comfortable, modern and efficient. In other words, German -- designed to get you from A to B in good shape without over the top frills. In economy class, where seats are naturally skeletal compared with their fat cousins up front, nothing feels tacky or about to break. Or worse still, like your father-in-law has been sitting in it for 20 years. 'Wow factor' With the plane comes Lufthansa's new business class, which will be retrofitted on the rest of the airline's fleet. We've reeled off some of business class' features and other enhancements in the gallery above. Expect the mod cons -- fully flat seats in biz and first, video on demand, power plugs and iDevice ports and new features such as sound-insulating curtains and cool automatic window shades in first class. On the whole, the plane feels spacious. Admittedly, this is easier to pull off when no one else is aboard, but relocating some storage area to sidewalls (not in overhead spaces) adds a lot of cabin room and makes it less likely passengers will bash their heads on compartments above in that frantic post-landing-must-touch-my-carryon-immediately moment of choreographed (and mystifying) panic. Lufthansa can carry 386 passengers on its 747-8 in its 8-80-298 (first-business-economy) arrangement. The upper deck is home to 32 business class seats in a 2-2 configuration -- the width of the area is roughly the same as the interior of the 737-700. It's here and at the front of the plane that Lufthansa is aiming to attract customers in the competitive but lucrative East Asia-Europe route. ""This gives us a competitive shift. We have been here for 52 years and we know that customer expectations are high. That's why we are the first to bring the 747-8 to Hong Kong,"" says Andrew Bunn, Lufthansa general manager for Hong Kong, South China, Taiwan and Macau. ""It brings a unique element to our brand. From an economic point of view, it gives us more capacity and is more cost effective. For customers, they will notice and appreciate the enhancements on board. ""More than anything, it is exciting. It is a new experience. It is a new aircraft. There is certainly a 'wow' factor, not just for our customers. People all over the airport are taking pictures of the aircraft every day."" Still capturing attention, this legend of the skies is showing no signs of retirement. Rather, the 747-8 is the latest chapter in a legendary chunk of aviation history.","747-8 Intercontinental is latest version of the iconic 747 jumbo jet .

"(CNN)The aftermath of 'Twirlgate' rumbled on at the Australian Open on Friday, with Canadian star Eugenie Bouchard saying she was fine with being asked to twirl -- if men were asked to ""flex their muscles and stuff."" Following her second-round victory over Kiki Bertens on Wednesday, a male interviewer had asked the 20-year-old Bouchard for a twirl. Cue uproar on social media. As it turns out, Bouchard's request for greater equality had already been granted before she pirouetted on court. In a video posted on the Australian Open's website dated January 19, 14-time grand slam winner Rafael Nadal -- known partly for his muscular physique -- was asked to bare his chest. The question came not from a man or woman, but from what looked like a tablet device as part of a series where tennis players are quizzed on various subjects as they are driven around Melbourne in a car manufactured by one of the event's sponsors. The exact question to Nadal was this: ""Females love when you take your top off. Can you do it now?"" ""I have to do it now?"" replied Nadal, who was sitting beside his public relations manager. He then took off his sweatshirt and began to take off his t-shirt before leaving it on. ""I am joking,"" he said with a smile as the t-shirt stayed on. Nadal's interview hasn't attracted much attention, but Billie Jean King, the 12-time grand slam winner and longtime advocate for equality, took note of the question to Bouchard -- and was less than amused. And in a tweet posted Thursday, King wrote: ""The Australian Open interviewer asking the women to 'twirl' on court is out of line. ""This is truly sexist. If you ask the women, you have to ask the guys to twirl as well. Let's focus on competition and accomplishments of both genders and not our looks."" Amid the controversy Bouchard retained her trademark cool after ousting Caroline Garcia Friday. ""Personally, I'm not offended,"" Bouchard said. ""No, I think it was an in-the-moment thing and it was funny. But, yeah, I mean, it's just funny how it's taken a life of its own. ""I'm just going to try to focus on my tennis.""","Eugenie Bouchard not ""offended"" by being asked to twirl .

"The NFL has denied Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson's appeal of a season-long suspension, league spokesman Greg Aiello tweeted Friday night. The decision was made by appeals officer Harold Henderson. Henderson said, ""I conclude that the player has not demonstrated that the process and procedures surrounding his discipline were not fair and consistent,"" according to Aiello's tweet. In November, Peterson was suspended without pay for the rest of the 2014 season because he violated the league's personal conduct policy ""in an incident of abusive discipline that he inflicted on his 4-year-old son last May,"" the league said. The National Football League Players Association said: ""The NFLPA expected this outcome, given the hearing officer's relationship and financial ties to the NFL. The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement. ""This decision also represents the NFL's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. Our union is considering immediate legal remedies.""

He has said publicly that his misconduct was not enough to force him out of office, and has insisted he will be vindicated by ""a full presentation of the facts.""

Did mayor target victims of military sexual assault? The talks come on the heels of Filner's intensive two-week behavioral therapy, which was apparently aimed at ending his allegedly backward ways of treating women in the workplace.

"(CNN)Yasser Arafat is gone. Yet 10 years after his death, he's survived by the internal frustration and outward animosity that's long defined relations among and between Israelis and Palestinians. So, too, has the violence that's marred the region for decades. Recent incidents have stirred fears in Israel of a return to 2002, then in the midst of a second intifada, or armed uprising, when the Israeli government reported 452 people died in suicide bombings and other attacks. Fatah cancels Arafat memorials after bombings, blames Hamas . On one day alone last week, an Israeli soldier was stabbed to death on a Tel Aviv street while three Israelis were stabbed -- one fatally -- at the same West Bank hitchhiking post where three Israeli teens were kidnapped earlier this year. This came after several incidents in which drivers ran into crowds on busy streets, and before Tuesday, when two knife- and axe-wielding Palestinian cousins killed four Israelis worshipping at a Jerusalem synagogue. So does this all mean a third intifada is coming, if it's not already here? No -- or, at least, not yet, according to experts. Much has changed, they point out, since Arafat's death. It's harder than ever to get from the West Bank into Israel, especially with explosives and such. There has been no call to arms by the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank; instead, analysts say, there has been significant cooperation with Israeli authorities to ferret out potential attackers. And there haven't been anything close yet to the coordinated, large-scale attacks in Israel like those of the early 2000s. As retired former Israeli National Security Adviser Maj. Gen. Yaakov Amidror pointed out last week, what's happening now ""falls far from"" the first two intifadas, as far as the overall threat to Israel. But one thing that hasn't changed is the deep frustration among Palestinians. Now, as was the case over a decade ago, many still harbor steep distrust at Israeli authorities and diminishing hopes for a political breakthrough. ""The nature of these movements is that spark could ignite the tinder,"" said Jon B. Alterman, the head of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Middle East program. ""... And once it starts moving, you have no idea where it's going to go."" Israeli troop kill Palestinian man in West Bank clashes . Voids in Palestinian hope, leadership . Arafat is still considered a hero among many Palestinians, as the scenes around the West Bank commemorating his death last Tuesday showed. This was a man, according to his supporters, who stood up to Israel. This was a man who rallied Palestinians to fight. This was a man who got leaders around the world to buy into the idea of an independent Palestinian state. Not only is there no more Arafat, but the idea of a unified Palestinian front is a thing of the past as well. Arafat's former group, Fatah, now controls the West Bank under Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, while rival Hamas is in charge of Gaza. ""You have an unprecedented division,"" said the Brookings Institution's Khaled Elgindy, contrasting that to what he views as Israeli leadership that's become more conservative and less willing to compromise. ""It's a much weaker leadership than we've ever seen."" The lack of a unifying figure, like Arafat, has led to a ""complete alienation of the people from leadership,"" said Ingrid Jaradat Gassner of the Civic Coalition for Palestinian Rights in Jerusalem. Not only don't they have a person to rally around, there's no clear sense of a workable exit strategy that will end the cycle that makes life difficult for many Palestinians. ""People really have no expectation, no hope, no perspective in terms of their being any chance that comes through a political initiative,"" Gassner told CNN from her home in Bethlehem. ""So what we have is an outburst of frustration."" What there is not, however, is any clear organization in the recent efforts to lash out against Israelis -- which was unlike, many say, happened during the second intifada. In some ways, that may be more frightening -- because instead of dealing with a known threat or plot you can unravel, only the attacker may know what will happen next. ""This is a huge problem because there is no intelligence,"" Amidror told reporters on a call coordinated by the Israel Project. ""Someone is getting up in the morning or going out of the mosque at noon and saying, 'Today, I'll kill some Israelis.' ""There is no organization behind it,"" the former Israeli national security adviser said, noting that all someone has to do is take a knife from their kitchen and attack. ""... I don't see any measures that can be taken to stop an individual (like that)."" 2 killed, 2 wounded in stabbing attacks on Israelis . Israeli policies have an impact . What's happening and what's not happening, if you're talking about major attacks, is a testament to Israel's policies as well. A lot has changed since what Israelis called the ""Passover massacre,"" when a man walked into a seaside hotel in spring 2002 and blew himself up, killing 30 civilians. For one, a wall -- or a fence, depending on where you are along the border -- has been erected between the West Bank and Israel, making it harder for anyone intent on attacking to cross over with explosives or weapons. Also, Israel has a renowned intelligence apparatus that's had years of practice in rooting out potential attackers. This is on top of other policies, like stringent measures restricting citizens' ownership of firearms. And even as they push for independence, Israeli authorities also have found a working security partner in the Palestinian Authority. Behind the scenes, the two sides have coordinated efforts to preemptively go after those who might carry out attacks, not to mention common foes from Hamas. ""The two have worked together, and it has prevented many terror attacks inside Israel,"" said the Israel Project's David Harris, predicting both sides will continue to coordinate even if they are publicly at odds. ""And it has also brought much more calm."" Yet as clashes in the West Bank last Tuesday showed, it sometimes doesn't take much for things to turn violent and get out of hand. And Palestinians don't live only there and in Gaza. Many live in Israel, including some 300,000 in East Jerusalem, where there has been recent unrest centered around what Jews know as the Temple Mount and Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. ""The fear for Israel is that the new terrorists (will be) on this side of the fence,"" said Harris. Violence, bad feelings never went away . Even then, discontent among so-called Arab Israelis is not a new thing either. In fact, experts say -- from a security situation -- Israel appears safer from prospective terrorist attacks than it was 10 to 15 years ago. The measures it's instituted in that time have made it harder for armed attackers to get across its borders and inflict mass violence. But according to Gassner, Palestinians' frustrations ""have become worse and worse over time for a lot of reasons."" She says that many feel that Israelis -- whether through increased settlement activity or clamping down on borders and what she calls collective punishment following attacks -- are putting up obstacle after obstacle in their quest for ""normal lives."" ""People want to take care of their families, get their kids to school, have enough income to live off of,"" she said. ""And then the pressure just builds up. That's why we have these repeated eruptions of anger and frustration."" Elgindy, from Brookings, said more forceful responses by Israel to attacks can backfire, reasoning, ""When you respond to violence with more repression, you're going to get more violence."" The ""primitive assault tactics"" now being used against Israelis -- knives and cars, rather than rockets and bombs -- could help further the Palestinians' storyline, especially if Israeli security forces respond ""with a heavy hand"" as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after Tuesday's synagogue attack, expert Assaf Moghadam said. ""(Such tactics) help portray the perpetrators ... as people of desperation; they can claim 'we don't have better means of disposal,'"" said Moghadam, from the Israeli-based International Institute for Counter-Terrorism. ""It's an asymmetric battle militarily of a weaker party against a stronger party."" It's the lack of an end game -- a result that will bring peace, security and happiness to both Israelis and Palestinians -- that has some especially worried. If there's no political end in sight, what's to prevent those frustrations from continuing to build? ""It's probably not going to get a lot worse, and it's almost certainly not going to get a lot better,"" said David Pollock, the director of the Washington Institute's Fikra Forum. ""The best you can say, on both sides, is, 'Well, at least we're not like Syria and Iraq."" CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.","Assailants driving into crowds, stabbings have unnerved some in Israel .

"(CNN) -- Monsters of the deep will have a man-made horror to contend with, as the Crabster CR200 is released into the oceans. Weighing over half a ton, the six-legged, crustacean-inspired robot is intended for the most dangerous undersea exploration. Developed by the Korean Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST), the Crabster offers a solution to a longstanding problem. While propeller-driven craft do not work well in fierce tides, and divers are limited to calm, relatively shallow seas, the new machine mimics the design of crabs and lobsters that live in stormy waters but are still able to control their movements. The Crabster is 2.4m long, 2.4m wide and 1.3m tall -- rising to 1.8m when it stands up. Including payload it weighs around 650 kg, and its six legs contain 30 motors, giving the remote pilot ample control and dexterity. As the Crabster creeps along the ocean floor, it can adapt its posture to different current or pressure conditions, to a depth of around 200 meters. Using sonar, it scans the landscape for objects of interest, and can relay images through onboard cameras. Crabster is undergoing final tests in ""aggressive waters"" ahead of its first mission. In May, it will be hunting for ancient artifacts in the Yellow Sea, where existing crafts have failed. Read this: The guns that know who's firing them . Lead researcher Bong Huan Jun told CNN the machine had performed ""very well"" in tests, but was undergoing constant modification. ""We are performing tests nearly every day,"" Huan Jun told CNN. ""We upgrade Crabster software for more stable and fast walking and manipulation."" The researcher says the robot's speed of just 10 cm/second is one of the main challenges his team face, along with enhancing the vehicle's stability in strong currents and on rough terrain. The underwater vision system is another priority. But should Crabster succeed in its maiden voyage, Huan Jun predicts a widespread impact. ""We suppose CR200 can conduct seabed mapping, survey and inspection of wrecks, pipelines, ecosystems and pollution down to a 200-meter depth. CR200 will help divers or work instead of them in harsh environments. It also could assist in locating underwater resources, carrying out underwater mining, and responding to oil spill incidents."" Huan Jun hopes his creation will be manufactured for use across the world, and is already looking ahead to future incarnations inspired by nature. ""We are now studying to make the Crabster to swim like turtles or diving beetles. And we are also considering the hydraulic Crabster for heavy-duty underwater working."" And are the researchers expecting their machine to be accepted in the marine environment? ""I don't know if the animals treat the Crabster as a real crab or not,"" says Huan Jun. ""I thought fish like it more than the other underwater vehicles with propellers that make noise. I hope animals treat Crabster friendly."" As of its introduction this year, any swimmers that come into contact with the robot may hope for the same treatment. Gallery: What the Internet really looks like .

"(CNN)It may be the most historic plane in the world: Special Air Mission 26000, SAM for short. Not familiar? Maybe you know its nickname. Back in its heyday the sleek, blue and white airliner was called Air Force One. This ain't just ANY Air Force One. SAM 26000 saw more historic events than any other -- ranging from the tragic to the hilarious. A national treasure, the airliner now sits in the Air Force museum in Dayton, Ohio. But you can't see it. It's off limits to visitors. For many history buffs and aviation geeks, that's a cryin' shame. If things were different, visitors could walk down the same cabin aisles where Jacqueline Kennedy mournfully sat beside her husband's casket en route from Dallas to Washington. You could stand in the exact spot where the only woman to preside over a presidential oath swore in Lyndon Johnson as commander-in-chief. Examine with your own eyes the on-board suites that carried President Richard Nixon to Beijing, where he cracked open U.S. relations with China. For more than 30 years, the 100-ton plane transported some of the most powerful figures on the planet -- and once it even carried a history-making ex-White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. Yep, SAM 26000 has seen a few eyebrow-raising situations over the years. Oh my, if only this plane could talk. ""A person could justify that it's the most important historical airplane in the world,"" Air Force historian Jeff Underwood said on the phone, just a stone's throw away from the jet. ""It's a place in history that moves. Every time I get on board, that's what I think about."" So what's the problem? Why is this $36 million plane -- paid for by taxpayers --  shut away in a darkened hangar? It's ironic if you think about it. The plane perhaps most associated with politics has fallen victim to political gamesmanship. About 500 miles away, inside the bubble of Washington's Beltway, political fighting triggered mandatory budget cuts called sequestration. The Air Force ordered the museum to economize -- including temporarily closing the Presidential Gallery where SAM 26000 is parked. Buses that are required to transport visitors to SAM 26000's special hangar are just too pricey. So they shut it down. ""People are very disappointed,"" says Sarah Swan of the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. Staffers are trying to determine whether to hold events marking the 50th anniversary of JFK's death this November. It's bad timing, she admits. Last year, SAM 26000 ranked among the museum's most popular exhibits, drawing almost 90,000 visitors among the facility's total attendance of 1.2 million. Since the hangar doors closed in May, the jet's visitors of course have plunged to zero. History has happened on this plane. And by stepping aboard SAM 26000, visitors say they can imagine it all. They can imagine a newly sworn-in president Johnson grabbing ahold of JFK's casket as he helped White House staff pull it through the plane's rear exit into the cabin. They can paint a mental picture of federal Judge Sarah Hughes swearing in Johnson while a photographer snapped that famous image of LBJ and a grief-stricken and stunned Jacqueline Kennedy. ""You can stand on that spot where President Kennedy's casket came in -- you think about the horror of what was going on and the shock of what happened,"" said Underwood. ""You can look forward toward the nose of the aircraft and know that's where the transfer of power took place, and you can see where Mrs. Kennedy sat near the body of her slain husband. Sometimes I still get goosebumps."" You can imagine the pilot -- Col. James B. Swindal -- as he took off from Dallas to D.C., jetting to an unusually high 41,000 feet to guard against a possible second attack. ""He didn't have any idea whether this was part of a large conspiracy,"" his son, James L. Swindal told, The New York Times. ""He wasn't going to take any chances with a new president in the plane.'' Imagine the dramatic scene a few hours later outside Washington at Andrews Air Force Base as JFK's brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, ""leaped up"" a portable stairway to board the plane. Rushing to console the first lady, RFK ""pushed his way down"" the aisle past President Johnson ""without saying a word,"" wrote historian Steven Gillon. An angry Johnson ""fumed that Kennedy would board the plane without even acknowledging him,"" Gillon claims in ""The Kennedy Assassination, 24 Hours After."" A few days after that, imagine the plane soaring high over Kennedy's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery, as described by historian William Manchester. Saluting the fallen commander in chief, SAM 26000 tipped its wings before Swindal  ""threw all his fuel controls on full and leaned into the wind"" at a blistering 600 mph. Awkward . Many associate the jet with JFK, but the plane was tied just as closely to his two successors, LBJ and Nixon. In 1972, SAM 26000 touched down in the world's most populous nation, as Nixon forged the first U.S. ties with the People's Republic of China. Aboard the plane, a ""burly"" Nixon aide ""blocked the aisle"" to keep staffers from following the president down the stairway to the tarmac, national security adviser Henry Kissinger recalled. Nixon didn't want anyone getting in the way of his historic photo op with China's premier. Nine years later, imagine Nixon sitting with ex-presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter in the ""relatively cramped tail section"" of SAM 26000, as TIME magazine described it. They felt ""somewhat ill at ease,"" as they flew to the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, wrote Carter years later. And they certainly had their reasons -- especially Carter and Ford. Just five years earlier Carter, a Democrat, had delivered a stinging election defeat to the GOP's Ford. Tension also ran high among staffers aboard the flight. They endured long waits to use the lavatories and got upset about who received bigger cuts of steak at dinner, according to author Ronald Kessler. Then Nixon ""surprisingly eased the tension"" with ""courtesy, eloquence and charm,"" Carter revealed in a memoir. Aboard SAM 26000, the two former enemies developed a camaraderie and then a friendship, wrote historian Douglas Brinkley. 'Buck naked' Air Force One was designed for presidential multitasking, generations before the word was even invented. Maybe the funniest example of this concept occurred aboard SAM 26000 at a campaign stop in 1964. Johnson invited reporter Frank Cormier and two colleagues to an impromptu press conference in the plane's bedroom, according to Cormier's book, ""The Way He Was."" The president -- who wanted to change clothes after giving a speech in the hot sun -- astonished the reporters when he ""removed his shirt and trousers,"" while answering their questions about the economy. Johnson then ""shucked off his underwear"" and kept talking while ""standing buck naked and waving his towel for emphasis."" Another time on the jet, Cormier wrote, Johnson was sitting and talking with his legs crossed when an ""airman who served as LBJ's valet"" kneeled before the president and ""quickly removed one of Johnson's shoes and socks, bathed the naked foot then put on a fresh sock and replaced the shoe."" Neither the valet nor the president ever acknowledged each other, and Johnson didn't miss a beat of his conversation. The plane carried LBJ's body after his death in 1973, just as it had Kennedy. Twenty-one years later, it ferried Nixon's casket back home to California. SAM 26000's legacy also includes a footnote labeled, ""Monica Lewinsky."" The former White House intern who later became a central figure in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton flew aboard the plane as a Pentagon staffer on a tour of European nations in the '90s. By that time, the aging SAM 26000 had been demoted as a second-tier presidential aircraft and was reserved as a backup. The Air Force introduced a military version of the Boeing 747 -- much bigger than SAM 26000 -- into the SAM fleet beginning in 1990. SAM 26000 carried about 48 passengers and crew, while the new bigger jets held more than twice as many: 102 passengers and crew with about 4,000 square feet of floor space to roam around in. ""It was such a quantum leap forward in Air Force One's capabilities,"" said Underwood. ""With the added ability of inflight refueling, it freed up Air Force One to do whatever it needed to do."" By 1998, SAM 26000 was done. Then-Vice President Al Gore honored the plane's legacy by hosting its final official flight -- a hop from Washington to Columbia, South Carolina, before it traveled to the Air Force museum in Ohio a few months later. ""If history itself had wings, it probably would be this very aircraft,"" Gore said at the time. As this year's 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination approaches, SAM 26000's caretakers at the Air Force museum have no idea how to plan for it. As Underwood put it, ""We're just held in limbo right now."" It's a mystery whether Congress will end sequestration in October -- or if even deeper cuts will follow. The Air Force is already preparing for a worst-case scenario. At the Pentagon, Air Force brass have no plans to change the current funding situation at the museum -- at least through October, said Air Force Lt. Col. Laurel Tingley. After that, she said, ""we don't know what the new normal will look like in our current fiscal-constrained environment."" In the meantime, the Air Force ""will continue to take action to reduce spending"" as a way to support ""overseas contingency operations and preserve readiness,"" Tingley said. ""It's heartbreaking,"" says Rep. Michael Turner, a Republican member of the powerful House Armed Services Committee who represents the museum's district. ""These are incredibly historic aircraft,"" Turner said, which are inaccessible to visitors because of sequestration that he described as ""shameful and outrageous."" Turner called on the Senate and President Barack Obama to come to the table with a solution and break the deadlock. Despite the closure of the museum's Presidential and Research and Development Galleries, the facility remains open seven days a week, and admission is free. But until funds appear -- or lawmakers in Washington can come together -- the world's most historic plane will stay behind closed doors.

"(Sunset) -- The West's top national monuments: Build a great vacation around a spectacular island, forest, cliff dwelling, canyon, fossil bed, tower or volcano. 1) Bandelier National Monument, New Mexico . Bandelier has been entrancing people for nearly 1,000 years -- from when the Ancestral Pueblo people first began building homes in the cliffs of Frijoles Canyon. They're easily seen on the monument's Main Loop Trail; more ruins can be glimpsed in Tsankawi Canyon to the north. Travel Snapshots: Share your national park photos . But archeology isn't the only reason to come here -- the monument is stunningly beautiful, with dramatic mesas and broad views across Northern New Mexico. All this only a 45-minute drive from Santa Fe. 2) Admiralty Island National Monument, Alaska . Everything you want from Alaska is here. Deep green old-growth forests (thanks to 100 inches of rain a year), rushing streams alive with salmon, a rugged coastline, and the largest collection of brown bears -- AKA grizzlies -- anywhere in the world. In fact, one of the best places to see brown bears anywhere (from a safe distance) is at Pack Creek, on the island's northern shore. Admiralty Island is wild but it isn't remote, just about 15 miles west of Juneau and reachable by boat and floatplane. Tongass National Forest even has cabins you can rent; there are also wilderness lodges. Top 10 national park beaches . 3) Canyon de Chelly National Monument, Arizona . Canyon de Chelly in northern Arizona is one of the longest continuously inhabited places in North America. But it's no mere living history museum -- t's still a vital part of life on the Navajo Nation. You can see White House Ruin from the canyon rim, or take a 2-hour hike to see the ruin up close. And a number of Navajo outfitters lead Jeep, hiking and horseback trips into the canyon backcountry. Nearest hotels are in Chinle. 4) Craters of the Moon National Monument, Idaho . Who needs NASA when you can come to theCraters of the Moon monument about 90 miles north of Twin Falls, Idaho? This eerie lunar landscape is the product of volcanic lava flows that stopped only about 2,000 years ago. (Geologists say they could start up again, although no one seems too worried.) You can see it all on a 7-mile loop drive or if you want to feel boot on lava, hike the North Crater Flow trail. 5) Devil's Tower National Monument, Wyoming . Sure, moviegoers know Wyoming's Devil's Tower as the place where mankind met friendly aliens in Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" But nothing prepares you for the real thing: the 1,300-foot chunk of granite rising out of Wyoming badlands is bigger than even the widest of wide-screen attractions. It's a sacred site to Crow and Cheyenne peoples; once you see it (say on the Tower Trail, which circles the rock's base) you will understand why. 33 perfect summer trips . 6) Grand Staircase National Monument, Utah . The ""staircase"" in the name is a vast series of rock terraces. The ""Escalante"" is Father Silvestre Velez de Escalante, the 18th century Spanish explorer who started the habit of being awed and amazed by the landscape here: cliffs and hoodoos and the sinuous canyons of the Paria and Escalante rivers. In Southern Utah due east of Zion National Park, Grand Staircase National Monument is so big -- 1.9 million acres -- that it would take a lifetime to discover it all. Explore it by car on Utah Highway 12 and Hole-in-the-Rock Road; even better, get out and hike to Calf Creek Falls or Devil's Garden. Numerous outfitters lead jeep and hiking trips into the area; for creature comforts, you'll find good food and places to stay in Boulder and Escalante. 7) John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, Oregon . Elephants! Tigers! Rhinos! All here in Eastern Oregon. Well, not the living animals -- their ancestors, preserved in rock for eternity at the John Day National Monument northwest of Bend. John Day's beautiful badlands contain some 50 million years worth of plants and animals; you can get all that ancient natural history straight at the excellent Thomas Condon Paleontology Center. And the monument offers more than just looking at bones; it's also great for hiking, particularly in the Painted Hills area, which explodes with wildflowers in spring and summer. 8) Mount St. Helens National Monument, Washington . Kaboom! In 1980, nearly 4 billion cubic yards of mountaintop blasted skyward in an instant. Nearly 230 square miles of forest blown down or buried beneath volcanic ash and mud. Even now, decades after an eruption that impacted nearly all of the Pacific Northwest, Mount St. Helens is ranked as the most famously unstable mountain in North America. The geology here is fascinating, of course, but so is the quieter spectacle of forests and meadows gradually reclaiming the mountain's scorched slopes. Must-sees include Johnston Ridge Observatory and Blowdown Forest and Spirit Lake Viewpoints. 10 great one-night escapes . 9) Muir Woods National Monument, California . It seems that something so beautiful shouldn't be this easy to reach. John Muir's favorite woods lie just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, but step onto its trails -- especially on a quiet weekday -- and you are in another world. The coast redwoods (sequoia sempervirens if you want to get Latin about it) grow 300 feet tall; beneath them spread lush carpets of ferns and mosses. With most trails paved and relatively flat, this is a great place to take kids. 10) Pinnacles National Monument, California . Only 90 minutes south of Silicon Valley, Pinnacles proves that California geology is just as creative as Facebook, Google and Apple. The larger-than-life rock formations here were shaped both by ancient volcanoes and by the San Andreas Fault, which runs through the monument. Along with wild rocks, Pinnacles has bragging rights to some of the state's best spring wildflower displays.

"Three Americans are fighting alongside Kurdish forces against the Islamic State terror group in northern Syria, a spokesman for the Kurdish group told CNN on Thursday. One of the Americans was identified by the Kurdish People's Protection Units, also known as the YPG, as Jordan Matson of Wisconsin. Matson is fighting in Haska province near the town of Jazaa, close to the Iraqi border, YPG spokesman Redur Xelil said by telephone. Intense fighting between ISIS and YPG has been reported in the region in recent weeks. Xelil declined to provide further details about Matson and the other two Americans, and he did not say if they were fighting in the same area. A photo has been posted by a Kurdish news agency purporting to show Matson, and the picture of the man appears to resemble Facebook photos of a man identifying himself as Matson. Twitter posts, purporting to have taken messages from Matson's Facebook page, say he left for Syria in September and that he suffered a minor wound while fighting ISIS. The Facebook page says he attended Case High School in Racine. CNN cannot confirm the validity of the posts, but the report of his injury was confirmed by Xelil, who said Matson was injured a few days ago and was fine. A person claiming to be a friend of Matson's told Reuters that Matson told people he was being hired by a private army to fight ISIS. ""He sent me a personal Facebook message on the 16th of September saying 'Hey boss, I'm heading to Syria,'"" Miguel Caron told the news agency. Matson was previously in the U.S. military, Caron said. Caron did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. The U.S. military confirmed a man by the name of Jordan Matson enlisted in the Army in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, and served from May 2006 to November 2007. ""We're certainly aware of these reports,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters during a briefing on Thursday. ""Because of privacy concerns we can't speak to it further."" Psaki said she was not aware of a specific law barring Americans from going abroad to join military organizations that have not been designated a foreign-terror organization.","Official: Jordan Matson is one of three Americans fighting with Kurdish force in Syria .

"After 17 minutes and 14 seconds of Sunday's ""El Clasico"" encounter with Real Madrid, Barcelona fans will offer a vocal demonstration of why the club's motto is ""mes que un club"" -- more than a club. The team's Nou Camp stadium will erupt with the sound of the Catalan national anthem, sung in the language native to this semi-autonomous region of Spain. It is to commemorate September 11, 1714, and the people who died when the ruling monarchy defeated Catalan troops during the War of the Spanish Succession. It is arguably the biggest club game in the world -- though all too often surrounded by a bucketload of bile between players, coaches and fans -- but as austerity tightens its grip on the Spanish economy, the desire for Catalan independence grows ever deeper. The fixture against Real, a club so long synonymous with Spain's rulers and its royalty, provides a poignant opportunity for the Catalonian cause to be expressed directly to the Madrid powers. ""For every Euro Catalonia gives to Spain, it only receives 57 cents,"" Catalan sports commentator Ernest Macia told CNN. ""There is a feeling of injustice regarding the fiscal system."" ""Also there are the constant political attacks in terms of linguistic policy. For Catalonia the language is very important. Catalan is different from Spanish language, not better or worse, just different. ""The Spanish government is trying to erode the educational system where in Catalonia you study in Catalan but also Spanish ... the government is trying to regain the power in the education system."" So on Sunday in a demonstration of national pride, 98,000 placards will turn the Nou Camp into a giant Catalan flag emblazoned with the word ""Barca!"" prior to kick off. ""It symbolizes the Catalan sentiment,"" continued Macia. ""It's the color of the Catalan flag. People come to enjoy the football, yes, but also to make clear it is a time to be Catalan."" The Catalan nationalism cause has a powerful supporter in the shape of iconic former Barca coach Josep Guardiola, who led the team to 14 trophies during a glittering four seasons in charge. Speaking from New York, where he is currently living, Guardiola delivered a video message of support to his native region on Catalonia's national day, saying: ""Here's one more vote for independence."" Despite the views of one of its favorite sons, the football club is less forthright in extolling the virtues of independence, reflecting that not all Barca fans are against a unified Spain. However, Macia suggests the success of Barcelona's football team and the views of some of the region's other top sport stars has helped promote the idea of self governance. ""I would say there is an increasing union around Barcelona of people who didn't necessarily care about the independence of Catalonia but now understand the reasons through football and the club's other sports teams,"" added Macia. ""Sarunas Jasikevicius, a Lithuanian basketball player for Barcelona, said he is open to independence. ""In football, the team is less explicit. Xavi and Carles Puyol, for example are proud to be Catalan but they haven't said openly they would play for Catalonia instead of Spain."" Catalonia even has its own national football team, though it is not allowed to participate in World Cups or European Championships. The team, which has been playing fixtures since 1912, are permitted to play matches but are barred from participating in competitions which Spain also contests. Over the years, Catalonia's best players such as Xavi, Guardiola and Puyol have pulled on the red and gold shirt alongside ""guest"" stars such as Johan Cruyff and Hristo Stoichkov. But it is Barca, with its core of local players, which has come to represent Catalan footballing honor and so fixtures with Real have a tendency to become ill-tempered. Red cards and the red mist have become the norm. In August 2011 Real coach Jose Mourinho poked Tito Vilanova -- Guardiola's then assistant who has gone on to replace him in the hotseat -- in the eye during a touchline fracas. In 2000 Luis Figo was the subject of Barca fans' ire after moving to Real, and when he returned to the Nou Camp as one of Madrid's fabled ""Galacticos"", the Portuguese forward was pelted with objects including cigarette lighters, cell phones and a pig's head. However, rather than breed contempt, familiarity seems to have begun to blunt this rivalry. Last season the teams played each other on six occasions, after five meetings during the 2010-11 campaign. ""There have been an awful lot of Clasicos over the last few years, which really has diluted things quite a bit,"" said Madrid-based Spanish football expert Tim Stannard. ""It's not like it was even 12 months ago, when you had Mourinho and Guardiola really kicking off at each other. ""We had the two SuperCup Clasicos recently and nothing happened then. We actually had two calm and quite exciting games."" And just as in the rest of Spain, the people of Madrid have worries which are more pressing than whether Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi is the world's best footballer as unemployment climbed to nearly 25 percent last month. Recent protests against anti-austerity measures taken by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government led to violent confrontations between civilians and police on the streets of the capital. ""What we saw was a situation gone bad,"" continued Stannard. ""Some protestors were infiltrated by those looking for a riot. Almost all the time demonstrations here go very peacefully, that's why it made the news. ""There haven't really been any instances since. People are just suffering at the minute."" With Real currently trailing table-toppers Barca by eight points heading into the first league Clasico of the season, the Madrid club's fans haven't had much to cheer either. Despite that start which has seen Mourinho team drop eight points in its first six matches, Stannard suggests this weekend's match offers Real fans brief respite from a dark financial climate. ""It's a distraction from the grim reality of life for many in Spain at the moment,"" he said. ""It gives them something to smile about. This Clasico is not a massively hyped one. In recent years we have had Champions League semifinals and all this bitterness built up between the two teams. A lot of that has been taken out of it."" And what do Madrilenos make of calls for Catalan independence? ""It's hard to speak for everyone here, Madrid is very diverse,"" responded Stannard. ""A lot of people simply don't care."" Back in Barcelona, Macia suggested Spain's financial woes might have given the campaign for Catalan secession extra impetus. ""The feeling is that it has probably helped to create new converts to the independence movement,"" he said. ""In Germany, the richer states give 4% to the GDP, to the central government. ""In Catalonia, it is 8% and everyone in Catalonia is becoming more conscious of the problem."" Macia remains hopeful he will see a day when Catalonia has true independence from Spain. ""It will be very slow,"" he said. ""It will take some time and some verbal violence. I'm not happy to live in this moment, because from Spain come some insults from Catalonia. ""I think both parties will reach an agreement. I'm not sure if it will be to celebrate a democratic referendum. It will probably take at least another year.""","Barcelona face Real Madrid on Sunday in ""El Clasico""

"The sons of at least three government ministers, the head of a public bank, several bureaucrats and high-profile businessmen were detained by Turkish police Tuesday as part of a sweeping corruption probe, state-run media reported. Analysts called the move a signal of the growing rift within Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party ahead of local elections in the spring. The detentions came after a two-year probe by the Istanbul Prosecutor's Office into allegations of corruption including money laundering, gold smuggling and bribery, according to the semi-official Anadolu news agency. Police carried out dawn raids in Istanbul and Ankara, according to local media, including the headquarters of Halkbank, a public bank that was alleged to play a role in sidelining sanctions on Iran in a gold-for-oil scheme last year. The sons of Interior Minister Muammer Guler, Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan and Environment and Urban Planning Minister Erdogan Bayraktar were detained in the raids, according to local media. The head of a large construction company, Ali Agaoglu, was also brought in within the scope of the investigation, though the CEO of the company later told Dogan News Agency that Agaoglu was not the focus of the investigation. Local commentators and analysts see the raids as the most public confirmation of the developing rift between Erdogan's ruling party and supporters of Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric living in Pennsylvania whose loose network of followers are thought to hold key positions within the judiciary and police force. The Hizmet Movement, the name preferred by Gulen's followers, has in the past thrown its support behind the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, led by Erdogan, but the two have been publicly at odds over the last month. ""It was a forced marriage and now it's an ugly divorce,"" said Ahmet Sik, a journalist who wrote a book on Gulen and his influence within the judiciary and the police force. Last month, Erdogan announced that he would shut down college admission tutorial centers, a large source of revenue and recruitment opportunity for the Gulenists. On Monday, Hakan Sukur -- a former footballer and Gulen follower who was elected to parliament on the AKP party ticket -- resigned from the party, citing the government's stance on tutorial centers. ""This is all a judicial process, it would not be right for me to say anything until the outcome,"" Erdogan told reporters in Konya. But in a fiery speech he delivered there he said ""those who are receiving the support of financial circles and media cannot change the direction of this country. Those who are supported by dark circles from inside and outside the country cannot change the direction of Turkey."" Turkey is expected to hold local elections in 2014 and many analysts see this as a test of Erdogan's grip on power after a turbulent year of unprecedented anti-government protests.","Analysts say the detentions show rift within Erdogan's party .

"One year after the Boston Marathon bombings and almost three years after his death in a CIA drone strike in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki, the New Mexico-born American cleric who was an operational leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, continues to be a major influence on violent jihadist extremists in the United States. Even in death, al-Awlaki is the key cleric in the English-speaking world of radical Islam that militants are turning to for inspiration. His many lectures and interviews are still widely available on the Internet, and they are in colloquial English to boot. Al-Awlaki, for instance, influenced the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings. Al-Awlaki was born in 1971 in Las Cruces, New Mexico, where his father was studying agricultural economics at New Mexico State University as a Fulbright scholar. As an undergrad, al-Awlaki attended Colorado State University, studying engineering. In 1994 while living in Colorado, al-Awlaki married his first wife, a cousin from Yemen. A year later, al-Awlaki moved to San Diego, where he took up a job as a cleric at a local mosque. By his own account, it was during this period that al-Awlaki began to develop a hatred for the United States, feelings he was quite adept at keeping to himself. This hatred was sparked by the first Gulf War, which followed Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Six months later a massive American army based in Saudi Arabia expelled Hussein's troops from Kuwait. After Hussein's armies were ignominiously pushed out of Kuwait, a large-scale U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia continued for many years. For politicized, fundamentalist Muslims such as al-Awlaki, the presence of thousands of ""infidel"" American troops on the holy land of Saudi Arabia was a deep irritant. During his years living in San Diego and later in Virginia, al-Awlaki met with three of the 9/11 hijackers in the months before the attacks. Almost a decade later he also gave the order to Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the ""underwear bomber"" to take down an American plane with a bomb. AbdulMutallab ignited his bomb on Northwest Flight 253 on Christmas Day 2009 as it flew over the suburbs of Detroit, but luckily the device failed to detonate properly. As a result of the operational role al-Awlaki was playing in al Qaeda, President Barack Obama gave the authorization for his death, and on the morning of September 30, 2011, CIA drones locked on to the vehicle he was traveling in Yemen and fired missiles that killed the cleric. Obama called the death of al-Awlaki a ""major blow"" to al-Qaeda in Yemen, which had now lost its ""leader of external operations."" But it turns out that killing the militant cleric was easier than killing his ideas that linger on in the virtual world. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the younger brother who survived a shootout with police shortly after the Boston Marathon bombings, had downloaded articles written by al-Awlaki, according to the indictment against him. Tsarnaev also downloaded the first issue of Inspire magazine, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's English-language webzine, which al-Awlaki helped to produce. Law enforcement officials linked the pipe bombs allegedly used by the Tsarnaev brothers in the Boston Marathon bombings to step-by-step instructions for how to build similar pipe bombs that were printed in that first issue of Inspire. The Tsarnaev brothers may not be the only individuals in the United States to have been influenced by al-Awlaki. According to a count by the New America Foundation, since 9/11, 52 American citizens or U.S. residents indicted in a jihadist terrorist-related crime or that have been killed have cited al-Awlaki as an influence, possessed his propaganda or were in communication or met with him. Al-Awlaki was in e-mail communication, for instance, with Maj. Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 people in a shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009. Nor are the Tsarnaevs the only Americans likely to be influenced by Inspire magazine.  According to a count by the New America Foundation, at least 16 individuals indicted since the magazine's first issue in 2010 have possessed or cited Inspire as an influence. Even today, court documents continue to cite al-Awlaki and Inspire as influencing factors in terrorism cases. Eighteen individuals indicted in the United States since al-Awlaki's death in 2011 have cited his influence or possessed his propaganda. In June, for instance, Justin Kaliebe, an 18-year-old New Yorker, pleaded guilty to attempting to travel to Yemen to join al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  According to his plea agreement, Kaliebe told an undercover officer, ""My standard is Sheik Anwar Al-Awlaki and Sheik Osama (bin Laden), both who bore witness to the truth."" In November, the government indicted Basit Sheikh, a 29-year-old living in North Carolina, and charged him with attempting to provide material support to al-Nusra Front, a Syrian al Qaeda affiliate. The criminal complaint alleges that Sheikh posted a link on Facebook to a propaganda video narrated by al-Awlaki. In December, the government filed an indictment against Terry Loewen, a 58-year-old man from Wichita, Kansas, alleging he attempted to explode a car bomb at the Wichita Mid-Continent Airport. The criminal complaint alleges that Loewen told an undercover FBI informant, ""Brothers like Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki are a great inspiration to me,"" and, ""I have read Anwar Al-Awlaki's 44 ways of Jihad, and like everything l've ever read of his, it's very informative."" In March, Nicholas Teausant, a 20-year-old from Acampo, California, was arrested and charged with attempting to travel to fight in Syria. The criminal complaint alleges that Teausant's computer contained copies and excerpts of Inspire. It is not just the U.S. government that continues to view al-Awlaki as maintaining, even in death, his power to influence. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula continues to publish Inspire. The latest issue appeared in March featuring a purported interview with al-Awlaki made before his death in which he urged attacks on Western civilians. Al Qaeda and individuals motivated by the group's ideology continue to view al-Awlaki as an important voice so his writings, available on the Internet, will likely continue to crop up in terrorism cases for the foreseeable future. What can be done to counter this? An implausible approach is a ""takedown"" effort. Trying to eliminate al-Awlaki's writings on ""holy war"" on the Internet just won't work. Eliminate them on some sites, and they will simply pop up on others. Another more plausible approach would be for English-speaking Muslim clerics to contest publicly and widely al-Awlaki's arguments for justified holy wars against non-Muslims. So far such efforts remain limited both in number and reach.","Peter Bergen says a terrorist killed in a U.S. drone strike continues to influence jihadists .

"The death toll in last week's collapse of a guesthouse at a church run by a famous Nigerian preacher has risen to at least 70, a rescue agency official said Wednesday. Rescuers have helped 131 other people out of the rubble and still are looking for more survivors from Friday's collapse of the two-story guesthouse at The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations, Nigerian Emergency Management Agency spokesman Ibrahim Farinloye told reporters at the collapse site. The building, at the church run by televangelist T.B. Joshua in the Ikotun area of Lagos, came down Friday afternoon amid work to build additional floors, NEMA said. Farinloye said NEMA hasn't identified the victims. On Tuesday, South African President Jacob Zuma said 67 South Africans were among the dead. ""This is a particularly difficult time for South Africa. Not in the recent history of our country have we had this large number of our people die in one incident outside the country,"" he said, according to a statement released by the President's office Tuesday. NEMA said an investigation into the cause hasn't begun. But on its Facebook page Friday, NEMA said that two stories were being added without fortifying the foundation of the initial structure, and that there was a ""high probability"" this is what led to the collapse. Joshua, dubbed ""The Prophet"" for his self-acclaimed healing powers and prophesies, has a large following among Nigerians and followers across the world. His church attracts thousands of followers who attend every week to listen to his sermons, which are also telecast live on the church's television station. ""People travel from around the world to witness and receive from the mighty work that God is doing in the life of Prophet TB Joshua,"" the church's website says.","Official: 131 people have been rescued from the rubble of the collapsed guesthouse .

"(CNN) -- If you're even remotely familiar with Boston's Southie neighborhood and the Irish gangs that once dominated it, you know who James ""Whitey"" Bulger is. Bulger eluded federal authorities for more than 16 years before his arrest in June 2011. Now 85, Bulger is a convicted murderer, serving the rest of his life in prison for a litany of crimes, including his role in 11 murders, although he's appealing his conviction. His crimes were thoroughly detailed throughout his high-profile murder trial, but here are six things you might not know about this infamous Boston gang leader: . 1. He'd rather be in Alcatraz . Already in prison for armed robbery, Bulger was sent to the now-defunct federal prison on Alcatraz Island off San Francisco's shoreline in November 1959 after allegedly planning a prison escape in Atlanta. He spent three years in Alcatraz before his eventual release in 1965. Shortly after Bulger's 2011 capture, Alcatraz historian and author Michael Esslinger wrote to the imprisoned Bulger asking for details about his time in the notorious federal penitentiary. Much to Esslinger's surprise, Bulger wrote back extensively about his fond memories of his time in Alcatraz. Esslinger told CBS' Bill Whitaker that Bulger wrote, ""'If I could choose my epitaph on my tombstone, it would be 'I'd rather be in Alcatraz.' '"" Bulger apparently liked Alcatraz so much that he went back there as a tourist. There's even a photo of a smiling Bulger with his then-girlfriend Teresa Stanley dressed in mock prison garb. 2. Volunteered for LSD testing in prison . While imprisoned in Atlanta for the bank robbery conviction in 1957, Bulger volunteered to be a drug test subject in an effort to reduce his prison sentence. Bulger was injected with LSD -- a not-so-well-known drug at the time -- for what he thought was an effort to find a cure for schizophrenia, according to Kevin Cullen and Shelley Murphy, authors of ""Whitey Bulger: America's Most Wanted Gangster And The Manhunt That Brought Him To Justice."" Bulger said he suffered from lifelong insomnia and nightmares as a result of the experiment. He later learned that the experiments were actually part of the CIA's so-called MKULTRA program to develop a mind-control weapon carried out at dozens of universities and institutions from 1953 to 1967, according to T.J. English, author of ""Whitey's Payback,"" citing two of Bulger's associates. ""(Bulger) was enraged to learn how the covert program had destroyed so many lives,"" English wrote in The Daily Beast. ""According to (Bulger's associate Kevin) Weeks, Bulger had even taken preliminary steps to track down the overseer of the program, Dr. Carl Pfeiffer ... and assassinate him,"" English wrote. 3. Only known son died at age 6 . Bulger and girlfriend Lindsey Cyr had been dating only a few months in 1966 when Cyr became pregnant. Bulger wasn't pleased, so when the baby was born in May 1967, Cyr listed her ex-boyfriend as the boy's father on the birth certificate. Speaking publicly for the first time in 2010, Cyr told The Boston Globe that Bulger also kept his son's identity a secret to protect him from his father's numerous enemies. Despite his initial reluctance toward fatherhood, Cyr said Bulger doted on the boy. ""He helped pay for child care and showered Douglas with toys,"" wrote the Globe's Cullen and Murphy. As Bulger rose through the ranks of Boston's Winter Hill Gang in 1973, 6-year-old Douglas fell ill and was hospitalized with Reye's Syndrome, a severe reaction to aspirin. Bulger sat by his side for three days, wrote Cullen and Murphy. ""When he died, Jimmy (Bulger) was out of his mind,"" Cyr is quoted as saying in Cullen and Murphy's book. 4. He was honorably discharged from the military despite arrests . Bulger served nearly four years in the U.S. Air Force, working as an aircraft mechanic and earning his high school diploma. Yet the future gang leader never strayed far from trouble. During his military service, the young Bulger was arrested for going AWOL and, in a separate incident, police arrested him on rape charges. He was never convicted or sentenced on either charge and received an honorable discharge in 1952. 5. He hated the nickname 'Whitey' Nearly every mobster has a colorful nickname, but family and associates say Bulger hated ""Whitey,"" a reference to his white-blond hair as a child. He preferred his real name, Jim, and reportedly he was also OK with the moniker ""Boots,"" which referred to his fondness for cowboy boots. 6. You can apparently rent his old apartment . During the time that Bulger spent eluding authorities, he and girlfriend Catherine Greig lived as Charlie and Carol Gasko in a seaside apartment in Santa Monica, California. In his letters to Esslinger, Bulger described that time as ""a 16-year honeymoon."" A neighbor described the couple as a quiet and polite, who sometimes helped carry her groceries. Three months ago, the seaside apartment was put up for rent, according to several media reports. The ""unassuming two bedroom apartment"" can be yours ""for $2,950 a month -- far more than Bulger himself had paid during his rent-controlled stint there,"" according to  The Hollywood Reporter. It's the same apartment where federal agents found more than $822,000 in cash hidden inside the walls after his capture.","James ""Whitey"" Bulger was sentenced to life in prison in 2013 .

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned U.N. delegates Monday not to overlook the threats posed by Iran and Hamas in their zeal to defeat the terror group ISIS. ""Ladies and gentlemen, would you let ISIS enrich uranium? Would you let ISIS build a heavy-water reactor? Would you let ISIS develop intercontinental ballistic missiles. Of course, you wouldn't,""  Netanyahu said. ""Then you mustn't let the Islamic state of Iran do those things either, because here's what will happen,"" he said. ""Once Iran produces atomic bombs, all the charms and all the smiles will suddenly disappear. They'll just vanish. And it's then that the ayatollahs will show their true face and unleash their aggressive fanaticism on the entire world."" Netanyahu praised the growing effort to defeat ISIS, the militant group that has seized large swaths of Syria and Iraq, but simultaneously chastised many of the countries joining that coalition for failing, he said, to recognize that ISIS and Hamas ""are branches of the same poisonous tree."" ""For the militant Islamists, all politics is global,"" he said. ""Because their ultimate goal is to dominate the world. Now that threat might seem exaggerated to some, since it starts out small, like a cancer that attacks a particular part of the body. But left unchecked, the cancer grows, metastasizing over wider and wider areas. ""To protect the peace and the security of the world, we must remove this cancer before it's too late,"" he said. He also compared militant Islamists to the Nazis who led Germany in World War II, saying extremists today seek world domination, as did Adolf Hitler's minions. ""The Nazis believed in a master race. The militant Islamists believe in a master faith,"" he said. ""They just disagree who among them will be the master of the master faith. That's what they truly disagree about."" Netanyahu's speech was a ""blatant manipulation of the facts,"" Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in statement issued shortly after the speech. ""Blaming the victim has always been the failed policy of the politically and morally bankrupt, and Netanyahu is no exception,"" Ashrawi said.","World must contain Iran and Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister tells United Nations .

"(CNN)It's hard to picture Stan Wawrinka in the mold of tennis firebrands like John McEnroe or Andy Roddick but the Australian Open champion does admit to occasionally picking a row with the chair umpire to ""pump him up"" while playing. While some might say this shows a lack of respect for the officialdom, Wawrinka believes their authority has already been undermined by an over reliance on the Hawk-Eye electronic line judging system, which was first introduced at a top-level tennis tournament late in 2005. Roddick, who retired in 2012, recently called for Hawk-Eye to be scrapped, arguing that controversial arguments between players and umpires helped to boost TV ratings and draw crowds to tennis matches. ""It's helped a lot for the players to make sure the call is right and you can prove it."" Wawrinka told CNN's Open Court . ""But it doesn't help the umpire at all anymore. They don't really take control of the match, leaving it to the players and Hawk-Eye. ""They don't have to take responsibility for mistakes,"" he added. The world No. 4 also pointed to an inconsistency whereby many matches on the ATP Tour are played on outside courts without the system installed, leading to umpires being caught between two styles of officiating. ""When an umpire is used to not taking responsibility and not overruling (an incorrect line call) when the match is played on a smaller court he's not going to do anything. ""That's not good for the game,"" said Wawrinka. The Swiss star is seemingly not adverse to having it out with umpires in the heat of the moment. ""Yes, it's good -- it makes you pumped,"" said the 29-year-old Wawrinka. Last year in his Australian Open four-set final victory over Rafael Nadal, Wawrinka became embroiled in a spat with the chair umpire after the Spaniard left the court to have treatment on his injured back without the Swiss player being told the nature of the injury. ""If he's off you have to tell me why!' Wawrinka shouted. A year later Wawrinka is playing down his chances of repeating that 2014 triumph, picking world No. 1 Novak Djokovic as the ""big favorite"" along with his compatriot and 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer. The pair combined to help Switzerland win the Davis Cup for the first time, beating France in last month's final. ""It was an amazing feeling -- especially winning like that with Roger on the team,"" said Wawrinka. Wawrinka, who plays Romania's Marius Copil Thursday, believes he has the armory to beat any of the ""top three"" as he did last year in seeing of Djokovic and Nadal in successive matches in Melbourne. ""When I go on the court against Roger, Rafa or Novak .. I know I can beat him and how I made this happen."" The confidence comes from his tremendous performances in 2014, with his first Masters 1000 success coming on the clay of Monte Carlo to be added to his Australian Open and Davis Cup triumphs. It elevated ""Stan"" to superstar status around the world and he admits it was difficult to adjust to his new found fame as he suffered some surprise losses among the standout victories. ""I think for sure last year everything changed. It's a different level -- as you know when you win a grand slam -- you are part of the history of tennis. ""I had to adapt a little bit --especially mentally to find my way to be the same on the court and off the court -- that's why I had some up and down days all the year."" Another release valve has been social media, with Wawrinka regularly updating his Twitter account to keep his fans in touch with his progress. ""It's a little bit more private because you can say or give what you want -- picture, different picture,"" he said. So sure enough, when Wawrinka made a successful defense of his Chennai Open title in India, his final warmup before the Australian Open, he was quickly tweeting. The popular world No. 4 for will be hoping to relay news of his second grand slam title on the final day in Melbourne on February 1st.","Stan Wawrinka weighs into debate on Hawkeye line judging system .

"(CNN) -- When change comes, it comes all of a sudden, leaving only a remembrance of the past, a previous present, as its memorial. A moment as sudden as British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's realization that there was a ""wind of change blowing through this continent, whether we like it or not"" prior to the granting of independence to so many African people 50 years ago. It is this wind that now blows again over Africa. This time it is less political than economic but it will be just as permanent and just as shocking. And this time, it will not be awkward majors from disbanded colonial battalions muttering into their beer, it will be our well-meaning liberals that will be left behind, lumpen in its wake like a broken Luddite army. This change will not happen because of a million posters showing our babies starving with flies in their eyes or the perpetual funds raised for mosquito nets as a panacea against our ineffective drainage systems. Though the lives of many millions were saved by campaigns such as these. It will come as swift as our Tunisian Spring, a revolution sprung by social media, and as insistent as the ringtone of our mobile phones. Read this: Latest African gold rush - hotels . Between 2000 and 2012, mobile penetration grew in Africa from 1% to 54%. Some predict that by 2014, 69% of mobiles on the continent will have internet access. This virtual infrastructure, plus the commodity boom, has meant that 7 out of 10 of the world's fastest growing economies including, yes, Ethiopia, the poster child of our Live Aid generation, are not in Asia but in Africa. This does not mean change will be evenly spread; it won't. The rapid urbanization and consequent youth unemployment will cause great hardship for many. The lack of administrative infrastructure to deal with this will ensure taxes are not collected and the facilities left to cope with this are not built or are built in the wrong place. Aid will continue to be a necessary feature of Africa . But despite this the realization has come that Africa is not poor but inestimably rich. And that the outright despicable, as well as our supposed friends, have been writing cheques off our backs since the day they granted an indentured independence. History will show that Africa gave more than it ever received - it is the true donor nation. Yet despite this, Africa is throwing off its 300-year yoke. Much as China did. China, too, suffered its post-colonial period, drunk on nationalism and at best neglected by its dictators. And in many ways, Africa's growth patterns mirror those of the new China's. In 2010 China ranked first in exports to the world market, with merchandise export sales of more than $1.5 trillion and a world market share of 10.4%. In 1998, China had less than 2% of the world market. Africa has presently 3% but with 15% of the world's population, 60% of world's uncultivated arable land and a fast-growing proportion of the world's discovered valuable natural resources, Africa's potential for growth over the next 10 years is greater than China's over the same period. Read this: Africa's skyscraper cities . Charles Robertson, Global Chief Economist of Renaissance Capital, estimates that Africa's GDP will increase from $2 trillion to $29 trillion in today's money by 2050. Africa will produce more GDP than the combined economies of the U.S. and Eurozone do today. In 2007, I co-hosted with the then Ghanaian president John Kufour, a dinner for 50 of the African presidents and explained how these changes would come. Back then, these words floated like fairy tales but they are becoming commonplace now in investment circles: Africa is Rising. Last week, I returned with my Made In Africa Foundation, this time to the African Development Bank (AfDB) during its annual general meeting, in its 50th Anniversary year, to ensure that as this growth happens it benefits not just everyone else in the developed and the BRIC economies but Africans as well and in a fundamental and equitable way. That's why I invited John Legend, Mos Def and Isaiah Washington, Youssou N'Dour and Akon to come along too, to advocate for the AfDB's audacious $68 billion PIDA plan to transform the continent in building railways, roads, clean water supplies and those things we take for granted -- the basic infrastructure of communication and trade to enable worthwhile lives for all our people. The AfDB's plan is to raise funds through a guarantee backed by the African nations: Africa helping Africans -- the ultimate trade-not-aid policy. As Mos Def said to the philanthropist Kola Aluko, one of Nigeria's richest men: ""It's about self-sufficiency and about how Africa can benefit itself, having benefited so many nations through its natural resources, history, culture and its people and now it's about a fair exchange and what Africa can do for itself."" Watch: Made in Africa Foundation . I mixed these great talents from the diaspora and Africa in amongst the finance ministers, bankers and entrepreneurs. This is what a designer looks for: the harmony in contrasts. They find their common desire to make it happen -- one group bringing this solution to the global audience, giving it transparency and encouraging investment, and the other group implementing it. That's why I set up Made In Africa Foundation with the support of a fast-growing Nigerian business, Atlantic Energy. The message is quite simple: A small group of nations cannot forever benefit from keeping the majority of nations and people in a state of weakness. The peoples and continents of the world are not separate, they are part of the same social and economic system: a system that must return to balance and harmony. But this balance can only occur when Africa itself realizes that it is time for Africa. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ozwald Boateng.","Ozwald Boateng says Africa is in the midst of an economic boom .

"A day after Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for lighter economic sanctions, the difference in the moods on the streets of Tehran and Jerusalem couldn't be starker. ""I'm very happy about this agreement,"" one man told CNN in Tehran. ""We hope all the world knows we use this nuclear (power) just for peace, not for war."" With the exception of extreme hard-liners, most Iranians are extremely happy with the deal, especially after many rounds of negotiations that yielded no results. Iranian newspapers lauded the agreement, with one proclaiming on the front page: ""This is Iran, and everyone is happy."" But just across the region in Jerusalem, many residents echoed the sentiments of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who slammed the deal as ""a historic mistake."" A political cartoon in one local newspaper depicts Israel's foreign minister as saying, ""I'll find us new friends"" -- an apparent jab at the United States and other allies that supported the deal. Israeli team goes to Washington . An Israeli team headed by National Security Adviser Yossi Cohen will leave soon for the United States to discuss the agreement, Netanyahu said Monday. That plan was worked out in a conversation with U.S. President Barack Obama on Sunday night, the Israeli Prime Minister said. ""I would be happy if I could join those voices around the world that are praising the Geneva agreement. It is true that the international pressure which we applied was partly successful and has led to a better result than what was originally planned, but this is still a bad deal. It reduces the pressure on Iran without receiving anything tangible in return, and the Iranians who laughed all the way to the bank are themselves saying that this deal has saved them."" The agreement, Netanyahu said, ""must lead to one result: The dismantling of Iran's military nuclear capability. I remind you that only last week, during the talks, the leaders of Iran repeated their commitment to destroy the State of Israel, and I reiterate here today my commitment, as Prime Minister of Israel, to prevent them from achieving the ability to do so."" Tehran has continued its incendiary statements against Israel even in recent weeks. During negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israeli officials ""cannot be even called humans"" and referred to Netanyahu as ""the rabid dog of the region."" What the deal means . Iranian officials and the P5+1 countries -- the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany -- hashed out the plan in Geneva early Sunday morning. Even though it's only a six-month deal, world leaders hope it'll pave the way to a long-term guarantee that Iran won't produce nuclear weapons. And Iran hopes to recoup some of the billions of dollars it's lost as a result of international sanctions. World powers will suspend sanctions on various items, including gold and petrochemical exports. That suspension will provide Iran with about $1.5 billion in revenue, according to the White House. Iran has stumbled from one economic crisis to the next under the sanctions, and unemployment currently runs over 24%. But not every country is following suit. Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird said his country will maintain its sanctions on Iran. ""People of #Iran deserve freedom & prosperity denied them by regime's nuclear ambitions,"" Baird tweeted. ""Until then, Canadian sanctions remain in full force."" 'Most thuggish people' It's also unclear whether Congress will agree to the deal.  Sen. Lindsey Graham, a prominent Republican on the Appropriations, Armed Services, Budget, and Judiciary committees, called Monday for a new round of sanctions that can be relieved only if Iran dismantles its plutonium reactor. The end game is to stop enrichment, he said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""We're dealing with people who are not only untrustworthy, this is a murderous regime that murders their own people, creates chaos and mayhem throughout the whole world, the largest sponsor of terrorism. And we're treating them out of sync with who they are. That's what bothers me so much. This deal doesn't represent the fact we're dealing with the most thuggish people in the whole world."" Since the deal is temporary, it remains unclear what world powers might offer -- and demand of -- Iran in the future. ""It's a little too early to break open champagne bottles and put on the party hats on this one,"" said Middle East diplomatic expert Aaron David Miller.  ""Its success hinges on whether or not it leads to a bigger agreement to ""put Iran's nuclear weapons program to rest."" That the diplomats came to any accord at all represents a momentous budge in a nearly 35-year deadlock marked by distrust, suspicion and open animosity between the United States and Iran, which broke off diplomatic relations after Iran's revolution in 1979. It was the first such agreement in 10 years of attempts to negotiate over Iran's nuclear program. Success or setback? In a televised speech, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sold it as a win for his negotiators. ""We are pleased after 10 years that an agreement on this level has been reached,"" he said. He played up the fact that the deal allows Iran to enrich uranium to a level making it usable as nuclear fuel. During the six months of the agreement, he said, major facilities in Iran will continue doing so. But that level, 5% enrichment, is well below the level needed to make weapons. Fareed Zakaria: What critics are getting wrong about the Iran deal . Obama said the agreement includes ""substantial limitations that will help prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon."" The President defended the interim deal, saying in San Francisco on Monday that the United States ""cannot close the door on diplomacy."" ""Tough talk and bluster may be the easy thing to do politically, but it's not the right thing to do for our security,"" he said. Some Republican opponents in Washington agreed with Israeli officials, saying the plan will actually help in Iran's alleged quest for a bomb. ""This agreement shows other rogue states that wish to go nuclear that you can obfuscate, cheat, and lie for a decade, and eventually the United States will tire and drop key demands,"" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said. Netanyahu: obligation to defend . Netanyahu adamantly distrusts Iran and decried the agreement as a ""historic mistake"" Sunday. Now that sanctions are working, Netanyahu wants to see them tightened, not loosened, until Iran shuts down much of its nuclear capability. The agreement does not apply to Israel, he said Sunday. If need be, Israel will take matters into its own hands. ""The regime in Iran is dedicated to destroying Israel, and Israel has the right and obligation to defend itself with its own forces against every threat,"" Netanyahu said. Israeli President Shimon Peres backed up Netanyahu, but also extended an olive branch. ""I would like to say to the Iranian people: You are not our enemies and we are not yours,"" he said. ""There is a possibility to solve this issue diplomatically,"" Peres said. Read the deal (PDF)","Obama defends temporary deal, which limits Iran's nuclear program .

"(CNN) -- Former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic, accused of masterminding ""ethnic cleansing"" deportations and killings of Bosnian Muslims and Croats, has been arrested after more than a decade in hiding, a U.N. war crimes tribunal said Monday. Radovan Karadzic, shown here in 1995, is charged with war crimes relating to the 1992-1995 Bosnia conflict. Karadzic, 63, is charged with genocide, crimes against humanity and violations of the law of war. Last seen in public in 1996, Karadzic was the Bosnian Serb political leader during the 1992-1995 war that followed Bosnia-Herzegovina's secession from Yugoslavia. The conflict included the Srebrenica massacre of thousands of Bosnian Muslims and a deadly, 44-month siege of Sarajevo. Former U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke blamed Karadzic for all the deaths in the three-year war in Bosnia, which had the bloodiest of the Balkan conflicts that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia. ""Without Radovan Karadzic, this thing wouldn't have happened,"" Holbrooke told CNN.  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour explain Karadzic's rise and fall » . Early estimates of the death toll from the three-year war ranged up to 300,000, but recent research concluded about 100,000 were killed. Vladimir Petrovic, the charge d'affairs at the Serbian Embassy in Washington, said his government's security forces made the arrest, but said no further details had been released. ""I think this is an example that the Serbian government is committed to all its international obligations and that it will continue cooperation with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,"" Petrovic said. Serge Brammertz, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, congratulated Serbian authorities for taking Karadzic into custody and called it ""an important day for the victims."" ""It is also an important day for international justice, because it clearly demonstrates that nobody is beyond the reach of the law and that sooner or later all fugitives will be brought to justice,"" Brammertz said. He said authorities ""in due course"" will determine when Karadzic is to be transferred to the tribunal at The Hague. Karadzic's arrest leaves former Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military commander, as the top-ranking war crimes suspect still at large. ""While this is an important milestone, the work of the International Tribunal will not be complete until all fugitives have been arrested and tried,"" a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said. News of Karadzic's arrest was greeted with jubilation in the streets of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, which Bosnian Serb forces had shelled heavily during the war. ""Today, I can tell you that I feel kind of good,"" said Zlatko Lagumdzija, a former Bosnian prime minister wounded during the siege. He said the arrest could offer ""a chance for new thinking"" in Bosnia, still grappling with the scars of war. ""Today it looks like a new wind is moving from Belgrade,"" he said. ""And I hope it will be a signal to Bosnian authorities that the state has to be set in order to deliver what the state is supposed to deliver: peace and justice."" Karadzic, a one-time psychiatrist and self-styled poet, declared himself president of a Bosnian Serb republic when Bosnia-Herzegovina seceded from Yugoslavia in 1992. The Bosnian Serbs, backed by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav military and paramilitary forces, quickly seized control of most of the country and laid siege to Sarajevo, the capital. During the conflict that followed, the Serb forces launched what they called the ""ethnic cleansing"" of the territories under their control -- the forced displacement and killings of Muslims and Croats. Among the crimes Karadzic is accused of overseeing is the massacre at Srebrenica, a U.N. ""safe area"" overrun by Serb troops in July 1995. Nearly 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed at Srebrenica, the worst European massacre since World War II. During the siege of Sarajevo, ""shelling and sniping killed and wounded thousands of civilians of both sexes and all ages, including children and the elderly,"" according to the U.N. tribunal's indictment of Karadzic. He was removed from power in 1995, when the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office. But he remained ""kind of a Robin Hood"" to Serbs during more than a decade as a fugitive, said Holbrooke, one of the architects of the Dayton Accords. Serbia's government has been under increasing pressure to arrest war crimes suspects such as Karadzic and Mladic -- who were believed to be in hiding in Serbia rather than Bosnia. The European Union warned in December that any steps toward allowing Serbia into the organization would depend on its cooperation with the war crimes tribunal.","Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has been arrested in Serbia .

"""This is the house?"" my mom asks, turning around. ""Yes,"" says our guide. ""This is where your grandmother was born."" My mother and I have traveled more than 6,000 miles to explore Candia Canavese, a tiny village outside Torino, Italy, founded in the fifth century. We're here to learn more about our heritage and get a sense of where her family is from. We're not the first ones to visit for that reason. Even though Candia Canavese has a population of just 1,200, our guide says plenty of other travelers have come searching for records, data, photos and that intangible sense of history you can't get without visiting a place yourself. Interest in genealogy appears to be at an all-time high, with a recent Harris Interactive Survey indicating that four in five Americans wish to learn more about their family history. Shows like CNN's upcoming ""Roots: Our journeys home,"" along with series ""Who do You Think You Are?"" and ""Finding Your Roots"" are gaining in popularity. ""People see these programs and they want that experience for themselves,""  says Michelle Ercanbrack, family historian at Ancestry.com. As a result, she says, more travelers are looking to incorporate family history research into a trip or even plan a standalone journey for the sole purpose of discovering their roots. Want to embark on your own family tree trip? Here are some tips and techniques to help smooth the process. Get your history organized before you leave . If you're spending the time and money to get to a far-flung destination, you don't want to spend your visit stuck in a library or office. It's more rewarding to get your history organized before you leave. ""Start with what you know and build your tree online,"" says Ercanbrack. Sites like Ancestry.com, Familysearch.org and Genealogy.com can get you on the right track, while genealogy research site Cyndislist.com has a comprehensive collection of useful links. For example, Ancestry.com has 14 billion searchable, indexed records -- everything from passenger records to census data and more. ""Remember, online records can build the branches, but there will be holes -- things you can't find because of records loss or privacy details,"" Ercanbrack adds. Beyond just building out a family tree skeleton online, it's also wise to create a historical timeline before your trip.  A snapshot of the family's movements will help you see holes easier. For example, start with one family member -- say a grandparent -- and create a timeline of where and when they were born, where they lived, went to school, were married, and so forth. Writing things down in a narrative fashion can help you pinpoint gaps, like when a child might have been born or a family member emigrated. Let them know you're coming . Regardless if where in the world family history travel takes you, it helps to get in touch with a few locals before you arrive. People worth contacting include librarians, city clerks, museum officers and clergy. Giving information in advance helps a researcher flag potential documents and can maximize time on the ground while visiting. Prior to our Italy trip, my mother and I got in touch with the innkeeper at the one hotel in the village to inquire about an Italian-speaking guide to help us. Our host went above and beyond -- as it turns out his family had lived in the village for generations and knew all the people we needed to speak to. Because we sent information requests with family names and dates in advance, by the time we arrived he had already laid the groundwork and we had appointments with the priest and the city clerk's office. That allowed us to spend a good chunk of our time wandering the streets, taking in the ambiance and imagining how my great-grandmother's family lived. On-site research: Tombstones and immigration offices . Sure, you may have to spend time browsing through old boxes and files searching for documents, but there are countless of other places to find data while visiting a location. ""Visiting the place is where you do the finishing touches,"" says Ercanbrack. Cemeteries: Local cemeteries often provide location-based details you won't find in other files such as place of death. They can also turn up details on previously unknown family members or even children that died as infants and were never recorded. Ercanbrack offers a great tip for getting details off a worn headstone: Shine a flashlight directly above the headstone to cast a shadow on engravings -- you can then take a picture of the shadow. It's far more effective than using the paper-rubbing-with-charcoal technique you see so often in the movies -- that can actually permanently damage the headstone. Immigration offices: Passport applications and naturalization records can be information goldmines, as they often include detailed information on family records, places of residence and work. Military/VA Offices:  Military pension records also are crammed with data including dates and location of service, awards and recognition and time spent overseas. Note that these might be harder to access and there are privacy issues concerning release of some statistics, but worth investigating. By the end of our journey we discovered new details previously blank on the family tree. More importantly, we felt connected to a place that was previously just a spot on the map. As Alex Haley, author of ""Roots,"" so eloquently put it: ""In all of us there is a hunger, marrow-deep, to know our heritage -- to know who we are and where we have come from.  Without this enriching knowledge, there is a hollow yearning.""","Interest in genealogy is rising, with many choosing to combine travel with family history research .

"When Rand Paul, a likely Republican presidential candidate, signed up for the photo-sharing app Shapchat on Wednesday, it set off a predictable round of mockery about the Kentucky senator. Haha! chanted the Greek chorus of Internet snark. Look at this 51-year-old man signing up for the buzzy social media platform in a lame effort to win over The Youngs! ""Rand Paul Officially Ruins Snapchat Forever,"" was Huffington Post's take on the matter. Even the senator himself admitted that edgy social media platforms can be drained of their cool factor once older users try to elbow in on the fun. ""Young people are flocking to it, until the grownups show up and people go somewhere else,"" Paul said in an interview with CNN. Taken together, the blizzard of Rand ridicule contained at least one inarguable kernel of truth: Signing up for neat social apps won't solve the Republican Party's complicated relationship with younger voters. The GOP's collective aversion to same-sex marriage, which is favored by a large majority of Americans under 30, is one bigger obstacle that comes to mind. But politicians -- at least the smart ones -- aren't just flocking to new platforms because they're trying to be hip, though that's certainly part of the calculation. They're joining them because that's increasingly where the voters are. ""It's pretty simple,"" said Wesley Donehue, a Republican consultant who specializes in digital strategy and spends as much time in Silicon Valley as he does in the trenches of national politics. ""Rand Paul is talking to younger voters on a platform where they are spending all their time."" How Americans consume news . During the 2012 presidential campaign, the Pew Center for the People and the Press released a treasure trove of research about how Americans are consuming news. Television remained the No. 1 news source for Americans, but viewership was on the decline, especially among young people. While older people were continuing to tune in at relatively steady rates, less than a third of Americans between age 18 and 24 reported watching television news the previous day, Pew found. And print and radio? Done-zo. Instead, teens and twenty-somethings in 2012 were turning to digital sources and social networking platforms for news -- especially on their mobile phones, where millions of thumbs are constantly scanning Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Vine or Snapchat at all hours of the day and night. This migration of news to the Web, an expansive topic hashed out in a million newspaper obituaries, sober academic studies on ""disruption"" and in gushing articles about the triumph of Buzzfeed, is a phenomenon hardly limited to young consumers. Every day, our Twitter feeds are flooded with some incredible statistic about how Americans across the board are abandoning traditional news and entertainment sources and flocking to digital or on-demand content. Both broadcast and cable television viewership has tumbled across the board, a trend documented by both the ratings and scads of academic studies. Pew released an intriguing one just last week: In 1985, it reported, roughly half of Americans could correctly identify Dan Rather as the anchor of the CBS Evening News, then the top-ranked evening news broadcast in the country. But last year, only 27% of the country could correctly name Brian Williams, who anchors the NBC Nightly News. Put another way, three-quarters of the country has no idea who anchors the highest-rated evening news broadcast in the country. This is the stuff Richard Nixon's dreams were made of. Meanwhile, an entire wing of the Library of Congress could be filled with New York Times style section essays bemoaning our creeping addiction to mobile devices and the Internet. Three-quarters of all adults now regularly use a social networking site, most likely Facebook, which still commands mind-boggling reach despite it's tumbling street cred among young people. There are more active wireless devices in the United States (326 million) than there are human beings (314 million). More than 6 billion hours of video are watched on YouTube every month. CNN's digital platforms (shameless plug) had an average of 2.4 billion total global page views per month in 2013. And on and on. Snapchat has an estimated 8 million users, which represents only a narrow sliver of the electorate. That number, though, is much larger than the daily viewership of any TV morning show. Campaign strategists agree that television remains the most powerful forum for political messaging. Buying airtime during highly rated television programs is expensive for a reason. News broadcasts can still be potent vehicles, too. Witness how the marathon of televised Republican primary debates in 2011 and 2012 shaped public opinion about the race. But as the reach of television news dwindles, so does its political power. ""TV is still effective and still going to command the lion's share of campaign budgets,"" said Will Ritter, a Republican strategist who recently launched Poolhouse Digital, a Virginia-based ad firm devoted exclusively to producing online video for campaigns. ""But it's undeniable that every year millions of viewers are either cutting the cord or spending more time watching Netflix, Apple TV, YouTube, Vimeo or some platform we haven't even heard of yet. The trend is only going in one direction."" In 2012, the re-election campaign of President Obama had a firm grasp on the fracturing media ecosystem. It used sophisticated algorithms to identify potential voters and target them with paid media. But unlike past campaigns, it didn't bother relying on legacy media organizations or White House briefings to get the message out. It ran campaign ads on the TV Land network, or during ""Jeopardy"" reruns, or it designed creative ""infographics"" and pumped them directly into the Facebook bloodstream for supporters to share. ""We're just fishing where the fish are,"" said former Obama strategist David Axelrod in a study released last year by Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. Did Twitter Kill the Boys on the Bus? ""Our job as a campaign was to find out the viewing habits and the reading habits of the people who were going to be decisive in the campaign,"" Axelrod said. ""And as it turns out, a lot of those people were low-information voters who were absolutely not reading The New York Times and likely weren't reading a newspaper at all. They weren't watching the CBS or ABC or 'NBC Nightly News.' They weren't watching 'Morning Joe.' They were more likely to have been watching ESPN or reruns of 'Star Trek.' "" Enter the junior senator from Kentucky, who had a similar take on Snapchat, finding some common ground with Axelrod. ""If you want to get a message out, you have got to go where people are,"" Paul said. ""It's not necessarily choosing one medium over another. It's just knowing that there are hundreds of media outlets out there."" Paul also seemed to understand another important truth about campaigning in the Internet age: The message has to be tailored to the medium. In Snapchat's case, that means sharing content that's concise, witty or just plain wacky. ""The way that you communicate is just as important as what you say in it,"" said Ritter. ""You've got Vine and Instagram video and Tout and all these mediums. But it's not just about putting your bumper sticker everywhere. It's about proving to your more technologically savvy audience that you get it."" It's taken some time for politicians to figure this out. In 2006 and 2007, before Barack Obama became the golden boy of the Internet, it was actually John Edwards who pioneered the use of social media during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary fight. The Edwards campaign produced YouTube ""webisodes"" (filmed by someone named Rielle Hunter) and signed the campaign up for every social network imaginable (remember Ning?). But it felt perfunctory and inauthentic: The Edwards message was the same across all platforms. Even on LiveJournal. And for those looking for an even more cringe-worthy example, just Google ""Mark Warner"" and ""Second Life."" On Thursday, the libertarian-leaning Paul sent out his third ""Snap"" to his followers: a video of him flying a remote control drone around his Senate office, a winking reference to the overseas unmanned missile attacks he so despises. The previous day, he blasted out a black-and-white picture of the moon under the banner: ""Hey NSA check this out! You've been 'mooned.'"" ""People take things way too seriously,"" Paul said. ""The news cycle too often doesn't have any humor in it. I am always telling my staff to be on the lookout for humorous stuff."" The troubling downside to the explosion of news platforms, on mobile and elsewhere, is message control. Campaigns can keep their candidates cocooned far away from the mainstream media and deliver ""news"" on their own terms, without having to face very many difficult questions from obnoxious reporters. But in this era of fraying relationships between the press and politicians, Snapchat offered at least one glimmer of hope this week. This reporter, eager to chat with a presidential hopeful on Thursday, paused during a stroll on Constitution Avenue and sent Paul a Snapchat message requesting an interview. Thirty minutes later, he was on the line, raring to talk.","Politicians flocking to new platforms where younger voters are spending their time .

"President Barack Obama's historic move to loosen the U.S. embargo on Cuba set off an immediate clash with Republicans keen to use the dramatic foreign policy shift to further their own White House aspirations. The announcement immediately threw two Florida politicians -- Sen. Marco Rubio and former Governor Jeb Bush -- into the spotlight and served as another reminder of the state's enduring importance in presidential politics. Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, quickly took a hardline position, vowing to block any nominee the administration might put forward to be an ambassador to Cuba. He called Obama's announcement ""truly outrageous and counterproductive"" because there has been no ""democratic opening"" in Cuba. ""It is a lifeline for the Castro regime that will allow them to become more profitable ... and allow them to become a more permanent fixture,"" he said on CNN. ""The embargo is leverage, these sanctions are leverage."" Rubio continued: ""We have just lost a significant part of our leverage ... not a single democratic concession."" In a subsequent press conference, Rubio expanded his critique into a direct attack on Obama's foreign policy, previewing the assault Republican hawks could adopt in the presidential race. ""This president has proven today that his foreign policy is more than just naive,"" Rubio said. ""It is willfully ignorant of the way the world truly works."" Rubio called Obama ""the single worst negotiator we have had in the White House in my lifetime."" Bush, who shocked the political world on Tuesday by announcing he would explore a White House bid, welcomed the release of US contractor Alan Gross but said it was too early to transform Cuba policy. ""He shouldn't have been in prison to start with.  He didn't do anything to deserve it. But the fact that he's coming home is spectacular news for himself and his family — on the first day of Hanukkah,"" Bush said when asked about the Cuba news at a holiday event with Florida Governor Rick Scott. In his first major foreign policy comments of the nascent 2016 campaign, Bush then warned in a statement that only Fidel and Raul Castro, who between them have ruled Cuba for over half a century, would benefit from Obama's ""ill-advised move."" ""Cuba is a dictatorship with a disastrous human rights record, and now President Obama has rewarded those dictators. We should instead be fostering efforts that will truly lead to the fair, legitimate democracy that will ultimately prevail in Cuba,"" Bush said in a statement posted on his Facebook page. Bush's consistent hard line towards Havana could be appealing to thousands of Cuban Americans in Florida. But there's also the question of whether the issue will be as potent in 2016 as it has been in previous election cycles, as the younger generation of Cuban-Americans, many of them born in the U.S., are not as steeped in the Cold War-era struggle as their parents. Bush has been a strong supporter of the trade embargo and believes it should only be lifted once political prisoners are freed, Cuba fully embraces democracy and a market economy is established. ""Instead of lifting the embargo, we should consider strengthening it again to put pressure on the Cuba regime,"" Bush said at a meeting of the US-Cuba Democracy PAC earlier this month. Meanwhile, Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, whose father fled Cuba, expressed ""rejoice"" that Gross is back in the U.S. But he slammed Obama for easing restrictions on Cuba. ""Make no mistake, although we are glad Alan is now free, the agreement the Obama Administration has entered into with the Castro regime has done nothing to resolve the underlying problem,"" he said in a statement. ""Indeed, it has made it worse."" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is also considering a presidential run, tweeted ""this is an incredibly bad idea."" The GOP positions set up a clear contrast with a possible 2016 Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton, who expressed support for Obama's moves in a statement released Wednesday night. ""I support President Obama's decision to change course on Cuba policy, while keeping the focus on our principal objective -- supporting the aspirations of the Cuban people for freedom,"" she said. ""It is great news that Alan is finally home with his family, where he belongs."" The former secretary of state ran for the White House in 2008 opposing calls to lift the embargo, but she has since shifted her stance. In an interview with Fusion television network earlier this year, Clinton argued that the embargo had ""propped up"" the Castro regime. ""I would like to see us move toward normalizing relations eventually and therefore more Americans (allowed to move) back and forth,"" she said. ""That's something President Obama did and I supported in the first term."" Clinton wrote in her book ""Hard Choices"" that towards the end of her time in the Obama administration, she ""recommended to President Obama that he take another look at our embargo."" ""It wasn't achieving its goals and it was holding back our broader agenda across Latin America,"" she wrote . Meanwhile, Obama's announcement surprised many on Capitol Hill. Outgoing Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Robert Menendez, who has often crossed swords with Obama on Iran and Cuba policy, issued a statement that hinted at the tough fight to come over the embargo in Congress. WATCH: Castro thanks Obama, pope . While hailing a ""moment of profound relief"" for Gross, Menendez blasted Obama, who he said had ""vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government."" ""Trading Mr Gross for three convicted criminals sets and extremely dangerous precedent,"" said Menendez. ""It invites dictatorial and rogue regimes to use Americans serving overseas as bargaining chips,"" he said and argued that the""asymmetrical trade"" will invite further belligerence from the government towards the Cuban opposition. House Speaker John Boehner also hammered Obama's foreign policy, rebuking the President for ""another in a long line of mindless concessions to a dictatorship that brutalizes its people and schemes with our enemies."" Tennessee GOP Sen. Bob Corker, who will take control of the foreign relations panel next year, said lawmakers ""will be closely examining the implications of these major policy changes in the next Congress.""","Obama move opens 2016 row over Cuba .

"It is no secret that the Congressional Black Caucus did not initially support Barack Obama's campaign to become president of the United States.  During the 2008 primary campaign, half of the members backed then-Sen. Hillary Clinton. It was not until the Iowa caucus win by Obama that many black Americans started to believe it was possible for a black man to become president. And even once it was clear that Obama could win, some CBC members were still skeptical. Fast forward to this year. The black caucus and most of black America (with the exception of Tavis Smiley and Cornel West) had remained silent for two years about the devastating economic impact of the recession on black people. They did so out of fear that to criticize this president would hurt his standing as the nation's first black commander in chief.  But finally this summer, the CBC, led by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, took off the gloves and broke its silence through a series of national town hall forums. Waters said she was concerned that the president's jobs tour ""did not include any black cities."" She further indicated that the black caucus wanted to put pressure on Obama, but could not, due to the fact that black people ""love the president.""  She said the caucus also ""loves the president,"" but lamented, ""We are getting tired."" Waters ended by asking the audience, ""Will you unleash us? Let us know when to let go, and we will let go."" At the White House, there was dismay about how to respond to this attack from its most loyal base of supporters. Finally, the White House started a blitz of interviews on black media. Although the president and his staff steered away from using the word ""black,"" they made clear that they heard the CBC's message and were working diligently to change course. All seemed well, that is until Saturday night at the 41st annual CBC Phoenix Awards dinner in Washington, where the president told the attendees, ""I expect all of you to march with me and press on.  Take off your bedroom slippers, put on your marching shoes.  Shake it off.  Stop complaining, stop grumbling, stop crying.  We are going to press on.  We've got work to do, CBC."" Taking the president's comments in context, it is clear that he directed his ire at his critics. Some say he was offering a ""tough love"" rebuke, rallying the troops to get up and act. But the reality is that black America is in a crisis that civil rights icon Marian Wright Edelman last week called ""the worst since slavery."" The president made clear his dismay with such criticisms during a Monday night BET interview when asked by a reporter why he doesn't ""target black  America specifically for economic relief."" Obama  responded, ""America doesn't work that way."" Others have questioned the president's choice of words at the CBC dinner and asked, ""Who is complaining?"" Their take is that they are standing up for those who cannot stand up for themselves and that they are pushing a black agenda as others have pushed their own agendas. The president would never speak in such a manner to the Hispanic Caucus, which has pushed him very aggressively on immigration reform and now has a Latina justice on the nation's high court. Nor would he address our gay brethren in such a manner as they pushed hard for a repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" and now want the Defense of Marriage Act reversed. How about our Jewish brothers and sisters? Would he tell them to stand down on their views of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, or stop lobbying hard for pro-Israel policies? Never. For reasons beyond my understanding, the audience at the CBC that heard this rebuke cheered the president. But those of us who are journalists would be wrong not to question why black America is so willing to tolerate such openly unbalanced treatment when other groups would never accept it.  So the deeper question is not why President Obama took the tone he did, but why black America tolerates it. Obama seemed to be asking black America once again to keep the faith -- to ""press on"" and to ""shake it off.""  OK  -- but how do you shake off poverty? How do you keep the faith when you are unemployed and cannot feed your kids? How do you press on when you have no health care, no home, and no hope? I too like this president. I voted for him in 2008, and his candidacy led me to leave the Republican Party to become an independent.   But I think the time has come for the administration to ""take its slippers off"" and march into America's urban centers and rural centers, and create a sustainable and real-time jobs policy -- going beyond the president's jobs bill -- that will touch everyday black Americans who are out of work and economically disenfranchised.   That is not too much to ask, and it is not showing favoritism to one group over others. The cold hard fact is that no group is being as negatively impacted by this recession as blacks, so it is proper and necessary for the CBC and others to continue to press this president to do more.","Sophia Nelson: President Obama's remarks to black caucus caused controversy .

"(CNN) -- Remember the dire predictions surrounding the ""millennium bug?"" The doom-and-gloom scenarios bandied about by security analysts on how computers could act when their clocks turned to January 1, 2000? Computer users will not know that Conficker.c has infected their machine. Well, researchers are hoping that a potential April Fools' time bomb -- the Conficker.c that is supposed to hit computers on April 1 -- turns out to be equally unfounded. But realizing that hope alone is not a prudent option, here is a primer on the worm so you can adequately prepare yourself -- and your computer. What is Conficker.c and what do analysts fear it may do? Conficker.c is a worm, a malicious program thought to have already infected between 5 million and 10 million computers. Those infections haven't spawned many symptoms, but on April 1 a master computer is scheduled to gain control of these zombie machines, said Don DeBolt, director of threat research for CA, a New York-based IT and software company. What happens on April Fool's Day is anyone's guess. The program could delete all of the files on a person's computer, use zombie PCs -- those controlled by a master -- to overwhelm and shut down Web sites or monitor a person's keyboard strokes to collect private information like passwords or bank account information, experts said. More likely, though, said DeBolt, the virus may try to get computer users to buy fake software or spend money on other phony products. Experts said computer hackers largely have moved away from showboating and causing random trouble. They now usually try to make money off their viral programs.  Watch more on the worm » . How does the Conficker.c work? Conficker.c imbeds itself deep in the computer where it is difficult to track. The program, for instance, stops Windows from conducting automatic updates that could prevent it from causing damage. The program's code is also written to evolve over time and its author appears to be making updates to thwart attempts to neuter the worm. Who wrote the program? It's unclear who wrote the program, but anti-work researchers -- a group calling itself the Conficker Cabal -- are looking for clues. First, they know that some recent programs have come from Eastern European countries outside the jurisdiction of the European Union, said Patrick Morganelli, senior vice president of technology for Enigma Software. Worm program authors often hide in those countries to stay out of sight from law enforcement, he said. In a way, the Conficker Cabal is also looking for the program author's fingerprints. DeBolt said security researchers are looking through old programs to see if their programming styles are similar to that of Conficker C. The prospects for catching the program's author are not good, Morganelli said. ""Unless they open their mouth, they'll never be found,"" he said. So, the most effective counter-assault simply may be damage control. How can I tell if my computer's infected? One quick way to see if your computer has been infected is to see if you have gotten automatic updates from Windows in March. If so, your computer likely is fine, DeBolt said. Microsoft released a statement saying the company ""is actively working with the industry to mitigate the spread of the worm."" Users who haven't gotten the latest Windows updates should go to http://safety.live.com if they fear they're infected, the company's statement says. People who use other antivirus software should check to make sure they've received the latest updates, which also could have been disabled by Conficker.c. How did the worm evolve? The first version of Conficker -- strain A -- was released in late 2008. That version used 250 Web addresses -- generated daily by the system -- as the means of communication between the master computer and its zombies. The end goal of the first line was to sell computer users fake antivirus software, said Morganelli. Computer security experts largely patched that problem by working with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers to disable or buy the problematic URLs, he said. A second variant, Conficker.b, was released in January and infected millions more machines. The Conficker, strain C, will generate 50,000 URLs per day instead of just 250 when it becomes active, DeBolt said. What is being done to fight Conficker? Members are searching for the malicious software program's author and for ways to do damage control if he or she can't be stopped. They're motivated in part by a $250,000 bounty from Microsoft.","Computer experts worried about April Fools' worm -- the Conficker.c .

"The Oscars. Perhaps the most sought-after red carpet invitation in the world. And Angela Ahrendts turned it down. It says a lot about the 53-year-old chief executive of Burberry, who today announced she would be leaving the British clothing firm to join technology giant Apple as its new vice president for retail and online stores. This is a woman who prioritizes family above all -- and that includes rubbing shoulders with the crème de la crème of Hollywood at lavish gala events. The same mother-of-three who married her childhood sweetheart Gregg, and reportedly tries to limit herself to one night out a week. And the same woman who this year became the first female to top Britain's executive pay league, taking home a total £16.9 million ($27 million). Unsurprisingly, ""balance"" is a big word in Ahrendts' life. She turned down an invite to the Academy Awards because: ""It's not more important than my husband. It's not more important than my kids. It's not more important than Burberry,"" she said in an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Times. ""I don't want to be a great executive without being a great mom and a great wife. I don't want to look back and say I wish I had done things differently."" Fashion forward . Growing up as one of six siblings in the small town of New Palestine in Indiana, Ahrendts gained a merchandise and marketing degree from Ball State University before rising up the ranks of fashion houses Donna Karan International, Henri Bendal, and Liz Claiborne. In 2006 she headed to Britain, joining Burberry as its CEO, and revitalizing the century-old company which had seen its iconic check pattern become the favored print of minor celebrities and rip-off merchants. Indeed,  Ahrendts has been credited with rescuing the Burberry brand from the clutches of the masses and placing it on the top shelf of luxury living. Thanks to Ahrendts, Burberry is now not only cool but synonymous with glamor. Revenues have nearly tripled to more than $3 billion and Ahrendt herself was catapulted to 53 on the Forbes 100 Most Powerful Women list this year. Watch: Angela Ahrendts -- 'profits are up' ""Burberry is in brilliant shape,"" said Ahrendt in a statement today. ""Having built the industry's most powerful management team, converted the business to a dynamic digital global retailer, created a world class supply chain, state of the art technology infrastructure, sensational brand momentum and one of the most closely connected creative cultures in the world today."" She will be replaced by chief creative officer Christopher Bailey, who has been in the role for six years, and her departure means there are now just two female chief executives in the FTSE 100 -- Imperial Tobacco chief Alison Cooper and EasyJet's Carolyn McCall. Facebook generation . What's the secret to Ahrendts' enormous success? A seemingly indefatigable work ethic appears to be one. This, after all, is the woman who reportedly rises at 4.35am and has a reliance on Diet Coke. But there's also been her ability to tap into a new generation of digital consumers relying on social media for fashion trends, and increasingly buying online. Burberry's Spring/Summer 2013 campaign video gained over one million YouTube views in just 48 hours. And the luxury brand now has 16 million fans on Facebook and more than two million followers on Twitter. Wander around Burberry's London flagship store on Regent Street and you'll find sales assistants armed with iPads. Meanwhile mirrors transform into screens displaying catwalk images thanks to special technology sewn into some clothing and accessories. What's more is that the actual store has been redesigned to recreate an experience that reflects the company's website, Burberry World Live. ""Burberry is a company that's been around 155 years. Nothing's short term. Everything is for the long term,"" she told CNN of her marketing plan in 2011. After her seven years at Burberry, what Ahrendts will be most remembered for is her digital first approach that helped revitalize the century old fashion house into an upmarket luxury brand. iWatch this space? Ahrendts' fashion credentials helped her breathe new life into a British clothing institution. But with rumors that Apple is now keen to use her expertise on its new iWatch, could they also boost a sector increasingly delving into wearable technology? After all, Apple's decision to hire Ahrendts comes just three months after it recruited Paul Deneve, the former chief executive of French luxury group Yves Saint Laurent. And if anybody's up to the job of keeping up with cool kids of fashion, it's Ahrendts.","Who is Angela Ahrendts, new Apple vice president of retail and online?

"Japan has finally made the possession of child pornography a punishable offense. The country's upper house of parliament passed a bill Wednesday, which will see people found with explicit images of children jailed for up to year or fined up to $10,000. The bill was a long time coming for activists who argued that Japan's relatively lax laws put children at risk by banning the production and distribution of child pornography, but not people found with it in their possession. ""It's been 10 years and it's finally changed. I'm so pleased that Japan finally moved one step toward the international standard,"" said Shihoko Fujiwara, from Lighthouse, a nonprofit group that helps exploited children. ""Under the existing circumstances, the suffering and damage has become more critical. I really hope that the law rescues suffering child victims, as well as the victims damaged in the past by stopping the circulation of child porn. This is the epoch-making event for Japan,"" she said. Notable exclusions . The bill notably excludes the possession of explicit anime or manga, a point of contention for campaigners who say that cartoons depicting child sexual abuse should also be banned. Representatives of those industries say that while they support the ban on real child pornography, any move to censor their products would be an unjustified restriction of freedom of expression. Daisuke Okeda, a lawyer and inspector for the Japan Animation Creators Association, said it was ""natural that animation is exempted."" ""The goal of the law itself is to protect children from crime,"" he said. ""Banning such expression in animation under this law would not satisfy the goal of the law."" Hiroshi Chiba, the manager of Chiba Tetsuya Production, one of the country's best known manga production houses, said that more could be done in terms of age restrictions on graphic content featuring children and to distinguish it more clearly from other comics. And he admitted that some products of the industry leave him and his colleagues ""disgusted."" ""But rich, deep culture is born from something that might not be accepted by all,"" Chiba said. ""We need to allow the gray zone to exist as a necessary evil."" Child abuse in Japan . Statistics show that child pornography remains a big problem in Japan. The U.S. State Department's 2013 report on human rights practices in Japan labels the country ""an international hub for the production and trafficking of child pornography."" It cited Japanese police data showing the number of child pornography investigations in 2012 rose 9.7% from a year earlier to a record of 1,596. The cases involved 1,264 child victims, almost twice as many as in the previous year. Under the new law, people in possession of child pornography have one year to dispose of it before they risk prosecution.

"Michael Schumacher's serious skiing accident in the French Alps has once again put the spotlight on skiing safety. The seven-time Formula One world champion remains in a critical condition after hitting his head on a rock at the Meribel resort in France on Sunday. But according to Dr. Mike Langran, a Scottish doctor who specializes in ski safety, serious accidents like the one endured by the German are uncommon. ""Accidents of this nature are, thankfully, rare events amongst skiers and snowboarders, although of course they usually receive substantial media attention,"" Langran said in a statement on Monday. Langran, who was interviewed by CNN about skiing safety last January, said he was ""deeply saddened and concerned"" on hearing of Schumacher's accident and wished him a ""speedy and complete recovery,"" but stressed that the risk of injury from snow sports remains low. ""As with any recreational activity however, it is impossible to completely remove all elements of risk when participating in snow sports,"" Langran said. ""The absolute risk of an injury whilst skiing or snowboarding recreationally remains very low, in the order of 2-4 injuries per 1,000 days spent on the slopes. ""The vast majority of people will ski or board all their lives without ever sustaining a significant injury."" Commenting in January on skiing injuries and fatalities, Langran insisted that winter sports have had a bad press when it comes to perceptions about safety. Read more: World waits on Schumacher's fate . ""For snow sports, the average injury rate is 2-3 per 1000 participants on any one day. Compare that to an average game of soccer or rugby where perhaps the same number, or more are injured out of a much smaller number of players,"" he told CNN. Langran added that in the U.S. over the past 10 years, on average, about 41.5 people had died per year from skiing or snowboarding. ""The rate of fatality converts to 0.78 per million skier/snowboarder visits. Although it's not directly comparable, in the United States in 2009, 2,400 people drowned while swimming in public areas and 800 died while bicycle riding,"" Langran said. Schumacher is being treated for his injuries at the University Hospital Center of Grenoble. At a news conference on Monday, doctors said it was too early to say what the former F1 driver's prognosis might be. Schumacher was in a coma when he arrived at the hospital and required immediate brain surgery, officials said. He has undergone one operation and is being kept in an induced coma, officials added. The 44-year-old was reportedly wearing a helmet when he fell. Doctors at the Grenoble hospital said that without the helmet's protection, Schumacher wouldn't have made it to the operating table. ""I always recommend skiers and snowboarders to wear an appropriate helmet,"" said Langran. ""Whilst they can never provide complete protection in all accident situations, I have no doubt that his use of a helmet will have substantially attenuated the injuries sustained."" The FIS (the International Ski Federation) has recommended the use of helmets on the slopes since 2006, but their use remains voluntary. Some travel insurance companies, however, now insist they are worn otherwise claims by injured skiers could be invalidated. Read more: Danger on the slopes: Are winter sports safe?

"An African-American college student is suing Barneys New York and the city's police department, saying he was racially profiled and later detained by police, according to court documents filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. New York City College of Technology student Trayon Christian, who was 18 at the time, entered Barneys New York on Madison Avenue on April 29 to buy a Ferragamo belt he had seen rappers wear on television, Christian's attorney, Michael Palillo, told CNN on Wednesday. When Christian went to pay for the belt with his debit card at a register, a Barneys cashier asked for identification. Christian showed the cashier his driver's license, paid for the belt with his card, signed the receipt and left the luxury department store with the belt in a Barneys bag. He walked a block before two undercover police officers stopped him, Palillo said. Hollywood couple stopped by police, say they were racially profiled . The officers asked Christian for his identification and asked what was in the Barneys bag. When they saw the designer belt, they asked him how he was able to afford it, Palillo said. The officers allegedly accused him of purchasing the belt with a fraudulent card and said they had received a call from Barneys, according to Palillo. In a prepared statement, a Barneys representative said that Barneys New York ""typically does not comment on pending litigation."" The representative said that in this instance, the company felt compelled to say ""that after carefully reviewing the incident of last April, it is clear that no employee of Barneys New York was involved in the pursuit of any action with the individual other than the sale.

When they confirmed that his card was valid, police released Christian and apologized, Palillo said. ""But it wasn't a sincere 'sorry,' more of a matter-of-fact 'sorry,' "" he added. The New York Police Department did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Palillo said this is a clear case of racial profiling by the department store and police. ""This is an outrage. He committed no crime,"" he said. ""He's a young black male who likes fashion."" Palillo recently received a call from another man who said he experienced a similar incident at Barneys -- an injustice that appears to happen too often, Palillo said.

"While secretary of state, Hillary Clinton was skeptical of early plans to trade Taliban prisoners for American captive Bowe Bergdahl, former officials involved in the process told CNN on Tuesday. Clinton pushed for a much tougher deal than the one with Qatar that secured the Army sergeant's release in exchange for five terror detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, they said. She left office in 2013, but the former officials said they didn't know whether Clinton would have signed off on the swap that culminated this past weekend with Bergdahl climbing aboard a military helicopter. Clinton offered a measured defense of it in an appearance in Denver on Monday. But she but did not answer when asked directly if she would have approved, if still serving as America's top diplomat. ""This young man, whatever the circumstances, was an American citizen -- is an American citizen -- was serving in our military,"" Clinton said. ""The idea that you really care for your own citizens and particularly those in uniform, I think is a very noble one."" Bergdahl was the only remaining U.S. soldier captured during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinton's thinking on the matter is in play as she considers whether to run for president in 2016. Republicans have taken aim at President Barack Obama's foreign policy, and some conservatives complain that negotiating with the Taliban illustrates weak leadership that could hurt America later on. Obama has defended his decision, saying, ""We don't leave men and women in uniform behind."" Bergdahl, 28, was captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan in June 2009, and was apparently moved between that country and Pakistan at that time. Clinton did not trust the Haqqani network believed to have held him, the former officials said, and she was skeptical that the trade would lead to peace with the Taliban. She reportedly was also concerned about the ability to enforce any deal. The Haqqani network has ties to al Qaeda and the Taliban, and the United States has designated it a foreign-based terror organization. Republicans and Democrats in Congress had also raised serious concerns more than two years ago with the Obama administration about the possibility of such a swap, and inquired about conditions. Key members from both parties wrote Clinton about their concern, and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein said they received a ""comprehensive response"" that included ""security assurances and a promise of consultation with the Congress."" Feinstein and House Speaker John Boehner said this week they could recall no further consultations about the matter with the administration until last Saturday. A framework for negotiations approved by Clinton, however, had tougher measures aiming to ensure the detainees would not return to the battlefield, including releasing the prisoners in two phases. The former officials said that under her plan, the first three would be released and then the remaining two would be freed 60 days later when they released Bergdahl. She also wanted the Qataris to impose stricter restrictions and monitoring once they were in that nation's custody, the officials said. Under the agreement reached with the Obama administration, the five detainees were transferred to Qatar where they can live freely but will be monitored for a year. American troops are due to wrap up combat operations in Afghanistan at year's end with most forces leaving the country. While the deal resulting in Bergdahl's release resulted from indirect talks mediated by Qatar, administration officials led by Marc Grossman, Clinton's special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, met several  times with Taliban leaders in 2011 and 2012 to discuss the issue. The meetings occurred before the Taliban broke off talks. Clinton wanted the prisoner swap to be one of a series confidence-building measures, which also included the opening of a Taliban office in Qatar's capital, Doha, and a Taliban renunciation of terrorism, as part of larger peace efforts between the Taliban and Afghanistan. She also pushed Pakistan to use its influence with the Taliban to engage in the reconciliation talks to end the war, as the United States prepared to wind down in Afghanistan. ""You don't make peace with your friends,"" she told Congress in October 2011. ""There first would have to be a demonstrated willingness on the Taliban's part to negotiate and to meet the conditions already laid out for joining negotiations."" The Taliban office opened in June 2013, but closed the same day when the group violated the terms by raising their flag, effectively killing talks for six months. Ultimately, the Obama administration agreed to release all of the prisoners at once and, because the Taliban said it would only negotiate over the prisoner exchange, abandoned its efforts at wider reconciliation when the talks resumed earlier this year. Who was swapped for Bergdahl? Clinton on Monday said the ultimate outcome of the exchange is unknown right now. ""I think we have a long way to go before we really know how this is going to play out,"" Clinton said. ""You don't want to see these five prisoners go back to combat. There's a lot that you don't want to have happen."" But she added, ""You also don't want an American citizen, if you can avoid it, especially a solider, to die in captivity.""","Former officials: Hillary Clinton was skeptical of prisoner trade plans .

"KHARTOUM, Sudan (CNN) -- A British teacher arrested in Sudan after allowing her class to name a teddy bear ""Mohammed"" has been charged by authorities with offending religion, British officials say. An undated amateur photo of Gillian Gibbons. Gillian Gibbons, 54, is being held by police in the capital Khartoum after she asked her class of seven-year-olds to come up with a name for the toy as part of a school project, Robert Boulos, the head of Unity High School told CNN. It is expected that she will appear in court Thursday, Sudan state media reported. A British Foreign Office spokeswoman said Gibbons had been charged under Article 125 of Sudan's constitution, the law relating to insulting religion and inciting hatred. The spokeswoman said the Sudanese ambassador had been summoned to the offices of the British Foreign Secretary David Miliband to discuss the case. Gibbons was arrested under the country's Islamic Sharia law after parents of some of her students complained to police.  Hear about the charges against Gibbons » . Under country's law, the offense is punishable with 40 lashes, a jail term of up to a year or a fine. Khalid Mubarak, the media counselor at the Sudan embassy in London, said the judicial process was taking its course but added that even if Gibbons was found guilty ""the question of punishment is a long way off."" ""This woman is being dealt with in the proper ways in accordance with the laws of our country,"" he told CNN. He said he was concerned about how the latest developments would affect Sudan's relationship with Britain. ""This is a worry for us. We have already received abusive phone calls to our offices in London,"" he said. Gibbons' arrest was announced in Arabic on the state-run news agency's Web site. No-one from Sudan's government has so far commented on the decision. It is not known how long the court process will take or the type of court the hearing will take place in. Although there is no ban in the Koran on images of Allah or the Prophet Mohammed, likenesses are considered highly offensive by Muslims. Gibbons had been working at the school -- popular with wealthy Sudanese and expatriates -- since August, after leaving her position as deputy head teacher at a primary school in Liverpool this summer, said Boulos. He said Gibbons had asked the children to pick their favorite name for the new class mascot, which she was using to aid lessons about animals and their habitats. Classmates took turns taking the teddy bear home with them, accompanied by a diary with the bear's name written in the front of it, said Boulos, who heads the private school, which has been shut down since the controversy came to light. ""All this is a very sensitive area. I asked her (Gibbons) why she had done it and she said she didn't chose the name, the children did,"" he told CNN. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Tuesday he was ""very sorry"" about Gibbons' arrest and that the British Embassy in Khartoum was ""giving all appropriate consular assistance to her."" Brown said all efforts were being taken to ensure her early release and that government officials were in touch with the teacher's family in the northern British city of Liverpool.

"(CNN) -- It's getting difficult, even for a defense attorney, to keep track of the allegations against Bill Cosby. Recently, the embattled comedian's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the actor-comedian of sexually assaulting plaintiff Judith Huth in 1974 at the Playboy Mansion when she was 15. Huth claims she and a 16-year-old friend met Cosby at a Los Angeles-area film shoot. A week later Cosby allegedly plied them with drinks at a tennis club, after which the lawsuit states that Cosby took her to the Playboy Mansion. At the mansion, Cosby allegedly forced her to perform a sex act on him. Cosby and his attorneys are not going quietly into the good night. They have filed a ""demurrer"", which challenges the legal sufficiency of the claims or the complaint itself. A demurrer essentially says the complaint is so defective as written, that it should be dismissed His attorneys have also gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit. In the court of public opinion, many have already concluded that there is something to these mounting accusations. On the other hand, perhaps the jury of public sentiment will be swayed by Camille Cosby's retort today that media coverage of her husband is comparable to the Rolling Stone UVA alleged gang rape article. Verdicts in the court of public opinion are mercurial and rarely restrained by the same strictures applied by the actual judiciary. In real court, however, the rules are different. Huth's attorneys should have complied with these rules. If they knew it was impossible to comply with the rules, then the attorneys knew when they filed the complaint that it was fatally defective. Irrespective of the breakdown in communication between lawyer and client, this complaint should probably be dismissed. Cosby breaks his silence . Huth filed her complaint long after the time permitted by the statute of limitations. Statutes of limitations are laws that set the maximum period during which one can wait before filing a lawsuit, and they vary depending on the state and type of case. By definition, they deny access to a substantive claim for a purely procedural reason. While limitations periods are arbitrary, the public policy is not: defendants deserve protection of the law too. It makes sense that you should not have to be hauled into court tomorrow for a fender bender you got into with your 1977 AMC Gremlin...in 1977. But there's a big difference between a minor traffic accident and sexual assault cases. Limitations periods are more controversial in sexual assault cases because complainants -- sometimes children -- will repress memories, or fear coming forward. Indeed, the abject terror or trauma caused by an assailant may be why the victim lets the limitations period run. Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules extending the time to file in cases of childhood sexual abuse. Under California law, the only way that an alleged victim of childhood sexual abuse is able to bring an otherwise time-barred claim is to allege that the psychological injury was repressed and was only discovered within the last three years. Since this constitutes a potentially limitless limitations period, the rule has two major safeguards built into it to avoid meritless claims and protect the rights of would-be defendants. First, when asserting claims based on alleged ""childhood sexual abuse,"" a plaintiff over the age of 26 has to file Certificates of Merit, documents executed by a licensed mental health practitioner attesting that the allegations have merit. Cosby's attorneys correctly point out that Huth failed to file the requisite certificates, which exposes the complaint itself to attack. The public policy behind this rule is sound: taking a plaintiff's word that they repressed a memory that caused them to miss the statute of limitations invites uncertainty and fraud. Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit. However, Cosby's lawyers point out she attempted to sell this story to the tabloids more than nine years ago. Even if Huth is allowed to file these certificates, what medical professional will certify her lost memory until three years ago of an event ... that she tried to profit from by selling word of it some years before that? Second, the rule provides some protection to would-be defendants and their privacy. After all, requiring some initial scientific proof of a repressed memory and injury is a good idea, but a medical provider cannot really provide any assurances about the identity of an assailant -- other than relying upon the patient's words. That's why a plaintiff is prohibited under the rules from identifying the defendant by name until the court gives permission. Huth could have complied with this rule by naming Cosby as ""John Doe,"" or some anonymous designation. She didn't. Her attorneys filed her Complaint naming Cosby. You might think this is just a clerical gaffe that could be remedied, as many are, by filing an amended complaint (as she eventually did). Cosby's attorneys point out that this is no mere mistake that can be fixed. Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission. Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there. As Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, and many at Sony have learned, you can't un-ring the privacy bell -- once your name (or image) is out there, it's out there. Childhood sexual abuse is a detestable crime, and the injuries last a lifetime. Recognizing this, modern jurisdictions have amended the normally inflexible statutes of limitations to allow victims their day in court, while seeking to protect would-be defendants from meritless claims. Huth's case illustrates that these rules are not merely procedural. Violating these protective rules threatens the public perception of other legitimate victims who want their day in court. The court of public opinion will likely ignore these violations as technicalities, and continue to judge, and condemn Cosby. That's how that ""court"" operates -- unfettered by the nuisances of the rules of procedure or evidence. But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.","Bill Cosby was target of an abuse claim going back 40 years .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Allegations that five U.S. contractors detained inside Baghdad's Green Zone were somehow involved in the death of another American contractor last month are ""completely false,"" a son of one of the detainees told CNN Sunday. In a CNN exclusive, video shows U.S. contractors taken into custody by Iraqi authorities. Four of the five detained contractors work for North Carolina-based Corporate Training Unlimited -- a security firm headed by Donald Feeney, who, along with his son, Donald Feeney III, has been detained, according to another son, John Feeney. A fifth contractor works in Baghdad for another company. ""We're pretty sure they will be questioned there in the next couple of days and released with no charges,"" John Feeney said, adding the men appeared in court Sunday and were scheduled for another hearing Monday. CTU was founded by the elder Feeney, a former member of the elite anti-terrorist unit, the Delta Force, sources with knowledge of the case told CNN Sunday. The company in Fayetteville, North Carolina, has been operating in Iraq since 2003, according to its Web site. Iraqi and U.S. personnel took the five into custody early Friday in connection with the killing of contractor James Kitterman, according to an Iraqi official involved in the investigation and another source with knowledge of the case. Three of them allegedly had direct involvement in the death, according to an Iraqi security source. None of the men have been charged. Kitterman was found bound, blindfolded and fatally stabbed in a car in the district, formally known as the International Zone, on May 22. The 60-year-old Houston, Texas, resident owned a construction company that operated in Iraq. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad confirmed that Iraqi authorities took five U.S. citizens into custody. The embassy said the men were not detained on suspicion of murder, but for an unrelated matter. The five were being held by Iraqi security forces Sunday at a jail inside the heavily protected Green Zone, the Iraqi official said. They have been in custody for three days. ""They have lawyers there on the ground with them,"" John Feeney told CNN. ""They have been there with them the whole time. We have people there who work for us who are bringing them food, clothes -- whatever they need. They're being treated well, and the State Department and the FBI are also involved."" The troops also confiscated weapons during the pre-dawn raid on the suspects' firm, said the Iraqi official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The four CTU detainees were identified by multiple sources as: Donald Feeney and Donald Feeney III; Micah Milligan; and Mark Bridges. John Feeney identified the fifth detainee as Jason Jones, who works for another company. A source close to the suspects, who asked not to be identified, said each of the five men insisted they have alibis that would clear them and that they are anxious to tell their stories to a judge. John Feeney said his father was ""not even in the country"" at the time of Kitterman's killing. He was heading back from the Philippines to make arrangements after the death of another CTU employee at the time. The U.S. Embassy would not confirm the names of the detainees, citing privacy laws. But a spokesman said consular officials have visited with them and ""they appeared well."" Embassy officials have been visiting them frequently, the Iraqi security source said. The U.S. State Department and the Iraqi government will negotiate to determine what happens next, according to the Iraqi security source close to the investigation who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case. Iraqi jail workers are treating the five contractors very well and with respect, he said. The Feeneys had known Kitterman for six years from their time in the Green Zone and ""respected him,"" CTU spokeswoman Sarah Smith told CNN. ""Just being in the Green Zone for six years, they became very close,"" she said, adding, ""Everyone is deeply upset about the loss of Jim Kitterman and our deepest sympathy goes to his family."" If the suspects are charged and referred to trial, the case would be sent to Iraq's Central Criminal Court, the Iraqi official said. If that happens, it would mark the first time U.S. citizens go to trial in that country since the United States returned the nation's government to the Iraqis.

"The number of confirmed dead keeps rising in a Mumbai, India, building-collapse -- a  tragedy that may have never happened if the warnings had been heeded months ago. A council had warned that the five-story building was rickety. It was visibly dilapidated and worn. Vacate it, they advised in a notice in April. But when it pancaked down into rubble and dust on Friday, over 100 people may have still been inside. Fifty people are confirmed dead and 33 are so far known to have survived the collapse, officials said. Officials had previously said 60 people were injured in the collapse. Another dozen or more people may still be buried -- either dead or alive -- under the mounds of brick and concrete and the rescue operation continues, officials said. Now sniffer dogs and rescuers offer the only way out. They were able to pull an 11-year-old girl from the debris, when she cried out to them that she was alive. Rescue personnel ""are closely monitoring any noises or movement from under the debris that can lead us to people trapped inside,"" said Sachidanand Gawde, deputy commandant at the National Disaster Response Force. But they haven't heard a sound from beneath their feet since midday Saturday. The rescuers are digging with their hands, as heavy machinery stands aside out of fear it could crush pockets in the rubble where survivors may be clinging to life. The residents of the collapsed building may have stayed, because they had no place else to go. They likely did not want to let go of the roof over their heads in a city where demand for housing far exceeds supply. Living space is expensive in Mumbai, India's financial hub. Many residents of the makeshift building were poor, unskilled workers for the Bombay Municipal Corporation, which ironically, had issued a notice that the building had gone bad. Repairs followed the warnings, and there were plans for future repairs, a spokesman for Brihanmumbai Municipal Council, which owns the building, said. The rubble and lost lives have put an end to those plans. Several buildings in the Mumbai area have crumbled this year, one of them with disastrous consequences. In April, scores of people were killed in the collapse of a multistory building in Thane, a city in the Mumbai region. Deadly collapses have occurred in the city in past years, as well. Housing rights groups say many old buildings in the city are rundown and neglected, while newer ones are often built illegally, using substandard materials and have structural defects.","A council urged residents to vacate the building months ago .

"New York (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William and Kate left flowers at one of the reflecting pools during their visit to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum Tuesday morning, both pausing to reflect as somber skies and pouring rain marked the occasion. A handwritten note placed with the flowers read: ""In sorrowful memory of those who died on 11th September and in admiration of the courage shown to rebuild. William and Catherine."" Their visit to the memorial was the first stop on the royal couple's jam-packed third and final day in New York City. The Duke and Duchess spent roughly 30 minutes inside the museum, remarking on the ""survivors' staircase"" that was salvaged from the tower ruins. ""They had lots of questions and interest in how these stairs were used by hundreds of people on that day to escape,"" said Joe Daniels, the museum's president. Both also visited the ""In Memoriam"" exhibition, which holds profiles of 9/11 victims, and a wall that bears 2,983 blue tiles -- one for each of the victims of the attacks in New York, the Pentagon and the Pennsylvania site where a hijacked plane crashed, plus the victims of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Before leaving the museum, Kate and William both signed an interactive electronic tablet, writing ""Catherine"" and ""William"" in script, which projected their signatures on a 60-foot wall in the museum's Foundation Hall. ""It was a tremendous visit, and you could see in, really, both of their eyes, the sort of care and curiosity they had for the story of what happened and the people who died that day,"" said Daniels. The museum was open to the public during their visit, though other museumgoers were kept at a distance. Echoing the excited crowds that greeted the pair at their arrival at the Carlyle Hotel Sunday evening, a dozen or so visitors awaited the couple's arrival in the museum lobby, ready with their camera phones. Mary Failes of Virginia Beach, Virginia, was one of them. A longtime ""royal watcher"" who held a ""baby shower"" for Kate and hosted a viewing of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana's 1981 wedding at her home, had long planned to visit the 9/11 museum and just happened to be there the same day as William and Kate. ""It was just a coincidence -- meant to be!"" Failes said. Performance worthy of London's West End . The pair later then made their way to an event hosted by The Door and the CityKids Foundation, both arts-education and youth-development centers for disadvantaged youths in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan. The two were treated to a dance, storytelling, and musical performance by people involved with both centers. William was seen tapping his feet to music that accompanied a hip-hop dance show. One performance by Steven Prescod, which told the story of how his father was incarcerated and how he faced his own possible jail term, impressed William so much that he offered to help bring the story to a mainstream audience. ""William said he wanted to help me put this together. He gave me his contact number and said to reach out to him,"" said Prescod, 22, of Brooklyn. He said the Duke and Duchess' visit ""brought hope."" After the show, William he congratulated the group. ""That was incredible, guys. It was amazing and should be on in the West End,"" referring to an area in London where several professional theaters are located. ""It nearly had me in tears,"" he admitted. Following their visit, William and Kate attended a lunch reception at the NeueHouse, celebrating the British talent in creative industries based in New York. Guests in attendance included film producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Sir Patrick Stewart, J.Crew President Jenna Lyons, actress Archie Panjabi, and Downton Abbey producer Gareth Neame. William also paid a visit the Empire State Building Tuesday afternoon, accompanied by Mayor Bill de Blasio. The day's earlier heavy rain subsided and William walked the entire perimeter of the observation deck of the famous 86-story landmark, stopping to point out other landmarks and sights. Red, white, and blue lights had been adorning the top of the building in honor of the Royal visit. On Tuesday night, the Duke and Duchess attended a benefit dinner celebrating the 600th anniversary of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Crowds of onlookers lined up three deep to watch the couple exit their car on the corner of 82nd Street and Fifth Avenue. After the royal pair ascended the steps to the museum, they were greeted by a group of eight recent St. Andrews alumni, who were dressed in the traditional red robes worn at the college. Kate made a gesture suggesting she remembered the robes from her time at school. Kate wore a Jenny Packham dress that she has worn to several other galas before. William wore a classic black tuxedo. Excitement in the street . William and Kate arrived in New York City Sunday evening for their three-day trip -- their first visit to the Big Apple. Reporting from New York Monday morning, CNN royal correspondent Max Foster said Kate was the star of the show. Screams greeted the Duchess of Cambridge when she arrived at a children's craft group in Harlem, greeted by the first lady of New York City, Chirlane McCray, amid tight security. Meanwhile, William jetted down to Washington for a quick visit with President Obama at the White House. The visit underscored ""the special relationship"" between the United States and the United Kingdom, the White House said. Basketball, Jay Z and Beyonce . After speaking at a session of the World Bank about the need for an international effort to stop illegal wildlife trading, William jetted back to NYC, on a flight whose passengers also included CNN's Anderson Cooper. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also chatted with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton at a Royal Foundation reception Monday evening and even met Jay Z, Beyonce and King James -- also known as basketball star LeBron James -- at a basketball game at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. They also got a look at American-style protest as demonstrators marched outside Barclays Center in Brooklyn to show their anger about the lack of an indictment in the Eric Garner chokehold death.

"Jury selection is expected to begin Monday in the trial of former Major League pitcher Roger Clemens, nine months after the previous one ended in a mistrial. Federal prosecutors accuse Clemens of lying to Congress when lawmakers investigated the illicit use of steroids in professional baseball. The case -- involving one count of obstruction of Congress, three counts of making false statements and two counts of perjury -- was declared a mistrial in July after evidence previously ruled inadmissible was shown in court. It involved a video clip of a televised congressional hearing from 2008 in which a congressman referenced an affidavit from Laura Pettitte about purported steroid use encountered by her husband, former New York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte, Clemens and other players. U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton ruled in pre-trial proceedings that Laura Pettitte's testimony about steroid use was uncorroborated and inadmissible. Most of the extended video had played for the jury, however, before the judge realized it included the prohibited discussion. Prosecutors subsequently asked for a new trial, saying they did not intend to air the clip in question. ""This was a mistake, a regretful mistake,"" government attorney David Goodhand said in September, urging Walton to reject a defense motion to dismiss the indictment and prevent a new trial. Walton blasted prosecutors, declaring, ""I would hate to believe they just blatantly disregarded rulings that I made, but it's hard for me to reach any other conclusion."" Defense attorneys accused prosecutors of showing the clip deliberately and asked Walton to dismiss the six-count indictment. ""No doubt this was a calculated effort to make an end run around this court's ruling,"" Clemens defense attorney Michael Attanasio said at the time. ""The government's use of this particular exhibit was premeditated,"" the defense team wrote in a critique given to Walton in August, and was ""not as innocent as the government suggests."" The charges stem from Clemens' 2008 testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, during which he denied using anabolic steroids. Clemens has continually denied using performance-enhancing drugs during his professional baseball career.","Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday .

"(CNN) -- ""Family Guy"" fans are not letting Brian Griffin go gently into the night. After the Fox animated comedy killed the character in Sunday's episode, several fans have signed a Change.org petition pleading with creator Seth MacFarlane and Fox Broadcasting to bring Brian back. To many, the four-legged cast member was a necessary part of the Griffin family, and a replacement dog -- even one voiced by ""The Sopranos' "" Tony Sirico -- just isn't going to cut it. ""The writers of family guy didn't just kill off one of their creations, they killed off the dog who has lived in our homes for the last 15 years,"" reads the online petition. ""They killed the dog we all have come to love. They killed America's dog!"" On Tuesday morning, the petition had already amassed 35,000 signatures and counting. ""Brian Griffin was an important part of our viewing experience,"" the petition says. "" 'Family Guy' and Fox Broadcasting will lose viewers if Brian Griffin is not brought back to the show."" In Sunday's episode, titled ""Life of Brian,"" the dog's demise seemed pretty permanent. Brian was hit by a car attempting to play with his constant companion, baby Stewie, and the devious tot couldn't use his time machine to solve the heartbreaking problem. If Brian were to return, it wouldn't be the first time a TV show has resurrected a character, but Fox did already air a farewell to the smart and snarky pet. Interestingly, MacFarlane has yet to comment publicly on Brian's death, although a few creatives who've been involved with the series have spoken up. ""Wilfred"" executive producer David Zuckerman tweeted Monday that although he's no longer involved with ""Family Guy"" and knows ""the show's in good hands,"" he still hopes ""Brian isn't really dead."" For what it's worth, TV critic and author Alan Sepinwall believes ""Brian will stay dead just like Superman did,"" as does the New York Times' Dave Itzkoff, who speculated on Monday, ""Everyone will cover Family Guy just as fervently when the 'dead character' comes back in a week or two, right?"" Adding to hopes that Brian isn't gone for good is a website called BriansAnnouncement.com, spotted by Deadline Hollywood and Variety. Along with a road sign welcoming visitors to the Griffin family's hometown of Quahog, Rhode Island, there's a countdown clock for a ""special announcement from Brian"" in 10 days. And yet, Fox has said that the site is a hoax. Producer Steve Callaghan didn't drop any hints about such a site while speaking with E! News after Sunday's episode, although he did explain that the idea to kill off Brian caught on in the writers' room and was seen as ""a fun way to shake things up."" ""Our fans are smart enough and have been loyal to our show for long enough, to know that they can trust us,"" Callaghan told E!.

"The shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin and its galvanizing effect on African-Americans has often been compared to the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till. I have often resisted this comparison because it was what took place following Till's death -- the Montgomery Bus Boycott -- that made the death of the young man such a pivotal role in launching the civil rights movement. Yet there is no denying that the death of Martin has moved this generation of African-Americans in a way that we have not seen in a 40 years. This post-civil rights movement generation -- I am a member of it since I was born in November 1968 -- has often been reluctant to embrace a social justice agenda. Instead, too many have had a me-myself-and-I mentality. Very few issues have led this generation to say, ""Enough is enough!"" The Trayvon Martin case may be that catalyst that I and others have often said is long overdue. Many have asked, ""Well, what makes this case unique?"" To be honest, it's as simple as a young kid walking home from the store with a bag of Skittles and an iced tea, being seen as suspicious, and ending up dead. The legal system will sort out whether or not George Zimmerman was justified in shooting Martin, but that still doesn't change the reality that a young man is dead. So, we have to seek ways to end racial profiling; to end America's deadly obsession with guns; to end the fear that people have toward one another. It has been amazing to watch as millions across the country weighed in on the tragedy, signing petitions, organizing rallies and vigils and demanding changes to the Florida law that some believe contributed to Martin's death. Yes, there is anger and frustration. But nothing is wrong with folks being angry about Martin's death. During a recent interview with entertainer and humanitarian Harry Belafonte for my TV One Cable Network show, ""Washington Watch,"" he said that even the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. recognized the benefit of anger in a social justice movement. ""He said, 'We first need to be angry at our plight before we'll act upon changing our condition,'"" Belafonte said. ""So, anger is a necessary force. It's not so much that you're angry, it's what you do with your anger that finally determines the importance of anger."" That's why I vehemently disagree with my media colleagues who are quick to ask whether Zimmerman's arrest will quell the voices of anger and satisfy protesters. An arrest is one thing; having a jury and judge hear the evidence is another. Everyone I know who has been up in arms over this case understands that it's not about bounties, burning down buildings or lashing out at whites, Hispanics, police, prosecutors or anyone else. Those advocating hateful actions have no place even being interviewed. They represent a minuscule population, but often overshadow and distract from those doing the real, substantive work. But it is clear that there is a need to change a system that only responds to protests and outrage. Justice is supposed to be blind. But too often, especially for African-Americans, the feeling is that justice works for others and not us. But if we're going to see a true change in this nation when it comes to social justice and the legal system, it will have to be led by young people. It will be led by those college students who called themselves the ""Dream Defenders' in Florida who marched from Daytona Beach to Sanford on Easter weekend saying they were doing to so reach Dr. King's dream of a better America. It is going to require a 21st-century Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, the fearless, passionate and successful group that played a vital role in the civil rights movement, only to fall victim to more militant voices toward the end of the 1960s. This change in America will not take place only in the halls of the legislatures and Congress. It is going to have to take place in towns, cities, communities and homes. It truly must be bottom up and not top down. Belafonte, who was an adviser and funder to SNCC while also being a confidant to Dr. King, said the only way we are going to see a truly changed America is if the nation's young rise up in a moral army for good and righteousness. But he cautioned that it can't be exclusively the province of political leaders, which he says was a miscalculation of the civil rights movement. ""We had to have young, bright men and women sitting in places that could legislate the branches of government; that could write laws and become engaged,"" he said. ""And once we got them into the positions, we no longer had these people in the community servicing the growth and the counseling of Young Turks coming up. ""The grassroots infrastructure became the political infrastructure. We're now getting back to that, and I think we're getting back to that in a very healthy way.""","Roland Martin says he's resisted comparing the Florida shooting to the Emmett Till case .
Montgomery Bus Boycott came on the heels of that killing, he says .
Dr. King saw the value of well-directed anger, Harry Belafonte noted .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A rifle-wielding white supremacist entered Washington's Holocaust museum on Wednesday afternoon, fatally shooting a security guard before being wounded himself by return fire from other guards, authorities said. Stephen Tyrone Johns was shot and killed while working at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum on Wednesday. Stephen Tyrone Johns, a six-year veteran of the museum's security staff, later ""died heroically in the line of duty,"" said Sara Bloomfield, museum director. Law enforcement sources identified the suspect as James W. von Brunn, an 88-year-old white supremacist from Maryland. He is a known Holocaust denier who created an anti-Semitic Web site called ""The Holy Western Empire."" He has repeatedly claimed ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" a widely read book about a teenage girl's experiences under Nazi rule, was a hoax. The museum shooting occurred on a day the museum was to stage a play based on Anne Frank and two days before what would have her 80th birthday. Investigators found a notebook in the suspect's car listing other locations in Washington, a federal official told CNN. It was unclear what purpose the list served. Von Brunn allegedly entered the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum at 12:50 p.m. Wednesday and immediately shot Johns with a rifle, said Chief Cathy Lanier of the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department. Two other security guards returned fire, according to Lanier and the museum statement. Both Johns and Von Brunn were taken to George Washington University Hospital, said D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty. Johns died at the hospital. Von Brunn was in critical condition, Fenty said. Johns, 40, was a resident of Temple Hills, Maryland, according to a statement issued by Wackenhut Services Inc., which has provided security services at the museum since 2002. ""Obviously there are no words to express our grief and shock over the horrific event that took place at this museum today,"" Bloomfield, the museum director, said.  Witnesses: 'Panic' inside museum » . She said the museum was closed for the remainder of the day and would remain closed Thursday in honor of Johns.

"(CNN) -- Two days after fellow Jamaican sprinter Sherone Simpson received an 18-month doping suspension, former 100-meter world-record holder Asafa Powell was hit with the same penalty after testing positive for the same banned stimulant. He called the ruling ""unfair"" and ""patently unjust."" Powell confirmed Thursday in a statement sent to CNN through his agent Paul Doyle, that he had been sanctioned for having oxilofrine in his system. As in the case of Simpson -- who won gold in the 4x100-meter relay at the 2004 Olympics -- Powell plans to appeal the decision made by Jamaica's anti-doping disciplinary panel to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. ""This ruling is not only unfair, it is patently unjust,"" the 31-year-old Powell said in the statement. ""Panels such as these, I understood, were assembled to allow athletes who, consciously or unconsciously, come into conflict with the rules of sport, a chance at equitable redemption. ""Unfortunately, this was not the case."" Doyle said Tuesday that Simpson, 29, took a supplement which didn't list oxilofrine as an ingredient and Powell made the same defense. They are former training partners, The Jamaican Gleaner newspaper reported. Like Simpson, Powell tested positive at last year's Jamaican national championships and won't be allowed to return to competition until late December, with his ban backdated to last June. He could have been banned longer. ""I took a legal supplement -- Ephiphany D1,"" Powell said. ""As it turns out, that supplement was contaminated with oxilofrine. My team commissioned two private laboratories that confirmed that oxilofrine was present in the supplements, despite it not being listed as an ingredient on the bottle nor on it's website. ""I would also like to share that upon realizing that the supplement contained oxilofrine my team made contact with both the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), who not only ordered samples of the supplement from the manufacturer, but also tested and confirmed our findings."" Powell held the world record in the 100 meters for three years prior to countryman Usain Bolt breaking it. Besides once being the fastest man in the world, Powell teamed with Bolt and two others to claim gold in the 4x100-meter relay at the 2008 Olympics. He is also a two-time bronze medalist in the 100 meters at the world championships. It was the first time in nearly 12 years and more than 150 tests, Powell added, that one had an ""adverse"" finding. ""It is for a stimulant ... a stimulant that is only banned during competition and experts have declared has no performance enhancing effects,"" he said. ""Sanctions for a stimulant and this kind of infraction usually range from public warnings to a ban of three months, six months in the most extreme cases; I was and am still more than prepared to accept a sanction that is in line with the offense. ""Instead nine months later what has been handed down is clearly not based on the offense nor the facts surrounding it. ""I want to reiterate that I have never knowingly taken any banned substances, I did all the necessary checks before taking Ephiphany D1."" When contacted by CNN, WADA said it would review the reasons for Thursday's decision before deciding whether it would appeal.","Asafa Powell receives an 18-month suspension for testing positive for banned stimulant .

"More than 120 years after Vincent van Gogh's death, a new painting by the Dutch master has come to light. The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the largest collection of the artist's work, announced Monday the discovery of the newly identified painting, a landscape titled ""Sunset at Montmajour."" ""A discovery of this magnitude has never before occurred in the history of the Van Gogh Museum,"" the museum's director, Axel Ruger, said in a statement. Van Gogh is believed to have completed the relatively large painting in 1888, two years before his death and during ""a period that is considered by many to be the culmination of his artistic achievement,"" Ruger said. The picture depicts a landscape in the vicinity of Arles in the south of France, where van Gogh was working at that time, the museum said. Museum discovers 'new' van Gogh painting . Ruger said the museum attributed the painting to van Gogh after ""extensive research into style, technique, paint, canvas, the depiction, van Gogh's letters and the provenance."" Starting September 24, it will appear in ""Van Gogh At Work,"" an exhibition currently on show at the museum in Amsterdam. From the 'Sunflowers' period . Van Gogh (1853-1890) crafted some of the world's best known and most loved paintings, including ""Sunflowers,"" ""Irises"" and ""Starry Night,"" and a number of self-portraits. He painted ""Sunset at Montmajour"" during the same period in which he produced ""Sunflowers,"" Ruger said. Van Gogh achieved little recognition as an artist during his lifetime, but his reputation blossomed in the years after his suicide at the age of 37, following years of mental illness. His works now hang in leading museums and galleries around the world. During the art market boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s, three of van Gogh's works succeeded each other as the most expensive paintings ever sold: ""Sunflowers"" for $39.9 million, ""Irises"" for $53.9 million and ""Portrait of Dr. Gachet"" for $82.5 million. In its statement, the Van Gogh Museum didn't divulge the full story behind the discovery of ""Sunset at Montmajour,"" saying it would be published in the October edition of The Burlington Magazine, a fine art publication, and at the museum. Louis van Tilborgh and Teio Meedendorp, two senior researchers at the museum, said the painting had belonged to the collection of van Gogh's younger brother, Theo, in 1890 and was sold in 1901.

"(CNN)You just can't stop Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open. When the world No. 1 beat sixth-seed Andy Murray 7-6 (5) 6-7 (4) 6-3 6-0 in a contentious slugfest in Melbourne, he become only the second man to claim five Australian Open titles. And with Djokovic 27, odds are that he'll match Roy Emerson's record haul of six. Emerson was in attendance Sunday along with other Australian tennis legends, including Rod Laver. ""I love my time being here,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""Being mentioned in the elite group of legends in our sport is a huge privilege and honor. I can't say how proud I am. ""That's going to serve definitely only as a great deal of inspiration for the rest of my career."" This was the third time Djokovic downed the Scot in a final at Melbourne Park and how Murray will be ruing blowing a lead in the third set. Mind you, Djokovic let slip a 4-2 advantage in the second set and thus might have won in three if not for a lapse. Djokovic looked spent physically early in the second and in the opening stages of the third, by which time the two had been on court for almost three hours. He wobbled on his feet, struggled to get serves in play and went to ground after a rally. Not that Murray wanted to buy into any of it. He felt the Serb was bluffing and could be heard uttering on court about his friend: ""Don't worry about him, he does it all the time."" Murray, though, did let it get to him. ""He obviously looked like he was in quite a bad way at the beginning of the third set and came back unbelievable at the end of that set,"" Murray told reporters afterward. ""Then obviously the way he was hitting the ball in the fourth and moving was impressive. ""If it was cramp, how he recovered from it, that's a tough thing to recover from and play as well as he did at the end. ""So, yeah, I'm frustrated at myself for letting that bother me at the beginning of the third set, because I was playing well, I had good momentum, and then just dropped off for like 10 minutes and it got away from me."" Djokovic overturned a 2-0 hole in the third and saved a break point at 3-3 when he struck a drop volley that forced Murray into an error. Djokovic immediately urged the crowd to back him and they did. Energized, he didn't lose another game to collect his eighth major overall to join among others Murray's former coach, Ivan Lendl. A cool handshake at the net after roughly four hours of play followed. Murray, too, didn't laugh during the trophy presentation when new dad Djokovic wished him and fiancee Kim Sears ""many kids"" in the future. Djokovic denied he was feigning injury or trying to throw Murray off his game. ""The length of the rallies and the physicality that we had in the first two sets have taken an energy from me,"" Djokovic said. ""It's normal to expect that you can't always be, you know, at your 100%. ""So you go through some particular moments that you can call crises during matches like these. This is what I had in these 15, 20 minutes. After that I felt better."" If Murray wasn't best pleased with Djokovic's antics, he should also spare some criticism for his own second serve. Against the elite Murray's second serve can be the source of trouble and on Sunday Djokovic captured 66% of those points. Djokovic began the final flawlessly, hitting 10 winners and one unforced error to build a commanding 4-1 lead. Broken at 4-2, Djokovic regained the break but injured his thumb when he slipped near the net. Temporarily frazzled, Djokovic couldn't serve out the set and called for the trainer. A Murray double fault at 4-2 in the tiebreak -- a double fault by Murray in a tiebreak in the 2013 final was costly -- and later a missed volley gifted Djokovic the first. Djokovic won 13 straight points at one stage in the second set to reverse a break deficit but said a brief stoppage after two protestors ran on court in the middle of the second halted his progression. A strong start from Murray in the tiebreak was enough to see him level the affair. By this time he was clearly in the ascendancy and needed to put Djokovic -- who had lost five of his previous seven grand slam finals -- away. The knockout blow never came and Djokovic ultimately improved to 8-1 in his last nine matches against Murray. He ended the match as he began it, making a paltry three unforced errors in the fourth. ""I started hitting the ball more, covering the court better, shortening the points,"" said Djokovic. Yet Murray did something this fortnight he wasn't able to achieve last year as he recovered from back surgery -- land in a grand slam final. ""We put in a lot of hard work to try to get back in this position after what was a difficult year last year,"" he told the crowd, referring to his entourage. ""Unfortunately I couldn't do it tonight but I'm a little bit closer than I was a few months ago and I'll keep working hard to get there."" Like Saturday's women's winner, Serena Williams, Djokovic has never been beaten past the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park. A pair of veterans won Sunday's mixed doubles title. Leander Paes and Martina Hingis, who flourished for the Washington Kastles in World Team Tennis, beat Daniel Nestor and Kristina Mladenovic 6-4 6-3. Paes is 41 and Hingis is 34.","Novak Djokovic beats Andy Murray in the Australian Open final .

"Everyone loves a good get-back-up, Rocky-style story. But inspirational tales don't always have to star a guy in shiny shorts -- or a big city like Philadelphia. Sometimes the best against all odds tales are real ones, taking place in unsung towns, led by regular citizens energized to resuscitate once thriving destinations just as they appeared flat on the mat. Even big, star-studded cities face struggles and off decades, but what's kept Main Street, USA alive amid interstates, mega-malls, national chains and closed stagecoach routes? The heart and hard work of historic rebound towns like these. Coronado, California: The little peninsula that could . Then: A storied SoCal getaway for adventure-seeking aristocrats and their servants stretching back to the Victorian era, Coronado suffered in the late 20th century with a 35 percent vacancy rate along its historic main drag, Orange Avenue, leaving locals wondering how to prevent this pretty peninsula on the far side of San Diego Bay from drowning. Now: One of the country's most successfully revitalized coastal resort communities draws crowds of vacationers and window shoppers over the boomerang-shaped San Diego-Coronado Bridge onto streets lined with flowers and fully restored classical revival-style buildings. Wow: The iconic Hotel del Coronado (aka ""The Del"") remains one of the world's grandest landmarks and most resilient beach hotels, with a who's who guest list of celebs and dignitaries several generations long. Paducah, Kentucky: Small town with big art . Then: In the 1980s, historic Lower Town was 20 square blocks of once-beautiful homes blighted by crime and neglect. Its commercial center sat 70 percent vacant. Now: More than $100 million in investment later, those same blocks are home to a vibrant arts and small business community that's now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. With brick- and tree-lined sidewalks that attract more than $200 million in annual tourist income, the town underwrites an Artist Relocation Program that's drawing resident artists and international visitors, and is considered a national model for utilizing the arts for municipal resurrection. Wow: Held each May, the Lower Town Arts & Music Festival was recently tapped among the state's top spring festivals, featuring Western Kentucky's best art, music, theater and food. New Iberia, Louisiana: Reborn on the bayou . Then: Founded by the Spanish in 1779 (originally called Nueva Iberia) and home to five brick factories in the 1890s, this vintage bayou town's main street was a barren row of boarded-up shops not long ago, with its decaying landmark art deco theater, the Evangeline, looking like the sad inspiration for a forgotten Jim Carrey movie. Now: New Iberia's latest renaissance has yielded a Great American Main Street Award and a revitalized commercial district featuring hot (and hot) Cajun eateries, rows of new shops and the beautifully restored Evangeline (now Sliman) Theater -- home to Louisiana Live Cajun and ""swamp pop"" concerts. Wow: High points of a town tour include the pin-up antebellum mansion, Shadows-on-the-Teche, and the original Tabasco factory and 250-acre Jungle Gardens on Avery Island, just seven miles down the road. Frederick, Maryland: After the flood... cute shopping! Then: Once a hospice for Civil War casualties, this proud Colonial-era city endured late 20th-century battle fatigue after getting sidestepped by a new interstate, losing its retail core to outlying shopping malls and being hit by a massive flood in the mid-1970s that turned nearly 100 acres of its historic downtown into a temporary swamp. Now: Frederick is revived, with a nearly chain-proof red brick commercial district lined with indie shops, destination restaurants and weekenders from D.C. and Baltimore (both about an hour away) escaping here instead of the other way around. Wow: Stroll along Carroll Creek Park's pedestrian bridges and brick pathways lined with public art and it's hard to believe this green space was originally a flood control project. Ely, Nevada: The mettle of nowhere . Then: Originally a Pony Express station, this remote Nevada town's mineral mining fortunes boomed and busted through the 20th century, taking their biggest toll during the 1970s copper market crash. Now: Copper is back, as is gold mining, but Ely's latest boom is as a weekend escape between Las Vegas, Reno and Salt Lake City (the nearest major town, 241 miles away). Way out on Highway 50 (aka The Loneliest Road in America), you'll find wallet-friendly Wild West imagery like the Hotel Nevada & Gambling Hall (from 1929), the Jailhouse Casino's Cell Block Steak House (fine dining behind bars) and several land-of-the-lost state parks about as busy as the moon. Wow: You can augment the Western experience by boarding an authentic steam-powered train on the Ely-based Nevada Northern Railway for a 90-minute chug through the Silver State's timeless outback. DeLand, Florida: Classic revivalist . Then: Conceived in the 1870s as an ""Athens of Florida"" (emphasizing education and culture) by baking soda baron Henry DeLand, the small but big-thinking central Florida community gave rise to grand Victorian homes and Stetson University before succumbing to financial hardship, deteriorating neighborhoods and 75 percent downtown vacancy in the mid-1980s. Now: After a magical civic recovery an hour from Disney World, downtown DeLand's rows of shops, restaurants and museums along Woodland Boulevard and Indiana Avenue include the restored 1921 art deco Athens Theater, nearby Artisan Alley and a revived Garden District that inspired an award-winning documentary about urban renewal. Wow: Housed in the basement of an old bank building, the Mainstreet Grill has been voted DeLand's best restaurant for more than a decade, and serves a ""Spectacular Sunday Brunch Buffet"" to prove it. Libertyville, Illinois: Revival, take two . Then: Established as a bedroom community for Chicago's elite in the early-mid-20th century, Libertyville receded into drab suburb status in later decades. Its first stab at revitalization in the 1960s -- a poorly conceived series of modernization projects dubbed Operation Face-Lift -- led only to more boarded-up storefronts over the next 20 years. Now: Unveiling its old Victorian facades and regaining its roots as a homey, Midwestern Americana detour from the big city, Libertyville's four-block epicenter along Milwaukee Avenue (35 miles from the Loop, and a world apart) is lined with boutiques, foodie shops and an important microbrewery (Mickey Finn's) on Windy City pub hop maps. Wow: If it's Thursday between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., it's Farmer's Market time (June-October) on Church Street across from Cook Park -- a tradition for more than three decades. El Dorado, Arkansas: Raising the boom . Then: Home to a 1920s oil rush that brought high hopes, rows of new buildings and 30,000 people to ""Arkansas' Original Boomtown,"" the golden opportunity of El Dorado's namesake gave way to the Great Depression and perpetual economic hardship. By 1980, the town's commercial district was barely ticking. Now: Thanks to one huge civic mobilization, mass restorations, a new $14.4 million conference facility and a roster of annual festivals, El Dorado has recouped its reputation as ""the pride of south Arkansas."" The once desolate downtown is now lined with more than 65 specialty shops, eateries, inns and the state's only operating art deco theater. Wow: Each May, the Bugs, Bands & Bikes festival features thousands of revving motorcycles gathered for a bike show/parade and a two-day Battle of the Bands -- all seasoned with hundreds of pounds of the region's best crawfish.

"(CNN)When they've met at grand slams recently, Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka haven't disappointed. The two combined to orchestrate another great spectacle at the Australian Open and this time it was world No. 1 Djokovic who outlasted the defending champion to book his spot in the final. Last year, Wawrinka had downed Djokovic 9-7 in the fifth set when the pair met in the quarterfinals in Melbourne en route to breaking the stranglehold of tennis' Big Four but the Serb prevailed Friday 7-6 (1) 3-6 6-4 4-6 6-0 in a match that had more plot twists than a low-budget horror movie. When Djokovic clinched the hard fought affair -- it was the fourth straight time the pair went to five sets at a grand slam -- he joined Roger Federer and Stefan Edberg as the only men in the Open Era to make five finals in Melbourne. Djokovic improved to 9-0 in semifinals and finals at the Australian Open and that includes three wins over his opponent in the final, Andy Murray. On Thursday, Murray won an ill-tempered clash against Tomas Berdych that landed the Scot's fiancee in hot water. Djokovic's streak appeared to be in jeopardy as the fifth set began, however. With the Serb creaking, Wawrinka erred on break point in the first game when he sent a routine backhand long. Djokovic took advantage of a deflated Wawrinka to break in the next game and didn't look back. While the duo combined to make 118 unforced errors -- to go along with only 69 winners -- there was drama aplenty and still some brilliant shot-making. ""Describe the match? Strange,"" Wawrinka told reporters. Wawrinka needed eye drops to rectify an issue in the first set and Djokovic had to be told by the chair umpire that he won the third set, such was his level of concentration. Djokovic blew a break lead in the fourth and Wawrinka hit one of the shots of the tournament -- a backhand drop volley -- to save a break point later in the fourth. On other occasions, he drew gasps from the crowd by crushing his flat, one-handed backhand. Whereas Djokovic looked solid on his serve in his previous five matches, Wawrinka broke him five times. But the Swiss not only lost his first tiebreak of the tournament -- having previously gone 5-0 -- he imploded and was thumped 7-1. ""It was very emotional, very tense, as it always is against a top player in the semifinals of a grand slam,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""Of course, judging by the last two matches we played here ... we could expect something like that, a five-setter. So the battle was great. ""It was no different this year from the previous two years in terms of, you know, fighting from both sides. The only difference was that the fifth set went completely my way. ""But, again, it was a tight first opening game of the fifth set where he had some break point opportunities, missed an easy ball."" Despite the topsy-turvy nature of the semifinal, Djokovic claimed he was content with his form ahead of the final against Murray, his longtime friend and tennis rival. ""I think I have much more positive things to reflect on in my game and then all the matches that I played so far in the tournament than the negative,"" Djokovic said. ""I'm in the finals. At the end of the day, that's why I'm here, you know, to try to get far in the tournament. ""Getting to the finals in any way possible is a great achievement. I'm going to try to use that for build up of the confidence for finals."" His record against Murray in Australia -- he defeated the sixth seed in the 2011 and 2013 finals -- works in Djokovic's favor. But then, in both of Murray's grand slam successes, he beat Djokovic in the final. ""He's been playing some great tennis these couple weeks,"" said Djokovic. ""From my side, it's going to be necessary to perform at my best and play the best match of the tournament if I want to win. ""Obviously it's finals. There's no clear favorite. But as you mentioned, the record I have in finals against him here in Australia, we played couple times, can serve maybe as a slight mental edge. But not much. ""I don't think he's going to feel that on the court. I'm sure he's going to be very motivated to win his first title here. I'm going to, of course, give my best that that doesn't happen."" Cause for concern for Serena? Like Djokovic, Serena Williams has never tasted defeat at the Australian Open once she's progressed past the quarterfinals. The world No. 1 holds a 16-2 record against her foe in Saturday's women's final, Maria Sharapova. But the 18-time grand slam winner cut short a first practice session Friday because she was unwell. She went on to practice later. ""I had a false start (this morning),"" Williams said in a statement. ""I wasn't feeling really well. I've been sick with a cold all week and I got better, then I got worse this morning. ""I just had to go back (to the hotel), relax and take a nap, rejuvenate my body. I rescheduled practice for this afternoon. It went well ... I felt better."" If the second-ranked Sharapova snaps her 15-match losing streak against Williams, she would claim a first major outside Roland Garros in seven years.","Novak Djokovic makes the Australian Open final .

"A days-long raid on a northeast Nigerian town by Boko Haram left dozens dead and displaced more than 15,000 residents, Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency reports. Scores of fighters armed with rocket-propelled grenades, explosives and guns descended on the town of Damboa early Thursday evening, residents and officials said. By the time the raid ended on Sunday, 66 residents had been killed and more than 15,000 had fled, NEMA spokesman Abdulkadir Ibrahim said. ""We lost 46 people on Thursday through Friday in Damboa and the gunmen pursued people who fled to nearby Fori and Kwairi villages where they killed 20 more,"" Sheriff Muhammad, a spokesman for the Damboa local authority, said. The Islamic militant group's trademark black flag was hoisted afterward, signifying that the town was under their control. ""Boko Haram have taken over Damboa where they erected their flags after the attack that forced all residents to flee,"" said Sheriff Mohammed. But the Nigerian military tried to assure residents that it would retake the town. ""We are not conceding any portion of this country to any terrorist group,"" said Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade, a Defense Ministry spokesman.  ""We are going to reverse every form of insecurity in that area very soon."" Boko Haram launched an offensive against Damboa's military base and police station July 4 that left six soldiers and five policeman dead, according to Nigeria's defense ministry.  But 50 militants were also killed that day, leading residents such as Ahmed Buba to think they had returned to exact revenge. ""We were defenseless because all the security personnel, including soldiers and policemen, have withdrawn,"" Buba said. Boko Haram -- whose name translates to ""Western education is forbidden"" in the  Hausa language -- caused international outrage when it abducted 276 girls on April 14 from a Nigerian boarding school.","Boko Haram raid kills 66 in northeastern town of Damboa in Nigeria .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi waited until injury time to break Iranian hearts Saturday and give Argentina a scarcely deserved 1-0 victory in Belo Horizonte in a Group F clash. Iran had come close to pulling off a major upset with a series of second half chances until Messi found space just outside the penalty area to fire home an unstoppable shot. It was his eighth goal in his last seven appearances for Argentina and could not have been more timely, a second win securing his side a last 16 place with a group match to spare. Messi had also scored what turned out to be the crucial second goal in Argentina's 2-1 win over World Cup debutant Bosnia Herzegovina to open its Brazil 2014 campaign. Before his superb strike, the four-time FIFA World Player of the Year had been kept largely quiet by the dogged defense of the Iran, who had drawn with Nigeria in its opener. Argentina dominated possession in the first half, but Iran's Jalal Hosseini had perhaps the best chance -- however the defender headed over the bar from a corner. Iran took the upper hand after the break, with Reza Ghoochannejad heading straight at goalkeeper Sergio Romero in the 53rd minute when he should have scored. Ashkan Dejagah then appeared to have won a penalty soon after when he was brought down in the area by Pablo Zabaleta, but Serbian referee Milorad Mazic waved play on. Dejagah was denied a goal in the 67th minute when the forward beat Zabaleta to a cross, but saw his header tipped over the bar by Romero. Reza also had a great opportunity to secure a famous victory with five minutes remaining, but it was Romero again to the rescue for Argentina with another fine save. ""They made the game very difficult for us,"" admitted Argentine coach Alejandro Sabella after his side's last-gasp victory. ""Messi was marked very tightly, but he showed perseverance, patience, attitude and always looked for the goal. He never gave up."" Sabella's Iranian counterpart Carlos Queiroz also praised Messi, but was unimpressed by the referee's performance in denying his side a second half penalty. ""Messi was fantastic, but the referee wasn't,"" said the former Real Madrid coach. ""I don't understand it, he had to have seen it was a penalty. He was five meters away, there is no way he couldn't have seen it."" Nigeria 1-0 Bosnia . Later Saturday, Nigeria consolidated second spot in Group F behind Argentina with a 1-0 win in Cuiaba over Bosnia, who are eliminated. Peter Odemwingie's 29th minute goal secured victory for the Super Eagles, who drew with Iran in the opening round of matches. Bosnia was left to curse its luck, with Edin Dzeko having a goal mistakenly ruled out for offside in the first half, while in stoppage time the Manchester City striker saw his effort strike the post. But Nigeria also carried an attacking threat and Emmanuel Emenike might have added a second only to see his late effort go just wide of the post. It was Nigeria's first win at a World Cup since 1998 and they will face Argentina in the final group games Thursday.","Argentina beats Iran 1-0 for second win in Group F .

"As Thomas Eric Duncan remains in isolation at a hospital in Dallas, and American journalist Ashoka Mukpo prepares to be transported home, many are wondering: Will they receive an experimental drug like other Ebola patients treated in the United States? Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol received an experimental serum called ZMapp, engineered from antibodies harvested in mice. Questions remain about the extent to which ZMapp was responsible for the patients' recovery, but demand for the drug has skyrocketed. Unfortunately, the process used to make the doses given to Brantly, Writebol and a few other patients is costly and time-consuming. Public health officials are now looking for ways to develop more of this experimental drug quickly. Tobacco plants may hold the key. In the world of health and medicine, the word tobacco usually brings to mind cancer, emphysema and heart disease. But in recent years the plant's tarnished reputation is getting a makeover from the development of pharmaceuticals through an effective, swift and cost-cutting technique that has been dubbed ""biopharming."" Tobacco plant-based drugs are not a new concept. But there are no treatments currently developed through tobacco plants that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. That may change as the deadly Ebola virus continues to spread through West Africa, where it has killed more than 3,300. Kentucky BioProcessing in Owensboro was one of the first biopharmaceutical companies tasked with developing the ZMapp serum through tobacco plants. The company has been working in collaboration with San Diego-based Mapp Biophamaceutical, which developed the ZMapp vaccine, since August. Eyes have also turned to Texas-based biotechnology company Caliber Biotherapeutics, which that same month claimed it was ready to fast-track the drug if need be. The company, which says it operates the largest tobacco-based pharmaceutical facility in the world, has been working on cutting costs and increasing quantities of certain cancer drugs through genetically modified tobacco. Drugs and vaccines are manufactured in a variety of ways. Flu vaccines, for example, are most commonly produced by injecting fertilized hen eggs with the virus. The virus is incubated for days so it can replicate, be harvested, inactivated or weakened, and then made into either a flu shot or nasal spray. The process can cost around $150 million each year, using $600,000 eggs each day. Tobacco plants can produce antibodies in much less time for a fraction of the cost, advocates say. The process begins by cloning a gene and inserting it into a virus. That infected gene is then injected into the tobacco plant, where it multiplies within the leaves before it is extracted and purified. Unlike with egg-based and mammalian cell-based products, each tobacco plant can produce enough antibodies for dozens of doses of a pharmaceutical, experts say. The plants are also easy to contain and manufacture in controlled environments such as greenhouses. Medicago Inc., a biopharmaceutical company in North Carolina, produced 10 million flu vaccines in 30 days using tobacco plants in a federally funded effort called ""Blue Angel."" The program tested the prospect of rapid vaccine production in the hypothetical case of a global health pandemic. It is estimated the company could make as many as 100 million doses for as little as $36 million. The Canadian biopharmaceutical company PlantForm is using tobacco to produce a drug that reduces the growth rate of breast cancer tumors. The drug is a ""biosimilar"" form of a current drug on the market called Herceptin, usually produced by creating antibodies in mammalian cells from hamsters' ovaries. The current treatment costs up to $100,000 per patient, according to PlantForm. The company estimates up to $120 million could be saved by 2017 by manufacturing the drug with tobacco plants instead. One of the pioneering programs to use tobacco for vaccine manufacturing is the University of Louisville's Owensboro Cancer Research Program in Kentucky. Since 2007, it has used a relative of tobacco, called nicotiana benthamiana, to develop vaccines for everything from cholera to cervical cancer. In August, the center announced it had received a $14.7 million grant to produce a gel made from crushed tobacco leaves that prevents HIV transmission. The process involves isolating a protein called griffithsin, which can be found in red algae. The protein fends off HIV by sticking onto the outer surface of an HIV-infected cell, shielding noninfected cells from the virus. Once isolated, the protein is injected into the tobacco plant and then extracted 12 days later. It is then crushed, purified and mixed into a gel that can be used as a lubricant. ""Our hope is for the gel to be as effective as the condom,"" senior scientist Dr. Kenneth Palmer said. Palmer, a native of Zimbabwe, has been studying plant-based pharmaceuticals since 1997 when he received his doctorate at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. Before working with tobacco, Palmer studied the prospects of using corn to develop pharmaceuticals. But while edible plants are just as well-suited as tobacco for biopharming, Palmer said they are not the way to go: . ""You don't want to risk contaminating the food supply with pharmaceuticals."" Your Ebola questions answered . One company learned that the hard way. In 2002, ProdiGene, a biopharmaceutical company based out of College Station, Texas, was fined $3 million after a corn-produced vaccine for diabetes and diarrhea nearly contaminated a crop of soybeans in Nebraska and Iowa. The incident ignited a massive backlash against the development of plant-based pharmaceuticals, and the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture implemented new and stricter regulations for field-testing of pharmaceuticals engineered through food crops. To date, there is only one plant-based pharmaceutical approved by the FDA: Elelyso, which contains an enzyme engineered through carrot cells. The medication treats Gaucher's disease, a rare genetic disorder that stops cells and organs from functioning properly. Palmer doesn't blame the FDA for the bottleneck in biopharmaceutical approval. Rather, he concedes that compared with competing technology used to make pharmaceuticals, biopharming is still relatively new. He sees the success of ZMapp as a big catalyst for movement in the industry: . ""Unfortunate as it is, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is a huge leg up for the field,"" Palmer said. ""I think it will only help validate the technology as a viable option."" Complete coverage on Ebola .","Experimental serum used to treat Ebola being developed using tobacco plants .

"President Obama and Mitt Romney have turned China into an election-year flashpoint, with both candidates talking tough and putting some of the blame for America's economic woes on the growing eastern power. The rhetorical fight has included barbs on manufacturing and jobs, while accusations have flown on intellectual property violations and unfair trade practices. ""China has been a currency manipulator for years and years,"" Mitt Romney said at last week's debate, adding that if elected, he would label China a ""currency manipulator"" on his first day in office. He also accused China of ""cheating"" and pledged a ""crack down on China."" Obama was more circumspect, but also said Romney had ""invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries -- in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks."" As the final debate begins Monday evening, the focus will fall entirely on international affairs and China will once again be on the agenda. Both Romney and Obama's China-related comments during the debate last week irked Donald Gross, author of ""The China Fallacy."" ""They're scapegoating China to shift blame to foreigners for America's serious economic problems,"" Gross said, referring to both campaigns. ""They're actually exploiting the vulnerabilities, the insecurities that many Americans have about the economy and about the future."" ""I think it's particularly dangerous to engage in that China bashing because it appeals to latent, but yet prevalent, anti-Asian prejudices that lie below the surface in many areas of the country."" The tough rhetoric portraying China as an economic boogeyman did not go unnoticed by Chinese netizens who took to Sina Weibo, the biggest microblog in the country. ""America can't solve its own problem so it always uses China as an excuse,"" wrote @Longhuachuntian127. Another user, @Shoujiyonghu 3031271431 wrote: ""China's stealing American jobs? Would you come here to get the job and paid one dollar per hour? Shameless (Romney)!"" Weibo user, @Guanbenweibodingduanguandian took issue with the way Romney portrayed China as a currency manipulator and wrote, ""America is the true currency manipulator OK? Why blame it on China? Why don't you Americans show how your exchange rates are calculated?"" Chinese sentiment toward the U.S. has cooled in the past few years, according to polling by the Pew Global Attitudes Project. In 2010, 68% of Chinese characterized their country's relationship with the U.S. as one of cooperation, while just 8% said it was one of hostility. Two years later, only 39% described ties with the U.S. in terms of cooperation, and 26% say they are hostile. Although the Chinese initially supported Obama prior to his election in 2008, their enthusiasm has waned. Four years ago, 62% expressed confidence in his ability to do the right thing in world affairs.  Today, only 38% of the Chinese surveyed expressed confidence. Both Chinese and U.S. citizens find themselves in the midst of leadership transition. On November 8, just two days after the U.S. presidential elections, China will begin its once-in-a-decade leadership transition that will reshape the top ranks of the Communist Party.","During second debate, Obama, Romney talked tough on China .

"Three years ago, director Richard Linklater made a movie about a mortician named Bernie Tiede who went to prison after he shot a rich, cranky widow four times in the back with her armadillo gun and hid her body in a deep freezer under the pot pies. Now he's Tiede's landlord. Tiede, who was convicted of the 1996 murder of a wealthy Texas widow named Marjorie Nugent, was released from prison on Tuesday. Originally sentenced to life, he has been set free on a $10,000 bond -- with conditions. One of them is that he live in a garage apartment owned by Linklater, the Austin, Texas-based director of such films as ""Before Sunrise,"" ""Dazed and Confused,"" ""School of Rock"" and 2011's ""Bernie,"" based on Tiede's case. That's OK. Linklater offered up the place. It's another strange twist in a case that's been full of them. For years, Tiede was a cheerful, well-regarded funeral director in the town of Carthage, Texas. As recounted in Skip Hollandsworth's Texas Monthly story ""Midnight in the Garden of East Texas,"" the townspeople were four-square behind Tiede, despite the fact that he'd admitted to Nugent's murder --  and stored her body in a freezer for several months. ""I had been so flummoxed by the twists and turns of this case for the last 17 years,"" Hollandsworth told CNN's Ed Lavandera. ""I just couldn't imagine what was going to happen next, and here it comes. A turn of events that if you put a bunch of A-List screenwriters into the same room and told them to put out a new Bernie story, they never could have come up with this."" Hollandsworth described Tiede as ""the nicest guy in town. He ran the campaign for the Boy Scout fundraiser. He raised money for the new wing of the Sunday school building. He bought the trophy shop when it went out of business so the kids could keep getting the trophies. He was a kind of Robin Hood. He was this man who cared about people. And most of all he cared about them at their deaths, giving them this dignified funeral, and leading them into the next life. People loved what he did for them. ""Wherever you go in Carthage, there are people who look up to Bernie as if he is a saint.  And that he just made one little mistake with Mrs. Nugent. Just one,"" Hollandsworth said. ""There are lots of Christian men in Carthage, these people say, who make two, three, four or more mistakes.   And we forgive them, why can't we forgive Bernie for just making one mistake of shooting a lady in the back four times?"" Nugent wasn't as beloved. ""If she had held her nose any higher,"" one man was quoted in Hollandsworth's article, ""she would have drowned in a rainstorm."" Another resident told prosecutor Danny Buck Davidson, ""She was so mean that even if Bernie did kill her, you won't be able to find anyone in town who's going to convict him for murder."" Tiede had befriended Nugent after her husband's death. He eventually became a close confidant -- they even traveled together -- and sole heir to her $10 million fortune. However, according to the article, the demanding Nugent also treated Tiede poorly. Sometime in late 1996, he shot her to death. Tiede was convicted of Nugent's murder in 1999. Linklater was fascinated by the case. ""I knew Bernie and this town. I just knew this world so well,"" he told the Austin American-Statesman in 2012. In Linklater's film, Tiede was played by Jack Black and Nugent by Shirley MacLaine. Matthew McConaughey, then beginning the career upswing that eventually led to his Oscar earlier this year for ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" played Davidson. It was ""Bernie"" that helped get Bernie out of prison. According to The Washington Post, attorney Jodi Cole saw the film at a Texas Monthly screening and was troubled by some of the issues it raised.    Taking Tiede as a client, she learned he had been sexually abused. Armed with that evidence, as well as a belief the sentence was unduly harsh, she got Tiede's sentence reduced to time served. Cole said the parties involved are not allowed to comment on Tuesday's court proceeding. She added that it was part of the bond's conditions. Nugent's family isn't happy with Tiede's release. ""Bernie Tiede committed a cold-blooded, calculated murder, killing our mother and grandmother, Marjorie Nugent, in her home,"" Ryan Gravatt, a Nugent family spokesman, said in a statement. ""He confessed to her murder and his confession was admitted in his trial. A jury found him guilty and sentenced him to life in prison, where he should remain."" Nugent's granddaughter said the drama surrounding Tiede has taken attention away from his victim. ""It seems like we've forgotten about my grandmother in all of this storytelling, and it doesn't feel like we're getting justice for the murder victim in this case,"" Shanna Nugent said. And the movie hasn't helped, she said. ""A lot of people's opinions about this are all based on the movie, which is a fiction,"" the granddaughter said. ""This isn't a fiction for my family. This is real life for my family."" Carthage residents, however, generally approve of Tiede's release. James Baker, who knew Tiede, told Tyler, Texas, TV station KLTV, ""I'm glad that he's out."" ""I don't think that he's a threat to anybody anywhere,"" he added, ""but in the back of my mind you do say well, he did murder her and put her in a freezer.""","In 1996, Bernie Tiede killed rich Texas widow and hid her in a freezer .

"Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel writes in a new ad campaign that the crisis in Gaza and Israel is a battle between ""those who celebrate life and those who champion death."" Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor and author who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, begins with a reference to Abraham, who is considered the father of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Wiesel cites the story of God stopping Abraham from sacrificing his son Isaac. ""Jews rejected child sacrifice 3,500 years ago. Now it's Hamas' turn,"" the headline reads. Wiesel calls Hamas a ""death cult."" ""Do the two cultures that brought us the Psalms of David and the rich libraries of the Ottoman Empire not share a love of life, of transmitting wisdom and opportunity to their children? And is any of this discernible in the dark future offered by Hamas to Arab children, to be suicide bombers or human shields for rockets? ""Palestinian parents want a hopeful future for their children, just like Israeli parents do. And both should be joining together in peace."" Hamas' political leader Khaled Meshaal, who lives in Qatar, presented a very different view of the conflict in an interview with CNN -- and denied that Hamas uses human shields. Wiesel, in the ad, calls on ""the Palestinian people to find true Muslims to represent them, Muslims who would never voluntarily place a child in danger."" He asks U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders to speak out against Hamas. Obama has discussed Middle East peace with Wiesel in the past. The ad campaign appears in some U.S. papers in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and Washington, according to This World: The Values Network, a group that says it is committed to ""bringing Jewish values to mainstream American culture as a way of healing and strengthening families, diverting society's focus from material greed and inspiring children to emulate caring, compassionate relationships."" ""We all lament the loss of Palestinian life brought about by the murderous Hamas regime,"" founder Rabbi Shmuley Boteach said, according to the organization's website.

"A crabbing expedition turned tragic Saturday morning when a boat capsized off Northern California, killing four people, a Sheriff's Office spokeswoman said. A fifth person was able to cling to a rock and was rescued, . The sole survivor, 66-year-old Phillip Sanchez, told authorities that he and the others had set off around 8:30 a.m. (11:30 a.m. ET) Saturday on their 32-foot fishing boat, according to a Sonoma County Sheriff's Office news release. Other boats were out on the water for the opening day of crabbing season, sheriff's spokeswoman Sgt. Cecile Focha said. Yet conditions weren't ideal, with seas at 9 feet and winds of 17.5 knots (20 mph). Sanchez's private boat was hit and flipped over by what Focha described as a ""rogue wave"" in Bodega Bay, about 60 miles north of San Francisco. ""The boat pitched, and they were all thrown from the boat,"" the spokeswoman said. Responding authorities from the Coast Guard and Sheriff's Office found four people unresponsive in the water about 40 yards offshore. One was pronounced dead there, while Coast Guard and Bodega Bay fire boats brought the three others to a nearby Coast Guard station. Once there, medical personnel performed CPR in the ambulance. None of the three -- Jessie Daniel Langley, 79; Samuel Garcia, 86; and David Costa, 60 -- survived. Langley and Garcia were both from Bodega Bay. Costa was from Ripon, California. The Sheriff's Office said it wasn't disclosing the identity of the fourth victim until the next of kin had been informed. While Focha didn't know exactly how long the men had been in the water, she said conditions were perilous with rough seas and water temperatures around 59 degrees Fahrenheit. Sanchez, meanwhile, had swum and clung to an isolated, barnacle-filled outcropping known as Bodega or Seal Rock. As Focha explained, boats can't pull up to the rock, so a Sonoma County Sheriff's helicopter was brought in and a deputy at the end of a 100-foot line pulled Sanchez up to safety. Dressed in a T-shirt and jeans, Sanchez was taken to a Santa Rosa hospital because he was ""very cold"" and for treatment of scrapes and abrasions, presumably from the sharp rocks, the Sheriff's Office said. Authorities do not believe that alcohol or drugs played any part in the incident. While life vests were onboard the vessel, no one was wearing them when the boat capsized.

"Saira Murillo is just one of 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country who was specifically excluded from signing up for the Affordable Care Act, but it wasn't until recently that she found a way around the system. ""I didn't realize that as a DACA recipient, I would also be eligible to receive health insurance. It was thanks to a professor who told me and other undocumented students about our eligibility for Medi-Cal,"" Murillo told CNN en Español. Deferred status, or DACA, refers to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program enacted in 2012. It grants some undocumented youths temporary work authorization and a two-year reprieve from deportation. ""States like California and New York have realized that because of their higher undocumented immigrant population, it makes more sense to offer preventative care regardless of legal status,"" said Alvaro Huerta, staff attorney for the National Immigration Law Center. In the meantime, California, Washington state, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington, D.C., offer health insurance to low-income individuals granted deferred status. It's creative workaround of the ACA restrictions because the states are not using federal funds for the programs. ""Normally, someone with deferred action status would be considered lawfully present for all purposes on a federal level, which would mean that those DACA grantees would've been included in the ACA except that was changed about two months after the DACA program was announced,"" Huerta said. The administration still has time to reverse the rule because it haven't released a finalized rule, Huerta added. 'Deferred status' still means no federal health insurance . No access to those federal tax credits . Being DACA grantees also means that in addition to being given a valid Social Security number and the chance to get a driver's license, they are also given a work permit, on which they pay state and federal taxes. But because of the rule change, they aren't eligible for federal tax credits that help make private insurance affordable in the insurance marketplaces. Even though they're a part of the workforce, the DACA program was not intended to provide federal financial assistance for health care. ""Instead, DACA is designed to ensure that governmental resources for the removal of individuals are focused on high priority cases, including those involving a danger to national security or a risk to public safety,"" an administration official from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told CNN. The justification to not include DACA grantees is still unclear to Huerta, especially since the Obama administration fought to keep them from being deported. ""This particular undocumented youth population calls America home, is ready and willing to work hard, but what happens if they get sick? Their options are limited and expensive,"" Huerta said. As it stands, the existing welfare reform law requires immigrants to have legal status and wait five years before they can qualify for federal income-based benefits such as Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. That's why U.S. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham introduced a bill that would make legal immigrants and DACA grantees immediately eligible for health insurance. ""Although they pay taxes, more than 600,000 legal permanent residents are restricted from receiving federal health care benefits,"" the New Mexico Democrat said in a news release. ""This lack of access leads to more visits to emergency rooms, where immigrants are forced to pay as much as $1,200 to treat common ailments like the flu and upper respiratory infections."" Critics: Health care access would increase illegal immigration . Critics such as Media Director Ira Mehlman of the The Federation for American Immigration Reform argue that providing health care services would encourage more illegal immigration. ""County hospitals are overwhelmed with uninsured people, and they've been forced to come up with more money to accommodate these people -- largely because they've encouraged them to come in,"" Mehlman said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. Right now, the only other ways DACA grantees can receive health insurance is from their employer, being a spouse's dependent, going to a community clinic or purchasing it on their own outside the exchange, paying the entire premium. Huerta hopes the National Immigration Law Center's recommendation to allow DACA to take part in Obamacare will be taken into consideration. ""It makes financial and practical sense to include DACA grantees in the ACA,"" Huerta said. ""It would increase the pool that's eligible for exchanges by adding generally young, healthy immigrants, and that would decrease health insurance costs for all of us."" If done, it could help as many as 1.7 million immigrant youths eligible for DACA status that aren't fortunate enough to live in states such as New York or California. New York City to issue ID cards to undocumented residents . Many people are unaware of their eligibility for the California Medicaid welfare program and, according to a study by the UC Berkeley Labor Center, 125,000 more immigrant youths in California with deferred action status are eligible for the program. And an estimated 1 million undocumented Californians remain uninsured since the ACA went into effect this year and, according to a UCLA study, ""71% of uninsured immigrant youth have an existing need to access a doctor or specialist about their own health; however, 53% stated that they haven't seen a doctor for more than a year."" Murillo said she felt constant pressure to stay healthy before she found out about her Medi-Cal eligibility. ""Lack of health coverage has been a big problem for me. Whenever I got sick, my mom would have to make me home remedies to help me get better,"" Murillo said. While home remedies might provide some relief, it's still considered Band-Aid care, which means people are more likely to turn to the most expensive option -- the emergency room. The UCLA study also found that 74% of California's immigrant youths report they've received services from public safety-net programs, such as emergency Medi-Cal, public hospitals and community or county health clinics.","Administration official: DACA was never intended to provide federal assistance .

"Sen. Rand Paul castigated President Barack Obama on Friday for his use of executive action, arguing the President is an ""arrogant"" leader whose policies resemble those of an ""autocrat."" ""The resident acts like he's a king. He ignores the Constitution,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""He arrogantly says, 'If Congress will not act, then I must.' These are not the words of a great leader. These are the words that sound more like the exclamations of an autocrat."" At the beginning of the year, Obama declared 2014 as a ""year of action,"" vowing to pursue his agenda on his own if Congress gets bogged down in partisan gridlock. In July, for example, he signed an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Paul's remarks, which came before a social conservative audience at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, were laced with attacks against the administration. While the senator agrees with the President's decision to lead an airstrike campaign against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, he continued to blast Obama for not seeking authorization from Capitol Hill first. ""In the face of war, the President is just as arrogant,"" Paul said. ""Instead of coming to Congress, he illegally acts on his own."" The Obama administration has cited a 2001 measure passed by Congress to fight al Qaeda and the 2002 Iraq war authorization as legislation that grants him power to take action against the militant group. More broadly, Paul criticized what he described as a lack of ""virtue"" and ""tradition"" in the nation's capital. Saying America ""is in a full blown crisis --a spiritual crisis,"" Paul called for a ""revival"" of such values. Paul's speeches rarely weave in his faith, but the senator ticked off a number of talking points Friday that play well with social and evangelical audiences, including his stance against abortion and his call to end foreign aid to countries that target Christians. ""I think we must do something our world often tells us not to do: Seek God,"" he said, arguing the country needs to reclaim its constitutional roots, but not going too deep into specifics.

"Washington (CNN) -- Old mental health records for the chief suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks suggest Bruce Ivins should have been prevented from holding a job at a U.S. Army research facility in Maryland, according to a report from a panel of behavioral experts commissioned by the Department of Justice. ""The psychiatric records were quite eye-opening,"" said Gregory Saathoff, the lead author of the report. ""The criminal behaviors involved a strong component of revenge,"" he added, ""that he claimed he had engaged in as well as planned to engage in"" in documented interviews with psychiatrists dating back to the 1970s. Ivins was accused by the FBI of allegedly being behind the mailings of anthrax that killed five people in 2001. Ivins, who knew he was under suspicion, committed suicide in 2008 before any charges were filed against him. The report ""does support the Department of Justice's determination that he was responsible,"" including that he had the capacity, the opportunity and the motivation to carry out the attacks. His psychiatric records apparently were not reviewed in 1980 by the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases when it granted security clearances that led to his being hired as a government microbiologist, the report says. But it wasn't because of privacy law that his problems were not immediately brought to light. ""He had signed waivers prior to his employment that his records could be made available,"" Saathoff said, ""but to our knowledge those records were never accessed."" Authorities looking for a suspect in the anthrax mailings also missed the troubled picture of mental health. ""This information had been deemed confidential during Dr. Ivins' lifetime,"" Saathoff noted, ""accessible only to his medical providers, and off-limits to investigators"" looking into the deadly anthrax case. Moreover, based on its findings, the report says Ivins was able to omit and distort details of his mental health throughout his career at Fort Detrick, Maryland, ""in a manner that enabled him to evade real scrutiny."" The pattern continued through 2008, when ""he was displaying behaviors that were of great concern,"" Saathoff said, but were not acted upon by Ivins' supervisors. Outwardly, ""Ivins projected a persona of benign eccentricity,"" a summary says, but ""portrayed himself as a far more dangerous person"" in meetings with a psychiatrist about a year before he was hired, the summary says. The report, entitled ""The Amerithrax Case,"" was released Wednesday through the Research Strategies Network, a nonprofit think tank based in Charlottesville, Virginia. At a briefing for reporters in Washington, one of the co-authors, Ronald Schouten, a medical doctor with a specialty in psychiatry, said ""there've been vast improvements,"" in the process of checking someone's background for jobs in national security and critical materials. But, he said, when a person has received counseling for mental health issues, it's up to the provider to know what importance to place on disclosure of their analysis. Schouten said as part of a background check, ""if you speak to treating clinicians and say that this person's job involves national security issues, involves a clearance, involves working with dangerous agents, WMD (weapons of mass destruction), you'll get a different level of response."" The report includes a list of personnel security recommendations based on what it called the ""extraordinary"" anthrax case. The report, completed in August, took five months to prepare in response to a request by the U.S. Department of Justice. Probing into otherwise confidential medical records was authorized by a sealed order in 2009 from U.S. District Court chief Judge Royce Lamberth. The report had remained under seal until this month, and only a redacted version was revealed Wednesday. Censored details include information that could identify friends, co-workers and mental health professionals who encountered and counseled Ivins during his career. Last month, the National Academy of Sciences issued a report and concluded that using the available scientific evidence ""it is not possible to reach a definitive conclusion"" about the source of the anthrax used in the 2001 anthrax letter attacks. The panel said the anthrax used in mailings was the Ames strain Bacillus anthracis, and spores from those letters shared ""a number of genetic similarities"" with spores in Ivins' flask. But the findings say the FBI did not fully explore other possible explanations for those similarities. Last month, the National Academy of Sciences issued a report that supported the FBI's scientific basis linking Ivins to the form of anthrax used in the attacks. Wednesday's report noted ""Dr. Ivins acknowledged that he was the sole custodian of the ""RMR-1029"" flask that held the anthrax"" mailed to targets in the media and Congress. Postal workers who handled the contaminated letters were among the 22 people infected. There were five fatalities.","Scientist hired at Army research site without full background check .

"Washington (CNN) -- When the Founding Fathers decided to create a bicameral legislative branch, they were trying to make things difficult for the federal government to grab power from the people. What the Founding Fathers may not have foreseen was how much the House and the Senate would grow to dislike and distrust each other. Why is this important now? Democrats in the House may have to take the political risk of voting to pass the health care bill based on assurances from the Senate that the upper chamber will eventually modify the law to change some things House Democrats don't want. I live a bipartisan household. I am a creature of the House, having spent 15 years toiling as a Republican staffer in the lower chamber. My wife is a Senate girl, having spent about the same amount of time as a Republican staffer in the upper chamber. Talk about Mars and Venus. When you are working for the House majority, you worry less about the tactics of the minority and more about the workings of an inscrutable Senate. Former Speaker Tip O'Neill reportedly once said to a Democratic colleague: ""Remember, the House Republicans are merely the opposition. The Senate is the enemy."" Two examples come quickly to mind. Right after Bill Frist became majority leader in the Senate in 2003, President Bush and House Republicans were pushing for a tax cut of a certain size, which they thought would stimulate an economy that was faltering. To do so, both the House and Senate needed to pass a budget resolution that included that sizeable tax cut number. The House passed the budget, and all eyes were on the Senate majority leader, who was having some trouble convincing a few wayward senators to climb on board the tax cut train. Suddenly, a deal was struck, and the Senate passed the budget. But nobody in the House knew exactly what the deal was. Rumors started floating around that Frist had promised the few moderates who didn't like the high cost of the tax cut to only allow a tax cut of half the size being pushed by the president and by House Republicans to pass the Senate. The House Republicans were, to put it politely, outraged. They fulminated and fomented. They accused the new majority leader and the new budget chairman (Don Nickles) of treachery, of cowardice, and worse, of being squishes. And they spent the next six months trying to come up with a plan to screw the dastardly Senate. In October 2001, just after the September 11 terrorist attacks, a jittery congressional leadership went to the White House to meet with the president. At the early morning meeting, Sen. Tom Daschle divulged that his office had received a powdery substance that looked just like the anthrax that had been sent to news broadcasters in New York City. If it was the same anthrax, it could be deadly, especially if it got into the Capitol building air ducts. All four leaders agreed to close down the Capitol to protect the lives of the employees who worked there. Speaker Denny Hastert and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt dutifully told their House colleagues of the plan, and they shut down their side of the Capitol. When Daschle and Sen. Trent Lott went back to brief their colleagues about the plan, there was a rebellion. Sen John McCain was especially obstinate, saying basically that closing the Capitol was the same as surrendering to terrorists. Without telling Hastert and Gephardt, the Senate announced that it was staying open. The headline in the New York Post the next morning blared ""WIMPS,"" calling the speaker and the House a bunch of cowards for trying to protect their staff from an anthrax attack. I never had so much fun in my life working with my House Democratic counterparts launching a furious counterattack in the media against the upper chamber. My former boss, Speaker Hastert, who had nothing but disdain for the Senate, used to call senators those ""prancing ponies who all wanted to be president."" And the Senate, from what my wife tells me, holds the House in similarly minimal high regard. The question that now roils the House is: Can they trust the Senate? Could they trust them when the House, during President Bill Clinton's first term, passed a politically very dangerous BTU tax, a new tax based on energy consumption? Dozens of vulnerable Democrats voted for the president's budget that included that tax, only to see it stripped by the Senate. The answer, sadly, is no. The Senate is going to do what it is going to do. It is going to get as much done as it can get done, with the limitations it has under its rules. And if it sees a chance to stick it to the House, believe me, it will. The difference between the House and the Senate is this: Members of the House who have power and positions of authority have already put in the time and energy to be House people. Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner have no interest in moving up to the Senate. They are going to fight for the prerogatives of their colleagues and of their institution. Most senators still believe, in the back of the their minds, they will be or should be president. They are always looking for ways to play to the cameras and increase their national prominence. Aside from the egos and the ambition of those in the upper body, there are also the rules. The Senate rules give more power to individual senators and more power to the minority. That tradition has been around for a long time, so that the Senate doesn't just become a smaller version of the House. It was created to give states, especially in less populous regions, an ability to protect themselves from the demands of the more populous regions of the country. It is on big bills, like the health care reform legislation now being considered by the House and the Senate, where the stresses between the House and the Senate become more pronounced. House members are now asking themselves: Can we trust the Senate? If we pass their bill, will they pass ours? If we go out on a limb for them, will they change their Senate rules for us? Well, as President Ronald Reagan used to say about the old Soviet Union: Trust. But verify. Which really means don't trust them at all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Feehery.","Health bill passage may require House Democrats to trust Senate Democrats .

"Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, was sentenced to life in prison Tuesday, said Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan. In March, he was found guilty of helping al Qaeda terrorists conspire to kill Americans and providing material support to terrorists. ""Justice has been served,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. ""This outcome ensures that Sulaiman Abu (Ghaith), a senior member of al Qaeda and an associate of Usama bin Laden, will never again set foot outside a prison cell."" The life term was imposed by U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. Authorities described Abu Ghaith as bin Laden's ""propaganda minister"" and the ""face and voice of al Qaeda in the days and weeks after the 9/11 attacks."" At his trial, federal prosecutors said Abu Ghaith, a Kuwaiti cleric, played a crucial role as the organization's principal mouthpiece and recruiter, helping ""restore al Qaeda's trove of new terrorists"" as deadly missions turned its members into martyrs. ""He was more than just Usama bin Laden's propaganda minister. Within hours after the devastating 9/11 attacks, Abu Ghayth was using his position in al Qaeda's homicidal hierarchy to persuade others to pledge themselves to al Qaeda in the cause of murdering more Americans,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a prepared statement after the guilty verdict was announced. Abu Ghaith, 48, was flown to the United States a year ago from Jordan and charged with conspiring to kill Americans. The government did not allege that he served an operational function or had a direct hand in carrying out the attacks. Bharara said at the time of Abu Ghaith's conviction: ""Like the others who have faced terrorism charges in Manhattan's federal courthouse before him, Abu Ghayth received a fair trial, after which a unanimous jury rendered its verdict, justly holding him accountable for his crimes. We hope this verdict brings some small measure of comfort to the families of the victims of al Qaeda's murderous designs."" In a statement, George Venizelos, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York field office, likened Abu Ghaith to ""a consigliere for the mob or the chief of staff to a corrupt foreign leader"" and said he was a ""spokesman, confidant and senior adviser"" to bin Laden's organization. Abu Ghaith ""looked to better al Qaeda's reputation at every turn, offering advice and counsel to the organization's senior leadership. He encouraged others to abandon the true tenets of their faith, swearing bayat to the twisted ideology of al Qaeda,"" Venizelos said, using the Islamic word for allegiance. The trial was held blocks from the site of Manhattan's World Trade Center, and several survivors of the attacks and family members of victims attended. Bin Laden spiritual adviser . Abu Ghaith testified that he never joined the ranks of al Qaeda and assisted bin Laden only as a speaker on spiritual topics. Known in the Persian Gulf region as a religious scholar and fiery orator, Abu Ghaith met the al Qaeda leader in Afghanistan in June 2001, according to testimony. He denied advance knowledge of the 9/11 attacks but said he'd heard talk that ""something big"" was about to happen. He moved his family from Afghanistan to Kuwait days before the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Just after the attacks, the al Qaeda leader summoned Abu Ghaith to his remote mountain hiding place and asked him to help ""deliver a message to the world"" on the organization's behalf, the religious scholar testified. After his arrest last year in Jordan, activists and legislators sparred over where to try Abu Ghaith, with some calling for the case to be heard in a military courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Instead, the trial took place amid extra security measures at the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The jury watched videos produced after the meeting with the al Qaeda leader, of Abu Ghaith making passionate calls for further attacks on Americans, flanked by bin Laden on one side and an AK-47 rifle on the other. He called for fellow Muslims to ""terrorize the infidels"" and vowed the ""storm of airplanes will not abate,"" a phrase he said on the stand was given to him in ""bullet points"" provided by bin Laden for the speeches. Abu Ghaith's attorney, Stan Cohen, accused prosecutors of using 9/11 imagery in lieu of evidence of his client's guilt and told the jurors that he counted 172 references to bin Laden and 9/11 in the first half of the prosecution's closing argument. ""It was intended to sweep you away in anguish and pain and to ask for retaliation. It was intended to make you look away from the evidence,"" Cohen told the panel. He said none of the government's witnesses conclusively tied his client to terrorism-related activities, including a terrorism specialist with the FBI and two cooperating former al Qaeda members.","Sulaiman Abu Ghaith gets a life sentence for conspiring to kill Americans, supporting terrorists .

"Washington (CNN) -- Using the available scientific evidence ""it is not possible to reach a definitive conclusion"" about the source of the anthrax used in the 2001 anthrax letter attacks which killed five people, according to a report issued Tuesday by the National Academy of Sciences. The findings come two and a half years after the FBI said Army microbiologist Bruce Ivins was allegedly behind the anthrax mailings, and the spores could be genetically traced to a flask labeled RMR-1029 in his lab. The scientific panel said the anthrax used in mailings to news organizations and members of Congress was the Ames strain Bacillus anthracis, and spores from those letters shared ""a number of genetic similarities"" with spores in Ivins' flask. But the findings say the FBI did not fully explore other possible explanations for those similarities. Ivins knew he was under suspicion by the FBI and committed suicide in July 2008 before any charges were filed against him. Ivins was involved in anthrax vaccine research at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland. Paul Kemp, a lawyer who represented Ivins, said that since August 2008, the Justice Department has maintained it had a ""smoking gun"" in the case against Ivins, citing the flask. ""Their smoking gun just turned into smoke and mirrors,"" Kemp said of the report. ""They said they had a smoking gun that would have convicted him (Ivins) in court and this report shows they didn't."" Kemp later added: ""Over 200 people had access to the anthrax that came out of that flask."" In response to the report, the FBI said, while the scientific investigation could not pinpoint the source of the anthrax, it helped its agents and the Justice Department to focus resources and conclude that Ivins was behind the attacks. ""Ultimately, the late Dr. Bruce Ivins was determined to be the perpetrator of the deadly mailings. The FBI and Department of Justice were preparing for prosecution at the time of Dr. Ivin's death,"" the FBI said. Ivins maintained his innocence up until his death, Kemp said, adding that Tuesday's report ""just casts doubts"" on the FBI's conclusion that his former client was responsible. The FBI praised the report for highlighting the value of what the FBI called ""microbial forensics,"" which it said ""proved significant"" in solving the case. ""Although there have been great strides in forensic science over the years, rarely does science alone solve an investigation. The scientific findings in this case provided investigators with valuable investigative leads that led to the identification of the late Dr. Bruce Ivins as the perpetrator of the anthrax attacks,"" the FBI said. Throughout the anthrax probe, investigators grappled with questions about how much experience the perpetrator would have needed to make the anthrax and whether the material was ""weaponized"" with a silicon dispersant to allow it to float through the air, thus making it more likely the deadly spores would be inhaled. The National Academy of Sciences panel said it found ""no scientific basis on which to accurately estimate the amount of time or the specific skill set needed to prepare the spore material contained in the letters."" The panel said the time required to make the anthrax could range from two to three days to several months depending on the methods used to make the anthrax. The group said it found no evidence the perpetrator intentionally added silicon-based dispersants to increase the flow of spores in the air. The panel said silicon was not detected on the outside of the spores which would be necessary as a dispersant. Silicon was found only inside the spores. The FBI conducted a security review of the academy's draft report in October 2010. The FBI subsequently asked to provide the panel some additional information. That material included an analysis of environmental samples taken from ""an undisclosed overseas site at which a terrorist group's anthrax program was allegedly located."" Investigators looked at the overseas site as part of the anthrax letters investigation. The Academy of Sciences report said samples from the site had inconsistent evidence of Ames strain B anthracis and further review was recommended. The FBI also told the panel an analysis was done on human remains identified as belonging to 9/11 hijackers from United flight 93 which crashed in Pennsylvania. One test came up positive for anthrax but all other results were negative. Remains from the other 9/11 flights were not tested for anthrax. The National Academy of Sciences report offers no opinion on Ivins' guilt or innocence. It looks only at the scientific underpinnings of the FBI's investigation. The scientists also did not have access to classified information. The FBI asked the National Academy of Sciences to conduct an independent review of the science used in its investigation. That review began in 2009. The FBI's investigation of the anthrax attacks was closed in February 2010 and some critics have said the bureau should have delayed that move until the release of the National Academy of Sciences report. Rep. Rush Holt, a Democrat from New Jersey who had criticized the FBI investigation, said he's re-introducing legislation calling for a 9/11 style commission to look into the anthrax letter attacks. ""It would take a credulous person to believe the circumstantial evidence that the FBI used to draw its conclusions with such certainty,"" Holt said in a press release. ""The FBI has not proiven to me that this is an open and shut case."" The anthrax letters were mailed from New Jersey, the state Holt represents. Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said the report ""shows that the science is not necessarily a slam dunk."" Grassley called for an independent review of the FBI's investigation. At one time the FBI used Ivins as one of its scientific consultants in the anthrax investigation. After clues led investigators to focus on Ivins, the FBI performed surveillance on him, executed search warrants and studied lab records showing he had spent late hours alone in his lab prior to the time the anthrax letters were mailed. After his death, Justice Department and FBI officials released numerous documents from the investigation and said they believed Ivins bore sole responsibility for the attacks. The anthrax-laced letters were mailed in fall 2001 -- shortly after the 9/11 terror attacks -- to then NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw, the New York Post, Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Tom Daschle, who was the Senate Majority Leader at the time. Five people died from inhalation anthrax which officials say was caused by contaminated mail. Two of those people were Washington area postal workers Joseph Curseen Jr. and Thomas Morris Jr. The other victims were Bob Stevens, a photo editor at American Media, Inc. in Boca Raton, Florida; Kathy Nguyen, a New York City hospital worker; and Ottilie Lundgren, an Oxford, Connecticut, widow. Seventeen other people became sick from either inhaling anthrax or skin exposure.","NEW: Legislators call for independent review of the FBI's investigation .

"When teenage girls check out Seventeen magazine, they'll be getting the complete picture -- no ifs, ands or Photoshopped butts about it. That's the pledge the magazine's staff made in its latest edition, after a push led by a Maine 14-year-old to combat the practice of tweaking pictures and picking models whose appearance give teens an unrealistic perspective on what is beautiful. ""We vow to ... never change girls' body or face shapes. (Never have, never will),"" the magazine states as part of its ""Body Peace Treaty"" from its August edition, a copy of which CNN obtained Thursday. The treaty and accompanying note by editor-in-chief Ann Shoket promise that Seventeen will ""celebrate every kind of beauty"" and feature ""real girls and models who are healthy,"" while vouching that the magazine always has done just that. But the more than 84,000 people who signed a Change.org petition, started by teenager Julia Bluhm, clearly believed Seventeen and other publications didn't always present the full, unvarnished truth. ""Those 'pretty women' that we see in magazines are fake,"" the petition said, in requesting ""one unaltered -- real -- photo spread per month."" ""They're often Photoshopped, air-brushed, edited to look thinner and to appear like they have perfect skin. A girl you see in a magazine probably looks a lot different in real life."" Retouching photographs is nothing new -- especially in magazines and, increasingly, on the Internet. Adobe Photoshop and other digital image manipulation programs are widely employed by professionals and everyday users. The petition claims that disseminating such altered images to impressionable teens can pose a real danger, helping to spawn a culture that touts unrealistic beauty and contributes to eating disorders, extreme dieting, depression and more. On YouTube, teens ask the world: Am I ugly? ""I know how it affects girls and ... my friends,"" Julia told CNN in May, shortly after meeting with Shoket and presenting the signatures to her. ""We don't realize it sometimes when we're just looking at the magazine and having fun. It can lower self-esteem."" But not all teenage girls think retouching photographs is a problem. Alexis Jones of Alpharetta, Georgia, said Thursday she'd worry that, if magazines portrayed young women who were overweight or had acne as being beautiful, some girls may think it's OK to live an unhealthy lifestyle. In fact, she feels making models' bodies thinner and their skin clearer can serve as positive motivation for people to take better care of themselves. ""Some people use that ideal image as motivation to get fit, eat healthy and stuff, while some use it as a crutch,"" said the 18-year-old, a rising freshman at Georgia State University. ""You just have to be strong-minded."" In addition to going ""more public"" in its commitment, Seventeen states in its latest edition it is partnering with the National Eating Disorders Association and the Commission for Positive Images of Women and Girls. The magazine's treaty also vows it will ""be totally upfront about what goes into our photo shoots"" and it understands that, ""regardless of clothing size, being healthy is about honoring your natural shape."" ""We vow to ... give you the confidence to walk into any room and own it. Say bye-bye to those nagging insecurities that you're not good enough or pretty enough."" Even as she pushed another petition urging Teen Vogue to make a similar public pledge, Julia celebrated the proposals made by Seventeen. ""'Seventeen' listened!"" she said in an update of her online petition. ""They're saying they won't use Photoshop to digitally alter their models! This is a huge victory, and I'm so unbelievably happy."" The magazine said that it will continue make small changes to photos, like erasing a stray hair or changing background colors, even as it insists it still won't make big changes to a person's body or face. Yet by not taking any responsibility for having presented anything but ""authentic"" beauty in the past, the magazine ""doesn't really address (the) criticism"" from many that it hasn't always lived by those rules, said former model Jenna Sauers. ""Seventeen essentially says that it's never had any issues with the way it's Photoshopped ... celebrities and models but that, just to be on the safe side, it will continue not altering the bodies of the people photographed,"" said Sauers, a contributor to the female-focused, commentary-driven online magazine Jezebel.com. ""It seems like 84,000 people who signed that petition seem to be of the opinion that there were some issues."" Sauers said photo-editing tools have ""made it incredibly easy to alter all kinds of things about image including body shape, size, skin color, skin tone, to erase wrinkles. And sometimes the effects are downright creepy."" The practice is widely used, and accepted, in the fashion and magazine industry -- such that many people now almost assume that most any image of a beautiful person is somehow doctored, Sauers told CNN. ""We've gotten used to the idea over the past 10 years or so that every single image we see in a magazine, particularly in women's magazines, is going to be an altered, hyper-real, impossible idealized version of how that person actually looks,"" she said. Empowering young girls online . ""For young girls, that's not a healthy visual culture to be growing up in."" New York-based celebrity publicist Marvet Britto said on HLN's ""Evening Express"" that magazine editors generally are ""not selling reality, they're selling where the consumer desires to be."" ""As much as we would like to think that (media would show) a more diverse array of the American public to young girls, that's simply not going to happen,"" Britto said, asserting you'll find ""pretty much the same type of individual"" on covers of magazines such as Seventeen. Emma Stydahar -- a teen activist affiliated with Spark, a movement devoted to ending ""the sexualization of women and girls in media"" for whom Bluhm has blogged -- acknowledged on HLN that altered images are widespread and do negatively affect girls. Still, she expressed excitement about Seventeen's new public declaration and anticipation that it will spur other publishers to follow suit. And if it doesn't, she promised, young women such as she and Julia Bluhme will keep pushing to affect change. ""I definitely see that in the future,"" Stydahar said. ""I know that, myself personally and my co-workers at Spark will not change until this capitalization off of young woman's body image stops.""

"Can a patient be rejected for a kidney transplant based on a developmental disability? A New Jersey mother alleges in her blog that this happened to her 3-year-old daughter, and it has sparked an Internet uproar. Whether a person with a mental disability qualifies for an organ transplant is a decision made on a case-by-case basis, based on that patient's health, experts say. On Thursday, Chrissy Rivera wrote in the blog wolfhirschhorn.org about her latest doctor's visit concerning her daughter, Amelia. Rivera writes in the blog that Amelia was ruled out from receiving a kidney transplant because of her developmental disability. The blog post went viral and inspired an online petition on Change.org that had collected more than 26,000 signatures by 1 p.m ET Wednesday. It's not possible to confirm Rivera's story with the hospital because of privacy protection laws.  CNN contacted Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, but the hospital said it had no comment other than a statement posted on Facebook. Amelia, nicknamed Mia, has the genetic disorder Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, which delays growth, development and intellectual abilities. People with this syndrome have unusual physical features such as dry skin, curvature of the spine, dental problems, cleft palate or cleft lip, and weak muscle tone that can cause short stature, according to the National Institutes of Health. Depending on the type of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, the median life expectancy is no higher than 34 years, according to a 2001 study published in the Journal of Medical Genetics. Amelia has been a patient at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia almost all her life, said her father, Joe Rivera. But her kidneys are failing, according to the Riveras.  Her nephrologist estimated she has six months to one year before needing a transplant, the girl's parents said. In the blog entry, Chrissy Rivera detailed a doctor's visit on January 10. She wrote that a doctor on the transplant team and a social worker said that Amelia could not be a candidate for kidney transplant ""because of her mental delays."" The doctor warned that the medications Amelia has to take after a transplant are very dangerous and could cause seizures and brain damage, the blog post said.  According to Rivera, she was told that it was a different case for Amelia compared with other children, because ""she is already brain damaged and mentally retarded."" Amelia's dad was also in the room during the conversation. ""I don't know how I didn't jump across the table,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview.  ""I was more in shock. I felt like I was frozen."" Rivera said they did not ask that Amelia be placed on the transplant waiting list, which has 90,150 candidates seeking kidney transplants.  The Riveras wanted to see whether they or other volunteers could be a donor match for her. Children even as young as Amelia can receive adult organs -- these body parts can be sliced in a way to fit inside a child's body. Amelia's parents had not been tested to see whether they matched yet. ""We were going into the meeting thinking we're going to be informed on the process,"" Rivera said.  ""Instead he (the doctor) gives us a paper that said she's mentally retarded so she doesn't qualify."" His wife ended her blog post urging readers to share Amelia's story.  ""We are in the year 2012 and my child still does not have the right to live, the right to a transplant, because she is developmentally delayed,"" Rivera wrote. Without knowing the child's medical information, it's impossible to know whether there were other factors that shaped the doctor's recommendation regarding Amelia's transplant. On its Facebook page, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia stated that, ""We do not disqualify potential transplant candidates on the basis of intellectual abilities. We have transplanted many children with a wide range of disabilities, including physical and mental disabilities."" In response to the barrage of comments on its Facebook page, the hospital wrote: ""We're listening. We hear your concerns and take seriously your posts, emails and phone calls."" During a discussion on CNN Tuesday, former prosecutor Seema Iyer said, ""I would love to hear from the hospital, because these hospitals are constantly in fear of being sued,"" and said that there could be other issues in this case. Rivera said someone from the hospital called Sunday about scheduling another appointment. ""We never said anything about CHOP,"" he said.  ""Some of the people ranting about Facebook, we haven't said one bad thing. We love CHOP.  We want things to be fixed."" There are no national guidelines over transplants involving mentally disabled patients.  The United Network for Organ Sharing, the private, nonprofit organization that manages the nation's organ transplant system, does not have rules about what to do in cases of patients with mental disabilities. Doctors can refuse to consider a patient for an organ transplant if there is another illness or complications such as a severe infection or cancer that is likely to limit the life span. Mental disabilities should not factor into the decision making for transplants, so long as the patient has strong support from family and caregivers who would ensure that the required medications and care is given, said Dr. Raul de Velasco, the clinical ethics program director at the University of Miami. ""The mental disability should not be the reason why you should not receive a kidney,"" said de Velasco. The decision should come down to ""a medical problem, not the value of the life of a mentally disabled person."" The issue of developmental delay is a difficult one for transplant doctors. ""It's such an unpredictable area; there's not a lot of info known,"" said Dr. George Mazariegos, the chief of pediatric transplantation at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, about various developmental disabilities. ""Therefore these decisions are usually individualized, based on the patient's conditions, their absolute need for transplant and other aspects of the patient's condition."" All transplant recipients have to take immune-suppressing medication to make sure there is no rejection of the new organ. ""Because many individuals with disabilities have a guardian or health care provider making sure they're getting to their appointments, the compliance is not an issue,"" said Marilee Martens, program director of Nisonger Center at The Ohio State University. Martens wrote a 2006 report examining the outcome of patients with developmental delays who received kidney transplants.  The report published in Pediatric Transplantation concluded that the one-year patient survival rate was 100% and the three-year outcome was 90%. In Amelia's case, it's difficult to draw any conclusions because, ""all we know is what the mom reported hearing. We don't know what the physician stated,"" she said. On the flip side, patients who have mental disabilities or neurological delays can qualify to be live organ donors after undergoing screening processes and consent from the family. Joe Rivera said over the past few days, they've heard from other parents of children with developmental disabilities, who say they were excluded from transplants. All kids deserve a chance, he said.","New Jersey mom wrote that a doctor rejected transplant based on ""mental delays""

"Paris, we can all agree, has a lot going for it. It has splendid museums, grand avenues, a famous pointy tower and thousands of cafes where you can order a minuscule coffee for a fairly large amount of money. But Lyon is a supremely qualified rival. In Lyon, a hearty serving of tradition . Smaller it may be, but France's second city has a sophistication that makes it a hugely intriguing option for visitors. While the following suggestions may cause rioting (or, at least, mild shrugs of indifference) along the Champs-Elysees, there are a number of ways Lyon outshines the French capital. Eight, in fact. 1. Wine . Just about everyone in France loves wine. But in contrast to Paris -- which sips anything fruity put in front of it, but doesn't produce anything of its own -- Lyon brings a bottle to the party. A lot of bottles. Lyon is the gateway to the Beaujolais viticultural region, which fans out immediately to the northwest. From Lyon, you can explore these whispering vineyards yourself. Or you can take the easy route and make a few wise purchases in the excellent wine shops around the city. Cave Chromatique does flavorsome reds and whites, while La Cave des Vins Magnifiques is hardly short on confidence when it comes to the contents of its stock list. 2. Notre Dames . Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral is an inimitable French icon, especially if you like long lines and pigeons. Lyon's Notre Dame -- the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourviere -- is, simply, a more beautiful church. A young maiden (built 1872-1884) compared with Paris's grande dame (built 1163-1345), she sits prettily atop the city's main hill, offering views down to the riverside streets below, and, on clear days, across to the snowcaps of the Alps. 3. Outdoor music . Lyon knows how to put on a summer extravaganza. The Nuits de Fourviere festival sees 60 or so shows -- rock, classical music, drama -- stretched across the warm evenings of June and July. Alumni of this wide showcase include Lou Reed, Bjork and Sting. The 2014 lineup includes French pop stalwarts Phoenix and U.S. indie veterans the Pixies. Better than any band, though, is a setting that Paris can't match. The French capital may have modern venues befitting its size and status, but it can't dance the night away as if Caesar Augustus were still in the posh seats. The majority of the Nuits de Fourviere performances take place amid the sturdy tiers of Lyon's main Roman amphitheater, which dates to 15 B.C. 4. Cinematic history . Paris has been in many movies. ""Moulin Rouge."" ""Amelie."" ""Midnight in Paris."" But Lyon pretty much invented the movies. Or, at least, two of its most famous sons did. Auguste and Louis Lumiere are credited with creating the first film camera (the cinematograph) in 1892. You can pay tribute to their vision at Lyon's Institut Lumiere, with its museum and cinema. 5. Food . Paris is very good at cuisine. It's just that Lyon believes it's better. It may well be. Its restaurants include L'Auberge du Pont de Collonges, a fabled temple of Gallic gastronomy which has three Michelin stars. It's overseen by French uber-chef Paul Bocuse, who is now 88, but still a master at his signature truffle soup. Then there's La Mere Brazier, which exists under the gaze of Mathieu Viannay. The restaurant has two Michelin stars, but Viannay is only 46, so can be excused his shortfall. 6. Parks . Paris doesn't have a large central green space -- unless you count the Jardins des Tuileries, which are predominantly surfaced in gravel, and are therefore white. But Lyon has the Parc de la Tete d'Or, which -- with its 117 hectares of grass and trees -- cozies up to the Rhone in the sixth arrondissement. Here, you can go boating on the lake, cycle along winding pathways, or simply lie in the shade and remark on the fact that this metropolitan lung's name -- Park of the Golden Head -- sounds a bit silly in English. 7. Roman history . In numbers, this is basically a tie. Julius Caesar stomped his sandals into the fledgling Paris in 52 B.C.; Lyon had its first date with expansionist toga-wearing proto-Italians when it was founded as Lugdunum a decade later in 43 B.C. But Lyon was the more important city under Roman rule -- a teacher's pet that became Rome's head boy in ancient Gaul. This still shows. Lyon's Roman structures are almost as impressive today as they were in the days of the gladiators -- especially the remnants of its public baths and the giant amphitheater on Fourviere hill at the Gallo-Roman Museum. 8. Rivers . Why did the Romans plonk Lugdunum onto the map where they did? Because the place was ideal for a settlement. West of the Alps, it was a decent stop-off point halfway up France and not too far from the mother city. But above that, because it had -- and has -- two rivers. The Rhone, which is so long that it has to travel from Switzerland, curves through the center of Lyon. So does the Saone. The two meet in the aptly titled district of Confluence. Paris, by contrast, has just one river, the Seine. Ah, c'est dommage.","Lyon is France's ""second city"" but it leads the way in a number of cultural categories .
Paris has Notre Dame but Lyon's Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourviere is more beautiful .
Paris has one river; Lyon has two .

"Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is breaking with many in his party by urging the White House to give Congress more time to reach an immigration reform agreement.  He wants President Barack Obama to hold off using his executive authority to order major immigration changes, which the President is set to announce Thursday. ""I just wish he wouldn't do it. I really don't. I just think we ought to work through this process and, with the new elections and the results of the elections, we ought to try in January to see if we can find a pathway to get something accomplished,"" the West Virginia centrist said Tuesday. Manchin, who reliably works across the aisle, is concerned Obama's actions will offend Republicans and make it politically much harder for the two parties to agree to broader reforms that still will be needed to fully fix the broken immigration system. He said he would like to see House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, bring up a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate and put it to a vote, something Boehner has refused to do citing a variety of concerns with the bill. ""Let's see what everyone intends to do,"" he said.  ""I would think the Republicans will have observed and hopefully learned the formula we used before didn't work so I hope they wouldn't repeat it."" Manchin's concerns are in contrast to the views of many congressional Democrats who are sighing relief that the President has decided finally to go around the gridlocked Congress to help millions of immigrants living in the country illegally. However, two other moderate Democrats asked by CNN about the issue echoed Manchin's views. When asked whether she thought the President should issue the executive orders, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota said ""I think, as I've said, it's better to give Congress time to work on a bill."" And Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, who was just elected to a leadership position in the Democratic caucus, said, ""It would be great to get the House to take up the bill that passed the Senate.  That would be a solution to the problem."" Asked whether he would prefer the President not do it by executive authority, he replied, ""I would prefer that Congress act, yes.""","Sen.

"Carolina Panthers star defensive end Greg Hardy, who has been granted a new trial this fall after a domestic violence conviction in July, has taken a voluntary leave with pay until his legal matters are resolved, the team announced Wednesday. ""We understand Greg's decision,"" Panthers general manager Dave Gettleman told reporters. ""And given the circumstances, it's very important that he concentrate on his legal issues. We believe this is the right course of action at this time for both Greg and the Carolina Panthers."" Authorities say Hardy in May choked his then-girlfriend, threw her around, dragged her by her hair and threatened to kill her. He was sentenced in July to 18 months of probation and a 60-day suspended sentence for the misdemeanors with which he was charged. The 6-foot-4, 275 pound defensive end says he is innocent and has appealed a guilty verdict rendered by a Mecklenburg County judge in North Carolina. He was granted a jury trial that is scheduled for mid-November. ""I understand that I need to step away from football right now and take care of this legal matter. I am entitled to due process and my day in court, and that's where my focus should be,"" Hardy said in a statement released by the team. ""I appreciate the Panthers for giving me this opportunity and look forward to being back with my teammates as soon as possible. "" Gettleman said that Hardy will be placed on the NFL's exempt/commissioner's permission list, which allows in special circumstances for players to be paid while on leave.  He can still use the team's facilities but cannot attend practice. Peterson won't play until legal matters resolved . The players' union said it worked with the league, the Carolina Panthers and Hardy on the matter. ""We support this decision and hope the best for him and his family,"" the NFL Players Association said in a written statement. Hardy, who led the team last season with 15 sacks and was a Pro Bowl selection, missed Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions after the team placed on the inactive list.

"Former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pennsylvania, said this week that the growing threat towards American religious freedom by the government could lead to ""Christian persecution,"" similar to how the oppression of Jews and Christians evolved over time under Nazi Germany. Arguing that the rise of the Nazi regime happened in a stable country where it was not expected, Santorum said that a similar situation could occur in the United States where, according to Santorum, religious liberties are ""under direct assault"" for the first time in history. ""Germany, prior to the Nazis getting there, was a very religious country,"" Santorum said in an interview with the Christian Post. ""It was a Christian country. It was a very sophisticated country."" ""The idea that you can have this kind of persecution take place over a period of ten years -- where you go from Christians -- Jews, obviously, but also Christians -- being not just persecuted but put to death -- was unfathomable,"" he said. ""It was unfathomable to them that (in) a country like this, this could happen. Same thing here."" While the former presidential candidate did acknowledge that persecution in America is ""fairly mild"" compared to what's going on in other parts of the world, he warned that it is still dangerous because ""it's something that grows over time."" ""It starts in a gradual erosion,"" Santorum said. ""We're not in a dire situation right now, but that doesn't mean you can't get there. I would argue that there's a certainty that we will get there if we don't push back and defend our liberties."" ""If we don't nip it here, then things get a lot worse,"" he continued. Asked why such attacks on religious liberties exist in America, Santorum said it is mostly a result of government overreach. ""The government wants to tell you how to live your life,"" Santorum said, citing abortion and same-sex marriage issues. ""You either conform to what the government says you have to believe in, or you're going to lose certain privileges."" Santorum discussed the topic as part of an interview about his new film, titled ""One Generation Away,"" which is produced by a movie production company run by Santorum called EchoLight Cinemas. The film, Santorum says, highlights where religious persecution comes from, what it is about and why it is a danger to society.","Ex-Pennsylvania Sen.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- [Breaking news update 9:22 a.m. ET] . ""Django Unchained"" actress Daniele Watts said on CNN Monday that she refused to give a Los Angeles Police Officer her identification when he asked for it because, ""I believe in America and what it stands for."" Police said they were responding to calls from witnesses who said Watts and her boyfriend were involved in a ""sexual act"" in a public place in their car. Legal experts say the officer did have the right to request identification if he suspected illegal behavior. [Story previously published Sunday 4:33 p.m. ET] . ""Django Unchained"" actress Daniele Watts says Los Angeles police allegedly detained her because they thought she was a prostitute. Watts, who is African-American, and her white boyfriend accuse police of racism for questioning them after they were seen showing affection in public. An LAPD spokesman told CNN Sunday that officers from its North Hollywood precinct were responding to a citizen complaint. ""There was an indication on the radio call that a male white and female black were involved in a sexual act inside a Mercedes with the vehicle door open,"" Officer Sally Madera said. Her boyfriend -- Brian James Lucas but better known as celebrity chef Cheffy Be*Live -- wrote in a Facebook post that police ""saw a tatted RAWKer white boy and a hot bootie shorted black girl and thought we were a HO (prostitute) & a TRICK (client)."" ""Two people were briefly detained, but it was revealed no crime had been committed,"" Medera said. The man was not handcuffed, but the woman was, according to the couple. The alleged racial-profiling incident happened on a sidewalk near the gate of the CBS Studio Center in Studio City on Thursday. The neighborhood is an upscale area and is home to many celebrities, including George Clooney, Miley Cyrus and Steve Martin. The couple posted a short video clip and several photos showing Watts in handcuffs talking to police. One image shows a cut on her wrist, which she said was caused by the tight handcuffs. Watts, who acts in the FX show ""Partners,"" said the officers ""accosted me and forced me into handcuffs"" after she refused ""to agree that I had done something wrong by showing affection, fully clothed, in a public place."" Lucas said when an officer asked for their identifications, he showed his that but Watts refused ""to give it because they had no right to do so."" ""So they handcuffed her and threw her roughly into the back of the cop car until they could figure out who she was,"" he wrote. ""In the process of handcuffing her, they cut her wrist, which was truly NOT COOL!!!"" She was released ""quite quickly when they realized we were right outside CBS and that she was a celebrity and I was a celeb chef,"" Lucas wrote. ""Before they figured out who she was they were threatening calling an ambulance and drugging her for being psychologically unstable, SO NOT COOL WHATSOEVER! "" Watts and Lucas said they initially decided to forget about the incident, but then they decided they needed to speak up. ""We still forgive, love and bless them ... just not putting up with this for our own freedom and heart space,"" Lucas wrote. The couple has contacted lawyers, the ACLU and the NAACP, he said. ""Our publicist has us in contact with media about it, too, and we're supposed to hear back."" Watts, a native of Atlanta, made her feature film debut in 2012 as Coco in the Oscar-nominated ""Django Unchained."" Her biggest television role is on ""Partners,"" in which she plays Martin Lawrence's daughter.

"Wichita, Kansas (CNN) -- At a table in Caffe Moderne, a coffee bar in downtown Wichita, sat a couple of young Kansans sipping coffee and working away on Macbook Pros. Terms like ""content management systems"" and ""web integration"" floated in the air as Clint Brauer taught a local about his business. Thirteen years ago, Brauer couldn't wait to get out of the Sunflower State. ""I just didn't see the opportunities in Kansas,"" he said. ""I grew up in a small town outside of Wichita, went to Kansas State ... and so I moved to the West Coast to get into high tech."" Brauer traveled from the prairie to the Hollywood Hills and spent his 20s living the kind of life he'd fantasized about while growing up in the small town of Haven.   ""It was a really exciting time. Life was about work."" Brauer worked, made a career in consulting, and became the managing editor of Cyberread, an e-book company. The coasts have always held a great deal of appeal for techies. Los Angeles and San Francisco, California, and New York and Washington are hubs for the young and cyber-savvy.  100 best places to live  A generation of young workers flocked there at the turn of the millennium, drawn by job opportunities and the fast-paced lifestyle that the big cities provide. But the priorities of a 30-year-old can be dramatically different from those of a 20-something.   ""I started realizing that while I loved what I did, I wanted more balance. My goal wasn't to become the CEO of a Fortune 500 company anymore but to have a better quality of life."" A change was coming for Brauer, and fortunately the Web would provide.  ""I'm OK that I don't have three different Cuban restaurants to choose from,"" he jokes. ""Some folks couldn't deal with it, but I like going out to the country, going out to the lake, and enjoying the open skies.""  Not surprisingly, salaries in the heartland's Silicon Prairie are generally lower than California's Silicon Valley or New York's Silicon Alley.   The average salary for software engineers in New York City is $97,370; in California, it's $109,000. In Kansas, the average salary for the job is $85,000, according to federal stats. But if you factor in the Midwest's dramatically lower cost of living, the possible benefits become clear.   ""As high technology has become more interwoven with everything in our lives, there are bits and pieces of these industries in virtually every city,"" said Mark Vitner, an economist with Wells Fargo. ""We're getting to the point now that the jobs are spreading out across the country from Silicon Valley and New York."" The next Silicon Valley? It may be New York . Midwestern tech is coming into its own. Jeff Slobotski produces an event called Big Omaha that includes more than 500 of the region's workers from Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas and Iowa. The annual event just took place in May.  ""We've got a real healthy and growing community,"" said Slobotski, innovation director at the AIM Institute -- a nonprofit membership organization for IT leadership.  Recent jobs for developers, coders for backend structures, as well as traditional corporate IT jobs have been filled recently by workers from the coasts, he said.   Slobotski, who runs a blog called ""Silicon Prairie News"" said high-tech talent and ideas are thriving in the region many coastal residents snidely refer to as ""flyover country."" Some of the newer companies in Nebraska include Agile Sports/ Hudl in Lincoln, and Hayneedle.com and Rockdex in Omaha.  Biotech and green-tech industries are ""still in the discovery stage,"" he said. ""People are talking about how to grow that.""  In Silicon Valley, longtime human resources executive Aryae Coopersmith of HR Forums has noticed a change in the past year.   ""Now that the economy is waking up a little bit and there's more hiring, our members have shifted from few concerns about retaining employees to new concerns about retaining employees,"" said Coopersmith. The work-life balance in middle America could be more appealing, and there are benefits to being a bigger fish in a smaller pond. A lot of the growth is spurred on by people like Brauer, who returned to Kansas with a decade of experience and a phone full of business contacts.  ""I'd been sourcing people from all over the world for the last decade, so working for them didn't necessitate being in L.A.""   The nature of the new economy and the technological advances of the past ten years meant that he could be based anywhere and work for clients worldwide.   ""I remember one day sitting on a tractor at my parents' and needing to be on a conference call -- with clients in India. I turned down the motor, and since I had good cell service, I did it right there.""  ""Business is going fine, it can be done. It's a little bit more difficult to grow your business but your costs are so low [in Kansas], your personal burn rate is much lower,"" said Brauer.

"(CNN)Seriously people, is there something about snow storms that makes us want to eat French toast and sit on the toilet? With every predicted blizzard, there's a mad dash to load up on milk, bread, eggs and toilet paper. But why those particular items? Sure, there are some variations including booze, snack foods and even ice cream. Yet these items are  the first to disappear from store shelves when the dreaded ""snow"" word is mentioned. Are you in the storm's path? Please share your images if you can do so safely. According to AccuWeather.com, we might be able to thank a particular region for at least some of it. ""It appears that New Englanders can take credit for the purchasing of milk and bread prior to the storm,"" the site reported on its site. ""It was the monumental blizzard in 1978 that trapped many in homes for weeks that gets at least some credit for the current tradition. In November 2014, writer Virginia Montanez set out to unravel the mystery for Pittsburgh Magazine. What she found was that during one of that city's worst snowstorms, which began on November 24, 1950, an article in a local newspapers referenced milk as ""the one shortage that has hit all sections"" and bread as being ""doled out in some stores"" because of a storm that ultimately brought almost 3 feet of snow. As for the toilet paper? Montanez had a theory that a line in the story referring to folks being advised to make sure they cooperated by ""buying what they need."" ""I don't know about you, but when I'm listing the things we NEED, if we're going to be snowed in for the next few days, toilet paper is damn sure going to be one of them,"" she wrote. It doesn't appear to make much sense given that one of the major problems in many storms is the loss of power.

"Talk about a vast, isolated island wilderness. Michigan's Isle Royale, one of the few island national parks in the United States, is nestled in the northwest corner of Lake Superior, encompassing 850 square miles of road-less backcountry and water accessible only by a three-hour ferry ride or seaplane. It's so big it has its own lake, Siskiwit Lake. The lake also has its own island, Ryan Island. That makes Ryan Island the largest island on the largest lake on the largest island on the largest freshwater lake in the world. In other words, Isle Royale is a destination. It's not on the way to anything, which makes for special kinds of visitors, park ranger Lucas Westcott said. The average stay is three to four days, compared with just a few hours in other national parks, Westcott said. Repeat visitors return each season to explore the park's 165 miles of hiking trails, coastlines, bays and inlets, red sand beaches and rocky shores. The people who visit Isle Royale really want to be there. ""When people come here, it's deeply personal to them,"" Westcott said. ""For most people who come here, it gets in your blood and you can't stop, and that's a remarkable environment for me to do what I do."" Park stats: Isle Royale was established as a national park in April 1940. The yearly number of visitors to Isle Royale is around 16,500. Location: Isle Royale is in the northwest corner of Lake Superior. It's accessible by boat or seaplane from points in Michigan and Minnesota. If you go: There is a user fee of $4 per day for park visitors ages 12 and older. There are also fees for the four ferries and one seaplane service and other services at the park. Also required: a backcountry/camping permit if you stay overnight in the campgrounds, at dock or anchor out. The park closes for the winter. Meet our ranger: Westcott is no stranger to geographic isolation. He spent part of his childhood in a home his parents built on a mountain in Stephentown, New York, before moving around the rural environs of western Massachusetts. His run with the National Park Service began with a 2001 college internship at South Dakota's Badlands National Park museum, cataloging fossils and museum artifacts. After completing a master's degree in forestry, he was volunteering at the Lincoln Home National Historic Site when a fellow ranger showed him pictures of other parks where he had worked. One was Isle Royale. Its size and location instantly intrigued Westcott. A few years later, he's living his dream of working there. For a day trip, don't miss: Stoll Trail. Named for journalist Albert Stoll, who campaigned to get the island's preserved status, the 4.3-mile loop begins at Rock Harbor on the eastern side of the island and brings visitors to Scoville Point and back. The trail winds back and forth between forest and shoreline, offering stunning views of Scoville Lake, craggy bluffs and barrier islands. Favorite less-traveled spot: Malone Bay, mainly because of the effort it takes to get there. There's only one nine-mile trail that takes visitors there and back, but it's worth the journey for the gorgeous views of Siskiwit Lake, Westcott said. There are also nice campgrounds and a dock for fishing. Favorite spot to view wildlife: Spotting wildlife throughout the park seems to be by luck, not design, Westcott said. For example, no one had seen the pine marten weasel for decades when it suddenly appeared a few years ago. ""If you're quiet while hiking, it might happen,"" he said. ""It's part of what makes it really personal for visitors."" Most magical moment in the park: The first day he arrived, Westcott sat on the dock by Ranger III, the largest ferry servicing Isle Royale, and realized just how quiet it was. ""You become more attuned to what's going on around you,"" he said. Ranger's favorite other park to visit: Wilson's Creek Battlefield National Battlefield in Missouri, the site of the first major Civil War battle west of the Mississippi River and one of the best preserved battlefields in the country. Visitors can follow a loop trail to see how the battle unfolded, Westcott said. What's your favorite national park and why?

"Ai Weiwei is at it again.  This time, the controversial Chinese artist-activist has taken his first venture into music, releasing a heavy metal single and music video inspired by his harrowing detention by the government two years ago. A perpetual thorn in the Chinese government's side, Ai, whose projects have spanned art installations, film, photography, writing, and architecture, was en route to Hong Kong in April 2011 when he was taken into custody at Beijing's international airport. He was detained for 81 days amid a government crackdown on political activists, widely believed to stem from government fears of a potential uprising inspired by the Arab Spring.  Upon his release, Ai was subjected to severe restrictions on his movements and later accused of tax evasion -- charges which he rejected and unsuccessfully challenged in court. Entitled ""Dumbass,"" the five-minute music video features the burly, bearded artist recreating his time in jail to  expletive-laden lyrics denouncing government repression. ""The idea (for this song) first came to me while I was in detention and the guards watching me quietly inquired if I could sing,"" Ai told CNN.  ""That was when I realized that both the guards and I were being detained; in their three years in the army, they had never been allowed to leave this place."" ""For young people around the ages of 19-20, music can spark their imagination and passion, and this small incident moved me.  After I was released, I thought I should write my own song,"" he added. Ai penned the lyrics to ""Dumbass,"" while rock musician Zuoxiao Zuzhou composed the music and Australia's Christopher Doyle directed the video's cinematography. Ai said the dark visuals, from the artist being taken into jail with a black hood to being perpetually accompanied by two guards while eating, sleeping, and using the bathroom, mirrored his ordeal. Some of his jabs at government repression in the video materialize in defiant fantastical elements, such as the river crabs scampering over the toilet (""hexie"" is a pun for ""harmonization"" -- a government euphemism for societal repression) and the horse sitting in for the artist bound to a chair (""caonima"" is a pun for cursing someone's mother). Ai said the ""dumbasses"" and ""f**kers"" he denounced in his lyrics also refer to scholars and intellectuals in China who ""don't have a clear understanding of China.  Despite going through so many disasters, they are still deluded.  I find this ridiculous."" In one scene, the artist's head is shaved by a child -- a reference to his then two-year-old son whom Ai said he constantly thought of during his detention and whom he feared would no longer recognize him by the time he was released. He said the song may help him overcome the trauma of his detention, which he described as ""extremely difficult.""  At the same time, he said he has no regrets over his actions, believing that people have a responsibility to bring hope and warmth into the world -- and that as an artist, he has certain platforms of expression that he should use to this end. ""Many people are still imprisoned, many for much longer (than me) because we all expressed a difference of opinion and were accused of incitement to subvert state power,"" he added.  ""So I have to speak out for them."" Meanwhile, the artist addressed another pressing problem in China -- mainland Chinese, spooked by a scandal over melamine-tainted baby milk formula, have snapped up tins in Hong Kong, leading to a public outcry over the resulting shortage and the institution of a two-can (1.8 kg) cross-border limit in March by the city's authorities. ""Milk Formula"" debuted at a Hong Kong exhibition Friday -- a 10 meter by 8 meter map of China created with 1,815 tins of various brands of baby formula.

"(CNN)Ready for your ""Christmas Vacation""? Just make sure you pack an ax. In 1989, the Griswold family wasn't so lucky in National Lampoon's ""Christmas Vacation,"" the third movie in a franchise that included 1983's inaugural ""Vacation,"" 1985's ""European Vacation"" and 1997's ""Vegas Vacation."" Directed by Jeremiah Chechik in his feature film debut, ""Christmas Vacation"" reunited Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo as Clark and Ellen Griswold, Chicago-area parents of two who never seem to get the ""vacation"" concept quite right. The story, like the original ""Vacation,"" was written by John Hughes and based on his 1980 National Lampoon piece, ""Christmas '59."" While the plot is filled with the usual gags about the disaster-prone Griswolds, it also happens to perfectly capture the hope a lot of us feel around the holidays: the desire to have the biggest and best celebration ever, even if that means stringing up an insane number of tiny, twinkling lights that nearly blind our neighbors and knock out power for the entire neighborhood. When ""Christmas Vacation"" premiered in December 1989, it opened in second place at the box office and went on to gross $71.3 million domestically. Without adjusting for inflation, it's the most successful ""Vacation"" movie of the series. According to The Hollywood Reporter, there will soon be another title to add to the franchise. Simply called ""Vacation,"" the upcoming movie will focus on the Griswold's son Rusty, who in the new movie will be an adult taking his own family on a getaway. Ed Helms has signed on to play the grown-up Rusty Griswold with Leslie Mann as his sister, Audrey, and Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo making cameos as the Griswold parents. That movie is expected to arrive in fall 2015, but in the meantime, we're celebrating ""Christmas Vacation.""

"For weeks leading up to the 2013 off-year elections, prominent Texas Democrats directly blamed the state's new voter ID law for problems in registration. First, Judge Sandra Watts said she had a problem because the name on her driver's license and the name on her voter registration card did not match. It turns out she had left her maiden name on her voter registration. It also turns out that it is the individual's responsibility to ensure that his or her voter information is up to date. Watts was able to vote. Then, state Sen. Wendy Davis, the presumed Democratic nominee for Texas governor, said she had a problem, too. Like Watts, the name on her driver's license did not match the name on her registration card. She signed an affidavit, which the polling place provided, and was able to vote. Then, nearer Election Day, former Speaker of the House Jim Wright said that he, too, had a problem voting. He said the Texas Department of Public Safety would not give him a voter ID card. But Wright, who is 90, tried to use  an expired driver's license, which for most voters serves as their photo ID. How is this the fault of the state or anyone who supports voter ID?  Wright got his card by going home and finding his birth certificate, and was able to vote. We know of these stories because all three prominent Democrats  took those voting problems straight to the media. What we do not know from these three stories is how the voter ID law actually affected turnout. Democrats who oppose voter ID have consistently claimed that it suppresses votes. If they are correct, then Texas should have seen turnout drop off in 2013 compared with the closest comparable election. The 2013 election in Texas was an off-year, constitutional amendment election. Texas holds constitutional amendment elections every two years, after its legislative sessions, to give Texans the opportunity to approve or reject items that the legislature has approved for a vote. The Texas secretary of state administers elections and posts totals going back to 1992. According to the Texas secretary of state's office, 10 amendments were up for vote in 2011, the last constitutional amendment election before the voter ID law passed. Some issues received more votes than others. The one most voted on received 690,052 votes, for and against. Overall, an average of about 672,874 Texans voted on these 10 constitutional amendments. If voter ID suppressed votes, we should see a drop in turnout, right? Well, according to the Texas secretary of state's office, nine amendments went up for vote in 2013. The amendment that attracted the most votes, Proposition One, attracted 1,144,844. The average number of votes cast in 2013 was 1,099,670. So, in terms of raw votes, turnout in 2013 increased by about 63% over turnout in 2011 in comparable elections. But that's statewide. How about in areas the anti-voter ID side predicted should see ""suppression""? Turnout for the 2011 election was 5.37% of registered voters; for 2013 it was about 8%. Democrats allege that voter ID will suppress the vote in predominantly Hispanic regions. Hidalgo County sits on the Texas-Mexico border and is 90% Hispanic. In 2011, an average of just over 4,000 voted in the constitutional amendment election. In 2013, an average of over 16,000 voted. If voter ID was intended to suppress votes, it is failing as spectacularly as HealthCare.gov. Look at Cameron County, which is about 85% Hispanic. Turnout increased from an average of 4,700 votes in 2011 to 5,100 in 2013. So in its first real-world test, Texas' voter ID law -- which 66% of Texans support, according to a 2012 University of Texas poll --  had no impact on suppressing the vote. It even can be argued that voter ID helped increase turnout. Turnout was up, and in fact, the 2013 constitutional amendment election saw the highest constitutional amendment election turnout in Texas in about eight years. Opponents of voter ID must come up with a new line to attack it. The old dog that it suppresses the vote just won't hunt.

"Near the Israel-Gaza border (CNN) -- Hours after a cease-fire was declared Wednesday in Israel's conflict with Gaza, it appeared to be holding, an Israeli official said. ""We assumed it would take a while for the cease-fire to take hold,"" Israel's ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, told CNN. ""I understand now that it has taken hold. There hasn't been fire for a while and, of course, we are not firing, so there is a cease-fire."" His remarks came after an Israeli military spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, told CNN that five rockets had been fired from Gaza in violation of the cease-fire. Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon, in an interview with CNN, put the number of rockets at 12. Wednesday's cease-fire followed eight days of violence along Israel's border with Gaza and nearly 150 deaths -- the vast majority of them Palestinian. Egypt's Morsy praised for his key role in talks . The cease-fire, announced in a joint news conference in Cairo with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr, took effect at 9 p.m. (2 p.m. ET). Gazans took to the streets, firing guns into the air in celebration of what they considered to be a victory over Israel's military. The agreement calls for Israel to halt all acts of aggression on Gaza, including incursions and the targeting of people, according to Egypt's state news agency EGYNews. It also calls for the Palestinian factions to cease all hostilities from Gaza against Israel, including the firing of rockets and attacks on the border. Border crossings were to be opened Thursday night, and the movement of people and goods across them was to be eased, it said. On the ground: Follow updates from CNN's reporters . The agreement came after a day of negotiations that included Clinton, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy and Palestinian officials. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said the agreement calls for ""complete and total cessation of all hostile activity initiated in the Gaza Strip."" ""For us, that's victory. That's what we wanted,"" he said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of possible additional military action if the cease-fire fails to lead to long-term security. ""But at this time, the right thing for the state of Israel is to exhaust this opportunity to obtain a long-term cease fire,"" he said. Netanyahu thanked U.S. President Barack Obama for his ""unreserved support"" of Israel's actions. It was the November 14 assassination by Israeli forces of Ahmed al-Ja'abari, the head of Hamas' military wing, that ignited the fighting. Opinion: Will real change come from this cease-fire? Israel launched its offensive with a stated goal of ending the rocket attacks on southern Israel from inside Gaza by degrading the ability of Palestinians to launch such attacks. ""Their attempts backfired against them,"" said Khaled Meshaal, a Hamas political leader. ""They wanted to destroy the infrastructure of the resistance of Hamas. They claim they have done so, and they have not. They are bankrupt."" He cited Israel's destruction of buildings and killings that included civilians. ""This is their accomplishment,"" he said. ""They have nothing else to show. And our rockets continued to strike them until the last minute."" Israel will hold Hamas responsible for any attacks from Gaza, whether conducted by that organization or any others, Regev said. He said the agreement reflects that understanding. iReport: Share your stories from the region . As he was preparing to return to New York from Tel Aviv, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said late Wednesday his biggest concern was for the safety of civilians, ""no matter where they are. Innocent people, including children, have been killed or injured on both sides. Families on both sides were forced to cower in fear as the violence raged around them."" He said that more than 139 Palestinians had been killed, more than 70 of them civilians, and more than 900 were injured. In addition, some 10,000 Palestinians had lost their homes, he said, adding there was a critical need for humanitarian aid in the territory. IDF's Leibovich dismissed such concerns. ""There is no crisis in Gaza,"" she told CNN, adding that she had seen pictures Wednesday morning of markets filled with fresh produce. ""I understand that some things are not convenient,"" she said. During the conflict, rocket fire killed four Israeli civilians and wounded 219 other people, most of them civilians, three of them seriously, Ban said. In addition, an Israeli soldier was killed and 16 were wounded, one critically, he said. Smuggling weapons to Gaza -- the long way . In all, 1,456 rockets were estimated to have been fired from Gaza into Israel, with three long-range missiles hitting the outskirts of Jerusalem, a move he called ""unprecedented."" Israeli forces reported strikes on more than 1,450 targets in Gaza, Ban said. They targeted, but were not limited to, attacks on rocket-launching sites, military bases, police stations and tunnels along the border with Egypt, he said. Hundreds of other buildings were hit, Ban said, adding that he condemned ""indiscriminate rocket fire from Gaza into Israel,"" but also believed that the ""excessive and disproportionate use of force that endangers civilian lives is intolerable."" Long-term solutions for Gaza and the Palestinians in general must be found, he said. ""Once calm is fully restored and the violence ends, a broader cease-fire will have to address all the underlying causes of conflict, including the full opening of crossings, Palestinian reconciliation and an end to weapons smuggling."" How Middle East has changed since last Gaza conflict . Regev said the deal calls for talks to begin Thursday on easing economic restrictions on Gaza. ""If the border is quiet, that enables us to be more forthcoming,"" he said. Clinton, who shuttled among Israel, the West Bank and Egypt to help negotiate the deal, said the United States will continue to work with regional partners to implement and expand the agreement. Obama spoke Wednesday morning with Morsy, thanking the Egyptian leader for his leadership in negotiating the proposal. As recently as Wednesday afternoon, Hamas officials had been calling for more strikes against Israel, while that country's military continued to press its campaign against what it said were suspected rocket-launching sites and ""terrorist hideouts."" Arab-Americans watch conflict with mix of worry, relief . The cease-fire talks, held in the West Bank, Israel and Cairo, continued despite a lunchtime bus attack near the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv. At least two bombs were planted on the bus, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. One of the bombs exploded, blowing out the windows of the bus, he said. Rosenfeld said 24 people were wounded, three of them seriously. Aviva Shemer with Ichilov Hospital said pedestrians were among the injured. Belief blog: How U.S. Jews view the situation . Police said they were seeking at least one and possibly two suspects. Hamas put its own spin on the attack in a banner on al-Aqsa, calling it ""a natural response to the massacre of the al-Dalou family and targeting of innocent Palestinian civilians."" Nine members of the al-Dalou family died Sunday in an Israeli airstrike, provoking outrage among Palestinians. ""We told you #IDF that our blessed hands will reach your leaders and soldiers wherever they are,"" the al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said on Twitter. ""You opened the Gates of Hell on Yourselves."" Diplomats said they were hoping to avoid a repeat of 2008 and 2009, when at least 1,400 people died as Israeli troops invaded Gaza after similar rocket attacks.

"Think back on your past 24 hours. How much time did you spend on your smartphone? Were you mostly texting, reading news, checking Twitter, or were you actually talking to another human? The answer may vary if you are an Android or an iPhone user. A new study from Experian digs into the details of how people use their phones and finds that users on all systems spend an average of 58 minutes a day on their smartphones. Even with all the bells, whistles and apps, the biggest chunk of that time is spent talking on the phone. There are differences in the way iPhone and Android users divvy up their time. Users of the iPhone spend more time on their devices a day (26 minutes more) but a smaller percentage of time talking and surfing the Web than their Android counterparts and more time texting and snapping photographs. The study does not delve into how many minutes each side spends arguing online over which system is better. Whatever the operating system, smartphones are still primarily used as communication devices, according to the study. On average, people spend 26% of their smartphone quality-time talking, 20% texting and 9% e-mailing. Social networking takes up 16% of our time, while games and ""other"" activities  account for 8% and 9%, respectively. Watching videos accounted for a small amount of time on average, but those who do usually watch videos a little more than four times a day for a total of five minutes daily. Reading is also a blip, according to the study, with a half percentage of people reading on their smartphones each day.","iPhone users typically spend more time on their phones than Android users, study finds .

"Ever have one of those days where you just wanna be alone, maybe have the planet to yourself? Well, based on sheer numbers, there may be a planet just for you. Astronomers at the University of California-Berkeley and the University of Hawaii, using data from NASA's Kepler space telescope, estimate there are tens of billions of Earth-size, possibly habitable planets in our Milky Way galaxy. Given that there just more than 7 billion of us on this planet, that means a planet for each of us with some spares for your picky neighbors. Or a vacation planet or two for you, maybe. And the closest may be circling a star you can see if you look up into the heavens tonight. ""When you look up at the thousands of stars in the night sky, the nearest sun-like star with an Earth-size planet in its habitable zone is probably only 12 light years away and can be seen with the naked eye. That is amazing,"" UC Berkeley graduate student Erik Petigura, the leader of the team that analyzed data from the Kepler, said in a press release. Lonely, young planet drifting in space without a star . To be sure, the astronomers haven't seen any of the planets themselves. They came to their conclusions like this: . The Kepler telescope photographed 150,000 of the 300 billion stars in the Milky Way every 30 minutes for four years. It looked for when orbiting planets passed between the camera and the star, causing a slight change in brightness of that star. Analyzing the data, the astronomers say, they found 3,000 planet candidates. The astronomers narrowed that number by focusing on just 42,000 stars like our sun or a bit cooler. That brought the number of planets down to 603. But only 10 of those were about the size of Earth in the so-called ""Goldilocks zone,"" just the right distance from the star where temperatures are suitable for life as we know it. Diamonds may be produced on other planets . So how did they get a number of planets in the billions? By using a computer model with fake planets to test the validity of the algorithms used in the calculations. ""What we're doing is taking a census of extrasolar planets, but we can't knock on every door. Only after injecting these fake planets and measuring how many we actually found could we really pin down the number of real planets that we missed,"" Petigura said in the press release. Using the data, the astronomers calculated that 22% of stars in the Milky Way similar to our sun have planets like Earth in their ""Goldilocks zone."" As there are about 20 billion stars similar to the sun in the galaxy, the possibilities add up quickly -- more than one for each of us Earthlings. Stargazing in the desert: The magic of Namibia's night skies . The researchers do caution, though, that despite being in the habitable zone, a planet could still not be right to host life. ""Some may have thick atmospheres, making it so hot at the surface that DNA-like molecules would not survive. Others may have rocky surfaces that could harbor liquid water suitable for living organisms. We don't know what range of planet types and their environments are suitable for life,"" Geoffrey Marcy, UC Berkeley professor of astronomy, said in a press release. But the study gives researchers a number to work with. ""The primary goal of the Kepler mission was to answer the question: When you look up in the night sky, what fraction of the stars that you see have Earth-size planets at lukewarm temperatures so that water would not be frozen into ice or vaporized into steam, but remain a liquid, because liquid water is now understood to be the prerequisite for life,"" Marcy said. ""Until now, no one knew exactly how common potentially habitable planets were around Sun-like stars in the galaxy."" The new study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and was discussed this week at the second Kepler Science Conference, being held at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. Also at the gathering, scientists announced the Kepler telescope has found 833 new candidate planets, including 10 that are of the right size and right distance from their stars to host life, adding to ones previously confirmed. That brings the official list to 3,538 planet candidates found using Kepler, according to a NASA press release. Of those, smaller Earth-sized planets are most common, NASA said.","Astronomers used Kepler telescope data to extrapolate number of planets in Milky Way .

"The man before me is not yet 30. He stands, perhaps a little unsure of himself, a nervous tic in his shoulders seeming to betray his unease. Before him is one of the largest armies on the planet. It is a war machine, still fighting a battle from more than half a century ago. They move in lockstep, legs kicking and arms swinging as one, discipline and focus measured in millimeters. A vast arsenal of weapons, missiles and tanks, pass by. The cost of this show of military might has been paid in the suffering of the people it is primed to defend. Aid groups say thousands have starved here; meanwhile, the army has grown fat. The young man eyeing all of this is master of all he surveys. This is North Korea, and the man is Kim Jong Un. Kim Jong Un named marshal of North Korean army . This was a rare glimpse indeed of a man who now rules the notorious hermit kingdom. In April this year, North Korea opened its doors to the world's media. CNN was there to cover the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the country's founding father, Kim Il Sung. The eternal president and ""Great Leader"" had passed power to his ""Dear Leader"" son, the erratic, eccentric Kim Jong Il. Now a third generation Kim, the so-called ""Supreme Leader,"" stood on the shoulders of his forebears. He gained power by birthright, but the world is watching as he attempts to rule in his own right. ""He is the youngest head of state in the world,"" said analyst Patrick Chovanec. ""There's still a lot of debate about how much power he has, whether other family members are in control or the military."" Reading North Korean tea leaves . His soldiers certainly pay lip service to their loyalty. These men are combat ready, never forgetting they have a sworn enemy in the United States. ""With the strategy of the great leader Kim Il Sung, the dear Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un with our bombs and weapons we will destroy them,"" they tell me. But beyond the war rhetoric are the realities of leading an impoverished, isolated and paranoid country. As I stood below him at this military parade, my mind wandered to the young Kim's thoughts. What would have been going through his mind? We're told he was educated partly in Switzerland, loves music and western movies and is a huge basketball fan. But the country he rules is largely sealed off from the outside world. People here mostly don't have telephones; they never get exposure to foreign television, newspapers or films. The world is defined by endless statues, portraits and tributes to the cult of the Kims. What Kim's 'mystery woman' says about North Korea . When CNN visited Pyongyang, North Korea was putting on its most intimidating face. But amid this display of what the regime called power and prosperity was the lone voice of the young leader. For the first time North Koreans heard him speak. This is why he appeared nervous. Kim Jong Un mouthed the usual threats and warnings, but there was something different: an acknowledgment that North Korea must find a better future. ""Our fellow citizens, who are the best citizens in the world, who have overcome countless struggles and hardships, it is our party's firmest resolve not to let our citizens go hungry again,"" he said. It was an important, if veiled, concession. Yes, North Korean people had suffered. Yes, the regime was responsible -- not just for the past but a better future. ""This was really his introduction. A few years ago no one even knew he existed but they're being told to worship him,"" Chovanec said. Our government-assigned minders escorted us around the city. They were there to make sure that what we saw and heard was strictly according to the party line. In North Korea it is impossible to separate what is genuine and what is just for show. In the streets of the capital, Pyongyang, we were given a glimpse of the great future Kim Jong Un was promising. We were taken to bustling neighborhoods, saw families shopping, cars on the street. But all of this only served to hide another harsher reality. Outside this showcase city, life was so very different. In the bleak countryside, aid groups say people continue to starve. Defectors tell of surviving on little more than corn. Children are reportedly malnourished and have stunted growth. All the while billions of dollars are still spent on high-tech missiles and nuclear weapons. This is the essence of this secretive country. Kim Jong Un may struggle to emerge from the shadows of his father and grandfather, but the gun here looms even larger. As young and green as he is, he knows this much: Without it, his rule and the regime itself will not survive.","North Korea's Kim Jong Un is the third generation of a powerful dynasty .

"I'm really not sure how I feel about the color purple. It's elegant and regal, but part of me also wants it to die in a ditch. No offense to our mountain majesties or eggplants. But, really, purple is kind of a confused, soulless color that, deep down, wishes it was blue, yet can't shake the fact that somewhere down on the family tree one of its relatives had hot, unprotected color sex with red. ""I shall not deny my feelings for you."" ""That's great, Blue. But what's with the leather chaps?"" Love it or hate it, get used to it. Purple is going to be big in 2014, at least according to our color overlords at the Pantone corporation who recently announced the upcoming color of the year: Radiant Orchid. With its ""enchanting harmony of fuchsia, purple and pink undertones,"" Radiant Orchid actually seems rather zen and peaceful. But it also sounds exotic and, dare I say, mildly hallucinagenic. Trust me, someone at CU-Boulder will find a way to smoke this color. Now, if it all seems a little weird to you -- the fact that there even exists a color of the year -- understand that Pantone, headquartered in Carlstadt, New Jersey, heralds itself as ""the global color authority and provider of professional color standards for the design industry."" Basically, the company name has become synonymous worldwide with color language and communication. That means a designer in Denmark can say to a manufacturer in Pittsburgh, ""We want all of our widgets to be Pantone Winter Booger"" and they'll both know exactly what that looks like. That's assuming Winter Booger is actually a shade of green in Pantone's official palette. If it's not, it should be. I have several samples under my desk. Regardless, Pantone 18-3224, Radiant Orchid, is apparently the big color for next year. And why? Because they said so. Granted, there's a lot of research that goes into this big decision, for choosing a color of the year is slightly more involved than just asking your buddy, Dave, to decide. ""Orange."" ""Can you be more specific, Dave?"" ""You know, like an orange."" It has to be bigger than that. After all, this is the one color that will supposedly express ""what is taking place in the global zeitgeist"" Thus, to finally crown Radiant Orchid, Pantone searched the world over for design and color influences, pulling ideas from entertainment to technology. And, in the end, viewing the planet as one big global community, they decided, ""Welp, this is sorta where we're at."" Purple. Of course, Radiant Orchid marks is a drastic departure from 2013's wild and daring color of the year, Pantone 17-5641 Emerald. Which, I submit, looks astonishingly close to Winter Booger. Perhaps as a return to civility, Radiant Orchid appears somewhat closer to 2012's color of the year, Pantone 17-1463 Tangerine Tango. ""Can you be more specific, Dave?"" ""You know, like a tangerine tango."" Really, I have no idea what the hell any of this means. But, especially to those in the design community, it matters. And, somehow, as a brand, Pantone has actually become culturally iconic. At least in certain circles. In fact, now you can literally buy accessories like mugs and iPhone cases that are intentionally designed to look like a Pantone color swatch. It's sort of like getting your favorite element from the periodic table printed on something because, damn it, you love Boron. But, Pantone merchandise, in a way, actually makes sense. I mean, why not express and represent yourself with a color. Perhaps asking one's Pantone will even become a part of our lexicon. ""Hey man, what's your Pantone?"" ""Oh, I'm not wearing pants today."" So, in 2014 keep an eye out for purple. From fashion runways to websites to living rooms, Radiant Orchid is going to be everywhere. That, and Winter Booger. Well, maybe not everywhere. But definitely under my desk. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.","The Pantone company announced its 2014 color of the year: Radiant Orchid .

"In recent years, social games have become increasingly prevalent on mobile devices, providing entertainment, yes, but also a way to maintain contact with family and friends. But for Debbie Fisher, who's legally blind, the visual displays used to play and chat meant they were off limits to her. Fisher, 37, is a mother of four from Reno, Nevada, who has a genetic disorder called retinitis pigmentosa. She can only see light and dark shapes and cannot discern details. Fisher said she has always enjoyed playing games with her family. However, she usually needed other people around in order to be able to play. After she got an iPhone and iPad, she tried playing some of the downloadable games, but due to her visual impairment, she couldn't find a game that she enjoyed and that allowed her to play with her friends. Fisher uses the Voice Over accessibility program on her mobile devices to help her ""see"" what's on the screen and interact with it. Still, she said it was tough to find games that were compatible with the program. ""I always get the free version (of games) to make sure it is Voice Over compatible, which is what makes the iPhone and the iPad talk,"" she said. ""If it works, then I'll get the paid version, but I need to make sure it works first."" That's opened up some options. But only one game, she says, has let her both play and communicate with friends. ""Hanging With Friends"" (Zynga) is a word game that resembles Hangman, but with a few twists. One player comes up with a word that another player tries to guess one letter at a time. Get a letter wrong and the balloons holding up your avatar will start popping until there is nothing to save you from the lava pit below. The game, which debuted in July, is played one-on-one with anyone anywhere. Fisher said ""Hanging With Friends"" specifically works with Voice Over and lets her ""see"" what's going on and chat with her family and friends who are playing. ""Playing a game against the computer is one thing. But playing against real people is what makes it so much better,"" she said. Paul Bettner, general manager of Zynga With Friends, said they didn't intend to make a game for the visually impaired, but are pleased that their game can be enjoyed by people like Fisher. ""It may seem silly to think that a game can change someone's world, but why not?"" Bettner said. "" 'Hanging With Friends' was designed so that nearly anyone can pick it up and play and we are very happy and proud to welcome visually impaired players now as well."" Fisher said there are other games that are Voice Over compatible, but they don't allow for the social interaction that ""Hanging With Friends"" does. She said she hopes more social games will embrace the Voice Over program so she can enjoy them with her family and friends. "" 'Hanging With Friends' really wasn't my type of game until I started playing it,"" she said. ""I wouldn't have even guessed that I'd be so into that game before I started playing it. But I love this game.""","Blind gamer is able to 'hang with friends' via social gaming .

"There's romance in our National Parks, and not just the human kind. A self-described hopeless romantic, park ranger Margaret Adams likes to lead the full moon night hikes at Cuyahoga Valley National Park in Ohio. You'll have to leave your flashlight behind as you head out at dusk, and Adams likes to change her route, so all you'll know is that the full moon will light the way and it will last about two hours. You might encounter animals stirring in the night. During February's full moon hike, Adams and her hikers spotted a couple of deer ahead and later, a pair of coyotes. That's part of the magic at Cuyahoga Valley Park, which was created as a National Recreation Area on December 27, 1974, and was named a National Park on October 11, 2000. Park stats: Cuyahoga Valley National Park is the 10th most visited National Park in the country with 2.3 million visitors last year. (Great Smoky Mountains National Park came in first place with 9.7 million visitors.) The park's boundaries encompass nearly 33,000 acres. About 5% of the park (or 2,400 acres) are still privately owned. The location: Cuyahoga Valley National Park is between Akron and Cleveland in northeastern Ohio, along 22 miles of the Cuyahoga River. If you go: There's no fee to enter the park, although there are admission fees for some concerts and other programs. Meet our ranger: Margaret Adams didn't expect to fall in love with Cuyahoga Valley when she started as a seasonal ranger there in 1999. She had grown up in nearby Canton and had only spent a little time there during summer camps and other trips. Adams was studying elementary education at the University of Akron, and her love of the park caught her by surprise. ""I decided that by the time I walked the stage at graduation, you need to have decided if you're going to be a teacher or park ranger,"" she said. The park chose her: She was offered a spot in the park's junior ranger program for the summer and was hired permanently in 2000. ""I'm still a teacher. I just have a different classroom."" ""There's nothing better than seeing a little kid looking at their Junior Ranger book,"" she said. ""I tell them, 'It's your national park.' And then they take ownership."" Fourteen years later, she credits the serenity and tranquility of the park with keeping her multiple sclerosis in check. ""My neurologist can't believe I'm still doing this job,"" she said. ""I told him it's because of this job that I'm doing this well."" For a day trip, don't miss:  Brandywine Falls. The 65-foot Brandywine Falls serves as Adams' spiritual retreat in the park. ""My mother and two ladies from our church rode the train up one Sunday, and I took them on a little tour,"" she said. ""I work on Sunday, and I told them, 'You don't need to worry about me.' I showed them I can connect right here (at the falls). The water is flowing. It's very serene and calming. All three of them said they got it. "" Brandywine Falls is an excellent example of the geology of waterfalls:  A layer of harder rock capping the waterfall, with layers of softer rock below.  It's also wonderful history lesson, as the waterfall was a source of power for a sawmill built in 1814. While most of the town surrounding the falls is gone, the house built by the sawmill owner's son is operated as a bed-and-breakfast. If you have a little more time, head to the Ledges Overlook and Beaver Marsh, said Adams. At the Ledges, perhaps the most popular overlook at the park, you can see the entire Cuyahoga Valley. Sunsets are particularly spectacular. It's an easy walk from the parking lot or you can enjoy the 2.2 mile loop trail. ""I love sitting there and looking at the vastness,"" she said. ""It's open space and very serene."" ""There is so much activity at Beaver Marsh because the beavers come out, and there are a lot of birds down there,"" said Adams. She's seen a great blue heron landing to catch a fish, snakes and snapping turtles. Favorite less-traveled spot: Indigo Lake. Formerly a sand and gravel quarry, a tributary filled it with water and now it's a great place to fish, said Adams. ""It's a beautiful and serene lake,"" she said. ""It's not a huge lake, and it's very tranquil."" Favorite spot to view wildlife: Oak Hill Trail.  Adams has spotted great blue herons and heard the frogs during her fall hikes to see the changing colors. ""You're hiking in the woods and you come into a clearing at Sylvan Pond,"" she said. She has also led full moon hikes there, which the park has every month in different locations when the moon is full. Most magical moment in the park:  Adams had gone to the Grand Canyon in 2000 for training, and she says she didn't really appreciate her home park until she got back. ""I was driving back into work when something clicked and I realized how much I loved this place. Having been surrounded by the sunburnt colors of the Grand Canyon, I saw how much I loved the color green. I really appreciated this park. It was just the right size for me."" Funniest moment at the park: ""When I started working here, a lady asked where she could walk her pet llama,"" said Adams. The park has programs with horses, but Adams had never worked with llamas. She took the question up the park's chain of the command and discovered that llamas are indeed allowed, with restrictions. ""A llama is considered a pack animal, and so she could walk her llama on a leash on any of the bridle trails,"" on the same trails where horses are allowed. A ranger's request: Please don't feed the animals, she said. ""We tell people, but they do it anyway. It's not good for them. They need to do things on their own and not depend on us."" If you see a hurt animal, tell a ranger. Some animals can bite if scared or provoked. Another park she'd like to visit:  Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, with its active volcanoes, is the next National Park on Adams' bucket list. She may be able to get there through a 6-to-9 month park ranger swap. (Check out the park website before you plan a visit, since some sections of the park may be closed because of volcanic activity.) ""That one looked awesome with the volcanoes going off and hitting the water,"" she said. ""It looks surreal."" What's your favorite national park and why? Please tell us in the comments section below.","Ranger Margaret Adams finds serenity and peace in the park's waterfalls and lakes .

"(CNN) -- TV host Bill Maher started his career as a standup comedian. But students at the University of California, Berkeley aren't laughing at his latest antics; they're petitioning to have him removed as their 2014 fall commencement speaker. ""Bill Maher is a blatant bigot and racist who has no respect for the values UC Berkeley students and administration stand for,"" a petition on Change.org states. ""In a time where climate is a priority for all on campus, we cannot invite an individual who himself perpetuates a dangerous learning environment. ""Bill Maher's public statements on various religions and cultures are offensive and his dangerous rhetoric has found its way into our campus communities."" The petition points to a recent episode of Maher's HBO show ""Real Time"" as an example. (HBO, like CNN, is a division of Time Warner.) When actor Ben Affleck appeared on the program in early October, their conversation turned into a heated debate about Islam that many in the Muslim community found hurtful. ""Islam is the only religion that acts like the mafia that will f***ing kill you if you say the wrong thing,"" Maher said during the episode, which is cited on the students' petition as an example of Maher's ""hate speech."" The Change.org petition had more than 2,200 signatures as of Tuesday morning. It appears to have been written by Khwaja Ahmed, an active member of the Middle Eastern, Muslim and South Asian Coalition, according to Berkeley's student newspaper. This isn't the only petition on the site about Maher. Several have called for his firing from ""Real Time,"" though they don't seem to have garnered much traction. Maher has been on the show for 12 years and has become known for his controversial statements on a wide range of topics. One of Maher's favorite targets is organized religion. His 2008 documentary ""Religulous"" grossed more than $13 million, according to Box Office Mojo.","Berkeley students post petition to remove Bill Maher as commencement speaker .

"Egyptian voters who went to the polls this week have overwhelmingly approved a new constitution, a spokesman for Egypt's electoral commission announced Saturday in a national broadcast. The referendum passed handily with 98.1% voting in favor of the new constitution and 1.9 percent voting no, the commission official told reporters in Cairo. The head of the Egypt Constitutional Committee described the turnout as ""unprecedented"" -- 20 million people, representing 38.6% of those eligible to vote. Supporters of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood had boycotted the vote, which took place Tuesday and Wednesday, in response to a continuing government crackdown. The Brotherhood had supported the country's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsy, who was ousted last July in a military coup. The Anti-Coup Alliance, composed largely of supporters of Morsy and the Brotherhood, rejected the results in a posting on its Twitter account: ""98.1% is not considered a real democracy but a solo dictatorship,"" it said. ""If people are arrested for holding 'vote NO' posters ... should these results be counted?"" The head of the committee heaped praise on this week's results, calling them a move forward on the path toward democracy. Rights groups have expressed concern about what they call an increasingly repressive environment in Egypt, where more than 2,200 people have been killed since the ouster of Morsy, who had replaced strongman Hosni Mubarak after he stepped aside in February 2011 amid the massive anti-government demonstrations that were part of the Arab Spring. Many officials in the international community, too, have spoken out against the Egyptian government's crackdown on dissenters. In a statement Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated his own country's ""serious concern about the limits on freedom of peaceful assembly and expression in Egypt."" The new constitution could be a positive milestone for the volatile North African nation, Kerry said, so long as its leaders stand by it. ""It's what comes next that will shape Egypt's political, economic and social framework for generations,"" Kerry said. ""As Egypt's transition proceeds, the United States urges the interim Egyptian government to fully implement those rights and freedoms that are guaranteed in the new constitution for the benefit of the Egyptian people, and to take steps toward reconciliation.""","Top U.S. diplomat says constitution could be good for Egypt if leaders abide by it .

"With the boom of Internet booking sites, the traditional travel agent was, we were told, an endangered species. CareerCast recently included travel agents in its roundup of ""useless jobs."" For younger, independent, brand-disloyal, budget-conscious travelers used to the Web and getting instant information, the idea of having somebody else book your trip while you wait is all wrong. To be sure, many agents are no longer with us. In the United States there are about 13,000 travel retail locations, down from a peak of 34,000 in the mid-1990s. But they also account for a third of the U.S. travel market -- some $95 billion in 2011, according to a recent study by PhoCusWright, a travel market research company. So what happened? Did the naysayers get it wrong? Agent evolution . The reality is that the typical travel agency of 15 or so years ago, which focused on point-to-point trips, is largely dead. But as online bookings have grown, new breeds of agent have emerged that target luxury, business and niche travelers who value personal relationships and expertise over savings. ""Some industry watchers indicate a return to the traditional agent,"" says Douglas Quinby, principal analyst at PhoCusWright. But they're wrong, he adds. In the valley of the recession in 2009, luxury and business travel took serious losses, especially compared to deeply discounted travel; traditional agents were hardest hit, losing nearly a quarter of their revenues. But then they rebounded, and fast, and the areas with the sharpest declines were the same ones that rebounded fastest, led by corporate travel. That led to reports of booming business in this area, which is not inaccurate, but doesn't tell the whole story, either. ""We've seen continual incremental shift to online channels. We see no migration back to travel agents."" But they still account for $95 billion in revenue, so who's using them? Below are some areas where travel agents are still succeeding. Corporate travel . Agencies in this area analyze a company's travel patterns and suggest ways to save money, such as discounts through the managed travel provider. Some are popular with executives, as they provide interfaces that limit the number of options available. Many executives admit to not sticking to their company's travel policies because they book whatever is most convenient, according to a report by Carlson Wagonlit Travel. And the business traveler by day can become a DIYer by night. ""When it comes to business travel, most people don't check online. They just want to book,"" says Ashutosh Sharma of Sadhana Travel Services, a boutique agency in New Delhi. ""But when it comes to holiday travel, that has gone substantially online. When the same person is now paying from their own pocket, they care much more [about price]."" Luxury . The luxury market also works well under the agency model and has the benefit of being to some degree recession- and even Internet-proof. ""When you've got people who are 50-plus and have got money, the recession doesn't change that,"" says Graham Pickett, head of travel, hospitality and leisure at Deloitte UK. Pickett says that the luxury traveler ""wants to talk to someone who has experience. That's a sustainable model."" Cruises . Cruise line and tour operator sales remain a lifeline for agents catering to the leisure sector, according to the PhoCusWright report. These income streams still pay agents' commissions and agents still book these more often than individuals do. Complicated and important trips . Travelers also seek agents for complex itineraries and once-in-a-lifetime trips, such as honeymoons. Emerging markets . Although online bookings are growing rapidly in emerging markets, in northern Asian countries such as Japan and Korea, there's still a substantial amount of offline booking, especially when people travel to countries where they don't speak the language, says Pickett. In China, where large numbers of first-time travelers are heading overseas, it's common to travel with an organized group. ""It's very different than the mature U.S. market, where people are more comfortable traveling internationally independently,"" says Quinby. Germany . In Germany, one-on-one contact is still more common than in other developed countries, partly due to remote credit card restrictions. Specialty trips . ""Agents are trying to differentiate themselves, to be much more specialist,"" says Pickett. Niches catering to specific activities, sports and students are viable or those catering to journalist and nonprofit circles. Sharma fielded calls in the middle of the night from journalists leaving at the last minute to cover the Arab Spring, or trying to get out of Afghanistan or Libya ASAP. Normally seats can't be booked online within six hours of departure, but Sharma has booked seats as clients rush to the airport. What's next? Social media and travel apps are expected to continue to whittle away at the remaining agency share. Agents who embrace technology to improve their clients' experience -- say, with webcast discussions with a rep -- can improve their chances of survival. It seems that those who initially predicted technology would eclipse the need for human agents underestimated the needs of Baby Boomers, Luddites, executives, the wealthy and the super-niche. The travel agent as we knew it is dying. But it's not yet dead. Do you prefer to book online or via an agent? Tell us why in the comments.","Travel agents in the United States down from 34,000 to 13,000 .

"Although my work has been in Washington, D.C., my home and heart have always been along the beautiful coastline of the Monterey Peninsula in California. It's a place where I first developed my dedication to public service. And it inspired what would become a lifelong effort to promote responsible stewardship of our oceans. Healthy oceans benefit all Americans, whether they live on our nation's coasts or in the heartland. That's why I eagerly agreed in the mid-2000s to help lead the Pew Ocean Commission, a special effort to bring together leading voices from around the United States to examine the health of our oceans through the lens of science, not partisan politics. Ten years ago, the commission released its findings, the nation's first comprehensive report on the state of America's marine environment in more than 40 years.  Because of leadership from both sides of the aisle in Congress and from Democratic and Republican administrations alike, we've made remarkable progress over the past decade since the release of that report to address many of the problems it identified. But, there's still much work to be done. Our oceans are a tremendous economic engine, providing jobs for millions of Americans, directly and indirectly, and a source of food and recreation for countless more. Yet, for much of U.S. history, the health of America's oceans has been taken for granted, assuming its bounty was limitless and capacity to absorb waste without end. This is far from the truth. The situation the commission found in 2001 was grim. Many of our nation's commercial fisheries were being depleted and fishing families and communities were hurting. More than 60% of our coastal rivers and bays were degraded by nutrient runoff from farmland, cities and suburbs. Government policies and practices, a patchwork of inadequate laws and regulations at various levels, in many cases made matters worse. Our nation needed a wake-up call. The situation, on many fronts, is dramatically different today because of a combination of leadership initiatives from the White House and old-fashioned bipartisan cooperation on Capitol Hill. Perhaps the most dramatic example can be seen in the effort to end overfishing in U.S. waters. In 2005, President George W. Bush worked with congressional leaders to strengthen America's primary fisheries management law, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This included establishment of science-based catch limits to guide decisions in rebuilding depleted species. These reforms enacted by Congress are paying off. In fact, an important milestone was reached last June when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced it had established annual, science-based catch limits for all U.S. ocean fish populations. We now have some of the best managed fisheries in the world. Progress also is evident in improved overall ocean governance and better safeguards for ecologically sensitive marine areas. In 2010, President Barack Obama issued a historic executive order establishing a national ocean policy directing federal agencies to coordinate efforts to protect and restore the health of marine ecosystems. President George W. Bush set aside new U.S. marine sanctuary areas from 2006 through 2009. Today, the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, one of several marine monuments created by the Bush administration, provides protection for some of the most biologically diverse waters in the Pacific. Despite the strides made in the 10 years since the Pew Oceans Commission issued its report, challenges remain. Coastal development continues, largely unchecked, and wetlands and marshes continue to shrink. That exposes more than half of the Americans who live along the coasts to the physical and economic damage caused by increasingly high-intensity storms such as Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy. On top of that, major challenges that the commission could not see as clearly in 2003, including ocean acidification and rising ocean temperatures, further threaten some of our most valuable fisheries. The United States must pursue a broader, ecosystem-based approach to build resilience in our oceans and respond to future threats. Over my many years in public service, I've seen many commissions come and go. But I'm perhaps most proud of the work the Pew Ocean Commission did to warn about the threat posed to our oceans and call for change. Every time I take my grandchildren to play on the beaches of Monterey Bay, my resolve to keep the issue of responsible ocean stewardship forefront on the agenda of policymakers in Washington becomes even stronger.","Leon Panetta has worked in Washington, but his beloved California coastline is home .

"(PopSci.com) -- By next fall, NASA plans to launch its biggest Red Planet rover yet, the $1.8-billion, SUV-size Mars Research Laboratory. Even though the MRL will be able to haul five times as much equipment as the Spirit and Opportunity rovers that are already on Mars, a group of Swedish researchers say that they could accomplish far more if accompanied by a squad of helper 'bots. Round robotic sidekicks help NASA rovers scout Martian territory in this illustration. Fredrik Bruhn, the CEO of Ångström Aerospace Corporation, and his colleagues have designed the small inflatable scouts to assist bigger, less mobile rovers in their hunt for signs of microbial life on Mars. Each foot-wide, 11-pound ball can roll up to 62 miles, snap photos at any angle, and take soil samples, drawing its power from the solar panels on its shell. Unlike wheeled rovers, the rounded scouts have fewer motors to repair, never flip over, and are easier to seal from dust. Plus, they rarely get stuck. ""The beauty of the system is it needs very little energy to go around rocks, so unless you're landing on a surface that looks like a bed of nails, it should be fine,"" Bruhn says. In 2004, Bruhn helped found Swedish company Rotundus, whose Earth-based GroundBot is now test-patrolling a harbor in Stockholm. By using GroundBot's pendulum-propulsion mechanism, swapping in a radiation-proof computer, and designing a lightweight, inflatable shell, he thinks he could produce four of the Mars balls for as little as $6 million. ""We just need to assemble the bits and pieces and test it,"" says Bruhn, who shows his design to NASA officials this month. More about rolling around the Red Planet . INFLATION: The deflated scouts are stored in boxes aboard the Mars Research Laboratory. After landing, a latch opens the box, and a spring inside gently rolls them onto the Martian surface. This motion triggers a canister of xenon gas inside the ball to release and inflate the scouts before they hit the ground. EXPLORATION: Each ball runs on two solar-powered motors. One motor swings a pendulum to move the ball's center of mass, building forward- or backward-moving momentum. To turn, a second motor tilts the pendulum along the main axle -- ""the same physics used to fly a helicopter,"" Bruhn says. The robot can automatically decrease its internal pressure to more easily roll over soft surfaces and patches of sand. COMMUNICATION: The autonomous scouts would collect data on the conductivity and age of the Martian terrain, take photos, and send information back to the MRL and ground control. The MRL serves as the scouts' communication hub, receiving and transmitting messages from each ball.

"Britain's Prince Harry made no mention of his recent Las Vegas shenanigans when he spoke at a charity awards dinner in London on Monday. At least, not directly. The 27-year-old prince spoke at the annual awards gala of the British charity WellChild, which helps seriously ill children and their families throughout the United Kingdom. Harry, who is patron of the charity, said he is always humbled by the inspirational stories of the winners and finds it difficult to describe how remarkable they are. ""But never one to be shy in coming forward, I give it a go,"" Harry said. After a few nervous giggles in the audience, Harry laughed, and the whole room then laughed with him. UK tabloid prints naked Prince Harry pictures . It was nearly two weeks ago that pictures emerged of the prince partying naked in a Las Vegas hotel suite.

"The boundary between Tennessee and North Carolina might be one of the loveliest border crossings ever: It's the crest of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Hikers on the Appalachian Trail walk the line between the two states for most of the trail's path through the park. Incredible biological diversity is one of the Smokies' standout features. Animals and plants typically found in the northern United States are found at the park's higher elevations, while at lower elevations, the flora and fauna of the Southern states are represented. Elevations reach 6,643 feet in the Smokies, which are among the oldest mountains in the world. Park stats: Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited National Park in the country with 9.7 million visitors last year. It occupies 800 square miles in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. More than 17,000 species have been found in the park. The location: Great Smoky Mountains National Park is in North Carolina and Tennessee. If you go: Entry to the park is free. Camping costs range from $14 to $23 per night. Meet our ranger: A second-generation park ranger, Caitlin Worth knows her national parks well. Her father and mother met working for the Park Service at Washington's National Mall. The family followed her father to his postings at Acadia National Park in Maine and the Great Smokies. (Her father retired as head of the Great Smokies' public affairs office last year.) Worth did summer internships at the park while in college and graduate school, and she was hired permanently three years ago. Now Worth, her husband and new baby live just a mile from the park. ""I fell in love with this park when I worked here (as a seasonal intern) and couldn't figure out why I'd ever want to be anywhere else,"" she says.  ""There are so many historical resources here. There are so many places you could close your eyes and open them again and you're in the past."" For a day trip, don't miss: Cades Cove right after sunup (especially in the summer) to see the misty valley waking up and the wildlife at its most active.  You might spend a few hours there. ""One of biggest mistakes people make, if they have only one day, is to start at 10 a.m. You've already missed the best hours. It's hot and busy, and they don't see it the way they should."" If you have a little more time, drive up and over the mountain to Clingmans Dome, the park's highest point. You can walk up to the observation tower and even walk a little bit of the Appalachian Trail. ""The Southern Appalachian mountains are pretty spectacular."" Favorite less-traveled spot: The hike to the Mount Cammerer Fire Tower is Worth's favorite hike to see spring wildflowers and changing fall colors. But it's not for novices. It's a long hike -- about 11 miles round trip or 17 miles in a loop -- and it's not flat. ""I like a hike that makes me feel like I worked for it,"" she says.  ""It's a good challenge hike if you're up for one. And it's quiet, which is sometimes hard to find in the park."" Favorite spot to view wildlife: While Cades Cove is filled with people wanting to see bears, Worth loves to spot elk and spring bird migrations in the Oconaluftee Valley. The Oconaluftee River Trail runs through the valley, as does the road (in case you're worn out at this point). ""There's something about that valley in the morning that's spectacular,"" she says. ""There's an ethereal quality."" Most magical moment: Leading a group of second-graders to see Mingus Mill, Worth suggested the children pretend they saddle up on their imaginary horses with their imaginary bags to collect corn from the mill. Then everyone galloped up the hill to the mill. ""You can imagine a ranger galloping up the hill in full uniform?"" says Worth, laughing. ""The class wanted to ride their horses all day. And they asked if the horses could look like whatever they wanted."" Yes, of course, she told them. Her horse had purple stripes and sparkles. ""By the end of the day, the kids really fell in love with their horses. One girl came up to me and said, 'Thank you for letting us come to the park. Can we take our horses home with us?' "" Another favorite national park: The Florida side of the Gulf Islands National Seashore (it also skips a state as part of it is also in Mississippi) was Worth's annual beach trip as a child, and it's the place she credits with making her want to be a park ranger. ""I saw my dad going to work in a uniform but I didn't get it,"" she says. ""It was the junior ranger program (at Gulf Island) where I fell in love with the idea of being a park ranger (when I was 6).  I just loved it."" Gulf Islands is an ""amazing untouched beach park, where I feel like I'm on a real Florida beach that hasn't been manufactured or plowed flat,"" she says. ""It's also a neat historical park with fortifications on the islands"" dating back nearly 150 years to the Spanish. What's your favorite national park and why?

"A federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, has ordered the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make the morning-after birth control pill available to people of any age without a prescription. The order overturned a 2011 decision by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to require a prescription for girls under 17. The FDA said it couldn't comment on an ongoing legal matter. But the U.S. Justice Department indicated an appeal of the ruling was under consideration. ""The Department of Justice is reviewing the appellate options and expects to act promptly,"" department spokeswoman Allison Price said. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended last year that oral contraceptives be sold over the counter in an effort to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in the United States. Opponents of prescription requirements say prescriptions can delay access to the drug. In 2011, Teva Women's Health Inc., maker of Plan B One-Step, had asked the FDA to make the drug available without prescription to all sexually active girls and women. Sebelius overruled the FDA's recommendation, saying, ""I do not believe enough data were presented to support the application."" On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman said in his order, ""The decisions of the Secretary with respect to Plan B One-Step and that of the FDA with respect to the Citizen Petition, which it had no choice but to deny, were arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable."" Friday's order came in response to a lawsuit launched by the Center for Reproductive Rights. The group was seeking to expand access to all brands of the morning-after pill over the counter, such as Plan B One-Step and Next Choice, so that women of all ages would be able to purchase them without a prescription. ""Today science has finally prevailed over politics,"" Nancy Northup, the center's president and CEO, said in a statement. ""This landmark court decision has struck a huge blow to the deep-seated discrimination that has for too long denied women access to a full range of safe and effective birth control methods."" In a press briefing, Northup said that according to the order, within 30 days, the pill would be available over the counter without ""point of sale restrictions,"" such as needing to show identification or being a certain age. There may be other settings besides drugstores where the morning-after pill will be sold, Susan Wood, associate professor at the George Washington University's School of Public Health and Health Services, told reporters. ""We no longer have to find, on a Sunday morning or a Saturday night, an open pharmacy counter with a pharmacist on duty,"" she said. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine also supported the decision, applauding the stance that ""science should guide policy."" But other groups, including the Family Research Council, expressed concerns about the order. ""There is a real danger that Plan B may be given to young girls, under coercion or without their consent. The involvement of parents and medical professionals act as a safeguard for these young girls.  However, today's ruling removes these common-sense protections,"" Anna Higgins, director of the organization's Center for Human Dignity, said in a statement. Bill Donohue of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights also disagreed with the ruling, citing what he sees as a ""contempt shown for parental rights."" ""A 12-year-old girl in a New York City school cannot be given an aspirin by her teacher, even if she has a fever. The same girl cannot buy a large soda during lunchtime because Mayor Michael Bloomberg has decreed that it is not good for her. But she can be given a pill, unbeknownst to her parents, that could arguably abort her baby,"" he said in a statement. The FDA approved Plan B in 1999. The key ingredient in Plan B is a synthetic hormone called levonorgestrel. This drug stops an egg from being released from the ovary, or preventing fertilization of the egg by sperm. If there has been fertilization, Plan B may prevent a fertilized egg from embedding in the uterus. But if the egg has already been implanted in the uterus, the morning-after pill will not work. Emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours. Many developed countries require a prescription for oral contraceptives, including Canada and most of Europe, but other countries sell the pill without a prescription even formally or informally. A 2012 study in the journal Pediatrics found that there is misinformation about emergency contraception, including about what age women can obtain it without a prescription, and who can take it in general. As far as pricing, the morning-after pill goes for about $50, said Susannah Baruch, interim president and CEO of Reproductive Health Technologies Project.","NEW: Justice Department ""reviewing the appellate options,"" spokeswoman says .

"The grizzly bears that claim this park as their home demand respect. They're emblems of a tough and inspiring untamed wilderness. So is the Teton Range, which rises 7,000 feet above the valley at Jackson Hole, amazing and humbling the day trippers and overnight campers who come to visit Wyoming's expansive Grand Teton National Park. While Grand Teton is the highest peak at 13,770 feet, there are eight peaks more than 12,000 feet in elevation. The forested mountainsides provide some relief to summer hikers. The current-day park has existed since 1950, when Grand Teton National Park (created in 1929) and Jackson Hole National Monument (created in 1943) were combined under the Grand Teton name. In 1972, the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway was established and is now managed by the park staff. Park stats: Grand Teton National Park is the eighth most visited National Park in the country with 2.7 million visitors last year. (Great Smoky Mountains National Park came in first place with 9.7 million visitors.) The park's boundaries encompass 310,000 acres or 485 square miles. Summer in the Park: Great Smoky Mountains National Park . The location: Grand Teton is located north of the town of Jackson and south of Yellowstone National Park in northwestern Wyoming. If you go: A seven-day permit ($25 per vehicle or $12 per hiker/bicyclist) allows access to both Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. The five developed campgrounds within the park charge $20.50 per night for a site, with limits ranging from seven to 14 days. Meet our ranger: In 1993 Brian Bergsma worked a summer job at Isle Royale National Park in Michigan to pay for college. He got hooked on the national parks.  The next summer, he decided he wanted bigger mountains, so he went to work at Grand Teton. Although he was first hired permanently at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, he finally made it back to Grand Teton in 2000.  He worked for eight years as a ""Trail Dawg"" crew member (and later, 10 years as a trail crew supervisor), building and clearing hiking trails and building log and steel bridges and stone retaining walls by hand. The crews would sometimes hike 30 miles a day, carrying and using cross cuts, chainsaws and other equipment. He's served as the park's safety and occupational health manager for the past two years. Camping: Horror or bliss? For a day trip, don't miss:  Cascade Canyon. ""There are often several large bull moose in the canyon, and during spring and after storms many waterfalls cascade down the canyon sides,"" Bergsma says. ""The views of the peaks are constantly changing also, and it is right by Jenny Lake, the most popular place in the park and readily accessible."" If you have a little more time and want a challenging hike, Bergsma recommends an overnight hike of Cascade and Paintbrush canyons. It's a nearly 20-mile loop that includes a 4,000-foot gain in elevation. (You'll need a backcountry permit, which are available first-come, first-served for the rest of this season.) In addition to the wonders of the day hike, you'll see ""some amazing sunsets and incredibly clear and vivid star-gazing,"" he says. ""It's not for the faint of heart, but it blows me away, and I've hiked all over the world."" Favorite less-traveled spot: Grandview Point trail and summit. ""It is less busy than many other areas of the park, has great views of the Tetons and the forest to the east and is a relatively short hike,"" he says. ""It is densely forested, too, so it's good for shade on a hot summer day."" It's just 0.7 miles from the trailhead to the summit and a 4-mile loop, but Bergsma warns that the steep 15% grade can be tough on the knees. Favorite spot to view wildlife: Bergsma recommends Moose-Wilson Road because of the plentiful moose and beavers and, increasingly, grizzly bears. (It's occasionally closed because of the grizzlies.) He also likes the Jackson Lake Junction to Oxbow bend section of the outer highway for grizzly bears, pelicans, elk and beaver. Most magical moment in the park:  His first day of work at Grand Teton, as a summer employee. ""Driving to Grand Teton at 2 a.m. for my first day of work in May of 1994, I was blown away at the night sky and all the stars. On the first day of work, I built horse pasture fences all day surrounded by bison and had no sunscreen. I was totally fried by the end of the day. Blisters, sunburn and bison: It was the best first day ever."" Favorite other park to visit: Capitol Reef National Park in Utah. ""It's great for hiking and canyoneering, for off-trail exploration and for the incredibly beautiful rocks,"" Bergsma says. ""The waterfalls after a storm are amazing. It's just like Zion National Park (another favorite) but a little more remote so there aren't as many people."" What's your favorite national park and why?

"(CNN) -- The ability to share images and thoughts instantly is one of the marvels of the Information Age. Most of us, thanks to Facebook, have a relationship to a social network that involves a stream of conversation (albeit often banal: ""I'm making chicken. ..."" Really?) But more than conversation, our profiles usually include photos and  sometimes YouTube video sharing -- and not just ones of Charlie Sheen sounding off, but also home movies of little Annie's ballet recital or Grant's first ski run. Much has been publicized about how important it is for parents to monitor their kids' use of technology, but what are the guidelines for parents of small children? When children are not old enough to read, write, talk or press ""upload,"" is it inappropriate for us to post their photos on the Web? As usual, I am of two minds. I love staying connected to friends, and will occasionally post photos on Facebook, but I rarely put my kids' photos on the Web or my blog. Yet, I notice a lot of blogs seem to be nothing but family photos. Also, I am not sure why I draw a distinction, especially when Facebook has been under scrutiny about its privacy policies. Then, I wondered, what about allowing your kids to be on TV? Or in print? Is there a difference? Is there an actual danger in having their images out there? I decided to poll some parents to hear their views. A 42-year-old mother of three, who wanted to preserve her family's privacy, not surprisingly does not even have a Facebook page. She said, ""I feel like Facebook is so voyeuristic and putting my children's photos on there is me making a decision for them when it can affect them for the rest of their lives. I put my photos on Mobile Me and send my family the link that way."" I asked her if she felt posting photos on Facebook was a real danger to her kids, and she said she believed, ""It could be, but to me, it is more of an ethical decision."" Mary Kay, mother of two, has no issue having her kids' photos on the Web. Even her personal profile photo on Facebook is a family shot. She also posts individual photos of them on her Facebook page. When I asked her if she thinks this could pose a threat to her kids, she said, ""No I don't. Maybe I am ignorant, but I don't worry about it.""  She also went on to say that she likes to think people are good. Then she added, ""Then again, our house did get broken into two weeks ago."" (She was not relating this to her Facebook practices, but instead acknowledging she was an optimist when characterizing humanity.) She also didn't believe it was a big deal to have her kids posted on YouTube. Michael, on the other hand, father of two, is ""creeped,"" out by having his kids' images on Facebook or the Web, yet his wife, Stephanie, does use Facebook to keep in touch with their family miles away. She said, ""As long as you use your privacy settings, and (have) location services shut off, I don't have a huge problem with it."" I wondered what I would hear from people who were high profile or had a bit of celebrity standing. I talked to mom blogger Jessica Gottlieb, who has a large Internet following. She never posts photos of her kids on the Web. She believes her ""children are entitled to make their own first impression."" Being their friend on Facebook takes this opportunity away. She also said she feels, ""Mom blogs are Disneyland for pedophiles."" A mid-30s father of two is shooting a reality television show about his company and his family life. (He is not permitted to discuss specifics about the show until it airs.) When asked how he felt about having his kids be part of a TV show, he said, ""At first we (he and his wife) were against it."" He noted there are some reality TV shows in which he feels the kids are exploited; cameras follow kids around all day and the kids are used as trophies. He feels he and his wife are making a show that realistically portrays the juggle of balancing family and work, and will shed insights on that struggle. The show he is involved in is not about the kids, so he has let go of his misgivings about it. So, some parents think it is no big deal, some feel it is dangerous. How about the experts? What's their take? I spoke with Nancy McBride, national safety director for the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. She would like parents to be aware that posting their kids' photos online does pose ""a potential risk."" She added she does not want people to be unduly alarmed, but urges parents, ""Make sure only trusted people in their lives have access to your photos."" In a statement on the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children's resource guide, the advice is: ""There is no particular way to prevent your uploaded images from being copied, saved and used by other individuals online. The only way to ensure that no one is using and saving your images is to avoid uploading them to the Internet."" I spoke with Pattie Fitzgerald, child advocate and founder of Safely Ever After, an organization in Santa Monica, California, dedicated to children's safety. I asked about Facebook, specifically. She said, ""I have not heard of any parents with young children being stalked because they saw pictures of kids on someone's Facebook page."" Still, she urged caution, adding, ""It is very easy for information to wind up in the wrong hands."" She said it is far more common ""for tweens to create a Facebook page, lie about their age, post provocative photos and profiles that are not private, tag their names and very easily become accessible."" We all have various degrees of comfort when it comes to privacy on the Internet, as we do in the other parts of our lives. We have different lenses through which we view the world, and styles from which we parent. Some people are afraid of flying, others of terrorist attacks. Some are able to, or chose to, live without fear. My friend George, who is afraid of many things, is not afraid of flying. His theory is, if the plane goes down, it's not his fault. But, if our responsibility as parents is to protect our kids, then we need to be conscious of the fact that the Web is a public forum. We need to remember that like innocence lost, once you post it, you can never get it back. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lee Rose Emery.","Author: Is there an actual danger in having images of your kids online?

"Presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin notes that one of the things that's so special about the State of the Union address is the spectacle of the entire government -- the heads of all three branches -- gathering in one room at the same time. ""There is something about that ritual and the hunger we all have for that oneness that makes it really unique,"" Goodwin tells CNN. ""And there is a sense in which the ceremony -- the excitement of seeing the Supreme Court justices, seeing the Congress, seeing the president -- reminds us of some of the pageantry that we all look for in our government."" Here are eight State of the Union address moments that Goodwin finds particularly memorable: . 2010: Obama and Alito clash over campaign finance . When President Barack Obama criticized the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United, the camera showed Justice Samuel Alito shaking his head and suggesting what Obama was saying was not true. It became a big thing. Some people thought it was rude of the president to say that. Others wondered whether Alito's reaction had to do with the fact that Obama had been a leader against his nomination. Before television, obviously you didn't have to worry if you looked bored or if you were shaking your head or whether you looked like you were disdainful. But now, especially after that moment, everybody realized, ""I'd better watch my face, as well as what I'm saying, because the camera is there and the audio is there."" By the numbers: State of the Union addresses . 2002: ""Axis of evil"" In the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush went before the Congress and defined the ""axis of evil,"" meaning Iran, Iraq and North Korea. In a sense, ""axis"" was such a loaded term, because the Axis powers of Italy, Germany and Japan aligned against the U.S. and its allies in World War II. So the idea that the world was now divided into ""axis"" powers and ""allied"" powers seemed to suggest a war coming on, which indeed was the truth. 1996: Clinton declares an end to big government . When Bill Clinton said the era of big government is over, he was referring to the Democrats' big midterm congressional losses in 1994, blamed in part on the failure of the big government health care bill that he sponsored. What he was signaling: ""I'm moving to the center, (and) the Democratic Party is moving to the center.""  He then went on that year to pass welfare reform, a Republican-sponsored idea. That made some liberals mad but ensuring in some ways his re-election. To go or not to go: Supreme Court at the address . 1986: A delay caused by tragedy . The 1986 State of the Union, delivered by Ronald Reagan, was the first one to be postponed as the Space Shuttle Challenger blew up shortly after lift-off on the day for which the speech was scheduled. Reagan had such a good sense of timing that he realized it was more important was to directly address the Challenger problem than to deliver the State of the Union. He gave a masterful, emotional and classy speech from the Oval Office that allowed him to become healer-in-chief, yet another role for the president of the United States. 1982: Lenny Skutnik steals the show . When Ronald Reagan turned to the House Gallery and recognized Lenny Skutnik as a hero for jumping into the waters of the Potomac River to help rescue the survivors of an airplane crash, it began a tradition that continues to this day. The first lady's box is now regularly peopled by ordinary citizens who have done extraordinary things. Sometimes the presidents use it as a human touch on their policies or sometimes as an emotional moment that makes the House and the Senate come together. These people are generally not partisan and are somebody that people can look up to at the same time. CNN's John King: Little will change in D.C. after speech . 1974: Defiant Nixon . Here was Nixon's approval rating at only 26%, and the House was already considering impeaching him for Watergate, and his voice was trembling. At one point, he meant to say that ""we must replace the discredited welfare system,"" but instead says that ""we must replace the discredited president.""  Then he declares one year of Watergate is enough. Some people said at the time that what was so incredible about that State of the Union address was that it was less about the state of the union and more about the state of the president -- here he is facing down the people who are beginning to think about his impeachment, and he has to stand before them in that assembly. State of the Union firsts . 1964: LBJ declares war on poverty . In Lyndon B. Johnson's first State of the Union, only two months after the assassination of JFK, he called for an unconditional war on poverty, a whole set of interrelated programs involving health care, urban centers Appalachia and more. What he said at the time was that he wanted something to be his own program, something that hadn't been started by any other president. Poverty was the thing that hit him emotionally, that he always wanted to do something about, so this became his signature program. It's incredible that within such short time of JFK's assassination, he came up with a vision or a whole series of legislative programs that would eventually become fact. Highlights from past addresses . 1941: FDR's Four Freedoms . One of the best remembered moments is the declaration of the ""Four Freedoms"" in Franklin Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union -- the freedom from want, the freedom from fear, the freedom of speech and the freedom of worship. It became memorialized in Norman Rockwell's famous paintings and offered a standard by which other countries would be judged.  It still provides hope for those countries where those freedoms are not assured. Another important note from that State of the Union is that FDR called for the Lend-Lease act for Britain, which was then at war with Germany. At a time when our country was still isolationist, eventually Lend-Lease passed, proving that we had educated the country to the need to do something even before Pearl Harbor brought us into the war. Eleanor Roosevelt, in a very rare lapse of judgment, was upset that during the discussion of the Four Freedoms and Lend-Lease, the Republicans did not clap and  sat on their hands. She said she felt that they were just little kids, saying, ""I don't want to play in your yard.  I don't love you anymore."" She then got roundly criticized -- and rightly so -- by Republicans, who said, ""What does she think she is, the queen?  And he is the king?  And we are not allowed to criticize them?""

"The Eiffel Tower. The Colosseum. The Taj Majal. The Pyramids. Massive architectural marvels from times past, they are often stopping points on a tourist's journey. Although these grand sites aren't always why globe-trotters say they're going on vacation, some of history's great works of architecture star in the returning traveler's photos. Did you get that smiling shot in front of Buckingham Palace or the photo ""pushing"" the Leaning Tower of Pisa upright? Despite a tight economy, a new generation of architects is giving the traveler reasons to jump on a plane to see modern masterpieces. Many of the new structures are public projects, designed to welcome the resident and tourist alike. ""There's been a lot of emphasis on public architecture, using it to really bring vitality to a place,"" says Justin Davidson, New York magazine's architecture and classical music critic. ""Whether people are traveling a great distance to see one thing or it's creating a market for the regeneration of a place that really needs it, those things get merged."" Here are six great spots for ogling modern marvels: . New World Symphony (Miami Beach). The New World Symphony, which brought vitality to Miami Beach's Lincoln Road when it moved into the Lincoln Theater many years ago, is having the same impact at its new location nearby. The symphony, which prepares graduates of major music schools for roles in leading orchestras around the world, hired architect Frank Gehry to design its $160 million New World Center campus in collaboration with symphony founder and artistic director Michael Tilson Thomas. The campus, which hosted its inaugural concert in January 2011, has an adjacent 2.5-acre public space designed by Dutch architecture firm West 8. Free and affordable events are often scheduled at the outdoor space. For the architecture geek: Miami Beach is also attracting the world's architects to its parking structures. Noted architect Zaha Hadid was recently selected to design a municipal garage. She follows on the heels of New World Center architect Gehry, Mexican architect Enrique Norten and Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, all with innovative parking garages in Miami Beach. Natural History Museum of Utah (Salt Lake City). Appearing to be hewn out of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, the Natural History Museum of Utah's new $140 million Rio Tinto Center looks like Utah. Unlike designers of many natural history museums in urban locations, Ennead Architects and GSBG Architects could take advantage of the 17-acre site's location at the edge of Salt Lake City. The building is above ancient Lake Bonneville's shoreline, with the Bonneville Shoreline Trail cutting through the site. For the architecture geek: Tucked away in a Salt Lake City block behind homes and businesses, Gilgal Sculpture Garden is one of the city's best-kept secret treasures. Dating back to the late 1940s and designed by Thomas Battersby Child Jr., a contractor and former bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ""it's a funky and relatively obscure public sculpture garden located in Salt Lake that has many fans among architects and University of Utah students,"" says Bob Herman, a local architect and past president of the Utah Center for Architecture. Times Square, the High Line and more (New York). Since the banishment of vehicular traffic from parts of Time Square, the neon and digital people ""have gone nuts"" with signage in Times Square. It creates an almost performance art-like scene for the pedestrians taking a break from their walks, says Bloomberg Media architecture critic James Russell. After a walk through Times Square, head south to an innovative urban park built atop an unused elevated train line in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. The High Line has been a hit since it opened in phases over the past three years. Unencumbered by moving vehicles or traffic lights, landscape architect James Corner Field Operations and the architecture firm of Diller Scofidio + Renfro designed a garden oasis above the hustle and bustle of the West Side. For the architecture geek: Continue downtown to 8 Spruce St., where New York by Gehry (another Gehry design) is reportedly the tallest residential structure in the Western Hemisphere. ""It has a rippling stainless steel façade, and it's near Brooklyn, so you can walk across the Brooklyn Bridge to see it,"" Russell says. ""The other side is the Brooklyn Bridge Park, which is an absolutely stunning place to be in and from which to look at Manhattan."" Landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburgh designed the park. Clyfford Still Museum (Denver). After gaining national fame and attention for his work into the 1940s, abstract expressionist artist Clyfford Still withdrew from the commercial art world and kept most of his work rather than selling it. Although his work was discussed along with peers such as Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock, he shunned the public eye. He died in 1980, and his will stipulated that his estate be given to an American city that would create a permanent space solely for studying and exhibiting his work. Denver accepted the challenge; Brad Cloepfil of Allied Works Architecture designed the structure, and the Clyfford Still Museum opened in November. The museum houses 94% of the artist's known work, most of which has never been on public display before now. With a series of skylights designed to bring in natural light to illuminate the collection, ""the quality of light in this museum is one of the best I've ever seen,"" Russell says. For the architecture geek: After visiting the Still museum, look beyond the art to appreciate the Denver Art Museum's 2006 addition by noted architect Daniel Libeskind, who famously won the World Trade Center design competition. There is a daily architecture tour at 1 p.m. Oslo Opera House (Norway). Part of a redevelopment project to reconnect the cutoff waterfront to the rest of the city, the Oslo Opera House has an incredible amount of public space that allows people to walk up the outside of the structure to its rooftop plaza. The building, which houses the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, was designed by the internationally renowned Norwegian architecture firm Snøhetta. It opened in 2008. If you'd like to attend any of the artistic performances, make sure to purchase tickets in advance online. For the architecture geek: If you think the outside of the Oslo Opera House would be an excellent skate park, it's no accident. Skateboarders were consulted about the exterior design and surfaces and have enjoyed the results, according to Wired magazine. The magazine lists some suggested moves. Parque Biblioteca España (Medellín, Colombia). For the adventurous architecture traveler, try visiting Medellín, Colombia, where a renaissance in design and infrastructure is taking place. Former Medellín Mayor Sergio Fajardo made the development of public architecture to revitalize poor areas and connect them to the rest of the city a central tenet of his administration. ""Our most beautiful buildings must be in our poorest areas,"" Fajardo has frequently said. Designed by architect Giancarlo Mazzanti of Bogota, Parque Biblioteca España, in the Medellín neighborhood of Santo Domingo, is the most famous of a half-dozen libraries designed with park space in the city. Along with improvements in roads and schools, the city has built a system of gondola-like public transit to transport residents of the poorest hillside communities down to the city's public rail system. Although Medellín is much safer than it was during the height of the drug wars, check with local officials and the U.S. State Department before heading to Santo Domingo. The libraries are part of the city's commitment to its poorest residents. ""It represents an investment in the whole urban fabric, using culture, architecture and design to improve people's lives and connect them to transit, architecture and culture,"" says Davidson, the New York magazine critic. ""It's a showy piece of new architecture that represents something broader that a place is trying to accomplish. One building does not do that in isolation.""","New World Symphony offers free and reduced price music at new Miami Beach campus .

"Yosemite National Park has almost everything a nature lover could desire: Glorious waterfalls, spectacular meadows and valleys, groves of ancient sequoias and the wildlife that call the park home. Of course, Half Dome looms large for visitors. Each year, thousands of seasoned hikers make it to the summit 8,800 feet above sea level, climbing the last 400 feet on metal cables installed to allow hikers to reach the peak without rock climbing gear. The round trip takes most hikers 10 to 12 hours and permits are required. But as seasonal ranger Kirsten Randolph can attest, the park offers many stunning settings beyond this granite dome. Yosemite National Park exists because President Abraham Lincoln signed a bill creating the Yosemite Land Grant on June 30, 1864. The legislation, which included Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias, marks the first time the federal government had set aside a piece of land purely for preservation. That act is generally believed to mark the worldwide birth of the national parks idea. Yosemite National Park was officially created in 1890, although the Valley and Mariposa Grove were still managed by the state of California at that time. These two areas were ceded to the federal government in 1906, creating the park much as it exists today. Summer in the park: Great Smoky Mountains National Park . Park stats: Yosemite National Park is the third most visited national park in the country with 3.8 million visitors last year (behind Great Smoky Mountains and Grand Canyon national parks). The park encompasses nearly 1,200 square miles. The location: The Sierra Nevada mountain range in eastern California. If you go: The park entrance fee is $20 per private car, van, pickup or RV. The fee is $10 a person if arriving on foot, horseback, bicycle, motorcycle or noncommercial bus. Visitors 15 and younger can enter for free. Campground fees vary and reservations for campgrounds that require them go fast and are strongly recommended. Meet our ranger: Park ranger Randolph didn't grow up watching television or playing video games. Instead, Randolph played outside with her sister and family in Spokane, Washington, visiting Olympic National Park and other national parks for their vacations. ""I thought how neat it would be to live and work in a national park someday,"" said Randolph, 26. ""The rangers at all the parks seemed to be pretty cool."" She started at Yosemite as an intern, working on young visitor programming. After interning and volunteering for a full year, she got hired as a seasonal park ranger. She doesn't see herself leaving anytime soon. ""Yosemite provides a unique opportunity to enjoy nature and wildlife and have interaction with visitors,"" she says. ""I love witnessing how a first-time visitor connects with this place."" Summer in the park: Grand Teton National Park . For a day trip, don't miss: Cook's Meadow. You can take the one-mile Cook's Meadow Loop through the meadow. Then make make your way to the base of Yosemite Falls on the Lower Yosemite Fall Trail. Take a drive to see the iconic view at Glacier Point to see how large Yosemite is and catch an impressive view of Half Dome. During the summer, drive along Tioga Road, where the habitat is very different  because you're so high in elevation. Head into one of the sequoia groves, such as Mariposa Grove or the less visited Tuolumne or Merced groves. Favorite less-traveled spot: Take the free park shuttle to stop 16 (at Happy Isles) and walk to a marshy meadow called the Fen. ""There's a little bit of a spring underneath that keeps it green all year round,"" says Randolph. ""It's possible to see wildlife all year around this green meadow near Glacier Point."" Favorite spot to view wildlife: Cook's Meadow is where Randolph saw her first bear on the job and where she spotted a rare Virginia rail bird.  Even though it's in the middle of everything, ""animals are still drawn to it around sunset or at night,"" she says. ""Our wildlife don't like to be out in the hot sun any more than we do."" 7 stunning spots for U.S. wildlife . Most magical moment in the park: No surprise that it's Cook's Meadow (again) for this ranger: Two months ago, that's where her fiance, a park law enforcement officer, proposed to her in the lush green grasses growing in spring. ""Yosemite Falls and Half Dome were in the background,"" she says. Favorite other park to visit: Pinnacles National Park (California). Set aside as a national monument by Theodore Roosevelt in 1908, Pinnacles National Monument was elevated to become the nation's 59th national park (and California's ninth national park) on February 11, 2013. If you visit, you might see endangered California condors, as Randolph did when she and her fiance went camping there last fall. That's because the 27,000-acre park is home to 63 California condors and is one of four condor release sites in the country. What is your favorite national park or national park site and why?

"Walter White, the high school chemistry teacher turned meth dealer in the fictional TV series ""Breaking Bad,"" would seem to have little in common with the real-life President Lyndon B. Johnson, who played a celebrated part in the passage of the Civil Rights Act 50 years ago. Yet Bryan Cranston, who played White and now stars as LBJ in a Broadway play, sees a common thread: ""They're both very powerful, strong-willed, smart and damaged. In both cases, ego had a large part of what downfall they had,"" Cranston said when I questioned him in a recent panel discussion. Last week, I had the pleasure of taking a group of 50 Princeton students to the new Broadway play ""All The Way,"" starring Cranston as Johnson. Written by the Pulitzer Prize-winning Robert Schenkkan, the play is a riveting portrait of one of the most important and controversial presidents in American history. Besides great entertainment, ""All the Way"" also offers an excellent opportunity to think about some of the lessons we need to include in our civic education to younger Americans, some of the aspects of politics that often elude the textbooks. Among those lessons: . Insider politics can be good: The era of insider politics had its virtues. In Johnson's time, politicians came to Washington for most of their career, spending their adult lives in the city and displaying a true passion for the political process. This is difficult to understand in the post-Watergate landscape, when most elected officials spend their time railing against Washington, trying as hard as possible to have as little do with Capitol Hill as possible. While many put  down former President Jimmy Carter, most politicians still try to replicate the anti-politics campaign style that he perfected in 1976, where his major selling point was not being part of Washington's broken system. As a result of fundraising and cheap air travel, more politicians spend their time outside of the district or inside the halls of events filled with wealthy donors from whom they're trying to raise another buck. Distrust in government is healthy and skepticism about Washington is well-deserved, but there was also something important about an era like the 1950s and 1960s when our nation's leaders lived and breathed the institutions of government. In a long career in Washington, Johnson developed close relationships with other members of Congress and gained an intimate knowledge of all the issues, the history, and the arcane procedures that gave character to the city. His longstanding relationship with Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen, with whom he had worked closely throughout the 1950s when LBJ was Senate majority leader, enabled negotiations over civil rights to move forward. Politics and policy are connected: Too often these days, politics is a dirty word. Television shows like ""Scandal,"" ""Homeland"" and ""House of Cards"" all present politics as a power game replete with maneuvering and manipulation.   (Sometimes life actually imitates art. Last week the House of Representatives took a ""House of Cards""-style vote. When a bill looked like it was going to face defeat, the House Republicans pulled the bill from the floor and members went back to their offices, waiting to hear what would come next. While they waited, leaders from both parties sneakily brought the bill back to the floor for a quick vote. The bill passed as most members sat in their office having no idea what was taking place.) But ""All the Way"" is a powerful reminder that politicians often use their ambition and ruthless drive for power productively. It might make you ""squeamish,"" Cranston tells the audience in the final scene of the play, but this is how new policies are born. LBJ is as manipulative as any character in ""House of Cards,"" obsessing over power and willing to twist arms as far as they could go without breaking. But Schenkann captures something essential about LBJ and his allies on Capitol Hill: namely, that often power-craving politicians use that ambition toward higher ends. The process is ugly, confusing, and messy. But in this case the product is something magnificent. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a ""big f-ing deal,"" in the words that our current vice president, Joe Biden, used to describe President Barack Obama's health care reform. When all was said and done, the Civil Rights Act ended the system of racial segregation that had defined public life in the South since the end of Reconstruction. Politics is about compromise: In today's political environment, compromise is a dirty word. We don't value leaders who adjust their positions in the pursuit of cutting deals, dismissing them as flip-floppers and sellouts. ""All the Way"" is about the necessity of compromise to keep things moving. Johnson, as well as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. agree to huge compromises that anger their supporters -- including civil rights leaders and Vice President Hubert Humphrey -- by, for example, agreeing to exclude voting rights from the legislation. At one point, Cranston's Johnson explains, ""This is not about principle. It's about votes!"" The costs of presidential hubris: Although the play focuses on the Civil Rights Act and election of 1964, the seeds of Johnson's destruction are planted in the early discussions of Vietnam surrounding the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in August 1964, when Johnson's political fears of a right-wing backlash (against a president who might be depicted as refusing to stand firm against communism) led him deeper into the mire of Vietnam. Even as Humphrey warns Johnson against getting deeply involved in the faraway conflict, Johnson, at the height of his influence, is confident that he will be able to contain it. This is one of the lessons of presidential history that is too often forgotten. We see again and again, especially in the realm of foreign policy, how presidents from both parties can go too far, believing they know best and insisting they can avoid the mistakes of their predecessors. Their decisions ultimately damage their legacy and the nation. Sometimes popular culture doesn't have much to offer for the real world. But ""All the Way"" is a great history lesson for voters and politicians who are concerned about the quality of America's civic life.","Bryan Cranston sees the destructive role of ego in stories of LBJ and fictional Walter White .

"The man on the voicemail is flirty and clearly asking for a date. But it's the name on the message that's raising red flags. ""Hi, it's your newly favorite congressman, Bob Filner. You know, the one who fell in love with you at your last speech,"" he told Eldonna Fernandez. He also asked her out to dinner in the message. ""I don't want to wait 'til you come back to have dinner with you,"" he said. That message was left a year ago, while Filner was serving his 10th term as a U.S. congressman. He had met Fernandez at a National Women's Veterans Association of America ""Healing and Hiring Fair."" When Fernandez got the message, she immediately deleted it. But when sexual harassment allegations against the now-San Diego mayor began to surface a few weeks ago, she remembered the ""creepy"" message and was surprised to find it still sitting in her iPhone's voicemail trash. ""Ugh. It creeps me out, it creeps me out,"" Fernandez said. ""The guy's got problems."" But the unwanted voicemail isn't the real problem for Fernandez. It's where and to whom he made inappropriate advances. Dogged by sex scandal, Filner to enter counseling . Fernandez, along with Army veteran Gerri Tindley, joins 11 other women who have publicly accused Filner, 70, of making unwanted advances, from groping to verbal passes. They are also among at least eight female veterans and members of the National Women's Veterans Association of America (NWVAA) in San Diego who have made accusations against the mayor. Almost all of the women say they were victims of sexual assault while they were in the military. The women, like Fernandez, say the former chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee used his significant power and credentials to access military sexual assault survivors, who they say are less likely to complain. Fernandez is a retired master sergeant from the Air Force. She served 23 years in the United States and was deployed to the Middle East after 9/11. Secrets that women of San Diego no longer keep about its mayor . She said she was raped three times during her service. Like many victims of military sexual assault and rape, she suffered in silence, believing the system would never support her. In civilian life, Fernandez now speaks openly about her assaults and is an active member of the NWVAA, which supports victims of military sexual assault. Fernandez was speaking at an NWVAA event in August 2012 when she exchanged business cards with Filner. ""He looks at my card. He looks at me. He says, 'Fernandez. Are you married? Do you have a husband?' Very quick, very direct. I said, 'No, I'm divorced.' 'Well, you're beautiful, and I can't take my eyes off you, and I want to take you to dinner.' I was really shocked and I was like, 'Uh, OK,'"" Fernandez said. Then came the phone call and voicemail, which Fernandez never returned. Nurse accuses mayor of sexual harassment in his office . Another veteran: Filner was rubbing me . At the same NWVAA event where Fernandez spoke, Army vet Tindley gave a speech about her violent rape, which she said happened during her eight years of service. She bore a son from the sexual assault. Filner, who was running for mayor of San Diego at the time, was also scheduled to speak. In the green room, he asked Tindley about her rape. ""He got as close as he could to me. His jacket was touching my jacket,"" Tindley said. ""I was bent down. He was bent down with me, rubbing like he cared, like he was consoling me."" Tindley said she felt uncomfortable as Filner moved closer and closer. So close, she said, that she nearly fell off the couch trying to move away from him. ""I felt very weird,"" she said. When asked if she said anything, Tindley replied, ""What am I gonna say? You're a congressman. What am I gonna say to you? What am I gonna say to his man? Can he destroy my life, can he stop me from moving forward?"" Lawyer: Mayor never got harassment training . A series of complaints . Three weeks ago, as women began to step forward to reveal instances of sexual harassment, the veterans at the NWVAA began to compare notes. Tara Jones, the president of the group, said she's spoken to seven to eight women who had varying encounters with Filner at the women's veteran events, from groping to unwanted requests for dates. ""He went to dinners, asked women out to dinners, grabbed breasts, buttocks. The full gamut. Everything that is complete violation of what we stand for,"" Jones said. ""He's a sexual predator. And he used this organization for his own personal agenda."" Jones, who says she was raped while she was in the Navy, formed the NWVAA as a safe haven for military sexual assault victims. She invited Filner into her group, lavishing praise on his service to veterans while he was a congressman in Washington. She even stumped for him as he campaigned to be San Diego's mayor. Jones remembers Filner's speeches, where he has often called for a zero tolerance of sexual abuse in the armed forces. She said she feels not only outrage but also a deep and familiar sense of being victimized by a man of power. ""He preyed upon people who were vulnerable, who he knew nine times out of 10 would not speak up, that didn't have enough strength in them to speak up,"" she said. ""It's not OK. You need to not be in office. You need to be out of office. You need to not have the ability to prey on others."" That's a sentiment that Fernandez shares. ""We're all victims of military sexual assault. It appears to me that he was targeting the organization and hitting on the women of this organization because they were easy prey,"" Fernandez said. ""He's part of an organization that's against sexual assault and sexual violence against women and sexual harassment. And he's doing the very thing that we are fighting to make stop in our service and in our country."" Tindley questioned why Filner was in public office. ""How can you be a representative, take an oath, and be a predator? Do you know how damaging that is for women who are truly victims of military sexual trauma or rape in general? Who can we trust to help us?"" she asked. Filner checked into a two-week therapy program Monday to help him deal with his behavior. Calls to his spokeswoman were unreturned. Lee Burdick, Filner's chief of staff, dodged CNN's questions and would not answer to the latest allegations from the female veterans. Filner's attorney Harvey Berger had no comment.

"(CNN) -- The year was 2002, and group of young editors was trying to decide how risky it would be to put the United States soccer team on the June cover of ESPN Magazine. It was a tough call for a magazine that had gotten off to a spectacular start serving up a strictly meat-and-potatoes diet of NFL, with a side of baseball (Homerun Derby Only, please.) or NBA mixed in. But seriously, Landon Donovan, Demarcus Beasley, Clint Mathis? They were the backbone of Team USA in 2002 and the guys we wanted on the cover. Sure, they are all household names now -- at least for sports fans -- but back then we wondered: ""How many real sports fans even know these guys?"" You see, 12 years ago, talking anything but NFL or baseball with diehard sports fans in the U.S. would get you laughed out of the room. Soccer (never futbol) was considered a fringe sport -- a game mostly played and left behind in grade school. And certainly putting a soccer team on the cover of a national sports magazine was bound to flop on the newsstands. But we went with it anyway, thinking it would be fun to change things up a little bit -- give our readers a surprise. Oh, how times have changed. Unless you have been locked in a dark closet this week, you know: America is in the grips of futbol fever. How can we tell? Back in 2002, the Men's World Cup match between the United States and South Korea was seen in an average of 1.36 million television homes -- the most-watched soccer telecast ever on ESPN2 at the time -- based on a 1.62 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research Data. This year, an average of 18.2 million Americans tuned in to ESPN to watch the World Cup game between the U.S. and Portugal, according to Nielsen numbers released by the network. That game also broke a record for the most-viewed U.S. match on Univision Deportes, with 6.5 million viewers. And NFL? Step aside: The U.S.-Portugal match posted the kind of numbers typically reserved for ""Monday Night Football."" Those MNF games averaged 13.6 million viewers last year, according to Nielsen numbers provided by ESPN. Who's driving this soccer obsession? The younger generations, encouraged by a few 40-something Gen-X parents. I'm no soccer mom, but given a choice, I'd much rather see my kid pick soccer than just about any other sport. It's safer, cheaper, and more diverse. And it's a true team sport. No one player is bigger than the team. Everyone plays and everyone has a chance to help the team win. But how did this new love affair with the game happen? How did the Sports Nation allow futbol to come onto our turf and take over? They've even stolen our name. Vince Howley, watching the U.S.-Germany game at a beachside bar in Costa Rica Thursday, thinks he knows: . ""Look, 40 years ago when I was growing up, we never even heard of Futbol in Boston. But then my family moved to California. There, all my sons played soccer. ""They were bored with baseball. Kids today want excitement. Baseball was slow. You needed a ton of equipment and a big field. But soccer was exciting. I started coaching and my family loved it. The game became our lives."" But not so fast Uncle Vince. Is soccer really ready to surpass the NFL as America' favorite sport? His younger nephew, Patrick Howley, thinks differently. Howley, who is a physical education teacher at James Hubert Blake High in Silver Springs, Maryland, agrees soccer has become the go-to sport for most young kids in America. He thinks it's the perfect sport for young people because it teaches the fundamentals of every sport: offense, defense, and spatial movements. But at least for now, football -- not futbol -- remains king. ""American Football will tough to overcome but I do know that soccer will continue to grow,"" says Howley, who has played and coached club soccer. ""All my students love the game and follow it on an international level. It's really neat to see."" This diehard sports fan is sold. I love futbol. It's fast, furious and fun. And it's a game that both boys and girls can excel at and enjoy. And as I travel the world this summer and walk into the local sports bar to watch the World Cup games, you can be sure that I am the loudest, proudest American in the house. Go USA!","In 2002 Roxanne Jones struggled over whether to put soccer on cover of ESPN magazine .

"Teenager Ye Meng Yuan didn't die when a plane crashed at San Francisco International Airport last July. She actually survived the impact, only to die minutes later after a fire truck ran over her. Now, newly released video suggests emergency workers saw Ye's injured body on the ground before she was fatally struck -- challenging earlier claims that she was accidentally run over because she may have been covered in firefighting foam. In the footage, one firefighter tried to stop an emergency vehicle racing toward the scene. ""Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop, stop! There's a body ... there's a body right there. Right in front of you,"" the firefighter told the driver. The video was captured on a camera attached to a firefighter's helmet and first aired by CBS. Another video from a fire truck shows a firefighter on the ground directing the truck around a victim, who was not covered in foam at the time. Ye, 16, was on her way to an American summer camp from her home in China. Justin Green, a lawyer for her family, said the video shows several firefighters saw her lying on the tarmac, but none ""did the basic step of checking if she was alive."" ""It's unthinkable,"" Green told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""It's unimaginable, because the first thing -- the first priority of the firefighters or any rescue personnel -- is saving lives, and the first step in triage is to take the pulse, check the respiration. That was never done."" A California coroner ruled that Ye was alive when flung from the plane but died of ""multiple blunt injuries that are consistent with being run over by a motor vehicle."" ""Those injuries she received, she was alive at the time,"" San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault said. Ye's parents have filed a gross negligence claim against the city and county of San Francisco, arguing that the emergency responders who spotted Ye on the ground ""failed to move her to a safe location, failed to mark her location; failed to protect her from moving vehicles in the vicinity of the aircraft where it was known that vehicles would be traveling; failed to alert commanders at the scene; and/or abandoned Ye Meng Yuan in a perilous location."" Green said the teenager's parents were devastated by her death. ""In China, they're really only supposed to have one child,"" he said. ""This was the family's only child, a girl who was a star student, who was the focus of their lives. Everything that they did was poured into this girl and her future, and that was taken away because of some terrible mistakes and inaction by the firefighters."" The San Francisco Fire Department declined comment on the video, citing the pending claim. But in July, Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White offered her department's ""condolonces and apologies"" to the Ye family. ""We're heartbroken,"" Hayes-White said. ""We're in the business of saving lives ... There's not a lot of words to describe how badly we feel about it."" No charges for firefighter who ran over Asiana crash survivor .

"Today marks the 508th anniversary of the death of Christopher Columbus. Everybody knows the story of Columbus, right? He was an Italian explorer from Genoa who set sail in 1492 to enrich the Spanish monarchs with gold and spices from the orient. Not quite. For too long, scholars have ignored Columbus' grand passion: the quest to liberate Jerusalem from the Muslims. During Columbus' lifetime, Jews became the target of fanatical religious persecution. On March 31, 1492, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella proclaimed that all Jews were to be expelled from Spain. The edict especially targeted the 800,000 Jews  who had never converted, and gave them four months to pack up and get out. The Jews who were forced to renounce Judaism and embrace Catholicism were known as ""Conversos,"" or converts. There were also those who feigned conversion, practicing Catholicism outwardly while covertly practicing Judaism, the so-called ""Marranos,"" or swine. Tens of thousands of Marranos were tortured by the Spanish Inquisition. They were pressured to offer names of friends and family members, who were ultimately paraded in front of crowds, tied to stakes and burned alive. Their land and personal possessions were then divvied up by the church and crown. Recently, a number of Spanish scholars, such as Jose Erugo, Celso Garcia de la Riega, Otero Sanchez and Nicholas Dias Perez, have concluded that Columbus was a Marrano, whose survival depended upon the suppression of all evidence of his Jewish background in face of the brutal, systematic ethnic cleansing. Columbus, who was known in Spain as Cristóbal Colón and didn't speak Italian, signed his last will and testament on May 19, 1506, and made five curious -- and revealing -- provisions. Two of his wishes -- tithe one-tenth of his income to the poor and provide an anonymous dowry for poor girls -- are part of Jewish customs. He also decreed to give money to a Jew who lived at the entrance of the Lisbon Jewish Quarter. On those documents, Columbus used a triangular signature of dots and letters that resembled inscriptions found on gravestones of Jewish cemeteries in Spain. He ordered his heirs to use the signature in perpetuity. According to British historian Cecil Roth's ""The History of the Marranos,"" the anagram was a cryptic substitute for the Kaddish, a prayer recited in the synagogue by mourners after the death of a close relative. Thus, Columbus' subterfuge allowed his sons to say Kaddish for their crypto-Jewish father when he died. Finally, Columbus left money to support the crusade he hoped his successors would take up to liberate the Holy Land. Estelle Irizarry, a linguistics professor at Georgetown University, has analyzed the language and syntax of hundreds of handwritten letters, diaries and documents of Columbus and concluded that the explorer's primary written and spoken language was Castilian Spanish.  Irizarry explains that 15th-century Castilian Spanish was the ""Yiddish"" of Spanish Jewry, known as ""Ladino."" At the top left-hand corner of all but one of the 13 letters written by Columbus to his son Diego contained the handwritten Hebrew letters bet-hei, meaning b'ezrat Hashem (with God's help). Observant Jews have for centuries customarily added this blessing to their letters. No letters to outsiders bear this mark, and the one letter to Diego in which this was omitted was one meant for King Ferdinand. In Simon Weisenthal's book, ""Sails of Hope,"" he argues that Columbus' voyage was motivated by a desire to find a safe haven for the Jews in light of their expulsion from Spain. Likewise, Carol Delaney, a cultural anthropologist at Stanford University, concludes that Columbus was a deeply religious man whose purpose was to sail to Asia to obtain gold in order to finance a crusade to take back Jerusalem and rebuild the Jews' holy Temple. In Columbus' day, Jews widely believed that Jerusalem had to be liberated and the Temple rebuilt for the Messiah to come. Scholars point to the date on which Columbus set sail as further evidence of his true motives. He was originally going to sail on August 2, 1492, a day that happened to coincide with the Jewish holiday of Tisha B'Av, marking the destruction of the First and Second Holy Temples of Jerusalem. Columbus postponed this original sail date by one day to avoid embarking on the holiday, which would have been considered by Jews to be an unlucky day to set sail. (Coincidentally or significantly, the day he set forth was the very day that Jews were, by law, given the choice of converting, leaving Spain, or being killed.) Columbus' voyage was not, as is commonly believed, funded by the deep pockets of Queen Isabella, but rather by two Jewish Conversos and another prominent Jew. Louis de Santangel and Gabriel Sanchez advanced an interest free loan of 17,000 ducats from their own pockets to help pay for the voyage, as did Don Isaac Abrabanel, rabbi and Jewish statesman. Indeed, the first two letters Columbus sent back from his journey were not to Ferdinand and Isabella, but to Santangel and Sanchez, thanking them for their support and telling them what he had found. The evidence seem to bear out a far more complicated picture of the man for whom our nation now celebrates a national holiday and has named its capital. As we witness bloodshed the world over in the name of religious freedom, it is valuable to take another look at the man who sailed the seas in search of such freedoms -- landing in a place that would eventually come to hold such an ideal at its very core.","Sunday marks the 508th anniversary of the death of Christopher Columbus .

"Prosecutor Jim Flaiz, upon learning Ohio school shooter T.J. Lane was going to make a statement in court Tuesday, told relatives of his victims to be prepared for something inflammatory. Lane's own lawyer told the court he urged his client not to make the type of statement that the attorney expected to be delivered. But no one could have fully foreseen the actions and words of Lane, who entered the courtroom and removed his blue button-down shirt while the judge and those in attendance took their seats. Lane, now 18, revealed a white T-shirt with the word ""killer"" written on it. The attire was similar to what he was wearing when arrested by police shortly after the February 27, 2012, killings at Chardon High School in northeastern Ohio. Given the opportunity to speak a few minutes later, Lane made an obscene gesture at the victims' families and spoke to them briefly, using explicit language. ""What he did was beyond anything I could envision seeing in a courtroom,"" Flaiz told CNN a few hours after a judge ordered Lane to spend the rest of his life in prison without parole. ""I was shocked and disgusted at how the defendant conducted himself."" Lane smiled and smirked during much of the hearing, laughing when Flaiz described him as an ""evil person."" According to the Geauga County prosecutor, Common Pleas Judge David L. Fuhry was unaware that Lane had the lettered T-shirt. ""I think everyone felt the effect of that shirt at the same time,"" said defense attorney Ian Friedman, according to CNN Cleveland affiliate WJW. Friedman said he, too, had no advance knowledge of the T-shirt. Lane pleaded guilty last month to three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and weapons-related charges. The death penalty was off the table because of Lane's age at the time of the crimes, according to prosecutors. For their part, victims' relatives kept calm and made their own statements, describing the pain they felt and the profound loss to both themselves and the community. They also cited the contributions of their killed or wounded loved ones. ""I was very proud of the family members in the courtroom,"" said Flaiz, adding he was not sure he could have kept his composure if he were in their shoes. The mother of a wounded student now confined to a wheelchair looked directly at Lane as she told him he was fortunate so many officers were in the small courtroom. Friends, family remember Ohio school shooting victims . ""Because of you, our town will never be same,"" Holly Walczak said. ""Why? Why did you do it? Why?"" Walczak said she has watched her son, Nick, suffer daily in the year since he was shot in the school cafeteria and in the hallway when he was pursued by Lane. ""You are evil. I will have to eventually forgive, otherwise you will haunt me,"" she told Lane. Demetrius Hewlin, 16, died from his wounds. His brother, Philip Carter, read a statement in court on behalf of mother Phyllis Ferguson. ""In our humanity, we still cannot understand why his life was taken in such a violent manner,"" said Carter. Authorities allege that Lane walked up to a table in the Chardon High School cafeteria and started firing. When the violence ended, six students had been shot, and in the following days, three died: Daniel Parmertor, 16; Hewlin; and Russell King Jr., 17. T.J. Lane was known by many around Chardon High, 30 miles east of Cleveland. But at the time of the shooting, he was there to be transported to Lake Academy Alternative School in nearby Willoughby. Lake Academy describes itself as a school for ""at-risk"" students who are ""reluctant learners"" struggling with problems such as substance abuse and mental health issues. After the shooting, an assistant football coach chased Lane out of Chardon High, and police arrested him nearby a short time later. Parmertor's mother, Dina, last year told CNN's Anderson Cooper her son was a jokester  ""everyone wanted to be around."" Daniel had just started a job at a local bowling alley. ""My heart is broken. It is torn apart. .. I want people to know him,"" said Dina Parmertor. ""They did not know the joy of knowing him."" Tuesday, she looked at Lane and called him a ""weak, pathetic vile coward."" ""If I had my choice you would die an extremely slow, torturous death,"" the mother said. Before he sentenced Lane to consecutive sentences of life without parole and additional sentences totaling 37 years, Fuhry said the former student showed no remorse, feigned mental illness and seemed determined to make ""front-page news."" ""A school is a place where a student should feel safe,"" the judge said, adding Lane took advantage of unsuspecting students. ""These juveniles were ambushed."" Fuhry said Lane would be a danger if he were ever released. King's sister, Crystal, called Lane a ""monster."" Her brother was a compassionate blood donor who tried to become a friend of Lane because ""he felt sorry for him."" After the sentencing, defense attorney Friedman said Lane's comment to the families was a ""very difficult statement to hear."" Lane's sister, Sadie Lane, pleaded for compassion and prayers for her family a well as for those of the victims. She, too, was in the school cafeteria when the rampage began. ""Many families were damaged that day. Our family was, too,"" she said. While the judge indicated Tuesday there was no known motive for the attacks, Flaiz said his office has a theory it would have presented if the case had gone to trial. He declined to elaborate, saying he will meet with victims' family members in the next week. ""I got a sense from the families they wanted to hear why he did it and they wanted to hear remorse,"" Flaiz said. Residents have come together since the shootings, the prosecutor said. ""Sometimes it takes a tragedy for everyone to realize how close-knit a community we have."" ""In the end, everyone is sad. It is an incredibly sad situation.""","Prosecutor says victims' families kept composure .

"What does temptation taste like? For the sweet-toothed army of Sungeni Mtalimanja's clients, it's all about buttermilk and cocoa dipped in a sea of dark red. ""Red velvet [cake] -- that's a big thing at the moment,"" says Mtalimanja, founder of Sweet Temptations by Sungeni. ""A lot of people actually like that recipe."" Based in the city of Blantyre, Malawi's chief commercial and industrial hub, Mtalimanja's baking business produces all sorts of custom-made ""sweet temptations"" -- from delicious red velvet cakes topped with moist cream cheese frosting to fluffy chocolate cupcakes full of rich flavor. Driven by passion . Yet, crafting yummy baked goods was not something the young entrepreneur had ever envisaged. A trained lawyer, Mtalimanja had been working in the local legal industry for a number of years when one day in late 2012 she began helping her sister-in-law bake desserts. Mtalimanja was instantly hooked. ""I never knew I had this passion for cakes,"" she says. ""Sometimes a passion comes from the comments that people make -- if people say, 'this is great, this is awesome,' you're inclined to do more, you want to explore more and you want to improve on it,"" adds Mtalimanja. ""I want to get to the next level; I want to be different,"" she adds. ""I'm very passionate about what I do."" Thus, last year, Mtalimanja decided to turn her passion for cake making into something bigger. Without having any formal training in baking, she launched Sweet Temptations by Sungeni -- all the while keeping her full-time law job. ""It wasn't easy,"" recalls the 30-year-old entrepreneur. ""I worked late nights and was up very early for a period of six months."" 'Everyone wants cake' Yet, as word spread out and orders started piling in, Mtalimanja decided to make Sweet Temptations her priority and main source of income. ""The industry is quite booming at the moment,"" she says. ""Cakes are very popular -- It wasn't like that before; before you could only see those cakes when you were celebrating your birthday but now it's like for any kind of celebration -- whether it'd be a bridal shower, birthday, graduation or someone who is coming home for the first time after a long time, everyone wants to get into that mood of having a cake."" Bigger dreams . Yet, running a cake business in Malawi comes with its own set of difficulties -- a beautiful landlocked country in southeastern Africa, Malawi is one of the continent's poorest nations. ""You'd get power cuts at any time of the day, especially in the evening,"" says Mtalimanja. Another challenge, she adds, is finding all the ingredients required, especially as client orders get more diverse -- from superheroes and football logos to hen party cakes in the shape of a female body wearing lingerie. ""Now people want to go crazy,"" says Mtalimanja. ""They want different shapes, they want different sizes, they want different types of icing and to find that in Malawi is quite challenging -- there's been a few people who have tried to bring stuff in from overseas but obviously to get it is very expensive."" Although still at the beginning, Mtalimanja has high hopes about her startup's future. ""I want a coffee shop,"" she says. ""I want a nice place, a cozy shop where I can have my own coffee shop and serve the cakes that I make -- that's my future plan, that's what I want to do."" Read this: 12-tier cakes and VIP toilets .

"It was a hot-button trial that drew comparisons to the proceedings against George Zimmerman in the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin.  The outcome, however, was vastly different. The jury in the case of Michael Dunn found him guilty Saturday night on four charges, including three of attempted second-degree murder, but they couldn't reach a verdict on the most significant charge -- first-degree murder in the death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis. The decision came on the eve of what would have been Davis' 19th birthday. ""It was too long before victims' voices were heard,"" Florida State Attorney Angela Corey, who also prosecuted the Zimmerman case, said after the verdict. ""Justice for Jordan Davis is as important as it is for any of our other victims,"" she added, saying that the Zimmerman verdict had nothing to do with her pursuit of the Dunn case. Like the Dunn trial, the earlier case had racial overtones and claims of self-defense, but Zimmerman was found not guilty in Martin's death on July 13, 2013. The verdict inflamed passions throughout the nation. Zimmerman trial: Where are they now? Davis' shooting also angered many people. It happened on November 23, 2012, when Dunn, who is white, pulled into a gas station in Jacksonville, parking next to a red SUV full of black teenagers. Loud music blared from the car. Dunn expressed his displeasure. Words were exchanged. Dunn opened fire, killing Davis. Dunn said he saw a gun. The teens were unarmed, prosecutors said. Moments before the Dunn verdict, Benjamin Crump, the attorney for the family of Trayvon Martin, appeared on CNN. He urged viewers to ""respect"" the jury's decision. ""Do not do like the killers of our children, who have taken the law into their own hands,"" he said. After the verdict, Crump said: ""As black males and black people in America, and other minorities and Hispanics as well, it is somehow, if you kill us, the justice system isn't equal. It is almost as if your life is less valuable ... The rules are different. If it were equal, I believe Michael Dunn would have been convicted of first-degree murder."" Still, Davis' mother, Lucia McBath, expressed her gratitude to the jury. ""We are so grateful for the truth,"" she said. ""It's a long, long road,"" she said, ""and we're so very happy to have just a little bit of closure."" She added, ""It's sad for Mr. Dunn that he will live the rest of his life with that sense of torment, and I will pray for him, and I've asked my family to pray for him."" Ron Davis, the teen's father, said he had waited 450 days for this moment. ""The whole world is looking at all of us here in Jacksonville,"" he said. Dunn's lawyer, Cory Strolla, talked about an appeal but acknowledged the likelihood that his client, at age 47, was looking at ""basically a life sentence."" The jury convicted Dunn on three counts of attempted second-degree murder, one for each of the other teens in the SUV. Dunn was also found ""guilty of shooting ... as charged in the indictment,"" according to the jury's decision read out in court. As the verdict became clear about 7 p.m. ET Saturday, Dunn looked ahead solemnly with a frown but no tears. Strolla said his client was ""in disbelief."" ""Even as he sat next to me, he asked, 'how is this happening,' "" Strolla said. ""... It has not set in. I don't think it will set in anytime soon."" Given the attention and emotions tied to the case, a ""comprehensive public safety plan"" was established ahead of a verdict, according to the Duval County joint information center handling the Dunn trial. Throughout the deliberations, dozens of protesters gathered, many carrying signs calling for justice for Jordan Davis. After the verdict, there was calm. Outside court, Bishop Rudolph W. McKissick Jr., senior pastor of Bethel Baptist Institutional Church in Jacksonville, had tears in his eyes as he described feeling numb. ""Not completely satisfied, you know,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, we walk away saying Jordan Davis was not vindicated. And I don't want us to get lost in the guilty verdicts and think that everything is justified. It's not. They walked away saying we could not decide that this man killed in cold blood a young man because he didn't like the loudness of his music, and, to us, that's sad."" Bishop John Guns of St. Paul Church in Jacksonville noted that the verdict came on the eve of the day the victim was born. ""How do we celebrate that?"" he asked. ""We have to make a decision that we have to really begin to look seriously at our legal system, at the application of the stand your ground law and some of the other dynamics that created the conditions and climate that brought about this. Jordan Davis will not die in vain."" On Facebook and Twitter, observers also voiced opinions. On Twitter, Lauren Chief Elk, wrote, ""A mistrial: What an incredible demonstration of the legal system protecting and upholding white male rights and interests."" A blogger named Courtney tweeted: ""I just never want to have to hear about anything like this ever again. But I know I will....""","Closely watched trial drew comparisons to Trayvon Martin case .

"Imagine shocks radiating across your cheek, a knife cutting into your skin or the feeling of hot coal burning your face, but not being able to find relief from the pain for months, or even years. That's what some trigeminal neuralgia patients say they endure on a regular basis. Trigeminal neuralgia is a facial pain disorder associated with the trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from your brain to your face. Slight touches to the face, whether it's a breeze, hair falling onto your temple or simply brushing your teeth, may trigger flashes of pain. The pain is most commonly caused by a blood vessel pushing on the trigeminal nerve. There is no cure. It affects approximately 12 out of every 100,000 people per year, according to the National Institute of Health, and is more common in women and people over 50. ""Trigeminal neuralgia is an uncommon disease and as a result, most physicians have very little experience with it. That is one of the reasons it's difficult to diagnose,"" said Ronald Brisman, a New York neurosurgeon who specializes in the disorder. The unbearable pain and search for a cure, as well as the medical field's unfamiliarity with the disorder, has led a group of about 30 trigeminal neuralgia patients to fight for awareness. Several of them, in addition to others with the disorder, started by sharing their personal stories with CNN iReport. 'I want to imagine a world where nobody has ... this pain' Nikki Samuel is one of those people. Her goal is to educate others about the disease, as well as let people know about the first International Trigeminal Neuralgia Awareness Day on October 7. Dozens of buildings and structures across the world are lighting up teal for the day. ""If we know that somebody, somewhere is looking for a cure and not just another medication or an even more invasive, risky procedure, it gives us hope,"" she wrote in her iReport. ""I want to imagine a world where nobody has to survive with this pain."" Samuel started experiencing the facial pain in 2005 and was diagnosed with Atypical Facial Pain. A variety of medications were ineffective and in 2008, the registered nurse from Leicester, England, admitted defeat and resigned from her job. ""I had achieved my dream and there it was, being taken away from me by this relentless, debilitating pain,"" she said. It was seven years from her first pangs of pain before she was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia. As a way to cope, the 41-year-old has turned to online support groups. ""My online friends have been my lifeline,"" she said. ""Trigeminal neuralgia has taken away many things, but it has given me the chance to 'meet' some amazing people and to make lifelong friendships."" 'I have forgotten what a pain-free day feels like' One of the people Samuel met online was Fred Gerwig, a former high school history teacher from rural West Virginia. Samuel's bravery inspired him to write about his experience, Gerwig said. Leaving his classroom on September 7, 2011, the sunlight seared his eyes, bringing on what he thought was his first migraine. The searing pain never left. After getting lidocaine injections to treat the migraine a month later, he said he started experiencing strange facial pains. ""There were shocks and pangs in my right cheek,"" he wrote on CNN iReport. ""It felt as if a hot coal was lying on my right eye socket."" Since then, wind, noise and even a random touch have all intensified his never-ending pain. Gerwig was later diagnosed with two disorders: ""atypical"" trigeminal neuralgia and a persistent unilateral headache on the same side. The ""atypical"" form of the disorder is marked by constant aching, burning and pain, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Numerous migraine and anti-seizure drugs haven't worked for him, and he's not a prime candidate for surgery to relieve pressure on his nerve. There aren't any blood vessels pushing on the trigeminal nerve, so the cause of his case is unknown. ""I have now forgotten what a pain free day feels like, and that changes you,"" said the stay-at-home dad. ""You lose parts of yourself. You lose friends and family that can't deal with the fact that they cannot give you a hug, say a prayer and make you better."" Watch video from another trigeminal neuralgia patient . 'Watching him suffer has broken me' Leslie Martella has crossed the country trying to find relief for her 16-year-old son, Garrett Buckelew. He was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia when he was 11, she said. ""Watching him suffer has broken me,"" the mother said. ""Garrett used to be an all-star baseball player, gifted student with high academic scores and awards, with tons of friends, and now he barely leaves our home."" Buckelew has had four surgeries to alleviate his pain, and four more surgeries after a complication occurred during one of the procedures. ""Trigeminal neuralgia has taken over our lives and is relentless,"" she said. ""It has robbed my child of his life."" The Huntsville, Alabama, mom wishes people knew about the real pain that patients with this invisible illness experience. ""If Garrett walked around with a hatchet sticking out of his face, then people would get it, but trigeminal neuralgia is invisible, and I hate it."" 'I am a trigeminal neuralgia warrior' When a flash of pain shot from her eye to her jaw one day in 1998, Patti SanFilippo hurried to the mirror looking for a mark on her face. There was nothing there. The Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, resident tried to describe the pain to her doctor, but she felt like a lunatic. She spent five years struggling to find answers before she was diagnosed. Even after multiple medications and surgeries to treat the disorder, none have helped ease her facial pain. ""A typical day in my life knows no real time and follows no structure. Pain wins over all else and many days are spent in bed,"" she said. ""I have missed many family functions, important birthdays and reunions with friends because the pain won on those days."" To stay positive, SanFilippo calls herself a ""trigeminal neuralgia warrior."" Surviving the ""horrendous pain, the harsh medications and lack of awareness"" has inspired her to fight for help and understanding of this outwardly invisible disorder. ""If my story has been read and shared then I know I did my part to start people learning, talking about and becoming more aware that such an evil condition exists and needs attention so desperately,"" she said. ""It's hopefully just the beginning, there is still so much that needs to be done.""","Trigeminal neuralgia is a facial pain disorder .

"If classified leaker Edward Snowden claims victory for disclosing details of U.S. surveillance programs, he should return all the other documents he has yet to to make public, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday. Terrorists and other foes were ""going to school"" on information revealed by Snowden so far, Clapper told the Senate Intelligence Committee, adding the disclosures put from disclosures put U.S. intelligence operations and citizens at risk. ""What Snowden has stolen and exposed has gone way, way beyond his professed concerns with so-called domestic surveillance programs,"" Clapper said. ""As a result, we've lost critical foreign intelligence collection sources, including some shared with us by valued partners."" Terrorists ""going to school"" Terrorists and other adversaries of America were ""going to school on U.S. intelligence sources' methods and trade craft, and the insights that they are gaining are making our job much, much harder, he continued. ""Snowden claims that he's won and that his mission is accomplished,"" Clapper also noted. ""If that is so, I call on him and his accomplices to facilitate the return of the remaining stolen documents that have not yet been exposed to prevent even more damage to U.S. security."" A former National Security Agency contractor, Snowden is in Russia seeking permanent asylum to avoid U.S. criminal charges over the leaking of classified documents that exposed surveillance programs, including the collection of phone records for possible use in terrorism investigations. Asked about the impact of the Snowden leaks at the hearing, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn told the panel the disclosures have caused ""grave damage"" to U.S. national security. ""The greatest cost that is unknown today but that we will likely face is the cost of human lives on tomorrow's battlefield or in some place where we will put our military forces when we ask them to go into harm's way,"" Flynn said. Proposed surveillance changes . President Barack Obama has proposed modest reforms to the surveillance programs disclosed by Snowden, but it remains unclear if a divided Congress will come to any agreement on changes intended to balance privacy concerns with national security needs. Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia criticized Obama's idea of having third party organizations or phone companies keep the metadata records, rather than the NSA. ""The collection and querying of this metadata is not a private sector responsibility,"" Rockefeller said, adding that ""going down this path will threaten, not strengthen, our ability to protect this country and the American people from a terrorist attack and massive invasions of their privacy."" Wednesday's committee hearing focused on the intelligence community's annual report of worldwide threats, and Clapper's opening statement outlined a series of crises and challenges amounted to a bleak outlook on the state of global affairs. ""Looking back over my more than half a century in intelligence, I have not experienced a time when we've been beset by more crises and threats around the globe,"" he said. He provided an overview that read like a compilation of cheap thriller novels -- dispersed terrorist networks that led to last year's Boston Marathon bombing; Syria's civil war that he said created a ""growing center of radical extremism""; that conflict's destabilizing impact on neighboring Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Turkey; increased foreign cyber capabilities; a ""dangerous, unpredictable North Korea""; ""perpetual conflict and extremism in Africa,"" and increased stress of growing populations that creates competition for energy, food and water. Al Qaeda in 12 countries . Asked about al Qaeda, Clapper said it had spawned five different franchises operating in 12 countries including Yemen, Somalia, Syria and elsewhere. He was especially concerned about Syria, saying it had become ""a huge magnet for extremists"" with an estimated 26,000 of them among 1,600 groups in the war-torn Middle East nation. ""We estimate, at this point, in excess of 7,000 foreign fighters have been attracted from some 50 countries, many of them in Europe and the Mideast,"" Clapper added. The foreign extremists ""engage in combat, get training, and we're seeing now the appearance of training complexes in Syria to train people to go back to their countries, and, of course, conduct more terrorist acts,"" he said, calling it a ""huge concern."" North Korea nuclear program . Regarding the often unnerving actions of North Korea, Clapper said Kim Jong Un's regime appeared to have gone ahead with plans it announced last spring to step up activities at its nuclear facilities. North Korea has restarted a plutonium production reactor and expanded a uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon, its main nuclear complex, he said in his written testimony to the committee. His assessment tallies with researchers' analysis of satellite images of the Yongbyon complex from August. Clapper also warned that North Korea is ""committed to developing a long-range missile technology that is capable of posing a direct threat to the United States."" But he said the longstanding view of U.S. intelligence is that Pyongyang sees its nuclear program as ""intended for deterrence, international prestige and coercive diplomacy.""","Clapper says North Korea has stepped up activities at its main nuclear complex .

"An Israeli soldier who was critically injured in fighting last month died Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces announced in a tweet. The death of Sgt. Shacar Shalev, 20, came almost a week after a new ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that ended more than seven weeks of fighting. Shalev's death increases the number killed on the Israeli side in the conflict to 68. Of those, 65 are soldiers and two are Israeli civilians. A foreign worker in Israel was also killed. The United Nations has said more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the violence in Gaza. The U.N estimates at least 70% of the Palestinians killed were civilians, but Israel reports a higher number of militants among the dead. The ceasefire agreed to Tuesday between Israeli and Hamas officials has no expiration date, unlike several previous ones. The truce does not deal with core long-term issues on both sides. But Israel agreed to ease the blockade on Gaza, open border crossings for more aid to pass through and extend the fishing limit off the coast to 6 miles, according to a senior Egyptian government official. Both sides agreed to return to Cairo for further talks, the official said.","Israeli soldier dies from injuries suffered in Hamas conflict .

"Mason heard gunshots while he was outside with classmates, waiting for school to start. Then students were running, and a teacher was lying still on a playground basketball court, hit by gunfire. The 12-year-old wanted to help him, but a vice principal told him to run. So Mason moved toward the building -- and that's when he saw Jose Reyes, a friend and a Sparks Middle School classmate, with a gun about 10 to 20 feet away. ""I (said), 'Please don't shoot me, please don't shoot me,'"" Mason told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday from a hospital where he was being treated. ""I looked at him. I saw (the gun), and he braced it and shot me in the stomach."" Authorities say Mason was the last of three people that Reyes, 12, shot with a 9 mm handgun Monday morning outside the school. Mason and another wounded student -- the first to be shot -- survived. Math teacher Mike Landsberry, the second to be hit, died. Investigators say Landsberry probably saved lives by walking toward the shooter -- giving others time to flee -- on the basketball court after the first student was shot in the shoulder. Reyes fatally shot himself, police said. Sgt. Greta  Woyciehowsky of the Sparks Police Department and Adam Mayberry, a spokesman for the city of Sparks, confirmed Reyes was the shooter. Mason, shot in the abdomen, was able to walk at the hospital Thursday. His mother, Jenifer Davis, said the bullet missed vital parts and exited behind his right hip. ""I'm ... very lucky I still have him here,"" Davis said. Now Mason is left wondering what caused his friend to hurt him and a classmate, and kill a teacher that Mason deeply admired. Slain Nevada teacher Michael Landsberry calmly gave others time to escape . The shooting . Mason said the incident began when he heard a few gunshots -- he thought they were in the distance -- as children gathered outside the school after 7 a.m., waiting for the day to begin. At first confused about why schoolmates were running, he saw Landsberry lying wounded on the basketball court. A friend called 911. Mason and other students wanted to get Landsberry into the school, he said. ""We tried, and one of my vice principals ... said, 'Get in the building, get in the school fast.' And that's when I ran to my backpack, and I (eventually) got shot."" Reyes -- a friend Mason had met at the start of the school year -- said nothing as he shot him, Mason recalled. When Mason was shot, he said, he felt a sharp pain in the abdomen and ran from the shooter. He soon saw a security guard, who told him to lie down and put pressure on his wound, Mason said. The shooter . Authorities haven't said why they believe Reyes opened fire. Earlier this week, a 13-year-old Sparks Middle School student told CNN that many people speculated that bullying could have played a role . Reyes, according to the student, ""was yelling stuff like, 'Why are you laughing at me? Why are you doing this to me?'"" during the shooting. Mason said he wasn't aware of any bullying. ""I don't think he was being bullied at all ... because if he was being bullied and I saw it, I would have stuck up for him. I was one of his friends,"" Mason said. He said the shooter was nice, but sometimes started arguments with people he disagreed with. ""Anything you're talking about, (if) he doesn't agree with it, he would start arguing ... with that person about what the person said. I (saw) him doing it a lot at school,"" Mason said. Mason said he doesn't believe Reyes sought him out or the other wounded student during the shooting. ""We never bullied him. We never (did) anything to"" him, he said. ""After he shot me, I thought that he wasn't my real friend,"" he added. Davis, Mason's mother, told CNN that she grieves for the shooter's family. ""They lost their son, their baby,"" Davis said. ""They're 12-year-old boys ... they have no idea what they're doing."" Teacher was 'good all-around' guy . 'Keep these guns out of kids' hands' Reyes took his parents' handgun to school, a federal law enforcement source said. Sparks Deputy Police Chief Tom Miller said Tuesday that authorities weren't positive where the gun came from, but believe it belonged to the boy's parents. The Nevada shooting comes almost a year after a gunman killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, igniting a nationwide debate over gun violence and school safety. Since the Newtown shootings last December, proposed school security plans across the country have included arming teachers, adding armed security guards and bringing in bulletproof backpacks and white boards. ""It's really mainly about educating these kids about what guns can do, and also keeping your guns locked up,"" Davis said. ""I own a gun, but I also own a safe it goes in,"" she said. ""That's why my whole thing is: Keep these guns out of kids' hands. Protect your guns -- that protects your kids."" Teacher slayings hurt view of schools as safe havens . Landsberry 'fun to hang around' Landsberry was an Alabama native who graduated from high school in Reno, next door to Sparks, in 1986. After a stint in the Marine Corps, he got an education degree from the University of Nevada in Reno. He joined the Air National Guard in 2001, rising to the rank of master sergeant and serving as a cargo specialist in Kuwait and Afghanistan, the Guard said. A Facebook memorial page for the teacher had more than 10,000 ""likes"" by early Tuesday. Thousands more honored him on a ""Rest Easy Mr. Landsberry"" page. Mason said Landsberry was never his teacher, but losing him is hard. He would visit Landsberry during lunch ""because he was funny and friendly, and fun to hang around,"" he said. ""(Students) loved him so much,"" Mason said. Davis said she hoped the hospital would release Mason later Thursday or Friday. She said she and her son will have a conversation about when  -- and whether -- he will return to the school. ""We're going to talk about that. ... He would have a lot of support there,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- In April this year, people in Myanmar picked up their newspapers and saw ... nothing. Front pages across the Southeast Asian nation were completely black, in a show of solidarity for a journalist that was simply doing his job. This week, as world leaders gather to meet their regional counterparts in Myanmar's capital Naypyidaw for two major summits, attendees should make a similarly firm statement about freedom of the press. The darkened front pages -- a remarkable move in a country where just a few years before, the military government imposed blanket controls on all media -- were in response to the case of Zaw Pe, a journalist with the independent Democratic Voice of Burma who had been sentenced to one year in jail. His ""crime"" was to investigate corruption in his home town, a story the authorities apparently did not want to see the light of day. It was a preposterous ruling against a journalist who was just doing his job, and Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience -- jailed solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression. Sadly, the move says much about the backslide in free speech in Myanmar, as the authorities re-tighten their grip on media and increasingly target peaceful critics ahead of national elections next year. This tightening comes despite Myanmar's supposed transition away from military rule, which began in 2011, but which is stalling as the government wrestles over how to secure the benefits of greater economic openness while controlling rising expectations of rights and freedoms that come with this. Unfortunately, its efforts to maintain control have frequently involved resorting to familiar tactics of repression and arrests. President Thein Sein has promised to clear the country's jails of prisoners of conscience. Yet dozens still remain behind bars, while the jailing of land rights activists, journalists and other human rights defenders has actually picked up pace in the past year. And this is not just a problem in Myanmar -- governments across Southeast Asia, of all political persuasions, are closing down space for dissenting voices. Just look at Thailand, where the new government -- formed following a military coup in May -- has imposed blanket restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Gatherings of more than five people have been banned, and even eating a sandwich or reading a book in symbolic protest against the government can land you in front of a military court. Indeed, Thailand's media operates under the constant watch of ""censorship panels,"" and the months since the coup have seen a surge in police investigations and prosecutions under the country's lÃ¨se majestÃ© laws, which ban criticism of the royal family. Authorities in Malaysia, meanwhile, are increasingly making use of the draconian Sedition Act to silence peaceful critics, using a colonial-era law that gives the government sweeping powers to silence dissent. Two people have been convicted of sedition this year, with at least a dozen others currently facing charges. Scores more have been investigated for ""seditious"" activities, including opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who was placed under investigation in September. In Vietnam, the authorities continue to tightly control the media, and in recent years online activists and bloggers have been thrown into jail on spurious charges -- there are scores of prisoners of conscience languishing in harsh conditions. Next door in Cambodia, where earlier this year, security forces shot dead protesting garment workers, an alleged draft Cybercrime Law would criminalize and censor online expression critical of the government and its policies. Finally, even in Indonesia, which has been praised for its growing openness to improving human rights, dozens of individuals have been prosecuted under the country's blasphemy laws as repression of minority religious groups has intensified -- that is in addition to the cases of scores of peaceful pro-independence activists from the Papua and Maluku regions who remain imprisoned, some for as long as 20 years, some for simply raising a flag. Southeast Asia has come a long way in recent decades in its efforts to improve respect for human rights, a change that has helped unleash some of the region's economic potential. Yet the restrictions on free speech sweeping across the region are troubling, and are only likely to discourage much-needed investment from overseas. Those attending the November summits have an opportunity to reverse this trend. But to do so they must start by speaking out for all those in Southeast Asia whose voices have been silenced -- and demand the release of all prisoners of conscience jailed simply for the peaceful expression of their views.","Restrictions on free speech sweeping parts of Asia are troubling: Rupert Abbott .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Releasing a report that links some of baseball's best to the use of performance-enhancing substances, former Sen. George Mitchell said Thursday it is critical that Major League Baseball restore the integrity of the game. Former Sen. George Mitchell gives his report Thursday on steroid use in baseball. ""This is a serious problem that cannot be solved by anything less than a well-conceived, well-executed and cooperative effort by everyone involved in baseball,"" Mitchell said in announcing his findings. ""Everyone involved in baseball over the past two decades -- commissioners, club officials, the Players Association, the players -- shares, to some extent, in the responsibility for the steroid era,"" he said. ""There was a collective failure to recognize the problem as it emerged and to deal with it early on.""  Watch Mitchell report on steroid use in baseball » . Dozens of current and former major league baseball players, including Roger Clemens, Yankee teammate Andy Pettitte, sluggers Mo Vaughn and Gary Sheffield, and reliever Eric Gagne, are named as being linked to steroid use in the report.  See players named on the list » . It's ""a call to action, and I will act,"" Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said Thursday afternoon. Selig announced he would take steps including embracing the recommendations contained in Mitchell's report and implementing as many as possible; dealing with the players named in the report; and reviewing comments about club personnel. ""Discipline of players and others identified in this report will be determined on a case-by-case basis. If warranted, those decisions will be made swiftly,"" Selig said.  Watch Selig's reaction » . 'Saddest day' Several teams, contacted by CNN, said they were reviewing the report and would have no immediate comment. A few others expressed their support for the report and for eliminating the use of banned substances from baseball. But the head of the Major League Baseball Players Association had some critical words. ""Many players are named. Their reputations have been adversely affected, probably forever, even if it turns out down the road that they should not have been,"" Donald Fehr said. Mitchell, Selig and Fehr will be asked to testify Tuesday at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing. But lawmakers are already weighing in on the report. ""As a fan and former player, this is the saddest day in my life for baseball,"" said Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Kentucky, a nine-time All Star pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Phillies. He said the report was ""a job well done,"" but contained one glaring hole: How to handle the records of players who used steroids. ""I believe that those players who tried to gain an unfair advantage by using these substances should have their records stripped,"" Bunning said. Clemens 'upset' The report describes how Clemens got injections of the steroid Winstrol in Clemens' apartment in Toronto's Skydome in 1998, according to Brian McNamee, named in the report as a possible distributor of steroids. McNamee ""injected Clemens approximately four times in the buttocks over a several week period with needles that Clemens provided,"" the report states. ""During this period of improved performance, Clemens told McNamee that the steroids 'had a pretty good effect' on him,"" the report says.  Learn more about anabolic steroids » . McNamee injected Clemens with testosterone and human growth hormone after Clemens moved to the New York Yankees in 2000, the report says. Clemens' attorney said the seven-time Cy Young Award winner ""vehemently denies"" the allegations in the report.  Watch the attorney say Clemens is upset » . McNamee also became Pettitte's personal trainer in 1999, the report says. ""McNamee recalled that he injected Pettitte with human growth hormone ... on two to four occasions"" in 2002 to help Pettitte recover from elbow tendonitis, the report says. Mitchell embarked on his multimillion-dollar task at Selig's behest, who felt an inquiry was necessary after reading ""Game of Shadows."" The book was written by two San Francisco newspaper reporters who chronicled the alleged drug use of home-run king Barry Bonds. Bonds, who faces federal perjury and obstruction charges for allegedly lying in 2003 about his steroid use, set the record for career home runs this year -- 762. He hit 73 home runs in 2001 to top Mark McGwire's 1998 record. Before the McGwire-Sammy Sosa race -- which McGwire won with 70 homers to Sosa's 66 -- Roger Maris' record of 61 home runs in a season had stood for 37 years. Mitchell's report references the 1998 home run duel, but only briefly mentions Sosa. No one interviewed repeated former slugger and admitted steroid user Jose Canseco's charges that McGwire also was a steroid user, Mitchell said in the report.  Watch Canseco say the report backs his claims » . He suggested, however, that the discovery of the steroid precursor androstenedione in McGwire's locker was a watershed moment for baseball in terms of it finally opening eyes to steroid use. No other McGwire steroid connection is mentioned in the report, although Mitchell notes that he, too, refused to meet with investigators. Tough probe . Mitchell's investigation was a difficult one because he had no subpoena power, meaning he had no way to force players or witnesses to cooperate with his investigation. A major source for Mitchell's probe was Kirk Radomski, a former clubhouse employee for the New York Mets who is named in the report as a ""significant source of illegal performance-enhancing substances until late 2005."" Radomski assisted with the report as part of his plea bargain with the federal government in the case against the Bay Area Co-Operative Laboratory; he pleaded guilty in April to illegally distributing performance-enhancing drugs. Baseball didn't begin testing for steroids until 2003. In a CNN interview, Victor Conte, the founder of the Bay Area Co-Operative, said pro baseball's drug-testing policy is a farce. Conte said the World Anti-Doping Agency lists 60 stimulants as banned substances, only half of which are recognized by Major League Baseball. By not including the other 30 substances on the list, baseball is essentially promoting their use, he said.  Watch Conte explain why tougher testing is needed » . Despite the steroid controversy, Major League Baseball enjoyed record revenues of $6 billion this year, and for the fourth year in a row, the league set a total attendance record.

"(CNN) -- Nigeria is Africa's top oil producer, with exports worth $59 billion last year, but the industry has long been dominated by foreign players. Overseas corporations, with a multinational workforce, have traditionally been chosen to carry out drilling operations, but one company bucking the trend is Seawolf Oilfield Services, Nigeria's only offshore drilling contractor. CNN's Robyn Curnow sat down with Adolor Uwamu, CEO of Seawolf, to discuss the challenges of doing business in Nigeria and competing with the big boys of oil production. CNN: You're one of the few African players in this business in Nigeria -- why is that? Adolor Uwamu: It's a capital intensive business -- a business of high complexity -- and drilling rigs cost quite a bit of money. It's a business that has been controlled and operated by, I would say, about five to seven global players worldwide who operate in different regions of the world but mostly American and European. CNN: Why did you start (Seawolf)? Surely there are easier ways to make money? AU: Because there was an opportunity for Nigerians to get into the business. Nigeria is the seventh or eighth-largest producer of oil in the world. It's the major industry in Nigeria and Nigerians are not actively in the business. We're not involved in the business at the sufficient level that we should be. For the last 40 years oil and gas drilling in Nigeria has been undertaken by the global players. CNN: Has the Nigerian government now said: ""Listen, we need more local people in our industries?"" AU: The Nigerian government has greatly encouraged the participation of local players in the industry across the spectrum of services. Not just in drilling but in other services in the oil and gas business. That encouragement is providing the environment for Nigerians to increase their skills and increase their participation, which has overall benefits for the economy. CNN: But it's still about the private sector actually financing this and actually fueling this opportunity isn't it? The government can only do so much. AU: That is correct, the government will provide the enabling environment which is what they're doing, but they need the participation and cooperation of the private sector to finance the participation in the industry. CNN: What for you is the biggest challenge? AU: The biggest challenges for us has been developing the talent that is required at that global level. CNN: So there's just not enough skilled Nigerians to work on your oil rigs? AU: There are not enough skilled Nigerians in general in the oil and gas industry, which is the issue that the government is trying to correct by encouraging and putting in place the enabling environment to increase the Nigerian participation. The reason why there's not been sufficient Nigerian involvement is because historically there's a lot of transfer of talent globally from the more established Western countries working in Nigeria. The result of that over years is not enough participation by Nigerians in the industry. CNN: Do you think Nigeria has failed to capitalize on the opportunities oil could have offered ordinary Nigerians? AU: I wouldn't agree with that, I would say that we've been less than optimal in our management over oil resources but we haven't missed the boat. There are still opportunities. I would say in the last couple of years we've done well in terms of monetizing our gas resources and now I believe the government should focus on revamping the downstream industry, ensuring that the refineries work, increase the refining capacity in the country. CNN: That's key, isn't it? AU: It is key, because what it does is it prevents us from importing refined petroleum products, which is less than an optimal situation when you're the seventh-largest producer of crude oil in the world.","Nigerian oil exports worth $59 billion last year .

"(CNN) -- Iran hanged two men at the end of January -- the first political prisoners known to be executed in Iran since the demonstrations protesting the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, according to Amnesty International. It's still not entirely clear what Arash Rahmanipour and Mohammad Reza Ali-Zamani's crime was. Rahmanipour's lawyer said he was already in jail on election day in June 2009, so he couldn't have been involved in the post-election uprising, she said. But whatever their earthly crimes were, the two men executed last month were also accused of another offense far more serious than simply protesting against a government. They were convicted of being ""mohareb,"" enemies of God. That is the worst possible crime in Shiite Muslim law, according to Abbas Milani, the director of Iranian studies at Stanford University. The legal implications are clear, he said. ""A mohareb, according to Shiite law, is executed,"" he said. That the regime is labeling its opponents enemies of God is a sign of how rattled it is by the protests, he said. ""They were completely caught off guard by the ferocity and extent of the opposition and they pulled out all the stops,"" he said. Traditional accusations did not succeed in intimidating the protesters, he said. ""They accused them of working in cahoots with the United States and Israel. When it didn't work, they said you are mohareb,"" he said. Legally, there's nowhere for the government to escalate from here, he added. ""I can't imagine them upping the legal ante,"" he said. ""What you can do is increase the number of people they are executing in an in-your-face manner to bring terror to the people."" In fact, at least one other person is on death row for being a mohareb, according to the Tehran Judiciary as quoted by the semi-official Iran Students News Agency. Labeling opponents of the government ""enemies of God"" is a relatively new tactic, said Iranian journalist Amir Taheri, who argued that religious tolerance was more traditionally Iranian. ""It was not like that the beginning of the revolution. The revolution was an Islamic revolution but they did not try to give a religious aspect,"" he told CNN's Hala Gorani. ""Now unfortunately they are giving a very dangerous and arguably un-Iranian religious aspect to it by hating the Jews, hating the Baha'is, [using] anti-Christian propaganda, executing or even murdering some Sunni Muslim preachers,"" said Taheri, who fled Iran after the revolution. The religious intolerance ""is really completely new and this is one of the ugliest aspects"" of the current regime, he said. Milani said that even Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic regime, did not accuse his opponents of being enemies of God. ""In the early days of the revolution, Khomeini threatened to declare these people as mohareb, but I don't remember them ever passing a law that says if you go out and demonstrate, you are a mohareb,"" Milani said. Khomeini leveled a different charge at his opponents, calling them ""mofsed fel-Arz,"" or he who brings corruption, Milani said. The charge was ""introduced by Khomeini, and they killed thousands of people, but at that time even Khomeini was averse"" to describing his opponents as mohareb, he said. Using it now implicitly ""beatifies Khomeini,"" Milani said. ""They are making him a god."" It also could be a sign of panic on the part of the authorities, he said. ""It takes a lot of ... political insecurity to say if you don't do something I tell you to do, you are an enemy of God,"" he said.","Those convicted of being ""mohareb,"" enemies of God, are executed .

"(CNN) -- In the Internet age, we have no choice but to entrust our data with private companies: e-mail providers, service providers, retailers, and so on. We realize that this data is at risk from hackers. But there's another risk as well: the employees of the companies who are holding our data for us. In the early years of Facebook, employees had a master password that enabled them to view anything they wanted in any account. NSA employees occasionally snoop on their friends and partners. The agency even has a name for it: LOVEINT. And well before the Internet, people with access to police or medical records occasionally used that power to look up either famous people or people they knew. The latest company accused of allowing this sort of thing is Uber, the Internet car-ride service. The company is under investigation for spying on riders without their permission. Called the ""god view,"" some Uber employees are able to see who is using the service and where they're going -- and used this at least once in 2011 as a party trick to show off the service. A senior executive also suggested the company should hire people to dig up dirt on their critics, making their database of people's rides even more ""useful."" None of us wants to be stalked -- whether it's from looking at our location data, our medical data, our emails and texts, or anything else -- by friends or strangers who have access due to their jobs. Unfortunately, there are few rules protecting us. Government employees are prohibited from looking at our data, although none of the NSA LOVEINT creeps were ever prosecuted. The HIPAA law protects the privacy of our medical records, but we have nothing to protect most of our other information. Your Facebook and Uber data are only protected by company culture. There's nothing in their license agreements that you clicked ""agree"" to but didn't read that prevents those companies from violating your privacy. This needs to change. Corporate databases containing our data should be secured from everyone who doesn't need access for their work. Voyeurs who peek at our data without a legitimate reason should be punished. There are audit technologies that can detect this sort of thing, and they should be required. As long as we have to give our data to companies and government agencies, we need assurances that our privacy will be protected. Moreover, we need legal limits on what can be done with our data. Companies are starting to analyze our personal data and publish the results, sometimes in an effort to get positive press. And while it may be fun for Uber to publish data on riders heading off to one-night stands and hookups with prostitutes (Uber recently deleted both posts), or for OKCupid to publish their users' sexual preferences and habits, this is very intimate information. Were Uber or OKCupid a university, this analysis would have to be approved by an ethics board entrusted with protecting the subjects' privacy. Private companies' research isn't overseen in any way, meaning that no one reviews this research with an eye towards protecting the subjects. Making these changes doesn't require an act of Congress. It's something that the Federal Trade Commission can do under the auspices of consumer protection. As long as companies are collecting and storing our data, they need to be held to standards of security and professionalism. The general problem of our data being accessible won't go away. There are huge benefits in putting your data in the cloud, and that's not going to change. Companies like Google and Facebook need to be able to work on the computers and networks that contain your data, so engineers will need access. Unless your data on these other computers is encrypted -- and in many cases it will never be because that renders it useless -- interested people will be able to access your personal information. We're now living in a world where a lot of intimate data is stored in some third-party database somewhere -- the emails and texts we send and receive, our location data from our cell phones, the things we purchase, the Web pages we look at, and the search terms we use. This data is bought and sold, and used to manipulate us with personalized advertising. But there's something extra-creepy about people using it to stalk us or analyze our lifestyles.

"We can assume that when Richard III was interred by the monks in the church of the Greyfriars, possibly with a few of Henry Tudor's henchmen present to see that it was done, it would not have been the burial a king of England could have expected. The confirmation that the remains found in Leicester are those of King Richard means that, at last, this can be put right and he can be laid to rest with the solemnity and dignity that is appropriate for an anointed king. Even more significantly, the finding and reinterment of Richard III's remains will, we hope, open up the debate about the king and his reputation. It would make such a difference if people would start to look into the history of this much maligned monarch without the old prejudices. Perhaps, then, they will see past the myth and innuendo that has blackened his name and find the truth. No one is going to suggest that he was a saint - I have said on many occasions that we are not the Richard III Adoration Society - but even a cursory reading of the known facts will show that the Tudor representation of Richard III, especially that in Shakespeare's well known play, just doesn't stand up. Read more: Richard III's story ""stuff of legend"" Shakespeare wrote a great play but even he must have been aware that he was twisting the facts in order to make it more dramatic. After all, he called it a ""tragedy"" not a ""history."" His Richard III is a villain and a superb villain at that, but Shakespeare was not writing history, no matter what the Duke of Marlborough might have thought. There are many instances where the portrayal just does not fit the historical record. For instance, in one of his three plays about Henry VI, Shakespeare has Richard of Gloucester, later Richard III, killing the Duke of Somerset at the first battle of St Albans. At the time of that fight, Richard Plantagenet wasn't Duke of Gloucester and, more cogently, he wasn't yet three years old! The Richard III Society was founded as the Fellowship of the White Boar almost 90 years ago. It was re-founded in 1956 and changed its name three years later, as a result of which, it took on a more missionary approach to its aims of securing a reassessment of the material relating to the life and times of this king. This was not new, of course, as reassessment had begun in the 17th century after the death of the last Tudor monarch and it has continued ever since. Over the centuries, the approach to Richard III's reputation has swung like a pendulum. If, as a result of the finding of Richard III and all the publicity it has engendered, people can be encouraged to read the facts for themselves, it will be a truly great event and all who have been involved in the project are to be congratulated. I have followed its progress from an early stage when Philippa Langley, a member of the Richard III Society whose idea it was, first came to me to ask if she thought it was viable and would the society be willing to back it. I have tried to encourage her at times when doors were being shut and when there were setbacks and together we appealed for money when there was a shortfall. It is a great testament to Philippa's tenacity and bloody-mindedness that the project has been so successful. Read more: Richard III: The king and the car park? Richard III was no saint but neither was he a criminal. All but one of the so-called crimes laid at his door can be refuted by the facts. The one that cannot is the disappearance of his nephews, the ""Princes in the Tower"" and the answer to that question is simply that no-one knows what happened to them. All that follows is conjecture - they just disappeared. Richard had no need to kill them; they had been declared bastards. Henry VII needed them out of the way, but he got so scared whenever a pretender appeared that it is likely that he knew they were alive at the time Richard died at Bosworth. Did they die in 1483 or 1485 or were they spirited out of the country to their aunt, the Dowager Duchess of Burgundy? We will probably never know. To return to the question of what will the finding of Richard III's remains mean?

"Helga Jonsdottir still remembers in vivid detail the day her island home was swallowed by a volcano as she and her family joined others fleeing the molten lava. ""As my boat left the harbor, the fissure opened up, and flames burst into the sky,"" she recalls. ""The fissure extended into the ocean, and I could see red-hot lava beneath the water."" Jonsdottir was 18 in January 1973 when the Eldfell volcano exploded on Heimaey, a small island 151 kilometers (94 miles) from the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik. Her childhood home was among 400 buildings engulfed as 200 million tons of ash and lava rained down in the days following the eruption. Some of these structures have now emerged, perfectly preserved beneath the volcanic debris following an archaeological excavation begun six years ago. Worlds of fire . The result is a captivating new museum, Eldheimar, meaning ""worlds of fire,"" which opened its doors in May 2014. At the museum, visitors can revisit 1973, see a snapshot of life on Heimaey and also get insight into the devastation wreaked by the volcano. On the fateful night, the island's 5,300 residents were alerted to the eruption by the honking of fire engine horns. When they stepped outside their houses, they saw bright red lava exploding from Eldfell and a wall of fire spurting from a fissure snaking across the island. Only one person died as a result of the eruption. The vast majority of the islanders were evacuated that night, not returning until months later. Many of those living on the eastern side came back to find their houses engulfed by lava, while other properties had been completely flattened or buried under mountains of ash. A few islanders stayed away, but the majority rebuilt their houses closer to Vestmannaeyjar, the 13-square-kilometer (five square miles) island's only town. Time stands still . When archaeologists began to excavate the houses nearest to the volcano in 2006, they found that beneath the mountains of ash and frozen slabs of lava, time had stood still. Prior to the eruption, tables had been laid for breakfast and clothes folded and piled by the fireplace, but everything had been abandoned when the fire engines started sounding their horns. Archaeologists decided to focus on one particular cottage, which now forms the centerpiece of the Eldheimar museum, located on the outskirts of Vestmannaeyjar. Inside the museum's walls, petrified waterfalls of ash pour from the cottage's windows, through which lampshades, tablecloths and curtains can be seen. The mountains of ash visible from the museum's windows are reminders of just how close this island came to total destruction. Heimaey, a 25-minute plane ride from Reykjavik or a 30-minute ferry journey from Iceland's mainland, is a barren chunk of volcanic rock. Visitors who take the ferry arrive into a small harbor dramatically narrowed by a river of solidified lava. When Eldfell erupted, the lava flow almost cut the harbor off entirely. Locals slowed its progress by spraying it with cold water, but not before it had increased the island's size by one square mile. Towering banks of ash . The horizon here is dominated by two enormous volcanic peaks. Helgafell, a perfect, grass-covered cone, erupted thousands of years ago, spewing so much lava that two islands merged to form Heimaey. Eldfell, meanwhile, is a jagged, ash-covered reminder of the 1973 eruption, although in places, bright purple lupins sprout from the blackened slopes where locals have planted grass to improve its appearance and prevent erosion. On boat rides around the island, visitors pass towering banks of ash sloping down to the sea. In places, the coastline has been imprinted with a semi-geometric pattern, as though someone has transplanted part of Northern Ireland's Giant's Causeway here. A visit to Vinaminni Kaffihus, a cafe in Vestmannaeyjar run by Jonsdottir, offers fascinating insight into the events of 1973. Jonsdottir, who returned to Heimaey as a married woman two years after the eruption, opened the cafe as a memorial to the volcano. Each table tells the story of a different family, with before and after photos and accounts of that fateful night. Today Jonsdottir, like other islanders, says she's simply grateful for the low death toll, and the fact that the island wasn't destroyed entirely. ""We're just so thankful that we've been allowed to continue living in such a beautiful place,"" she explains. ""We came so close to this island being uninhabitable."" How to get there . Flights to Heimaey depart Reykjavik's domestic airport, which is a 40-minute drive from Keflavik International Airport. Round-trip fares with Eagle Air start from $359; +354 5624200 . Herjolfur ferries sail from Landeyjarhofn to Vestmannaeyjar. Landeyjarhofn is 132 kilometers (82 miles) from Reykjavik, in the south of Iceland. Prices start from $28 each way.

"If your smartphone is attached to your hip, your blood flows like a Twitter feed and you're fairly certain your eyes permanently see through an Instagram filter, then maybe it's time to disconnect for a bit? A new summer camp aims to help adults take a break from technology for a weekend of being a kid again. ""Camp Grounded,"" a retreat brought to you by the folks at The Digital Detox, takes place this June near Anderson Valley, Calif. (about two to three hours north of San Francisco). This four-day ""summer camp for adults"" in a 1970s-style Boy Scouts camp atmosphere brings together 232 campers who must follow some special rules: no technology use, no cell phones allowed and no talking about work. ""We really hope people reconnect with themselves,"" said Ben Hanna, a partner at The Digital Detox. ""So many people now don't understand their relationship with technology, but they do know something's wrong with how often they feel the need to check their phone."" Campers get to stay in open-faced cabins, eat in a dining hall and can participate in tech-free activities including archery, capture the flag, arts & crafts workshops, pillow fights and yoga. ""Part of what we want to do is give people this ability to kind of dive deep into something that they haven't really done,"" Hanna told Mashable. Compared to camp for kids, sneaking out at night is actually encouraged at Camp Grounded. Hanna said campers can wander through the woods to discover a ""magical nightlife."" ""You never really know what you're going to come across,"" he said. ""It might be a jazz quartet inside of a dancing school bus ... We're going to have a bunch of bonfires and musicians up there and stuff as well."" It is a drug- and alcohol-free event, and the camp will have medical personnel and a camp phone on site for emergencies. See Also: Vacationing Americans prefer giving up booze to mobile devices . Hanna says this sold-out June 14 to 17 event has attracted people from all over the world, including people in the tech community like CEOs and venture capitalists. But at camp, everyone will use nicknames and attendees can't ask each other their ages, so everyone is really ""just another camper,"" Hanna said. Though there is currently a waitlist, they plan to hold another session in the future, since demand has been so high. Hanna, a former tech industry whiz himself (he has worked at Couchsurfing.org), said The Digital Detox regularly holds other monthly device-free retreats, as well as device-free events that have a ""phone check"" (like a coat check). But with Camp Grounded, it's the largest retreat they've done so far, according to Hanna. ""When you were a kid, your life was not dominated by the technology that it is now,"" he said. ""We want to take people back to that easy state of living where their only concern is 'what's the next activity that I'm going to right now and what's going to be the next fun thing?'"" Could you survive a tech-free weekend on a ""digital detox?"" Or would it be too difficult for you to disconnect? Share your thoughts on this concept in the comments.

"The family of a 9-year-old girl who accidentally shot and killed an Arizona instructor with an Uzi is ""devastated"" and asking for privacy, according to a statement from a family lawyer. ""Words cannot express the family's sadness about the accidental shooting of Charles Vacca,"" attorney Kevin Walsh said Tuesday. ""They are devastated by this accident that turned what was supposed to be a unique and brief excursion from their summer vacation into a life-changing tragedy. They are dealing with this privately as a family,"" he said. Charles Vacca was shot in the head last month as he showed the New Jersey girl how to fire the Israeli-made 9mm submachine gun. As she pulled the trigger, the gun jumped out of her left hand toward Vacca, who was standing beside her. Authorities said the August 25 death was being handled as an industrial accident, with state occupational safety and health officials investigating. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also was notified. Prosecutors said they expected no charges to be filed. Cell phone video released by authorities shows the moments before the fatal shots were fired, CNN affiliate KLAS reported. In the video, Vacca and the girl are at an outdoor range. The wind blows a target in the distance. Vacca shows the child how to hold the gun and then helps her establish her grip and her stance. She fires one round, and dirt flies above the target. Vacca adjusts the Uzi, places his right hand on her back and his left under her right arm. She fires several rounds in rapid succession, and the gun kicks to the left as she loses control. The video ends before the fatal head shot. In releasing the video, authorities did not identify who made it. The shooting touched off a debate about whether children should be allowed to shoot guns like an Uzi. Bullets and Burgers, the shooting range where the accident happened, is part of a tourism niche offering packages costing up to $1,000 to shoot different high-powered weapons. The range offers bachelorette parties, birthday celebrations and wedding events. The Bullets and Burgers website says children between the ages of 8 and 17 can shoot a weapon if accompanied by a parent or guardian. ""Although certain people will seek to use this tragedy for their own partisan purposes and agendas, the family asks all compassionate Americans to pray for their children and the entire Vacca family.  Please respect both families' privacy as they seek to deal with this tragic accident,"" attorney Walsh said.

"Mastodons -- elephant-like beasts that lumbered across North America more than 10,000 years ago -- are long extinct, but apparently it wasn't tooth decay that did them in. A 9-year-old Michigan boy stumbled across something -- literally -- that, it turns out, is a mastodon tooth. ""I was walking down at the creek last summer. I felt something that I stepped on so I picked it up and everybody in the neighborhood thought it was pretty cool,"" Philip Stoll told CNN on Friday. Affectionately called ""Huckleberry Phil"" in his neighborhood near Lansing because of his penchant for exploring outside, Philip took the lump home and washed it off in the kitchen sink, and checked to see if it was magnetic, his mother, Heidi Stoll said. It wasn't. The peculiar object was about 8 inches in length, brown, and had six peaks. ""I was holding it in my hands for a few minutes and then it gave me the creeps so I put it down on the desk,"" Heidi Stoll told CNN. ""It looked like a tooth. It looked like there was something like gum tissue, a little bulgy thing around the top."" After researching ""large tooth object"" on the Internet, mother and son reached out to James Harding, a herpetologist -- an expert on reptiles and amphibians -- at nearby Michigan State, who told them it was the tooth of one of the long-gone beasts that roamed the area millennia ago. ""This is indeed a mastodon tooth,"" Professor Harding confirmed in an e-mail. ""Apparently (it is) the upper surface, broken off at the roots."" Philip told CNN that he always thought he might want to be a paleontologist -- a scientist who studies prehistoric life -- but now feels that more than ever. And with summer approaching, there's more exploring to be done. ""It's going to be hard to get him run around with shoes on or come inside to do his schoolwork,"" Stoll said of her son.","A Michigan boy exploring a creek finds what looks like a really big, really old tooth .

"(CNN) -- Skim through the photos on Flickr or Photobucket, and you'll find pictures of cats pawing at living-room sofas, children playing in backyards and mothers gardening at home. Dig a little deeper, and you can unearth the exact locations of many of those homes, embedded in data within the pictures. Images often contain a bundle of information and various traces left by digital cameras or photo manipulation software. This data, called Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF), is a key tool for many professionals. It can detail whether the photographer used a flash, which digital effects were applied to a picture and when the photo was taken. EXIF can also contain the precise GPS coordinates for where a photo was taken. This information is readily accessible and can be plugged into software such as Google Maps -- leading some security and photography experts to express concerns about amateurs unknowingly disclosing private information, such as the location of their home. ""What could go wrong with that?"" Roger Thompson, the chief research officer for digital security firm AVG, said sarcastically. Thomas Hawk, an active Flickr user and the former chief executive of competing photo site Zooomr, said EXIF is an important part of his archival process. But he has also used that data to track down someone who was harassing him online and managed to coerce an apology, he said. ""I don't geotag any pictures to my house,"" Hawk said on the phone last week. ""I think it's a huge concern. I think a lot of people don't realize or recognize what's in all of the EXIF data that they're publishing."" Most gadgets ignore the geotagging component of EXIF because relatively few cameras contain the GPS chips needed to tag them. However, many smartphones, such as those from Apple and Google's Android system, let users employ this feature. Apple's and Google's systems ask each user once or a few times for permission to access their location in order to provide additional services. If they click ""OK"" on that popup, every photo they take is tagged with GPS coordinates. Smartphones are fast becoming the camera of choice for many people. Cameras on newer phones have come to rival dedicated point-and-shoots, and many smartphone owners carry them just about everywhere. Smartphone sales have increased 50 percent since last year, according to a report by research firm Gartner. Millions of images are uploaded to Facebook using the company's iPhone, Android and BlackBerry applications. The iPhone 3G is the most popular shooter among photographers on Yahoo's Flickr website, according to a report on that site. Judging by the abundance of pictures in Flickr's database that include geolocation data in the EXIF, some smartphone owners aren't thinking twice about opting into their devices' GPS feature. Doing so can facilitate useful tools. For example, software like iPhoto and Picasa can group images by location and display them on a map. But amateur photographers may not realize that this info stays with the image when it's uploaded to Flickr, Photobucket, Picasa Web Albums and some other photo-sharing services. (Facebook says it strips the EXIF data from all photos to protect its users' privacy.) Pictures uploaded to Photobucket by one woman show her children preparing lunch and bathing in a kitchen sink. The location data, which is displayed directly on each photo's webpage, can be inputted into Google Maps to find a satellite image of her rural home in Edmond, Oklahoma. The woman couldn't be reached for comment. ""We added EXIF data a few years ago at the request of our users,"" Rob Newton, a spokesman for Photobucket, wrote in an e-mail. ""To date, we have not received any complaints from users who were previously unaware of the GPS tagging feature."" Displaying the GPS coordinates on the page can be disabled in a user's settings panel, Newton noted. However, anyone could still download the original file using a link on Photobucket and view the location info in Adobe's Photoshop or in software included with every new Mac and Windows 7 computer. Flickr's and Picasa's pages don't show the coordinates by default. But the services similarly offer links to access the original files, which can contain EXIF. ""Having the ability to download the original version of photos on Flickr is an important feature for our members,"" a Flickr spokeswoman wrote. ""However, we help people maintain their privacy by stripping the EXIF data of an image from view on the site and making the default control option to keep this information private."" Users who don't want their photos tagged with GPS data can either disable the option on their cameras or run the images through software, such as Photoshop, that can remove the EXIF. ""We realize not everyone wants to share this information with others,"" a Google spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail. She notes how to disable GPS tagging, but added: ""This is a popular Picasa feature that many people find useful."" Some photo services, including Facebook, TwitPic and Yfrog, strip EXIF once a file is uploaded and don't offer a way for users to access the original. For Yfrog, the lack of EXIF is a byproduct of automatic image optimizations done by the system, not something designed specifically with privacy in mind, Mike Harkey, a spokesman for the ImageShack-owned Yfrog site, wrote in an e-mail. While Facebook's system compresses some photos, it doesn't do so for every one. ""For those that we don't compress, we still strip out EXIF data,"" Facebook spokeswoman Jaime Schopflin wrote in an e-mail. ""We do this since users can unintentionally leak sensitive information in EXIF data."" Thompson, the security expert from AVG, commended these efforts. ""Chalk one up to Facebook for that one,"" he said. ""One of the alarming things is that every [Facebook] application wants to access your profile and your contacts and your photos. So if they weren't stripping that [EXIF data], it would be particularly alarming.""","Images can contain the precise GPS coordinates for where a photo was taken .

"Apple has set Sept. 9 as the date for a big announcement. What will the company unveil? ""Wish we could say more,"" reads an invitation sent to media members on Thursday. Multiple reports over the past few months have suggested that Apple plans to roll out two versions of an iPhone 6 this year, with screens that are 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, when measured diagonally. Is bigger really better for Apple? That would be a massive leap from the iPhone 5S and 5C's 4-inch screens and an apparent move to battle competitors like Samsung and HTC who have been making bigger phones for years. But the ""say more"" tease prompted immediate speculation that new phones might not be all that's on the agenda. The safest bet is that a long-anticipated ""iWatch"" smartwatch will be introduced as well. Apple was granted a patent for a smartwatch in July and reports have suggested now is the time for its debut. The device, which will compete with existing offerings from Samsung and other top competitors, is expected to have a heavy focus on health and fitness apps. The Apple event will be at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts, a 2,400-seat venue in the company's hometown of Cupertino, California. Apple has traditionally rolled out new iPhones in the fall, in advance of the winter holiday season.","Apple sets Sept. 9 as date for an event .

"Two women captured our hearts; both were dying of brain cancer. Both taught us to cherish life -- that nothing is greater than the human spirit. Brittany Maynard, 29, fought for the right to die with dignity. Lauren Hill, 19, fought for a dream -- to play in a college basketball game before she dies. Their stories are sad and tragic, yet inspirational, brave and beautiful. For a brief moment last weekend, both women took us away from the negative political ads blasting from our TVs and gave us the most important message of all: to enjoy our time on Earth. Maynard conveyed a stirring message about being allowed to die on her own terms; Hill's cause was infectious as she conveyed a never-give-up spirit. On Saturday, November 1, Maynard who suffered from terminal brain cancer took her last breath. She had moved to Oregon to end her life under that state's Death With Dignity Act. Before taking medication that ended her life, Maynard signed off, saying, ""Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love."" ""It is people who pause to appreciate life and give thanks who are happiest. If we change our thoughts, we change our world! Love and peace to you all."" A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, Maynard had enjoyed traveling the world before her diagnosis. ""The world is a beautiful place,"" she said. ""Travel has been my greatest teacher, my close friends and folks are the greatest givers."" She died surrounded by those who loved her most. A once taboo topic -- letting a terminally ill patient die on his or her terms -- was thrust into the spotlight. As news of her death spread, her story went viral by Sunday afternoon. Mourners tweeted and memorialized her across social media. That same day, Lauren Hill slipped on her No. 22 jersey and suited up to play basketball for Division III Mount St. Joseph. The NCAA -- not known for making speedy decisions -- moved up the team's season opener to allow Hill to play before she dies. When she was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last year, one of her doctors told her pediatric brain cancer ""needed a face,"" so she set a goal to live long enough to play in her first collegiate basketball game. In September, doctors  gave her only a few more months. She is expected to live only until December. More than 10,000 fans crammed into Cintas Center in Cincinnati on Sunday for the match against Hiram College. They wore T-shirts and sweatshirts bearing Hill's name and the slogan ""Never Give Up."" Hill told ESPN before the game: ""I've always wanted to step out on a college court, looking down at my shoes, stepping out on that wooden floor and feeling the vibration of the crowd."" On the first play of the game, Hill got the ball in the post and laid it off the glass for a bucket. The arena erupted. She would score again, ending with four points. At halftime, legendary Tennessee head coach Pat Summitt -- facing her own valiant bout with Alzheimer's -- presented Hill with the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award. The award is typically given at the end of the season during the women's Final Four. ""This game has been amazing, and everything that happened today was amazing,"" Hill said. ""This is a really good day."" The opposing coach, Emily Hays of Hiram, said, ""The look on her face was priceless. She had that big smile. I'm like, 'That's why we're here.' "" There were enough tears to fill the Ohio River. Her story caught fire on social media, too. Mortality is something we all must face. In one weekend, two women more than 2,300 miles apart reminded us what it means to be courageous.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud is dead, three Taliban sources and a government official said Tuesday. There were conflicting reports about where Mehsud died. The government official told CNN Mehsud died as a result of the January 14 attack in North Waziristan. He was seriously injured, and was moved to the Orakzai region, where he died and was buried more than a week ago, the official said, citing information from local pro-government militias. Other sources said Mehsud died near the city of Multan in central Pakistan while on his way to a treatment center in Karachi. Authorities have been looking into reports that Mehsud died after being wounded last month in a drone attack. Word of his death contradicts a statement by a Taliban spokesman last week that Mehsud was alive and in hiding. Also last week, a Pakistani news outlet reported that Mehsud had been killed. State broadcaster PTV reported that Mehsud was wounded in a drone attack this month, died and was buried. The drone attack occurred at a madrassa, or religious school, said Pakistani intelligence and local officials in North Waziristan. The school had been converted into a training camp for militants, the officials said. That attack came a few days after Mehsud appeared in a video released by the Pakistani Taliban. In it, he sits next to Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, the man thought to be the suicide bomber who killed seven CIA officers and consultants and a Jordanian army captain at a base in eastern Afghanistan on December 30. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. It was carried out to avenge the death of Mehsud's predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, who died in a suspected U.S. drone strike last year, according to al Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu Yazid. Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud are from the same tribe, not the same family. The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones, or unmanned aircraft. But the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. Journalist Nasir Dawar contributed to this report .","Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud is dead, three Taliban sources say .

"(CNN) -- One morning about 25 years ago the telephone rang at home. ""Is this Charles Kaiser?"" ""Yes."" ""Oh. Well, this is Mike Nichols, and this is one of those weird Sunday morning phone calls. You gave such a great speech at Luis' funeral. I just wondered if we could have lunch sometime."" ""Yes we could!"" I replied. Luis was Luis Sanjurjo, a remarkable character and a good friend of mine who had been an agent at International Creative Management. When he died of AIDS in 1987, Sanjurjo's clients included Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Kopit, Wallace Shawn and Benjamin Netanyahu. Before that, he had been Nichols' executive assistant. Apparently Mike had never had a chance to say a proper good-bye to our mutual friend; our lunch would be sort of a stand-in for that missing farewell. A luncheon invitation from one of the most exciting people in show business was irresistible. This was a man who had been a star of stage and film continuously since he had helped to inaugurate an eye-opening decade in 1960 with his celebrated two-person show with Elaine May on Broadway. Eventually he would win nine Tonys for his theater work, plus various Oscars, Emmys and Grammys. A few weeks later, I biked over to Nichols' house on the East Side and we went around the corner to a little Italian restaurant--and stayed there from 2 o'clock until 6 o'clock. Mike bummed one cigarette after another from the waiters, as we talked above love, sex, drugs, show business and our friend Luis. His romance with Diane Sawyer was still new, and he explained how they had met over the Atlantic on the Concorde. Sawyer was then a correspondent for ""60 Minutes,"" and she had called him a week later to ask if she could profile him for the TV show. ""No,"" said Nichols. ""But we could have dinner."" And then they were off. The prolific director of theater and film was especially pleased when I told him how much I had loved ""Streamers,"" the David Rabe play about young men going off to Vietnam that he had directed at Lincoln Center 10 years earlier, and ""The Real Thing,"" Tom Stoppard's great play about love and marriage, which won Nichols one of his Tonys for its direction. As he was for so many people my age around the world, he had been my hero since he had held up a brilliant mirror to our generation with ""The Graduate"" in 1967 (for which he won an Oscar) and before that with his astonishing debut as a film director, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""-- ""a directing debut like few others in the history of American film,"" as Frank Rich wrote on Thursday. ""Did Elizabeth Taylor give her finest performance in 'Woolf' because she was playing herself?"" I asked, over the rigatoni. ""Oh no."" Nichols replied. ""She's not a person! It's not her fault--she's been a movie star since she was 10!"" The strange thing about our lunch was, Luis Sanjurjo was gay, and I was gay, and Nichols knew that. But he peppered the conversation with odd, homophobic remarks like, ""Most gay people you know aren't really all that smart."" When we finally said good-bye after four hours of repartee, I felt I had to challenge him. ""I didn't really appreciate all those homophobic remarks,"" I said. ""Well,"" he replied, with that permanent twinkle in his eye, ""I could have made a pass at you instead."" ""Well,"" said I, ""that would have been much worse!"" After that I ran into him here and there--most recently at Nora Ephron's funeral--and he was always friendly. But we never had lunch again. Fast forward to the Golden Theatre last July. This was where Nichols had opened half a century ago in ""An Evening With Mike Nichols and Elaine May."" In this partly improvised tour de force, the two of them imitated everything from a mother pillorying her scientist son for neglecting her to a clueless nurse in a feverish emergency room. This time he was there to be interviewed onstage by Broadway director Jack O'Brien for an HBO documentary being produced by Frank Rich. O'Brien and Nichols had already done several hours of filmed interviews, but without an audience, and there hadn't been much sparkle. Only when he was in front of the packed theater did the director with the soul of a performer suddenly come alive. Nichols looked thin and rather frail, but his words were mesmerizing, and for an hour and a half his audience was spellbound. He picked up where we had left off at lunch, telling amazing stories about ""The Graduate"" and ""Virginia Woolf"": how Simon & Garfunkel had become the soundtrack for ""The Graduate"" because his brother happened to give him one of their albums while he was filming it, and he suddenly realized that several of the songs were a perfect fit for some of the scenes he had already shot. Eventually he told the singers they would have to write one song just for the movie. They demurred for just a moment, then launched into a rousing version of ""Mrs. Robinson."" ""How did you do that?"" Nichols asked. ""Well,"" Paul Simon replied, ""I'd been working on a new song: Here's to you, Mrs. Roosevelt!"" Nichols said he had only realized late in life that the plot of ""The Graduate"" was really ""PhÃ¨dre,"" the 17th century masterpiece by Jean Racine: ""a story that comes back in every generation."" He had also decided that there are only three kinds of scenes in any drama: ""seductions, negotiations and fights."" He had had to fight Jack Warner, who wanted ""Virginia Woolf"" to be made in color. But Nichols knew it had to be black and white. The most important lesson he had learned from the first movie he made was ""how beautiful black-and-white is. It's not literal. It's a metaphor automatically, already saying, this is not life, it's about life. I was excited about that."" He said one reason he had never written anything about his life was that he only knew how to print; he had never been able to write script. But he was always happy to be interviewed about his many accomplishments. When I got home that night I sent Nichols an email: ""Having had that experience once before for four hours, I knew you would be amazing. But you were more than amazing this evening. Not just a once-in-a-lifetime night in the theater: a lesson in life."" I was delighted when he wrote back: ""Thanks, Charles, for your extremely kind words. It was tricky talking about self but Jack was so generous and loving he made it ok. Glad you enjoyed it."" It turned out to be his final performance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Kaiser.","Charles Kaiser recalls two encounters with legendary director Mike Nichols .

"A new iPhone app is making waves in the commercial shipping world by providing an early warning system that aims to reduce maritime collisions with endangered whales. The Whale Alert App was launched at the start of April and produces up to the minute data regarding sightings of right whales near busy shipping lanes off the north east coast of America. The program is a collaborative effort between 13 different organizations including the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the International Fund for Animal Welfare. See also: How Flickr can help save the whales . Although there are only a handful of incidents between ships and the giant mammals each year, any collision that leads to a right whale fatality can have a major impact on the species status due to its severely depleted numbers. ""The right whale is one of the most endangered large animals on the planet, there are only between 350 to 550 of them left"" says David Wiley of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. ""If a ship strikes a reproductive female then the mortality impact could be very large in terms of what it means for the overall population,"" adds Wiley. The Whale Alert App works by collating up to the minute reports from all the organizations involved in tracking or researching right whales in the United States. See also: Rare dolphins boosted by sea sanctuary . This information is then used to pinpoint right whales straying within a five kilometer radius of major shipping lanes. Ship captains with access to the free app via their iPhone or iPad can then reduce their speed, change course or increase their vigilance so as to avoid a potential collision. ""By increasing mariners ability to comply with regulations and protective measures, you increase protection for the right whales (as well as) decreasing the chance that mariners will be fined for violating (those) regulations,"" says Wiley . ""NOAA has fined some ships up to $92,000 dollars for going too fast repeatedly in seasonal management (conservation) areas,"" he adds. See also: Activists using drones against Japanese whalers . So far there has been 9,600 downloads of the Whale Alert App from iTunes and Wiley believes the idea could also be extended to reduce shipping collisions with whales in other areas of the world. He cites the Mediterranean Sea strait where sperm whales frequently cross busy shipping lanes as well as off the coast of New Zealand where collisions with Bryde's whales are common. ""We've invented this on our own,"" says Wylie. ""But we expect it to be extremely influential in terms of creating a model for a lot of other conservation efforts.""","A new iPhone app aims to reduce collisions between endangered whales and ships .

"It might be time to slide over that Facebook app on the homescreen of your smartphone -- to make room for another Facebook app. Paper, a news-consumption app akin to existing options like Flipboard, Feedly and Zite, will be released for the iPhone in the United States on February 3, with other versions presumably to follow. The idea is to present longer-form Facebook content in a more attractive, magazine-style way that will encourage users to linger over posts, stories and images. ""Paper makes storytelling more beautiful with an immersive design and fullscreen, distraction-free layouts,"" the company said in a post on the site. ""We've also made it easier to craft and share beautiful stories of your own."" The first section of the new app will be your Facebook News Feed. It won't have all the functions of the native Facebook app, but it will present your friends' posts, along with stories from other news categories, in a slicker, prettier package. According to Facebook, the News Feed section will feature a new design for photos and video and the ability to read longer written posts. Users can then customize the app by adding more than a dozen other topics, ""from photography and sports to food, science and design."" Facebook promises ""a rich mix of content from emerging voices and well-known publications."" There will be no buttons to push. Instead, users will be able to flip through stories and other posts by tilting the phone in various ways and swiping with their fingers. When posting your own stories, Paper will let you look at a preview before sharing. Paper will be the first release from Facebook Creative Labs, which is devoted exclusively to developing new mobile apps for the site. In the early days of its 2012 public stock offering, Facebook was knocked by some for not having fully realized how to make money off of the rapidly growing mobile market. But that appears to have turned around in a big way, and Paper could give the company another mobile platform on which to advertise. On Wednesday, Facebook reported that 945 million of its 1.2 billion users visited the site via a smartphone or tablet in the last few months and that mobile represented 53% of the site's advertising revenue -- up from 23% last year and zero in 2011.","Facebook rolling out new app, Paper, on February 3 .

"Late on the night of last September 11, U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens spoke to his deputy for the final time from the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. ""Greg, we're under attack,"" Stevens told Gregory Hicks. Within hours, Stevens and three other Americans were dead, victims of an armed terrorist assault that has since become a political and foreign policy flashpoint in Washington's partisan wars. The dramatic narrative recounted by Hicks at a six-hour Republican-led House hearing on Wednesday reflected the knowledge of a high-level insider who was in Libya that long night and was deeply involved in trying to react to events. His efforts to determine the circumstances of the attack and muster help for those under siege in eastern Libya were later praised by his superiors and by President Barack Obama. The step-by-step account riveted the Oversight Committee proceeding that was also marked by sharp partisan exchanges over the merits of continued congressional inquiries over the attack. What the Obama administration has said about the Libya attack . Republicans once again accused the Obama administration of trying to cover up the fact that it was a well-orchestrated assault by militants, failing to adequately explain events to the public, and then refusing to cooperate with congressional investigators. Democrats once again accused Republicans of using tragedy for political gain. Hicks -- praised by Republicans as a ""whistleblower"" but who says he has since been effectively demoted -- was joined at the witness table by Eric Nordstrom, a former regional security officer in Libya, and Mark Thompson, the State Department's acting deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism. Our goal ""is to get answers, declared committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California.  ""The administration, however, has not been cooperative."" Hicks described in personal detail how he missed Stevens' initial call and then reached him by cell phone as the attack unfolded in phases. ""I got the ambassador on the other end and he said, 'Greg, we're under attack.'"" He recounted the efforts of a security response team on site that drove back the attackers, and ""repeated attempts"" by those on the ground to enter the burning compound to try and rescue Stevens and others. He then said that Stevens was at a hospital that was controlled by a group that he said Twitter feeds identified as leading the attack. Was it a trap to lure more Americans? Then the worst news about his boss. ""I received a call from the prime minister of Libya. I think it's the saddest phone call I've ever had in my life. He told me that Ambassador Stevens had passed away,"" Hicks said. Mother of Benghazi victim: I blame Hillary . A slow-to-evolve explanation . Oversight committee Republicans continued to go after televised remarks by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice five days after the attack. In them, she insisted it was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Islam film that turned violent. GOP critics believe Rice was shielding Obama at the height of his re-election campaign during which there were times that he trumpeted U.S. successes in combating terrorism, including the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011. Administration officials say Rice was using official talking points that relied on the best available information at the time. Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina, asked Hicks if there was any evidence early on that the attack was a protest. ""No, there was none,"" Hicks said. ""I'm confident Ambassador Stevens would have reported a protest immediately if one appeared on his door."" Hicks also said an inflammatory anti-Muslim YouTube video initially cited as a cause of the alleged protest was ""a non-event in Libya."" He previously insisted administration officials immediately knew the culprit was al Qaeda. ""I think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning,"" Hicks told investigators in interviews before the hearings. In fact, Hicks said during the hearing that he was told by the Libyan president soon afterward that elements with possible terror links were thought to be behind the assault. The veteran diplomat said his ""jaw dropped"" and he was both ""stunned"" and ""embarrassed"" when Rice said the attack was a response to the YouTube video. Boehner calls for White House to release Benghazi emails . Hicks also argued the U.S. military could have blunted the attack by scrambling intimidating military aircraft from Italy's Aviano Air Base -- an assertion denied by Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey when he testified before Congress in February. Dempsey told Congress it would take up to 20 hours to scramble the aircraft to get to Benghazi; Hicks said he believed it would take two to three hours. ""I was speaking from my perspective ... on the ground in Tripoli based on what the defense attache told me,"" Hicks said when asked by . Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Oversight panel, asked Hicks if he had any reason to question Dempsey's assertion. Finally, Hicks claimed four members of the military were ready to board a plane from Tripoli to Benghazi, but were prevented from doing so by their superiors. ""How did the personnel react at being told to stand down?"" asked Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. ""They were furious,"" said Hicks. ""I can only say, well, I will quote Lieutenant Colonel Gibson who said, 'This is the first time in my career that a diplomat has more balls than somebody in the military.'"" Pentagon officials insist the members of the military in question were told not to go to Benghazi because they were not equipped for combat, and were needed in Tripoli to care for wounded headed their way. Analysis: State Department failed to understand dangerous situation in Benghazi . Nordstrom said in written testimony it was ""inexplicable"" that a followup internal State Department review ignored ""the role senior department leadership played before, during, and after"" the attack. In the run-up to the hearing, Issa trickled out testimony from the witnesses in an apparent attempt to build anticipation for the session, one of several that have occurred in Congress focusing on security at the compound and the administration's response. Committee Democrats accused Republicans of engaging in a ""smear"" campaign. ""What we have seen ... is a full-scale media campaign that is not designed to investigate what happened in a responsible and bipartisan way but rather a launch of unfounded accusations to smear public officials,"" Cummings said. White House spokesman Jay Carney also weighed in, telling reporters that the Benghazi attack ""is a subject that has from its beginning been subject to attempts to politicize it by Republicans."" He defended defended the administration has ""made extraordinary efforts to work with"" Congress on multiple investigations. Four Americans killed in Benghazi: Why? Accusation of playing politics . For its part, the State Department also accused House Republicans of playing politics with the tragedy. ""This is not sort of a collaborative process where the committee is working directly with us in trying to establish facts that would help, you know, as we look to keep our people safe overseas in a very complex environment,"" State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said on Monday. Read the document (pdf) Wednesday's hearing is another chapter in what has become an epic back and forth between Democrats and Republicans on Benghazi, partly stemming from Rice's televised comments.  The comments are widely believed to have cost her a likely nomination to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. Some congressional Republicans previously sharply questioned Clinton over the administration's explanation of events and the state of security at the compound at the time of the attack. Clinton has said that she accepted responsibility for the deaths, declaring that as secretary of state, she was ""in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world."" In January, Clinton testified for more than five hours before the House and Senate Foreign Relations committees. In her testimony, she acknowledged a ""systematic breakdown"" on Benghazi and said her department was taking additional steps to increase U.S. security at diplomatic posts. At one point at that hearing, Clinton barely controlled her anger as she responded to a lawmaker who pressed her on the administration's post-attack storyline. Critics have questioned the validity of continued congressional scrutiny, especially Democrats, who say Republicans are only interested in discrediting the administration and hurting Clinton's chances if she were to run for president in 2016. Former deputy chief of mission in Libya: U.S. military assets told to stand down . One Republican congressman, Ohio's Jim Jordan, used the hearing to criticize top Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills. Hicks said he received a call from Mills, who he added was not happy that a State Department lawyer -- described by Republicans as a minder --  was excluded from a briefing on Benghazi in Libya with Hicks, a Republican congressman and others. Hicks has been ""praised by everybody who counts, the president, the secretary, everyone above him,"" Jordan said.  ""And yet now, they're obstructing -- because he won't -- he won't help them cover this up."" But former Clinton aide Philppe Reines disputed that characterization, saying the State Department took a cooperative approach with Congress. He said in a written statement that Mills had, in fact, called Hicks to support him. ""She wanted (people on the ground in Libya) to know that no matter how far away they were from home, they weren't alone,"" Reines said.  ""She was with them, and most importantly (Secretary Clinton) was with them.""","State Department official says he never believed the attack was a protest .

"Susie Kalimnios has traveled thousands of miles for two spectacular minutes. The mother of three from Montauk, New York, is in Australia for what she's hoping will be ""the experience of a lifetime."" She has made a pilgrimage to Australia's remote Far North Queensland region to witness a total solar eclipse. For just a few ethereal minutes on the morning of November 14, the nation's northernmost tip will be plunged in to complete darkness, as the moon aligns precisely between the earth and the sun. Kalimnios will certainly not be alone. Despite the relatively secluded viewing location, up to 60,000 eclipse chasers are expected to descend on the region and a flurry of eclipse-themed events -- from hot air balloon rides to snorkling expeditions -- are in store to mark the occasion. For her part, Kalimnios will be running in the Solar Eclipse Marathon, a race that begins the moment the first shard of light emerges from behind the moon -- creating what the event organizers describe as an ""intergalactic starting gun."" ""It is the combination of the solar eclipse and the marathon that made this a must-do for me,"" Kalimnios says. ""This is only going to happen once and (it's) an experience I'll never ever be able to do again."" More from CNN Celebrates: The many customs of Diwali . Keith Mansfield, an author from London, is making the journey so he can finally experience a ""proper total eclipse."" A self-described space geek, Mansfield is the author of the Johnny Mackintosh books -- a children's series he describes as ""Harry Potter in space."" Mansfield witnessed a total eclipse of the sun in Cornwall in the UK in 1999, but it was cloudy. Even though conditions weren't the best, the memory remained with him, and he's been waiting to experience that moment of complete darkness ever since. ""It's just a remarkable coincidence that the moon is exactly the same size in the sky as the sun. What are the chances of that?"" Wonders Mansfield, whose viewing perch will be the luxuriously tropical Fitzroy Island adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef. Rick Brown, a commodities trader from New York who's been hooked on eclipses since he saw one first in 1970, is part of the tourism boom. He's been leading eclipse safaris all over the world for two decades. This year, he's guiding a group of about 50 in Australia, marking his 13th tour. A one-man show, Brown personally handles all the tour arrangements, from restaurants to lodging to the all-important viewing point.  His group will watch the eclipse from a beach just outside the picturesque town of Port Douglas. With a large group, the anticipation leading up to the event is a big part of the fun, he says. ""There's a lot of excitement that builds up before the first moment when the moon kisses the sun."" And while ""totality is probably the fastest few minutes you can probably live through,"" the short duration doesn't minimize the experience. ""It's a phenomenal thing to see,"" he says. More from CNN Celebrates: Take the Diwali quiz . Tours like Brown's are part of a growing eclipse tourism industry that encompasses everything from luxury cruises to music and art festivals. All the activity provides a nice economic boost. The Cairns Regional Council estimates the eclipse will inject 75 million Australian dollars (about 75 million USD) into the local economy and add nearly 400 jobs. If there's anyone who's been a witness to the rise in eclipse tourism over the years, it's Jay Pasachoff, a professor of astronomy at Williams College who will be viewing his 56th solar eclipse. Nowadays, people who want to see an eclipse will travel to do so, he says. ""It's the most remarkable spectacle that anyone can see. I remember each of the eclipses I've seen. Each one has its own story."" A total eclipse of the sun isn't just a striking experience, he notes, but also a rare opportunity for scientists to learn more about the sun and the universe. ""Scientifically there are special things we can study on the sun that we can't observe at any other time,"" says Pasachoff, who will use the few minutes of totality to learn more about the motion and structure of the corona, the sun's outer atmosphere. Whether a first-time stargazer or a veteran astronomer, there's something all eclipse watchers in Australia are hoping for: clear weather. Overcast skies diminish visibility, but if the clouds remain at bay, a thrilling and unforgettable moment awaits.","A total solar eclipse will occur on November 14 over northern tip of Australia .

"Washington (CNN) -- AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka has a blunt message for labor union members: Get to the polls next week, because ""as bad as things are, they can get a whole lot worse."" As part of a massive get-out-the-vote operation, the labor federation is sending out 10 million personalized letters from Trumka as a final mailing to its membership Monday. Enclosed with each letter is a detailed ""slate card"" tailored to each member. It lists all of the state-wide candidates endorsed by labor, as well as the candidates for the House of Representatives and the state legislature. The card includes the person's polling place and information about what kind of identification they may need to bring. Trumka penned two letters Monday, each with a different message, which the union's spokesman called ""the most sophisticated [get-out-the-vote] mail program the AFL-CIO has ever done."" The union uses ""micro targeting"" analysis to pinpoint the issues union members care about and that, in turn, determines which letter they will receive. In one version, Trumka warns his members that if the Republicans win control of Congress they will privatize Social Security, send jobs to China, cut off any future extensions of unemployment benefits and let insurance companies take away health care coverage. The letter closes by saying, ""get mad and do something about it."" The other personalized letter from Trumka echoes the message President Barack Obama and Democrats have focused on over the past few weeks: undisclosed outside money is fueling an onslaught of television ads and distorting the records of pro-union candidates. This letter links the foreign money theme with the Democrats' other message on the economy: that big businesses are planning to outsource U.S. jobs. Trumka writes, ""The same foreign companies that are stealing American jobs are now trying to buy our American elections."" Including this mailing, the AFL-CIO has sent out 28.6 million pieces of political literature this midterm cycle. The labor federation also has call centers in 26 states that have high union membership and competitive congressional and statewide races. For example, in Ohio, there are 17 call centers where members are contacting fellow labor workers urging them to vote a week from Tuesday. Volunteers are leafleting work sites and doing neighborhood walks to encourage people to turn out. While the AFL-CIO is not funding television ads on behalf of candidates, its largest member, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Workers, is putting tens of millions of dollars into ads. A spokesman for the AFL-CIO declined to give a figure for how much the get-out-the-vote effort is costing, saying the organization doesn't want to give away any information to the other side about the extent of its efforts.","The union's president wrote a pair of letters to members .

"What if Facebook spent $19 billion on something and most people never noticed? The social media giant dropped that mind-boggling amount Wednesday on WhatsApp, paying 19 times more than it did for Instagram (or the gross national product of some small countries, if you prefer) for a texting app that most folks in the United States had never even heard of. So what will this mean for the average Facebook user, or fans of WhatsApp, which lets users send unlimited messages for no more than 99 cents a year? In the hours after the deal became public, the prevailing opinion appeared to be, ""Not much."" ""WhatsApp will continue to operate independently within Facebook,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote Wednesday. ""The product roadmap will remain unchanged and the team is going to stay in Mountain View,"" the suburban California city where it's based. Zuckerberg also said that Messenger, Facebook's chat app, and WhatsApp will remain separate. So what's the deal? Well, first, Facebook has demonstrated a willingness to scoop up successful mobile apps (a space where it's weak compared to rivals Google and Apple, with their own operating systems and stores) then largely leave them alone. Witness Instagram, which Facebook bought in 2012 for $1 billion. Active users were wary of the buyout, with some threatening to leave. Since then, the photo app's number of active users has more than doubled, even with the carefully crafted introduction of ads, which some people feared would junk up Instagram's user experience. WhatsApp has 450 million active users worldwide and is reportedly adding millions more each month on a path Zuckerberg and others believe will soon have it hitting the 1 billion mark. And that's probably where Facebook is really looking. While it may be lightly regarded in the U.S., where unlimited texting plans are the norm, WhatsApp has taken off in emerging markets like India, where traditional text-messaging can get expensive. WhatsApp is free to download and costs a mere 99 cents per year after the first  year. ""(T)here's no other homegrown technology company that's so widely loved overseas and so under appreciated at home,"" wrote Jim Goetz of Sequoia Capital, the primary investor in WhatsApp. With growth beginning to plateau in the United States, Facebook obviously is looking to places like India to keep growing. Zuckerberg also believes WhatsApp will help with the company's internet.org initiative -- an effort to provide Web access to the two-thirds of the world's population that doesn't yet have it. ""Our mission is to make the world more open and connected,"" he wrote. ""We do this by building services that help people share any type of content with any group of people they want. WhatsApp will help us do this by continuing to develop a service that people around the world love to use every day."" Bringing in WhatsApp also creates a whole new brain trust for Facebook as it develops future mobile products. For a while, Facebook struggled with how to make money in the emerging mobile landscape. Investors have increasingly warmed to its stock as the company has shown more and more comfort in the mobile space, where an ever increasing number of users access its products. So, if all signs point to Facebook remaining Facebook and WhatsApp remaining WhatsApp, there's not much for users to be concerned about, right? Well. Have you ever been on the Internet? The move was met with predictable skepticism, much like the 2012 Instagram buyout and, really, almost any time a beloved tech startup gets gobbled up by one of the industry's big-money behemoths. ""Facebook is like an evil parent that keeps finding the new hiding place for your diary,"" Twitter user Shannon Self wrote, referring to the site's habit of buying out emerging communication tools. ""Facebook bought #Whatsapp ... Please be checking the security settings now ... too many scandals are about to break out. Damn!"" added Hemanth Kumar, a journalist from India's Hyderabad Times. Joked Rob Forbes, a DJ with South African radio station 5FM: ""Waking up to the news that Mark Zuckerburg now owns all your nudes. Again.""","Facebook's major purchase might not change much for users .

"If reports Wednesday are to be believed, one of the tech industry's biggest deals in recent history was hammered out almost exclusively by two 20-somethings over the course of what amounts to a long weekend. On April 8, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg let the company's board of directors know he was about to spend $1 billion on hot photo start-up Instagram -- just hours before the deal was done, according to the Wall Street Journal. The deal was nailed down, unnamed sources told the Journal, in only three days. Meetings between Zuckerberg, 27, and Instagram head Kevin Systrom, 28, that took place at Zuckerberg's multi-million-dollar Palo Alto, California, home. It's a move that shows Zuckerberg displaying the hacker spirit that helped him launch a social-media juggernaut in his college dorm room. And that's a spirit that doesn't always jibe with the image of  CEO of a corporation expected to be valued at up to $100 billion when it makes its first public stock offering in the next few weeks. ""On balance, I'm not sure it's the best way to do business,"" said Ali Velshi, CNN's chief business correspondent. ""But Mark Zuckerberg has defied all rules."" The moxie suggested in the report comes at an interesting time for Facebook and Zuckerberg, who also reportedly whittled down Systrom's initial asking price of $2 billion. On the brink of offering up Facebook, with its hundreds of millions of users, to stockholders, even Zuckerberg's controlling interest in the company (a 57% share of voting rights, according to reports) could soon need to be checked by the types of lawyers, bean-counters and other business types whose jobs involve looking out for a company's bottom line. ""This paints a complex picture of its CEO as at once confident and bold, and also nervous and panicky -- details that will be scrutinized come Facebook's imminent IPO,"" Kit Eaton wrote on Fast Company's website. Velshi, who over the course of his career covered the ""tech bubble"" of the late 1990s, said the whirlwind purchase may, in fact, be a last hurrah of sorts for Zuckerberg. ""It actually happens more than we think. And it's not a bad thing, particularly in non-public companies, Velshi said. ""But, in public companies, boards are important -- they are supposed to protect shareholder interests, and they are supposed to bring perspective and experience that a kid CEO may not have."" The Facebook board did vote to approve the deal, according to the Journal. But at that point, it was largely an endorsement more than a decision. The board, one source said, ""was told, not consulted."" In the fast-moving world of Web tech, being nimble is almost a prerequisite for survival. Fail to adapt and someone else will pass you by. Instagram, a mobile app which lets users enhance their photos with a raft of pre-created filters, was reportedly on the verge of nailing down a new round of private investments worth $50 million. Could that have made Zuckerberg overpay for a company with 13 employees and no revenue to date? Maybe, says Velshi. ""Creativity, innovation and deal-making are different strengths; rarely does one person possess all of them,"" he said. ""That Zuckerberg felt strongly that he wanted Instragram may not have made him the best person to do the deal -- that's why we have real estate agents, or talent agents."" For what it's worth, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg was aware of the negotiations all along, although she didn't personally take part. And, for Facebook, making a profit directly from Instagram may have been less important than locking up its user data and taking a rapidly growing competitor, now with more than 40 million users, off of the playing field. Regardless of where the future takes Facebook -- whether life as a publicly traded commodity is more about stuffy board meetings than spur-of-the moment handshake deals -- Wednesday's report provided at least one more glimpse at the hoodie-wearing, authority-flouting CEO whose origin story has literally become the stuff of Hollywood storytelling.

"By day, Scott Loeser works from home for a company based in Hong Kong, selling stationery and school supplies to American big-box retailers. In the afternoon, he rides a bus about 30 minutes from St. Paul, Minnesota, to a studio where he makes small leather goods by hand in the hopes of one day selling them for his own company. Before he can do that, though, he figures he needs to know how to use a sewing machine and make a scalable product. ""I want to be the guy selling stuff to Asian companies instead of selling for them,"" said Loeser, 35, whose background is product development, sales and retail branding. ""I want to make a name for myself, but even if I have a product that's successful and great, how cool would it be if I could also say that I sew my own product?"" To get closer to his dream, Loeser enrolled in a ""sewing and production specialist"" course at Dunwoody College of Technology in Minneapolis, where he'll learn the basics of sewing in an industrial setting and the production process. The program includes on-the-job training and a paid internship with a company in the Twin Cities region that could lead to a full-time job. Upon completion of the 22-week program, which began in January, he'll earn a certificate in industrial sewing through Dunwoody. It may not sound like the sexiest gig ever, but Loeser is one of 18 students who see the program as a ticket to a brighter future. Ranging in age from 18 to 64, their reasons for joining are as varied as their backgrounds. Some are lifelong Midwesterners, but nearly half are legal immigrants from as far as Somalia, Myanmar and Mexico. Some of them want to make use of a skill they utilized in their homeland or find a steady job that keeps them off their feet; others, such as Loeser, see a path to entrepreneurialism. Made in America markets create communities of like-minded consumers . That the class exists is a testament to the growing demand for a trade considered nearly obsolete in the last decades of the 20th century. The last time Dunwoody offered a cutting and sewing class was in the 1940s before it was dropped because of a lack of industry demand, said Debra Kerrigan, dean of workforce training and continuing education. Fast forward six decades and the demand for a skilled cut and sew industry has returned to Minnesota, home to about 8,000 manufacturing companies, many in desperate need of a workforce trained in trades lost in an era of outsourcing and automation. Read more: The high-tech return of high school shop class . ""Dying trades are coming back to life,"" Kerrigan said. ""Companies are looking for people with the right skills and people want to recareer and get back into the work force, and they want to do it quickly."" Birth of a movement . Sure, there are online sewing tutorials and workshops at community centers or crafts stores for hobbyists. Colleges also offer degrees in fashion design and manufacturing and apparel technology. But organizers of the course say its specific focus on skilled sewing certification makes it unique -- and cheaper for students since it's not a course for credits. The genesis of the course also makes it unique. Representatives from companies that historically manufactured in Minnesota  got together in January 2012 and realized they had a shared need for skilled labor that could work with a variety of materials, from clothing and shoes to medical supplies, tarps, banners and HVAC vents. Spearheaded by Jennifer Guarino, CEO of luggage maker J.W. Hulme, the coalition moved fast once it identified common goals, reaching out to Dunwoody to create a curriculum suiting their needs and LifeTrack, a nonprofit human services organization that helps job seekers. Thus was born the Makers Coalition, which bills itself as ""a hands-on movement to rebuild the industrial sewing heritage of America"" through the collaborative efforts of businesses and industry, educational institutions and nonprofits. The coalition represents a variety of sectors: established accessory and apparel brands like J.W. Hulme, Red Wing and Allen Edmonds; independent designers of bridal collections, dance recital costumes and lingerie; cut and sew facilities and makers of industrial sewing machines. The story of J.W. Hulme, a heritage brand that has been making bags and accessories in its St. Paul facility for more than 100 years, mirrors the experience of other coalition members. The brand relies on a skilled workforce that's rapidly approaching retirement age in a time when it has begun to see dramatic growth, thanks to swelling brand awareness and interest in American-made goods. Made in America: The short list . ""The more we've grown, the more we've found it very, very difficult to find skilled labor to stay at capacity,"" Guarino said. ""We lost a whole generation of skilled labor, so we have to jump-start training again. We're the guardians of our trade and, if we don't, it will go away."" The coalition has a nonprofit arm that provides partial funding for scholarships and materials for the course. Additional funding for scholarships, which 16 of the 18 students receive, came from a $75,000 grant awarded to LifeTrack from the Greater Twin Cities United Way's WINGs Giving Community. Beyond training a skilled workforce, Guarino says the larger vision for the coalition is to create a cut and sew industry in the Twin Cities that compares to those in New York and Los Angeles. But to do so, it needs to convince people that these aren't dead-end jobs -- that they have opportunities for advancement, especially as current workers retire. A chance to start fresh . The program has its share of creative types in their 20s and 30s looking for alternatives to corporate life. Rhea O'Connor, 34, already has a full-time job in Web design. She decided to enroll in the program's night classes so she'd have a skill that would allow her to potentially change careers. ""I want to actually be able to sew in way that I can produce something from the production standpoint instead of just creating a one-off,"" she said. Other students are approaching middle age and looking for a chance to start fresh. Marcus Cook, 47, has held his share of jobs in telecommunications and the service industry; in darker days, he served time in prison for robbery. But, that's all behind him, he says. Now, he's engaged and has monthly bills, child support and a daughter looking to go to college. He sees the course as a ticket to getting his life back on track in an industry that appears to be growing. Plus, after more than a decade working on his feet in kitchens, it satisfies his desire to be creative in a job that won't require him to stand all day. ""I'm still 20 years from retirement so I took this as an opportunity to learn a trade that will give me another notch in my belt and keep me employed,"" he said. ""I don't see this industry becoming totally automated and robotic; there will always be a human application to it."" Scott Loeser also enjoys making things with his hands, which is why he got into leather-making in the first place. And, if growing consumer interest in the ""made in USA"" trend translates to a real revival of American manufacturing jobs, he wants to be at the forefront. Running his own successful leather goods business is the ultimate goal -- he already has a name for it, Marked. But, in the short term, he simply wants to learn a marketable trade that interests him. ""The desire for made in USA is out there, the problem is there's no one to make it, which is a need this program is filling,"" he said. ""I want to be part of a movement that makes factory work cool and sexy again.""","Sewing and cutting class draws job-seekers from various backgrounds .

"(CNN) -- Johnny Grant, Hollywood's honorary mayor, was found dead Wednesday night, Los Angeles police said. Grant, 84, appeared to have died of natural causes.

"(CNN) -- She's a drummer, a producer, a vocalist and a mom. Terri Lyne Carrington knows a lot about transformation. In fact, ""Transformation"" is the title of the first track on Carrington's Grammy-nominated CD, ""The Mosaic Project."" The vocals on the track ""Transformation"" are performed by Nona Hendryx, perhaps best known from her days as part of Labelle, the singing group from the '70s that helped launch the career of the iconic singer Patti LaBelle. Carrington explained the song was originally written and recorded by Hendryx in the 1980s. ""I remember growing up listening to it and it was always a song I felt connected to on some level,"" Carrington said. In later years the two performed together and Carrington said when she started to put ""The Mosaic Project"" together, she thought, ""Why don't we do a jazz version of 'Transformation'?"" The song varies quite a bit from the original and Carrington said she wasn't sure Hendryx would even like her arrangement. She said when she played it for Hendryx, ""First she had to really get used to it and then she ended up really loving it and she sang it great as well."" ""The Mosaic Project"" is Carrington's fifth album. A child prodigy, she has toured with some of the greatest names in jazz over the past two decades, including luminaries such as Herbie Hancock, Dizzy Gillespie, Al Jarreau, Joe Sample and Stan Getz. In fact, Carrington, now 46, was only 11 years old when she performed with drummer Buddy Rich on a television show, impressing him with her clean technique and solid coordination. She said ""The Mosaic Project"" makes her feel, ""a little bit like a trailblazer,"" because when she was a kid starting out there weren't any other female drummers that she knew of and only a few female instrumentalists. ""It's good to see a lot of younger women not having any preconceived notions about what they can do,"" Carrington said. ""It seems normal for a lot of them to play male-dominated instruments and I think that's a beautiful thing. Everything about this recording is about making a larger picture out of many various elements."" To that end, she gathered most of her closest friends (who happen to be great musicians and great singers) and had them help out with the project. Carrington said she envisioned the project for awhile, then ""...it came together. The stars aligned and everybody was on board, so I was very fortunate."" Included in that list of ""friends"" are some of the most prominent female jazz artists of the last few decades, including, besides Hendryx: Esperanza Spalding, Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Sheila E., Cassandra Wilson, Geri Allen and more. The 14-song set weaves a story of transformation, using everything from jazz to hip hop to the spoken word. Civil rights and women's rights activist Angela Davis introduces a track called ""Echo,"" which Carrington said brings together three women who have been very influential in her development as a black woman and ""just figuring out who I am."" Those three are: Bernice Johnson Reagon of the group ""Sweet Honey In The Rock,"" who originally wrote the song, Reeves, who performs the vocals, and Davis. Carrington said she's most proud of that song. Listeners might be surprised to learn ""The Mosaic Project"" also includes a cover of the Beatles classic ""Michelle."" Carrington makes no secret of her affinity for the Beatles' music. On her last CD, ""More to Say,"" she covered ""Let it Be."" Carrington said she wrote the arrangement of ""Michelle"" a few years back and played it live, but this seemed like the right time to record it. ""I'm already thinking about the next Beatles song"" she said with a chuckle. Drumsticks in hand, Carrington is helping trumpet the joys of jazz to new generations and new audiences and she's optimistic about its future. ""It's a high art form,"" she said. ""I don't think it's going anywhere."" She said people often ask her if jazz is dead. ""I still put on the classic jazz and it's still very much alive,"" she said. ""What's happening is it morphs and changes. But the library that's being created under the umbrella of jazz is incredible and it's just more and more music that people will have access to.""","""The Mosaic Project"" is Terri Lyne Carrington's fifth album .

"Nearly a third of the world's economic output will come from countries facing ""high"" to ""extreme"" risks from the impacts of climate change within 12 years, according to a new report. The Climate Change Vulnerability Index, an annual report produced by UK-based risk analysis firm Maplecroft, found that climate change ""may pose a serious obstacle to sustainable economic growth in the world's most commercially important cities."" The index ranked the vulnerability of the world's countries, and the 50 cities deemed most economically important, to the impacts of climate change, by evaluating their risk of exposure to extreme climate events, the sensitivity of their populations to that exposure and the adaptive capacity of governments to respond to the challenge. READ MORE: Australian bushfires inflame climate change debate . It said the combined GDP of the 67 countries classed as facing ""high"" or ""extreme"" risks was projected to nearly triple from $15 trillion to $44 trillion by 2025 -- meaning nearly a third of the global economy would be coming under increasing threat from extreme climate-related events. It projected the population of those countries -- currently estimated at more than 4.5 billion -- could exceed 5 billion by 2025. The index's findings bore particularly bad news for Bangladesh, which topped both lists, with its capital, Dhaka, ranked the most vulnerable city due to its exposure to threats such as flooding, storm surge, cyclones and landslides, its susceptible population and weak institutional capacity to address the problem. Along with the Bangladeshi capital, the four other cities categorized as facing ""extreme risk"" from climate change impacts were also located in Asia -- Mumbai, Manila, Kolkata and Bangkok -- and projected to be centers of high economic growth. ""The combined GDP in these cities is forecast to almost triple from US$275 billion to US$804 billion by 2025, representing the greatest combined growth in any of the risk categories,"" said the report, released Wednesday. The figures, it said, underlined the way in which ""cities with some of the biggest economic growth potential are among those with the greatest vulnerability to climate change."" Greenpeace's chief scientist Doug Parr said the report highlighted ""just how urgent the need is for the international community to tackle climate change."" ""Without a binding global agreement the economic and social impact of global warming will be devastating,"" he said. ""It would be morally negligent for countries with large emissions to ignore the mounting evidence of the impact global warming that shows that some of the poorest nations on the planet will be hit hardest, while those nations who are seeing the first signs of economic growth after years of stagnation will see those gains washed away by consequences of global warming."" READ MORE: Annual temperatures to reach new highs within a generation . On a national level, many global growth markets were extremely vulnerable to climate change, the report said, with important markets such as Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Vietnam and the Philippines all joining Bangladesh in the ""extreme risk"" category. Bangladesh was followed on the list of most vulnerable countries by Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Haiti, South Sudan, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cambodia, the Philippines and Ethiopia. The vulnerability of many African countries -- which accounted for 14 of the 20 most at-risk nations -- was partly due to their natural susceptibility to extreme climate-related events such as floods, droughts, fires, storms or landslides. But it was also a consequence of the vulnerability of the population, and the inadequacies of existing infrastructure to adapt to or tackle the problem, due to weak economies, governance, education and healthcare. Countries in south and southeast Asia, which accounted for one-third of all ""extreme"" risk nations, were likely to face an increased risk of severe flooding due to projected changes in seasonal rainfall. These would also increase the likelihood of summer droughts, and in turn, declining crop yields. The most susceptible populations in these areas were in areas with high levels of poverty, and where large populations had clustered on marginal land such as flood plains or coastal regions in cyclone-prone areas. READ MORE: 'Extremely likely' humans responsible for climate change . While the majority of small, developing, island nations faced extreme levels of exposure to climate-related events, their populations and infrastructures were deemed less ""sensitive,"" and were therefore generally not considered to be at ""extreme"" risk overall. One exception was Haiti, where poor healthcare access, weak infrastructure, high levels of poverty and an over-reliance on agriculture placed the country into the ""extreme"" category. Maplecroft's head of environment, James Allan, said that identifying where the risks of climate change were going to be highest was ""now an imperative for both business and governments."" ""Framing the risks in economic terms makes the issue harder to ignore, especially for business, and it may prompt better preparedness planning,"" he said. ""Nothing prompts corporate or political action faster than having to deal with the aftermath of an extreme climate event."" London and Paris were the only two cities ranked as ""low risk,"" while Iceland, followed by Norway and Ireland, were the least vulnerable countries. In September, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its latest assessment report, a benchmark study on global warming involving the efforts of nearly 1,000 researchers around the world. It expressed widespread, rising confidence among scientists the climate is warming, that humans are responsible for at least half of the increase in temperatures since the 1950s.","Climate change may be ""serious obstacle"" to sustainable growth in key cities, says report .

"(CNN) -- Edin Dzeko is a man on a mission -- and it's not just about winning the World Cup. Bosnia's qualification for Brazil 2014 created joyous scenes on the streets of Sarajevo as 50,000 people turned out to celebrate last October. Its players have become heroes and will travel to South America hoping to do the nation proud on its debut on the world's biggest football stage. But any thoughts of World Cup success have been placed on hold following the worst floods in the Balkans region for over 120 years. ""I think it's important for the people, for the world, to know this is not a game,"" Dzeko, who has appealed for help on Twitter, told CNN. ""This is something serious. So many people have lost their lives, lost their homes. ""They were trying to build something for themselves and for their kids over the past 20 years and they've lost it just like that."" The floods have wreaked destruction on parts of Croatia and Serbia too, while Bosnian president Bakir Izetbegovic confirmed to CNN that the flooding has left billions of dollars worth of damage. At least 13 people have died during the natural disaster in Bosnia, while there have been deaths in Serbia too. ""I want the whole world, not just the people in Bosnia and Serbia, to know,"" added Dzeko, who plays for English Premier League champion Manchester City. ""If anyone could help Bosnia and Serbia in any way, it would be amazing."" While Dzeko has taken to social media to ask for help, humanitarian organizations have begun to arrive. The Red Cross estimates around 50,000 people throughout the country are without safe water and electricity, while it claims ""many are living in unsafe and insanitary conditions created by the floods."" A state of emergency has been declared in 14 municipalities, according to the Red Cross, while landslides have caused havoc. The World Food Program has already announced plans to send enough aid to help 150,000 in Bosnia's most-affected areas. One of the most damaged sectors of Bosnian trade is its crop production, and the recent floods have left farms and agricultural land decimated.","Bosnia-Herzegovina striker Edin Dzeko appeals for aid to help flood victims .

"It is spacious, contemporary and livable. There are stainless steel appliances, hardwood floors, and the bedrooms are painted a soothing green. Stately columns convey ""comfortable suburban."" A savvy realtor could market it as ""The Woodlands"" model or ""The Retreat."" But when the owner of a super-energy efficient house in the Maryland suburbs is the U.S. government, you bet the name will leave you scratching your head. The welcome mat reads: ""Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility,"" or NZERTF. Built on the campus of a national technology testing site, the ""Net-Zero House"" is the nation's newest science lab. Government scientists and engineers will use the 2,700 square-foot home as a test-bed to develop ways to measure products, materials and systems that make a house energy efficient and green. They aim to demonstrate that an attractive home for a family of four can be ""net-zero energy"" -- meaning it produces as much energy annually as it consumes. ""What we wanted to do was show that it's possible to do in homes typical in size, with the aesthetics and features of a home in a metropolitan area,"" said A. Hunter Fanney, chief of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Energy and Environment Division. Buildings are an often overlooked part of the U.S. quest for energy independence, Fanney said. Residential buildings consume 22 percent of the nation's energy and commercial buildings eat up another 18 percent, he said. Making homes more efficient, proponents say, will help reduce the country's dependence on energy imports and cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. Turning up the heat to drive down carbon emissions and energy bills . Fanney and other experts say that ways to measure systems in the complex environment of a home are lacking. Their solution: this project. The ""Net-Zero-House"" was built using commercially available products and constructed to exacting specifications to make it air and water tight. It bristles with state-of-the-art technology, including photovoltaic panels on the upper roof to convert sunlight to electricity and solar thermal panels on a lower roof to heat water. Three types of geothermal systems use ground temperatures to heat the house in the winter or cool it in the summer. Radiant heating is embedded in the floors. Both conventional and high velocity duct systems distribute air. The house also has a ""smart"" electrical system. ""I'd love to live in this house. It has all the amenities,"" Fanney said, adding that it will be ""extremely comfortable."" But who will actually live in it? Meet ""the Nisters"" -- a ""virtual family"" scientists created to help simulate the impact of real people on the house. The ""Nisters"" simulate two working adults and children, ages 14 and 8. Devices in various rooms will mimic them, emitting heat and humidity at appropriate times, while sensors record conditions. ""Every movement of their lives has been scripted. Lights will go on and off; showers will take place,"" said Fanney. ""Appliances will be turned on and off just as a family of four would use them."" ""The reason they're not real people is we want to have control,"" he said. ""With real people, we all live randomly, so it's very difficult to have this control in place."" Meanwhile, scientists in the detached garage will monitor conditions. CNNMoney: Can the Navy really go green? Approximately $2.5 million has been spent on the house using federal stimulus money. As a condition of the stimulus funds, almost all of the house was built using American materials and products. The lone exception -- a ventilation device in the basement -- was made in Canada. No similar device is made in the United States, the laboratory said. What will happen to the house once tests are completed? ""I don't think that we'll ever be finished with this facility,"" said Fanney. He envisions new energy technology ""for the next three or four decades."" And he suspects that the research will allow homebuilders to advertise a house's energy efficiency. ""Buildings will have an energy label on them much as cars have a 'miles per gallon' label today,"" he said. TIME: Pro Sports Go Green.

"When Richard Mourdock delivered his notorious answer about rape and abortion, I was sorry that the debate moderator failed to follow up with the next question: . ""OK, Mr. Mourdock, you say your principles require a raped woman to carry the rapist's child to term. That's a heavy burden to impose on someone. What would you do for her in return? Would you pay her medical expenses? Compensate her for time lost to work? Would you pay for the child's upbringing? College education? ""If a woman has her credit card stolen, her maximum liability under federal law is $50. Yet on your theory, if she is raped, she must endure not only the trauma of assault, but also accept economic costs of potentially many thousands of dollars. Must that burden also fall on her alone? When we used to draft men into the Army, we gave them veterans' benefits afterward. If the state now intends to conscript women into involuntary childbearing, surely those women deserve at least an equally generous deal?"" That question sounds argumentative, and I suppose it is. Opinion: Mourdock's rape remark and extremism . But there's a serious point here, and it extends well beyond the anguishing question of sexual assault. If you're serious about reducing abortion, the most important issue is not which abortions to ban. The most important issue is how will you support women to have the babies they want. As a general rule, societies that do the most to support mothers and child-bearing have the fewest abortions. Societies that do the least to support mothers and child-bearing have more abortions. Germany, for example, operates perhaps the world's plushest welfare state. Working women receive 14 weeks of maternity leave, during which time they receive pay from the state. The state pays a child allowance to the parents of every German child for potentially as many as 25 years, depending on how long as the child remains in school. Women who leave the work force after giving birth receive a replacement wage from the state for up to 14 months. Maybe not coincidentally, Germany has one of the lowest abortion rates, about one-third that of the United States. Yet German abortion laws are not especially restrictive. Abortion is legal during the first trimester of pregnancy and available if medically or psychologically necessary in the later trimesters. Even here in the United States, where parental benefits are much less generous, abortion responds to economic conditions. In the prosperous 1990s, abortion rates declined rapidly. In the less prosperous '00s, abortion rates declined more slowly. When the economy plunged into crisis in 2008, abortion rates abruptly rose again. These trends should not surprise anyone. Women choose abortion for one overwhelming reason: economic insecurity. The large majority of women who chose abortion in 2008, 57%, reported a disruptive event in their lives in the previous 12 months: most often, the loss of a job or home. Obama on Mourdock: Male politicians shouldn't make abortion decisions . Of the women who choose abortion, 58% are in their 20s. Some 61% of them already have a child. Almost 70% of them are poor or near poor. Three-quarters say they cannot afford another child. Pro-life and pro-choice debaters delight in presenting each other with exquisitely extreme moral dilemmas: ""Would you ban abortion even in case of rape?"" ""Would you permit abortion even when done only to select the sex of the child?"" These dorm-room hypotheticals do not have very much to do with the realities of abortion in the U.S. and elsewhere. Here's an interesting example of those realities: The Netherlands has one of the the most liberal abortion laws in the world. Yet for a long time, the Netherlands also reported one of the world's lowest abortion rates. That low incidence abruptly began to rise in the mid-1990s. Between 1996 and 2003, the abortion rate in the Netherlands jumped by 31% over seven years. What changed? The Guttmacher Institute, the leading source of data on reproductive health worldwide, cites ""a growing demand for terminations from women in ethnic minority groups residing in the country."" Well over half of all abortions performed on teenagers in the Netherlands are performed on girls of non-Dutch origins. These girls and women weren't being raped. They weren't selecting for the sex of their child. They chose abortion because they had become sexually active within male-dominated immigrant subcultures in which access to birth control was restricted, in which female sexuality was tightly policed, in which girls who become pregnant outside marriage are disgraced and in which the costs and obligations of childbearing loaded almost entirely on women alone. Abortion is a product of poverty and maternal distress. A woman who enjoys the most emotional and financial security and who has chosen the timing of her pregnancy will not choose abortion, even when abortion laws are liberal. A woman who is dominated, who is poor and who fears bearing the child is likely to find an abortion, even where abortion is restricted, as it was across the United States before 1965. Santorum: Mourdock criticism 'gotcha politics' So maybe at the next candidates' debate, a journalist will deflect the discussion away from ""what if"" and instead ask this: . ""Rather than tell us what you'd like to ban, tell us please what you think government should do to support more happy and healthy childbearing, to reduce unwanted pregnancies and to alleviate the economic anxieties of mothers-to-be?"" Those are the questions that make the difference. It's amazing how little we talk about them.","David Frum: People often neglect the economic reasons behind the choice to have an abortion .

"He revered friendship; he loved food, and Israel, and gay people, and he adored New York City.  He also loved himself. When Edward Irving Koch died early Friday morning in a New York hospital at  age  88, it had been almost a quarter of a century since he had left office.   But he never faded away.  He stayed relevant until his last breath, and he had kept the ear of every important Democrat, from Barack Obama to the lowliest city councilman. As much as his hero, Fiorello LaGuardia -- and more than any other politician -- he embodied New York City in the 20th century. Eighteen months ago, after he supported a Republican in a special election for Congress to express his unhappiness over Obama's position on Israel, the president summoned him to a meeting -- and Koch responded by immediately endorsing the president for re-election after they had met. I first met Koch in 1977 when I was a young political reporter for The New York Times, and I covered him for two years after he went to City Hall in 1978.   A couple of years later, I wrote a negative review of a biography that was critical  of him, and that cemented our friendship.  This led to many meals at Gracie Mansion and at my apartment. When he took office, the city was a violent place, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, and he and New York Gov. Hugh Carey did more than anyone else to revive it.  ""In terms of beating the drums and keeping people awake and having people hope that the city would make it, no one was more important,"" Felix Rohatyn told me. Rohatyn is the investment banker who played a crucial role in fashioning the solutions that brought the city back from the brink.. Koch liked to say, ""I'm just a simple Jewish boy from the Bronx,"" and he never forgot where he came from.   As a teenager Koch worked as a waiter, and the first time he came to dinner at my apartment, he was shocked when he saw how much I was cutting off the strawberries I was serving him for dessert.  ""You're wasting a lot!"" he said. Unlike so many other politicians who never discussed sexual orientation in public, Koch had the longest and strongest pro-gay rights record of any public official of his generation, dating all the way back to 1962, when he first called for the repeal of the New York state law prohibiting sodomy. Almost his first official action as mayor was to sign an executive order banning discrimination against gay employees of New York City, an act that dismayed almost every reporter who was covering him, except me. Tweeters loved Koch's 'New York-iness' When the AIDS crisis struck at the beginning of his second term, he reacted much too slowly, and he told me he regretted that for the rest of his life.  But I never saw any evidence that his failure to act was because he was uncomfortable with homosexuality.  When Larry Kramer founded ACT UP and accused Koch of killing most of his friends, the mayor wanted to meet with him, but he was dissuaded by his staff from doing so.  ""I wish I hadn't listened to my staff,"" Koch told me many years later. Although he had never managed anything larger than a congressman's office when he became mayor, he turned out to be a superb manager.   At the beginning of his administration, he ignored the recommendation of his search committee and picked Robert McGuire, a former federal prosecutor, to be his first police commissioner.  It was an inspired choice, and McGuire did a brilliant job, but first he had to convince Koch he was up to the challenge. ""We had a great interview,"" McGuire recalled.  ""And he called me that night and said, I really want to give you the job, but you've never managed anything."" McGuire replied, ""Ed, you worry about me running the police department.  You're going to be running the city of New York and you don't have a clue of what you're going to be doing!"" ""I never thought of it that way,"" Koch replied, and then he gave McGuire the job. ""We never had a disagreement in six years,"" said McGuire.  ""As a human being he was a great boss. You have to trust a guy, and you have to let them do their job.  Then you have to back them up when they get into deep water, and Ed did all that.  And whenever I told Koch that someone had asked me for a political favor, he said, 'Tell them to forget it!'"" One afternoon, many years after he had left City Hall and long after I was reporting on him, I received a frantic phone call from a family friend.  Her son had been scheduled to drive her to the airport that morning, and he hadn't shown up.  ""I'm sure he's in his apartment, but the police won't break down his door,"" she said. I hung up and called Koch to explain the situation.  He immediately called the office of William Bratton, who was then the police commissioner.  Twenty minutes later, the police broke into the apartment of my friend's son, and discovered he had overdosed on heroine.  He was in a coma for a week, but then he had a full recovery. Koch never asked for any thanks. Most of the time Koch was a natural dealing with the press.  When I was writing a profile of Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau for the Times, I went to City Hall to interview Koch about him, because they had been close political allies for many years. ""People say Morgenthau is a great friend but a terrible enemy,"" I said to the mayor. ""So am I,"" said Koch.  ""And I've given you your kicker!"" -- meaning the last sentence of my story. And so he had.","Charles Kaiser: Ed Koch, who died Friday, hadn't been NYC mayor in years; was still a force .

"Two former guests have sued the proprietors of Los Angeles' Cecil Hotel, where a 21-year-old woman's corpse was found floating in a rooftop water tank. The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court by Steven and Gloria Cott. Deeming it a ""class action,"" the complaint specifies it could apply to ""all persons similarly situated"" -- meaning anyone who stayed at the hotel between February 1 and 19 this year. For as long as 19 days, Elisa Lam's decomposing body was in one of the hotel's four cisterns while the Cotts and other guests below drank cups of water, bathed and brushed their teeth. How did woman's body come to be in L.A. hotel water tank? A maintenance worker, checking on complaints about the hotel's water, found the young Canadian tourist on February 19, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Rudy Lopez said. The lawsuit claims the hotel effectively contracted with its guests to provide water ""fit for human ingestion and human consumption through showering"" -- an obligation that the Cotts allege the hotel did not meet. ""Instead, the defendants provided water that had been contaminated by human remains and was not fit for human ingestion or to use to wash,"" the lawsuit states, claiming the Cotts believe that water was ""tainted."" The Los Angeles Public Health Department immediately tested the water supply, but told the manager they could stay open as long as they provided bottle water and warned guests not to drink the tap water. The results of the testing showed no harmful bacteria in the tank or the pipes, according to Angelo Bellomo, director of environmental health for the department. Chlorine in the city's water may be the reason it is safe, he said last week. The hotel did not immediately respond Thursday to a CNN request for comment. Hotel with corpse in water tank has notorious past . New guests continued to check into the Cecil in the hours after firefighters removed Lam's body from the water tank. But each guest was asked to sign a waiver releasing the hotel from liability if they become ill. ""You do so at your own risk and peril,"" the hotel's release said. Guests who already paid for their rooms would not get refunds if they moved out, it said. In their lawsuits, the Cotts ask for a refund of the $150 total they paid to stay two nights -- checking in February 12 and checking out February 14 -- at the Cecil Hotel. They also are seeking medical costs of approximately $100 and possibly more, if needed; court and attorney fees; and any ""further relief as this court may deem just and proper."" Lam checked into the Cecil Hotel on January 26, on her way to Santa Cruz, California, according to police in her hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia. Five days later, she was seen on a security camera video walking into the elevator, pushing the buttons for four floors and then peering out of the opened elevator door as if she is hiding or looking for someone. Clad in a red hoodie, Lam at one point walks out of the elevator before returning to it, pushing the buttons again. She then stands outside the open elevator doorway, motioning with her hands, before apparently walking away. It was the last day Lam was seen. Authorities still have not officially determined how she died. Los Angeles robbery-homicide detectives are treating this as a suspicious death for obvious reasons, since falling into a covered water tank behind a locked door on top of a roof would be an unusual accident, said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Rudy Lopez. An autopsy has been completed, but the cause of death is deferred pending further examination, assistant chief coroner Ed Winter said last week. That may take six to eight weeks. Any marks, injuries or wounds may suggest Lam died elsewhere and was dumped into the tank by her killer. Water in Lam's lungs could be a sign that she drowned, but it might not tell why she was inside the small tank.","Two former Cecil Hotel guests file a lawsuit against the L.A. hotel .

"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton claimed victory in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, beating out Sen. Barack Obama after a bruising six-week campaign. Sen. Hillary Clinton addresses supporters following her win in Pennsylvania. ""It's a long road to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and it runs right through the heart of Pennsylvania,"" she told supporters in Philadelphia. ""I'm in this race to fight for you ... You know you can count on me to stand up strong for you every single day in the White House."" Clinton commended Obama and his campaign, saying the two are in many ways ""on this journey together.""  Watch Clinton claim victory » . Clinton's big-state victory follows her wins in Ohio, New York, Texas and California. Her campaign said that should raise questions about whether Obama, who leads Clinton in the overall Democratic race, can beat presumptive Republican nominee John McCain in November. ""The tide is turning,"" Clinton told cheering supporters. Chelsea Clinton's eyes welled with tears as she watched her mother speak. With about 99 percent of precincts reporting, Clinton was leading Obama by 10 points.  Watch what Obama's campaign says about the results » . Clinton will pick up a majority of the state's 158 delegates. ""Yesterday, we had record turnout in Pennsylvania,"" she said on CNN's ""American Morning"" Wednesday. ""I won that double-digit victory that everybody on TV said I had to win, and the voters of Pennsylvania clearly made their views known -- that they think I would be the best president and the better candidate to go against Sen. McCain. ""It was inspiring and so exciting because this has been a six-week campaign, one on one. Voters got to look at both of us, consider both of us. I was outspent three to one, and the results were just enormously exciting and gratifying to me."" But the win still leaves Obama ahead in the race to the Democrats' August convention in Denver, and he is likely to hold that lead unless ""the wheels come off his wagon,"" said CNN analyst David Gergen, a former adviser to both Republican and Democratic candidates. ""He came up short, but it doesn't look like the wheels came off,"" Gergen said. ""That's going to be her problem. I don't see her way to the nomination. The wheels aren't coming off the wagon unless there is some new, big revelation."" According to CNN's latest count, Obama leads in the delegate count -- 1,694 to 1,556. He also leads in the popular vote and the number of states won so far this primary season. See how the delegate race has played out so far .

Obama congratulated Clinton on her win and looked ahead to the May 6 contests in North Carolina and Indiana.  Watch Obama congratulate Clinton » . ""There were a lot of folks who didn't think we could make this a race when it started,"" he said in Evansville, Indiana. ""But we worked hard ... And now, six weeks later, we closed the gap. We rallied people of every age and race and background to the cause. And whether they were inspired for the first time or for the first time in a long time, we registered a record number of voters, and it is those new voters who will lead our party to victory in November."" Obama drew more than 90 percent of the vote among Pennsylvania's black voters, who are heavily concentrated around Philadelphia. African-Americans made up about 14 percent of Tuesday's vote. But whites made up about 80 percent -- and voted 60-40 for Clinton. Her supporters turned out heavily in Pittsburgh and the counties of western Pennsylvania, and she was racking up similarly lopsided margins in the state's industrial northeast, the exit polls found. See the exit polls . Obama also scored big with new Democrats in Pennsylvania. One out of every seven Democratic party voters was not registered as a Democrat at the beginning of the year, and 60 percent of them cast their ballot for Obama, according to the exit polls. Clinton fared better with voters who made up their mind in the last week, the exit polls showed. Fifty-eight percent of those voters said they chose the New York senator. That includes voters who made up their mind in the aftermath of last week's heated Democratic debate. Clinton also got the support of older voters, with 61 percent of those age 65 or older backing her, according to the polls. In recent weeks, Clinton fended off calls to drop out of the race as the increasingly bruising primary fight raised worries from within the party that the daily cycle of charge-and-countercharge could hurt the Democrats' chances in the general election. Neither candidate is expected to win the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the nomination by the end of the primary season in June.  Call races for yourself and see how delegates add up » .

"""Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon on Monday, July 21st."" I couldn't have envisaged that 45 years after writing that sentence during an infant school exercise I would still be writing about human exploration of the moon -- or lack of it. Throughout the 1970s, children's magazines showed artists' conceptions of the moon bases that would be built. But following the global excitement of Armstrong's step off the Eagle spacecraft's ladder in July 1969 only 11 more astronauts have walked on the lunar surface and people have not been back since 1972. The moon bases have not materialized and supersonic flights for commercial passengers, that looked like they would become commonplace after test flights during the Apollo era, came and then stopped. In the 1960s it was possible to see 3D movies just as it is today. In 1969 the Beatles were still together -- just about, ""Midnight Cowboy"" won an Oscar for best picture, and Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"" was published. They are all still firm favorites. So have our advances been with such small steps in the intervening years or have we made giant leaps elsewhere? The 1960s might seem familiar but the world was actually very different. There was no World Wide Web, no cell phones -- at least not the kind that fit in your pocket -- crude oil was a fraction of today's price and the Soviet Union still existed. The technology of today would have seemed like science fiction to a child of the 1960s. The Apollo spacecraft that took Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins to the moon was equipped with a navigation computer that is puny in comparison to today's devices. NASA says the Apollo computers had a permanent memory of about 36,000 words and an erasable memory of about 2,000 words. Your smartphone likely has a 32 gigabyte storage facility -- theoretically capable of storing about six billion words and it is a lot more versatile than the hardware on the moon capsules. You can make a video call to a person on the other side of the world, find out your exact position on the Earth to an accuracy of a few meters thanks to satellite navigation, shoot video and share it almost instantaneously, and all from a device that fits in the palm of your hand. Over the last few decades scientists have become more successful in treating cancers, identified individual genes that cause disease and created bionic limbs for disabled patients. So why haven't we been back to the moon? NASA points out that the moon has not been ignored. ""In the 45 years since the Apollo program, NASA has continued scientific study of the moon through robotic explorers,"" said a NASA spokesman. ""Contemporary missions like NASA's GRAIL, LADEE, and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter have helped us explore the upper atmosphere, surface, and interior of our nearest neighbor in the solar system. ""At the same time, NASA's fleet of robotic explorers are extending our senses throughout the solar system, as we seek answers to fundamental questions like 'are we alone? How did life begin on Earth? Can we live on other worlds?'"" he said. Perhaps then, a better question should be: does it really matter that we haven't returned to the moon in person? Major advances . Amazing discoveries have also been made in space since the 1960s. Hundreds of new worlds have been found outside our solar system since the existence of the first exoplanet was confirmed in the 1990s. This year, NASA announced for the first time that an Earth-sized planet that could be habitable had been found 490 light years from us. Astronomers estimate there are tens of billions of similar, possibly habitable planets in our own galaxy. Closer to home, a fleet of NASA rovers has explored the surface of Mars sending back amazing panoramas and drilling into the rocks to test their composition. And it's not just NASA. India's first Mars orbiter is on its way to the Red Planet and private companies are also proposing adventures there. Probes have been sent on a grand tour of the solar system since the Apollo program -- Voyager 1 launched in 1977 is now in interstellar space -- and other spacecraft have studied Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Titan. We may not have a moon base yet but nations have come together since Apollo to build the International Space Station. Covering an area the size of a football field, it has been in continuous occupation since 2000 and carries cameras that give high definition video pictures of our home planet. Our view of the universe has also changed considerably since 1969, partly due to the wealth of images captured by the Hubble space telescope that was launched in 1990. Last year it was announced that Hubble had discovered an exoplanet with a deep blue color and where it possibly rains liquid glass. The European Space Agency (ESA) this year launched the billion pixel Gaia space telescope with the task of building a 3D map of the Milky Way. A successor to Hubble -- the James Webb Space Telescope -- is currently being built and scheduled for launch in 2018. Exciting missions are also under way. The Rosetta spacecraft is due to orbit a comet beginning in August 2014 and then land a probe on its surface as it races around the Sun. Other nations are planning to reach out to the moon, Mars and Jupiter while entrepreneurs are aiming to launch commercial space flights. Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin and SpaceX are all competing to enable access to space. Where next? So is it all over for moon exploration? NASA says not though its focus is on sending astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. ""As international partners and the growing U.S. commercial space industry venture beyond low-Earth orbit as well, there may be some opportunities to return humans and robots to the lunar surface. Our roadmap for exploration includes the possibility of assisting partners with that kind of exploration, but our investments in human spaceflight are focused on enabling the path to Mars,"" a NASA spokesman told CNN. ""We'll soon return humans to the vicinity of the moon ... [a] proving ground we need to test these key capabilities and help us advance on the human path to Mars,"" he said.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- In another summer, when Liz McLaughlin was younger and insulated, she took a long train ride from her native Edinburgh, Scotland, down to London for a very important concert. Excitement bubbled because of the marquee names -- U2, Madonna, Eric Clapton, B.B. King. Famine was not a familiar term to McLaughlin then but Live Aid, organized by Irish musician Bob Geldof to raise money and awareness of hunger in Ethiopia, opened her eyes to human suffering. So much so that a few years later she left her stockbroker job in Chicago to help shuttle aid supplies into war-ravaged Bosnia. Before she knew it, she was driving a truck into Sarajevo. She's been in the aid business now for 18 long years, but McLaughlin was shocked when she visited Kenya and Ethiopia in the last few weeks. Shocked, even after previously seeing the suffering in Sarajevo, Darfur and Haiti. ""I didn't think I'd see any surprises,"" she said at a forum Thursday at CARE's U.S. headquarters in Atlanta. ""I've never seen anything like it in my life."" Her first stop was the Dadaab refugee complex, where CARE has been operating for 20 years. The massive food shortages have swelled Dadaab's population to about 400,000. That's the size of the city of Minneapolis. Desperate, women have walked for 50 miles to reach Dadaab. Some started with three children but arrived with only one still alive. The lines are 15,000-people long just to register for the camp. The United Nations estimates that 600,000 children could die in the next few months in the region. Think about it this way: If famine were declared in the United States, that would translate to 3,000 or more children dying every day from lack of food and water. Impact Your World: How you can help . In an earthquake or tsunami, things are worst in the immediate aftermath. No matter what, aid workers can hope to look forward to things getting better, however measured. But famine is like a creeping monster -- this one first appeared on the horizon many months ago but largely went unnoticed by the world until it began devouring thousands of lives. Burying a child: A mother's unending grief . McLaughlin's colleague Bob Laprade, director of CARE's emergency programs, said that with the rainy season still a few months away, things will get worse before they get better. He showed a map Thursday of the Horn of Africa. The five regions of southern Somalia, where the United Nations has declared famine, appeared in dark brown. Then he showed the projection for the next few months. The dark brown patch grows twice as large. High-res photos: Desperation in Somalia . While Somalia fares the worst largely because of internal conflict and insecurity, Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti and a sliver of South Sudan are also reeling in catastrophe. McLaughlin and Laprade visited areas in Ethiopia that are teetering on famine but are still off the international radar. Not many journalists visit these areas and the world sees little of what is happening there, McLaughlin said. She ran across piles of animal carcasses and bones littering the parched landscape. It has not rained in the Borena region of Ethiopia in nearly a year. ""At first I did not connect the carcasses to starvation,"" she said. But when she arrived at the clinics treating children reduced to skin and ribs, she realized they had no meat to eat. ""This month, it's cattle,"" an elder cattle herder told McLaughlin. ""Next month, it's the people."" At a stabilization center in Haraghe, Laprade watched children curl up in their mothers' arms and look vacantly into their faces. Please save me, they said with their stares. Laprade got back in his jeep, and cried. He, too, in all his 25 years as an aid worker, was struck by the enormity of the crisis. Even for the hardiest aid worker, this was difficult beyond words. Starvation is slow and painful. ""It's really pretty terrible,"" he said. ""These kids will die unless they get immediate assistance."" McLaughlin and Laprade -- who came down with typhoid fever on his plane journey back -- returned to Atlanta with a mission to raise awareness of the famine. They could not let down the people they had met who begged them to tell their tale. There is nothing man can do to avert the worst drought in 60 years. But part of the discussion at CARE Thursday focused on how the international community can help stabilize skyrocketing food prices by looking at agricultural production capacities and trade policies. Food prices fuel hunger in Kenya . In Kenya, for instance, the price of a 90-kilogram bag of maize, which is the main food source for most Kenyans, soared from about $16 in June 2010 to about $44 in July 2011 -- an increase of 160%, according to the Kenya Bureau of Statistics. Laprade and McLaughlin appealed to the world for help in what the United Nations has deemed the worst ongoing humanitarian crisis. McLaughlin said donations for the Horn of Africa total only a fraction of what was collected after the earthquake in Haiti or the tsunami in Japan. Musicians and actors have a lot of pull, she said. Why not another celebrity event to draw the world together? U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke Thursday with U2 frontman Bono on the need to mobilize international resources. The rock star leads Campaign ONE, which fights extreme poverty, and told CNN that people must act to prevent more suffering. ""People seem to prefer watching people on the high streets of London fighting policemen rather than watching children of Somalia fight for their lives,"" Bono said. ""People watch their stock values crumble while I think of our own sense of values tumbling because (the famine) will define who we are."" ""This is outrageous,"" he said. ""This can't be happening. It must be stopped."" Relief groups urge action in East Africa . McLaughlin is hoping the efforts of people like Bono will help bring relief to the 12 million people affected by the acute shortages of food. She recalled how the entire world stopped to watch Live Aid in 1985. The event raised hundreds of millions of dollars for Ethiopia and gave her brand new global insight. ""Why not now? We need that again,"" she said. There are young people in the world's richest nations, she said, who could be touched as she was all those years ago. Maybe, they, too, would then be drawn to act.","Two longtime CARE staffers have just returned from Ethiopia and Kenya .

"(CNN) -- The mayor of crime-ridden Camden, New Jersey, has announced layoffs of nearly half of the city's police force and close to a third of its fire department. One hundred sixty-eight police officers and 67 firefighters were laid off Tuesday, as officials struggle to close a $26.5 million budget gap through a series of belt-tightening measures, Mayor Dana Redd told reporters. The layoffs take effect immediately. Redd said she was unable to secure the $8 million in budget concessions that she says she needed to save the jobs of up to 100 police officers and many of the city's firefighters. The mayor -- who said she will continue negotiations with police and fire unions -- had been asking the workers to pay more for their health care, freeze or reduce their salaries and take furlough days. The apparent impasse has left administrators of a city with the second-highest crime rate in the nation scrambling to figure out solutions to keep residents safe. Camden is second only to St. Louis, Missouri, in annual rankings of cities based on compilations of FBI crime statistics. Some clerical officers were demoted and reassigned to the streets, the mayor said, pledging that the cuts would not affect public safety. ""We're still going to protect our residents,"" said Robert Corrales, spokesman for Redd. Public safety ""will remain our top concern. We'll shift our resources to be more efficient with what we have."" But police and firefighter union officials say the layoffs will most certainly have an impact. ""It's absolutely, physically impossible to cover the same amount of ground in the same amount of time with less people,"" said John Williamson, president of the Fraternal Order of Police union in Camden. ""Response times will be slower."" One local business owner, David Brown, said he does not ""understand how you can do more with less."" ""I don't want to be a pessimist, but I can't be optimistic."" Camden resident and sanitation worker Gloria Valentin said she is now fearful that the city does not have enough police protection to keep people safe. ""Today is a real sad day in the city of Camden,"" she said.","168 police officers and 67 firefighters are laid off in Camden, New Jersey .

Rapper Lil Jon put you all to shame by jumping on a plane so he could turn out to vote in his home district in Atlanta. Lil Jon, who is registered to vote under his real name, Jonathan Smith, emphatically announced Tuesday in an all-caps message on social media that he was on a 6 a.m. flight from Los Angeles to Atlanta. He said Georgia never sent him an absentee ballot after he requested one on Oct. 9, despite ""numerous calls."" In Atlanta, Fulton County Elections Director Richard Barron said the rapper's request for an absentee ballot came in Friday, October 24. The department sent out the absentee ballot via U.S. Postal Service on Monday, October 27, Barron said. He was unable to confirm whether Lil Jon received the absentee ballot, because the department does not track the status of mailed ballots. Luckily for Lil Jon, he had the means to hop on a last-minute flight to his polling station. A few hours later, he posted an image on Instagram of him proudly wearing his ""I'm a Georgia Voter"" sticker. Lil Jon is not the only person with complaints (legitimate or not) about Georgia's voting system. The office of Georgia's secretary of state confirmed Tuesday that its website has been experiencing intermittent problems on Election Day.

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Hong Kong lawmakers resumed debate Wednesday on a bill that may result in the region's first statutory minimum wage. The Minimum Wage Bill is a controversial piece of legislation that lawmakers hope will protect the most vulnerable workers in Hong Kong, one of the few places in the world without any sort of minimum wage law. The debate is set to take two to three days. A recent government survey showed that around half a million workers in Hong Kong earn less than $4 an hour. These include low-skilled workers from the catering, retail, and cleaning industries. According to Man Hon Poon, a policy researcher at the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Union, the lack of legal protection for workers has led to serious exploitation. ""Workers in restaurants have to work for 12 hours or even 14 hours a day to earn a living,"" he said. ""They cannot even go to the cinema."" Legislator Tommy Cheung, however, claims that the government should not interfere with the free market economy, which he says has served Hong Kong well in the past. A minimum wage could deter investors and lead to increased unemployment, said Cheung, who represents the catering industry. ""There is one fear within the industry, that they would have to close down,"" he said. ""When you see a closure, everyone loses out."" The government first proposed the current bill in 2008 following a failed attempt at a voluntary minimum wage. Labor unions, however, have been lobbying for a minimum wage since 1998, following the Asian financial crisis. The rate of the minimum wage has also been under great debate. Trade unions have been demanding a minimum wage of $4 while employer groups have been asking for $3 per hour. If the bill passes this week, the rate of the minimum wage will be set by the Minimum Wage Commission, a consortium of trade union members, employers and scholars, in the coming months. Once the chief executive approves the rate, employers will have six months to implement the law. The Hong Kong government estimates that the earliest the minimum wage law may take effect is May 2011.","Hong Kong lawmakers are debating a new minimum wage .

"Another big challenge facing President Barack Obama and some new twists on key 2014 dynamics and players surfaced during our weekly trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table. 1. POTUS is unwelcome but FLOTUS is in demand . Michelle -- not Barack -- is the Obama who will be racking up some miles in the seven-week sprint to Election Day. Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post reports that the first lady's East Wing staff is pouring through campaign requests and filling her calendar with travel plans. ""Michelle Obama is, in many ways, is the keeper of the Obama flame,"" said Henderson. ""They very much think that she is still someone that can fire up the base: African-Americans, Latinos and women."" FLOTUS stumped for Michelle Nunn this month, with the aim to help generate critical African-American turnout in Georgia. Iowa is also on the schedule. The African-American population there is tiny, but there is a neck-and-neck Senate race, Michelle Obama loves the state, and the thinking is she can try to motivate younger voters who were critical to President Obama's wins but often sit out the midterms. And, there will be more. 2. Speaker Boehner steps up . With the election seven weeks away, House Speaker John Boehner is taking a more aggressive role as a Republican strategist and spokesman. Robert Costa of The Washington Post tells us Boehner is making a mark on domestic and foreign policy. He has an economic speech on the books and took a lead role this past week in shaping GOP reaction to the President's nationally televised address on the ISIS threat. Next week, the speaker will be taking center stage to try to pass a government funding bill and get some kind of legislation passed to push Obama's strategy through Congress. ""I think Boehner has the political capital right now to do both,"" said Costa. ""And with Eric Cantor gone, he's really becoming the face for the Republican Party ahead of the midterm elections."" 3. The GOP's closing argument . The rise of terrorism as an issue is viewed as a potential plus for Republicans in key 2014 battlegrounds. Josh Kraushaar of National Journal highlighted a handful of close Senate races where the GOP thinks the terrorism/security issue is a plus for their candidates. One example is Kentucky, where Sen. Mitch McConnell highlights his role as a congressional leader on national security matters and portrays his opponent as inexperienced. And Kraushaar notes in four other states with close Senate races -- Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa and New Hampshire -- the Republican candidates have military backgrounds. 4. A Democratic loss in Massachusetts may not end up as a GOP gain . New England has not been kind to the Republican Party in congressional races in recent years, but the GOP has several seats on its target list as it looks to expand its House majority. But one of those opportunities became less likely this past week, according to several GOP strategists. Democratic Rep. John Tierney lost his 6th Congressional District primary to Iraq war veteran Seth Moulton. Republicans nominated Richard Tisei, a moderate former state legislator who narrowly lost to Tierney in 2012. That was a presidential cycle, when turnout is higher and Obama was winning big. The GOP hoped a rematch in this more GOP-leaning year might get them a pickup. Now, Moulton is the Democratic candidate. As a newcomer to politics, he can't be tarred as a Washington insider, and his military service is viewed as a plus as terrorism concerns rise as an issue. Tierney is a friend of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, and so his loss didn't sit well with party leaders in Washington. But in the long run it could turn out to be a blessing in an otherwise tough midterm year for the Democrats. 5. Jobs, ISIS and now Ebola for the President's agenda . It's off to Atlanta this week for President Obama, who is scheduled to visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He'll be there ratchet up the White House response to the Ebola crisis in Africa. Julie Pace of The Associated Press reports the President will make the case that helping more is right for humanitarian and national security reasons. ""This is one of those times where we actually have to give the White House a little bit of credit for good management,"" said Pace. ""They want to be prepared and be able to say that even in the middle of everything else that was going on, this is something the President was focusing on.""","Michelle Obama's busy fall travel schedule.

"One of the most common questions a pregnant woman gets asked: ""Is this your first?""—suggesting there were more or will be more. But how many children you choose to have has a fundamental influence on your capacity to juggle the 21st century work-life balance. More kids simply demand more resources: energy, money and time. This is an aspect of family life that doesn't get discussed much. If our increasingly wired lives leave us starved for time and more scattered in our attention, having an only child can be a path to freedom. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, single-child families have almost doubled in number since the 1960s. And yet, our public conversation hasn't caught up to this increasingly common reality. Those who choose to have one child are often confronted with not so subtle snooping on the part of neighbors and friends. Infertility problems? Marriage on the rocks? Too career focused? We simply assume people are having multiple children unless we learn otherwise. In some ways, multiple children are the ""American dream"" story of the work/family debate. Just as the Horatio Alger tale urges us that no matter where we come from, we can work our way up the ladder one rung at a time (ignoring systemic and structural factors), the superwoman tale pretends that there are no limits to a mother's resources (ignoring, well, the realities of the space-time continuum.) There's always more room in the womb and more time in the day; as long as she's got a smartphone and a big heart. But in a new book, ""One and Only: Why Having an Only Child, and Being One, is Better Than You Think,"" journalist Lauren Sandler isn't buying it. She writes, ""One of the central myths of America is that we can engineer a life without tradeoffs."" She counters all the stereotypes of only children—selfish, lonely, maladjusted—with a range of convincing research, explores the environmental arguments for keeping families small, and also looks at the evidence that children from one-child families tend to achieve more and, as a result, can contribute more to society. Just a few examples: Condi Rice, Alicia Keys and Chelsea Clinton are all only children. The important questions center around our assumptions about family, what makes us happy, fulfilled and loved. In other words, how do we recognize our full range of choices as parents? ""Is happiness the result of finding purpose and meaning? Is it the absence of depression?"" Sandler contends that ""it has a lot to do with having the freedom to live the life you want to live, whether that means five kids, or one, or none at all."" It is what we know in our heart of hearts, even when we're fully ensconced in the myth—sucking down a smoothie while driving our kid to school, rescheduling a doctor's appointment, and trying to read the notes for the morning's meeting all at the same miserable moment. It is related to the work-life balance issues that Anne-Marie Slaughter and Sheryl Sandberg touched on. We are human, and as such, we have limits. Whether you scale back your job, scale back your social time, scale back your self-care, scale back your child care assistance, or scale back your family size—something's gotta give. Admitting that isn't just a smart strategy for a saner life. It cuts at the core of one of modern women's most stubborn, self-defeating beliefs -- that unless we are everything to all people, we are nothing, that our worth is tied up in our limitless capacity (at least when it comes to caring for others), that we don't actually deserve to live a selective life and take or leave a number of energy-sucking pursuits. It's not that we have to choose to parent just one child if we want to be sane in contemporary society, but that we owe it to ourselves, our partners and even our potential progeny, to consider other possibilities. Women, in particular, need to slough off socialized norms and think in a fresh, free, way about the kind of life that will really make our families -- and ourselves -- healthy and fulfilled.","Courtney Martin: Women often get asked if they have multiple children or plan to do so .

"The featureless plains of Kazakhstan belie what riches lie buried beneath them. The country has an abundance of natural gas and oil that if developed could more than double the country's crude output in the next decade to 4 million barrels per day, according to the International Energy Agency. That would make it one of the top 7 oil producers in the world. Add a boom in uranium mining to the country's raw materials portfolio and government figures reveal that 70% of its economy comes from its natural resources. Kazakhstan's mineral wealth will be a major source of income for decades to come, but it won't last forever. The country is trying to use it wisely to transition to a broader economic base while developing the natural resources industries to the maximum. Last year Kazakhstan was the world's top producer of uranium, accounting for over a third of global production. The industry's rapid expansion, plus the good quality of the uranium and the comparatively cheap method of mining it have combined to give Kazakhstan an advantage over other big exporters like Australia and Canada. With continued investment, Vladimir Shkolnik, the head of Kazakhstan's national atomic energy company, Kazatomprom, is keen to maintain that position. ""We are hoping to keep our leadership position in the uranium field,"" he says. ""We have dozens of facilities and hundreds of mines and we think we will remain a world leader in the uranium sector."" Kazakhstan's government is also trying to encourage more foreign investment. Since independence in 1991, around $150 billion of foreign investment has flowed into the country; $18 billion dollars last year alone, according to the government. Companies like GE and Eurocopter have been attracted to the country, entering partnerships with national companies that have helped bring training and new skills to the local workforce. While money is flowing from the country's natural resources industry, the government is using some of its revenue to boost other sectors, like IT and engineering. The aim is to make the economy more resilient when commodities prices fall and better prepared for the day when the gush of oil and gas reduce to a trickle. ""Of course revenues from raw materials are still by far the largest share of the country's budget,"" says energy analyst, Murat Karymsakov. ""But in recent years the president (of Kazakhstan) has announced and put into place a plan for industrial and technological development to diversify the economy."" A program that pays for the best and brightest of Kazakhstan's young citizens to study aboard, as long as they return to the country upon graduation, is also helping to create a more knowledgeable, young workforce. Nurzhan Nazarbayev studied in the U.S. but now works at a new hydrocarbon purification plant in western Kazakhstan. He says he feels it is important to play an active role in contributing to the country's development. ""I am proud to work in this sector; to be a benefit to the nation,"" he says. ""With my background, ten years ago I went to a western university to get education and now I am back in my country, to serve my country.""","Oil, gas and uranium account for 70% of Kazakhstan's economy .

"That nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage is encouraging progress for those of us who believe that everyone deserves to have basic civil rights. But, even if every state in the country could pass a similar legislation, it would not be enough. What we need is for our federal government to step up and make this basic right a law of the land. Beyond the social discrimination, the refusal of our federal government to legally recognize same-sex marriages imposes steep financial penalties on same-sex couples. That two of the most costly penalties are triggered upon the death of one partner just adds to the ache of the senseless discrimination. I have been with my partner, Kathy Travis, for 12 years. If I am lucky I will spend the rest of my life living and sharing my joys and happiness with her. We have worked very hard as a team to save for our future together and consider everything we have as equally owned by the other. If the federal government recognized same-sex marriage, then when one of us dies our assets would seamlessly transfer free of tax to the survivor. That's a basic right that every heterosexual married couple has. But because there is no federal recognition of same-sex marriage, if I die first, or vice versa, before either of us can inherit what is now jointly our assets, there would be a federal estate tax bill that one of us would currently have to pay. Again, to be clear: If we were a heterosexual married couple, there would be no estate tax regardless of the size of the estate or who died first. This spring, the Supreme Court will weigh in on the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The Court needs to do the right thing and end discrimination against gay couples. We all have 83-year-old Edith Windsor to thank for in pushing the issue of same-sex marriage equality on to the national front. Edie and her partner Thea were together for 40 years. How many marriages do you know that have lasted that long? But when Thea died in 2009, Edie was hit with a $363,000 federal estate tax bill because as a same-sex couple they were not eligible for the unlimited marital deduction. Are we really a nation that says it is fair and just to demand Edie pay a $363,000 penalty because she is gay? There's another penalty that's even worse. Regardless of the size of their estates, every gay couple is discriminated against when it comes to Social Security benefits. Married heterosexual couples can maximize their Social Security retirement benefits by taking advantage of the highest-earner's benefit. When both spouses are alive, the lower earner can opt to collect a monthly benefit check that is equal to 50% of his or her spouse's benefit. For many married couples, that 50% spousal benefit is often much higher than what the lower-wage-earning spouse could collect based on his or her own earnings record. Most important, when the high earner dies, the surviving spouse is allowed to collect 100% of the deceased's higher benefit. Because same-sex marriages aren't recognized on the federal level, gay and lesbian couples are not eligible for Social Security spousal benefits. The lower earner cannot claim any benefits based on the higher earner's benefit. A heterosexual couple married for just a few months is able to collect a federal benefit that same-sex couples who have been together for decades can't. Are we really a nation that says that is fair? Beyond those two glaring death penalties, health insurance is another area of severe federal financial discrimination against gay couples. I am so glad to see more employers extending health insurance benefits to same-sex partners. But because same-sex couples are not considered legally married under the eyes of the federal government, the dollar value of the health coverage is considered taxable income. A 2007 study estimated that this gay health insurance penalty costs same-sex couples an aggregate $178 million ($1,069 per household), while employers paid an additional $57 million in payroll tax on that taxable income. No heterosexual married couple or their employers pay that penalty. Again, are we really a nation that says that is fair? The social and civil discrimination that persists as long as our federal government does not recognize same-sex marriage is inexcusable. Add in the financial discrimination gay and lesbian couples face and the current policy becomes all the more indefensible.","Suze Orman: It is progress that a handful of states have legalized same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- Ooh, burn! You know that tribute to Woody Allen's lifetime achievement at the Golden Globes on Sunday night? Well, it left out one tiny detail, says his son. ""Missed the Woody Allen tribute,"" Ronan Farrow tweeted, ""did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?"" That's a reference to Allen's adopted daughter, Dylan, who accused the director of molesting her 20 years ago. So, why would Allen's own son allude to the allegation? It's part of the messy, convoluted story that is Woody Allen's personal life. Accusations . Farrow is the child Allen fathered with actress Mia Farrow. (Or is he? More on that later) Mia Farrow also adopted several other children -- Dylan among them. After a 12-year relationship, the couple split after Mia Farrow learned that Allen was having an affair with Soon-Yi, a daughter Mia Farrow adopted before she began dating Allen. (Soon-Yi is now Allen's wife). The same year, Dylan said Allen inappropriately touched her. (A court case was later dropped).

"A Kentucky mother stepped outside of her home just for a few minutes, but it was long enough for her 5-year-old son to accidentally shoot and kill his 2-year-old sister with the .22-caliber rifle he got for his birthday, state officials said.

"A mammoth cargo plane that landed Wednesday night at the wrong airport in Wichita, Kansas -- one that typically does not accommodate such beasts -- took off without incident Thursday afternoon on a runway half a mile shorter than it usually uses. The Boeing 747 Dreamlifter's massive engines roared as it lumbered down the pavement, then lifted off and disappeared into the overcast sky. A few minutes later, it landed without incident at the airport 12 miles across town where it was originally supposed to land -- McConnell Air Force Base. An investigation has begun into what caused the pilot to land at the wrong airport, said Bonnie Rodney, a spokeswoman for Atlas Air, which operates the Boeing-owned jet. It was laden with cargo intended for Boeing, she said. Boeing said the cargo was a B-787 fuselage. Elaborate precautions had been taken to ensure no one got hurt in the take-off attempt. Police closed nearby roads and urged area residents to stay away from the airport. ""Onlookers and gawkers have caused accidents,"" said Roger Xanders, chief of airport police and fire. The takeoff came less than a day after the plane, which was bound for McConnell from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, missed its mark. Instead of landing, as had been planned, at the military airport on Wichita's southeast side, it landed at the much smaller, general aviation Col. James Jabara Airport on the northeast side. Jabara has no control tower and normally doesn't handle jumbo jets. The Atlas Air 747 Dreamlifter is a modified 747-400 passenger airplane that can haul more cargo by volume than any airplane in the world. When fully loaded, the Dreamlifter needs a runway 9,199 feet long to take off, reports affiliate KWCH. The Jabara runway is 6,101 feet. But a spokeswoman for the airport authority, Valerie Wise, cited favorable weather Thursday and the fact that much of the fuel had been used in the flight from JFK -- which lightened the weight of the plane -- for the conclusion that it was safe to take off on the shorter runway.

"For years, the protocol for treating possible concussions on a football field has been this: After a player takes a hard hit to the head, a coach or trainer examines him to assess the severity of the impact and his readiness to return to the field. But a visual inspection only reveals so much. What if there were data that could help detect concussions in real time? Now there are. A wave of new technology, embedded in football helmets, aims to measure the force of on-field collisions and send alerts when a player's health may be in danger. ""We want to protect players as best we can,"" said Thad Ide, head of product development and management at Riddell, the United States' leading maker of football helmets, which has embraced these new head-impact systems. ""It's a way of keeping your players healthy. You can keep your star player healthy, and keep your star player playing more,"" he said. ""That's the way I'd look at it if I was a coach."" Head injuries in football have become a hot-button issue in recent years, from youth leagues to the NFL. Thousands of former pro players -- many with dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other brain disorders -- have sued the NFL, claiming the league knew about the long-term health risks associated with head trauma. Riddell, whose helmets were worn by two-thirds of NFL players last season, was named as a defendant in many of these lawsuits. Meanwhile, more parents are voicing concerns about letting their sons play football amid a study suggesting that high school athletes are more vulnerable to concussions than older players. ""Ten or 15 years ago concussions weren't thought of the same way as they are now,"" Ide said. ""They're being taken much more seriously ... and not just shrugged off as 'being shook up' on the field."" Seeing an opportunity, manufacturers are producing a growing list of products marketed as ""head impact sensors,"" small devices that fit inside the helmet and trigger a warning when a player sustains an especially hard blow.  These products have names like Shockbox, Battle Sports' Impact Indicator and Reebok's CheckLight, and they're pitched as an extra set of eyes on the playing field. Now Riddell is looking to incorporate such sensors into the helmet itself. The company's newest helmet, the SpeedFlex, is the first designed from the ground up to include a polymer-film lining that develops a charge when impact pressure is applied. The helmet's crown contains a flexible panel that compresses upon impact, reducing the force of collisions. Meanwhile, the helmet can be fitted with sensors -- Riddell's InSite system, launched last year -- that send wireless alerts to handheld devices on the sidelines, telling coaches when a player has sustained an unusually forceful hit, or series of hits, to the head. When equipped this way, the helmet is ""an information-gathering tool,"" said Ide, who tests helmets at Riddell's lab in Rosemont, Illinois, outside Chicago. A Riddell spokeswoman said the SpeedFlex helmet will hit the market this summer in time for the 2014 football season. Such impact-sensing technology is not without controversy, however. Tests of head-impact sensors, conducted last year before CNN cameras, have suggested potential problems. Some helmets fitted with the sensors failed to register alerts even after being dropped from five feet or higher, an impact that could easily cause a concussion. Doctors have expressed concerns that inaccurate sensors could give players a false sense of security. ""These technologies can be useful if used cautiously, as long as you don't overinterpret what they mean,"" Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher, director of the Michigan NeuroSport clinic, said last year. ""It could be really dangerous to rely on this too much."" Riddell and other manufacturers are quick to point out that their products don't diagnose concussions or any other injury. They say their devices do give coaches and trainers additional criteria that can help in determining whether a player should come out of a game. Ide believes the SpeedFlex helmet will have additional safety benefits. ""It could help identify players that are striking their head too often. A lot of multiple-impact alerts probably means a player is using their head more than they should, and there's probably an opportunity to coach them not to do that,"" he said. ""And that in the end can protect them better. It can make the game safer.""","""Smart"" football helmet can send alerts when a player sustains a hard hit .

"For about two minutes on Saturday, millions of eyes will focus on Louisville, home of Kentucky's most feted affair, that blissfully short sporting event that comes with its own cocktail. Horses, hats and barrels of booze star in that show, and while the Kentucky Derby experience is not to be missed, Churchill Downs' hometown is worth lingering over. Whether you're headed to the races or thinking about a future visit, enhance your trip with these Louisville experiences: . A touch of art . The 21c Museum Hotel houses 21st-century work by established and emerging artists, as well as 90 guest rooms complete with original art. A huge revitalization success, 21c Louisville was created by transforming downtown tobacco and bourbon warehouses and has been voted among the top hotels in the world by Condé Nast Traveler readers. Get your contemporary art fix for free 24 hours a day in the museum. Video art fans, you'll have to keep slightly more sensible hours. Video installations by artists that have included Bill Viola and Tony Oursler run from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. Visitors to 21c will be greeted outside by Turkish artist Serkan Ozkaya's 30-foot golden replica of Michelangelo's David. A sip of bourbon . Top off the museum experience with a cocktail, or perhaps a bourbon flight, at the adjoining Proof Bar or a meal at Proof on Main, where chef Levon Wallace showcases Ohio River Valley ingredients. The bar stocks more than 50 Kentucky bourbons for your sipping pleasure. You're in the right state for sampling the dark liquor as most of the world's bourbon is produced in Kentucky. The Kentucky Bourbon Trail hits seven distilleries, or just continue along the Urban Bourbon Trail. A bit of sport . Just down the street from 21c, the history of the ""Official Bat of Major League Baseball"" is chronicled at the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory. You can't miss the building. The world's biggest baseball bat, which is 120 feet long, rests against its side. The bat makers, Hillerich & Bradsby Co., have been turning out baseball bats for more than a century, and the facility features exhibits and tours of the plant where bats for today's pros are made. A hefty snack . Louisville's elegant Brown Hotel, built in 1923, is home to the hot brown, a hearty post-revelry snack. The open-faced turkey sandwich, topped with bacon and Mornay sauce was created in the 1920s to satiate hungry dinner dance guests in the wee hours. It still satisfies. A spot of history . Derby attendee or no, you probably don't want to miss one of the city's most popular attractions, the Kentucky Derby Museum at Churchill Downs. It's closed this Friday and Saturday for the weekend's festivities, but general admission is available on Sunday (Note that it's the museum's busiest day of the year). At Churchill Downs, Early Times Kentucky whiskey will provide the kick for nearly 120,000 mint juleps expected to cross race-goers' lips during the Kentucky Oaks and Derby races this weekend. (The Oaks race, held the day before Derby, is more affordable and popular with locals.) A taste of nature . A breath of fresh air is never a bad idea when you're mixing tourism and bourbon. Stroll along the 2.4 mile loop at Cherokee Park, which is part of an extensive system of Louisville parks designed by renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted (of Central Park fame). Another bite or two . Louisville has earned the distinction of being one of the top five ""Foodiest"" small cities in America by Bon Appétit magazine. Restaurant openings are eagerly anticipated, and the city's 2,500 eateries provide plenty of options for every palate. For some of the freshest choices head to NuLu along East Market Street, where trendy new businesses and loft developments are fueling a rebirth. NuLu = ""New Louisville.""  Last year's hot newcomer Decca is still generating buzz with original cocktails, a cellar lounge and local, seasonal fare. One last sip of bourbon . At a real risk of overindulging, make a pilgrimage to The Oakroom at the historic Seelbach Hotel where you can sample the hotel's namesake cocktail, which dates back to 1917. It's a blend of bourbon, triple sec, Angostura bitters, Peychaud's bitters and Champagne. Go home. Detox.","The Kentucky Derby's hometown is worth lingering over .

"It was clear that Dianna Hanson was thrilled to be at the Cat Haven sanctuary. Her Facebook page boasted more pictures of lions and tigers than it did of her friends. Hanson had been at the 100-acre wooded Northern California facility since January -- working as an intern, bonding with the big cats it's home to. On a Facebook photo of her petting a tiger cub, a friend commented, ""You have met your calling."" ""My calling,"" Hanson jokingly responded, ""drools on my pants."" On Wednesday, the 24-year-old Seattle woman was killed when she was mauled by a 5-year-old, 350-pound African lion inside a cage. Hanson's grieving father said the lion, Cous Cous, was one of her favorites. The sanctuary did not release details of why Hanson was in the lion's cage, but said it would investigate whether safety protocols were followed. The Fresno County Sheriff's Office said that when the lion attacked, another employee at the sanctuary tried to distract him away from Hanson into another enclosure. ""But all attempts failed,"" it said. A sheriff's deputy shot and killed the lion to reach Hanson and give her medical assistance. It was too late. ""The victim died at the scene."" Facility 'well run, professional' Hanson's father said he and his daughter took a two-day road trip from Seattle to Dunlap, California, at the beginning of the year when Hanson's internship began. She was supposed to be there for six months. ""Once there, she gave me the tour and showed me all the big cats there with which she would be working,"" the father, Paul, said in a statement Wednesday night. ""Of course, Dianna being Dianna, her favorites were the tiger and the lion ... who killed her today,"" he added. Cous Cous once appeared on Ellen DeGeneres' television show when he was about three months old. The comedian fed him from a bottle as a handler stood by. Late Wednesday, some who knew the lion, who had been raised in captivity, were shocked. Jenny Michaels, the head of The Jungle Jenny Foundation, said she had been in the lion's cage before, accompanied by a park worker . Watch video of the lion from 2012 . ""I didn't see any type of aggressive behavior,"" Michaels told CNN's Piers Morgan. She said the workers at the park were top-notch. ""It was really well run, very professional,"" she said. ""I don't know the circumstances (of the attack) but I can tell you that in my interaction over at Project Survival they have been professional and ... they have run their protocol strictly."" Noted animal expert Jack Hanna said that even if Hanson knew the lion, a big cat can be unpredictable in the way it reacts to what it sees or hears. ""They are wild animals, end of story,"" he said. ""No matter what anyone says, they are wild animals."" Hanna said it would be unusual for someone to enter an adult lion's cage without another person accompanying them or close by. From the archives: White tiger kills zookeeper as tourists watch . Big cat attacks . Twenty people, including five children, have been killed by big cats in the United States in the past 21 years, according to figures kept by Big Cat Rescue, a nonprofit cat sanctuary in Tampa, Florida. Another 246 people were mauled in the United States during that same time period, 1990 to 2011, the group said. The group's website did not have figures for 2012. In California alone, 14 people were mauled, but Hanson's is just the second death. In 2007, an escaped Siberian tiger attacked and killed one person and injured two others in a cafe at the San Francisco Zoo. Leopard killed after mauling six in India . Love of lions started early . Hanson's love for big cats began when she was very young. ""As my mother can tell you, I have had the goals of working with big cats since she adopted a tiger in my name when I was seven,"" Hanson wrote in a 2011 letter. While working at a Washington ski resort while in college, she met a little boy who told her his grandparents owned four tigers. She befriended the family. When she graduated from Western Washington University, her father presented her with a plane ticket to fly to Nukuru, Kenya, with the family and see the work being done with the animals there. ""I will be volunteering at the Cheetah research center, which is run by Project Survival,"" Hanson wrote in a college graduation letter. ""They (also) have a facility in California known as Cathaven. The owners of Cathaven have invited me to see this facility, so I'm hoping to get down there this summer."" In the letter, Hanson thanked her family and friends for helping her get close to her dreams. ""This was her dream come true,"" her father told CNN affiliate KCPQ.

"After a careful review of all relevant research worldwide, the U.S. government's leading analyst of weight data just confirmed what I've long known: Being fat might not be a death sentence. That this study reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association seems at all shocking is a measure of the intensity and pervasiveness of weight prejudice in our society and in our sciences. Another recent study found people who were ""metabolically healthy"" and overweight or obese had no higher death risk than metabolically healthy ""normal"" weight people. I take an interest in the topic because I'm fat and because I don't have a death wish. I'm also interested because, like so many fat people, I've encountered weight discrimination when I seek routine medical care. I was 26 years old when I was denied the right to purchase health insurance. I had no significant history of illness or injury. I was just fat. That day, I became a fat rights activist. Being overweight linked to lower risk of mortality . In the intervening years, I've heard from so many people who fear for their lives when they encounter weight discrimination in our health care system. As a fat activist, I help as much as I can, but I'm no federal agency. One woman called in the middle of the night, hoping I knew of an MRI she could use for an important test. The machine at her local hospital, which she'd used before, was being guarded by a technician who strictly enforced the weight limits. The tray that slides in and out of the machine could break. Instead, she was denied potentially life-saving information in a crisis. How many of the deaths blamed on weight are actually caused by medical equipment -- everything from blood pressure cuffs to surgical instruments -- that fails to accommodate fat people when we need it most? I'll never forget the teenage girl who was told by a nurse practitioner that her complaint would go away once she lost weight. Luckily, she had the nerve and the parental backup to get another appointment and the prescription necessary to treat her condition. How many of the deaths blamed on fat actually happen when people are diagnosed as fat instead of being diagnosed and treated for an illness? Then there are the fat people who did everything their doctors recommended to lose weight ... and died from dangerous diet drugs, from starvation diets, from mutilating weight-loss surgeries. I also hear from many people who live with the devastating physical and psychological consequences of such weight-loss attempts. Some of these stories are referred to as anecdata, meaning they don't count unless they're counted in research -- although there are plenty of studies to support these outcomes. Even so, I believe it still makes a difference when we tell our stories of weight discrimination and its damaging impact on our health. Living: 'Fatshion' bloggers find beauty in all sizes . People are telling their stories of weight bias in medical care on websites like First, Do No Harm, This Is Thin Privilege and Obesity Surgery Gone Wrong. The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance has been speaking out on behalf of fat people's civil rights since its founding in 1969. Health professionals of good conscience are joining this effort in increasing numbers. They've developed an approach called Health At Every Size that is proving to be better for people's health than weight-loss attempts. The Health At Every Size professional organization, Association of Size Diversity and Health, this week launched the project Resolved, a response to New Year's weight-loss resolutions. It invites people to share stories about weight discrimination in health care and opinions about what needs to change. Weight bias has been documented among doctors, nurses, fitness instructors and other professionals on whom a fat person might need to rely for help. Last year, researchers who themselves are part of an anti-""obesity"" institution (Yale's Rudd Institute) surveyed medical professionals who specialize in caring for fat people and found that they had high levels of weight bias, viewing us as ""lazy, stupid, and worthless."" These biases don't improve medical care. Two pioneers of the Health At Every Size approach, psychologist Deb Burgard and health promotion expert Lily O'Hara, analyze existing data to point out that using BMI as a proxy for metabolic health mislabels 51% of healthy people as unhealthy. Meanwhile, 23.5% of the thin people with risky indicators will not be screened or treated early because they ""look"" healthy. In the medical literature, every time fat people prove to be healthier or to live longer than thin people, researchers call that result an ""obesity paradox."" I'd call their refusal to view fat people positively a form of prejudice. Here's a finding from the recent research that didn't make the headlines: For people over 65, being fat wasn't associated with increased risk, not even for the fattest old people. When do most people die, in our increasingly long-lived society? Over age 65, perhaps? Living: Are we really ready to take a look at 'real women'? I also learned this week that a highly accurate way to predict a person's risk of dying is to see how easily they can get up from the floor. I'm trying to imagine how different our health care system would be if, instead of focusing on weight and weight loss, caregivers did the sitting-rising test instead. How much healthier would we be? How much more would we actually enjoy healthy living, free from weight judgment? How much time and money would we save? How much discrimination and human tragedy could we avoid? I'm guessing it'd be tons.","Marilyn Wann: Study confirms fat is not a death sentence, and overweight people live longer .

"Washington (CNN) -- From Race to the Top to ""Waiting for 'Superman,' "" Americans have been talking about public education reform -- and arguing about how to do it. On a sweltering afternoon last week, an estimated 5,000 teachers, parents and students went to Washington to make their case for what to do. Billed as the Save Our Schools March and National Call to Action, the protest was a loosely organized grass-roots coalition of teachers and parents. Their goals: More equitable funding for schools, more social service supports for families, more local control over curriculum and an end to high-stakes standardized tests. Organizers said they came to voice their displeasure with the Obama administration's education reform policies. Teachers give cold shoulder to Obama education chief . After the march, the U.S. Department of Education released a statement: ""Reforming America's education system to prepare students to compete in the global economy is one of our country's greatest challenges. While there are different opinions on how best to do that, we all agree that the status quo isn't working. All of us -- the federal government, principals, teachers, students and parents -- need to get much better, much faster."" Some organizations argue that the Save Our Schools movement is taking the wrong approach. ""S.O.S is about deforming education, not reforming it,"" Jeanne Allen, president of the pro-charter school, pro-school choice nonprofit The Center for Education Reform, said in a press release. ""They put up the guise that this is for the families and students, but in truth, these groups want to restrict and remove any power parents have in their child's education."" So, to better understand the motivations of the marchers, CNN caught up with three participants to find out what brought them to Washington. The teacher turned organizer: Sabrina Stevens Shupe . Sabrina Stevens Shupe, a 25-year-old former teacher from Colorado, remembers the exact moment she first understood algebra, at age 20. ""Despite being a high-achieving student, it was always so abstract to me in school. But years later, there I was, designing a knitting pattern, and suddenly I got it, and it all became relevant to me,"" she said. Stevens Shupe became a teacher three years ago to help students discover what was most relevant to them, and to do so in an active, engaging way. Then she was told to stop teaching that way and focus instead on the skills most essential for state tests. ""And I thought, 'I can't stand by any longer and let this madness continue,'"" she said. Teachers take lessons of No Child Left Behind to D.C. Despite a history of glowing evaluations, her contract was not renewed. She believes it was a retaliatory action for taking a stand against the school's emphasis on narrowed curriculum and test preparation. After blogging and speaking publicly on the issues, Stevens Shupe became one of the march's central organizers last winter. She helped the organization's online presence through blogs, Twitter and Facebook, which helped mobilize people from around the country. ""We were able to forge a coalition out of isolated groups and individuals, and bring people together from every corner of the country in order to demand a different path forward, a permanent seat at the table,"" she said. ""Before the March, many of us felt demoralized and alone. But now, we recognize that we are part of something larger. And I am so proud to be a part of that."" Once a teacher, now a mom and blogger: Rachel Levy . Rachel Levy is a 38-year-old writer and stay-at-home mom of 8-year-old twin boys and a 5-year-old daughter in Central Virginia. She used to be a teacher. Levy's decisions to become a writer -- she maintains three blogs, including one about education -- and take a break from teaching were prompted by the same factors that motivated the march. ""I was wasting far too much of my and my students' time trying to please the testing and data collection gods rather than help children really learn,"" she said. ""But I also realized I had young children and I wasn't yet sure of how to be the teacher or parent I wanted or needed to be."" She said she grew up believing patriotism meant holding politicians accountable, and that drew her to the march. ""To support that, we need a strong and democratic public education system led by well-educated and respected educators who are given enough freedom, time and support to hone their craft,"" she said in an e-mail to CNN. ""And while tests can give us useful information, the sort of fertile learning environment I want for my own children -- and all children -- does not equate quality teaching and learning with simple scores. When people do that, they set the bar way too low for too many of our students."" Why one good teacher decided to quit . After the rally, Levy wondered about what the next steps would be. ""I thought it was a powerful, inspiring event, but I wish I'd seen more people there, especially from nearby states,"" she said. ""I live relatively close to D.C. and close to my state capitol. That means I have an obligation as a citizen to take advantage of my proximity to political power. Why were there not more public education stakeholders from D.C., Maryland and Virginia?"" The teacher and filmmaker: Amy Valens . Amy Valens began her teaching career in 1968. The profession had been on her mind since she was 16 and ran a play group in her apartment complex, she said. Now 64, the Californian recently retired from a teaching job. ""In recent years I've watched the joy and creativity get wrung out of school for students and teachers alike by a progressively narrower school experience predicated on tests, not children,"" she said. ""So I wanted to stand with others who felt as I did, and to say, 'This is not fair to our children or our country.'"" Valens' own version of activism began a few years ago, when she and her husband produced a documentary film, ""August to June,"" about a year in the life of an elementary school. She wrote in a blog entry that she sent the film to U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and received a form-letter response suggesting her school might want to apply for a grant if it had made significant gains. She wrote that she responded, ""If your reference to achieving 'at high levels' means how well our students score on standardized tests, we will not meet your measure. The parents in our programs strenuously object to that approach. ... One visit to our classrooms and it will be clear that we are the exact opposite of a failing school."" ""I've learned over the years what it really takes to ignite the curiosity of a child,"" Valens said. ""We must teach in ways that respect individual students and give meaning to their lives. And we must look poverty in the face and create the means for communities to address it at the same time as we work inside the classroom to give children joyful experiences that meet their natural curiosity and desire to learn."" Valens takes a long view of the march. ""I see this as the first part of a larger movement. I was active in the anti-war movement that eventually mobilized enough Americans to make it politically impossible to continue in Vietnam. So I know how long it can take to rouse people to a cause, especially in economic hard times.""","About 5,000 people joined in the Save Our Schools March .

"After more than seven weeks of heavy fighting, Israel and Hamas have agreed to an open-ended ceasefire. The truce announced Tuesday puts off dealing with core long-term issues on both sides of a bitter conflict that killed around 2,200 people. But Israel agreed to ease the blockade on Gaza, open border crossings for more aid to pass through and extend the fishing limit off the coast to 6 miles, according to a senior Egyptian government official. Both sides agreed to return to Cairo for further Egyptian-mediated talks, the official said. Hamas -- as it has after every battle with Israel -- declared the outcome a victory. But Israel said that Hamas, which holds power inside Gaza, finally accepted an offer that it had repeatedly rejected earlier in the war. ""We hope that this time, the ceasefire will stick,"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said. ""And I think now, as the dust will begin to clear, many people will be asking: Why is it that today Hamas accepted the very same Egyptian framework that it rejected a month ago? ""Ultimately, so much bloodshed could have been avoided,"" he added. Cheers in Gaza . Early in the conflict, Israel openly accepted Egypt's ceasefire proposal and slammed Hamas for not doing so.  Analysts saw Egypt's offers as one of many signs that the fighting was a proxy war for the broader Middle East, with key powers such as Cairo supporting Israel's fight against Hamas. In Gaza, cheers and celebratory gunfire erupted Tuesday. It's ""a day of the victories for our people,"" spokesman Fawhi Barhoum declared before a cheering, screaming crowd.  He praised the ""steadfastness and resistance"" in Gaza. ""The occupiers have tried to break them ... but the delegation spoke with one voice,"" Barhoum said of the negotiations. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who is not part of Hamas and lives in the West Bank, thanked ""Egypt and everyone who supported all the efforts that resulted in this agreement to end the aggression."" ""Together, we will rebuild our free country,"" he added. Abbas is with the Palestinian faction Fatah, which runs the government in the West Bank and is a longtime rival of Hamas.  The two factions have fought in the past but also made attempts at unity governments, including one this year. 'Tackle the root causes' Tuesday's truce didn't deal with Israel's main demand for the demilitarization of Gaza. It also didn't address Hamas' calls for the rebuilding and reopening of Gaza's airport and the establishment of a seaport, as well as the release of prisoners held by Israel. Palestinians say Israel and Egypt's blockade of Gaza suffocates the economy of the small, impoverished territory. But Israel says Hamas can't be trusted to not import weapons. ""Any peace effort that does not tackle the root causes of the crisis will do little more than set the stage for the next cycle of violence,"" a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Tuesday of the ceasefire. ""After 50 days of profound human suffering and devastating physical destruction, any violations of the ceasefire would be utterly irresponsible,"" he said. More than 2,130 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict. It's not clear how many were civilians. The United Nations estimates that more than 70% were civilians, but Israel reports a higher number of militants among the dead. Sixty-seven Israelis -- 64 of them soldiers -- have been killed, the United Nations reports.  A foreign worker in Israel was killed as well. 'Eyes wide open' The truce appeared similar to a previous agreement reached after a short conflict in November 2012. ""In the end, Israel had two alternatives: either to occupy Gaza and destroy Hamas or to go to a ceasefire,"" a senior Israeli official said on condition of anonymity. ""Once we decided not to occupy Gaza, we pushed for the same conditions that led to the end of hostilities in 2012."" He said that he was ""not confident"" the ceasefire would last, but that if Hamas wants it to hold, it will. Israel has said its military actions destroyed dozens of tunnels beneath Gaza, some of which extended under the border and were used by Palestinian militants to launch attacks. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry welcomed news of the ceasefire Tuesday and called on all parties to comply with its terms. ""We are approaching the next phase with our eyes wide open,"" Kerry said in a statement. ""We have been down this road before, and we are all aware of the challenges ahead. Both the Israelis and the Palestinians have strong views about their needs and the future of the region.""

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu exhorted the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday to draw ""a clear red line"" to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In a theatrical gesture, Netanyahu held up a cartoon-like drawing of a spherical bomb and drew a red line below the fuse, ""before Iran completes the second stage of nuclear enrichment to make a bomb,"" he said. ""It's not a question of whether Iran will get the bomb. The question is at what stage can we stop Iran from getting the bomb,"" said Netanyahu, who also accused Iran of aggression. ""I ask, given this record of Iranian aggression without nuclear weapons, just imagine Iranian aggression with nuclear weapons,"" the Israeli prime minister said. ""Who among you would feel safe in the Middle East? Who would be safe in Europe? Who would be safe in America? Who would be safe anywhere?"" Do U.S., Israel have the same 'red line'? But Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Eshagh al-Habib, called Netanyahu's remarks ""entirely baseless."" ""I do not dignify it with an answer other than categorically rejecting it, in particular regarding the nuclear program of my country which is exclusively peaceful and in full conformity with our international obligations and in exercising our inalienable right to use nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes,"" he said in a statement. He went on to say that Israel is a nation ""based on terrorism."" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told CNN that his country won't be influenced by a threat from Israel and a demand from U.S. President Barack Obama to abandon plans to acquire nuclear weapons. ""When we say we do not take it seriously, we mean that it impacts -- it does not impact our policies in the slightest,"" Ahmadinejad told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in an interview to be aired Sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. Eastern. Iran's president talks Israel, slams homosexuality . The White House highlighted how Obama sided with Israel in his speech before the General Assembly this week. ""As the prime minister said, the United States and Israel share the goal of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,"" National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with Netanyahu for more than an hour later Thursday, a senior State Department official said. Clinton and Netanyahu talked at length about Iran and agreed to continue ""close consultation and cooperation toward achieving"" the goal of stopping Iran from getting atomic weapons, the official said.

Abbas said Palestinians will continue to seek full membership status in the United Nations, but they have begun ""intensive consultations"" with member states about having the Palestinian Authority become a nonmember state, one step up from its current status as a permanent observer. ""We are confident that the vast majority of the countries of the world support our endeavor aimed at salvaging the chances for a just peace,"" Abbas said. ""In our endeavor, we do not seek to delegitimize an existing state -- that is Israel -- but rather to assert the state that must be realized -- that is Palestine."" Then, departing from his prepared speech, Abbas added, to applause: ""We are not attempting to delegitimize them, they are trying to delegitimize us."" Speaking later, Netanyahu criticized Abbas' remarks. ""We won't solve our conflict with libelous speeches at the U.N. That's not the way to solve them. We won't solve our differences with a unilateral declaration of statehood,"" Israel's leader said.  ""We have to sit together and negotiate together in which a demilitarized Palestinian state recognizes the one and only Jewish state."" Last year, the Palestinian Authority failed in its bid to win U.N. recognition as an independent state. In their latest initiative to seek non-member observer status, the Palestinians are likely to submit a new resolution after the  November 6 U.S. presidential election in an effort to prevent the issue from becoming political fodder.  Palestinian officials have expressed concern about pessimistic comments by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney about the chances for peace in the region. In his speech Thursday, Abbas criticized Israel and said Palestinians were facing ""a campaign of ethnic cleansing"" in which they are being denied full access to houses of worship, schools, hospitals and housing. ""The occupying power is also continuing its construction and expansion of settlements in different areas throughout the West Bank,"" he told the assembly. Israel rejects a Palestinian state and refuses to end its occupation, Abbas said. ""I speak on behalf of an angry people,"" he said. ""Israel continues to enjoy impunity."" Ahmadinejad tells U.N. that Iran is threatened . For Israel, the issue of how to respond to Iran's nuclear program has put a strain on relations between Netanyahu and Obama. Tehran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but Western leaders say they believe it is aimed at building a weapon. Netanyahu has been pushing the United States to establish a clear ""red line"" that Iran cannot cross if it wants to avoid war. Israel seeks international urgency, as negotiations aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions have failed to produce an agreement and the effectiveness of sanctions on Tehran remains unclear. Assange speaks via satellite . Later Thursday, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi raised another contentious international issue during his speech to the assembly -- that of the heated territorial dispute between China and Japan over a set of islands in the East China Sea. Yang accused Japan, a key U.S. ally, of stealing the remote islands from China in the past and warned that Beijing would be ""firm"" in upholding its territorial sovereignty. The Japanese government's announcement this month of the acquisition of several of the disputed islands from a Japanese family has heightened tensions between the two countries. Violent anti-Japanese protests have taken place in Chinese cities, and economic ties between Asia's two largest economies have started to sour. Meanwhile, patrol vessels from the two countries have been frequently locked in tense standoffs in the waters around the islands after China sent a flotilla of ships to the area. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda of Japan referred indirectly to the situation in his speech to the assembly Wednesday. Noda emphasized Tokyo's commitment to using international law to resolve territorial disputes and called for greater adherence to the ""rule of law"" by other nations.

"Model Paulina Gretzky isn't a pro golfer but she's made it onto the cover of the latest issue of Golf Digest. The controversial move has left some women in the sport frustrated as the magazine defends its position. Golf Digest, which bills itself as ""the authority on how to play, what to play and where to play,"" has explained that as the fiancée of PGA Tour pro Dustin Johnson, Gretzky is a major celebrity in the golf world and thereby qualifies the recognition of a cover story. ""Sports figures, celebrities and models have appeared on Golf Digest covers since the magazine's beginning,"" the publication's editor in chief, Jerry Tarde, says in a statement. ""Paulina ranks at the high end of the golf celebrity scene today, and she has a compelling story to tell. She also might get some new people interested in the game."" But to some members of the Ladies Professional Golf Association, choosing Gretzky -- who, yes, is the daughter of hockey great Wayne Gretzky -- means a female pro golfer is getting overlooked. ""It's the state of where we've always been. We don't get the respect for being the golfers we are,"" Stacy Lewis, a top-ranked American golfer, has told press, according to USA Today. ""Obviously, Golf Digest is trying to sell magazines, but at the same time you like to see a little respect for the women's game."" In the Golf Digest piece, Gretzky discusses her involvement in the sport and demonstrates six golf-improvement exercises. On the cover and in two of the photos used to promote the issue, which is available via tablet starting April 8 and from newsstands starting April 15, she doesn't wear the typical golf attire but rather fitted workout pants and a sports bra. Golf Digest appears to have anticipated the reaction to the cover, as it already has an answer to the question, ""What's Paulina Gretzky doing on the cover of Golf Digest?"" up on its website. The response falls in line with what editor Tarde says in his statement: given the fact that Gretzky is ""as much a subject of fascination at tournaments as the guy she's there watching,"" combined with the fact that ""she's an attractive, fit woman who -- like many of our prospective readers -- is fairly new to golf ... she seemed a natural cover subject for our second annual issue devoted to fitness."" That position seems to answer the query veteran golfer Angela Stanford has asked: Who, exactly, is Golf Digest trying to sell to? ""If the answer is men 25 years old through 45 years old, then I guess that's what they have to do,"" she told USA Today. ""You know the old saying, sex sells. And nobody can argue with that. It's just the way it is. But the LPGA has some attractive women and very fit women, so why not use them? I'm just baffled by it.""","Golf Digest's new issue featuring Paulina Gretzky has sparked questions .

"The Obama administration is thinking about sending additional military advisers to Iraq as it ramps up efforts to consider how to get thousands of Yazidi Iraqis off Sinjar Mountain and how to boost the capabilities of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in northern Iraq, a U.S. official said Tuesday. The official did not want to be named because no decisions have been made yet. But consideration is being given to sending as many as 75 additional American military personnel to Iraq, a second U.S. military official told CNN. President Barack Obama had previously authorized sending as many as 300 advisers to that country. Currently, 250 U.S. military personnel are in Iraq and are directly involved in the already-approved mission of running two joint operations centers and assessing the capabilities of Iraqi forces. However, the first U.S. official said, their job is expanding to consider evacuation options and the needs of the Peshmerga. With a new mission, it is expected the White House could make a new War Powers notification to Congress to send additional personnel outside the 300-person limit for the new short duration task of assessing the Peshmerga and developing options for evacuations. Obama said the United States is looking for ways the international community can band together to rescue those who have been stranded by the fighting. ""The next step, which is going to be complicated logistically, is how do we give safe passage for people down from the mountain, and where can we ultimately relocate them so that they are safe. That's the kind of coordination that we need to do internationally,"" Obama said on Saturday. Pentagon officials said one of the first steps is getting a clearer picture of how many people are still stranded, so planning for evacuation options can begin. ""We're currently assessing what we can and can't do and trying to understand, for example, the numbers that are on the mountain itself. The numbers vary. I've seen reports of numbers in the thousands, and I've seen reports in the numbers of tens of thousands,"" Lt. Gen. William Mayville, director of operations on the Pentagon Joint Staff, told reporters Monday. One U.S. defense official said that while some people have escaped through humanitarian corridors, the United States  believes anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000 people potentially could still be on the mountain, although the actual number is not known. With those numbers, any operation, whether by air or land, could take weeks. All of the officials CNN has spoken to say the administration has ruled out putting U.S. troops on the ground, but some rescue options -- for example, using helicopters -- could involve a brief U.S. ground presence. U.S. officials do believe that any rescue option, such as Peshmerga forces going in, or the establishment of additional safe passage corridors on the ground, still require a heavy U.S. air combat presence to suppress ISIS militants from attacking. On Monday, U.S. fighter jets attacked several ISIS positions near Mount Sinjar, including checkpoints, which is part of the effort to begin to push them back, the U.S. official said. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have requested additional arms supplies from the United States, the first U.S. official noted. If additional U.S. advisers are sent, part of the their expanded role will be to assess the capabilities of the Peshmerga and see what else is needed beyond the resupply of ammunition. Mayville hinted at this Monday as well, telling reporters that some of the militant forces have longer-range weapons systems ""so we need to make sure that the government of Iraq and the Iraqi security forces are providing longer-range weapons themselves to the Kurdish forces.""","The United States may send more military advisers to Iraq .
The U.S. advisers already there will consider evacuation options .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- After a decade in power, India's ruling Congress Party conceded Friday that it is headed to defeat as vote counting in the world's largest election was under way. The mammoth election appears likely to unseat Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's two terms of leadership after a rash of high-profile corruption scandals, stubborn inflation and a slowed economy. Party spokesman Randeep Surjewala told CNN, ""Trends indicate a victory for the opposition alliance. ""We bow before the wishes of the people of India with all humility. We will continue to play the role assigned to us. We will try with greater vigor and determination to work with the large populace of this country."" The Indian National Congress Party has dominated Indian politics since the nation's independence in 1947. Seen as the father of India's economic reforms, the 81-year-old, Oxford-educated Singh has been Prime Minister for India's governing coalition since May 2004. On Tuesday, he bade farewell to his staff, just three days ahead of the vote count. He will tender his resignation to the nation's President on Saturday, said his spokesman Pankaj Pachauri. The official Prime Minster Twitter account stated that Singh had called Modi to congratulate him on his ""party's victory."" Congress Party Vice President Rahul Gandhi said, ""I hold myself responsible"" for the defeat. Exit polls, released after the five-week general election, have portended a majority for the opposition alliance led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has fielded a pro-business leader, Narendra Modi, as its candidate for the Prime Minister's post. India's stock market surged Friday after initial numbers suggested a huge lead for the party. Celebrations broke out with singing, dancing, bands and even elephants in the mix as initial Election Commission numbers indicated a huge lead for the BJP. Supporters celebrated in the streets in Gujarat, the state where Modi has served as chief minister since 2001. He tweeted: ""Good days are here to come."" A jubilant BJP described its potential landslide as a turning point for Asia's third-largest economy. ""Till some time ago, it was said India's success story is over. Now, the time has come to rewrite India's success story,"" party chief Rajnath Singh told reporters. He stressed the BJP had campaigned on the planks of development and good governance and credited Modi's leadership skills for its success. Some observers say India's 2014 voting was akin to a referendum. ""The majority of Indian voters had to choose between Modi or no Modi. They chose Modi. It was a referendum,"" said K.G. Suresh, a political commentator in New Delhi. The South Asian democracy, the world's largest, recorded a provisional turnout of 66.4% of its 814 million eligible voters in its nine-step elections that began on April 7, said India's election commission spokesman Rajesh Malhotra. The count from electronic voting machines began 8 a.m. local time Friday. As is the norm, the Indian President will invite the party or the alliance with the largest number of elected lawmakers to stake claim to government formation. In 2009, the Congress party, headed by Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, won 206 of 543 boroughs, its best performance in almost two decades that mostly saw coalition governments running the country. Within a couple of years since assuming power for a second term, Singh's administration has had its popularity plummet over a spate of corruption allegations that sparked widespread street protests by anti-graft activists. High prices, slowing growth and what observers call policy paralysis dented Singh's image as a reformist. ""The Underachiever -- India needs a reboot,"" wrote the U.S.-based Time magazine in its Asia edition in 2012 that featured Singh on its cover. ""Is Prime Minister Manmohan Singh up to the job?' the title asked. ""I have every reason to believe when history is written of the period, we will come out unscathed,"" Singh told a news conference in January as he announced he would not run for another term after the general elections. He, however, defended his governance. ""This is not to say there were no irregularities. There were irregularities, but the dimensions of the problems have been overstated by the media, by the CAG (comptroller and auditor general), sometimes by other entities,"" he had said. According to a damning report by the CAG, India's national auditor, the national treasury lost as much as $31 billion from the 2008 sale of the wireless frequencies. The scandal rocked Singh's government during its second term, as it also struggled with accusations of large-scale fraud in the sports, real estate and coal sectors. ""We are deeply committed to the objective of combating corruption,"" Singh told reporters. ""An array of historical legislation has been enacted to make the work of the government transparent and accountable.""

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China has blocked the popular video-sharing Web site YouTube but did not offer a reason for the ban. YouTube was blocked in China as of Wednesday. Google, which owns YouTube, said it began noticing a decline in traffic from China about noon Monday. By early Wednesday, site users insider China continued to encounter an error message: ""Network Timeout. The server at youtube.com is taking too long to respond."" ""We do not know the reason for the blockage and we are working as quickly as possible to restore access to our users,"" said Scott Rubin, a spokesman for Google, which owns YouTube. It's not the first time users in China have been unable to access the site. In March 2008, China blocked YouTube during riots in Tibet.  Watch more about the decision » . At the time, protesters burned vehicles and shops, some advocating independence from China, and others demonstrating against the growing influence of the Han Chinese in the area. The subsequent crackdown left 18 civilians and one police officer dead, according to the Chinese government. Tibet's self-proclaimed government-in-exile put the death toll from the protests at 140. Many in the country speculated the latest ban may be an attempt to filter access to footage that a Tibetan exile group released. The videos show Tibetans being kicked and beaten, allegedly by Chinese police officers after the riots. ""Though there is much footage of the protests taking place throughout Tibet last year that were splashed across the world, the following is rare footage of police beating of protesters, the suffering and death of a captive, and paramilitary presence in Lhasa (the Tibetan capital), which managed to make its way to the outside world,"" the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India, said of the videos. Xinhua, China's state news agency, accused the supporters of Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, of doctoring the video to ""deceive the international community."" China, with 298 million Internet users, has routinely blocked access to Web sites it considers politically unacceptable, including the Voice of America and The New York Times. The Chinese government has also censored television broadcasts, including those by the BBC and CNN, during coverage of issues such as its policy in Tibet and Taiwan. The Chinese government did not directly address whether it has blocked YouTube. ""China is not afraid of the Internet,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang on Tuesday. ""We manage the Internet according to law ... to prevent the spread of harmful information."" YouTube, which allows users to upload and share videos, has been banned periodically in other countries as well. Bangladesh, Pakistan, Thailand and Turkey temporarily shut off access to the site after users uploaded content the countries' governments considered politically embarrassing.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Prince Saud al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's minister of foreign affairs, said Wednesday that his country had abandoned mediation talks to resolve Lebanon's political crisis that caused the government's collapse last week. Al-Faisal made the comments in an interview with state-run Saudi TV in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt where he was attending an Arab economic summit to discuss economic challenges facing Arab nations. He also described the political situation in Lebanon as ""dangerous."" Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah and Syrian President Bashar Assad have been personally involved in an attempt to resolve Lebanon's political crisis, the Saudi foreign minister said. But when no agreement was near the Saudi king ""lifted his hands and kept away from the negotiations,"" al-Faisal said. Meanwhile, Qatari and Turkish foreign ministers arrived in Lebanon Tuesday in an apparent attempt to pick up where Saudi and Syrian efforts left off. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al Thani met with President Michel Suleiman, and caretaker Prime Minister Saad Hariri among other leading political figures, state-run Lebanese news agency (NNA) reported Tuesday. Following the announcement of the government's collapse last Thursday when Hariri was in Washington for a planned meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama, Hariri stopped on the way back to Beirut in Ankara for consultations with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Local media reported on Tuesday that a gathering of ''hundreds of unarmed men'' from the two Shia parties, Amal and Hezbollah, had marched on downtown Beirut. Tension has risen in the capital since Monday, when the prosecutor in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri submitted his long-awaited results of the case. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon in the Netherlands has been investigating the February 2005 car bombing that killed Rafik Hariri, the father of Saad Hariri. In a statement released Monday, President Barack Obama appealed to all Lebanese factions to maintain calm and avoid violence. ""Any attempt to fuel tensions and instability, in Lebanon or in the region, will only undermine the very freedom and aspirations that the Lebanese people seek and that so many nations support,"" Obama said in the statement. In his interview on Wednesday, the Saudi foreign minister echoed a similar appeal and added, that ""if matters come to separation and partition of Lebanon, then Lebanon will end as a state containing this type of peaceful coexistence between religions, nationalities, and different strata and this will be a loss for the entire Arab nation.""

"Just one decade after the European single currency was launched amid fanfare and fireworks, its future looks uncertain as the debt crisis that engulfed Greece, Ireland and Portugal threatens the entire bloc -- and the wider global economy. Spain, the bloc's fourth-largest economy, is the latest country to be swept into the crisis. In June, it was forced to seek up to €100 billion in aid from its eurozone peers  to shore up its banking sector. Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy said the deal had demonstrated the advantages of cooperation within the bloc and meant ""European credibility won, the future of the euro won [and] Europe won."" Why ratings agencies take center stage in crisis . But the markets have remained skeptical, pushing up the costs of Spain's borrowings despite the bailout. Italian borrowing costs have also gone up as investors fret the problems will spread. Greece, meanwhile, faces its second election on June 17 and risks being ejected from the bloc. Many analysts saw it all coming of course, arguing that one fiscal system could never work for 17 EU countries that adopted the euro, serving more than 330 million people. The flaws were exacerbated after some countries were suspected of fudging their numbers, including Greece which in 2004 admitted it gave misleading information to gain admission to the eurozone. The crisis exploded after Greece revised its figures to show its 2009 budget deficit would be 12.7% of gross domestic product -- far higher than the eurozone limit of 3%. The bloc -- whose financial fractures may not have been apparent during the boom years -- then began to unravel. After Greece's dire numbers were revealed, investors panicked and the country was unable to raise money to fund itself. The country was forced to take a €110 billion bailout from its eurozone peers and the International Monetary Fund. But Greece's bailout, rather than stemming the panic, served as a harbinger to the debt crisis. Eurozone debt crisis glossary . The European Financial Stability Facility, or European bailout fund -- set up to deal with further financial stumbles -- was quickly tapped again. Ireland, felled by a black hole in its banking system, was forced to take a €67.5 billion bailout package in November 2010. After the markets then closed their doors to Portugal, it was also forced to take a €78 billion bailout. The troubled nations implemented austerity measures to try to rein in their hefty piles of debt, but confidence in the bloc's ability to stabilize itself continued to fall. The crisis may yet engulf Italy, which makes up 17% of the eurozone economy. Greece, Ireland and Portugal make up less than 6% between them. And so Europe's politicians and officials have desperately tried to sort out the mess by coming up with ideas including boosting the bailout fund, bringing the disparate economies closer financially, and tapping other markets for funds. Their previous measures proved ineffective, as the markets -- and the world -- remained unconvinced at the bloc's ability to survive in its existing form.","Debt crisis that's engulfed Greece, Ireland, Portugal still a threat to entire eurozone .

"Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, knows something about secrets and what happens when they're exposed. He has some advice for Edward Snowden, who recently leaked information about the extent of U.S. electronic surveillance programs. ""I would strongly advise him to go to Latin America,"" Assange told CNN's AC360 Monday night. ""Latin America has shown in the past 10 years that it is really pushing forward in human rights. There's a long tradition of asylum."" Assange spoke from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been holed up for almost a year. Ecuador's government granted him asylum in August, but British authorities have said they will arrest him if he leaves the premises. Assange had kind words for Snowden, whom he described as heroic, and harsh words for the programs he helped to expose. Snowden, 29, told the British newspaper the Guardian that he left behind his family and a six-figure job in Hawaii to reveal the extent of the NSA's collection of telephone and Internet data, which he called ""an existential threat to democracy."" NSA leaker ignites global debate: Hero or traitor? He worked for computer consultant Booz Allen Hamilton, a contractor for the U.S. electronic intelligence agency. Snowden took off for Hong Kong before the stories were published and had been holed up in a hotel there, the Guardian reported. He checked out of his hotel Monday but remains in the semiautonomous Chinese territory, said Ewen MacAskill, the Guardian's Washington bureau chief. ""The oversight of this process is done in secret. The policy is secret,"" Assange said. ""It's not a case of looking at a particular suspect and deciding to apply surveillance to them as we once did in the past, but rather, just bulk, arbitrary, driftnet fishing across, not just Americans, but essentially the whole of the human race."" In some cases, where there is sufficient evidence, it is right to watch some people for some amount of time, Assange said. Chinese Internet users back Snowden . But, he argued, there is no justification for keeping such programs a secret. ""No one accepted and gave (U.S. President Barack) Obama the mandate to engage in a worldwide surveillance program on nearly every person."" Assange fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. He has said he fears Sweden will transfer him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty for the work of WikiLeaks if he were charged and convicted of a crime. He has repeatedly said the allegations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website, which facilitates the publication of secret documents. Assange has not been charged in the United States, though Assange and his supporters say a U.S. grand jury has been empanelled to consider charges against him.

"Ladies donning their best black dresses, cowboy boots and pearls stand alongside men wearing khakis with tucked-in button-ups and blazers. Anticipation is in the air and the fervor is growing. This isn't a fancy event or church service. These fashionable fans are ready to kick off another college football Saturday in the South. When the University of Alabama and the University of Missouri go head-to-head on Saturday in the Southeastern Conference championship, college fans will no doubt be dressed in their Sunday best. Whether you are a Georgia Bulldog, a Florida Gator or you're yelling ""Roll Tide"" after 'Bama scores a touchdown, a Saturday in the SEC normally means you're in front of a television arguing over commentary or you're in a stadium, cheering with your friends. And there's no way you're wearing jeans and a team shirt. We can't talk about the importance of fashion in the SEC and not talk about what football means to the South. It's the game of football you hear a father explain to his son on a cool, autumn morning. And it's football that has families gathered around the television screaming over each field goal and fumble. Bleacher Report editor Chris Cornell says college football is a national phenomenon, but it's like a religion down here. In the South, the added appeal of college football comes from the lack of promising professional teams. ""Look at Florida. A team like the Dolphins doesn't really get much publicity. Atlanta has the Falcons but they aren't really winning enough to keep interest, right?"" he said. It's the college fandom that reaches bigger heights -- heights that come in the forms of boots, pumps and fashionable football attire. ""We love our teams and want to support them to the best of our abilities. It's not just about the clothes we wear, but the attitude that we carry as well,"" said Lydia Buckner, a senior at Mississippi State University, where she said game-day prep is a group affair. Buckner and her girlfriends get together to do their hair and makeup, and while the girls are in the bathroom, the guys are watching other college games and cooking out. ""Coming together like that gets the spirit up and builds on all the excitement,"" she said. In the South, you dress up for whatever you take pride in. And that could be anything from family dinners to a visit to grandma's. Add a crowd and there's all the more reason to look your best. ""With over 100,000 people around, you never know who you'll run into, or if you'll end up on TV,"" said Hayley Taylor, a style blogger and recent Louisiana State University graduate. ""I wouldn't want to run into a friend looking my worst."" Game-day style has given rise to niche boutiques such as Sideline Sweetie, an online store that's been selling trendy tailgate attire for women since 2011. Owner Rosanne Nettles says the idea came from realizing there weren't enough places to find cute outfits in school colors that a woman could wear to a game. At the time, she owned three women's boutique and formal wear stores in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Women were tired of jeans and jerseys. They wanted dresses, maxi skirts, and prints galore. Trendy, not masculine. ""Every social event is a big deal in the South. People love to dress up and we love football,"" Nettles said. ""We realized that we could not keep in stock red and black, as customers were calling from all over for Georgia and Alabama game-day apparel. As we started to introduce more navy, we noticed that Auburn fans started calling also."" To keep up with demand, Nettles gave the store's ""Sideline Sweetie"" game-day collection its own brand and website. The site is busiest from July to November, with Alabama, Georgia, Auburn and Florida fans among her best customers. ""The Northern and Midwest schools are definitely our least popular,"" she said. When it comes to dressing up for football, there are some crucial dos and don'ts. Talk to many female college fans and they'll give you the same advice: Keep it classy. You're representing the entire university when you step out to tailgate. Always dress in school colors, use accessories to dress up any outfit, and above all, be smart about your footwear, Buckner says. ""If you can't walk a block comfortably, you're going to regret it -- senior to freshman advice,"" Buckner said. ""Trust me, I know those heels look supercute but your blistered feet will definitely not. You want to be able to cheer and jump without constantly worrying about a wardrobe malfunction."" We want to hear from more sharp-dressing college football fans. What is your go-to outfit on game day? Send us a photo of yourself in your best tailgating attire. After all, this is what college football is really about.","When tailgating in the South, a team T-shirt simply will not do .

"UPDATE: On April 30, NASA revealed ""Technology"" as the winning design for their new Z-2 spacesuit. With almost 150,000 votes -- just over 63% of the 233,431 total -- ""Technology"" will be incorporated into the final version of the Z-2 spacesuit, and is expected to be ready for testing by November. I applaud you all for not choosing ""Biomimicry."" There's hope for the future. Maybe. Below is our original column about the design contest, published on March 28: . The July 21, 1969, headline of the New York Times read, ""MEN WALK ON MOON."" But had Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin not been wearing their fancy A7L spacesuits when they stepped off the Eagle, readers would probably have woken up to ""WELL, THAT GOT MESSY."" To be fair, I don't actually know what happens if an astronaut ventures out into space wearing, say, blue jeans and a Mexican Baja hoodie, but if cartoons have taught me anything -- and God knows they have -- it's that people tend to explode. So that's exactly what would happen. Cartoons don't lie. Of course, the Apollo 11's original A7L spacesuit was a technological achievement for its time. But like all things NASA, it was a constant work in progress, and four missions later when Apollo 15 blasted off for (I think) Pittsburgh, astronauts began wearing the A7LB. See what they did there? They added a B. Most notably, among some other minor changes, the A7LB provided more waist mobility for sitting in the rovers. But it was also probably just as difficult to change your socks. ""Yo, Buzz, a little help here."" Since the Apollo missions, spacesuits have continued to change and advance, always reaching for the limits of science and imagination. Though, I am holding back a certain amount of praise for NASA until they finally engineer a loose-fitting space Snuggie. I mean, what's the point of going into the cosmos if you have to wear pants? Today, NASA is once again deep into developing a whole new spacesuit, and this time, you actually get to help decide the design. But just the appearance. Not any of the technical specs. That would just be reckless. ""It needs a beer holder! For your beer! Roll Tide!"" On Monday, voting started on the new Z-2 spacesuit. Participants can choose between three design models, all of which are so futuristically ridiculous that they are simply amazing. I love them. The new spacesuits are a direct improvement to the current prototype Z-1, which had a soft upper torso. The Z-2 is made of state-of-the-art hard composite, perfect for cage fighting on Mars. Which is probably the first thing we'll do with the Red Planet after we put up a Wal-Mart. The Z-2 is also the first spacesuit to use 3-D laser scanning and 3-D printing. Cast your vote here . So, clearly, there's a bit of serious technology going on here. Though, with all due respect to NASA, none of this stacks up to the vision and engineering of the Sports Illustrated football phone. Really, that thing was a technological wonder. But so are the new Z-2 spacesuits, and when you go online to vote, you'll have three options. The first option, ""Biomimicry,"" is inspired by the oceans of Earth and mimics some of the bioluminescent qualities of fish and reptiles. Its signature feature is electroluminescent wire that stretches across the upper torso and becomes visible in low light. To me, this is the least interesting of the three designs, though its reptilian outer shell might buy us some time with our new alien overlords. ""Gork, she sort of looks like us."" ""Your mom sort of looks like us."" ""Shut up, Gork."" The second design is called ""Technology"" and uses Luminex wire and light-emitting patches that can help crew members easily identify each other on spacewalks. It's actually a cool-looking design, but I'm pretty sure they could've just saved a bunch of money by stealing a box of those ""Hello, My Name is _____"" stickers from a company retreat. ""Oh, so you're Dave."" ""Dude, we just spent the last 250 days together in a space ship flying to Mars. How do you not know this?"" The third option is called ""Trends in Society,"" and with a bright color scheme mimicking athletic training gear, it's supposed to reflect what everyday clothes might look like in the future. Keeping to its name, the ""Trends in Society"" spacesuit proudly supports legalized marijuana and doesn't want to have kids. It's very progressive. Voting ends for the Z-2 project April 15, and the winning design will be revealed by April 30. After that, NASA expects to have the suit completed by November and will immediately begin testing with it at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. These tests will take place in vacuum chambers, a neutral buoyancy lab and a simulated Mars environment. ""Your mom is a simulated Mars environment."" ""Shut up, Gork.""

"When the United States unleashed 47 U.S. Navy Tomahawk missiles on September 22 on suspected Khorasan Group sites to the west of Aleppo, Syria, one of their top targets was an unlikely figure: David Drugeon, a 24-year-old French convert from Brittany who had become a key bomb-maker for the group. Intelligence suggested that Khorasan, a group of veteran core al Qaeda operatives who have found sanctuary in Idlib province and surrounding areas, was in the final stages of planning terrorist attacks in the West, including against American aviation. Among the devices Khorasan's bomb-makers were developing to try to beat airport security: bombs made out of clothing dipped in explosive solution and explosives concealed in personal electronics. U.S. officials told CNN's Barbara Starr and Pamela Brown on Wednesday that Drugeon may have been actively involved in these efforts, which also involved technology transfers from al Qaeda's master bomb-maker in Yemen, Ibrahim al Asiri. In July, the Transportation Security Administration banned cell phones without electronic charge from airplane cabins in response to the intelligence, much of it fragmentary, coming in on the plans. But the cruise missiles in September appear to have missed their mark. U.S. officials told CNN that Drugeon -- and Khorasan leader Muhsin al-Fadhli, a veteran Kuwaiti operative once close to Osama bin Laden -- almost certainly survived the strikes. It is unclear whether they were even at any of the locations that were targeted. That has left Drugeon free to continue plotting terrorist attacks against the West. His knowledge of explosives, European background and access to Western fighters in Syria makes him arguably one of the most dangerous operatives in the entire global al Qaeda network. Swift rise from unlikely beginnings . Drugeon was born in 1989 in a blue-collar and immigrant neighborhood dotted with social housing on the outskirts of Vannes on the Atlantic coast of Brittany, according to Eric Pelletier a reporter with L'Express who has extensively reported on Drugeon and shared his findings with CNN. By all accounts, Drugeon had a very normal childhood. His father was a bus driver and his mother a secretary and committed Catholic. He had an elder brother who shared his passion for the French soccer team Olympic Marseilles and he got good grades at school. But like a significant number of others who later took the path to radicalization, his parents' divorce when he was 13 was traumatic. Drugeon began acting out, and his grades at school nosedived. He began hanging out with a group of young Muslims in the neighborhood who espoused a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam. Before he turned 14 he converted, changing his name to Daoud. ""Drugeon was radicalized over a period of several years. A local imam played a key role. He was part of group of about a half dozen Salafi Muslims in the town,"" Pelletier told CNN. By 2010, Drugeon was on the radar screen of French security services and had made several trips to Egypt to learn Arabic and more about Islam. He funded the trips by taking driving jobs. In April that year, he slipped away from France for good, traveling via Cairo for the tribal areas of Pakistan, to join the jihad against U.S. forces in Afghanistan. According to Pelletier, French intelligence established that Drugeon joined a small al Qaeda subgroup known as Jund-al-Khilafah based in the Miran Shah area. CNN understands their knowledge of his involvement in the group came partly from the interrogation of one of the group's fighters held in Kazakhstan. Security sources in Kazakhstan confirmed the incarceration to CNN. The group was led by Moez Garsallaoui, a Francophone Tunisian operative married to Malika el Aroud, a Belgian-Moroccan ""al Qaeda living legend"" imprisoned for terrorism offences in Belgium whose deceased previous husband had assassinated Ahmed Shah Massoud, the head of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, on bin Laden's orders two days before 9/11. I interviewed el Aroud and Garsallaoui for CNN in 2006. Taking tea with a terrorist . From Pakistan to Syria? Drugeon first learned how to make bombs in the tribal areas of Pakistan, and over time became skilled in making explosives. He took on a new fighting name ""Souleiman"" and made several forays into Afghanistan, according to Pelletier. In September 2011, Drugeon likely came into contact with a new recruit into the group, a French-Algerian from Toulouse named Mohammed Merah, who in March 2012 would kill seven, including three Jewish schoolchildren, in a spree of shootings in southern France. Investigations shed new light on Toulouse terrorist shootings . During the short time Merah spent with the group, he was offered explosives instruction, but instead opted for shooting practice. It is possible Drugeon helped inspire the terrorist shootings in southern France. Besieged in his apartment in Toulouse in a final stand before his death, Merah told French negotiators over a walkie-talkie that ""an al Qaeda brother"" in Pakistan who had spent time in France helped persuade him to return to France to launch attacks. Before returning to France, Merah agreed with Garsallaoui that the latter could claim credit for any attack he launched back in his home country, which the Tunisian operative duly did before being killed in a U.S. drone strike later that year. Drugeon is believed to have left Pakistan some time in 2013 or very early 2014, and to have traveled to Syria to join up with the Khorasan group. A significant number of al Qaeda operatives were making the same journey, convinced that Syria now offered a better sanctuary away from the sight lines of U.S. drones. U.S. officials told CNN they believe Drugeon has been heavily involved in facilitating the movement of fighters back and forth from Europe, and in planning attacks in Europe. The potential threat from Drugeon is ""preoccupying the entire French intelligence establishment,"" Pelletier told CNN. The skilled French bomb-maker has an unprecedented large potential pool of Western extremists he can recruit for attacks. According to European counterterrorism officials, more than 3,000 Europeans have traveled to fight in Syria. The mix there of sophisticated explosive technology and Western passport holders is a perfect storm that is keeping Western officials up at night.","Al Qaeda bomb-maker is a French convert .

"(CNN) -- Add Gene Simmons to the list of people pulling the plug on rock 'n' roll. In an interview with Esquire conducted by his son, Nick, legendary rocker and KISS frontman Simmons said that -- thanks to a crumbling business model, including ""file-sharing and downloading"" by fans who believe they ""were entitled to have something for free"" -- ""rock is finally dead."" ""I am so sad that the next 15-year-old kid in a garage someplace in St. Paul, that plugs into his Marshall and wants to turn it up to 10, will not have anywhere near the same opportunity that I did,"" Simmons said. ""He will most likely, no matter what he does, fail miserably."" Simmons blamed a lack of industry support, piracy and a lack of appreciation for ""the creators."" ""It's very sad for new bands. ... They just don't have a chance,"" he said. ""You're better off not even learning how to play guitar or write songs."" Today's songwriters and creators are more likely to work behind the scenes than practicing and testing their material out on stage, he added. ""The death of rock was not a natural death. Rock did not die of old age. It was murdered,"" he said. Simmons, of course, is far from the first to lament the decline of rock. In 1972, the Who sang ""Rock is dead, they say"" in ""Long Live Rock,"" a finger in the eye to those who believed the music wasn't what it was a few years earlier. In 2009, guitarist and ""Underground Garage"" host Steven Van Zandt gave a speech at SXSW, ""A Crisis of Craft,"" that observed that one reason nobody's buying records is ""because they suck."" In blogs and on Twitter, reaction was largely negative to Simmons' statements. ""Business models for the music industry will come and go. But rock will never die,"" wrote Bill Brenner. ""So What's This About Rock Finally Being Dead? I Beg to Disagree, Gene Simmons,"" was the headline of a column by Alan Cross on ""A Journal of Musical Things."" And the Foo Fighters were probably the pithiest. ""Not so fast, Mr. God of Thunder,"" the Dave Grohl-led band tweeted. Simmons, however, doesn't think there's much future in the genre. ""It's clear that longevity is practically dead, and new artists that stand the test of time ... are so rare as to almost be nonexistent,"" he said.","Gene Simmons asserts that ""rock is dead"" in Esquire interview .

"Boko Haram kidnappers are still holding 187 girls captive more than a week after the Islamists abducted them from their dormitories in northeastern Nigeria, according to school and government officials. The figure is much higher than the one earlier released by authorities. ""A total of 230 parents registered the names of their daughters who were missing on the day of the kidnap,"" said Asabe Kwambura, principal of the Government Girls Secondary School in the town of Chibok. ""From my records, 43 girls have so far escaped on their own from their kidnappers. We still have 187 girls missing,"" the principal said. The school asked parents to come forward and register the names of their missing daughters a day after the April 14 kidnapping. Borno state government officials insisted only 129 girls were originally abducted from the school, and had said that 51 escaped. Isa Umar Gusau, the spokesman for Borno state's governor, said the escape of seven more girls on Sunday reduced the number of girls in the custody of their Boko Haram abductors to 77. Kwambura disputed Gusau's claim of seven more escapes. ""I'm not aware of any seven girls that escaped on Sunday,"" the principal said. Borno state Education Commissioner Musa Inuwa Kubo confirmed the numbers released by Kwambura and sought to explain the discrepancies in figures provided by the government and the school. ""There was break in communication which resulted in a lack of coordination, as a result of which different figures were provided,"" Kubo said. ""But the opening of a register ... provided an avenue where parents of missing children recorded the names of their daughters, which furnished us with a comprehensive list of girls taken away and those that were able to escape,"" the commissioner added. Families becoming impatient . In Chibok, angry parents are becoming impatient, accusing military and state authorities of playing politics with the lives and safety of their children. ""It is unfortunate that the kidnap of our girls is being politicized, with so many false claims by the military and the government,"" said Chibok resident Haladu Sule. ""Parents and vigilantes have suspended searches for the kidnapped girls since Thursday and we are not aware of any military rescue operation going on,"" Sule said, disputing claims that the military is conducting ongoing rescue operations. Enoch Mark, a father whose daughter and two nieces were among the kidnapped girls, also doubted the military's claim. He and hundreds of other Chibok residents, as well as people from nearby villages, went into the forest on motorcycles on April 19.  They followed the tracks of the kidnappers up to Baale village, close to the camp where the girls were being held. During their nine-hour, 100-kilometer trek, they never saw a single soldier, Mark said. Villagers told them the gunmen had passed through ""and were camped with the girls in a creek some hundreds of meters outside the village."" Some of the girls had even been brought back to the village at gunpoint to fetch water. ""We were warned by residents of Baale not to proceed, saying they feared for our lives because our sticks and (outdated)  guns were no match for the heavy arms of the Boko Haram gunmen,"" he explained. ""The villagers warned us we would all be killed if we dared face the gunmen and would put the lives of our daughters in danger.  We have therefore abandoned the search for our daughters since we know where they are but we don't have the capacity to liberate them,"" Mark added. Some managed to escape . The father of a girl who escaped with two other girls from their abductors on April 16 also said they had been held at gunpoint. ""She told us that all the girls were gathered under trees in the forest under constant watch of gunmen,"" said the father, who asked not to be named for security reasons. ""My daughter was among those selected by the kidnappers to cook food and she and two other girls cooking together came up with a plan. They told their kidnappers they needed to use the bathroom,"" said the father. The girls ran off once they were out of view of their armed guards until they came across a village, where residents helped them get back to Chibok. Barnabas Yakubu, a Chibok resident, wondered why the government failed to act on information supplied by residents about the location of the Boko Haram camp near Baale village. But Kubo said the government and the military were ""doing everything possible"" to secure the release of the schoolgirls. ""This is a delicate situation that requires careful handling,"" Kubo said. ""When you have heavily armed men holding close to 200 girls hostage, you have to be very careful in your approach so as not to risk the safety of these girls you want to rescue. ""It is a security issue and we just can't be divulging all the efforts we are making to get these girls freed,"" the education commissioner explained.","The girls were abducted from their dormitories in northeastern Nigeria on April 14 .

"(CNN) -- Over the past decade, an increasing percentage of Americans lost health insurance coverage because they couldn't afford it. As a family physician, I have seen the devastating effects of losing health insurance. Without it, patients die unnecessarily. Since passage of the Affordable Care Act, it is heartwarming to see patients gain insurance, get healthier and catch up on health care services they were unable to obtain before. But it is heartbreaking to see the Herculean efforts to eliminate subsidies that made it possible for these working Americans to finally afford health insurance. Recently, there have been two opposing court of appeals rulings on a crucial aspect of the ACA. The first, if it eventually prevails, would not allow about 4.5 million people who gained subsidized insurance in the federal exchanges to get financial assistance. Thankfully, a different court of appeals found just the opposite. FAQ: What the Obamacare court decisions mean for you . There will be no shortage of court challenges trying to chip away at the Affordable Care Act, but gutting the ACA would just strip patients of their means to obtain cancer treatment and other life-saving health care. Two years ago, I diagnosed a 52-year-old uninsured man with Stage IV colon cancer, which took his life. Months earlier, he had noticed blood in his stool and had been scheduled for a colonoscopy. Without health insurance to pay for this costly test, he postponed it while waiting for financial assistance to help him buy health insurance coverage. It is likely that a health insurance subsidy would have saved his life. Appeals courts differ on Obamacare; Supreme Court case likely . Another patient, diagnosed with Stage I breast cancer on a routine mammogram, said to me: ""Doc, I don't care whether I have to eat beans and rice every day for the rest of my life, I am saving every cent to hold onto my health insurance because it will save my life!"" She is now cancer-free and living a full and meaningful life. Health insurance saves lives. When Massachusetts expanded health insurance coverage through policies similar to Obamacare, the state death rate fell by nearly 3% in the four years after the law went into effect. The decline was steepest in counties with the highest proportions of poor and previously uninsured people. Study: Obamacare gave 10 million Americans health insurance . In other states with populations similar to Massachusetts, the death rate was largely unchanged. For every 830 people who gained health insurance in Massachusetts, one life was saved. Nationally, this 3% decline in mortality among adults under age 65 translates to about 17,000 fewer people dying each year. Health insurance matters for health and well-being. Americans with health insurance are far more likely to receive primary and preventive care as well as timely and appropriate care for chronic conditions. Without health insurance, Americans have significantly more unmet health care needs and higher rates of delayed care. When faced with illness, the uninsured are forced to make an impossible choice: incur unaffordable health care costs or gamble on their health, forgoing needed care. The Affordable Care Act enables millions of uninsured Americans to gain coverage and finally shed the fears of what might happen to themselves and their families if faced with this impossible choice. Watchdog: Fake applicants got Obamacare subsidies . Let's keep moving forward with covering the uninsured in this country, there's no time to waste. The millions of dollars being spent in courts across the country to challenge the ACA and to eliminate insurance subsidies for working Americans might be better spent to create subsidies ensuring access to health insurance coverage that saves lives. I have been involved in efforts as a physician-scientist working to discover new cures for the American epidemic of ""uninsurance"" and finding new treatments for our nation's ""inequitable access to care"" disease. Recently, I heard several top scientists debating whether we should keep asking the question: ""Does health insurance matter?"" Consider the following two questions. Are you willing to drop your health insurance policy immediately and go without health insurance indefinitely? Are you willing to enroll in a study where you are randomized to receive health insurance or go without health insurance for a long period? If your answer to either or both of these questions is ""no,"" then we should stop asking whether insurance matters and move forward toward insuring every American. There's no time to waste in court battles. Americans are dying unnecessarily. And, the U.S. health care system has plenty more problems in need of immediate and urgent attention, including the primary care workforce shortage, the unsustainable costs of care and the disparities in health care access. Let's get people insured.","Before Obamacare, Jennifer DeVoe saw people lose insurance and suffer .

"Ariel Sharon, whose half century as a military and political leader in Israel was marked with victories and controversies, died Saturday after eight years in a coma, Israeli Army Radio reported.  Sharon was 85. Sharon died at Sheba Medical Center in the Tel Aviv suburb of Tel Hashomer. The Israeli statesman was a national war hero to many Israelis for his leadership, both in uniform or as a civilian, during every Israeli war. Israelis mourn loss of former leader . Many in the Arab world called Sharon ""the Butcher of Beirut"" after he oversaw Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon while serving as defense minister. He was a major figure in many defining events in the Middle East for decades, including his decision to turn over Gaza and parts of the West Bank to Palestinian control. Throughout, he was called ""The Bulldozer,"" a fearless leader who got things done. Ariel Sharon: Five things to know . The reaction in his own right-wing Likud Party to his order to the military to drag some Israeli settlers from their homes in Gaza led Sharon in November 2005 to form the political party Kadima, Hebrew for ""Forward."" He was in his fifth year as prime minister when he suffered a massive stroke in January 2006, which left him comatose. Ehud Olmert, who became interim prime minister after Sharon's stroke, assumed the role of prime minister after leading the Kadima Party to an election victory in March 2006. Sharon's career was closely tied to Israel's relationship with Lebanon. A life on front lines of war and politics . During the Lebanon war in 1982, Sharon, a former army general then serving as Israeli defense minister, was held indirectly responsible by an Israeli inquiry in 1983 for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. He was forced to resign. Sharon, who lived on a ranch in the Negev Desert, became prime minister on March 7, 2001. He was the man who encouraged Israelis to establish settlements on occupied Palestinian land, but he also was the leader who pushed for Israel's historic 2005 withdrawal from 25 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, which was turned over to Palestinian rule for the first time in 38 years. Ariel Sharon: Fast Facts . Sharon formed the centrist Kadima in an effort to build political support for his controversial plan to turn over Gaza and parts of the West Bank to Palestinian control. In grappling with the decades-long conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, Sharon said in 2001, ""I can talk and look in the eyes of the citizens of Israel and convince them to make painful compromises."" As waves of suicide bombings by militants rocked Israel, Sharon sent tanks and troops into Palestinian towns, ordering assassinations of Palestinian militant leaders. Sharon ordered construction of the barrier through the West Bank and confined then-Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat, whom he called ""a terrorist,"" to his compound in Ramallah, accusing him of encouraging attacks on Israel. This veteran of all of Israel's wars was a national hero to many. In 1953, after a wave of terrorist attacks from Jordan, Sharon the military leader led the infamous Unit 101 on a raid into the border town of Kibya, blowing up 45 houses and killing 69 Arab villagers. Sharon said he thought the houses were empty. In June 1967, as a general, Sharon led his tank battalion to a crushing victory over the Egyptians in the Sinai during the Six Day War. But what he considered his greatest military success came in 1973 during the Yom Kippur War. He surrounded Egypt's Third Army and, defying orders, led 200 tanks and 5,000 men over the Suez Canal, a turning point in the war. As defense minister, Sharon was the architect of Israel's invasion of Lebanon, an occupation meant to stop the Palestine Liberation Organization from using Lebanon as a base for attacks on Israel. The attack was disastrous. After the Sabra and Shatila massacre, he allowed Israeli families to settle in occupied Palestinian land, the same land Palestinians claimed as a future state. As a result of the inquiry, however, Sharon was forced to stand down and was banned from ever being defense minister again. ""He felt betrayed by his government,"" said his adviser, Ranaan Gissin. Sharon made a political comeback in the 1990s, eventually becoming leader of his party in 2000. That year, he faced more trouble when he visited the holiest site for Jews, the Temple Mount in Jerusalem -- known to Muslims as Haram al Sharif, ""The Noble Sanctuary."" The stop sparked violent protests. The incident prompted the second Intifada -- the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule -- that began in September of that year. Throughout his career, both in the military and in politics, Sharon was the man Israelis turned to when they thought they had no other choice. Either leading from the front or calling the shots as an elected leader, he was always the soldier. Even in his later years out of uniform, his military demeanor was just below the surface. He never delivered on his promise of peace and security. Sharon was born on a farm outside Tel Aviv. The son of Russian immigrants, he always remembered a lesson from his father as he ascended to the highest office in Israel. ""When my father saw that I was tired, he would stop for a minute and say, 'Look how much we have done already,'"" he once explained.","Ariel Sharon was 85 .

"Bethesda, Maryland (CNN) -- When Jonathan Legg of Bethesda, Maryland, got a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at 39, he was shocked. ""I had always been pretty active,"" said Legg. ""But it was a big wake-up call, that what I was doing and my current weight were not OK."" That was two years ago. Since that time, the Morgan Stanley executive decided to make some changes and reverse his diabetes. Although his doctor recommended he go on medication to control his illness, Legg took a different approach. Instead of meds, he began to exercise every day and changed his diet, cutting out alcohol, fatty foods and watching his carbs. Do you have diabetes? How well are you managing it? ""I wanted to be able to know the changes I was making were making a difference, and it wasn't the drug,"" said Legg. According to new statistics just out from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 25.8 million people, or 8.3% of the U.S. population, are affected by either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Most, like Legg, have type 2 diabetes, which in many people develops later in life. Caused primarily by genetic makeup, a sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits, type 2 diabetes can be reversed in some cases. By making changes to their lives such as adding exercise and improving their diets, many type 2 diabetics can drop their glucose or sugar numbers back to the normal range, reversing their condition. ""We have seen numerous people reverse their condition,"" says Dr. Michelle Magee, director of the MedStar Diabetes Institute in Washington. ""But it takes a real dedication for the rest of their lives,"" she notes. So why do exercise and diet help reverse diabetes? To answer that question, we first need to know why people get diabetes in the first place. Diabetes is caused when there is too much glucose or sugar in the body. We get sugar from the things we eat. The body is designed to process sugar so it can enter our cells and provide energy. But glucose can't enter our cells without insulin, which is a hormone produced by the pancreas. If you have diabetes, your body isn't making any or is not making enough insulin -- or it can't properly use the insulin it is producing. As a result, too much sugar stays in the blood. If this occurs for a long time, it can lead to serious problems. Tips for dealing with diabetes . Type 1 diabetes was once known as juvenile diabetes because it's usually diagnosed in children and young adults. About 5% to 10% of all people with diabetes have this type, which is not reversible because the person's pancreas is not producing insulin at all. The remainder have type 2 diabetes. For these people, their body can no longer process insulin correctly. Although genetics plays a part, obesity is a major reason people develop type 2 diabetes. ""We know that excess body weight adversely affects every organ system in the body,"" says Dr. Gary Foster, director of Temple University's Center for Obesity Research and Education in Philadelphia. ""So it shouldn't be surprising that as obesity increases, as it has over the past 30 years, that medical conditions, especially conditions like type 2 diabetes, will also increase."" People who carry excess weight, especially in their midsection, are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes because the fat in their tissues causes an imbalance of insulin in the body. The condition is called insulin resistance. If they can eliminate that fat by exercising and limiting carbohydrates and alcohol, then many can drop their glucose levels. And for some, they can drop them back into the normal range. This is also true for people who are prediabetic. According to the CDC, 79 million Americans are prediabetic, which means their glucose readings fall between 100 and 125 while fasting. According to the American Diabetes Association, normal glucose readings are 100 and below when a person has not eaten anything. Numbers above 125 while fasting are considered to be in the diabetic range. So when you're prediabetic, it's easier to turn those numbers around. And that's important, because once you become a diabetic, even if you drop your numbers, you will always be classified as a diabetic, making it difficult to acquire good insurance. ""Once you fall into that glucose range, you are considered at high risk for developing the condition again,"" says Magee. ""That's why we are working on a program right now that goes into the community and reaches those who are at risk of being prediabetic or diabetic,"" Magee said. ""The results have been so positive, the CDC is looking at the program as a possible protocol for other hospitals to follow."" As for Jonathan Legg, his numbers are no longer in the diabetic range. He's lost 40 pounds and watches everything he eats. ""I educated myself, I read the labels,"" said Legg. ""I enjoy what I eat. I met with nutritionists, and they helped me build a game plan."" His physician, Dr. Lucy McBride of Foxhall Internists in Washington, D.C., says it's more than just diet; it's also the types of foods that Legg eats. ""He cut out significant amounts of sugar and carbs in his diet, really changed how he ate,"" says McBride. ""He's increased fiber, increased protein, cut back on alcohol, which is really sugar."" But McBride notes Legg needs to be tenacious. ""I told him, encouraged as I was, and proud and pleased [but] he's got to keep up those lifestyle habits for things to stay in the right direction,"" McBride said. ""Without exercise, without diet and without weight control, the diabetes will come back. It's something he will need to manage his whole life."" That's something Legg says he would rather do than live as a diabetic.","Jonathan Legg began to exercise every day,  changed diet to reverse diabetes .

"When, in 2002, Denzel Washington and Halle Berry won both lead-acting honors at the Academy Awards, pundits and spin doctors were anxious to declare that the Oscars had achieved a great black apotheosis. They were off by, well, 12 years, . As in ""12 Years a Slave,"" which won three Oscars  at Sunday night's ceremony. These included best picture, a prize many believed would go to its closest competitor, the space thriller ""Gravity"" -- a film that did win seven Oscars of its own Sunday night, including one for its director, Alfonso Cuaron. And though ""Slave's"" British director Steve McQueen missed out on becoming the first black filmmaker to win for best director, it seemed altogether appropriate for him to have had the last word with best picture during a ceremony more auspicious for African-American talent than any of its predecessors. Whether it was the thunderous ovation that greeted Lupita Nyong'o as she accepted the best supporting actress prize for ""12 Years a Slave,"" or the rousing reception that veteran pop vocalist Darlene Love received for her spontaneous a capella chorus of ""His Eye is on the Sparrow"" as the documentary ""20 Feet from Stardom"" received the best documentary prize, there was a sense that in the variety of awards and recognition, black artists in film were no longer announcing their arrival. They were there to stay. This prospect gets further context in a year that also saw the release of two commercially successful films, ""Fruitvale Station"" and ""Lee Daniels' The Butler,"" that both emerged from and further stimulated the ongoing transition in America's racial dialogue. And if there was any doubt as to the significance of this night's milestones, it was emphatically erased by the appearance of 87-year-old Sidney Poitier, who, though frail and struggling to speak, nonetheless accepted a sustained standing ovation from the audience as he leaned on Angelina Jolie for support. He was there to mark the 50th anniversary of his groundbreaking win of the 1963 best actor Oscar for ""Lilies of the Field."" He and Jolie  presented  screenwriting honors, one of which went to John Ridley, whose win for best adapted screenplay for ""12 Years a Slave"" made him only the second African-American to win a writing Oscar. These were the most momentous aspects of a ceremony that otherwise cruised along in a laid-back groove, conspicuous in its relative dearth of snarkiness, thanks mostly to this year's host, Ellen DeGeneres, a daytime-TV-certified Nice Person, whose female impersonator joke at Liza Minnelli's expense early in the proceedings was about as nasty as things got all night. And while Minnelli did not look amused at first, she seemed an enthusiastic participant in the evening's most ""tweet"" running gag: the ""selfie"" riff. DeGeneres spread it out into the audience, drawing Meryl Streep and everybody else in the first rows into a selfie that quickly set a retweet record, and apparently temporarily broke Twitter's platform. It all seemed very baggy-sweater cozy and fun to watch. But would it be, well, snarky to suggest that the camera phone she was springing into action was provided by Samsung, one of the broadcast's biggest sponsors? It's tough playing the spoilsport for what some might consider the sweetest Academy Awards ceremony in years -- and others might call the most cloying. There was little opportunity for embarrassment as the evening clipped cheerfully along, and even the disorienting sight of 81-year-old Kim Novak's facelift was mitigated by best actor winner Matthew McConaughey's courtly grace as they presented the animation prizes. One remembers what novelist and screenwriter Raymond Chandler once wrote about the awards back in 1949 -- that they are a manifestation of Hollywood's ""chronic case of spurious excitement over absolutely nothing."" He's still not altogether wrong. Any Academy Awards ceremony can seem like a water drop on the linoleum counter of history. It leaves no stain, no residue. It just evaporates. But thanks to ""12 Years a Slave,"" maybe not this one.","Gene Seymour: Oscar wins like ""12 Years a Slave"" show black artists here to stay in Hollywood .

"(CNN) -- In just four days, Chris Picco went from husband and expectant father to a man without a family. His wife Ashley died November 8; their newborn son, delivered by emergency cesarean section, died three days later. In August, Ashley and Chris Picco celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary by posting a photo to Facebook. In the image, a tiny pair of fur-lined baby booties stands empty between the Southern California couple. ""Coming Soon"" is inscribed above. It is still Ashley's cover photo. Ashley was a mother for only a few short hours before she died. She left behind ""harmonies that will continue to resonate in our hearts and memories,"" her family and friends posted online. Lennon James was born by emergency C-section three months early, ""fighting for his life,"" Chris posted. Although Chris was grieving Ashley's loss, he thanked those who had reached out in several online postings. ""It's impossible to sum up what has happened in the past couple of days,"" he said. ""My wife, best friend and mother of my child passed away. I have a lifetime to grieve this unspeakable loss, but I know that right now she would want me to focus completely on baby Lennon James Picco..."" On Wednesday, a friend posted a video of Chris in the hospital, singing to his newborn son. The video shows Chris seated next to a whirring, clicking incubator, baby Lennon swaddled in blankets and surrounded by tubes. The video was recorded Tuesday, when Chris had posted, ""Ashley would often feel Lennon moving to music, so I brought my guitar today and gave him a little concert."" The song Chris chose, ""Blackbird,"" was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney during their time with the Beatles. The song begins: . ""Blackbird singing in the dead of night . Take these broken wings and learn to fly . All your life . You were only waiting for this moment to arise."" Little Lennon James Pico died late Tuesday night in his father's arms. On Wednesday, Chris posted this update: . ""Dear friends, family, and supporters; it is with an unbelievably heavy heart that I write this. My little fighter, Lennon James Picco went to sleep in his daddy's arms late last night. He was surrounded by family, friends, and the best doctors, nurses and hospital staff in the world. He was dressed in an outfit that Ashley bought for him, with little guitars on it, and wrapped in a blanket made by a dear friend. I am so thankful for the four unforgettable days I got to spend with him. His mommy would have been so beyond joy to see him and to hold him, touch him, bathe him, sing to him - as I have had the privilege of doing. I have been so blessed and honored to love him before he was formed, to cherish him while mommy carried him, meet him face to precious face, and hold his perfect little body while we said 'goodbye for now'. There are no words, but I wanted to keep you updated, as your love and support has meant more than anything in the world. All you need is love."" A spokesman for Chris said he wants to tell his story but needed time with family and friends for now. A memorial is planned for Saturday at the Piccos' church, Loma Linda University Church in Loma Linda, California.","The baby was born to a dying woman via emergency C-section .

"It's easy to guess what Malala Yousafzai would do with roughly $67,000. Spend it to educate children, particularly girls in her native Pakistan, she has said in the past. But it wasn't about the money when the 16-year-old, who survived a Taliban assassination attempt for her activism, picked up the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought from the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday. She tried not to make the occasion about herself, after accepting the blue framed plaque and walking up to the microphone in high heels. She had worn them to be seen over the podium, she explained to the audience. Instead, Malala turned her acceptance speech into a plea on behalf of nearly 60 million children around the world, who can't go to school. Starving children, who live in fear. Children who dodge bullets and bombs. Girls whose families lock them away from the world inside their homes. ""This must shake our conscience,"" she admonished parliamentarians gathered to celebrate her win. She told them that she hoped those in the West would see beyond their own borders to help them. She pleaded specifically for help in her own country. She told them that the prize would encourage her to keep standing up against the Pakistan Taliban for the sake of education and would continue her work. ""Because of terrorism, hundreds of schools have been destroyed,"" she said. Making an impression . To the crowd, which included 22 former prize winners, the ceremony, which took place on World Children's Day, was very much about Malala. They gave her a standing ovation. The teen, who still contends with nerve damage caused by a Taliban bullet, has impressed leaders in the parliament's chambers and around the world with her ""incredible strength,"" as Parliament President Martin Schulz put it when first announcing that she had won the award on October 10. The date was laden with symbolism. A year and a day before, she had faced down almost certain death to stand up for a girl's right to go to school, when a Pakistan Taliban gunman fired at her nearly point blank as she rode home from school on an improvised bus. It nearly killed her. Doctors in Pakistan scrambled to save her life -- as her brain swelled -- before flying her to the UK, where a medical team worked on her recovery. Malala is used to making public speeches on bravery and education. Her first, in September 2008, was titled ""How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to an education?"" the EU parliament said. In 2009, the Taliban banned girls from schools in Swat Valley, which she called home. She anonymously blogged for the BBC in opposition to that order and became an open advocate for girls' education. In 2011, Malala told CNN, ""I have the right of education. I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk."" Shared praise . Malala's father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, sat silently next to her while Schulz, of Germany, heaped praise upon her. While he listened to the translation from German into English through an earphone, Schulz singled him out. Malala would not be who she is without her father, he said. ""Your father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, is a teacher,"" he said.  ""He has expressed his views that boys and girls are equal.""  He encouraged her to blog and give interviews to the media, to protest against the Taliban, Schulz pointed out. ""Malala, I'm sure you are as proud of your father as he is of you,"" he said. While applauding her bravery in the face of an assignation attempt, Schulz reminded the audience that Malala has said that this is not what she wants to be remembered for. She wants to be known as a girl who fought oppression to build education for all.","The teen activist survived a Taliban assassination attempt .

"London (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's toast to Queen Elizabeth II on Tuesday was interrupted when the orchestra at the state dinner began playing ""God Save the Queen"" before Obama finished. Following the queen's toast to him and the playing of the U.S. national anthem, Obama began his toast by thanking her and commenting on her reign and the close ties between their countries. The president then asked the guests to stand and join him in toasting the queen. ""To Her Majesty the Queen,"" Obama began, but the orchestra -- apparently thinking the president had concluded -- started playing the British anthem. Obama continued with his toast, speaking over the music in citing the special relationship between the British and American people and quoting William Shakespeare's tribute to ""to this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England"" from ""Richard II."" ""To the queen,"" Obama concluded as the music played on. When the music ended, Obama repeated, ""to the queen,"" and the audience, clearly confused by the turn of events, delayed a few seconds before applauding.","Musicians apparently thought President Obama had concluded .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Implementing smoke-free policies can lead to fewer hospitalizations resulting from heart attacks, according to a new study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A new study says smoking ordinances can lead to fewer hospitalizations from heart attacks. Researchers studied the impact of smoke-free ordinances implemented in Pueblo, Colorado, in July 2003. They compared the number of hospitalizations for heart attacks 18 months before the policy went into effect and three years after implementation. The Pueblo Heart Study found that although 399 people were hospitalized for heart attacks before any smoke-free laws went into effect, that number dropped to 237 three years after the law's introduction, a 41 percent decline. The study was published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Wednesday. The accompanying editorial suggests that there may be several reasons the ordinance may have led to a reduction in the number of heart attack-related hospitalizations: . • The ordinance led to an immediate decrease in secondhand smoke exposure. • People who were forced to comply with smoke-free rules in public may have adopted a smoke-free environment at home and thus reduced the exposure to secondhand smoke even more. • Restrictions to where you can smoke may have led more people to quit smoking altogether. While the Colorado researcher didn't know if the study participants were smokers or non-smokers, the CDC's editorial points out that the new study adds to research from eight other studies, which also saw a drop in heart attack related hospitalizations after smoke-free laws are enforced. A 2006 Surgeon General report concluded that ""exposure of adults to secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer."" According to the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society, secondhand smoke is the combination of two types of smoke that is produced when burning tobacco: the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar or pipe and the smoke that is exhaled by the smoker. The Environmental Protection Agency has classified secondhand smoke as a known human cancer-causing agent. According to the cancer institute, there is no safe level of secondhand smoke, and it can have an immediate effect ""on a person's heart and blood vessels."" It may raise the risk of heart disease by 25 to 30 percent and cause about 46,000 heart disease deaths annually, according to the NCI Web site.","Researchers studied effects of anti-smoking ordinances in Colorado .

"Ballet dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko, often cast as the villain in Bolshoi Ballet productions, is now the lead defendant in a plot worthy of a Tchaikovsky score. The 29-year-old allegedly choreographed an attack intended to blind Bolshoi artistic director Sergei Filin, the man who put him in the roles of Ivan the Terrible and Swan Lake's evil genius. The mystery of who threw sulfuric acid into Filin's face in January has captivated Russians and kept Moscow detectives busy probing rivalries within Russia's renowned 240-year-old ballet company. It might well send Hollywood literary agents and producers scrambling for story details as described by police reports and local media accounts. Police declared their case was solved this week with a confession by Dmitrichenko . Russian police question suspect in Bolshoi director's acid attack . ""I organized this attack but not to the extent that it happened,"" he is heard saying in a video released by police. The characters in this drama include Dmitrichenko's girlfriend, Anzhelina Vorontsova. She has not been charged, but local newspapers quote ballet members as saying Dmitrichenko was angry because he thought Filin was stifling her career. Two alleged co-conspirators have been detained: Alleged hit man Yuri Zarutsky -- a burly, bearded Russian who was previously convicted of beating someone to death -- and Andrey Lipatov, who allegedly drove the getaway car after Zarutksy's battery acid attack on Filin. While the final act must still play out in a Russian courtroom, the story opens in the nearly two-century-old Bolshoi Theatre. Act 1 - The Bolshoi Theatre . Ballet is a world where competition is fierce, and where the artistic director wields considerable influence in making or breaking careers. Filin, 42, was promoted to the Bolshoi Theatre's coveted post in March 2011, shortly after the deputy ballet director, Gennady Yanin, who was widely seen as a favorite for the artistic director post, resigned when pornographic pictures of him surfaced online. There was ""fierce rivalry"" for the Bolshoi position at the time, according to the RIA Novosti news agency. That year, two dancers quit, unhappy with the direction the ballet had taken. Another dancer, Nikolai Tsiskaridze, loudly criticized Filin for going over budget in the ballet's multimllion-dollar renovation. Tsiskaridze, incidentally, was also a contender for the artistic director job that Filin got. But beyond professional disagreements, sinister factors were also at play. Act 2 - The Streets of Moscow . RIA Novosti reported that before the attack, Filin suffered months of intimidation, including threatening phone calls. Someone slashed his car tires. Somebody also attempted to hack his Facebook page. The trio of conspirators obtained battery acid at a car parts store, and made the acid stronger by evaporating the water from it, police said. Dmitrichenko, who studied Filin's schedule, called Lipatov and Zarutsky when he saw Filin leave the theater on the cold night of January 17, police said. As Filin entered the security code at the door of his Moscow apartment, authorities say, Zarutsky confronted him and tossed the sulfuric acid into his face.  It caused third-degree burns and left him blinded. Act 3 - Moscow Police Headquarters . Detectives pored over interviews with those who knew Filin and had suspicions about who would harm him. Other clues led them to several cell phones that Dmitrichenko had registered in other people's names, according to a police statement. Calls from those phones led investigators to Lipatov, the alleged driver. ""I didn't see what happened there,"" Lipatov told them in a video released by police. ""I just took Yuri there, waited for him and gave him a lift back."" When an interrogator asked Zarutsky about the crime, he allegedly said, ""I don't want to talk about it."" Police concluded a ""hostile relationship"" stemming from Dmitrichenko's professional interaction with Filin was his motive. Bolshoi Prima ballerina's grace under pressure . Act 4 - A Moscow Court . The three men faced a judge Thursday, who ordered that they be kept in police custody until the investigation is over. If convicted, the attackers could face up to eight years in jail for willfully inflicting damage on the health of another. It may take at least six months for Filin to recover from the burns. In the meantime, Galina Stepanenko, a former principal dancer, will run the company. She says she's going to follow Filin's plans and she believes the dancers will now be united by greater respect and care for each other. Doctors performed a skin graft on Filin and, after a second eye surgery, they were able to save his sight. His colleagues are now working to ensure his artistic vision isn't lost.

"Radio icon Casey Kasem's daughter visited her father Friday evening for the first time since he was taken to Washington state two weeks ago from California in a family dispute over his care, a CNN affiliate reported. To make that visit, daughter Kerri Kasem won court approval from a Kitsap County, Washington, judge earlier in the day, CNN affiliate KING reported. A feud is ongoing between daughter Kerri Kasem and Kasem's wife, Jean, over legal authority to care for Casey Kasem, 82, who has Lewy body disease, the second most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's. In early May, Casey Kasem was living in a California nursing home, Kerri Kasem said. Kerri Kasem won a California court order this month to become the temporary conservator for her ailing father, but he went missing for a few days before being found in Washington state with his wife, Kerri's stepmother. On Friday morning, a Kitsap County judge granted the daughter permission to visit her father one hour a day at a local home where Kasem and his wife are staying with close friends, the affiliate reported. ""I'm not going to say anything much except that I'm happy with how the court proceedings went today,"" Kerri Kasem said. Jean Kasem, however, was displeased with the outcome of Friday's court proceedings and told reporters, ""Shame on these children."" She then played an audio recording of what sounded like a groaning man, saying the moaning came from her husband when he heard about Friday's court activity, the affiliate reported. ""He's crying,"" Jean Kasem said. When Kerri Kasem showed up for her one-hour visit Friday evening, she and a companion were met by two security guards with motorcycles in the driveway, KING reported. One man's motorcycle vest said ""Combat Veterans"" on the back. There was a brief disagreement over whether Kerri Kasem's male companion would be allowed onto the house's premises, but the guard eventually admitted both of them, according to the news outlet. Kasem's daughter wins additional powers in court . One hour later, Kasem wiped away tears as she left the house. She made no comment to reporters. On Friday, Kerri Kasem also won court permission to take her father to the doctor, the affiliate reported. The Washington state judge will hold another hearing June 6 on whether the California court order naming her as her father's temporary conservator would also apply in Washington state, the affiliate reported. A California court also awarded Kerri Kasem temporary durable power of attorney and health care directive and has ordered Jean Kasem to surrender Casey Kasem's passport to the daughter. The California judge also ordered that Casey Kasem can't travel anywhere without a court order until a doctor clears him. Casey Kasem's other daughter, Julie Kasem, and her husband, Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, have said her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions. But Julie and Kerri Kasem and their brother, Mouner Kasem, have contended since last year that Jean Kasem has prevented the three from visiting their father. Jean Kasem said in court papers last year that the three children ""single-handedly and irreparably shattered"" the couple's lives by deploying public demonstrations and attacks in the media, according to CNN affiliate KCBS. Kerri Kasem's temporary conservatorship over her father is in effect until June 20, when another California court hearing is scheduled on whether to make the conservatorship permanent. U.S. radio listeners knew Kasem for decades as the host of music countdown shows ""American Top 40"" and ""Casey's Top 40."" He retired in 2009. Kasem was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon ""Scooby Doo"" and an announcer for NBC. All-time great DJs .","Judge approves one-hour daily visits between Casey Kasem, his daughter .
